      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44647">[[Aging]] is a major risk factor for most common [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] diseases, including [[mild cognitive impairment]], [[dementia]]s including [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[cerebrovascular disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[Lou Gehrig's disease]]. While much research has focused on diseases of aging, there are few informative studies on the molecular biology of the '''aging brain''' (usually spelled '''ageing brain''' in [[British English]]) in the absence of neurodegenerative disease or the neuropsychological profile of healthy older adults. However, research does suggest that the aging process is associated with several structural, chemical, and functional changes in the [[Human brain|brain]] as well as a host of neurocognitive changes. Recent reports in model organisms suggest that as organisms age, there are distinct changes in the [[Gene expression|expression of genes]] at the single neuron level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kadakkuzha|first1=Beena M|last2=Akhmedov|first2=Komolitdin|title=Age-associated bidirectional modulation of gene expression in single identified R15 neuron of Aplysia|journal=BMC Genomics|date=2013-12-14|volume=14|issue=1|pages=880|pmid=24330282|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-14-880|pmc=3909179}}&lt;/ref&gt; This page is devoted to reviewing the changes associated with healthy aging.

==Structural changes==
Aging entails many physical, biological, chemical, and psychological changes. Therefore, it is logical to assume the brain is no exception to this phenomenon. [[CT scan]]s have found that the [[Ventricular system|cerebral ventricles]] expand as a function of age. More recent [[MRI]] studies have reported age-related regional decreases in cerebral volume.&lt;ref name="Craic"&gt;{{cite book |last=Craik |first=F. |last2=Salthouse |first2=T. |year=2000 |title=The Handbook of Aging and Cognition |edition=2nd |location=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum |isbn=0-8058-2966-0 |oclc=44957002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raz 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raz |first=Naftali |year=2005 |title=Regional Brain Changes in Aging Healthy Adults: General Trends, Individual Differences and Modifiers |journal=Cereb. Cortex |volume=15 |issue=11 |pages=1676–1689 |pmid=15703252 |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhi044 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regional volume reduction is not uniform; some brain regions shrink at a rate of up to 1% per year, whereas others remain relatively stable until the end of the life-span.&lt;ref name="Raz 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raz |first=Naftali |last2=Rodrigue |first2=Karen M. |year=2006 |title=Differential aging of the brain: Patterns, cognitive correlates and modifiers |journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=730–748 |pmid=16919333 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2006.07.001 |url=http://www.rcgd.isr.umich.edu/life/Readings2007/Raz%20reading.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The brain is very complex, and is composed of many different areas and types of tissue, or matter. The different functions of different tissues in the brain may be more or less susceptible to age-induced changes.&lt;ref name="Craic"/&gt;  The brain matter can be broadly classified as either [[grey matter]], or [[white matter]]. Grey matter consists of [[cell bodies]] in the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] and subcortical nuclei, whereas white matter consists of tightly packed myelinated axons connecting the neurons of the [[cerebral cortex]] to each other and with the periphery.&lt;ref name="Craic"/&gt;

===Loss of neural circuits and brain plasticity===
[[Brain plasticity]] refers to the brain's ability to change structure and function.&lt;ref name="Kolb Whishaw 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolb|first1=Bryan|last2=Whishaw|first2=Ian Q.|title=BRAIN PLASTICITY AND BEHAVIOR|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=49| issue=1| year=1998| pages=43–64 | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.43 |pmid=9496621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kolb Gibb 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolb| first1=Bryan|last2=Gibb| first2=Robbin|last3=Robinson| first3=Terry E.|title=Brain plasticity and behavior|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=12|issue=1|year=2003|pages=1–5|issn=0963-7214|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.01210}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ties into the common phrase, "if you don't use it, you lose it," which is another way of saying, if you don't use it, your brain will devote less somatotopic space for it. One proposed mechanism for the observed age-related plasticity deficits in animals is the result of age-induced alterations in calcium regulation.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barnes |first=C. |last2=Burke |first2=S. |year=2006 |title=Neural plasticity in the ageing brain |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=30–40 |doi=10.1038/nrn1809 |pmid=16371948}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The changes in our abilities to handle calcium will ultimately influence neuronal firing and the ability to propagate [[action potentials]], which in turn would affect the ability of the brain to alter its structure or function (i.e. its plastic nature). Due to the complexity of the brain, with all of its structures and functions, it is logical to assume that some areas would be more vulnerable to aging than others. Two circuits worth mentioning here are the [[hippocampal]] and neocortical circuits.&lt;ref name="Hof 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hof PR, Morrison JH |title=The aging brain: morphomolecular senescence of cortical circuits |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=27 |issue=10 |pages=607–13 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15374672 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2004.07.013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that age-related cognitive decline is due in part not to neuronal death but to synaptic alterations. Evidence in support of this idea from animal work has also suggested that this cognitive deficit is due to functional and [[biochemical]] factors such as changes in enzymatic activity, chemical messengers, or gene expression in cortical circuits.&lt;ref name ="Hof 2004"/&gt;

===Thinning of the cortex===
Advances in MRI technology have provided the ability to see the brain structure in great detail in an easy, non-invasive manner in vivo.&lt;ref name="Sowell 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sowell ER, Peterson BS, Thompson PM, Welcome SE, Henkenius AL, Toga AW |title=Mapping cortical change across the human life span |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=309–15 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12548289 |doi=10.1038/nn1008 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bartzokis ''et al.'', has noted that there is a decrease in [[grey matter]] volume between adulthood and old age, whereas [[white matter]] volume was found to increase from age 19-40, and decline after this age.&lt;ref name="Sowell 2003"/&gt; Studies using [[Voxel-based morphometry]] have identified areas such as the [[Insular cortex|insula]] and superior parietal gyri as being especially vulnerable to age-related losses in grey matter of older adults.&lt;ref name="Sowell 2003"/&gt; Sowell ''et al.'', reported that the first 6 decades of an individual's life were correlated with the most rapid decreases in grey matter density, and this occurred over dorsal, frontal, and [[parietal lobes]] on both interhemispheric and lateral brain surfaces. It is also worth noting that areas such as the [[cingulate gyrus]], and [[occipital cortex]] surrounding the [[calcarine sulcus]] appear exempt from this decrease in grey matter density over time.&lt;ref name="Sowell 2003"/&gt;  Age effects on grey matter density in the posterior temporal cortex appear more predominantly in the left versus right hemisphere, and were confined to posterior language cortices. Certain language functions such as word retrieval and production were found to be located to more anterior language cortices, and deteriorate as a function of age. Sowell et al., also reported that these anterior language cortices were found to mature and decline earlier than the more posterior language cortices.&lt;ref name="Sowell 2003"/&gt; It has also been found that the width of [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulcus]] not only increases with age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tao Liu |author2=Wei Wen |author3=Wanlin Zhu |author4=Julian Trollor |author5=Simone Reppermund |author6=John Crawford |author7=Jesse S Jin |author8=Suhuai Luo |author9=Henry Brodaty |author10=Perminder Sachdev |year=2010 |title=The effects of age and sex on cortical sulci in the elderly |journal=[[NeuroImage]] |volume=51 |issue=1 |pmid=20156569 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.02.016 |pages=19–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also with cognitive decline in the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tao Liu |author2=Wei Wen |author3=Wanlin Zhu |author4=Nicole A Kochan |author5=Julian N Trollor |author6=Simone Reppermund |author7=Jesse S Jin |author8=Suhuai Luo |author9=Henry Brodaty |author10=Perminder S Sachdev |year=2011 |title=The relationship between cortical sulcal variability and cognitive performance in the elderly |journal=NeuroImage |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=865–873 |pmid=21397704 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.03.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age-related neuronal morphology===
There is converging evidence from cognitive neuroscientists around the world that age-induced cognitive deficits may not be due to neuronal loss or cell death, but rather may be the result of small region-specific changes to the morphology of neurons.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; Studies by Duan et al., have shown that dendritic arbors and [[dendritic spines]] of cortical pyramidal neurons decrease in size and/or number in specific regions and layers of human and non-human primate cortex as a result of age (Duan ''et al.'', 2003; morph). A 46% decrease in spine number and spine density has been reported in humans older than 50 compared with younger individuals.&lt;ref name="Hof 2004"/&gt; An electron microscopy study in monkeys reported a 50% loss in spines on the apical dendritic tufts of pyramidal cells in [[prefrontal cortex]] of old animals (27–32 years old) compared with young ones (6–9 years old).&lt;ref name="Hof 2004"/&gt;

====Neurofibrillary tangles====
Age-related neuro-pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, [[Parkinson's disease]], [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]] and [[arteriosclerosis]] make it difficult to distinguish the normal patterns of aging.&lt;ref name="pmid27045845"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Habes M, Janowitz D, Erus G, Toledo JB, Resnick SM, Doshi J, Van der Auwera S, Wittfeld K, Hegenscheid K, Hosten N, Biffar R, Homuth G, Völzke H, Grabe HJ, Hoffmann W, Davatzikos C | title=Advanced brain aging: relationship with epidemiologic and genetic risk factors, and overlap with Alzheimer disease atrophy patterns | journal= [[Translational Psychiatry]] | volume=6 | issue=4 | year=2016 | pages=e775 | url=http://www.nature.com/tp/journal/v6/n4/abs/tp201639a.html |  doi=10.1038/tp.2016.39 | pmid=27045845 | pmc=4872397}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gabrieli"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gabrieli |first=J. |last2=Hedden |first2=T. |year=2004 |title=Insights into the ageing mind: a view from cognitive neuroscience |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=87–96 |doi=10.1038/nrn1323 |pmid=14735112}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the important differences between normal aging and pathological aging is the location of [[neurofibrillary tangles]].  Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of paired helical filaments (PHF).&lt;ref name="Anderton 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author =Anderton BH |title=Ageing of the brain |journal=Mech. Ageing Dev. |volume=123 |issue=7 |pages=811–7 |date=April 2002 |pmid=11869738 |doi=10.1016/S0047-6374(01)00426-2 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In normal, non-demented aging, the number of tangles in each affected cell body is relatively low&lt;ref name="Anderton 2002"/&gt; and restricted to the olfactory nucleus, parahippocampal gyrus, [[amygdala]] and entorhinal cortex.&lt;ref name="Davis 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davis |first=P. |last2=Morris |first2=J. |year=1991 |title=The distribution of tangles, plaques, and related immunohistochemical markers in healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease |journal=Neurobiology of Aging |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=295–312 |pmid=1961359|doi=10.1016/0197-4580(91)90006-6 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the non-demented individual ages, there is a general increase in the density of tangles, but no significant difference in where tangles are found.&lt;ref name="Davis 1991"/&gt; The other main neurodegenerative contributor commonly found in the brain of patients with AD is [[amyloid plaques]].  However, unlike tangles, plaques have not been found to be a consistent feature of normal aging.&lt;ref name="Davis 1991"/&gt;

===Role of oxidative stress===
{{Main|Oxidative stress}}
Cognitive impairment has been attributed to oxidative stress, inflammatory reactions and changes in the cerebral microvasculature.&lt;ref name="Whalley 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Whalley LJ, Deary IJ, Appleton CL, Starr JM |title=Cognitive reserve and the neurobiology of cognitive aging |journal=Ageing Res. Rev. |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=369–82 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15541707 |doi=10.1016/j.arr.2004.05.001 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exact impact of each of these mechanisms in affecting cognitive aging is unknown.  Oxidative stress is the most controllable risk factor and is the best understood.  The online Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary defines oxidative stress as,  "physiological stress on the body that is caused by the cumulative damage done by [[free radicals]] inadequately neutralized by antioxidants and that is to be associated with aging."&lt;ref&gt;Oxidative Stress. (n.d.) In Merriam-Webster Dictionary online.  Retrieved from http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/oxidative stress&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence oxidative stress is the damage done to the cells by free radicals that have been released from the oxidation process.

Compared to other tissues in the body, the brain is deemed unusually sensitive to oxidative damage.&lt;ref name="Keller 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keller JN, Schmitt FA, Scheff SW |title=Evidence of increased oxidative damage in subjects with mild cognitive impairment |journal=Neurology |volume=64 |issue=7 |pages=1152–6 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15824339 |doi=10.1212/01.WNL.0000156156.13641.BA |url=http://www.chem.uky.edu/research/butterfield/dab_pdfs/Keller%20et%20al%202005%20Neurology%2064%201152-1156.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased oxidative damage has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases, mild [[cognitive impairment]] and individual differences in cognition in healthy elderly people.  In 'normal aging', the brain is undergoing oxidative stress in a multitude of ways.  The main contributors include protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation and oxidative modifications in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA.&lt;ref name="Keller 2005"/&gt;  Oxidative stress can damage DNA replication and inhibit repair through many complex processes, including [[telomere]] shortening in DNA components.&lt;ref name="Harris 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harris SE, Deary IJ, MacIntyre A |title=The association between telomere length, physical health, cognitive ageing, and mortality in non-demented older people |journal=Neurosci. Lett. |volume=406 |issue=3 |pages=260–4 |date=October 2006 |pmid=16919874 |doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2006.07.055|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each time a [[somatic cell]] replicates, the telomeric DNA component shortens.  As telomere length is partly inheritable,&lt;ref name="Harris 2006"/&gt; there are individual differences in the age of onset of cognitive decline.

===DNA damage===
At least 25 studies have demonstrated that [[DNA repair#DNA damage|DNA damage]] accumulates with age in the mammalian brain.  This DNA damage includes the oxidized nucleoside 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), single- and double-strand breaks, DNA-protein crosslinks and malondialdehyde adducts (reviewed in Bernstein et al.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H, Payne CM, Bernstein C, Garewal H, Dvorak K. (2008) Cancer and aging as consequences of un-repaired DNA damage. In: ''New Research on DNA Damage'' (Editors: Honoka Kimura And Aoi Suzuki) [[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]], New York, Chapter 1, pp. 1-47. see pg. 18. {{ISBN|978-1-60456-581-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Increasing DNA damage with age has been reported in the brains of the mouse, rat, gerbil, rabbit, dog, and human.  Young 4-day-old rats have about 3,000 single-strand breaks and 156 double-strand breaks per neuron, whereas in rats older than 2 years the level of damage increases to about 7,400 single-strand breaks and 600 double-strand breaks per neuron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mandavilli BS, Rao KS | year = 1996 | title = Accumulation of DNA damage in aging neurons occurs through a mechanism other than apoptosis | url = | journal = J Neurochem | volume = 67 | issue = 4| pages = 1559–65 | pmid = 8858940 | doi = 10.1046/j.1471-4159.1996.67041559.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lu et al.&lt;ref name="Lu 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lu T, Pan Y, Kao SY, Li C, Kohane I, Chan J, Yankner BA | year = 2004 | title = Gene regulation and DNA damage in the ageing human brain | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 429 | issue = 6994| pages = 883–891 | doi = 10.1038/nature02661 | pmid = 15190254 }}&lt;/ref&gt; studied the transcriptional profiles of the human frontal cortex of individuals ranging from 26 to 106 years of age. This led to the identification of a set of genes whose expression was altered after age 40.  They further found that the promoter sequences of these particular genes accumulated oxidative DNA damage, including 8-OHdG, with age (see [[DNA damage theory of aging]]).  They concluded that DNA damage may reduce the expression of selectively vulnerable genes involved in learning, memory and neuronal survival, initiating a pattern of brain aging that starts early in life.

== Chemical changes ==
In addition to the structural changes that the brain incurs with age, the aging process also entails a broad range of biochemical changes. More specifically, neurons communicate with each other via specialized chemical messengers called [[neurotransmitter]]s. Several studies have identified a number of these neurotransmitters, as well as their [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], that exhibit a marked alteration in different regions of the brain as part of the normal aging process.

=== Dopamine ===

===Serotonin===
Decreasing levels of different [[serotonin]] receptors and the [[serotonin transporter]], 5-HTT, have also been shown to occur with age. Studies conducted using PET methods on humans, in vivo, show that levels of the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor in the caudate nucleus, putamen, and frontal cerebral cortex, decline with age.&lt;ref name="Wong 1984"/&gt;  A decreased binding capacity of the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor in the frontal cortex was also found,&lt;ref name="Iyo 1993"/&gt; as well as a decreased binding capacity of the serotonin transporter, 5-HHT, in the thalamus and the midbrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yamamoto |first=M. |last2=Suhara |first2=T. |last3=Okubo |first3=Y. |last4=Ichimiya |first4=T. |last5=Sudo |first5=Y. |last6=Inoue |first6=Y. |last7=Takano |first7=A. |last8=Yasuno |first8=F. |last9=Yoshikawa |first9=K. |last10=Tanada |first10=S. |year=2001 |title=Age-related decline of serotonin transporters in living human brain of healthy males |journal=Life Sciences |volume=71 |issue= 7|pages=751–757 |doi= 10.1016/S0024-3205(02)01745-9|pmid=12074934 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Postmortem studies on humans have indicated decreased binding capacities of serotonin and a decrease in the number of S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the frontal cortex and hippocampus as well as a decrease in affinity in the putamen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marcusson |first=J. |last2=Oreland |first2=L. |last3=Winblad |first3=B. |year=1984 |title=Effect of age on human brain serotonin (S-1) binding sites |journal=[[Journal of Neurochemistry]] |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1699–1705 |pmid=6491674 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-4159.1984.tb06098.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glutamate===

==Neuropsychological changes==

===Changes in orientation===
[[Orientation (mental)|Orientation]] is defined as the awareness of self in relation to one's surroundings&lt;ref name="Lezak"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lezak |first=M.D |last2=Howieson |first2=D.B. |last3=Loring |first3=D.W. |year=2004 |title=Neuropsychological Assessment |edition=4th |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-511121-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often orientation is examined by distinguishing whether a person has a sense of time, place, and person. Deficits in orientation are one of the most common symptoms of brain disease, hence tests of orientation are included in almost all medical and neuropsychological evaluations.&lt;ref name="Alverzo 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author =Alverzo JP |title=A review of the literature on orientation as an indicator of level of consciousness |journal=J Nurs Scholarsh |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=159–164 |year=2006 |pmid=16773920 |doi=10.1111/j.1547-5069.2006.00094.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; While research has primarily focused on levels of orientation among clinical populations, a small number of studies have examined whether there is a normal decline in orientation among healthy aging adults.  Results have been somewhat inconclusive. Some studies suggest that orientation does not decline over the lifespan.&lt;ref name="Brotchie"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brotchie |first=J. |last2=Brennan |first2=J.|last3=Wyke |first3=M.|year=1985 |title=Temporal orientation in the presenium and old age. |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=147 |pages=692–695 |doi=10.1192/bjp.147.6.692}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hopp"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hopp |first=G.A. |last2=Dixon |first2=R.A. |last3=Grut |first3=M. |last4=Bacekman |first4=L. |year=1997 |title=Longitudinal and psychometric profiles of two cognitive status tests in very old adults. |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology |volume=53 |pages=673–686 |doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4679(199711)53:7&lt;673::aid-jclp5&gt;3.0.co;2-j}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in one study 92% of normal elderly adults (65–84 years) presented with perfect or near perfect orientation.&lt;ref name="Benton"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Benton |first=A.L. |last2=Eslinger |first2=P. |last3=Damasio |first3=A. |year=1981 |title=Normative observations on neuropsychological test performances in old age. |journal=Journal of Clinical Neuropsychology |volume=3 |pages=33–42 |doi=10.1080/01688638108403111}}&lt;/ref&gt; However some data suggest that mild changes in orientation may be a normal part of aging.&lt;ref name="Ishizaki"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ishizaki |first=J. |last2=Meguro |first2=K. |last3=Ambo |first3=H. |last4=Shimada |first4=M. |last5=Yamaguchi |first5=S. |last6=Harasaka |first6=C. |year=1998 |title=A normative community based study of mini-mental state in elderly adults: The effect of age and educational level. |journal=Journal of Gerontology |volume=53 |pages=359–363 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweet"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sweet |first=J.J. |last2=Such |first2=Y. |last3=Leahy |first3=B. |last4=Abramowitz |first4 = C. |last5=Nowinski |first5=C.J. |year=1999 |title=Normative clinical relationships between orientation and memory: Age as an important moderator variable. |journal=The Clinical Neuropsychologist. |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=495–508 |doi=10.1076/1385-4046(199911)13:04;1-y;ft495}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Sweet and colleagues concluded that "older persons with normal, healthy memory may have mild orientation difficulties. In contrast, younger people with normal memory have virtually no orientation problems"&lt;ref name="Sweet"/&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;505). So although current research suggests that normal aging is not usually associated with significant declines in orientation, mild difficulties may be a part of normal aging and not necessarily a sign of pathology.

===Changes in attention===
Many older adults notice a decline in their attentional abilities.&lt;ref name="Kensinger"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kensinger |first=E.A |year=2009 |title=Cognition in aging and age related disease. In P. R. Hof &amp; C. V. Mobbs (Eds.), Handbook of the neuroscience of aging (249-256). |location=London |publisher=Elsevier Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attention is a broad construct that refers to "the cognitive ability that allows us to deal with the inherent processing limitations of the human brain by selecting information for further processing" (p.&amp;nbsp;334).&lt;ref name="Banich"&gt;{{cite book |last=Banich |first=M. T. |last2=Compton |first2=R. J. |year=2011 |title=Cognitive neuroscience |location=Belmont, CA |publisher= Wadsworth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the human brain has limited resources, people use their attention to zone in on specific stimuli and block out others.

If older adults have fewer attentional resources than younger adults, we would expect that when two tasks must be carried out at the same time, older adults' performance will decline more than that of younger adults. However, a large review of studies on cognition and aging suggest that this hypothesis has not been wholly supported.&lt;ref name="Light"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Light |first=L.L. |year=1991 |title=Memory and aging: Four hypotheses in search of data |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=42 |pages=333–376 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ps.42.020191.002001 |pmid=2018397}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some studies have found that older adults have a more difficult time encoding and retrieving information when their attention is divided, other studies have not found meaningful differences from younger adults. Similarly, one might expect older adults to do poorly on tasks of sustained attention, which measure the ability to attend to and respond to stimuli for an extended period of time. However, studies suggest that sustained attention shows no decline with age. Results suggest that sustained attention increases in early adulthood and then remains relatively stable, at least through the seventh decade of life.&lt;ref name="Carriere"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carrier |first=J. S. A. |last2=Cheyne |first2=A. |last3=Solman |first3=G. J. F. |last4=Smilek |first4=D. |year=2010 |title=Age trends for failures of sustained attention |journal=Psychology and Aging |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=569–574| doi=10.1037/a0019363 | PMID=20677878}}&lt;/ref&gt; More research is needed on how normal aging impacts attention after age eighty.

It is worth noting that there are factors other than true attentional abilities that might relate to difficulty paying attention. For example, it is possible that sensory deficits impact older adults' attentional abilities. In other words, impaired hearing or vision may make it more difficult for older adults to do well on tasks of visual and verbal attention.&lt;ref name="Kensinger"/&gt;

=== Changes in memory ===
{{Main|Memory and aging}}
Many different types of memory have been identified in humans, such as [[declarative memory]] (including [[episodic memory]] and [[semantic memory]]), [[working memory]], [[spatial memory]], and [[procedural memory]].&lt;ref name="Craic"/&gt; Studies done, have found that memory functions, more specifically those associated with the [[medial temporal lobe]] are especially vulnerable to age-related decline.&lt;ref name="Hof 2004"/&gt; A number of studies utilizing a variety of methods such as [[histological]], structural imaging, [[functional imaging]], and [[receptor binding]] have supplied converging evidence that the [[frontal lobe]]s and frontal-striatal dopaminergic pathways are especially affected by age-related processes resulting in memory changes.&lt;ref name="Craic"/&gt;

=== Changes in language ===
Changes in performance on verbal tasks, as well as the location, extent, and signal intensity of [[Blood-oxygen-level dependent imaging|BOLD]] signal changes measured with functional MRI, vary in predictable patterns with age.  For example, behavioral changes associated with age include compromised performance on tasks related to word retrieval, comprehension of sentences with high syntactic and/or working memory demands, and production of such sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Crosson, B., Garcia, A., Mcgregor, K., &amp; Wierenga, C. E. (2013). The Impact of Aging on Neural Systems for Language. In M. F. G. Sandra Koffler, Joel Morgan, Ida Sue Baron (Ed.), Neuropsychology, Volume 1 (pp. 149–187). Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic changes ==
Variation in the effects of aging among individuals can be attributed to both genetic and environmental factors. As in so many other science disciplines, the [[Nature and nurture| nature and nurture debate]] is an ongoing conflict in the field of [[cognitive neuroscience]].&lt;ref name="Gabrieli"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderton 2002"/&gt; The search for genetic factors has always been an important aspect in trying to understand neuro-pathological processes. Research focused on discovering the genetic component in developing AD has also contributed greatly to the understanding the genetics behind normal or "non-pathological" aging.&lt;ref name="Anderton 2002"/&gt;

The human brain shows a decline in function and a change in [[gene expression]]. This modulation in gene expression may be due to [[oxidative]] [[DNA damage]] at [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] regions in the genome.&lt;ref name="Lu 2004"/&gt;  Genes that are down-regulated over the age of 40 include:

* GluR1 [[AMPA receptor]] [[Protein subunit|subunit]]
* [[NMDA receptor|NMDA]] [[NR2A|R2A]] receptor subunit (involved in [[memory|learning]])
* Subunits of the [[GABA A receptor|GABA-A receptor]]
* Genes involved in [[long-term potentiation]] e.g. [[calmodulin]] 1 and [[Protein kinase#Ca2.2B.2Fcalmodulin-dependent protein kinases|CAM kinase II]] alpha.
* Calcium signaling genes
* Synaptic plasticity genes
* Synaptic vesicle release and recycling genes

Genes that are upregulated include:

* Genes associated with [[stress response]] and [[DNA repair]]
* [[Antioxidant]] defence

==Epigenetic age analysis of different brain regions==
The [[cerebellum]] is the youngest brain region (and probably body part) in centenarians according to an epigenetic biomarker of tissue age known as [[Biological clock (aging)|epigenetic clock]]: it is about 15 years younger than expected in a centenarian.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015cerebellum"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = The cerebellum ages slowly according to the epigenetic clock. | journal = [[Age (Albany US)]]| volume = 7 | year = 2015| url = http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v7/n5/pdf/100742.pdf | pmid = 26000617  |pmc= 4468311|vauthors=Horvath S, Mah V, Lu AT, Woo JS, Choi OW, Jasinska AJ, Riancho JA, Tung S, Coles NS, Braun J, Vinters HV, Coles LS | issue = 5 | doi=10.18632/aging.100742 | pages=294–306}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, all brain regions and brain cells appear to have roughly the same epigenetic age in subjects who are younger than 80.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015cerebellum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Horvath S | title=DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types | journal=[[Genome Biology]]  | volume=14 | issue=10 | year=2013 | pages=R115  | url = http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/r115  | pmc = 4015143 |pmid=24138928 | doi=10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings suggest that the cerebellum is protected from aging effects, which in turn could explain why the cerebellum exhibits fewer neuropathological hallmarks of age related dementias compared to other brain regions.

==Delaying the effects of aging==
The process of aging may be inevitable; however, one may potentially delay the effects and severity of this progression.
While there is no consensus of efficacy, the following are reported as delaying cognitive decline:

* Maintaining a healthy diet, including [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s, and protective antioxidants.&lt;ref name="Gabrieli"/&gt;

==="Super Agers"===

Longitudinal research studies have recently conducted genetic analyses of [[centenarian]]s and their offspring to identify biomarkers as protective factors against the negative effects of aging. In particular, the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene is linked to prevention of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sanders |first=Amy |last2=Wang |first2=Cuiling |last3=Katz |first3=Mindy |last4=Derby |first4=Carol |last5=Barzilai |first5=Nir |year=2011 |title= Association of a functional polymorphism in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene with memory decline and incidence of dementia |journal= Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=303 |issue=2 |pages=150–158 |doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1988 |pmid=20068209|pmc=3047443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, valine CETP homozygotes but not heterozygotes experienced a relative 51% less decline in memory compared to a reference group after adjusting for demographic factors and APOE status.

===Cognitive reserve===
{{Main|Cognitive reserve}}

The ability of an individual to demonstrate no cognitive signs of aging despite an aging brain is called cognitive reserve.&lt;ref name="Whalley 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scarmeas 2003"/&gt; This hypothesis suggests that two patients might have the same brain pathology, with one person experiencing noticeable clinical symptoms, while the other continues to function relatively normally.  Studies of cognitive reserve explore the specific biological, genetic and environmental differences which make one person susceptible to cognitive decline, and allow another to age more gracefully.

===Nun Study===
{{Main|Nun Study}}
A study funded by the National Institute of Aging followed a group of 678 Roman Catholic sisters and recorded the effects of aging. The researchers used autobiographical essays collected as the nuns joined their Sisterhood. Findings suggest that early idea density, defined by number of ideas expressed and use of complex prepositions in these essays, was a significant predictor of lower risk for developing Alzheimer's disease in old age.  Lower idea density was found to be significantly associated with lower brain weight, higher brain atrophy, and more neurofibrillary tangles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Riley KP, Snowdon DA, Desrosiers MF, Markesbery WR | year = 2005 | title = Early life linguistic ability, late life cognitive function, and neuropathology: Findings from the Nun Study | url = | journal = Neurobiology of Aging | volume = 26 | issue = 3| page = 341347 | doi=10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2004.06.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypothalamus inflammation and GnRH===

In a recent study (published May 1, 2013), it is suggested that the inflammation of the hypothalamus may be connected to our overall aging bodies. They focused on the activation of the protein complex [[NF-κB]] in mice test subjects, which showed increased activation as mice test subjects aged in the study. This activation not only affects aging, but affects a hormone known as [[GnRH]], which has shown new anti-aging properties when injected into mice outside the hypothalamus, while causing the opposite effect when injected into the hypothalamus. It'll be some time before this can be applied to humans in a meaningful way, as more studies on this pathway are necessary to understand the mechanics of GnRH's anti-aging properties.&lt;ref name="Zhang 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhang Guo |first=Guo |last2=Li |first2=Juxue |last3=Purkayastha |first3=Purkayastha |last4=Tang |first4=Yizhe |last5=Zhang |first5=Hai |last6=Yin |first6=Ye |last7=Li |first7=Bo |year=2013 |title= Hypothalamic programming of systemic ageing involving IKK-[bgr], NF-[kgr]B and GnRH |journal= Nature |doi=10.1038/nature12143 |url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature12143.html |volume=497 |pages=211–216|display-authors=etal |pmid=23636330 |pmc=3756938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11192">An '''analog ear''' or '''analog cochlea''' is a model of the [[ear]] or of the [[cochlea]] (in the [[inner ear]]) based on an electrical, electronic or mechanical [[Analogue electronics|analog]].  An analog ear is commonly described as an interconnection of [[electrical element]]s such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, and [[inductor]]s; sometimes [[transformer]]s and active [[amplifier]]s are included.

==Ear background==
[[File:Anatomy of the Human Ear en.svg|thumb|300px|Anatomy of the human ear. (The length of the auditory canal is exaggerated for viewing purposes.)]]
The ear of the typical mammal consists of three parts.  The [[outer ear]] collects sounds like a horn and guides them to the [[eardrum]]. Vibrations of the drum are conveyed to the [[inner ear]] via a system of bones called [[ossicles]].  These leverage the larger motions of the [[eardrum]] to the smaller vibrations of the [[oval window]].  This window connects to the [[cochlea]] which is a long dual channel arrangement consisting of two channels separated by the [[basilar membrane]]. The structure, about 36&amp;nbsp;mm in length, is coiled to conserve space. The [[oval window]] introduces sounds to the upper channel.  The lower channel has a [[round window]] but this is not driven by the bones of the middle ear.  The far end of the structure has a hole between the two channels called the [[helicotrema]] that equalizes slowly varying pressures in the two channels.  A series of sensory [[hair cells]] along the [[basilar membrane]] respond to send neural pulses towards the brain.

==Ear modeling==

Models for the ear of a direct kind have been created, most notably by Nobel Laureate [[Georg von Békésy]].  He used glass slides, razor blades, and an elastic membrane to represent the [[helicotrema]].  He could measure vibrations along the [[basilar membrane]] in response to different excitations frequencies.  He found that the pattern of displacements for given frequency sine wave along the [[basilar membrane]] rose somewhat gradually to a peak and thereafter fell.  High frequencies favored shorter distances from the [[oval window]] than did lower ones. Frequency values approximate a logarithmic distribution with distance. &lt;ref&gt;Detailed discussions of the direct models by [[von Békésy]] will be found in his book, "Experiments in Hearing", McGraw-Hill, 1960. Also see his article and others in S. S. Stevens, "Handbook of Experimental Psychology", John Wiley and Sons, 1951.  This handbook is singled out as a major source of information on speech and hearing, word recognition, and other topics as well as data on the human ear.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical and electrical analogs==

Early mechanical and electrical analog ears were recounted in the 1954 book ''Analog Methods in Computation and Simulation'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Analog Methods in Computation and Simulation | author = Walter W. Soroka | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1954 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WHlQAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22analog+ear%22+inauthor:soroka&amp;dq=%22analog+ear%22+inauthor:soroka&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=cEhoSNDvNabUswP5xOy5Bg&amp;pgis=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...Barton and Browning&lt;ref&gt;E. M. Barton and H. M. Browning, "The Resonance Theory of Audition Subjected to Experiments," ''Phil. Mag. '' (6) '''38''':164–173 (1919).&lt;/ref&gt; also simulated the characteristics of hearing over the range of an octave by making use of 13 pendulum resonators.  A modern theory of the dynamics of the cochlea, accounting for the hydrodynamics of the cochlear ducts and the dynamics of the basilar membrane, has been proposed&lt;ref&gt;L. C. Peterson and B. P. Bogert, "A Dynamical Theory of the Cochlea," ''J. Acoust. Soc. Amer.,'' '''22''':369–381 (1950).&lt;/ref&gt; and an electrical analogy developed&lt;ref&gt;B. P. Bogert, "A Network to Represent the Inner Ear," ''Bell Labs. Record,'' '''28''':481–485 (1950).&lt;/ref&gt; to check the theory.  The "analog ear" is a transmission line made up of 175 section s, each section consisting of 2 inductances (to represent the mass of a slice of fluid and that of the duct) and 4 condensers (to represent duct stiffness).|Walter W. Soroka}}

A direct (mechanical) model uses the variables of air and water pressure, fluid velocity and viscosity, and displacement.  An electrical analog model uses a different set of variables, namely, voltage and current. The outer and middle parts of the ear can be represented with a collection of coils, capacitors, and an ideal transformer to represent the leveraging effect of the [[ossicles]]. This circuit terminates with a capacitor representing the [[oval window]].  From there, the two channels are represented with a sequence of inductors and resistors for fluid flow within each channel with the two channels joined with a sequence of series resonant RLC circuits.  Voltages across capacitances represent [[basilar membrane]] displacements. Element values along the cochlea are tapered in a logarithmic fashion to represent lowering frequency responses with distance.

The pattern of voltages along the [[basilar membrane]] can be viewed on an oscilloscope. Average values can be obtained with rectification and shown as patterns using a high speed commutator. The analog ear shows patterns that closely follow those observed by [[Georg von Békésy]] on his more direct model.

The first relatively complete model was constructed in the early 1960s at the University of Arizona by two graduate students and their faculty mentor with support from the newly established Air Force [[Bionics]] program. This work was first summarized in a report: "An Electronic Analog of the Ear", Technical Documentary Report No. [[Armored Medical Research Laboratory|AMRL]]-[[Technical documentation|TDR]]-1963-60, June 1963, Biophysics Laboratory, 6570-th Aerospace Medical Research Laboratories, Aerospace Medical Division, Air Force Systems Command, by E. Glaesser, W. F. Caldwell, and J. L. Stewart. The report contains an extensive list of references. The work was also reported at [[Bionics]] symposia.

==John L. Stewart and Covox==

Unlike models based on a series of active filters or represented with digital equations, an analog ear can incorporate nonlinearities that represent nonlinear actions of the [[basilar membrane]], perhaps caused by asymmetric motions of sensory cells resulting in asymmetric motions of the basilar membrane. Difference frequencies could be generated as are observed in the human. Some difference frequencies originating in the [[cochlea]] can be observed in the [[outer ear]].

Neural signals responding to motions of the basilar membrane show responses in one direction as in rectification. At all but low frequencies, the neural measure averages over multiple cycles to give the equivalent of rectification followed by averaging ([[low-pass filter]]ing).  Over the entire cochlea, response shows as a pattern that varies more slowly that the applied frequency but that does follow the envelope of the applied signal.  Each group of cells can give rise to a semi-periodic wave that can be analyzed by neurons in the brain. The total pattern that arises from a sound can thus be thought of as a two-dimensional pattern in time with one axis being the distance along the basilar membrane and the other being distance along some sequence of neurons.  These patterns, varying at rates less than lower audio frequencies, have shapes that can be identified much like patterns in vision.  The concept of the "neural analyzer" as an extension of cochlear patterns is discussed in U. S. patent 3,387,093, "Speech Bandwidth Compression System", June 4, 1968 (filed in 1964).

It was found that the analog ear with its asymmetric overlapping bands was more reliable in identifying speech sounds than is a conventional [[frequency spectrum]]. The second [[formant]] is the most significant single measure. Speech sounds of interest include [[whispered]] and [[clipped speech]].&lt;ref&gt;See "Speech Processing with A Cochlear-Neural Analog, John L. Stewart, 1967, Technical Documentary Report No. [[Armored Medical Research Laboratory|AMRL]]-[[Technical report|TR]]-1966-229.  An article published in the journal ''Behavioral Science'' studied constraints to sensory discrimination imposed by two kinds of neural noise. Considerable information on speech patterns and recognition is reported by a number of different authors in the ''Handbook of Experimental Psychology'' referred to above.&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications were made to animals and insects with appropriate ear models.&lt;ref&gt;See "Aural Systems Simulation for Birds and Insects," Robert L. Lucas, John L. Stewart, and Richard A. Schaeffer. Technical Report AFAL-TR-66-12. January 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study using the analog ear was "Simulating Mechanisms in Animal Echoranging", John L. Stewart and James M. Kasson.&lt;ref&gt;Technical Report [[Armored Medical Research Laboratory|AMRL]]-[[Technical report|TR]]-1968-194. September 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many reports, articles, and patents followed the research as cited in the reports listed here. The last full report employed a relatively early version of a computer program written in time-shared [[BASIC]].&lt;ref&gt;See "A Theory and Physical Model for Cochlear Mechanics", John L. Stewart. Acta Oto-Laryngologica, Supplement 294, 1972.  Parameters of the analog ear and patterns obtained with the computer program are shown.  Patterns and parameters given in this report are sufficient to reproduce analog ears.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart also self-published several books, doing business as Santa Rita Technology, and later as Covox, including ''The Analog Ear Story'' and ''The Analog Ear–brain System'' in 1964, and ''The Bionic Ear'' in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?q=inauthor%3Ajohn+inauthor%3Astewart+intitle%3Aear&lt;/ref&gt;

The research resulting from analog ear studies fueled the creation of special sounds for use in repelling birds and other pests. Sounds were synthesized to follow natural bird calls but were of a switching kind. The concept is similar to the use of a babble of human voices for jamming another person's communications. The "Av-Alarm" was the principal product. It was also adapted to the transonic and ultrasonic regions with a device called "Transonic".

The research also led to development of an early speech word recognizer that operated with 8-bit computers as well as later ones based on 16-bit processors. The product line was developed by Covox, Inc. with product names of "Speech Thing" and "Voice Master". 

A number of U.S. (and foreign) patents on topics related to Stewart's analog ear were granted. In the order of filing dates starting in 1962, numbers are 3,294,909, 3,325,597, 3,387,093, 3,432,618, 3,378,700, 3,483,325, 3,459,034, 3,543,138, and 3,510,588.

== Inventory of the animals ==
The ship had her own [[Ship's cat|official cat]] named Jenny, who was kept aboard ''Titanic'' as a mascot and also worked to keep down the ship's population of rats and mice. Transferred over from ''Titanic''{{'}}s sister ship ''[[RMS Olympic|Olympic]]'', Jenny gave birth in the week before ''Titanic'' sailed from [[Southampton]]. She normally lived in the galley, where the victualling staff fed her and her kittens on scraps from the kitchens.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1999|p=234}} Stewardess [[Violet Jessop]] wrote that the cat "laid her family near Jim, the scullion, whose approval she always sought and who always gave her warm devotion".{{sfn|Pellegrino|2012|p=29}}

A number of dogs were brought aboard by passengers as pets. Most were kept in kennels on the ship's F Deck, though some First Class passengers kept theirs in their cabins&amp;nbsp;– probably without the knowledge of the crew or with the turning of a blind eye, as they were not supposed to do so. The ship's carpenter, John Hutchison, was responsible for the dogs' welfare. The kennel dogs were exercised daily on the [[poop deck]] by a steward or one of the bellboys.{{sfn|Georgiou|2000|p=18}} As for the lapdogs, the American painter [[Francis Davis Millet]] wrote disapprovingly in a letter sent from ''Titanic''{{'}}s last stop, [[Cobh|Queenstown]] in Ireland, "Looking over the [passenger] list I only find three or four people I know but there are ... a number of obnoxious, ostentatious American women, the scourge of any place they infest, and worse on shipboard than anywhere. Many of them carry tiny dogs, and lead husbands around like pet lambs".{{sfn|Davenport-Hines|2012|p=174}} The dog owners had planned to hold a dog show aboard the ship on the morning of 15 April,{{sfn|Lynch|1992|p=100}} but the ''Titanic'' would sink the preceding night.
[[File:Madeleine JackAstor.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The Astors with their Airedale, "Kitty"]]
The details of several of the dogs aboard ''Titanic'' were recorded and included:
* A [[King Charles Spaniel]] and an elderly [[Airedale Terrier]], owned by William Carter.
* Chow-Chow, a [[chow chow]] owned by Harry Anderson.
* A champion [[French Bulldog]] called Gamin de Pycombe, owned by [[Robert Williams Daniel]], who had bought him in England for the very high price of £150 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|150|1912|2015}}}} in 2015 prices).
* Kitty, another Airedale Terrier, owned by millionaire [[John Jacob Astor IV|John Jacob Astor]].
* A [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian]] owned by [[Margaret Bechstein Hays]], named Bebe, which she kept (probably surreptitiously) in her cabin.
* A dog owned by Elizabeth Rothschild, also kept in her cabin.
* A [[Pekingese]] called Sun Yat Sen, owned by Henry Sleeper Harper and his wife Myra.
* Frou-Frou, a [[toy dog]] owned by Helen Bishop. The dog was allowed to stay in her cabin as the stewards considered it "too pretty" to put among the bigger dogs in the kennels.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1999|p=234}}

There were probably more dogs aboard, but their details (and owners) have not survived. Passenger Charles Moore of Washington, D.C. made a last-minute change to his plans to transport aboard ''Titanic'' 100 English [[foxhound]]s, which he intended to use to start an English-style [[fox hunt]] in the Washington area. They were instead shipped aboard another vessel.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1999|p=234}}

As well as the dogs and cats, there were a number of birds aboard. [[Ella Holmes White]] of New York brought four roosters and hens, which were probably kept in or near the F Deck dog kennels. She had imported them from France with the intention of improving her poultry stock at home. Another woman was said to have brought 30 cockerels aboard and Elizabeth Ramel Nye brought her yellow canary. Two dogs and a canary disembarked with the passengers who left the ship at [[Cherbourg]], ''Titanic''{{'}}s first port of call after Southampton. The animals travelled on their own tickets and even the canary that left at Cherbourg had to be paid for, to the tune of 25 US cents.{{sfn|Georgiou|2000|p=18}}

Like any other ship of the time, ''Titanic'' had a substantial population of rats. One was seen running across the Third Class Dining Room on the evening of the sinking, to the shock and amazement of the diners. Some of the women who saw it burst into tears, while men tried unsuccessfully to capture the rat.{{sfn|Georgiou|2000|p=18}}

== Fate of the animals ==
Few of ''Titanic''{{'}}s animals survived the ship's sinking. Three of the dogs were taken aboard [[Lifeboats of the RMS Titanic|lifeboats]] by their owners. Margaret Hays' Pomeranian got away safely in Lifeboat 7 and lived until June 1917 when it ran away or was stolen, while Elizabeth Rothschild refused to board Lifeboat 6 unless her dog was allowed to come too. Henry and Myra Harper brought their Pekingese aboard Lifeboat 3, but Helen Bishop had to abandon Frou-Frou in her cabin, much to their mutual distress.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1999|p=234}} The dog attempted to stop her leaving by holding on to her dress with his teeth until the seam tore. Afterwards, Bishop spoke of her sorrow: "The loss of my little dog hurt me very much. I will never forget how he dragged on my clothes. He so wanted to accompany me".{{sfn|Georgiou|2000|p=18}}

None of the other animals survived. At some point during the sinking, someone decided to free the dogs from their kennels, leading to a pack of excited dogs racing up and down the slanting deck as the ship went down. One female passenger is said to have refused to be parted from her dog and chose to stay aboard. Several days later, as the SS ''Bremen'' passed through an area still strewn with debris and bodies floating in the water, a single passenger saw the body of what she thought was a woman tightly holding what could have been a large shaggy dog in her arms.{{sfn|Georgiou|2000|p=18}} Robert W. Daniel's bulldog Gamin de Pycombe was last seen in the water swimming for his life after the ship went down.{{sfn|Davenport-Hines|2012|p=174}}

After the sinking, several of the surviving animal owners made compensation claims for their lost pets and poultry. Daniel claimed $750 for the loss of his pedigree bulldog, while Carter claimed $300 for the loss of his two dogs. White claimed $207.87 for her lost chickens and Chow-Chow was valued by Anderson at $50. Only three out of twelve dogs survived the sinking.{{sfn|Georgiou|2000|p=18}}

A '''referendum on the [[death penalty]]''' for [[premeditated murder]] was held in [[Bermuda]] on 12 August 1990.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=bm011990 Bermuda, 12 August 1990: Retention/abolition of the death penalty] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum was held following pressure from the [[United Kingdom|British]] government, and was held as part of the Capital Punishment Referendum Act, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonlii.org/bm/legis/consol_act/cpra1989304/ Capital Punishment Referendum Act 1989] Bermuda Consolidated Legislation&lt;/ref&gt; However, voters approved of retaining the penalty, with 79% voting in favour. 

The death penalty was later abolished by the [[Parliament of Bermuda]] following a vote in December 1999.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

In [[biology]], a '''biological life cycle''' (or just '''life cycle''' when the biological context is clear) is a series of changes in form that an organism undergoes, returning to the starting state. "The concept is closely related to those of the life history, [[Developmental biology|development]] and [[ontogeny]], but differs from them in stressing renewal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/55494?uid=3739448&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103764585297 |author1=Graham Bell  |author2=Vassiliki Koufopanou  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The architecture of the life cycle in small organisms |journal=Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences |year=1991 |volume=332 |issue=1262 |pages=81–89 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1991.0035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transitions of form may involve growth, [[asexual reproduction]], or [[sexual reproduction]].

In some organisms, different "generations" of the species succeed each other during the life cycle. For [[Embryophyte|plants]] and many [[algae]], there are two multicellular stages, and the life cycle is referred to as [[alternation of generations]]. The term '''life history''' is often used, particularly for organisms such as the [[red algae]] which have three multicellular stages (or more), rather than two.&lt;ref name="Dixon73"&gt;Dixon, P.S. 1973. ''Biology of the Rhodophyta.'' Oliver &amp; Boyd. {{ISBN|0 05 002485 X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life cycles that include sexual reproduction involve alternating [[haploid]] (''n'') and [[diploid]] (2''n'') stages, i.e., a change of [[ploidy]] is involved. To return from a diploid stage to a haploid stage, [[meiosis]] must occur. In regard to changes of [[ploidy]], there are 3 types of cycles:
*'''''haplontic''''' life cycle — the haploid stage is multicellular and the diploid stage is a single cell, meiosis is "zygotic".
*'''''diplontic''''' life cycle — the diploid stage is multicellular and haploid [[gamete]]s are formed, meiosis is "gametic".
*'''''haplodiplontic''''' life cycle (also referred to as ''diplohaplontic'', ''diplobiontic'', or ''dibiontic'' life cycle) — multicellular diploid and haploid stages occur, meiosis is "sporic".

The cycles differ in when [[mitosis]] (growth) occurs. '''Zygotic meiosis''' and '''gametic meiosis''' have one mitotic stage: mitosis occurs during the ''n'' phase in zygotic meiosis and during the 2''n'' phase in gametic meiosis. Therefore, zygotic and gametic meiosis are collectively termed '''haplobiontic''' (single mitotic phase, not to be confused with haplontic). '''Sporic meiosis''', on the other hand, has mitosis in two stages, both the diploid and haploid stages, termed '''diplobiontic''' (not to be confused with diplontic).

==Discovery==
The study of [[reproduction]] and [[Embryogenesis|development]] in organisms was carried out by many botanists and zoologists.

[[Wilhelm Hofmeister]] demonstrated that [[alternation of generations]] is a feature that unites plants, and published this result in 1851 (see [[History of botany#Plant sexuality|plant sexuality]]).

Some terms (haplobiont and diplobiont) used for the description of life cycles were proposed initially for algae by Nils Svedelius, and then became used for other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Nils Eberhard Svedelius. 1873-1960 | author=C.

''Encyclopedia of Microbiology''. Academic Press. Volume 4, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haplontic life cycle==
[[File:Haploid English.svg|thumb|250px|Zygotic meiosis]]
A '''zygotic meiosis''' is a [[meiosis]] of a [[zygote]] immediately after [[karyogamy]], which is the fusion of two [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]]. This way, the organism ends its diploid phase and produces several haploid cells. These cells divide [[mitotic]]ally to form either larger, multicellular individuals, or more haploid cells. Two opposite types of gametes (e.g., male and female) from these individuals or cells fuse to become a zygote.

In the whole cycle, zygotes are the only diploid cell; mitosis occurs only in the haploid phase.

The individuals or cells as a result of mitosis are '''haplonts''', hence this life cycle is also called '''haplontic life cycle'''. Haplonts are:

Cambridge University Press (623 pp).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplontic life cycle==
[[File:Diploid English.svg|thumb|250px|Gametic meiosis]]

In '''gametic meiosis''', instead of immediately dividing ''meiotically'' to produce haploid cells, the zygote divides ''mitotically'' to produce a multicellular diploid individual or a group of more unicellular diploid cells. Cells from the diploid individuals then undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells or [[gamete]]s. Haploid cells may divide again (by mitosis) to form more haploid cells, as in many yeasts, but the haploid phase is not the predominant life cycle phase. In most diplonts, mitosis occurs only in the diploid phase, i.e. gametes usually form quickly and fuse to produce diploid zygotes.

In the whole cycle, gametes are usually the only haploid cells, and mitosis usually occurs only in the diploid phase.

The diploid multicellular individual is a '''diplont''', hence a gametic meiosis is also called a '''diplontic life cycle'''. Diplonts are:

* In [[archaeplastida]]ns: some [[green algae]] (e.g., ''[[Cladophora|Cladophora glomerata]]'',&lt;ref&gt;O. P. Sharma. Textbook of Algae, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Acetabularia]]''&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;)
* In [[stramenopiles]]: some [[brown algae]] (the [[Fucales]], however, their life cycle can also be interpreted as strongly heteromorphic-diplohaplontic, with a highly reduced gametophyte phase, as in the [[flowering plants]]),&lt;ref&gt;van den Hoek, C. et al. (1995), p. 207, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xuUoiFesSHMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;pg=PA207#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt; some [[xanthophyte]]s (e.g., ''[[Vaucheria]]''),&lt;ref&gt;van den Hoek,  C. et al.

==Haplodiplontic life cycle==
[[File:Diplohaplontic English.svg|thumb|250px|Sporic meiosis]]
{{Main|Alternation of generations}}
In '''sporic meiosis''' (also commonly known as '''intermediary meiosis'''), the zygote divides mitotically to produce a multicellular diploid [[sporophyte]]. The sporophyte creates spores via meiosis which ''also'' then divide mitotically producing haploid individuals called [[gametophyte]]s. The gametophytes produce gametes via mitosis. In some plants the gametophyte is not only small-sized but also short-lived; in other plants and many algae, the gametophyte is the "dominant" stage of the life cycle.

Haplodiplonts are:

* In [[archaeplastida]]ns: [[red algae]] (which have two sporophyte generations), some [[green algae]] (e.g., ''[[Ulva (genus)|Ulva]]''), [[Embryophyte|land plants]]&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;
* In [[stramenopiles]]: most [[brown algae]]&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;
* In [[rhizaria]]ns: many [[foraminiferan]]s,&lt;ref name="Ruppert" /&gt; [[plasmodiophoromycetes]]&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;
* In [[amoebozoa]]: [[myxogastrid]]s
* In [[opisthokont]]s: some [[fungi]] (some [[chytrid]]s, some [[ascomycetes]] like the [[brewer's yeast]])&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;
* Other eukaryotes: [[haptophyte]]s&lt;ref name="Ruppert" /&gt;

Some animals have a [[sex-determination system]] called [[haplodiploid]], but this is not related to the haplodiplontic life cycle.

== Vegetative meiosis ==
Some [[red algae]] (such as ''Bonnemaisonia''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tandf/tejp/2009/00000044/00000003/art00012|title=Somatic meiosis in the life history of Bonnemaisonia asparagoides and Bonnemaisonia clavata (Bonnemaisoniales, Rhodophyta) from the Iberian peninsula|first1=Noemi|last1=Salvador Soler|first2=Amelia|last2=Gomez Garreta|first3=M.|last3=Antonia Ribera Siguan|date=1 August 2009|publisher=|journal=European Journal of Phycology|volume=44|issue=3|pages=381–393|via=IngentaConnect|doi=10.1080/09670260902780782}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Lemanea]]'') and green algae (such as ''[[Prasiola]]'') have '''vegetative meiosis''', also called '''somatic meiosis''', which is a rare phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;van den Hoek, C. et al. (1995), pp. 82, 453.&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetative meiosis can occur in haplodiplontic and also in diplontic life cycles. The gametophytes remain attached to and part of the sporophyte. Vegetative (non-reproductive) diploid cells undergo meiosis, generating vegetative haploid cells. These undergo many mitosis, and produces gametes.

A different phenomenon, called '''vegetative diploidization''', a type of [[apomixis]], occurs in some [[brown alga]]e (e.g., ''Elachista stellaris'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lewis, R.J.|year=1996|title=Chromosomes of the brown algae|journal=Phycologia|volume=35|issue=1|pages=19–40|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2216/i0031-8884-35-1-19.1|doi=10.2216/i0031-8884-35-1-19.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cells in a haploid part of the plant spontaneously duplicate their chromosomes to produce diploid tissue.

==Evolution==
The primitive type of life cycle probably had haploid individuals with asexual reproduction.&lt;ref name="Ruppert" /&gt; [[Bacteria]] and [[archaea]] exhibit a life cycle like this, and some eukaryotes apparently do too (e.g., [[Cryptophyta]], [[Choanoflagellata]], many  [[Euglenozoa]], many [[Amoebozoa]], some red algae, some [[green algae]], the [[imperfect fungi]], some [[rotifer]]s and many other groups, not necessarily haploid).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Heywood, P. |author2=Magee, P.T. |year=1976|title=Meiosis in protists.

'''Biotechnology''' is the broad area of biology involving living systems and organisms to develop or make products, or "any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use" (UN [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], Art. 2).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbd.int/convention/text/ Text of the CBD]. CBD.int. Retrieved on March 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Depending on the tools and applications, it often overlaps with the (related) fields of [[molecular biology]], [[bioengineering|bio-engineering]], [[biomedical engineering]], [[biomanufacturing]], [[molecular engineering]], etc.

For thousands of years, humankind has used biotechnology in [[agriculture]], [[food production]], and [[medicine]].&lt;ref name = BioREACH&gt;[http://www.public.asu.edu/~langland/biotech-intro.html "Incorporating Biotechnology into the Classroom What is Biotechnology?", from the curricula of the 'Incorporating Biotechnology into the High School Classroom through Arizona State University's BioREACH program', accessed on October 16, 2012)]. Public.asu.edu. Retrieved on March 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is largely believed to have been coined in 1919 by Hungarian [[engineer]] [[Károly Ereky]].

The wide concept of "biotech" or "biotechnology" encompasses a wide range of procedures for modifying living organisms according to human purposes, going back to [[domestication]] of animals, cultivation of the plants, and "improvements" to these through breeding programs that employ [[artificial selection]] and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]]. Modern usage also includes [[genetic engineering]] as well as [[cell culture|cell]] and [[tissue culture]] technologies.

==History==
[[File:The Brewer designed and engraved in the Sixteenth. Century by J Amman.png|upright|thumb|[[Brewing]] was an early application of biotechnology]]

{{Main|History of biotechnology}}

Although not normally what first comes to mind, many forms of human-derived [[agriculture]] clearly fit the broad definition of "'utilizing a biotechnological system to make products".  Indeed, the cultivation of plants may be viewed as the earliest biotechnological enterprise.

[[Agriculture]] has been theorized to have become the dominant way of producing food since the [[Neolithic Revolution]].  Through early biotechnology, the earliest farmers selected and bred the best suited crops, having the highest yields, to produce enough food to support a growing population.  As crops and fields became increasingly large and difficult to maintain, it was discovered that specific organisms and their by-products could effectively [[fertilize]], [[nitrogen fixation|restore nitrogen]], and [[pesticide|control pests]]. Throughout the history of agriculture, farmers have inadvertently altered the genetics of their crops through introducing them to new environments and [[plant breeding|breeding]] them with other plants — one of the first forms of biotechnology.

These processes also were included in early [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of [[beer]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book | last = Arnold | first = John P.  | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2005 | title = Origin and History of Beer and Brewing: From Prehistoric Times to the Beginning of Brewing Science and Technology | location = Cleveland, Ohio | publisher = BeerBooks | page = 34 | isbn = 978-0-9662084-1-2 | oclc = 71834130 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; These processes were introduced in early [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]], [[China]] and [[India]], and still use the same basic biological methods.  In [[brewing]], malted grains (containing [[enzymes]]) convert starch from grains into sugar and then adding specific [[yeasts]] to produce beer. In this process, [[carbohydrates]] in the grains broke down into alcohols, such as ethanol. Later, other cultures produced the process of [[lactic acid fermentation]], which produced other preserved foods, such as [[soy sauce]]. Fermentation was also used in this time period to produce [[leavened bread]]. Although the process of fermentation was not fully understood until [[Louis Pasteur]]'s work in 1857, it is still the first use of biotechnology to convert a food source into another form.

Before the time of [[Charles Darwin]]'s work and life, animal and plant scientists had already used selective breeding. Darwin added to that body of work with his scientific observations about the ability of science to change species. These accounts contributed to Darwin's theory of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404200058.html|title = Biotechnology|last = Cole-Turner|first = Ronald | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2003|journal = Encyclopedia of Science and Religion|access-date = December 7, 2014|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For thousands of years, humans have used selective breeding to improve production of crops and livestock to use them for food. In selective breeding, organisms with desirable characteristics are mated to produce offspring with the same characteristics. For example, this technique was used with corn to produce the largest and sweetest crops.&lt;ref name=Thieman&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Thieman WJ, Palladino MA |title=Introduction to Biotechnology |publisher=Pearson/Benjamin Cummings |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-321-49145-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early twentieth century scientists gained a greater understanding of [[microbiology]] and explored ways of manufacturing specific products. In 1917, [[Chaim Weizmann]] first used a pure microbiological culture in an industrial process, that of manufacturing [[corn starch]] using ''[[Clostridium acetobutylicum]],'' to produce [[acetone]], which the [[United Kingdom]] desperately needed to manufacture [[explosive]]s during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Springham_biotechnology"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Springham D, Springham G, Moses V, Cape RE |title=Biotechnology: The Science and the Business |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GY5DCr6LD4C |date=August 24, 1999 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-90-5702-407-8 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biotechnology has also led to the development of antibiotics. In 1928, [[Alexander Fleming]] discovered the mold ''[[Penicillium]]''. His work led to the purification of the antibiotic compound formed by the mold by Howard Florey, Ernst Boris Chain and Norman Heatley – to form what we today know as [[penicillin]]. In 1940, penicillin became available for medicinal use to treat bacterial infections in humans.&lt;ref name=Thieman/&gt;

The field of modern biotechnology is generally thought of as having been born in 1971 when Paul Berg's (Stanford) experiments in gene splicing had early success.  Herbert W. Boyer (Univ. Calif. at San Francisco) and Stanley N. Cohen (Stanford) significantly advanced the new technology in 1972 by transferring genetic material into a bacterium, such that the imported material would be reproduced.  The commercial viability of a biotechnology industry was significantly expanded on June 16, 1980, when the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that a [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] [[microorganism]] could be [[patent]]ed in the case of ''[[Diamond v. Chakrabarty]]''.&lt;ref name="DiamondvChakrabarty"&gt;"[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=447&amp;invol=303 Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980). No. 79-139]."

Retrieved on May 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Indian-born Ananda Chakrabarty, working for [[General Electric]], had modified a bacterium (of the genus ''[[Pseudomonas]]'') capable of breaking down crude oil, which he proposed to use in treating oil spills.  (Chakrabarty's work did not involve gene manipulation but rather the transfer of entire organelles between strains of the ''Pseudomonas'' bacterium.

Revenue in the industry is expected to grow by 12.9% in 2008.{{Update|section|date=October 2018}} Another factor influencing the biotechnology sector's success is improved intellectual property rights legislation—and enforcement—worldwide, as well as strengthened demand for medical and pharmaceutical products to cope with an ageing, and ailing, U.S. population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080402034432/http://www.ibisworld.com/pressrelease/pressrelease.aspx?prid=115 VoIP Providers And Corn Farmers Can Expect To Have Bumper Years In 2008 And Beyond, According To The Latest Research Released By Business Information Analysts At IBISWorld]. Los Angeles (March 19, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rising demand for biofuels is expected to be good news for the biotechnology sector, with the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] estimating [[ethanol]] usage could reduce U.S. petroleum-derived fuel consumption by up to 30% by 2030. The biotechnology sector has allowed the U.S. farming industry to rapidly increase its supply of corn and soybeans—the main inputs into biofuels—by developing genetically modified seeds that resist pests and drought. By increasing farm productivity, biotechnology boosts biofuel production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-technology-1/The-Recession-List---Top-10-Industries-to-Fly-and-Flop-in-2008-4076-3/ The Recession List — Top 10 Industries to Fly and Fl...

Biotechnology has applications in four major industrial areas, including health care (medical), crop production and agriculture, non-food (industrial) uses of crops and other products (e.g. [[biodegradable plastic]]s, [[vegetable oil]], [[biofuel]]s), and environmental uses.

For example, one application of biotechnology is the directed use of [[organism]]s for the manufacture of organic products (examples include [[beer]] and [[milk]] products). Another example is using naturally present [[bacteria]] by the mining industry in [[bioleaching]]. Biotechnology is also used to recycle, treat waste, clean up sites contaminated by industrial activities ([[bioremediation]]), and also to produce [[biological warfare|biological weapons]].

A series of derived terms have been coined to identify several branches of biotechnology, for example:
* [[Bioinformatics]] (also called "gold biotechnology) is an interdisciplinary field that addresses biological problems using computational techniques, and makes the rapid organization as well as analysis of biological data possible. The field may also be referred to as ''computational biology'', and can be defined as, "conceptualizing biology in terms of molecules and then applying informatics techniques to understand and organize the information associated with these molecules, on a large scale."&lt;ref name="gerstein"&gt;Gerstein, M.

* Green biotechnology is biotechnology applied to agricultural processes. An example would be the selection and domestication of plants via [[micropropagation]]. Another example is the designing of [[transgenic plant]]s to grow under specific environments in the presence (or absence) of chemicals. One hope is that green biotechnology might produce more environmentally friendly solutions than traditional [[industrial agriculture]]. An example of this is the engineering of a plant to express a [[pesticide]], thereby ending the need of external application of pesticides. An example of this would be [[Transgenic maize|Bt corn]].

===Medicine===
In medicine, modern biotechnology has many applications in areas such as [[pharmaceutical drug]] discoveries and production, [[pharmacogenomics]], and genetic testing (or genetic screening).
[[File:Microarray2.gif|thumb|[[DNA microarray]] chip – some can do as many as a million blood tests at once ]]

[[Pharmacogenomics]] (a combination of [[pharmacology]] and [[genomics]]) is the technology that analyses how genetic makeup affects an individual's response to drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Ermak G. (2013) ''Modern Science &amp; Future Medicine'' (second edition)&lt;/ref&gt; It deals with the influence of [[genetics|genetic]] variation on drug responses in patients by correlating [[gene expression]] or [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s with a drug's [[efficacy]] or [[toxicity]].&lt;ref name="pmid20836007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang L | title = Pharmacogenomics: a systems approach | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Systems Biology and Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–22 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20836007 | pmc = 3894835 | doi = 10.1002/wsbm.42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By doing so, pharmacogenomics aims to develop rational means to optimize drug therapy, with respect to the patients' [[genotype]], to ensure maximum efficacy with minimal [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]].&lt;ref name="pmid19530963"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Becquemont L | title = Pharmacogenomics of adverse drug reactions: practical applications and perspectives | journal = Pharmacogenomics | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 961–9 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19530963 | doi = 10.2217/pgs.09.37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such approaches promise the advent of "[[personalized medicine]]"; in which drugs and drug combinations are optimized for each individual's unique genetic makeup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126957.pdf|format=PDF|title=Guidance for Industry Pharmacogenomic Data Submissions|date=March 2005|publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]|access-date=August 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20712531"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Squassina A, Manchia M, Manolopoulos VG, Artac M, Lappa-Manakou C, Karkabouna S, Mitropoulos K, Del Zompo M, Patrinos GP | title = Realities and expectations of pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine: impact of translating genetic knowledge into clinical practice | journal = Pharmacogenomics | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 1149–67 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20712531 | doi = 10.2217/pgs.10.97 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biotechnology has contributed to the discovery and manufacturing of traditional [[small molecule]] [[pharmaceutical drugs]] as well as drugs that are the product of biotechnology – [[biopharmaceutics]]. Modern biotechnology can be used to manufacture existing medicines relatively easily and cheaply. The first genetically engineered products were medicines designed to treat human diseases. To cite one example, in 1978 [[Genentech]] developed synthetic humanized [[insulin]] by joining its gene with a [[plasmid]] vector inserted into the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. Insulin, widely used for the treatment of diabetes, was previously extracted from the pancreas of [[abattoir]] animals (cattle or pigs). The resulting genetically engineered bacterium enabled the production of vast quantities of synthetic human insulin at relatively low cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Bains W |title=Genetic Engineering For Almost Everybody: What Does It Do?

[[Genetic testing]] allows the [[Genetics|genetic]] [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of vulnerabilities to inherited [[diseases]], and can also be used to determine a child's parentage (genetic mother and father) or in general a person's [[ancestry]]. In addition to studying [[chromosomes]] to the level of individual genes, genetic testing in a broader sense includes [[biochemical]] tests for the possible presence of genetic diseases, or mutant forms of genes associated with increased risk of developing genetic disorders.  Genetic testing identifies changes in [[chromosomes]], genes, or proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/testing/genetictesting |title=What is genetic testing? – Genetics Home Reference |publisher=Ghr.nlm.nih.gov |date=May 30, 2011 |access-date=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the time, testing is used to find changes that are associated with inherited disorders.

[[Genetically modified food]]s are foods produced from [[organism]]s that have had specific changes introduced into their [[DNA]] with the methods of [[genetic engineering]]. These techniques have allowed for the introduction of new crop traits as well as a far greater control over a food's genetic structure than previously afforded by methods such as [[selective breeding]] and [[mutation breeding]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file15655.pdf GM Science Review First Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016100707/http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file15655.pdf |date=October 16, 2013 }}, Prepared by the UK GM Science Review panel (July 2003).

==={{visible anchor|Industrial|Industrial biotechnology}}===
Industrial biotechnology (known mainly in Europe as white biotechnology) is the application of biotechnology for industrial purposes, including [[industrial fermentation]]. It includes the practice of using [[Cell (biology)|cells]] such as [[micro-organisms]], or components of cells like [[enzyme]]s, to generate [[Industry|industrially]] useful products in sectors such as chemicals, food and feed, detergents, paper and pulp, textiles and [[biofuel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unido.org/fileadmin/media/documents/pdf/Energy_Environment/Industrial_biotech_and_biomass_utilisation_EGM_report.pdf Industrial Biotechnology and Biomass Utilisation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405175248/http://www.unido.org/fileadmin/media/documents/pdf/Energy_Environment/Industrial_biotech_and_biomass_utilisation_EGM_report.pdf |date=April 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the current decades, significant progress has been done in creating [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified organisms (GMOs)]] that enhance the diversity of applications and economical viability of industrial biotechnology. By using renewable raw materials to produce a variety of chemicals and fuels, industrial biotechnology is actively advancing towards lowering greenhouse gas emissions and moving away from a petrochemical-based economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovationeu.org/news/innovation-eu-vol2-1/0262-industrial-biotechnology.html Industrial biotechnology, A powerful, innovative technology to mitigate climate change]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental===

The environment can be affected by biotechnologies, both positively and adversely. Vallero and others have argued that the difference between beneficial biotechnology (e.g.bioremediation is to clean up an oil spill or hazard chemical leak) versus the adverse effects stemming from biotechnological enterprises (e.g. flow of genetic material from transgenic organisms into wild strains) can be seen as applications and implications, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel A. Vallero]], ''Environmental Biotechnology: A Biosystems Approach'', Academic Press, Amsterdam, NV; {{ISBN|978-0-12-375089-1}}; 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Cleaning up environmental wastes is an example of an application of environmental biotechnology; whereas [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] or loss of containment of a harmful microbe are examples of environmental implications of biotechnology.

===Regulation===
{{main|Regulation of genetic engineering|Regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms}}

The regulation of genetic engineering concerns approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the use of [[genetic engineering]] technology, and the development and release of genetically modified organisms (GMO), including [[genetically modified crops]] and [[genetically modified fish]]. There are differences in the regulation of GMOs between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaskell G, Bauer MW, Durant J, Allum NC | title = Worlds apart?

==Learning==
In 1988, after prompting from the [[United States Congress]], the [[National Institute of General Medical Sciences]] ([[National Institutes of Health]]) (NIGMS) instituted a funding mechanism for biotechnology training. Universities nationwide compete for these funds to establish Biotechnology Training Programs (BTPs). Each successful application is generally funded for five years then must be competitively renewed. [[Graduate students]] in turn compete for acceptance into a BTP; if accepted, then stipend, tuition and health insurance support is provided for two or three years during the course of their [[Ph.D.]] thesis work. Nineteen institutions offer NIGMS supported BTPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Training/InstPredoc/Pages/PredocDesc-Biotechnology.aspx|title = Biotechnology Predoctoral Training Program|date = December 18, 2013|access-date = October 28, 2014|website = National Institute of General Medical Sciences|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biotechnology training is also offered at the undergraduate level and in community colleges.

'''Benjamin Rucker''' (June 6, 1889 – April 15, 1934) was an [[United States|American]] [[magic (illusion)|stage magician]], better known by his stage name '''Black Herman'''. He was the most prominent [[African-American]] magician of his time.&lt;ref name=Kraven&gt;{{cite web|last=Kraven|first=Vlad|title=Black Herman the Undead|url=http://vladkraven.com/black-herman-the-undead/|quote=Born in 1892 [sic], Benjamin Rucker started his career as an apprentice to a traveling magician and 'miracle' medicine salesman named Prince Herman. |accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.magictricks.com/black-herman.html |title=Black Herman |date= |accessdate=2016-12-20 |quote= |publisher=Magic Tricks }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born as '''Benjamin Rucker''' in [[Amherst, Virginia]] on June 6, 1889.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

Black Herman learned the art of staged illusions from a performer called Prince Herman, who was first his teacher and later his partner. The two sold [[patent medicine]] as well as performing [[prestidigitation]], making their act as much a [[medicine show]] as a stage show. When Prince Herman died, in 1909, Rucker, then only 17 years old, took the name Black Herman in his friend's honour and continued to tour, focusing on the stage act and dropping the medicine show aspects of his performance.&lt;ref name=Kraven /&gt;

Eventually, Herman made [[Harlem, New York City]] his home base. [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] policies were in effect at that time, so in the Northern states he could perform before racially mixed audiences, but when he traveled through the South, often with his own tent show, [[Racial segregation|segregation]] laws kept his audiences primarily Black.  His specialties included the [[Asrah levitation]], the production of rabbits, release from knots tied by audience members, and a "buried alive" act which began with his interment in an outdoor area called "Black Herman's Private Graveyard" and continued three days later with his exhumation, revival and a walk to the stage venue, where he performed the rest of his show.

Herman was the ostensible author of "Secrets of Magic, Mystery, and Legerdemain," a book published in 1925 that contains his semi-fictionalized autobiography, directions for simple illusions suitable to the novice  stage magician, advice on [[astrology]] and [[Luck|lucky numbers]], and a sampling of [[African-American]] [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]] [[magic (paranormal)|folk magic]] customs and practices. An announcement on the book's title page, "Black Herman Comes Through Every Seven Years", referred to Herman's pattern of returning to venues on a regular basis; the book was sold at his performances, although it has been determined that he was not the author.

Black Herman died in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], in April 15, 1934, after collapsing on stage, presumably the result of a [[heart attack]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Due to the fame of his "buried alive" act, many people in the audience refused to believe he was really dead, and thus it came about that his assistant, Washington Reeves, charged admission to view Rucker's corpse in the funeral home, bringing a dramatic close to a life spent in showmanship. He was buried in the [[Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[Bronx, New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Hold Funeral Services Here for Benjamin Rucker, Known Nationwide as the Magician, 'Black Herman'  |url= |quote= |newspaper=[[New York Age]] |date=April 17, 1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25349">Currently, '''Capital punishment in Russia'''&lt;ref name="ban" /&gt; is not allowed. There exists both an implicit [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] established by President [[Boris Yeltsin]] in 1996, and an explicit one, established by the [[Constitutional Court of Russia]] in 1999 and most recently reaffirmed in 2009. Russia has not executed anyone since 1996.

==History==

===The Russian death penalty ===
In medieval Russia capital punishment was extremely rare, and was even banned in many, if not most, [[Russian principalities|principalities]]. The [[Russkaya Pravda|Law of Yaroslavl]] (c. 1017) put restrictions on what crimes warranted execution. Later, the law was amended in much of the country to completely ban capital punishment.

The [[Russian Empire]] practiced the death penalty extensively, as did almost all modern states before the 20th century. One of the first legal documents resembling a modern [[penal code]] was enacted in 1398, which mentioned a single [[capital crime]]: a theft performed after two prior convictions (an early precursor to the current [[Three-strikes law]]s existing in several [[U.S. state]]s). The [[Sudebnik of 1497|Pskov Code of 1497]] extends this list significantly, mentioning three specialized theft instances (those committed in a [[church (building)|church]], [[Horse thief|stealing a horse]], or, as before, with two prior "strikes"), as well as [[arson]] and [[treason]]. The trend to increase the number of capital crimes continued: in 1649, this list included 63 crimes, a figure that nearly doubled during the reign of [[Peter I of Russia|Tsar Peter I]] (Peter the Great). The methods of [[execution]] were extremely cruel by modern standards (but fully consistent with the standards of the time), and included [[drowning]], [[burying alive]], and forcing liquid metal into the throat.&lt;ref name="pravoved"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rusetsky.com/death.htm | title=Правовед - правовой ресурс Русецкого Александра Смертная казнь (правовое регулирование) |work=rusetsky.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051103070251/http://www.rusetsky.com/death.htm |archive-date=November 3, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Surikov streltsi.jpg|350px|thumb|"The morning of the Streltsy execution" by [[Vasily Ivanovich Surikov]].]]

[[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]] (reigned 1741-1762) did not share her father Peter's views on the death penalty, and officially suspended it in 1745, effectively enacting a moratorium. This lasted for 11 years, at which point the death penalty was permitted again, after considerable opposition to the moratorium from both the nobility and, in part, from the Empress herself.&lt;ref name="pravoved" /&gt;

Perhaps the first public statement on the matter to be both serious and strong came from [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]] (Catherine the Great), whose liberal views were consistent with her acceptance of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. In her ''[[Nakaz]]'' of 1767, the empress expressed a disdain for the death penalty, considering it to be improper, adding: "In the usual state of the society, death penalty is neither useful nor needed." However, an explicit exception was still allowed for the case of someone who, even while convicted and incarcerated, "still has the means and the might to ignite public unrest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekaterina2.bnd.ru/entry/nakaz/nakaz.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070815032810/http://www.ekaterina2.bnd.ru/entry/nakaz/nakaz.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-08-15 |title=Екатерина II Великая: Статьи: Императрица Екатерина II и ее "Наказ" |work=bnd.ru}} &lt;/ref&gt; This specific exception applied to mutineers of [[Pugachev's Rebellion]] in 1775.
Consistent with Catherine's stance, the next several decades marked a shift of public perception against the death penalty. In 1824, the very existence of such a punishment was among the reasons for the legislature's refusal to approve a new version of the Penal Code. Just one year later, the [[Decembrist revolt]] failed, and a court sentenced 36 of the rebels to death.&lt;ref name="pravoved" /&gt; [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I's]] decision to [[Commutation of sentence|commute]] all but five of the sentences was highly unusual for the time, especially taking into account that revolts against the monarchy had almost universally resulted in an automatic death sentence, and was perhaps{{or?|date=April 2015}} due to society's changing views of the death penalty.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} By the late 1890s, capital punishment for murder was virtually never carried out, but substituted with 10 to 15 years imprisonment with hard labor, although it still was carried out for treason (for example, [[Alexander Ulyanov]] was hanged in 1887). However, in 1910, capital punishment was reintroduced and expanded, although still very seldom used.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Russian Republic===
The death penalty was officially outlawed on March 12, 1917 following the [[February Revolution]] and the establishment of the [[Russian Republic]]. On May 12, 1917, the death penalty became allowed for soldiers on the front.&lt;ref name="krotov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krotov.info/1/1/1/engl_03_rus.htm#army |title=Army soul of Russia |work=krotov.info |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510090950/http://www.krotov.info/1/1/1/engl_03_rus.htm |archive-date=May 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RSFSR and the Soviet Union===
{{main|Capital punishment in the Soviet Union}}

The [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]] confirmed the abolition almost immediately after assuming power, but restored it for some crimes very soon. Most notably, [[Fanny Kaplan]] was executed on 4 September 1918 for her attempt to assassinate Lenin six days prior. Over the next several decades, the death penalty was alternately permitted and prohibited, sometimes in very quick succession. The list of capital crimes likewise underwent several changes.

Under the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]], many were executed during the [[Great Purge]] in the 1930s. Many of the death sentences were pronounced by a specially appointed triple-person commission of officials, the [[NKVD troika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stalinism.ru/stati/repressii/smertnaya_kazn_v_sssr_v_1937-1938_gg.html|title=Смертная казнь в СССР в 1937-1938 гг|author=Administrator|work=stalinism.ru}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact number of executions is debated, with archival research suggesting it to be between 700,000 and 800,000 (''see also {{format link|Joseph_Stalin#Death_toll_and_allegations_of_genocide}}''). The verdict of capital punishment in the Soviet Union was called the "Supreme Degree of Punishment" (Vysshaya Mera Nakazaniya, VMN). Verdicts under [[Article 58]] (counter-revolutionary activity) often ended with a sentence that was abbreviated as VMN, and usually followed by executions through shooting, though other frequent verdicts were 10 years and 25 years (dubbed "Сталинский четвертак" ''Stalinskiy chetvertak'', "Stalin's Quarter") sentences.

The death penalty was again abolished on 26 May 1947, the strictest sentence becoming 25 years' imprisonment, before it was restored on 12 May 1950:&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hodgkinson and William A. Schabas, ''Capital Punishment: Strategies for Abolition'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004) p274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=29808 The Soviet Penal System in the USSR and the SBZ/GDR] Retrieved 3 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; first for [[treason]] and [[espionage]], and then for [[aggravated murder]].&lt;ref name="pravoved" /&gt;&lt;ref name="krotov" /&gt; The Penal Code of 1960 significantly extended the list of capital crimes. According to 1985-1989 statistics, the death penalty accounted for less than 1 in 2000 sentences.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} According to the [[GARF]] archives database, between 1978 and 1985 there were 3,058 sentences to death that had been appealed to the [[Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://opisi.garf.su/default.asp?base=garf&amp;menu=2&amp;v=5&amp;node=654&amp;fond=555&amp;opis=2422&amp;cf=135344&amp;co=110187&amp;cd=591398&amp;cp=153 ф.А385.

Дела по ходатайствам о помиловании осужденных к высшей мере наказания за 1978-1985 гг.], retrieved 2013-6-8&lt;/ref&gt; At least one woman was executed during this time, [[Antonina Makarova]], on August 11, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.pravda.ru/society/stories/12-12-2005/9372-death-0/|title=Woman who executed 1,500 people in WWII faced death sentence in 30 years|work=English pravda.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation carried out the death penalty intermittently, with up to 10 or so officially a year. In 1996, pending Russia's entry into the [[Council of Europe]], a moratorium was placed on the death penalty, which is still in place as of 2018.

==Current status==

===Statute limitations===
Article 20 of the [[Constitution of Russia|Russian Constitution]] states that everyone has the right to life, and that "until its abolition, death penalty may only be passed for the most serious crimes against human life." Additionally, all such sentences require [[jury trial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.ru/10003000/10003000-4.htm|title=Глава 2. Права и свободы человека и гражданина - Конституция Российской Федерации|work=constitution.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of the abolition wording has been interpreted by some&lt;ref name="krotov" /&gt; as a requirement that the death penalty be abolished at some point in the future.

The current Penal Code&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hro.org/docs/rlex/uk/ Уголовный кодекс Российской Федерации&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111052005/http://www.hro.org/docs/rlex/uk/ |date=November 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; permits the death penalty for five crimes:
* [[murder]], with certain [[Aggravation (law)|aggravating circumstances]] (article 105.2)
* encroachment on the Life of a Person Administering Justice or Engaged in a Preliminary Investigation (article 295)
* encroachment on the Life of an Officer of a Law-enforcement Agency (article 317)
* encroachment on the Life of a Statesman or a Public Figure (article 277)
* [[genocide]] (section 357).
No crime has a mandatory death sentence; each of the five sections mentioned above also permit a sentence of [[life imprisonment]] as well as a prison term of not less than eight or 12 (depending on the crime) nor more than twenty, years. Moreover, men under the age of 18 or above the age of 65 as of the time the crime was committed, and all women, are not eligible for a death sentence.&lt;ref name="pravoved" /&gt;

The Penal Execution Code specifies that the execution is to be carried out "non-publicly by means of shooting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consultant.ru/popular/uikrf/12_31.html#p2462|title=ИСПОЛНЕНИЕ НАКАЗАНИЯ В ВИДЕ СМЕРТНОЙ КАЗНИ - Уголовно-исполнительный кодекс РФ (УИК РФ) от 08.01.1997 N 1-ФЗ (Russian Federation Penal Execution Code DTD January 8, 1997, article 186) \ Консультант Плюс|date=29 April 2015|work=consultant.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moratorium===
One of the absolute requirements of the [[Council of Europe]] for all members is that the death penalty cannot be carried out for any crime. While the preferred method is abolition, the Council has demonstrated that it would accept a moratorium, at least temporarily. Consistent with this rule, on 25 January 1996, the Council required Russia to implement a moratorium immediately and fully abolish death penalty within three years, in order for its bid for inclusion in the organization be to be approved. In a little over a month, Russia agreed and became a member of the Council.&lt;ref name="t"&gt;[http://tanatos.ru/?nav=content&amp;id=276 Смерть - Тайны Смерти :: Tanatos :: Дневники Живых - Мертвые И Призраки :: Жизнь После Смерти. Смертная Казнь]&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the moratorium has actually happened as a matter of legal right is the subject of some controversy.&lt;ref name="ng"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2006/39/13.html|title=7 МЕСЯЦЕВ ДО СМЕРТНОЙ КАЗНИ|work=Новая Газета|access-date=2011-03-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904183013/http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2006/39/13.html#|archive-date=2008-09-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 1996, then-President [[Boris Yeltsin]] issued a [[decree]] "for the stepwise reduction in application of the death penalty in conjunction with Russia's entry into the [[Council of Europe]]", which is widely cited as ''de facto'' establishing such a moratorium. The decree called on the legislature to prepare a law which would abolish the death penalty, as well as a recommendation to decrease the number of capital crimes and require the authorities to treat those on the death row in a humane manner.&lt;ref name="ng" /&gt; Although the order may be read as not specifically outlawing the death penalty, this was eventually the practical effect, and it was accepted as such by the Council of Europe as Russia was granted membership in the organization. However, since the executions continued in the first half of 1996 - that is, after Russia signed the agreement - the Council was not satisfied and presented Russia with several ultimatums, threatening to expel the country if the death penalty continues to be carried out. In response, several more laws and orders have been enacted, and Russia has not executed anyone since August 1996.&lt;ref name="t" /&gt; The last person to be executed in Russia was a [[serial killer]] named [[Sergey Golovkin]], who was convicted in 1994 and shot on 2 August 1996.

On 2 February 1999, the [[Constitutional Court of Russia]] issued a temporary stay on any executions for a rather technical reason, but nevertheless granting the moratorium an unquestionable legal status for the first time. According to the Constitution as quoted above, a death sentence may be pronounced only by a jury trial, which were not yet implemented in some regions of the country. The court found that such disparity makes death sentences illegal in ''any'' part of the country, even those that do have the process of trial by jury implemented. According to the ruling, no death sentence may be passed until all regions of country have jury trials, which may happen as early as 2007, at which point the legal status of the death penalty may again become questionable.&lt;ref name="ng" /&gt;

On 15 November 2006, the [[Duma]] extended both the implementation of jury trials in the sole remaining region ([[Chechnya]]) and the moratorium on the death penalty by three years, until early 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2006/11/15/court2/|title=Госдума отсрочила введение смертной казни в России|work=lenta.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before the end of this moratorium, on 19 November 2009, the [[Constitutional Court of Russia]] extended the national moratorium "until the ratification of 6th Protocol to the [[European Convention of Human Rights]]".&lt;ref name="ban"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lenta.ru/news/2009/11/19/death/|title=Конституционный суд запретил применять в России смертную казнь|work=lenta.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court also ruled that the introduction of jury trials in Chechnya is not a valid precept for lifting the moratorium.

In April 2013, President [[Vladimir Putin]] said that lifting the moratorium was inadvisable.&lt;ref name="iz2013"/&gt;

== Public opinion ==
According to a 2006 survey by Fond Obschestvennoe Mneniye (Public Opinion Foundation), which was conducted on the 10th anniversary of the moratorium, the death penalty was supported by three quarters of the respondents, and only four percent of them favored the abolition of the death penalty. The moratorium itself was opposed by 55 percent of the respondents and supported by 28 percent of the respondents. Those supporting the moratorium had, on average, a higher level of education, lived in large cities and were younger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lenta.ru/news/2006/02/27/execute/ Lenta.ru: В России: Три четверти россиян поддерживают смертную казнь], retrieved 2013-8-6&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey conducted by the same company in 2012 (on a sample of 3,000) found that 62 percent of the respondents favored a return to the use of the death penalty, and 21 percent still supported the moratorim. In this survey, five percent of the respondents supported the abolition of the death penalty, and 66 percent supported the death penalty as a valid punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.by/news/world/108420 Россияне хотят вернуть смертную казнь - опрос] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106013638/http://www.interfax.by/news/world/108420 |date=2012-11-06 }}, 29.03.2012, retrieved 2013-8-6&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2013 survey by the [[Levada Center]], 54 percent of the respondents favored an equal (38 percent) or greater (16 percent) use of the death penalty as before the 1996 moratorium, a decline from 68 percent in 2002 and from 61 percent in 2012. This survey found that the death penalty now has a higher approval rating in urban areas (77 percent in Moscow for example), with men and among the elderly.&lt;ref name="iz2013"&gt;Сергей Подосенов, [http://izvestia.ru/news/552802 Более половины россиян за возвращение смертной казни], 1 июля 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2013/07/01/Russians-support-for-bringing-back-the-death-penalty-is-falling/UPI-35981372713701/|title=54 percent of Russians want return of capital punishment, survey says  - UPI.com|work=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Levada Center figures, the proportion of Russians seeking abolition of the death penalty was 12 percent in 2002, 10 percent in 2012 and 11 percent in 2013. According to the same source, the proportion of Russians approving of the moratorium increased from 12 percent in 2002 to 23 percent in 2013.&lt;ref name="iz2013" /&gt;

A February 2017 survey showed an increase of support for the death penalty. 44 percent of Russians wanted the death penalty returned and 41 percent said they opposed this measure. 15 percent of respondents said they did not have any opinion on the issue. In 2015, the share of those who supported it was 41 percent with 44 percent against.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rt.com/politics/411571-death-penalty-moratorium-will-never/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Russian opinion on the practice in Europe ==
After two terrorists were executed in [[Belarus]] in 2012 for their role in the [[2011 Minsk Metro bombing]], the Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] said that he urged all European countries to join the moratorium, including Belarus. However, he said that it is an internal affair of each state, and that despite condemning the execution that Russia still was a major supporter of the war on terror.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==
Historically, various types of capital punishment were used in Russia, such as [[hanging]], [[breaking wheel]], [[Death by burning|burning]], [[beheading]], etc. During the times of [[Ivan the Terrible]], capital punishment often took exotic and torturous forms, [[impalement]] being one of its most common types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenta.ru/articles/2013/11/04/ivan/|title="31 спорный вопрос" по истории: о пытках и казнях в эпоху опричнины: Наука и техника: Lenta.ru|work=lenta.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain crimes incurred specific forms of capital punishment, e.g. coin counterfeiters were executed by pouring molten lead into their throats, while certain religious crimes were punishable by burning alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gumer.info/bibliotek_Buks/Pravo/Article/sob_ul1649.php|title=Соборное уложение 1649г. - Электронная Библиотека истории права|work=gumer.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the times after [[Peter the Great]], [[hanging]] for military men and [[shooting]] for civilians became the default means of execution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maxpark.com/community/3758/content/938979|title=Смертная казнь в Российской империи: казнить, нельзя помиловать!|work=maxpark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; though certain types of non-lethal [[corporal punishment]], such as [[Flagellation|lashing]] or [[caning]], could result in the convict's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allpravo.ru/library/doc101p0/instrum3941/item3942.html|title=Текст статьи "История телесных наказаний в русском уголовном праве"  // Право России // ALLPRAVO.RU|work=allpravo.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Soviet Union]] and post-Soviet [[Russian Federation|Russia]], convicts awaited execution for a period around 9-18 months since the first sentence. That was the time typically needed for 2-3 appeals to be processed through the Soviet juridical system, depending on the level of the court that first sentenced the convict to death. Shooting was the only legal means of execution, though the exact procedure has never been codified. Unlike most other countries, execution did not involve any official ceremony: the convict was often given no warning and taken by surprise in order to eliminate fear, suffering and resistance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Where warning was given, it was usually just a few minutes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The process was usually carried out by single executioner, usage of [[firing squad]]s being limited to wartime executions. The most common method was to make the convict walk into a dead-end room, and shoot him from behind in the back of the head with a handgun.&lt;ref name="index.org.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.index.org.ru/ostrova/rafail.html|title=Как казнили в СССР.

The lights blinded and disoriented the convict, while the noise of the engine muffled the shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2yxa.ru/kazni/52/|title=2yxa.ru - Казни и Пытки, Ритуалы смертной казни|work=2yxa.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the execution was carried out outdoors in front of the grave in which the convict was to be buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rusrep.ru/article/2011/06/28/kazn/|title=Репортаж: Бессмертная казнь|work=rusrep.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body of the executed criminal was not given to the relatives, but rather buried in anonymous graves in undisclosed locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_12940/873caceb91c8123949118e9c893b80cd44d30f4c/|title=Russian Federation Penal Code Article 186.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computational cybernetics''' is the integration of [[cybernetics]] and [[computational intelligence]] techniques. Though the term Cybernetics entered the technical lexicon in the 1940s and 1950s, it was first used informally as a popular noun in the 1960s, when it became associated with [[computers]], [[robotics]], [[Artificial Intelligence]] and [[Science fiction]].

While Cybernetics is primarily concerned with the study of control systems, computational cybernetics focuses on their automatic (complex, autonomic, flexible, adaptive) operation. Furthermore, computational cybernetics covers not only mechanical, but biological (living), social and economical systems. To achieve this goal, it uses research from the fields of [[communication theory]], [[signal processing]], [[information technology]], [[control theory]], the theory of adaptive systems, the theory of complex systems ([[game theory]], and [[operational research]]). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ieeesmc.org/technical-activities/cybernetics/computational-cybernetics|title=Computational Cybernetics - IEEE SMC|website=www.ieeesmc.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

IEEE, a professional organization for the advancement of technology, has organized two international conferences focusing on computational cybernetics in 2008 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/conferencedetails/index.html?Conf_ID=31443|title=IEEE -|website=www.ieee.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/conferencedetails/index.html?Conf_ID=14320|title=IEEE -|website=www.ieee.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4212">'''Cryptospores''' are [[fossil]]ised primitive plant [[spore]]s that first appear in the [[fossil]] record during the middle of the [[Ordovician]] period.

==Evidence that cryptospores derive from land plants==

===Occurrence===
Cryptospores are generally found in non-marine [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s and decrease in abundance with distance offshore. This suggests that any cryptospores found in the [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] environment were transported there by the wind from the land, rather than originating from the marine environment.

===Wall Ultrastructure===
The walls of cryptospores consist of many lamellae (thin sheets). [[Marchantiophyta|Liverwort]]s, thought to be the most primitive land plants, also have this spore wall [[Comparative anatomy|morphology]].

===Chemical composition ===
(Some) cryptospores are composed of sporopollenin and have the same chemical makeup as co-occurring trilete spores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steemans|first=P.|author2=Lepot, K. |author3=Marshall, C.P. |author4= Le Hérissé, A. and Javaux, E.J. |title=FTIR characterisation of the chemical composition of Silurian miospores (cryptospores and trilete spores) from Gotland, Sweden|journal=Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology|date=2010|volume=162|issue=4|pages=577–590|doi=10.1016/j.revpalbo.2010.07.006|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034666710001557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other information==
Recently, fossils of plant [[Sporangium|sporangia]] have been found in [[Oman]] with cryptospores showing concentric lamellae in their walls, similar to [[liverworts]]. The earliest known cryptospores are from Middle [[Ordovician]] ([[Dapingian]]) strata of [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rubinstein|first=C.V.|author2=Gerrienne, P. |author3=de la Puente, G.S. |author4=Astini, R.A. |author5=Steemans, P. |title=Early Middle Ordovician evidence for land plants in Argentina (eastern Gondwana)|journal=New Phytologist|date=2010|volume=188|issue=2|pages=365–369|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03433.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03433.x/full|pmid=20731783}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spores from the Lindegård [[Mudstone]] (late [[Katian]]–early [[Hirnantian]]) represent the earliest record of early [[land plant]] [[spores]] from [[Sweden]] and possibly also from [[Baltica]] and implies that [[land plants]] had migrated to the [[palaeocontinent]] [[Baltica]] by at least the Late [[Ordovician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Badawy|first=A.S.|author2=Mehlqvist, K. |author3=Vajda, V. |author4= Ahlberg, P. and Calner, M. |title=Late Ordovician (Katian) spores in Sweden: oldest land plant remains from Baltica|journal=GFF|date=2014|volume=136|issue=1|pages=16–21|doi=10.1080/11035897.2014.899266|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/11035897.2014.899266#.U2RHetIW2So}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery reinforces the earlier suggestion that the migration of land plants from northern [[Gondwana]] to [[Baltica]] in the Late [[Ordovician]] was facilitated by the northward migration of [[Avalonia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steemans|first=P.|author2=Wellman, C.H. and Gerrienne, P. |title=Paleogeographic and paleoclimatic considerations based on Ordovician to Lochkovian vegetation|journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications|date=2010|volume=339|pages=49–58|doi=10.1144/SP339.5|url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/339/1/49.abstract|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is evidenced by the co-occurrence of reworked, Early–Middle [[Ordovician]] [[acritarchs]], possibly suggesting an Avalonian provenance in a [[foreland basin]] system.

'''Cycads''' {{IPAc-en|'|s|aI|k|ae|d|z}} are [[seed plant]]s with a long fossil history that were formerly more abundant and more diverse than they are today. They typically have a stout and woody ([[ligneous]]) [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] with a [[crown (botany)|crown]] of large, hard and stiff, [[evergreen]] leaves. They usually have [[pinnate]] leaves. The individual plants are either all male or all female ([[dioecious]]). Cycads vary in size from having trunks only a few centimeters to several meters tall. They typically grow very slowly and live very long, with some specimens known to be as much as 1,000 years old. Because of their superficial resemblance, they are sometimes mistaken for [[Arecaceae|palms]] or [[fern]]s, but they are not closely related to either group.

Cycads are [[gymnosperms]] (naked seeded), meaning their [[fertilization|unfertilized]] seeds are open to the air to be directly fertilized by [[pollination]], as contrasted with [[angiosperms]], which have enclosed seeds with more complex fertilization arrangements. Cycads have very specialized [[pollinator]]s, usually a specific species of [[beetle]]. They have been reported to [[nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] in association with various [[cyanobacteria]] living in the roots (the "coralloid" roots).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authors=Rai, A.N.; Soderback, E.; Bergman, B. |year=2000 |title=Tansley Review No. 116.

This neurotoxin may enter a  human food chain as the cycad seeds may be eaten directly as a source of flour by humans or by wild or feral animals such as bats, and humans may eat these animals. It is [[hypothesize]]d that this is a source of some [[neurological disease]]s in humans.&lt;ref name=Holtcamp&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holtcamp, W. | year = 2012 | title = The emerging science of BMAA: do cyanobacteria contribute to neurodegenerative disease? | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 120 | issue = 3 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.120-a110 | pmid=22382274 | pmc=3295368 | pages=a110–a116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox and Davis"&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Cox, PA, Davis, DA, Mash, DC, Metcalf, JS, Banack, SA. | year = 2015 | title = Dietary exposure to an environmental toxin triggers neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid deposits in the brain | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B | volume = 283 | issue = 1823 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2015.2397 | pages=20152397 | pmid=26791617 | pmc=4795023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File: Cycad leaves semicircle.jpg|thumb|Cycads have a rosette of pinnate leaves around cylindrical trunk]]
Cycads have a [[cylindrical]] trunk which usually does not [[branch]].
Leaves grow directly from the trunk, and typically fall when older, leaving a crown of leaves at the top. The leaves grow in a [[rosette (botany)|rosette]] form, with new foliage emerging from the top and center of the crown. The trunk may be buried, so the leaves appear to be emerging from the ground, so the plant appears to be a [[rosette (botany)|basal rosette]]. The leaves are generally large in proportion to the trunk size, and sometimes even larger than the trunk.

The leaves are [[pinnate]] (in the form of bird feathers, [[pinnation|pinnae]]), with a central leaf stalk from which parallel "ribs" emerge from each side of the stalk, perpendicular to it. The leaves are typically either compound (the leaf stalk has [[leaflet (botany)|leaflets]] emerging from it as "ribs"), or have edges ([[Leaf margin|margin]]s) so deeply cut ([[incised]]) so as to appear compound. Some species have leaves that are [[bipinnate]], which means the leaflets each have their own subleaflets, growing in the same form on the leaflet as the leaflets grow on the stalk of the leaf ([[fractal|self-similar geometry]]).

== Confusion with palms ==
Due to superficial similarities in foliage and plant structure between cycads and palms they are often confused with each other. In reality, they belong to completely different [[Phylum|phyla]], and are not closely related at all. The similar structure may be evidence of [[convergent evolution]].

Despite this, there are still a number of differences between them. For one, both male and female cycads bear a cone-like reproductive structure called a [[strobilus]], while palms are angiosperms and so flower and bear fruit. The mature foliage looks very similar between both groups, but the young emerging leaves of a cycad resemble a [[fiddlehead fern]] before they unfold and take their place in the rosette, while the leaves of palms are never coiled up and instead are just small versions of the mature frond. Another difference is in the [[Plant stem|stem]]. Both plants leave scars on the stem below the rosette where there used to be leaves, but the scars of a cycad are [[Helical symmetry|helically]] arranged and small, while the scars of palms are a circle that wraps around the whole stem. The stems of cycads are also in general rougher and shorter than those of palms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tree|last=Tudge|first=Colin|publisher=Crown Publishers|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4000-5036-9|location=New York|pages=70–72, 139–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Bowenia spectabilis.JPG|thumb|''[[Bowenia spectabilis]]'' : plant with single frond in the Daintree rainforest, north-east Queensland]]

The three extant [[family (biology)|families]] of cycads all belong to the order [[Cycadales]], and are [[Cycadaceae]], [[Stangeriaceae]], and [[Zamiaceae]]. These cycads have changed little since the Jurassic, compared to some major evolutionary changes in other plant divisions. Five additional families belonging to the [[Medullosales]] became extinct by the end of the Paleozoic Era.

Cycads are most closely related to the extinct [[Bennettitales]], and are also relatively close relatives to the [[Ginkgoales]], as shown in the following phylogeny:{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Historical diversity==
The probable former range of cycads can be inferred from their global distribution. For example, the family Stangeriaceae only contains three extant species in Africa and Australia. Diverse fossils of this family have been dated to 135&amp;nbsp;mya, indicating that diversity may have been much greater before the Jurassic and late Triassic [[Extinction event|mass extinction events]]. However, the cycad fossil record is generally poor and little can be deduced about the effects of each mass extinction event on their diversity.

Instead, correlations can be made between the number of extant [[gymnosperms]] and [[angiosperms]]. It is likely that cycad diversity was affected more by the great angiosperm radiation in the mid-Cretaceous than by extinctions. Very slow cambial growth was first used to define cycads, and because of this characteristic the group could not compete with the rapidly growing, relatively short-lived angiosperms, which now number over 250,000&amp;nbsp;species, compared to the 1080&amp;nbsp;remaining gymnosperms.&lt;ref&gt;Christenhusz, M. J. M.; Byng, J. W. (2016). "The number of known plants species in the world and its annual increase". Phytotaxa. Magnolia Press. 261 (3): 201–217. doi:10.11646/phytotaxa.261.3.1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is surprising that the cycads are still extant, having been faced with extreme competition and five major extinctions. The ability of cycads to survive in relatively dry environments, where plant diversity is generally lower, may explain their long persistence and longevity.

===Origins===
[[File:American fossil cycads (1906) (18143988832).jpg|thumb|Fossil images of Cycads found in America (1906)]]
The cycad fossil record dates to the early [[Permian]], 280 million years ago ([[mya (unit)|mya]]). {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} There is controversy over older cycad fossils that date to the late [[Carboniferous]] period, 300&amp;ndash;325 &amp;nbsp;mya. This [[clade]] probably diversified extensively within its first few million years, although the extent to which it radiated is unknown because relatively few fossil specimens have been found. The regions to which cycads are restricted probably indicate their former distribution in the [[Pangea]] before the supercontinents [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwana]] separated.&lt;ref&gt;(Hermsen et al. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have indicated the common perception of existing cycad species as [[living fossil]]s is largely misplaced, with only ''[[Bowenia]]'' dating to the [[Cretaceous]] or earlier.  Although the cycad lineage itself is ancient, most extant species have evolved in the last 12 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nagalingum | first1 = N.

[[File:Fossilized cycad New York Botanical Garden.jpg|thumb|petrified cycad fossil, New York Botanical Garden]]
The [[family (biology)|family]] [[Stangeriaceae]] (named for Dr. [[William Stanger (surveyor)|William Stanger]], 1811&amp;ndash;1854), consisting of only three [[extant taxon|extant]] [[species]], is thought to be of Gondwanan origin, as fossils have been found in [[Lower Cretaceous]] deposits in [[Argentina]], dating to 70&amp;ndash;135&amp;nbsp;mya. The family [[Zamiaceae]] is more diverse, with a fossil record extending from the middle [[Triassic]] to the [[Eocene]] (54&amp;ndash;200&amp;nbsp;mya) in [[North America|North]] and South America, [[Europe]], Australia, and [[Antarctic]]a, implying the family was present before the break-up of Pangea. The family [[Cycadaceae]] is thought to be an early offshoot from other cycads, with fossils from [[Eocene]] deposits (38&amp;ndash;54&amp;nbsp;mya) in [[Japan]], [[China]], and [[North America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=DJ|author2=KR Johnson |title=First Record of cycad leaves from the Eocene Republic flora|journal=Washington Geology|date=December 1997|volume=25|issue=4|page=37|url=http://www.nwpaleo.org/Resources/WA_Geology/WA_Geol_1997-CycadLeaves.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating this family originated in Laurasia. ''[[Cycas]]'' is the only [[genus]] in the family and contains 99&amp;nbsp;species, the most of any cycad genus. [[Molecular biology|Molecular]] data have recently shown ''Cycas'' species in [[Australasia]] and the east coast of Africa are recent arrivals, suggesting [[adaptive radiation]] may have occurred. The current distribution of cycads may be due to radiations from a few ancestral types sequestered on Laurasia and Gondwana, or could be explained by [[genetic drift]] following the separation of already evolved genera. Both explanations account for the strict [[endemism]] across present continental lines.

==Distribution==
{{see also|List of cycad species by country}}
The living cycads are found across much of the [[subtropical]] and [[tropical]] parts of the world. The greatest diversity occurs in [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} They are also found in [[Mexico]], the [[Antilles]], southeastern [[United States of America|United States]], [[Australia]], [[Melanesia]], [[Micronesia]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Madagascar]], and [[Southern Africa|southern]] and tropical [[Africa]], where at least 65 [[species]] occur. Some can survive in harsh [[desert]] or semi-desert [[climate]]s ([[xerophytic]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=National Recovery Plan for the MacDonnell Ranges Cycad ''Macrozamia macdonnellii'' |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/c17de516-c635-4c67-b040-c9db4da380e4/files/macrozamia-macdonnellii.pdf |publisher=Department of Natural Resources, Environment, The Arts and Sport, Northern Territory |accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; others in wet [[rain forest]] conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Bermingham, E. |author2=Dick, C.W. |author3=Moritz, C. |year=2005  |title=Tropical Rainforests: Past, Present, and Future |publisher=University of Chicago Press  |isbn=9780226044682 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Y3dXZyCCDpEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some in both.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url=http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/42000/0 |title=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species |chapter=''Macrozamia communis''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some can grow in [[sand]] or even on [[rock (geology)|rock]], some in oxygen-poor, swampy, [[bog]]-like soils rich in [[organic material]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Some are able to grow in full sun, some in full shade, and some in both.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Some are [[Sodium chloride|salt]] tolerant ([[halophyte]]s).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

[[File:Cycads world distribution.png|thumb|800px|center|&lt;center&gt;Approximate world distribution of living Cycadales&lt;/center&gt;]]

Species diversity of the extant cycads peaks at 17˚ 15"N and 28˚ 12"S, with a minor peak at the [[equator]]. There is therefore not a [[Latitudinal gradients in species diversity|latitudinal diversity gradient]] towards the equator but towards the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. However, the peak near the northern tropic is largely due to ''Cycas'' in Asia and ''Zamia'' in the New World, whereas the peak near the southern tropic is due to ''Cycas'' again, and also to the diverse genus ''Encephalartos'' in southern and central Africa, and ''Macrozamia'' in Australia. Thus, the distribution pattern of cycad species with latitude appears to be an artifact of the geographical isolation of the remaining cycad genera and their species, and perhaps because they are partly [[xerophytic]] rather than simply [[tropical]].
Notes: The distribution area on the map should be expanded to include the range of ''Macrozamia macdonnelliana'' in the central region of Australia, ''Zamia boliviana'' in Bolivia and Mato Grosso, Brazil, ''Cycas thouarsii'' on Comoros and Seychelles, and ''Cycas micronesica'' on the islands of Guam, Palau, Rota, &amp; Yap. 
Also, the depiction of cycad distribution in Africa, particularly the western boundary, should be improved to show the actual range limits, rather than national borders.

==Cultural significance==
In [[Vanuatu]], the cycad is known as ''namele'' and is an important symbol of traditional culture. It serves as a powerful [[taboo]] sign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Princely Title |url=http://dailypost.vu/news/a-princely-title/article_3b08dcb8-6286-51f6-bc85-ac5aee546242.html |website=Vanuatu Daily Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a pair of ''namele'' leaves appears on the [[Flag of Vanuatu|national flag]] and coat of arms. Together with the [[Cordyline terminalis|nanggaria]] plant, another symbol of Vanuatu culture, the ''namele'' also gives its name to [[Nagriamel]], an indigenous political movement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1232">'''DUAL''' is a general [[cognitive architecture]] integrating the [[connectionist]] and [[symbol]]ic approaches at the micro level. DUAL is based on decentralized representation and [[emergence|emergent computation]]. It was inspired by the [[Society of Mind]] idea proposed by [[Marvin Minsky]] but departs from the initial proposal in many ways. Computations in DUAL emerge from the interaction of many micro-agents each of which is hybrid symbolic/connectionist device. The agents exchange messages and activation via links that can be learnt and modified, they form coalitions which collectively represent concepts, episodes, and facts. 

Several models have been developed on the basis of DUAL. These include: [[AMBR]] (a model of analogy-making and memory), JUDGEMAP (a model of judgment), PEAN (a model of perception), etc.

DUAL is developed by a team at the [[New Bulgarian University]] led by [[Boicho Kokinov]]. The second version was co-authored by Alexander Petrov. The third version is co-authored by Georgi Petkov and Ivan Vankov.

The [[World War I|First World War]] was fought on many fronts around the world from the battlefields of Europe to the far-flung colonies in the Pacific and Africa. While it is most famous for the trench combat stalemate that existed on Europe's [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], in other theatres of combat the fighting was mobile and often involved set-piece battles and cavalry charges. The [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] often took thousands of casualties a day during the big offensive pushes but it was the West that saw the most concentrated slaughter. It was in the west that the newly industrialized world powers could focus their end products on the military-industrial complex. The deadliest day of the war was during the opening day of the conflict. The Imperial German war council had initiated the [[Schlieffen Plan]] which involved multiple armies flooding through the borders of Belgium and France. On August 22, 1914, during the [[Battle of the Frontiers]] five separate French armies engaged the German invaders independently of each other. Across all those battlefields, on that single day, 27,000 French soldiers lost their lives protecting their country.&lt;ref name= "Lucas p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|2017|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[Casualty (person)|casualty]]'' in warfare can often be misleading. It often does not refer to those who are killed on the battlefield rather it refers to those who can no longer fight. This can include disabled by injuries, disabled by [[psychological trauma]], [[prisoner of war|captured]], [[desertion|deserted]], or [[missing in action|missing]]. A casualty is by definition a soldier who is no longer available for the immediate battle or campaign, the major consideration in combat; the number of casualties is simply the number of members of a unit who are not available for duty. For example, on March 21, 1918, during the opening day of [[Spring Offensive|Kaiserschlacht]], the Germans casualties are broken down into 10,851 killed, 28,778 wounded, 300 POW or taken prisoner for a total of 39,929 casualties.&lt;ref name= "Middlebrook p. 312"&gt;{{harvnb|Middlebrook|2007|p=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''casualty'' has been used in a military context since at least 1513.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed gives a 1513 reference for military casualty, and an 1844 reference for civilian use&lt;/ref&gt; In this article the numbers killed refer to those [[killed in action]], killed by [[disease]] or someone who died from their wounds.

'''Death Locket''' ('''Rebecca Ryker''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Death Locket first appeared in issue #1 of the ''[[Avengers Arena]]'' series as part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, and was created by [[Dennis Hopeless]] and [[Kev Walker]].

Death Locket appears as one of the main characters in ''[[Avengers Undercover]]'' beginning in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=48419 |title=NYCC EXCLUSIVE: HOPELESS IS SEDUCED BY EVIL IN "AVENGERS UNDERCOVER" |publisher=Comicbookresources.com |date=2013-10-11 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
A female teenage version of Deathlok is one of sixteen teenagers kidnapped by [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] who forces them to fight each other to the death in his latest version of Murderworld.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; As the games in Murderworld begin, she faces off against [[Hazmat (comics)|Hazmat]] and then fights [[Cammi (comics)|Cammi]] soon after. Cammi gives her the nickname Death Locket. Throughout the first day, Death Locket remembers the past events that led to her origins. She is revealed to be Rebecca Ryker, the daughter of Harlan Ryker. After being maimed in an explosion that killed her mother and brother, Rebecca was rebuilt using the [[Deathlok]] technology that her father developed. She joins the Braddock Academy group (consisting of [[Apex (comics)|Apex]], [[Kid Briton]], [[Anachronism (comics)|Anachronism]], [[Cullen Bloodstone|Bloodstone]] and [[Nara (comics)|Nara]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juston Seyfert|Juston]] is attacked by an unidentified cybernetic creature and the Sentinel he is working on folds around him apparently crushing him.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

An earthquake separates Bloodstone and Anachronism from Apex, Nara, Kid Briton, and Death Locket. An injured Reptil wakes up and clears [[Chase Stein|Chase]]'s reputation, saying that Death Locket was the one who attacked him. Meanwhile, Rebecca goes dormant as her Death Locket cybernetics take over and she blasts Nara off a cliff and into the ocean. Kid Briton is enraged by this and tries to kill her until Apex orders him not to.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; Nara, Anachronism, and Bloodstone manage to survive falling into the chasm and come to the conclusion that Apex is manipulating Death Locket and Kid Briton to her own ends. Nara and Apex later start arguing and Apex confirms that she was the one who ordered Death Locket to attack Nara.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; Juston Seyfert is revealed to have survived the attack from the cybernetic creature, but is now paralyzed below the waist due to the injuries sustained when the Sentinel crashed. Distraught at the loss of his best friend, Juston salvages the remains of the Sentinel and creates a suit of battle armor which he uses to attack Death Locket.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' #8&lt;/ref&gt; Apex uses Death Locket to help her kill Nico.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' #10&lt;/ref&gt; After the Staff of One resurrects Nico, she disassembles Death Locket's cybernetic arm, and traps her and Apex underground. Death Locket explores the facility she and Apex end up in.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' #12&lt;/ref&gt; Apex's brother Tim repairs Death Locket's arm, giving her a new cannon, and she unleashes Chris Powell, the original Darkhawk, to attack Arcade.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' #16&lt;/ref&gt; Arcade soon escapes and talks Apex into finishing the game. She regains control of Death Locket and uses her to blast Chris.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' #17&lt;/ref&gt; Apex unleashes bugs, sentient typhoon, and weaponized sand to attack the remaining teens on Murderworld.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' #18&lt;/ref&gt; Tim soon breaks Death Locket free, and she becomes enraged enough to attack Apex. Apex soon reverts to Tim and asks Death Locket to shoot him, thereby stopping the games. She is shocked at first, but soon complies, and everyone is able to escape Murderworld and disperse.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' #18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avengers Undercover===
Once news broke about Arcade's kidnappings, Death Locket and the other Murder World Survivors became infamous. Death Locket was the subject of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents gushing over her actions in the Arena, which was something she didn't appreciate.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; However, when Anachronism reveals Bloodstone's gone missing, all the survivors team up to head to [[Bagalia]] to find him. On their way in, Death Locket reveals that she really doesn't know how to fight, but Hazmat encourages her to use her gun and then congratulates her on how well it worked. Once they find Bloodstone, he reveals that he enjoys life among the villains, and the others, minus Cammi, start to enjoy it as well. Death Locket even gets hit on by Excavator of the Wrecking Crew. When Cammi tries to tell the others to leave, Bloodstone instead has [[Daimon Hellstrom]] teleport the group to Arcade's latest party so they can kill him.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; While at the party, Death Locket escorts Cullen and Nico to take down Arcade's computers and stop his powers so the group can fight him. They succeed and beat up Arcade before Hazmat kills him with a large radiation blast.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; After escaping the mansion, the group is captured by S.H.I.E.L.D., but are soon "rescued" by Daimon Hellstorm. The Son of Satan brings the group before [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]] who offers the group a chance to join his forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; While taking the tour of Bagalia given by [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], Becca and Chase find themselves bonding with the Young Masters. Once again, Becca finds herself bonding with Excavator. The rest of the group meets up while Becca is hanging out with the Young Masters. Every member of the group, with the exception of Cammi, accepts Baron Zemo's offer.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; While playing games with Excavator and the Young Masters, which include firing laser guns at each other during kart races, Chase tries to get Death Locket alone, saying he has been trying to do so for a week. Before Chase can tell her a secret, an alarm sounds and the Young Masters are called into action. The group battles A.I.M. on A.I.M. Island. She begins to enjoy combat, thinking of it as a game. Death Locket sees Captain America land a Quinjet in the battle. Excavator encourages her to shoot Captain America in the back. Chase intervenes and saves the captain's life and attacks Excavator. He informs Becca that the group never really joined the Masters of Evil and have infiltrated the group to try and take them down from the inside. As Excavator and Chase battle, they tell Death Locket to pick a side, and in a state of panic she fires and shoots Chase in the chest.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; When returning to Bagalia, Death Locket lies to the group saying Chase was injured in combat. He is left comatose.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #7&lt;/ref&gt; Over the span of three months, Death Locket embraced being part of the Young Masters. Getting a new costume, haircut, and a number of piercings on her right ear and eyebrow. She is enjoying battling the forces of S.H.I.E.L.D. Hazmat tries to secretly contact Becca, who reveals she knew the truth of the undercover team. She, and the other Young Masters, ambush Hazmat, but were defeated.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #8&lt;/ref&gt; Death Locket joins with the forces of Bagalia to fight the number of superheroes who came to rescue the team and confront Baron Zemo. Baron Zemo, Madame Masque, Constrictor, Daimon Hellstrom, and Death Locket teleport onto the S.H.I.E.L.D. Hellicarrier Circe. The Baron has Death Locket use her powers to crack the helicarrier's guidance system and fly them out, which she easily achieves.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #9&lt;/ref&gt; After gaining control of the helicarrier, she hacked into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s communication network, which gave Baron Zemo access to every television, phone, computer, and tablet in the world. When confronted by Cammi, now using Arcade's God Mode technology from Murderworld, Death Locket surrenders. She escapes with the Masters of Evil and is last seen as the pilot of their airship.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Her left arm can transform into a powerful ray-gun.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; She is vulnerable to control by Apex's technopathy, and also may generally lack control over her abilities.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; It is not yet revealed whether she has cybernetic uplink and other [[Deathlok]] abilities, but she was able to shut down Arcade's complex computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' #18&lt;/ref&gt; She is seen struggling to use her cybernetic uplink to take control of the computer systems in Arcade's mansion.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; After several months, she has gotten better with her uplink and is able to take over a S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier and pilot it single-handed,&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #9&lt;/ref&gt; and hack into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s worldwide communication network in a matter of minutes.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;

Her Deathlok cybernetics use nanite antibodies to turn any prosthetic limbs designed by SHIELD into weapons, each version more powerful then the previous.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

She is seen having the ability to alter the form of her cybernetic arm into different shapes, such as a spiked mace.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

While she gained some combat experience fighting alongside the Young Masters, she is still inept at combat, and was easily bested by Hazmat.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aaliyah]] was an American singer and actress who was killed in a plane crash on August 25, 2001 at the [[Marsh Harbour Airport]] on the [[Abaco Islands]], Bahamas. She had just completed filming for the music video for her single "[[Rock the Boat (Aaliyah song)|Rock the Boat]]". Employees of [[Virgin Records America]] accompanied her on the flight. The [[Cessna 402]] twin-engine light aircraft, piloted by Luis Morales III, crashed shortly after takeoff. In addition to Aaliyah, eight other people were killed in the plane crash. She was 22 years old.

The investigation following the crash looked into the possibility that the aircraft was overloaded. Three days after the crash, Aaliyah's remains were returned to the United States. Her funeral was held on August 31, 2001, in [[Manhattan]]. Her death came only a month after the release of her self-titled third album, ''[[Aaliyah (album)|Aaliyah]]''. Posters for the album became memorials for grieving fans. At her funeral, she was eulogized by her brother [[Rashad Haughton]].

==Background==
Appearing on [[BET]]'s ''[[106 &amp; Park]]'' on August 21, 2001, Aaliyah announced that shooting of the video for the single "[[Rock the Boat (Aaliyah song)|Rock the Boat]]", to be directed by [[Hype Williams]], would begin the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2014/08/check-footage-aaliyahs-last-interview-ever/|title=Check Out The Footage of Aaliyah's Last Interview Ever|publisher=XXL|date=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly sixty people worked on the video in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]].&lt;ref name=NYTHastes /&gt; On August 22, she filmed underwater shots for the video in [[Miami]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;Farley, pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 23, Aaliyah and employees of [[Virgin Records America]] flew to the Bahamas on two flights using a [[Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner#Metro III|Fairchild Metro III]], [[air charter|chartered]] through Sky Limo.&lt;ref name=NYTHastes&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/08/arts/music/08AALI.html|title=Aaliyah - Haste, Errors and a Fallen Star|publisher=New York Times|date=September 8, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was scheduled to leave the Bahamas on August 26, but chose to leave the day before since she had finished early. Williams recalled: "Aaliyah left mid-production, so we were still shooting when she left".&lt;ref name=RollingStone&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/aaliyah-1979-2001-20011011?page=2|title=Aaliyah Obituary: Remembering the R&amp;B Star|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=October 11, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to her brother, [[Rashad Haughton]], this was the first time in her career that she was not accompanied by a member of her family. At the time of the video's shooting, Rashad was in [[Australia]], and her mother had recently had eye surgery and was being cared for by her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Farley|title=Aaliyah: More Than A Woman|page=176|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=0-7434-5566-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
&lt;!-- [[File:Aaliyah last picture.png|thumb|Aaliyah arriving in the Bahamas two days before her death|left]] --&gt;On Saturday, August 25, 2001, after Aaliyah and the record company employees had completed filming the music video for "Rock the Boat", At 6:50&amp;nbsp;p.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]), they boarded a twin-engine [[Cessna 402|Cessna 402B]] ([[Aircraft registration|registration]] N8097W) at the [[Marsh Harbour Airport]], located on the [[Abaco Islands]], for the return trip back to [[Opa-locka Airport]] in Florida.&lt;ref name="MTV News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1448402/20010826/aaliyah.jhtml |title=Aaliyah Killed in Plane Crash |last=Schumacher-Rasmussen |first=Eric |date=August 26, 2001 |publisher=MTV News |accessdate=April 9, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418020928/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1448402/20010826/aaliyah.jhtml |archivedate=April 18, 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The return flight was originally booked for the following day, but filming had finished early, and Aaliyah and her entourage were eager to return to the U.S. They made the decision to leave immediately. The aircraft designated for the return flight was smaller than the one on which they had originally arrived, but it accommodated the whole party and all of their equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sutherland|2005|p=119|Ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passengers had grown impatient because the Cessna was supposed to arrive at 4:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. EDT, but did not arrive until 6:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. EDT.&lt;ref name=NYTHastes /&gt; Charter pilot Lewis Key claimed to have overheard passengers arguing with fellow pilot Luis Morales III prior to take off, adding that Morales warned them that there was too much weight for a "safe flight". Key further stated: "He tried to convince them the plane was overloaded, but they insisted they had chartered the plane and they had to be in Miami Saturday night."&lt;ref name=FoxNewsAugust27 /&gt; Key indicated that Morales gave in to the passengers and that he had trouble starting one of the engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=102736|title=More Questions Emerge in Aaliyah Crash|date=August 29, 2001|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff, about {{convert|200|ft|m|-1}} from the runway.&lt;ref name="MTV News"/&gt; Aaliyah and the eight others on board: Morales, hair stylist Eric Foreman, Anthony Dodd, security guard Scott Gallin, family friend Keith Wallace, make-up artist Christopher Maldonado, and [[Blackground Records]] employees Douglas Kratz and Gina Smith were all killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/08/26/death.aaliyah/ |title=U.S. investigators to probe Aaliyah crash |date=August 27, 2001 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=April 8, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413035550/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/08/26/death.aaliyah/ |archivedate=April 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallin survived the initial impact and, according to [[paramedic]]s, spent his last moments worrying about Aaliyah's condition.&lt;ref name="Farley169-170" /&gt; Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman for the U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) in [[Atlanta]], identified the aircraft as being owned by Florida-based company Skystream. Initial crash reports identified Luis Morales as "L Marael".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1510034.stm|title=R&amp;B's Aaliyah dies in plane crash|date=August 26, 2001|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key suggested that [[engine failure]], along with overloading of the aircraft, could have caused the crash, recalling that others had seen the plane experience an engine failure on takeoff. One witness believed that no one could have survived the accident because of the crash intensity and the fact that the aircraft had disintegrated upon impact. He also recalled the condition of the bodies: "It was an awful sight. Some bodies were so badly disfigured, you couldn't identify them. And two guys were alive — one screaming and screaming for help. He was horribly burned all over."&lt;ref name=FoxNewsAugust27&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2001/08/27/argument-broke-out-before-aaliyah-plane-crash-witness-reports/|title=Argument Broke Out Before Aaliyah Plane Crash, Witness Reports|date=August 27, 2001|publisher=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 25-year-old charter pilot who witnessed the crash saw the Cessna go down as he was working on some machinery "about half a mile" away. He recalled the aircraft being only "60 to 100 feet" off the ground before it crashed. He went to get a fire truck and was stunned by what he saw upon arriving at the crash site. "I've seen crashes before but that was probably one of the worst ones," he said. "It was pretty devastating. The aircraft was broken into pieces and some of the seats were thrown from the aircraft."&lt;ref&gt;Farley, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New York Post]]'' printed one of the last photographs taken of Aaliyah, but wrongly labeled it as taken before the crash with a fan, Alvin Lightbourne, who wanted it as a [[souvenir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://aaliyahremembered2.homestead.com/files/AaliyahNYPostFrontCover08282001r.jpg|title=Photograph of cover|publisher=homestead.com |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photo was in fact taken when Aaliyah arrived to the Bahamas, on Thursday, August 23. She had spoken to the fan for 15 minutes and gave him a hug as well. Lightbourne praised her for a recent donation to a charity and Aaliyah explained: "God blessed me with money and now it's time to give back."&lt;ref name="Farley169-170"&gt;Farley, pp. 169-170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheObserver&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.theguardian.com/focus/story/0,6903,545575,00.html|title=Death of a soul diva|publisher=The Observer|date=September 2, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaliyah spoke a month before her death about her favorite dream: "Someone's following me and I don't know why. I'm scared. Then suddenly I lift off. Far away. As if I'm swimming in the air. Nobody can reach me. Nobody can touch me. It's a wonderful feeling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://uk.eonline.com/news/42093/aaliyah-funeral-set-pilot-probed|title=Aaliyah Funeral Set; Pilot Probed|publisher=[[E!]]|author=Marcus Errico| date=August 29, 2001 | accessdate =January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
According to the findings of an [[inquest]] conducted by the [[coroner]]'s office in the Bahamas, Aaliyah suffered from "severe burns and a blow to the head", in addition to severe [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] and a weak heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/aaliyah/15575|title=Coroner Delivers Verdict Over Aaliyah Death Crash|date=November 20, 2003|work=NME|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coroner theorized that she went into such a state of shock that even if she had survived the crash, her recovery would have been nearly impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/2003/11/21/aaliyah.htm|title=Bahamas Coroner delivers verdict in Aaliyah death crash|date=November 21, 2003|work=Caribbean News|publisher=Caribbean Net News|accessdate=February 7, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040127093955/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/2003/11/21/aaliyah.htm|archivedate=January 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies, some of them badly burned, were taken to the morgue at Princess Margaret Hospital in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], where they remained until relatives made positive identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2001-08-27/entertainment/sfl-ent-aaliyah-remembered-082511_1_plane-crash-cessna-402b-rock-da-boat|title=Singer Aaliyah dies in Bahamas plane crash|date=August 27, 2001|first=Bill|last=Hirschman|publisher=Sun Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent investigation determined that when the aircraft attempted to depart, it was over its maximum takeoff weight by {{convert|700|lb|kg|-1}} and had one more passenger than it was certified to carry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1456119/20020716/aaliyah.jhtml|title=Cocaine, Alcohol Found in Pilot of Aaliyah's Plane|last=Moss|first=Corey|date=July 16, 2002|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=June 17, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090623072850/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1456119/20020716/aaliyah.jhtml| archivedate= June 23, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; An informational report issued by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] stated, "The airplane was seen lifting off the runway, and then nose down, impacting in a marsh on the south side of the departure end of runway 27."&lt;ref name="NTSB"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20010907X01905&amp;ntsbno=MIA01RA225&amp;akey=1|title=NTSB Identification: MIA01RA225|publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]]|accessdate=June 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It indicated that the pilot was not approved to fly the aircraft. Morales had falsely obtained his FAA license by showing logs of hundreds of flight hours he had never flown. He may also have falsified the number of hours he had flown to get the job with his employer, [[Blackhawk International Airways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simmonds|2008|p=455|Ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Morales' toxicology report revealed traces of [[cocaine]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] in his system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/11/19/entertainment/main584494.shtml|title=Aaliyah Crash Pilot Was on Cocaine|last=Holguín|first=Jaime|date=November 11, 2003|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NTSB reported that the maximum allowed gross weight of the aircraft was "substantially exceeded" and that the center of gravity was positioned beyond its rear limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1448577/20010831/aaliyah.jhtml|title=Report Shows Aaliyah's Plane Was Overloaded|last=Schumacher-Rasmussen|first=Eric|date=August 31, 2001|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=July 2, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090602020549/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1448577/20010831/aaliyah.jhtml| archivedate= June 2, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. joined the investigation on August 27, 2001, as authorities from the NTSB and the FAA arrived in the Bahamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://komonews.com/archive/us-joins-investigation-of-crash-that-killed-aaliyah|title=U.S. Joins Investigations of Crash That Killed Aaliyah|publisher=KOMO News|date=August 27, 2001|accessdate=July 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, the day of Aaliyah's funeral, an independent expert of the Cessna Pilots Association reported that the aircraft was overloaded.

==Remains returned to the United States==
On August 28, 2001, Aaliyah's remains were transported from the Bahamas back to the U.S. Over 100 people waited outside the funeral home in Nassau as four men lifted her coffin into a hearse. It was then taken to the Nassau airport, where a private jet waited to return the body to [[Newark International Airport]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-08-29/news/0108290291_1_marsh-harbour-airport-plane-crash-singer-aaliyah|title=Singer Aaliyah's body returned to U.S.|date=August 29, 2001|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idobi.com/news/2001/08/singer-aaliyahs-body-flown-to-united-states/|title=Singer Aaliyah's Body Flown To United States|work=idobi Network|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A director at the funeral home in Nassau said people started calling in on August 27 to pay their respects. The other victims' bodies were repatriated on August 29. A [[U.S. Embassy]] spokesman reported that Virgin Records America paid the cost of all mortuary services in the Bahamas, the return of the bodies to the U.S., as well as the funerals.&lt;ref name=bodiessunsentinel&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2001-08-29/news/0108280684_1_aaliyah-bodies-respects|title=Crowds Pay Tribute As Bodies Sent Home|date=August 29, 2001|publisher=Sun Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaliyah's family was staying at the [[Trump International Hotel]] when her body was returned. Staff reported flowers and condolences had been sent in steadily since her death. A worker at the reception desk disclosed that at least 500 bouquets, delivered mostly by grieving fans, had arrived for the family in the three days between the crash and the return of her body. Aaliyah's [[publicist]], Jill Fritzo, said the Haughton family was touched by the support they received from fans and reported the condition of the family. "They're hanging in there. It's very tough for them".&lt;ref name=QuestionsNYT /&gt;

Aaliyah's brother Rashad delivered the [[eulogy]] and described his sister as giving him strength. "Aaliyah, you left, but I'll see you always next to me and I can see you smiling through the sunshine," he said. "When our life is over, our book is done. I hope God keeps me strong until I see her again." He read the names of the other victims of the crash and concluded by asking mourners to pray for them as well. As Diane Haughton and the mourners left, they sang Aaliyah's song "[[One in a Million (Aaliyah song)|One in a Million]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/funeral-awash-tears-pink-roses-article-1.921936|title=FUNERAL AWASH WITH TEARS &amp; PINK ROSES|date=September 1, 2001|publisher=New York Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rod Dreher]], a columnist at the ''New York Post'', criticized the funeral for being out of hand. "Right, so we're all sad that Aaliyah is dead, and no one begrudges her a proper sendoff. But a traffic-snarling, horse-drawn cortege in honor of a pop singer most people have never heard of? Give us a break." [[Al Sharpton]] responded to the column by defending the funeral and Aaliyah, questioning how "you determine that one life is not as important as another?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/rev-al-rips-post-aaliyah-rant-article-1.922915|title=REV.

==Criticism of Blackhawk==
Blackhawk International Airways came under scrutiny by the FAA, which reported that the charter service had authorization for limited use of the aircraft to the degree that it was theorized that Morales would normally not have been able to pilot it. In the three years prior to the crash, Blackhawk was cited four times for violations. The company was fined $1,500 in 1998 for violating safety rules in U.S. airspace. It received a warning for not testing employees for drugs in 1999, and was cited in 2000 for failing to comply with maintenance standards.&lt;ref name=QuestionsNYT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/30/us/questions-raised-about-pilot-in-crash-that-killed-singer.html|first=Dana|last=Canedy|title=Questions Raised About Pilot in Crash That Killed Singer|publisher=New York Times|date=August 30, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert Chacon, head of Blackhawk at the time of the crash, pleaded guilty in 1993 to [[bankruptcy fraud]] involving another charter service. There was no evidence that Blackhawk managers had prior knowledge of Chacon's background.&lt;ref name=NYTHastes /&gt;

==Pilot's background==
After the crash, revelations came to light concerning Morales' private life, as well as his activities during the final month before the crash. From an early age, Morales had expressed interest in aviation. His grandfather was a commercial pilot who gave him his first flights at age eleven. Morales began formal flight training at age seventeen at the Isla Grande Flying School at [[Fernando Ribas Dominicci Airport]] in Isla Grande, [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]]. Following the accident, authorities told his relatives not to discuss the case; however, Morales' sister spoke on behalf of the family. "We are confident the investigation is not going to disclose anything that would involve negligence on behalf of my brother. He has vast experience flying planes. He had been doing it since he was 14... They are talking about a person who cannot defend himself."&lt;ref name="Sun-SentinelAugust31"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2001-08-31/news/0108310115_1_multiengine-planes-pilot-s-license-morales-sister|title=Pilot Never Took Risks, Sister Said|publisher=Sun Sentinel|date=August 31, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morales received his pilot's license in February 2000.&lt;ref name=QuestionsNYT /&gt; His job for Blackhawk was his second attempt to work as a commercial pilot since getting his license.&lt;ref name=TheObserver /&gt; In October 2000, he had been turned down for being too inexperienced after applying to Tropic Air of [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]].&lt;ref name=NYTHastes /&gt; [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]] Sheriff’s records showed Morales had been caught with [[crack cocaine]] in his car after being pulled over for driving his car through a stop sign on August 7, 2001; he was booked on a [[felony]] cocaine-possession charge. He was also charged for driving with a suspended license and running a stop sign. The arrest report stated that Morales told officers he was in the area to purchase powder cocaine for a friend.&lt;ref name=CaughtWithCocaine&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1448503/pilot-of-aaliyahs-plane-had-been-caught-with-cocaine-was-not-authorized-to-fly/|title=Pilot Of Aaliyah’s Plane Had Been Caught With Cocaine, Was Not Authorized To Fly|publisher=MTV|date=August 29, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Associated Press]], ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]'' and other news outlets reported allegations that Morales had been sentenced to [[probation]] on August 13, 2001, the result of being found with a small amount of cocaine in his car during the traffic stop. Other reports, such as one by ''[[The New York Times]]'' on September 8, 2001, and another in the Broward County ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'', questioned whether he was qualified to fly the aircraft. Gabriel Penagaricano, a lawyer for the Morales family, dismissed any questions about Morales' flight record as "the words of a fool". He defended Morales as a "young man, totally dedicated to his profession ... [who] had set his sights on flying for one of the major airlines. In the meantime, he was doing what everybody else of his age and experience does, which is to fly for a charter operator in order to build up flying time." Penagaricano claimed Morales was "certainly" qualified to pilot a Cessna 402B.&lt;ref name="Farley173-174"&gt;Farley, p. 173-174.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the crash, Morales was fired as a pilot from Golden Airlines in Florida for failing to appear at work.&lt;ref name=NYTHastes /&gt;

On August 28, 2001, U.S. aviation officials said that Morales had been hired by Blackhawk just two days before the crash, and was not authorized by the FAA to fly the aircraft for the operator. FAA records showed that Blackhawk was clear to fly aircraft under a single-pilot certificate. However, according to Kathleen Bergen, Morales was not on the name authorization papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/brief/770794/aaliyah-s-family-plans-private-funeral-in-new-york|title=Aaliyah's family plans private funeral in New York|first=Erica|last=Gimenes|date=August 30, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergen did not identify the pilot who was on the papers, since "it would not be appropriate" to release it, but confirmed Morales was not qualified to fly the Cessna.&lt;ref name=CaughtWithCocaine /&gt; Morales's father addressed his son's death and responsibility in the crash: "Luis was responsible for nine lives - eight plus his own. Someone is going to have to respond for those eight lives. And someone is going to have to respond for his life to me."&lt;ref name=TheObserver /&gt; He said he had spoken to his son in early August 2001 and the younger Morales related he was doing something he was passionate about.&lt;ref name="Sun-SentinelAugust31" /&gt;

==Lawsuits==
The day of the crash was Morales' first official day with Blackhawk, an FAA Part 135 single-pilot operation. He was not registered with the FAA to fly for Blackhawk and, as a result of the accident, Aaliyah's parents filed a [[wrongful death claim|wrongful death]] lawsuit against the company, which was [[court settlement|settled out of court]] for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,624572,00.html|title=Aaliyah Remembered One Year Later|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M.|date=August 26, 2002|work=People|accessdate=April 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barry &amp; Sons, Inc., a corporation formed in 1992 to develop, promote, and capitalize Aaliyah, and to oversee the production and distribution of her records and music videos, brought an unsuccessful lawsuit in the [[New York Supreme Court]] against Instinct Productions LLC, the company that was hired in August 2001 to produce the music video for "Rock the Boat". The case was dismissed because New York's wrongful death statute permits only certain people related to the deceased to recover damages for wrongful death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1495396/20050107/aaliyah.jhtml|title=Aaliyah's Label Can't Sue Video Producer Who Booked Ill-Fated Flight|last=Rashbaum|first=Alyssa|date=January 7, 2005|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=June 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport|url=http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/3dseries/2005/2005_00096.htm|title=Barry &amp; Sons, Inc. v Instinct Prods.

===Family lawsuits===
The families of Foreman and Dodd filed lawsuits against Virgin Records America, alleging the [[record label]] was negligent in chartering the aircraft that crashed, killing all the passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1452663/families-of-men-killed-in-aaliyah-crash-file-lawsuits/|date=February 28, 2002|publisher=MTV|first=Abbey|last=Goodman|title=Families Of Men Killed In Aaliyah Crash File Lawsuits}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit noted that Blackhawk had been cited four times in the previous four years. At a [[news conference]], attorney Brian Panish charged that the crash victims died instantly because Virgin Records America "put profits over people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/feb/28/business/fi-virgin28|title=Suits Filed in Singer's Crash|first=Ann W.|last=O'Neill|date=February 28, 2002|publisher=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In less than a week, the relatives of Gallin sued Virgin Records America, claiming that the label, and its affiliated music and video production units, were liable for his death because they handled the arrangements for Aaliyah’s video shoot in the Bahamas. Gallin's relatives claimed that the label should have hired a “competent” transportation broker and air charter company, and that Blackhawk allowed the pilot to fly the aircraft even though he was unqualified, and took off with it dangerously overloaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1452719/relatives-of-aaliyahs-bodyguard-suing-for-wrongful-death/|date=March 4, 2002|publisher=MTV|first=Abbey|last=Goodman|title=Relatives Of Aaliyah’s Bodyguard Suing For Wrongful Death}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart Grossman represented the Gallin family during the lawsuit and reasoned that even the pilot did not want to take off because of overloading and called it "outrageous". He added: "This is a case of trying to put a size 12 foot in a size 10 shoe."&lt;ref name=SunSentinel2002&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2002-03-02/news/0203020219_1_aaliyah-blackhawk-international-airways-scott-gallin|title=Aaliyah Plane Crash Spurs Another Lawsuit|work=Sun Sentinel|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diane and Michael Haughton lawsuit===
In May 2002, Aaliyah's parents filed a lawsuit, similar to those filed by the families of Foreman and Dodd, against Virgin Records America in [[Los Angeles]], alleging negligence. Their lawsuit claimed that a "dangerous and unsafe configuration" of the Cessna was the cause of the crash and that it was the "wrong plane" for the charter flight; the [[litigation]] also asserted that Morales was not properly qualified to operate the aircraft. In addition to suing Virgin Records America, the lawsuit named Blackhawk International Airways, music video director Harold Williams, Instinct Productions, Big Dog House Films, Blackground Records LLC, and Skystream. An investigator for the Bahamian Civil Aviation Department stated neither Blackhawk or Skystream had a permit to operate commercial charter flights in the Bahamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1986546.stm|date=May 14, 2002|publisher=BBC|title=Aaliyah's parents sue over plane crash}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2003, the Haughtons' lawyers filed a notice in federal court that the case had been settled with an agreement to keep the monetary details confidential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3092460.stm|date=September 9, 2003|publisher=BBC News|title=Aaliyah parents settle over death}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nassau funeral home===
In August 2002, the funeral home that had prepared the crash victims' bodies publicly accused Virgin Records America of not paying its bill. [[Loretta Butler-Turner]], of Butler's Funeral Homes and Crematorium in Nassau, told [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] that $68,000 was spent preparing the bodies and, at the time, Virgin executives Ken and Nancy Berry agreed to cover all expenses. At the time of Turner's announcement, the Berrys had left the record label. Turner tried to contact executives at Virgin Records, and appealed to the U.S. Embassy in Nassau for help, but failed to resolve the situation. "They have kept us waiting for nearly a year and have basically said, since the Berrys are no longer there, they have no responsibility to us," Turner stated. Although the funeral home did not take legal action, Turner did contact Robert Spragg, the Haughtons' lawyer. According to Spragg, the label also owed the Haughton family money for funeral costs, stating: "Those payments were never made to the family to reimburse those costs, and they were substantial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2190491.stm|title=Aaliyah funeral bill 'unpaid'|date=August 13, 2002|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner spoke to [[E!|E! Online]] news about the case and reflected on how events had unfolded. "Because Aaliyah was, in their words, 'high profile,' they asked us to expedite things. So we were working over the weekend to get the bodies out as quickly as possible," Turner said. "[The deal] was all verbal, but the truth of the matter is, [the Berrys] knew they were obliged. They contacted all of the families themselves, sent us all of the necessary information, and told us not to deal directly with the family members, that they would be responsible."&lt;ref name=E!OnlineAugust2002&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/43719/virgin-dodges-aaliyah-funeral-costs|title=Virgin Dodges Aaliyah Funeral Costs?|publisher=E! Online|date=August 12, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that Aaliyah's parents planned to file a lawsuit against Virgin Records America for not fulfilling its promise to pay Aaliyah's funeral expenses. Turner said she would hold on to the victims' [[death certificate]]s, which were required before estates could be settled or lawsuits could be filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2002/08/12/funeral-home-still-waits-for-aaliyah-payment/|title=Funeral Home Still Waits for Aaliyah Payment|date=August 12, 2002|publisher=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner said she had been unsuccessful in contacting company executives by telephone calls, letters, and [[fax]]es. She said the funeral home had a good relationship with the U.S. Embassy, which, according to her, had supported a potential lawsuit against Virgin Records America since Butler's was a reputable company. "Now this reputable company (Virgin) has kept us waiting for nearly a year and have basically said, since the Berrys are no longer there, they have no responsibility to us. I don't know if they think we are some sort of Third-World banana republic and we're not up to scratch, but it just gives a pretty bad view of things in our view."&lt;ref name=E!OnlineAugust2002 /&gt;

===Ruling on the lawsuit against Instinct Productions===
In May 2004, a judge ruled that Blackground Entertainment, Aaliyah's record company, could sue Instinct Productions, which had provided transportation for the filming of "Rock the Boat." Blackground had filed a negligence lawsuit in civil court against Instinct Productions in November 2003. Instinct Productions argued that Blackground had no right to recover damages since Aaliyah was a company employee. But  Judge Carol Edmead found that Aaliyah was also Blackground's chief asset. She wrote that the company's: "growth and prosperity were primarily the result of its efforts to successfully develop and nurture Aaliyah's career". She noted the company was founded in 1992 by Barry Hankerson for the sole purpose of promoting Aaliyah, who was thirteen at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/29/nyregion/record-company-can-sue-over-popular-singer-s-death.html|title=Record Company Can Sue Over Popular Singer's Death|date=May 29, 2004|first=Susan|last=Saulny|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
Fans of Aaliyah were reportedly grieving in [[New York City]], where the singer had spent the first five years of her life there before relocating to [[Detroit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/29/us/new-york-fans-grieve-over-death-of-aaliyah.html|title=New York Fans Grieve Over Death of Aaliyah|date=August 29, 2001|publisher=New York Times|first=Thomas J.|last=Lueck}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quincy Jones]] told the Associated Press that he was devastated by her death. Tourism minister Turnquest stated: “We find it devastating and most unfortunate that after having this world-famous star Aaliyah and her crew select the Bahamas as their choice location for her latest video, the project has climaxed on such a tragic note”.&lt;ref name="MTV News" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/26/world/singer-aaliyah-among-8-dead-in-plane-crash.html|title=Singer Aaliyah Among 8 Dead In Plane Crash|date=August 26, 2001|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after she died, on August 27, 2001, fans gathered near her former high school to remember her in a [[candlelight vigil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1512938.stm|date=August 28, 2001|publisher=BBC News|title=A vigil for Aaliyah}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August 29, 2001, nearly 6,000 people had emailed [[BBC News]] "expressing shock and sorrow" at her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1515079.stm|date=August 29, 2001|publisher=BBC News|title=Aaliyah tributes flood in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gladys Knight said she felt "blessed" to have known Aaliyah and stated: "I watched her grow up, and, with the rest of the world, saw her achieve success with her special and unique talents". She continued: "From an early age, I knew she had enormous talents, an intrinsic gift. When she first performed with me in Las Vegas, she was still quite young, but she already had it - that spark the world would later see and fall in love with." Silbert Mills, an official on Abaco Island, reported the denizens playing her music there and added: "That's the whole tragedy of it. We felt as if we knew her, yet we didn't."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1513515.stm|date=August 28, 2001|publisher=BBC News|title=Gladys Knight mourns niece Aaliyah}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beyoncé]] praised her good nature and stated: "She was one of the first celebrities we met, she was so nice, we went out, we hung out with her, and it's really sad and we're trying to be strong". [[Lil' Kim]] described the crash as "really devastating" and said she "could never find anything bad about her".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1514499.stm|date=August 29, 2001|publisher=BBC News|title=Aaliyah's body flown home}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[Jet Li]], her co-star from the film ''[[Romeo Must Die]]'', heard of her death and was "deeply saddened that she is no longer with us. She was a wonderful and talented artist who will be missed by everyone whose lives she touched". [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]] called her "talented, classy, warm, beautiful, compassionate, humble."&lt;ref name=BodyBack&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/42083/aaliyah-s-body-returned-home|title=Aaliyah's Body Returned Home|publisher=E! Online|date=August 28, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Damon Dash]] said he was "crushed and heartbroken over the loss of such a beautiful and talented woman whom I loved deeply and meant the world to me." and Combs remembered Aaliyah as "just one of those individuals that would light up a room", adding: "She was very down to earth. She was a special individual...We all saw her grow up from a little girl into a woman. It's a hard, sad day for everyone". [[Ginuwine]] referred to her as family, said he would miss her and offered his condolences to her family, while speaking to the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' from Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/beau-pals-filled-heartache-article-1.919962|date=August 28, 2001|publisher=New York Daily News|title=BEAU, PALS FILLED WITH HEARTACHE}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian McKnight]] complimented Aaliyah as being "really genuine and nice and not jaded about being a star". [[Jill Scott]] said she felt numb over Aaliyah's death given her age, talent and beauty and added, "It hurts, and it's sad, and we'll miss her".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/08/29/aaliyah.colleagues/|title=Colleagues pay tribute to Aaliyah - August 29, 2001|publisher=CNN.com|date=August 29, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, Star, a [[shock jock]] at New York radio station [[Hot 97]], mocked her death by playing a tape of a woman screaming while a crash was heard in the background. Rumors circulated that he was attacked by friends of Aaliyah, which he denied. Star was suspended and expressed remorse for his actions, admitting they were in "poor taste". He said, "I'm trying not to make fun of anything Aaliyah-related right now, because I'm aware people are trying to focus all their anger on me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/star-falls-faster-aaliyah-joke-article-1.929910|title=STAR FALLS FASTER AFTER AALIYAH 'JOKE'|publisher=New York Daily News|date=August 31, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Following Aaliyah's death, there was an increase in sales of her [[Aaliyah (album)|self-titled third album]], which had been released only a month before and had debuted at number two on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'', selling over 187,000 copies in its first week. According to ''[[Nielsen SoundScan|SoundScan]]'', this was more than four times greater than the first-week's sales of her previous effort, 1996's ''[[One in a Million (Aaliyah album)|One in a Million]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/78998/keys-wards-off-aaliyah-foxy-at-no-1|title=Keys Wards Off Aaliyah, Foxy At No. 1|work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was already [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] when she flew to Abaco Island in the Bahamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/aaliyah-1979-2001-20011011|title=Aaliyah Obituary: Remembering the R&amp;B Star - Rolling Stone|work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to her death, lacking a second single and promotion, ''Aaliyah'' was selling slower than her second album. By 2009, the album was estimated to have sold three million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rollingout.com/music/beyonce-vs-aaliyah-fans-believe-couldnt-co-exist/#_|title=Beyonce vs. Aaliyah|first=Stereo|last=Williams|publisher=Rolling Out|date=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the weeks following her death, the album went from number nineteen to number one on the ''Billboard 200'', as retailers reported massive sales after her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/78474/aaliyah-posthumously-tops-album-chart|title=Aaliyah Posthumously Tops Album Chart|work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year in 2002, a compilation album titled ''[[I Care 4 U]]'' was released, featuring six new songs which sold 1.73 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://images.businessweek.com/ss/09/07/0721_posthumous_record_sales/10.htm|title=Artists with the Most Posthumous Album Sales: Aaliyah Dana Haughton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of her death, Aaliyah was working on several film appearances to be released back-to-back. One of these was a [[Sparkle (2012 film)|remake of the 1976 film ''Sparkle'']], produced by [[Whitney Houston]]. Houston would later say that Aaliyah was interested in being in the film to the point of being "enthusiastic". After she died, Houston shelved the project because her lead had "gone to a better place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://popcrush.com/whitney-houston-aaliyah-sparkle/|title=Whitney Houston Discusses Aaliyah and Upcoming Film ‘Sparkle’|date=November 11, 2011|publisher=PopCrush|first=Nadine|last=Cheung}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was later completed in 2011, with [[Jordin Sparks]] replacing Aaliyah. She had filmed part of her role in 2003's ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and was scheduled to appear in its sequel ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]''. [[Nona Gaye]] was recast in the role.

==In popular culture==
Aaliyah's death has been referenced in popular culture numerous times. [[Jay-Z]] did a remix to her song "[[Miss You (Aaliyah song)|Miss You]]" where he spoke to her in the lyric, “What’s up baby girl? You know I had to talk to you again,” before listing the names of people in her life who missed her such as Timbaland, Missy Elliott, and her brother Rashad. He then addressed her relationship with Damon Dash and called her "our little angel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1470560/jay-z-tells-aaliyah-dames-doing-well-missy-misses-her-on-new-remix/|title=Jay-Z Tells Aaliyah Dame's Doing Well, Missy Misses Her On New Remix|publisher=MTV|date=March 14, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music video for "Miss You" featured tributes by Aaliyah's friends and collaborators. The Jay-Z song "[[Glory (Jay-Z song)|Glory]]" mentioned the crash, warning his daughter to exercise safety in the lyric, "Just make sure the plane you’re on is bigger than your carry-on baggage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2012-01-09/beyonces-alleged-miscarriage-aaliyahs-death-and-other-insights-into-jay-zs-new-song-glory-featuring-b-i-c/|title=

''[[Aaliyah: The Princess of R&amp;B]]'', a biopic of Aaliyah's life, does not feature a re-creation of the crash, but does mention her death in text following the final scene where she parts ways with Dash to leave for the Bahamas. The rapper [[J. Cole]] has a line in the third verse of the song "No Role Modelz" which is: "My only regret could never take Aaliyah home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/no-role-modelz-lyrics-j-cole.html | title=No Role Modelz Lyrics | publisher=Metro Lyrics / CBS Interactive | accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kendrick Lamar]] has also mentioned her in the song "Blow my High", in which he sings "R.I.P Aaliyah, R.I.P", the song ends with a sample from Aaliyah's song "[[4 Page Letter]]".

'''Oury Jalloh''' (born 1968 in [[Kabala, Sierra Leone|Kabala]], [[Sierra Leone]];&lt;ref name="source1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/was-geschah-in-zelle-nr-5/3692880.html|title=Tod eines Asylanten - Was geschah in Zelle Nr. 5?|last=Overath|first=Margot|date=7 January 2011|work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|language=German|accessdate=25 March 2011|location=Berlin, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt; died 7 January 2005 in [[Dessau]], [[Germany]]) was an asylum seeker who died in a fire in a police cell in [[Dessau]], Germany. The hands and feet of Jalloh, who was alone in the cell, were tied to a mattress. A fire alarm went off, but was initially turned off without further action by an officer. The case caused national and international outrage.

In 2007, two officers were charged with causing bodily harm with fatal consequences and with involuntary manslaughter, respectively, but were acquitted in December 2008 for lack of evidence. According to the presiding judge, contradictory testimony had prevented clarification of the circumstances and had obstructed due process. The [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]] annulled one of the acquittals, and since January 2011, a different [[Judiciary of Germany|Landgericht]] than before is concerned with the case.

==Life==
According to his tombstone in Sierra Leone, Oury Jalloh was born in 1968.&lt;ref name=film2006&gt;Kolvenbach, Pagonakis (2006): "Tod in der Zelle – Warum starb Oury Jalloh?". Documentary film.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000,&lt;ref name=unterrichtsmaterialien&gt;[http://epizberlin.de/download/Dialogestan/UM_Oury_Jalloh Flucht und Asyl]&lt;/ref&gt; he fled from the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] to [[Guinea]], where his parents were already living, and then further to Germany, where he applied for political asylum.&lt;ref name=source1/&gt; Although his application was declined, he remained in the country. His child with a German citizen was put up for adoption by the mother shortly after birth.&lt;ref name=tagesspiegel-2011-07-30&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/zeitung/wie-starb-oury-jalloh/999260.html Wie starb Oury Jalloh?], Tagesspiegel 2011-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Several weeks before his death, Jalloh was convicted to a prison sentence of three and a half years for commercial drug trafficking.

==Death==
According to the investigators, the fire broke out in the cell around midday. The fire alarm went off on two occasions. Noises and cries for help coming from the acoustically controlled cell were registered but ignored. Supposedly, the supervising police officer turned off the sound of the acoustic system shortly before twelve because he could not understand a telephone conversation. Only when the air-control alarm went off did he go down into the basement where the cell was located. But by that time Jalloh was found lying on a burning mattress, his body severely burned and his hands bound to the bed frame.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wsws.org/articles/2012/jan2012/oury-j11.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of a lighter were only found in later investigations.

==Parallels to the Li Yangjie case==
Chief prosecutor Folker Bittmann for the Oury Jalloh case&lt;ref name="Leitender Oberstaatsanwalt Folker Bittmann"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uni-giessen.de/fbz/fb01/professuren/rotsch/ccc/praxisgruppe/bittmann|title=Leitender Oberstaatsanwalt Folker Bittmann|author=University Giessen|work=University Giessen|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also responsible for the [[Yangjie Li]] case, a 25-year-old Chinese architecture student murdered near her student accommodation in Dessau. During the course of the police investigation, the suspect's police parents fell into general suspicion of having covered up the evidences. Bittmann's spread of the version of the suspects' testimony that the victim had "consensual sex" with them at a press conference{{what|date=August 2017}} also caused outrage among the victim's parents, Chinese students in Dessau and throughout the country.

'''Deathlok''' (also referred to as '''Deathlok the Demolisher''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #25 (Aug. [[1974 in comics|1974]]), created by [[Rich Buckler]] and [[Doug Moench]]. At least three subsequent Marvel characters have used the "Deathlok" identity since then. A recurring theme among these characters is that a [[undead|dead human]] has been [[reanimated]] with [[cybernetic]] technology.  "Deathlok technology" has also been used thematically by Marvel writers in other stories. The character has also appeared on television in animation and live action.

==Publication history==
Although initially announced as the new lead feature for Marvel's ''[[Worlds Unknown]]'' comic, under the title "Cyborg",&lt;ref&gt;"Far-Out Fanfare and Infoomation!", ''[[FOOM]]'', November 1973, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; the first Deathlok series ran in  ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #25-28, 30-36 ([[cover-date]]d Aug. 1974 - July 1976). This initial version of the character, '''Luther Manning''', later guest-starred with [[Spider-Man]] in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #46 (June 1976), and the story from the cancelled ''Astonishing Tales'' comics was finished in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #33 (April 1977).

Deathlok subsequently appeared with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], a member of the superhero team the [[Fantastic Four]], in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #26, 27, 28, 34 and #54, although one appearance was actually a robot and not the genuine Deathlok. The Luther Manning Deathlok then appeared in ''[[Captain America]]'' #286-288 (Oct.-Dec. 1983).

A new Deathlok, '''Michael Collins''', debuted in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Deathlok'' #1-4 (July-Oct. 1990, reprinted as ''Deathlok Special'' #1-4 the following year). He was the second Deathlok to be created in the modern era and also the second to be created for the traditional [[Marvel Universe]]. This second Deathlok went on to a 34-issue series cover-dated July 1991 to April 1994, plus two [[annual publication|summer annuals]] in 1992 and 1993.

The third Deathlok, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] espionage agent '''Jack Truman''', debuted in an 11-issue limited series (Sept. 1999 - June 2000).

Deathlok has also appeared in four issues of the limited series ''[[Beyond!]]'', and Michael Collins, in human form and not as Deathlok, appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #544-545 (May–June 2007). Multiple unnamed Deathlok units appear in ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'' vol. 4, #1-6. Possessing no human sentience, they were automatons created from corpses of soldiers killed in [[Iraq]].

A new Deathlok named '''Henry Hayes''' debuted during the ''[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]'' event from [[Nathan Edmondson]] and [[Mike Perkins]]. While the character was considered to be an adaptation of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] portrayal of Deathlok, Mike Petersen, Edmondson stated that the coincidences were just "happy similarities" and that ultimately they tried to go for a total original concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsarama.com/21378-writer-promises-new-old-deathlok-in-new-ongoing-series.html|title=Writer Promises New &amp; Old DEATHLOK In New Ongoing Series|website=Newsarama|last=Arrant|first=Chris|date=June 18, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Deathlok has his own ongoing series that began in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/50984/deathlok_2014_1|title=Deathlok (2014) #1|author=|date=|website=marvel.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
===Luther Manning===
Colonel Luther Manning is an American soldier from [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], who, after being fatally injured, is reanimated in a post-apocalyptic future (originally given the date of 1990) only to discover that what remains of his dead body has been turned into the experimental Deathlok [[cyborg]] by Simon Ryker. He verbally communicates with his symbiotic computer, to which he refers as the abbreviated "'Puter". He escapes from Ryker's control,&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing Tales'' #25 (Aug. 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; although he dreams he has regained his humanity.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Fanfare'' #4 (Sept. 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; He battles the evil corporate and military regimes that have taken over the [[United States]], while simultaneously struggling not to lose his humanity. He battles Simon Ryker and the first [[Warwolf (Marvel Comics)|War-Wolf]], and encounters his wife and son for the first time after becoming a cyborg.&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing Tales'' #26-27 (Oct. &amp; Dec. 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; He battles Simon Ryker's Super-Tank,&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing Tales'' #28, 30 (Feb. &amp; June 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; and then begins a hunt for a "cyborg doctor".&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing Tales'' #32 (Nov. 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; He battles Simon Ryker as the Savior Machine, and his mind is ultimately transferred into a Luther Manning clone.&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing Tales'' #33-35 (Jan.-May 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; He battles mutants alongside a time-traveling [[Spider-Man]].&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Team-Up'' #46 (June 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; He begins working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], encounters Godwulf for the first time, and is then finally sent back in time to the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing Tales'' #36 (July 1976); final issue of the series&lt;/ref&gt;

He battles the [[Devil-Slayer]], but then battles demons alongside Devil-Slayer.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Spotlight'' #33 (April 1977)&lt;/ref&gt; He later becomes controlled by [[Mentallo]] and the [[Fixer (comics)#Fixer/Techno|Fixer]] and is sent to assassinate the President, but is stopped by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Nick Fury]].&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Two-in-One'' #26-27 (April–May 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;  After his capture he becomes catatonic, and is taken to England for treatment by the Thing.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Two-in-One'' #28 (June 1977)&lt;/ref&gt; He is cured by Louis Knort, and Nick Fury takes him into custody.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Two-in-One'' #54 (Aug. 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

Deathlok is rebuilt by [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]] as a robot and sent to sabotage [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Government agencies|Project Pegasus]]. The robot battles the Thing and [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]], and self-destructs.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Two-in-One'' #54&lt;/ref&gt; The real Deathlok, now working for the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Brand Corporation]], battles [[Captain America]] and a time-traveling Luther Manning clone.  Alongside Captain America, Godwulf, and the Redeemers, he battles Hellinger.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #286-288&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time later, the [[Earth-616|"mainstream timeline"]] Luther Manning begins dreaming that he is Deathlok.&lt;ref&gt;''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #25-26&lt;/ref&gt; He is charged with temporal energy by Timestream.&lt;ref&gt;''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #27&lt;/ref&gt; Timestream recruits this "mainstream" human Manning.&lt;ref&gt;''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #29&lt;/ref&gt; Deathlok, Timestream, and Manning battled the Collins Deathlok, [[Siege (John Kelly)|Siege]], and Godwulf.&lt;ref&gt;''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #31-34&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manning Deathlok eventually returns to his own time and overthrows the megalomaniac who had taken over the country. Manning remains in his near-future alternate reality, searching for a purpose in life and unable to disconnect himself from the machine bonded to him.

Eventually, Manning travels to the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]] and encounters [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. He lives a life of solitude until being apprehended by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], from which he is later kidnapped by the supervillain [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] and, immobilized, put up for auction as a weapon. Before a sale can be completed, he is stolen by the crime lord [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] and sent on a [[kamikaze]] decoy run.

===John Kelly===
Kelly first appeared as Deathlok in ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #62. This version of Deathlok was originally controlled by Kelly until its systems determined that Kelly's brain function was detrimental to its completion of the "First Run" program. The Deathlok unit then completed its mission. Kelly's brain was removed from the cyborg and disposed of. One of Ryker's assistants took the brain presumably for use in the SIEGE unit. This version was made for the [[United States Army]] by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s Deathlok-program co-head, Harlan Ryker, after studying Luther Manning's cyborg body. The Kelly Deathlok later became known as [[Siege (John Kelly)|Siege]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Gregory; ''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #19 (Jan. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michael Collins===
Professor Michael Collins was born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  He was a pacifist working for the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]] cybernetics corporation Cybertek. Upon discovery of the Deathlok program he was shot with a sedative by Harlan Ryker and his brain was transplanted into the body of the [[Siege (John Kelly)|John Kelly]] Deathlok Cyborg. The machine was used against rebels fighting against Roxxon's influence in the fictional South American country of Estrella. Collins regained his consciousness during that mission and stopped the cyborg programming that would have killed a small child.

Although his brain was intended to serve only as a medium for the robot's programming, he was able to assert his will over it (installing a "no-killing parameter" into its programming).&lt;ref name=one&gt;''Deathlok''  #1 (July 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; The computer is fully willing to listen to Collins, though he must take care to present his orders in a way that helps fulfill the mission and keep people from dying. The computer is fully capable of understanding distinct concepts, such as bluffing, as when Collins is forced to pretend to take a hostage.

He met Jesus Badalamente and also battles Mainframe.&lt;ref&gt;''Deathlok'' #2 (Aug. 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins learns that his human body was still alive, and encounters [[Nick Fury]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]&lt;ref&gt;''Deathlok'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; Harlan Ryker hides Collins's human body. Collins aids Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. in preventing a nuclear strike on the United States.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

With the [[Fantastic Four]], [[X-Men]], and [[Misty Knight]], Deathlok later battles Mechadoom.&lt;ref&gt;''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #2-5 (Aug.-Nov. 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; He meets the [[Punisher]], and battles [[Silvermane]].&lt;ref&gt;''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #6-7 (Dec. 1991 - Jan. 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; After that he teams up with [[Spider-Man]] and several other heroes to stop the [[Sinister Six]].&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man'' #18-23 (Jan. 1992 - Jun. 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; He next meets [[Moses Magnum]].&lt;ref&gt;''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #11 (May 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Collins finally reveals his existence as a cyborg to his family.&lt;ref&gt;''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #12 (June 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins then begins to search for his human body. During this time he fought [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalker]],&lt;ref&gt;''Sleepwalker'' #8 (January 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and helps [[Silver Sable]] retrieve a purloined Statue of Liberty.&lt;ref&gt;''Silver Sable and the Wild Pack'' # 6 &amp; 7 (November &amp; December 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; He assists a makeshift team of other heroes in the "[[Maximum Carnage]]" incident, protecting the people of New York from a mass-murdering group of supervillains.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #379 &amp; 380, ''Spider-Man'' #36 &amp; 37, ''Web of Spider-Man'' #103 &amp; ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #203 (July &amp; August 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the events of the series ''[[Beyond!]]'', the cosmic being [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] (pretending to be the [[Beyonder]]) transported Collins to an alien planet where he was forced to live for years until being rescued with the aid of several other heroes. However, his rescue required the sacrifice of Greg Willis, the superhero known as [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]]. As an act of gratitude, Collins arranged Gravity's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;McDuffie, Dwayne ''[[Beyond!]]'' #s 2-6 (July-Dec. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  When Willis' body was later stolen by the cosmic entity known as Epoch, Collins enlisted the aid of the [[Fantastic Four]] in retrieving it.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #544-546 (May–July 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jack Truman/Larry Young===
Jack Truman was an agent of the international espionage outfit [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] who was transformed into a cyborg to battle the [[Red Skull]]. Through telepathic means, he eventually swapped his mind into the body of another former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, '''Larry Young'''. Young is being considered as a "potential recruit" for the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]] program.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Flamini|Flamini, Anthony]] &amp; Byrd, Ronald; ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''; March 2007; Page 62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Project: Deathlok===
During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, a [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] strikeforce consisting of corpses animated with crude bionics was sent to capture a super-soldier research center known as "[[Weapon Plus|The World]]". These models acted like traditional zombies, craving brains. Their mission was unsuccessful, and as a result, the research group which produced them, "Project: Deathlok", was scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Reign The List: Wolverine'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deathlok Prime===
[[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s rogue ops team joins an alternate future Deathlok-Prime - now free from its homicidal human host's brain - to face down invaders from a different possible future where X-Force, and all other superheroes, have been turned into "Deathloks" controlled by worldly authorities with popular support, which produces a crime-free [[utopia]] for everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #5, 6, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Deathlok appeared later as a guest speaker for one of Jean Grey School for Higher Learning's classes.  Deathlok revealed the potential futures of the students present and the probabilities of them occurring. Notably, Deathlok refused to comment on Genesis' future, revealing to him in private that only he can choose his fate.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #4, March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death Locket===
{{Main|Death Locket}}
In the ''[[Avengers Arena]]'' series as part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, a female teenage version of Deathlok dubbed Death Locket is introduced. She is revealed to be Rebecca Ryker, the daughter of Harlan Ryker. After being maimed in an explosion that killed her mother and brother, Rebecca was rebuilt using the Deathlok technology that her father developed.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] later kidnaps her alongside the students of the [[Avengers Academy]] and Braddock Academy and forces them to fight other teenage superhumans in his latest version of Murderworld.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Henry Hayes===
A new Deathlok debuted during the ''[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]'' storyline. Henry Hayes worked at [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders]]. During his duty, he lost a leg in a suicide bomber attack in Kandahar (or was brainwashed into thinking he did), Henry was taken care of by the company Biotek who provided him with a composite fiber prosthesis. Upon being placed under mind-control, Henry Hayes became Deathlok where he was used as an assassin, a soldier, a killer, a fighter, and an operative. He had participated in at least one armed conflict alongside organized troops, and assassinated countless people even in populated areas. He was even once close to being captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. when a mission went bad in Russia. Henry Hayes was often memory-wiped and did not remember his assignments. While at MTA Metro-North station, he tried to engage discussion with another leg amputee and advised him to contact Biotek, as his own prosthesis (plastic ones as it was the only his pension afforded him) forced the man to use crutches. This man left, seemingly displeased with the discussion. Immediately afterward, he met Seth Horne, an off duty S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who was present when the Eye of the Watcher exploded, releasing a blast of energy which revealed deep secrets to anyone in its radius. To Horne it revealed Hayes' true story. This level four agent wanted to congratulate him, stating that S.H.I.E.L.D. would wish to have him in their ranks. As Henry Hayes really did not know what Horne was talking about, he threatened to call the authorities forcing the agent to leave after a last congratulations. Immediately, Henry Hayes was ordered to kill him as the announcement board of the station indicated the words "Whiskey David" triggering Henry Hayes' Deathlok persona. After following Seth Horne into the restroom Deathlok quickly executed him, left, took some medications, and returned to his civilian life heading to the train to join his daughter Aria.&lt;ref&gt;''Original Sins'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jemma Simmons===
{{Main|Jemma Simmons (comics)}}
In the ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' comic book, Jemma Simmons (based on the character from [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|TV show of the same name]]) became the newest Deathlok, though she has yet to actually take the name. She becomes one after getting infected with an unknown substance contained within a "targeted DNA bomb" that begins to deteriorate her condition which also placed her in a coma. With the help of Henry Hayes and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Bobbi Morse]], she is transformed into a Deathlok which successfully saves her life.&lt;ref&gt;''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2009}}

===Manning===
Col. Luther Manning's body was rebuilt into a cyborg body by Harlan Ryker. Deathlok's mechanical, cybernetic physiology granted him several superhuman powers including superhuman strength, stamina, agility, reflexes, and a computer augmented brain. The right arm and left half of his face are armored cybernetic implants. He wears a woven metal-mesh body suit of considerable durability. Deathlok also carried a helium-neon laser pistol designed by the U.S. Army of his time, and a throwing dagger.

Manning was a military academy graduate, and a brilliant military strategist. He is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, and proficient with knives, daggers, handguns, and laser pistols.

He was later captured and upgraded by 616's S.H.I.E.L.D. and given jet boots that allowed him to leap at great heights and his other abilities were perhaps enhanced to greater levels.

===Collins===
Michael Collins' human brain was transplanted into a cyborg body by a group of scientists at Cybertek. His cyborg body grants him the same powers as Manning, only with much greater strength, speed, and resistance to injury. He possesses a broad spectrum of visual and auditory powers. Deathlok has the ability to interface with virtually any computer system. He is also able to project his consciousness and sensory projections directly into the Net, making him capable of directly hacking computer systems far more efficiently than a traditional hacker. His body can also target (nearly infallibly) multiple objects and track them. He could scan the entire electromagnetic spectrum, as well as enter computer systems. He has learned to use internal nano-bots to repair and alter both his organic and inorganic parts, enabling him to appear as either a humanoid cyborg, or completely human.

He also has a very sophisticated A.I., capable of quickly making complex strategies and evaluating their chance of success. If requested, the A.I. can take control of the body to perform these operations. Collins himself possesses no combat skills, but under computer-guided combat routines, he is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant with an extensive database of combat techniques and strategies.

Collins is an excellent computer programmer with an advanced degree in computer science and prosthetics, and helped construct the Deathlok body, along with other Cybertek scientists including William Hansen, Ben Jacobs, Stanley Cross, Dr. Hu, and Jim Dworman.  After becoming Deathlok, Collins later modified his own systems.

Like Manning, Collins wears a woven metal-mesh body suit of considerable durability. He carries a plasma pistol which draws its energy from his internal power source. Thus, the weapon can only be fired if in contact with the outlets in Deathlok's hand. Deathlok also possesses a collapsible plasma rifle capable of greater firepower with the same limitations, a supply of fragmentation plasma grenades, and a molybdenum steel knife. He wears a wrist bracelet that allows Deathlok to override similar cybernetic operating systems, and an [[adamantium]]/[[vibranium]] alloy shock dampening helmet. He sometimes uses a refitted Cybertek Dragonfly fighter with a range of several hundred miles.

==Other versions==
===Mutant X===
In the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' reality, Deathlok is a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mutant X'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultimate Marvel===
In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #70 (Feb. 2005), the [[Ultimates]] fight a person they refer to as Luther Manning, who looks like Deathlok and whom [[Spider-Man]] describes as a "half-robot half-zombie guy". The superheroes take him into custody.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #70&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Factor===
In ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #231 (Apr. 2012), in a version of reality where [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]] declared "no more humans" instead of "no more mutants", Tony Stark is attacked by a mostly-cyborg version of Steve Rogers, who refers to himself as Deathlok.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #231&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Television===
* In an episode of ''[[Black Panther (TV series)|Black Panther]]'', a team of Deathloks are sent to "assist" Wakanda from an invasion by a neighboring country backed by [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] and his allies with the true objective to coerce or otherwise foster a regime friendly to an American agenda. They arrive in time, but are sent back by the Black Panther.
* The Deathlok concept is adapted for the television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', which is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. The show's Deathlok is '''Mike Peterson''' (played by [[J. August Richards]]) who is introduced in the show's pilot episode. Mike was an ordinary man who received superhuman strength and other attributes from a drug created by Project Centipede after being injured during his job. [[Phil Coulson]]'s team manage to save his life and avert civilian casualties after he goes into a violent rage, and later Mike joins S.H.I.E.L.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Pilot|series=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|credits=Whedon, Joss (director); Joss Whedon, Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen (writer)|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|airdate=September 24, 2013|season=1|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on a later mission, Mike is severely injured and is captured by Project Centipede,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Bridge|series=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|credits=Dale, Holly (director); Shalisha Francis (writer)|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|airdate=December 10, 2013|season=1|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is in fact a division of [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] and converted into a cyborg who is forced to do their bidding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Magical Place|series=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|credits=Hooks, Kevin (director); Paul Zbyszewski &amp; Brent Fletcher (writer)|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|airdate=January 7, 2014|season=1|number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is eventually saved from Hydra by Coulson's team, and helps to prevent Hydra from creating an army of Deathloks.

Deathlok attends Fitz and Simmons' wedding, but announces that he is leaving as he prefers going solo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Real Deal|series=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|credits=Tancharoen, Kevin (director); Jed Whedon &amp; Maurissa Tancharoen &amp; Jeffrey Bell (writer)|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|airdate=March 9, 2018|season=5|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A variation of Deathlok appears in the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode "Deathlok", voiced by [[Mark Hildreth (actor)|Mark Hildreth]].&lt;ref name="Deathlok"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Deathlok|series=Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.|network=Disney XD|season=1|number=21|airdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this show, Deathlok is a cyborg from the future in which the Skrulls' plan for Earth succeeded and Deathlok was one of the few remaining humans left. He was turned into a cyborg and sent to the present, but he cannot return to his own time. He teleports into a mall where he targets a woman only to end up fighting the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. where Deathlok claims that she is no girl. She-Hulk discovers that Deathlok was right about the girl who happens to be [[Super-Skrull]] in disguise as the other people in the mall are revealed to be Skrulls preparing for the Skrull invasion of Earth. Deathlok tells the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. that this date on Earth would be the day when the Skrulls eradicate the human race and terraform Earth to settle on it. After Hulk defeats Super-Skrull, Deathlok activates his self-destruct as She-Hulk takes out Deathlok's core which destroys the ship. She-Hulk was able to put a new core made by Iron Man into Deathlok where the mall flier was part of Deathlok's way to inform the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. about the Skrulls' plot. In the episode "Planet Monster" Pt. 2, Deathlok is among the superheroes that help the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. and the Avengers in their fight against the forces of the [[Supreme Intelligence]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2129">'''Decision lists''' are a representation for Boolean functions which can be easily learnable from examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ronald L. Rivest|authorlink=Ronald L. Rivest|title=Learning decision lists|journal=Machine Learning|volume=2|issue=3|pages=229–246|date=Nov 1987|doi=10.1023/A:1022607331053|url=http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/Riv87b.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Single term decision lists are more expressive than [[Logical disjunction|disjunctions]] and [[conjunctions]]; however, 1-term decision lists are less expressive than the general [[disjunctive normal form]] and the [[conjunctive normal form]].

The language specified by a k-length decision list includes as a subset the language specified by a k-depth [[decision tree]].

Learning decision lists can be used for [[attribute efficient learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam R. Klivans and Rocco A. Servedio, "Toward Attribute Efficient Learning of Decision Lists and Parities", ''Journal of Machine Learning Research'' '''7''':12:587-602 [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1248567&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=DL&amp;CFID=344844478&amp;CFTOKEN=13074001 ACM Digital Library] [http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume7/klivans06a/klivans06a.pdf full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

A decision list (DL) of length {{mvar|r}} is of the form:

 '''if''' {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} '''then''' 
   output {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}
 '''else if''' {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} '''then'''
   output {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}
 ...
 '''else if''' {{mvar|f&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}} '''then'''
   output {{mvar|b&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}}

where {{mvar|f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the {{mvar|i}}th formula and {{mvar|b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the {{mvar|i}}th [[Boolean data type|boolean]] for &lt;math&gt;i \in \{1...r\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The last if-then-else is the default case, which means formula {{mvar|f&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}} is always equal to true. A {{mvar|k}}-DL is a decision list where all of formulas have at most {{mvar|k}} terms.  Sometimes "decision list" is used to refer to a 1-DL, where all of the formulas are either a variable or its [[negation]].

Rabbi '''Ephraim ben Israel Alnaqua''' (1359-1442)&lt;ref name="AlloucheLaloum1987"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean-Luc Allouche|author2=Jean Laloum|title=Les Juifs d'Algérie: images et textes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JK4rAAAAMAAJ|year=1987|publisher=Editions du Scribe|isbn=978-2-86765-008-6|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-he|אפרים בן ישראל אלנאקוה|Efrayim ben Yisra'el 'alnakuvah}}) (also, "Al-Nakawa", "Al-Nakava", "Ankava", "Ankoa", "Enkaoua", "Alnucawi", etc., [[Hebrew]]: "נקוה", "אלנאקוה", "אנקווה", "אנקאווא") was a physician, rabbi, theological writer, and founder of the Jewish community at [[Tlemçen]] (Algeria), where he died in 1442.

According to a legend, Alnaqua escaped from the [[Spanish Inquisition]], which had martyred his father (rabbi Israel Ben Joseph)&lt;ref name="AlloucheLaloum1987" /&gt; and mother at the stake, and came to Tlemcen mounted on a lion, using a serpent as a halter. [[Chaim Yosef David Azulai|Azulai]] refers to him as a miracle-worker. Alnaqua succeeded, after all other physicians had failed, in curing the only daughter of a king of the [[Zayyanid dynasty]]. Refusing the reward of gold and silver offered him by the king, he begged only that the Jews living near Tlemçen might be united in it. In this way the community was formed. Alnaqua's first care was to establish a large synagogue: this is {{As of|1906|alt=still in existence}}, and bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jewish Folklore and Ethnology Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGnYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA85|year=1990|publisher=Simon Bronner|page=85|id=IND:30000046694455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above the rabbi's chair, on which the verse [[Book of Jeremiah|Jer.]] xvii.12 is engraved, a lamp burns perpetually. Alnaqua's grave, surrounded by those of his family, is in the old cemetery: it is sacred to North African Jews, and {{As of|1906|alt=is frequently visited}} by pilgrims from all [[French Algeria|Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersrow.com/Volume_1_The_Universal_Jewish_/ALMS/eBookshukBooks/shid1_bid2874_fid31_pid1_pg210.htm?ebook=1&amp;bmnta=ALMS|title=Volume 1, The Universal Jewish Encyclopedia - eBook - free preview|first=(C)2001-2017, Varda Graphics,|last=support@publishersrow.com|website=www.publishersrow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alnaqua had two sons, Israel and Judah. The latter lived at Oran, [[Mostaganem]], and, later, at Tlemçen, and became the father-in-law of [[Simeon ben Zemah Duran]]. Alnaqua wrote for his elder son Israel ''Shaar Kevod Adonai'' (Entrance to the Glory of God), containing answers to the criticisms of [[Nahmanides]] on the ''Moreh'' of [[Maimonides]]. Manuscripts of this work exist in the [[Bodleian Library]], Oxford. He wrote, also, some hymns.

'''''Ferret Monogatari: Watashi no Okini Iri''''' (''Ferret Story: My Dear Ferret'') is a [[Japan]]-only [[video game]] for [[Game Boy Color]] created by [[Culture Brain]]. Ferret Monogatari is a [[simulation]] style game in which you take care of a [[ferret]].

At the start you choose one of three different coloured ferrets. The colours are randomly chosen. 

The ferret is kept in the cage much of the time. You have to keep its water and food topped up, and clean its [[litter box]]. You can take your ferret out for walks or to play with. You can even play minigames. One is a [[Racing|race]], one is putting together a picture and the other is dancing.

Despite the popularity of ferrets in other countries, especially [[United States|America]], this game was never released outside Japan. This may have been due to lack of popularity in Japan.

The '''follicular phase''' is the phase of the [[estrous cycle]], (or, in humans and [[great ape]]s, the [[menstrual cycle]]) during which [[ovarian follicle|follicles]] in the [[ovary]] mature. It ends with [[ovulation]]. The main hormone controlling this stage is [[estradiol]]. There are several steps in the process of follicular development that occur in the follicular phase: Initiation, Recruitment and progression, Pre-ovulatory maturation and Ovulation. These processes occur in different areas of the body and will be briefly explained below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bagnell, C | title = Animal Reproduction | publisher = Rutgers University Department of Animal Sciences | year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hormonal events==

===Follicle recruitment===
[[File:Follicular phase diagram - early and late.png|thumb|361x361px|Figure 2. Follicular phase diagram of hormones and their origins]]
[[Follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) is secreted by the [[anterior pituitary]] [[gland]] (Figure 2).  FSH secretion begins to rise in the last few days of the previous menstrual cycle,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279054/|title=Endotext|last=Reed|first=Beverly G.|last2=Carr|first2=Bruce R.|date=2000|publisher=MDText.com, Inc.|editor-last=De Groot|editor-first=Leslie J.|location=South Dartmouth (MA)|pmid=25905282|editor-last2=Chrousos|editor-first2=George|editor-last3=Dungan|editor-first3=Kathleen|editor-last4=Feingold|editor-first4=Kenneth R.|editor-last5=Grossman|editor-first5=Ashley|editor-last6=Hershman|editor-first6=Jerome M.|editor-last7=Koch|editor-first7=Christian|editor-last8=Korbonits|editor-first8=Márta|editor-last9=McLachlan|editor-first9=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is highest and most important during the first week of the follicular phase&lt;ref name="silverthorn"&gt;{{cite book | author = Dee Unglaub Silverthorn | title = Human physiology: an integrated approach | publisher = Pearson/Benjamin Cummings | location = San Francisco | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-13-102015-3 | edition = Third | pages = Chapter 26: Reproduction and Development, and Chapter 23 Endocrine control of growth and metabolism | nopp = true }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Figure 1).  The rise in FSH levels recruits five to seven tertiary-stage [[ovarian follicle]]s (this stage follicle is also known as a ''Graafian follicle'' or ''[[Follicular antrum|antral]] follicle'') for entry into the menstrual cycle. These follicles, that have been growing for the better part of a year in a process known as [[folliculogenesis]], compete with each other for dominance.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, E.A., &amp; Hsueh, A.J. (2000). Initial and cyclic recruitment of ovarian follicles. Endocrine Reviews, 200-214, 21(2). doi: 10.1210/edrv.21.2.0394&lt;/ref&gt;

FSH induces the proliferation of [[granulosa cell]]s in the developing follicles, and the expression of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) receptors on these granulosa cells (Figure 1).  Under the influence of FSH, [[aromatase]] and [[p450]] enzymes are activated, causing the granulosa cells to begin to secrete [[estrogen]].  This increased level of estrogen stimulates production of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH), which increases production of LH.&lt;ref name="silverthorn" /&gt;  LH induces [[androgen]] synthesis by [[Theca of follicle|thecal cells]], stimulates proliferation, differentiation, and secretion of follicular thecal cells and increases LH receptor expression on granulosa cells.&lt;ref name="silverthorn" /&gt;

Throughout the entire follicular phase, rising estrogen levels in the blood stimulates growth of the [[endometrium]] and [[myometrium]] of the [[uterus]].&lt;ref name=vander678&gt;{{cite book|last=Strang|first=Eric P. Widmaier, Hershel Raff, Kevin T.|title=Vander's human physiology the mechanisms of body function|year=2006|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston|isbn=0-07-111677-X|pages=678|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also causes endometrial cells to produce receptors for [[progesterone]],&lt;ref name=vander678 /&gt; which helps prime the endometrium to respond to rising levels of progesterone during the late proliferative phase and throughout the luteal phase.

===Estrogen surge===
Two or three days before LH levels begin to increase,&lt;ref name="tcoyf"&gt;{{cite book|title=Taking Charge of Your Fertility|last=Weschler|first=Toni|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2002|isbn=0-06-093764-5|edition=Revised|location=New York|pages=359–361}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually by day seven of the cycle,&lt;ref name="sdhm"&gt;{{cite book | author = Stenchever Droegemuller Herbst Mishell| title = Comprehensive Gynecology | publisher = Mosby | location = St. Louise, Missouri | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-323-01402-X | edition = Fourth | page = 87 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one (or occasionally two) of the recruited follicles has emerged as dominant.  Many endocrinologists believe that the estrogen secretion of the dominant follicle has increased to a level that GnRH production is suppressed, which lowers the levels of LH and FSH.  This slowdown in LH and FSH production leads to the ''atresia'' (death) of most of the recruited follicles, though the dominant follicle continues to mature.  Estrogen levels will continue to increase for several days (on average, six days, but this varies widely).&lt;ref name="tcoyf" /&gt;

These high estrogen levels initiate the formation of a new layer of [[endometrium]] in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium.  Crypts in the [[cervix]] are also stimulated to produce fertile [[cervical mucus]].&lt;ref name="tcoyf" /&gt;  This mucus reduces the acidity of the [[vagina]], creating a more hospitable environment for [[spermatozoon|sperm]].&lt;ref&gt;Weschler (2002), p.57&lt;/ref&gt;  It also has a characteristic texture that helps guide sperm through the cervix&lt;ref&gt;Weschler (2002), illustrations p.59 and p.3 of color insert&lt;/ref&gt; and to the [[fallopian tube]]s, where they wait for ovulation.{{mcn|date=December 2017}}  In addition, [[basal body temperature]] may lower slightly under the influence of high estrogen levels.&lt;ref&gt;Weschler (2002), pp.54,306,310&lt;/ref&gt;

===LH surge and ovulation===
Estrogen levels are highest right before the LH surge begins (Figure 1).  The short-term drop in steroid hormones between the beginning of the LH surge and the event of ovulation may cause mid-cycle spotting or bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;Weschler (2002), p.65&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the influence of the preovulatory LH surge, the first [[meiosis|meiotic]] division of the [[oocytes]] is completed.  The surge also initiates luteinization of thecal and granulosa cells.&lt;ref name="silverthorn" /&gt;  Ovulation normally occurs 30 (± 2) hours after the beginning of the LH surge (when LH is first detectable in urine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Susan B. Bullivant | title= Women's sexual experience during the menstrual cycle: identification of the sexual phase by noninvasive measurement of luteinizing hormone | journal=[[Journal of Sex Research]]|date=February 2004 | volume=41 | issue=1 | pages=82–93 | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2372/is_1_41/ai_n6032944 | pmid=15216427 | doi= 10.1080/00224490409552216 | author2= Sarah A.

==Follicular waves==
Follicular waves are best described as the phase of when the follicular had matured sufficiently, therefore, ruptures and ovulation can commence [1]. In addition, those of the single follicles that mature until they rupture to release the egg during ovulation. Recent findings into the menstrual cycle in mammals has discovered that 2 or more follicles can develop but only one of the follicles fully matures to release the egg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=A.

'''Gabriel Brown''' (1910–1972) was an [[United States|American]] [[Piedmont blues]] [[singing|singer]] and [[guitarist]].&lt;ref name="AMG"/&gt;

==Biography==
Brown was born in [[Florida]], probably in [[Gadsden County]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6ZNfAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=%22GABRIEL+BROWN%22.+%22DROWNED%22.+%221972%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22GABRIEL%20BROWN%22.%20%22DROWNED%22.%20%221972%22&amp;f=false |title=Blues: A Regional Experience|author1=Eagle, Bob L.|author2=LeBlanc, Eric S. |publisher=Praeger|location= Santa Barbara, California |date=2013 |isbn=9780313344244}}&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated from the Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College. In 1934, he performed at the first [[National Folk Festival (USA)|National Folk Festival]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. He was musically discovered by [[Folkloristics|folklorist]] [[Zora Neale Hurston]]. She enlisted [[Alan Lomax]], who recorded Brown for the [[Library of Congress]] in June 1935.&lt;ref name="AMG"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p184669/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Gabriel Brown: Biography |author=Chadbourne, Eugene |publisher=[[Allmusic]].com |accessdate=February 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bastin"&gt;{{cite book

Like [[Ralph Willis (blues musician)|Ralph Willis]], [[Alec Seward]] and [[Brownie McGhee]], Brown then relocated from the [[Southern United States|South]] to [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="russell"&gt;{{cite book

By the late 1930s, Brown performed as a singer on [[Cincinnati]] radio and took part in the show ''St. Louis Woman''. He found employment with the [[civil service]], working for the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Army Signal Corps]] in [[Asbury Park, New Jersey]]. His first full recording session was in 1943, [[record producer|produced]] by [[Joe Davis (music publisher)|Joe Davis]], and the twosome worked together until Brown's final sessions in 1952.&lt;ref name="AMG"/&gt;

In 1945 Brown sang, "I can't have no luck at all, the jinx is on me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art61162.asp
|title=Folklore and Mythology Site |author=Burns, Phyllis Doyle |date= |work= |publisher=Bellaonline.com |accessdate=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Several of Brown's recordings were not released during his lifetime, and some of those that were issued were not promoted tastefully or accurately. In the late 1940s, various tracks were licensed to [[Coral Records]]. Eventually Davis worked in [[Artists and repertoire|A&amp;R]] for [[MGM Records]], and Brown followed him to that label, where he was promoted as a [[popular music|pop]] singer. [[Compilation album]]s of his recordings have been released by various [[record label|labels]].&lt;ref name="AMG"/&gt;

Brown died by [[drowning]] after a boating accident in Florida in 1972.&lt;ref name="Bastin"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1809">The '''[[Helmholtz]] machine''' is a type of [[artificial neural network]] that can account for the hidden structure of a set of data by being trained to create a [[generative model]] of the original set of data. The hope is that by learning economical [[representations]] of the data, the underlying structure of the generative model should reasonably approximate the hidden structure of the data set. A Helmholtz machine contains two networks, a bottom-up ''recognition'' network that takes the data as input and produces a distribution over hidden variables, and a top-down "generative" network that generates values of the hidden variables and the data itself.

Helmholtz machines are usually trained using an [[unsupervised learning]] algorithm, such as the [[wake-sleep algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The wake-sleep algorithm for unsupervised neural networks|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/268/5214/1158|journal = Science|date = 1995-05-26|pages = 1158–1161|volume = 268|issue = 5214|doi = 10.1126/science.7761831|first = Geoffrey E.|last = Hinton|first2 = Peter|last2 = Dayan|first3 = Brendan J.|last3 = Frey|first4 = Radford|last4 = Neal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helmholtz machines  may also be used in applications requiring a supervised learning algorithm (e.g. character recognition, or position-invariant recognition of an object within a field).

&lt;!--reduce redundancy of wording--&gt;
'''Hepatic artery embolization''' (HAE), also known as trans-arterial embolization (TAE), is one of the several therapeutic methods to treat primary liver tumors or [[metastases]] to the liver. The [[embolization]] therapy can reduce the size of the tumor, and decrease the tumor's impact such its hormone production, effectively decreasing symptoms. The treatment was initially developed in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="DelPrete2014"/&gt; The  several types of hepatic artery treatments are based on the observation that tumor cells get nearly all their nutrients from the hepatic artery, while the normal cells of the liver get about 70-80 percent of their nutrients and 50% their oxygen supply from the portal vein, and thus can survive with the hepatic artery effectively blocked.&lt;ref name="Pommier2003"/&gt; In practice, hepatic artery embolization occludes the blood flow to the tumors,&lt;ref name="Kvols" /&gt; achieving significant tumor shrinkage in over 80% of people.&lt;!--replace with updated ref--&gt;&lt;ref name="Kvols" /&gt; Shrinkage rates vary.&lt;!--expand from ref--&gt;&lt;ref name="Gu2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis2012"/&gt;

==Background==
The  several types of [[hepatic artery]] treatments are based on the observation that [[neoplasm|tumor cell]]s get nearly all their nutrients from the hepatic artery, while the normal cells of the liver get about 70-80 percent of their nutrients and 50% their oxygen supply from the [[portal vein]], and thus can survive with the hepatic artery effectively blocked.&lt;ref name="Pommier2003"/&gt; In practice,  hepatic artery embolization is an option if the neoplastic growth is mainly within the liver.&lt;ref name="Chan2011"/&gt; By occluding the blood supply to the tumors,&lt;ref name="Kvols" /&gt; achieving significant tumor shrinkage in over 80% of people.&lt;!--replace with updated ref--&gt;&lt;ref name="Kvols" /&gt; Shrinkage rates vary.&lt;!--expand from ref--&gt;&lt;ref name="Gu2012"/&gt; The therapy can effectively decrease symptoms by reducing the size of the tumor, or by decreasing the tumor's impact, for example by decreasing the tumor's production of [[hormone]]s.&lt;ref name="Strosberg2006"/&gt;

Primary liver tumors, metastatic [[neuroendocrine tumor]]s to the liver&lt;ref name="Castellano"/&gt; and other [[metastases]] to the liver&lt;ref name="Riemsma2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lodh2014"/&gt; may be considered for therapy directed via the hepatic artery.

==Method==
{{Main|Embolization}}
The percutaneous [[Seldinger technique]] introduces a [[catheter]], which is a thin flexible tube made of medical grade material, into the [[hepatic artery]] under radiological control.&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RSNA-ACR"/&gt; This approach was developed for [[metastasis|metastatic]] [[neuroendocrine tumor]]s in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="DelPrete2014"/&gt; Tumor cells get over 90% of their nutrients from the hepatic artery,&lt;ref name="DelPrete2014"/&gt; while the normal cells of the liver get about 70-80 percent of their nutrients and 50% their oxygen supply from the portal vein, and thus can survive with the hepatic artery effectively blocked.&lt;ref name="DelPrete2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pommier2003"/&gt; Once the catheter is carefully placed in the artery or in a selected branch, the blood flow can be occluded by injecting various items, such as plastic particles, glue, metal coils, foam, or by deploying a balloon.&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus"/&gt; Additional considerations and procedural details have been reviewed.&lt;ref name="DelPrete2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

==Related methods==
In hepatic artery chemotherapy (HAC), chemotherapy agents are given into the hepatic artery, often by steady infusion over hours or even days. Compared with systemic chemotherapy, a higher proportion of the chemotherapy agents is (in theory) delivered to the lesions in the liver.&lt;ref name="Fong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leal2015"/&gt;

Hepatic artery chemoembolization (HACE), sometimes called [[transarterial chemoembolization]] (TACE), combines hepatic artery embolization with hepatic artery chemo infusion. In one method, embospheres bound with chemotherapy agents injected into the hepatic artery, lodge in downstream capillaries. The spheres not only block blood flow to the lesions but by halting the chemotherapy agents in the neighborhood of the lesions, they provide a much better targeting leverage than chemo infusion provides.

'''Hydrops fetalis''' is a [[disease|condition]] in the [[fetus]] characterized by an accumulation of fluid, or [[edema]], in at least two [[fetal compartment]]s.&lt;ref name="urlHydrops Fetalis: eMedicine Pediatrics: Cardiac Disease and Critical Care Medicine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/974571-overview |title=Hydrops Fetalis: eMedicine Pediatrics: Cardiac Disease and Critical Care Medicine |format= |website= |accessdate=2010-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, [[hydrops allantois]] or [[hydrops amnion]] is an accumulation of excessive fluid in the [[allantois|allantoic]] or [[amniotic sac|amniotic space]], respectively.&lt;ref name="urlEquine stud farm medicine and surgery"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=uVaQTJwuyUQC&amp;pg=PA298&amp;dq=hydrops+amnion#v=onepage&amp;q=hydrops%20amnion&amp;f=false |title=Equine stud farm medicine and surgery |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-02-11|isbn=9780702021305 |last1=Knottenbelt |first1=Derek C. |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

Locations can include:

* [[subcutaneous tissue]]/[[scalp]]
* [[pleura]] ([[pleural effusion]])
* [[pericardium]] ([[pericardial effusion]])
* [[abdomen]] ([[ascites]])

The [[edema]] is usually seen in the fetal subcutaneous tissue, sometimes leading to [[spontaneous abortion]].  It is a prenatal form of [[heart failure]], in which the heart is unable to satisfy demand (in most cases abnormally high) for blood flow.

==Causes==
Hydrops fetalis usually stems from fetal [[anemia]], when the heart needs to pump a much greater volume of blood to deliver the same amount of oxygen.  This anemia can have either an immune or non-immune cause.  Non-immune hydrops can also be unrelated to anemia, for example if a fetal [[tumor]] or [[congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation]] increases the demand for blood flow.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The increased demand for cardiac output leads to heart failure, and corresponding edema.

===Immune===
*[[Rh disease]] is an increasingly uncommon cause of immune-mediated hydrops fetalis. Due to preventative methods developed in the 1970s, the incidence of Rh disease has markedly declined.  [[Rh disease]] can be prevented by administration of anti-D IgG ([[Rho(D) Immune Globulin]]) injections to RhD-negative mothers during pregnancy and/or within 72 hours of the delivery. However, a small percentage of pregnant mothers are still susceptible to Rh disease even after receiving anti-D IgG (Rho(D) Immune Globulin)

===Non-immune===
The non-immune form of hydrops fetalis has many causes including:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) Clinical Guideline #7: nonimmune hydrops fetalis|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937814024430|journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|date = 2015-02-01|pages = 127–139|volume = 212|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2014.12.018|first = Mary E.|last = Norton|first2 = Suneet P.|last2 = Chauhan|first3 = Jodi S.|last3 = Dashe|pmid=25557883}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*[[Iron deficiency anemia]]
*[[Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia]] resulting in [[heart failure]]
*Deficiency of the enzyme [[beta-glucuronidase]].  This enzyme deficiency is the cause of the [[lysosomal storage disease]] called [[mucopolysaccharidosis type VII]].
*Congenital disorders of glycosylation
*[[Parvovirus B19]] (fifth disease) infection of the pregnant woman
*[[Cytomegalovirus]] in mother
*[[Congenital pulmonary airway malformation]] (formerly called [[congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation]])
*Maternal [[syphilis]] and maternal diabetes mellitus
*[[Alpha-thalassemia]] can also cause hydrops fetalis when all four of the genetic loci for α globin are deleted or affected by mutation.  This is termed Hb Barts (consists of y-4 tetramers).

==Diagnosis==
Hydrops fetalis can be diagnosed and monitored by [[Obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasound]] scans. Prenatal ultrasound scanning enables early recognition of hydrops fetalis and has been enhanced with the introduction of [[Transcranial_Doppler|MCA Doppler]].

The treatment depends on the cause.

Severely [[anemic]] fetuses, including those with Rh disease and alpha thalassemia major, can be treated with [[blood transfusions]] while still in the womb.

'''''In the Heart of the Sea''''' is a 2015 [[adventure film|adventure]]-[[drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed and produced by [[Ron Howard]] and written by [[Charles Leavitt]]. It is based on [[Nathaniel Philbrick]]'s non-fiction [[In the Heart of the Sea|book of the same name]], about the sinking of the American [[whaleship|whaling ship]] ''[[Essex (whaleship)|Essex]]'' in 1820, an event that inspired the novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]''. An [[international co-production]] between the United States and Spain, the film stars [[Chris Hemsworth]], [[Benjamin Walker (actor)|Benjamin Walker]], [[Cillian Murphy]], [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]], [[Ben Whishaw]], and [[Brendan Gleeson]].

The film premiered in [[New York City]] on December 7, 2015, and was released in cinemas in the United States on December 11, 2015, by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]]. ''In the Heart of the Sea'' received mixed reviews from critics, and grossed $93 million against a $100 million budget.&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt;

==Plot==
In 1850, author [[Herman Melville]] visits innkeeper [[Thomas Nickerson]], the last survivor of the sinking of the whaleship ''[[Essex (whaleship)|Essex]]'', offering money in return for his story. Nickerson initially refuses, but then finally agrees when his wife intervenes.

The story turns to 1820: a [[whaling]] company in [[Nantucket]] has refitted the ''Essex'' to participate in the lucrative [[whale oil]] trade, and 14-year-old Nickerson signs on as a [[cabin boy]]. The owners hire veteran whaler [[Owen Chase]] as first mate, though he is disappointed not to receive a captain's commission. The captain is [[George Pollard, Jr.|George Pollard]], an inexperienced mariner from an established whaling family who envies Chase's skill and popularity. Chase and Pollard clash, leading Pollard to sail into a storm against Chase's advice. The two agree to put their differences aside, rather than risking their reputations by returning to port without profit, and soon, the crew kills their first bull sperm whale.

Three months pass with no further successes, and Pollard realizes that the [[Atlantic Ocean]] holds no sighting of whales. The ''Essex'' sails past [[Cape Horn]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], hoping for better luck in catching one. In [[Atacames]], [[Ecuador]], the officers meet a Spanish captain who tells them his crew found the bountiful "Offshore Grounds" 2,000 miles to the west, but claims that a vengeful "white whale" destroyed his ship, killing six of his men. Denying the story as a myth, Pollard and Chase lead the expedition west. They find the undisturbed grounds, but when they launch the whaling boats, the white whale, a massive [[Albinism in biology|albino]] bull [[sperm whale]] attacks, damaging the boats and turning on the ship.

Chase [[harpoon]]s it from the ''Essex''{{'}}s deck, but the whale staves the ship in half, killing two men. The crew abandons the sinking ''Essex'' in the three intact whaling boats, and must sail hundreds of miles to shore with very limited supplies. The whale follows and attacks again, but they escape to the tiny [[Henderson Island (Pitcairn Islands)|Henderson Island]]. While gathering food, Chase discovers the corpses of earlier castaways, and concludes that the crew will soon die on the island before another ship passes by. Four men decide to stay, while the rest set sail again on the boats with hopes to find land. Soon after, one of the men dies, and the remaining crew reluctantly decide to [[Cannibalism|cannibalize]] him.

The older Nickerson is overcome by emotion and stops his story; however, when his wife comforts him, he feels encouraged enough to finish. Back in the 1820s, the three boats separate and one is lost. The other two further resort to cannibalism to survive, with Pollard's cousin Henry Coffin sacrificing himself.

The whale returns, and Chase gets into position for a final attack. The whale breaches for a moment, allowing Chase to observe a portion of his previously thrown harpoon still embedded in the whale's skull. Chase hesitates, and stares into the whale's left eye. He decides not to attack. Following this encounter, the whale swims away peacefully, and is never seen again.

A passing ship rescues Pollard's boat, but Chase's boat continues to drift with no food or water. Finally, with the survivors on the verge of death, they reach land. The survivors return to Nantucket and finally reunite with their distraught families. The ship's owners ask Pollard and Chase to cover up the story to protect the industry, but after Chase refuses to go along, Pollard reveals the truth in the inquiry.

Nickerson relates that a ship was sent to Henderson Island to rescue the surviving men there, Chase continued sailing the seas and became a merchant captain, and Pollard led another expedition to kill the whale, but the ship wrecked and he was forced to retire. Melville departs, to compose his novel, ''[[Moby-Dick]],'' beginning by writing its first line: "[[Ishmael (Moby-Dick)|Call me Ishmael]]".

To get the right effect, 500 gallons of icy water were poured from cannons.&lt;ref name="NDN"/&gt;

During one point of filming, the cast and crew were forced to retreat to their hotel by a storm off the Canary Islands, which turned into a rare flash flood. The production shut down for a day and a half, expanding the shoot to 73 days, exactly as filmmakers expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-in-the-heart-of-the-sea-tamed-the-elements-1448473340|title=How ‘In the Heart of the Sea’ Tamed the Elements|author=Steve Knopper|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=November 25, 2015|accessdate=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The film was originally scheduled to be released in the United States and Canada on March 13, 2015, but was later pushed back to December 11 in order to convert the film into [[3D film|3D]] as well as to give it higher chances of being a [[Film awards seasons|awards season]] contender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lesnick|first1=Silas|title=Warner Bros.

==Reception==

===Box office===
''In the Heart of the Sea'' was one of two [[box office bomb|flops]] released by Warner Bros in 2015, the other being ''[[Pan (2015 film)|Pan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/time-warner-reports-mixed-quarterly-results-due-to-movie-flops-1201702038/|title=Time Warner Reports Mixed Quarterly Results Due to Movie Flops|author=Brent Lang|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=February 10, 2016|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It grossed $25 million in North America and $68.9 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $93.9 million, against a production budget of $100 million.&lt;ref name=BOM /&gt;

'''Jan Joosten van Lodensteyn''' (or Lodensteijn) (1556–1623) was a native of [[Delft]] and one of the first [[Dutch people|Dutchmen]] in [[Japan]], and the second mate on the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] ship ''De Liefde'', which was stranded in Japan in 1600. Some of his shipmates were [[Jacob Quaeckernaeck]], [[Melchior van Santvoort]], and [[William Adams (sailor)|William Adams]].

Although not allowed to return to the Netherlands, Joosten was allowed to take a Japanese wife and was given a permit to engage in foreign trade. He was privileged to wear the two swords of the [[samurai]] and received an annual stipend which placed him (along with Adams) among the ranks of the ''[[hatamoto]]'' or direct retainers of the ''[[shōgun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Corr, Adams the Pilot: The Life and Times of Captain William Adams. Pp.158&lt;/ref&gt; Joosten was said to be a drunk with a choleric temperament, and at one point was not welcome at Ieyasu's court.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

==Early life in Japan==
[[File:Monument Jan Joosten van Lodensteyn, Yaesu shopping mall.jpg|thumb|Monument to Jan Joosten in Yaesu Shopping Mall]]
''De Liefde'' (''the Love'', sometimes translated as ''the Charity'') departed [[Rotterdam]] in 1598, on a trading voyage that was a [[Sebald de Weert#Expedition to the East Indies via the Straits of Magellan|five ship expedition to the East Indies]]. After making it through the [[Straits of Magellan]], they became separated, but later rejoined the ''[[Hoop (East Indiaman)|Hoop]]'' (''Hope'') off the coast of Chile, where some of the crew and captains of both vessels lost their lives in an encounter with natives. They decide to leave hostile Spanish waters and sell their woolen cloth cargo in Japan rather than in the warmer [[Moluccas]]. The two ships encountered a storm and ''Hoop'' was lost. With a decimated and sick crew (only 24 were still alive, and several were dying) the damaged ''De Liefde'' made landfall off Bungo (present-day [[Usuki]]) on the coast of [[Kyūshū]] in April 1600. [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary priests claimed that the ship was a [[pirate]] vessel and that the crew should be executed. The ship was seized on orders of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], the ''[[daimyō]]'' of [[Edo]] (modern Tokyo) and the future ''[[shōgun]],'' and later the crew was ordered to sail her to [[Sakai, Osaka|Sakai]] (near Osaka) and then on to Edo.  Some of them were received by Ieyasu, who questioned them at length on European politics, wars and foreign affairs.  The crew eventually went separate ways when some decided they should split the money provided as compensation for their losses of the ship and cargo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/letterswrittenby00mura ''Letters Written by the English Residents in Japan, 1611–1623, with Other Documents on the English Trading Settlement in Japan in the Seventeenth Century''], N.

Japanese history and Western fantasy"] Henry Smith, editor, Program of Asian Studies, University of California, Santa Barbara, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; The nineteen bronze cannons were unloaded from the ship and, according to Spanish accounts, later used at the decisive [[Battle of Sekigahara]] on October 21, 1600 (between Tokogawa forces and their rivals).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engelfriet.net/Alie/Aad/deshima1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trading==
Joosten is reported to have made a fortune in trade between Japan and [[Southeast Asia]], chartering several [[Red Seal Ships]] under license from Tokugawa Ieyasu. He was reported by Dutch traders in [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] to be aboard junks carrying rich cargoes in early 1613. After the establishment of the Dutch Factory in [[Hirado, Nagasaki|Hirado]], he became a middleman between Dutch merchants and the shogunate.

He is also said to have been to [[Siam]] on one of his ships, with the Japanese adventurer and author [[Tenjiku Tokubei]]. Later, he attempted to return to the Netherlands, but after reaching [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], he was denied permission by Dutch authorities to proceed further. He drowned in the [[South China Sea]] in 1623 when his ship sank as he was returning to Japan.

==Memorials and legacy==
For his services, Jan Joosten was granted a house in [[Edo]] (now [[Tokyo]]) in an area that came to be called "Yayosu Quay" ([[Yaesu]]) after him — his name was pronounced ''yan yōsuten'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (short version: ''Yayōsu'' (耶楊子)) — the [[Yaesu]] side of [[Tokyo Station]] is also named for him.  Yaesu-dōri (Yaesu Avenue) has a monument dedicated to Jan Joosten and his life after his arrival in Japan on ''De Liefde'' with his shipmate [[William Adams (sailor)|William Adams]].

In 1999 his home town of Delft named Jan Joostenplein (Jan Joosten Square) after him (it is off Van Lodensteynstraat, which is named for a relative). There is a sculpture of "De Liefde" in the courtyard.

George Delevane, a corrupt military official who is involved in an arms-for-profit deal with a corrupt U.S. Army officer back in [[Vietnam]]. Meanwhile, three [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] soldiers survive a [[Viet Cong]] ambush and rescue two undercover American agents, named Hawkins and Jensen, whom are seeking out Delevane.

His last lead role was in ''[[The Undertaker (1988 film)|The Undertaker]]'', a [[slasher film]]. The film was completed in 1988, but was never released for the public and existed only in an incomplete form. ''The Undertaker'' was later re-edited for a DVD release by Code Red in 2010. The film is considered a [[cult classic]], due in part to Joe Spinell's involvement and its long and troubled production.

Spinell's very last role was a supporting part in playing a U.S. government official, named Hansen, in the low-budget 1989 action-thriller ''[[Rapid Fire (1989 film)|Rapid Fire]]'', his second (and last) film in working with director David A. Prior for AIP, which was filmed in [[Mobile, Alabama]] a few weeks before his death.

==Death==
Spinell died in his apartment located off of Greenpoint Avenue in Sunnyside, Queens, New York on January 13, 1989 at the age of 52. Sometime during that morning, he cut himself badly on his glass shower stall door after apparently slipping in his bathtub while showering. Soon afterward he fell asleep on his couch instead of calling for help, and his [[hemophilia]] caused him to bleed to death. His body was found by his friend Vincent Gabriele. Gabriele had phoned Spinell that evening after a woman who knew Vincent called and said Spinell did not sound well. Gabriele called, and Spinell asked him to stop over and bring some ice cream and other groceries. However, when he got there about 20 minutes after the call, Spinell did not answer the door. Gabriele then called the building superintendent who said he didn't have a key so Gabriele called 911. The ambulance workers entered the apartment through the fire escape where they found Spinell dead sitting on his living room couch. Sitting on a white sheet draped over the couch, Spinell bled to death over part of the couch from an apparent deep cut on the back of his head.

Spinell was buried in [[Calvary Cemetery, Queens]] near his home.

== Personal life ==
Spinell was married to [[pornographic actor|adult film star]] Jean Jennings (1957-2011) from February 1977 to July 1979. Together they had one daughter, but they eventually divorced (this was referenced for Spinell's role in the 1980 film ''[[Cruising (film)|Cruising]]'', where his brutal, closeted NYPD patrolman talks about how his wife had abandoned him by taking their child and leaving for Florida, which is very similar to what happened to Spinell right before he began filming this role).

He was a distant cousin of New York Giants assistant defensive coach [[Steve Spagnuolo]].

A close friend of [[Sylvester Stallone]], Spinell was the godfather of his late son [[Sage Stallone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://whatculture.com/film/sage-stallone-son-of-sylvester-found-dead-cause-of-death-still-unknown|title=Sage Stallone, Son of Sylvester, Found Dead - Cause of Death Still Unknown|date=2012-07-15|work=WhatCulture.com|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had a falling out during the shooting of their final collaboration ''[[Nighthawks (film)|Nighthawks]]'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30932|title=Stallone answers December 9th &amp; 10th Questions in a double round - plus Harry's Seen ROCKY BALBOA...|last=headgeek|work=Aint It Cool News|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/09/pakistani-family-refuses-to-kill-daughter-who-was-raped-drawing-anger/245691/ "Refusing to Kill Daughter, Pakistani Family Defies Tradition, Draws Anger".] ''[[The Atlantic]]'', 9/28/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asghar Azad.

==History==
In 2007, Soomro claimed that she stopped into a local store to buy a toy for her niece while walking home from school.&lt;ref name="theatlantic"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nosheen|first=Habiba|title=Refusing to Kill Daughter, Pakistani Family Defies Tradition, Draws Anger|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/09/refusing-to-kill-daughter-pakistani-family-defies-tradition-draws-anger/245691/|accessdate=29 May 2013|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=28 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that she alleged that she was drugged, kidnapped, and subsequently gang-raped by four men, among them a father and son.&lt;ref name="theatlantic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite news|last=Allen|first=Emily|title=Family of gang-raped Pakistani girl, 17, defies tradition of honour killing to fight for justice|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2042983/Kainat-Soomro-gang-rape-Pakistani-family-defies-honour-killing-tradition-fight-justice.html|accessdate=29 May 2013|newspaper=Mail Online|date=29 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soomro claims to have escaped three days after being taken captive.&lt;ref name="dailymail" /&gt;

After receiving his daughter back into his home, Soomro's father was allegedly rebuffed by the police, and a local tribunal determined her to be ''[[wikt:kari|kari]]'', a "black female", having lost her virginity outside of marriage.&lt;ref name="theatlantic" /&gt; Soomro was potentially subject to ''[[karo kari]]'', synonymous to honor killing; however, this notion was rejected by her father, brother, and mother.&lt;ref name="theatlantic" /&gt; Fearing the subsequent backlash of this ruling after being subject to several attacks, however, Soomro's family fled to Karachi.&lt;ref name="theatlantic" /&gt;

Defiant of traditional norms, Soomro took her alleged perpetrators to court where the judge ultimately ruled that they were innocent, stating that "There is no corroborative evidence available on record. The sole testimony of the alleged rape survivor is not sufficient."&lt;ref name="theatlantic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="frontpagemag"&gt;{{cite news|last=Crimi|first=Frank|title=The Price for Refusing to Kill Your Gang-Raped Child|url=http://frontpagemag.com/2011/frank-crimi/the-price-for-refusing-to-kill-your-gang-raped-child/|accessdate=29 May 2013|newspaper=Frontpage Mag|date=10 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kainat worked with the group WAR, [[War Against Rape]], to try to bring her attackers to justice.

{{Refimprove section|date=December 2017}}

During her captivity, Kainat was supposedly married to Ahsan Thebo, one of the alleged rapists, a ceremonial tactic that is apparently often used in Pakistan to avoid the harsh penalty for rape: death.  The cleric who performed the marriage claimed that she looked eighteen and that she did not appear to have been forced into the marriage.  The judge upheld the marriage according to Islamic law, which still takes precedence over Pakistani law, even though she was thirteen at the time and below the age of consent according to Pakistani law. She did remember signing some unknown documents and that her thumbprints were taken at gunpoint.  Pakistani law did not recognize marital rape as legitimate at the time of the trial.

None of the alleged rapists brought up the marriage when Kainat was accused of having sex outside of marriage.  The judgment of the village elders was that she should be killed.  Only when the men were accused and stood trial did they raise that defense.  The accused believe she should be silent about her ordeal.  Ahsan continued to insist that he will take her from her family.

Kainat's brother was killed a month after the court ruling, allegedly for having defended his sister during the ordeal.&lt;ref name="theatlantic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="frontpagemag" /&gt; The Soomro family have been subject to attack, Soomro's brother and father having been beaten by iron rods; Soomro, herself, also received death threats.&lt;ref name="theatlantic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="frontpagemag" /&gt; The family is currently engaged in appeals against the court's ruling.&lt;ref name="theatlantic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="frontpagemag" /&gt;

Soomro was the subject of a documentary film entitled ''[[Outlawed in Pakistan]]'', depicting her story as an alleged rape victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Frontline|title=Outlawed in Pakistan |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/outlawed-in-pakistan/|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film casts her struggle as a documentary of her and her family's struggle for justice, showcasing the subsequent losses they encounter in defying cultural conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=News Desk|title=Outlawed in Pakistan — Kainat Soomro's story on film|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/504041/outlawed-in-pakistan-kainat-soomros-story-on-film/|accessdate=29 May 2013|newspaper=The Express Tribune|date=7 Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Lost Children of the Alleghenies''' is a folk story from the [[Appalachia]] region of the [[United States]].
Joseph and George Cox are known through the [[Allegheny Mountains]] as The Lost Children of the Alleghenies. George and Joseph Cox, then aged seven and five respectively disappeared from their home in Pavia on April 24, 1856. Their dead bodies were found several days later in the surrounding woods and they were buried in the Mount Union United Methodist Church cemetery in nearby Lovely.

There is a small memorial to them in the Spruce Hollow forest in [[Blue Knob State Park]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pennsylvania-mountains-of-attractions.com/lost-children.html|title=Lost Children of The Alleghenies - The Allegheny Mountains Remember!|access-date=2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend behind the story==
George, 7, and Joseph, 5, were the sons of Samuel and Susannah Cox. The Cox family lived in a cabin built by Samuel for his wife and kids. At this time old-growth logging had not yet begun in this area of Pennsylvania and the area was still heavily forested.&lt;ref name="usnews.com"&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/pennsylvania/articles/2017-11-04/are-lost-children-still-haunting-mountain Lost children still haunting mountain] usnews.com Retrieved 27 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

During the morning of April 24, 1856, Samuel Cox heard his dog barking in the forest and thought that it must have treed a squirrel. Samuel retrieved his rifle and headed into the woods. It is thought that while Samuel was gone, the boys must have strayed from home to follow their father. Susannah thought that Samuel had taken the boys with him. It was only when Samuel returned without them that they realized their children were gone.&lt;ref name="usnews.com"/&gt; They called for the boys but received no replies. Samuel went for help from his nearest neighbors and by that evening more than one hundred men were searching for the children. Fires were lit in the forest in the hope that the boys would see one and approach. Nearly a thousand people showed up to search the next day. A nearby stream, Bob's Creek, was surging with spring snow melt and it was thought that there was no way the boys could have crossed to the other side without drowning. A search of the creek was performed but the boys were not found.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180927220721/https://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/59496 The Lost children] Roadsideamerica.com Retrieved 27 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, suspicion fell on Samuel and Susannah Cox. It was thought that they might have murdered their children in the hope of gathering donations from a sympathetic population. The Cox cabin and garden were searched but no bodies were located. The searchers went so far as to bring in a dowser and a witch from [[Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Somerset County]]. The dowser found nothing and the witch, despite claiming to know the children's location, led a search team through the woods for hours without turning up anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bureau of State Parks|first1=Pennsylvania|title=The Lost Children of the Alleghenies|publisher=Department of Conservation and Natural Resources|location=Blue Knob State Park}}&lt;/ref&gt;      

The legend tells that the night after the disappearance a local farmer, Jacob Dibert, heard about the missing children and remarked to his wife that he wished to be able to dream of the boys' location. On May 2, 1856, he had a dream in which he walked a path through the woods past a dead deer, a child's shoe and a fallen birch tree and eventually to a copse of birch trees in a small ravine. Here he found the bodies of the Cox boys. The dream reoccurred on the two following nights. Dibert told no-one but his wife about the dream; however, he felt that the dream was prophetic and on May 7 he told his brother-in-law Harrison Whysong. Whysong recognised elements from Dibert's dream and the two men decided to make a search, culminating in the discovery of the bodies just as the dream had described - under birch trees in a small ravine reached along a track with a dead deer, a child's shoe and a fallen birch.&lt;ref name="ani"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://anomalyinfo.com/?q=Stories/variations-investigation | title=The Pavia Monument | accessdate=May 30, 2012 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20140805022111/http://anomalyinfo.com/?q=Stories/variations-investigation | archive-date=2014-08-05 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural impact ==
In 1906, for the 50th anniversary of the event, the community of Pavia took up donations for a Lost Children of the Alleghenies Monument to honor the Cox family. In 1910, they erected the monument at the spot where Joseph and George Cox were found over 50 years earlier.

[[Alison Krauss]] released a song written by [[Julie Lee]] and John Pennell about the story entitled "Jacob's Dream".

'''Maria Bird''' was born Mary Edith Bird (pronounced Marie) on 24 August 1891 in [[Pietermaritzburg]], [[Colony of Natal|South Africa]] and died in the village where she lived for most of her life, [[Westerham]], Kent, England on 25 August 1979, aged 88.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=%2BZgk1ES2LzmVWGvKhGthBg&amp;scan=1 |title=FreeBMD Entry Info |website=Freebmd.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She is a descendant of [[Francis Bird]] the sculptor and Colonel Christopher Bird who was Colonial Secretary at Cape Town Castle (who has a famous landmark named after him in [[Kirstenbosch]], South Africa – Colonel Bird's Bath).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanbi.org/gardens/kirstenbosch/virtualtour/kirstenbosch-nbg-colonel-birds-bath |title=Kirstenbosch NBG: Colonel Bird's Bath |website=SANBI.org |date=2015-05-26 |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother brought her children from South Africa to the UK to be educated and Maria attended a Scottish convent. Following school, she studied the [[Dalcroze Eurhythmics]] music and dance method under [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]] in Dessau.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Transcript from interview with Maria Bird's nephew&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria Bird helped found BBC Children's Television with her collaborator and partner [[Freda Lingstrom]] with whom she set up Westerham Arts, the production company commissioned by the BBC to produce TV pieces including ''[[The Woodentops (TV series)|The Woodentops]]'' (1955), ''[[Flower Pot Men|Bill and Ben the Flower Pot Men]]'' (1952) and ''[[Andy Pandy]]'' (1950).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/10023798/Andy-Pandy-is-almost-deviant.html Andy Pandy is almost deviant], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 29 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Westerham Arts was based in Chartwell Cottage (owned by Bird and Lingstom and subsequently bequeathed to the National Trust). It neighbours the [[Chartwell]] Estate. Maria and Freda built a shed in their garden where their puppet films were made.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
In addition to TV production she was a writer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/series/85481-andy-pandy |title=Andy Pandy series by Maria Bird |website=Goodreads.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; narrator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEfnJBArxGg |title=Andy Pandy (Episode 1) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and musician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/443746/index.html |title=BFI Screenonline: Woodentops, The (1955–57) |website=Screenonline.org.uk |date=1955-09-09 |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martín de Alarcón''' was the Governor of [[Coahuila]] and [[Spanish Texas]] from 1705 until 1708, and again from 1716 until 1719.  He founded [[San Antonio]], the first Spanish civilian settlement in Texas.  

==Texas==
===First term===
Alarcón was first appointed governor of the Spanish provinces of Coahuila and Texas in 1705.&lt;ref name=weddle548&gt;Weddle (1967), p. 548.&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time, no Spanish settlements existed in [[Spanish Texas|Texas]].  The last of the original Catholic missions in [[East Texas]] had been abandoned in 1699.&lt;ref&gt;Weber (1992), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;  The French had been establishing settlements west of the [[Mississippi River]], and Spanish authorities feared that the French would expand into Texas.  In 1707, the viceroy of New Spain ordered all provincial governors to prevent the entry of foreigners and their goods.&lt;ref name=chipman107&gt;Chipman (1992), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alarcón proposed that one of the missions along the [[Rio Grande]], Mission San Bernardo, be relocated into Texas, along the [[Frio River]].&lt;ref name=weddle548/&gt;  Nothing came of this idea, and later in 1707 Alarcón authorized an expedition into Texas, primarily to dissuade the Indians in the area from becoming friendly with the French.&lt;ref name=chipman107/&gt;  The Spanish troops reached only as far as the Colorado River (Texas) o ''río San Marco'', but spent some time exploring the area around the [[San Antonio River]]; they were much impressed with the land and availability of water.&lt;ref name=chipman110&gt;Chipman (1992), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second term===
In early 1716, the Spanish government authorized a second attempt to convert the [[Hasinai]] tribe of East Texas to Christianity.&lt;ref name=chipman111&gt;Chipman (1992), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chipman112&gt;Chipman (1992), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;  Four missions and a [[presidio]] were established.  Several of the soldiers assigned to the presidio brought their families with them, marking the first Spanish women recorded to enter Texas.&lt;ref name="weber160"&gt;Weber (1992), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Alarcón was re-appointed governor of Coahuila and Texas.  He soon received word that the new missions were in dire straits, with extremely low levels of provisions.  Their supplies must come from the nearest Spanish settlement, [[Guerrero, Coahuila|San Juan Bautista]], located {{convert|400|mi|km|0}} away.&lt;ref name=chipman113&gt;Chipman (1992), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chipman (1992), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alarcón envisioned creating a way station between the interior provinces and the missions of Texas.  He looked first to the headwaters of the San Antonio River, an area the Spanish had mapped in 1707.  It was already home to a large community of [[Coahuiltecan]]s.&lt;ref name="weber163"&gt;Weber (1992), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;  

As Alarcon journeyed to San Juan Bautista, the launching point for an attempt to resupply the missions, he received a letter from Father Olivares, alleging that Frenchman [[Louis Juchereau de St. Denis]] had established an illegal trade network along the Rio Grande.  On his arrival at San Juan Bautista, Alarcon began an investigation of the allegations.&lt;ref name=weddle552&gt;Weddle (1967), p. 552.&lt;/ref&gt;  St. Denis was jailed during the four-month investigation, but Alarcon was unable to find proof that the presidial soldiers had&amp;ndash;actively or passively&amp;ndash;allowed illegal trade to flourish in the area.  St. Denis was released from prison and fled back to Louisiana.&lt;ref name=weddle553&gt;Weddle (1967), p. 553.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of Texas 1718.jpg|right|thumb|Map of Texas in 1718, during the government of Alarcon]]
By the time the investigation ended, winter had begun, making it impractical for Alarcón to immediately proceed into Texas.&lt;ref name=weddle553/&gt;  On April 9, 1718, Alarcón headed an expedition to found a community in central Texas.  He was accompanied by 72&amp;nbsp;people, including 10&amp;nbsp;families.  They brought with them 548&amp;nbsp;horses, 6&amp;nbsp;droves of mules, and other livestock.  On their arrival, the group first built a temporary structure to serve as a mission, named San Antonio de Valero, which later gained fame as the [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Alamo]].  One&amp;nbsp;mile (two&amp;nbsp;km) north of the mission, Alarcón built a presidio, [[Presidio San Antonio de Bexar]].&lt;ref name=chipman117&gt;Chipman (1992), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  Near the presidio, Alarcón chartered a new municipality, called Bejar (now known as [[San Antonio]]).  Given a status higher than a village (''pueblo'') but lower than a city (''ciudad''), San Antonio became the only ''villa'' in Texas, and the colonists who settled there relied on farming and ranching to survive.&lt;ref name="weber163" /&gt;  

With the new settlement established, Alarcón continued on to re-provision and inspect the East Texas missions.&lt;ref name=chipman118&gt;Chipman (1992), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides replenishing mission supplies, Alarcón was tasked with resettling the Indians in villages near the missions,&lt;ref name=buckley2&gt;Buckley (1911), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and wished to investigate whether the Spanish in East Texas were illegally trading with the French at nearby [[Natchitoches, LA|Natchitoches]].&lt;ref name=weddle553/&gt;  

The missionaries were becoming increasingly desperate as they waited for Alarcón to arrive.  They appointed two members, representing both the missionary schools of [[College of Santa Cruz de Querétaro|Querétaro]] and [[College of Guadalupe de Zacatecas|Zacatecas]], to carry a personal appeal to Spanish authorities in Mexico City.&lt;ref name=buckley7&gt;Buckley (1911), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their missive not only detailed the deprivations they had endured and the perceived slowness of Alarcón's response, but also mentioned their fear that France would soon extend their settlements into Texas.&lt;ref name=buckley8&gt;Buckley (1911), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  

While visiting the existing missions, Alarcón ordered that a new mission be established for the [[Nassoni]] people.  Before his orders could be enacted, he received a letter from a French explorer, [[Bernard de la Harpe]].&lt;ref name=buckley7/&gt;&lt;ref name=cox11&gt;Cox (1906), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; La Harpe had just established a trading post within Nassoni territory (now part of [[Oklahoma]]).  In a series of letters, Alarcón and la Harpe set out their positions for the boundaries between the territory of the two nations.  Alarcón maintained that the area la Harpe had settled was in fact part of Spanish New Mexico, while la Harpe responded that all of Texas should belong to the French.&lt;ref name=cox11/&gt;  Although la Harpe challenged Alarcón to remove the French trading post, Alarcon made no attempt to do so.&lt;ref name=cox12&gt;Cox (1906), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late May 1719, Alarcón and his men began their return trip to the Mexican interior.  Between the [[Brazos River]] and the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]] Alarcón encountered the '''Rancheria Grande''' which was the home to [[Yojuane]], [[Ervipiame]], [[Jumano]], [[Mayeye]] and several other allied Native American groups.  While traveling through the Rancheria Grande Alarcón attempted to set up easy trading with the people of the Rancheria by designating [[El Cuilón]], who he called Juan Rodriguez, a prominent Ervipiame, as the chief of the Rancheria and giving him the baton to designate him as a commander.&lt;ref&gt;Juliana Barr, ''Peace Came in the Form of a Woman: Indians and Spaniards in the Texas Borderlands'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2007), p. 124-125&lt;/ref&gt;     

While Alarcón and associates were en route, a group of French soldiers took control of the mission of [[Los Adeas|San Miguel de los Adeas]] from its sole defender, The French soldiers explained that 100 additional soldiers were coming, and the Spanish colonists, missionaries, and remaining soldiers abandoned the area and fled to San Antonio.&lt;ref&gt;Weber (1992), p. 166&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The missionaries sent a scathing letter to the viceroy, blaming Alarcón for their difficulties and the French usurpation of their post.&lt;ref name=buckley13&gt;Buckley (1911), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 19, 1719, Alarcón was removed from office.&lt;ref name=buckley21&gt;Buckley (1911), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NEST''' is a [[simulation software]] for spiking neural network models, including large-scale neuronal networks. NEST was initially developed by Markus Diesmann and Marc-Oliver Gewaltig and is now developed and maintained by the NEST Initiative.

== Modeling philosophy ==

A NEST [[simulation]] tries to follow the logic of an [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] experiment that takes place inside a computer with the difference, that the [[Biological neural network|neural system]] to be investigated must be defined by the experimenter.

The neural system is defined by a possibly large number of [[Biological neuron model|neurons]] and their [[Synapse|connections]]. In a NEST network, different neuron and synapse models can coexist. Any two neurons can have multiple connections with different properties. Thus, the connectivity can in general not be described by a weight or [[Adjacency matrix|connectivity matrix]] but rather as an [[adjacency list]].

To manipulate or observe the network dynamics, the experimenter can define so-called devices which represent the various instruments (for measuring and stimulation) found in an experiment. These devices write their data either to [[Computer memory|memory]] or to file.

NEST is extensible and new models for neurons, synapses, and devices can be added.

==Example==
[[File:NEST raster.png|thumb|NEST raster]]

The following example simulates spiking activity in a sparse random network with recurrent excitation and inhibition&lt;ref&gt;Brunel, N. (2000). Dynamics of sparsely connected networks of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons. [http://www.springerlink.com/index/U446L5722LP03677.pdf Journal of computational neuroscience, 8(3), 183–208.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure shows the [[Action potential|spiking activity]] of 50 neurons as a [[raster plot]]. Time increases along the horizontal axis, neuron id increases along the vertical axis.  Each dot corresponds to a [[Action potential|spike]] of the respective neuron at a given time. The lower part of the figure shows a [[histogram]] with the mean firing-rate of the neurons.

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;

==History==

NEST development was started in 1993 by Markus Diesmann and Marc-Oliver Gewaltig at the [[Ruhr University| Ruhr University Bochum]], [[Bochum]], Germany and the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] in [[Rehovot]], [[Israel]]. At this time, the simulator was called SYNOD and simulations were defined in a stack based simulation language, called SLI.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7KXmIv6ROY Video documentary on NEST] by the German [[Bernstein Network]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the software changed its name from SYNOD to NEST. Until 2004, NEST was exclusively developed and used by the founding members of the NEST Initiative. The first public release appeared in summer 2004. Since then, NEST was released regularly, about once or twice per year.

Since 2007, NEST supports hybrid parallelism, using [[POSIX threads]] and [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]].&lt;ref name="dx" /&gt;

In 2008, the stack-based simulation language SLI was superseded by a modern [[Python (programming language)|Python]] interface, however, the old simulation language is still used internally.&lt;ref&gt;Eppler, J. M., Helias, M., Diesmann, M., Muller, E., &amp; Gewaltig, M.-O. (2008). PyNEST: a convenient interface to the NEST simulator. Frontiers in Neuroinformatics, 2(January), 1–12. doi:10.3389/neuro.11.012.2008&lt;/ref&gt;
At the same time, the simulator independent specification language [[PyNN (software)|PyNN]] was developed with support for NEST.&lt;ref&gt;A. Davison, D. Brüderle, J. Eppler, J. Kremkow, E. Muller, D. Pecevski, L. Perrinet and P. Yger, PyNN: a common interface for neuronal network simulators, Front. Neuroinf. 2:11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012, the NEST Initiative changed the license from the proprietary NEST License to [[GPL|GNU GPL]] V2 or later.

== User interfaces ==
* NEST primary user interface is PyNEST, a  [[Python (programming language)|Python]] package that controls the NEST simulation kernel. PyNEST aims at easy usability and seamless interaction with  [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and its libraries.
* [[PyNN (software)|PyNN]] is a simulator independent language for neural simulations, which supports NEST as well as [[Brian (software)|BRIAN]], [[Neuron (software)|NEURON]], as well as neuromorphic hardware.
* NEST also maintains its own simulation language [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] (SLI), which understands a simple [[Stack-oriented programming language]] that is influenced by [[PostScript]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

'''Nancy Alice Edward Eaton''' (May 28, 1961 &amp;ndash; January 21, 1985) was a Canadian heiress and a member of the prominent [[Eaton family]]. She was the great-great-granddaughter of [[Timothy Eaton]], founder of [[Eaton's]] [[department store]]s. She was the only daughter of Edward Eaton and Nancy Leigh (Gossage) Eaton of [[Toronto]].

==Murder==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7908">'''Norman David Mayer''' (March 31, 1916 – December 9, 1982) was an American [[Nuclear disarmament|anti-nuclear weapons]] activist who was shot and killed by the [[United States Park Police]] after threatening to blow up the [[Washington Monument]].

==Early life==
Mayer was born in [[El Paso]], [[Texas]], to Jesse and Margott Mayer. After his father died two years later, his penniless mother moved him and his brother Aubrey to [[New Orleans]]; she then entered nursing school and placed the children in an orphanage. As a teenager, Mayer attended a trade school where he trained as a tool and die maker. He left New Orleans and spent much of the 1930s travelling from job to job from [[Nome, Alaska]], to the [[Caribbean]], working in a rubber plant and in gold mines among other jobs. He was drafted into the [[United States Navy]] in 1944 while living in [[Los Angeles]] and spent two years stationed at the [[San Diego Naval Station]]. He was discharged as a [[seaman first class|fireman first class]] and returned to a life of drifting, working in [[Miami]] as a machinist in the mid-1950s, as a hotel maintenance man in [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Virgin Islands]] and [[Jamaica]] during the 1960s, and as a helicopter mechanic in [[South Vietnam]] from 1969-1970. In 1971, he was seriously injured while working on an oil rig in [[Brunei]] and recuperated in [[Singapore]] before traveling across South Asia. In 1976, he was arrested in [[Hong Kong]] for possession of {{convert|20|kg|lb}} of marijuana in a botched attempt to make a sale. Mayer researched the law in jail and after fifteen months managed to have his conviction reversed on a technicality. He was deported back to the U.S. and returned to working in hotels.

==Nuclear weapons protests and Washington Monument threat==
[[File:PeacePark.jpg|thumb|right|The [[White House Peace Vigil]], June 2006.]]
In 1978, Mayer focused on protesting nuclear weapons. He wished to stage a destructive and dramatic event to grab attention for his cause, and unsuccessfully tried to purchase explosives in [[Hazard, Kentucky]], in May 1982. Mayer moved to [[Washington, DC]] in June that year, and spent every day for the next few months displaying large plywood signs in front of the [[White House]] and proselytizing to passing tourists. Mayer eventually found this manner of protesting frustrating and ineffectual and developed a new attention-getting scheme.

On December 8, 1982, Mayer drove a white van bearing the message "#1 PRIORITY: BAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS" in large letters on its side up to the base of the Washington Monument and jumped out wearing a black motorcycle helmet, a bright blue snowsuit and carrying a remote control. Mayer claimed that he would destroy the Monument with {{convert|1,000|lb|kg|sigfig=1}} of TNT loaded in his van unless a national dialogue on the threat of nuclear weapons was seriously undertaken. Mayer also claimed that he had a hidden accomplice who could also detonate the explosives.

The U.S. Park Police evacuated nearby buildings and closed down streets for several blocks. Eight tourists were initially trapped inside the Monument, but were released after [[Associated Press|AP]] reporter Steven Komarow began negotiating with Mayer. Ten hours into the negotiation, Mayer jumped into his van and started to drive off, threatening to become "a moving time bomb in downtown Washington". The police opened fire, striking Mayer four times&amp;mdash;twice in the head.

The Park Police later claimed that they did not intend to shoot Mayer, but were instead aiming for the van's engine.{{Citation needed|date = February 2013}} Their subsequent investigation disclosed that Mayer had neither explosives nor an accomplice.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Mayer was one of a number of individuals connected to the [[White House Peace Vigil]] at [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://prop1.org/conchita/cpnorm.htm In Memory of Norman Mayer]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oracles of Pennsylvania Avenue'' (2012) by Tim Wilkerson, a documentary commissioned by the [[Al Jazeera Documentary Channel]], recounts the lives of Mayer, [[Thomas (activist)|Thomas]], [[Concepcion Picciotto]] and [[Ellen Thomas]].&lt;ref name=Jazeera&gt;{{cite video| people=Tim Wilkerson (Director)|title=[http://aje.me/HHwQcE The Oracles of Pennsylvania Avenue]|medium=Documentary|publisher=Al Jazeera Documentary Channel|location= |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas, who believed in [[nonviolence]], refused to take part in Mayer's plan to destroy public monuments, as Mayer was unable to assure him of the safety of civilians and officials.&lt;ref name=Jazeera /&gt;

==Reactions==
[[George Stephanopoulos]], later [[White House Press Secretary]] and communications director under President [[Bill Clinton]], was a 21-year-old intern at the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] when Mayer stopped in his office several times to discuss nuclear disarmament. On December 8, 1982, Stephanopoulos made his first appearance on ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'' to discuss Mayer.

In the December 19, 1982, installment of his column "An Edge in My Voice", the writer and activist [[Harlan Ellison]] discussed the incident, expressing great sympathy for Mayer's position and outrage at what he regarded as an overreaction by law enforcement. Ellison, who claimed to have recognized Mayer's threat as a bluff as soon as he heard TV reports on the crisis, noted that, had the threat been genuine, the explosion of {{convert|1,000|lb|kg|sigfig=1}} of TNT, even at such close proximity, would have barely damaged the Washington Monument's exterior and could not have possibly destroyed it. Ellison expressed his sadness over the unnecessary death of Mayer saying, "Had there been a scintilla of compassion, rather than macho posturing, in any of the authorities handling the situation, it need not have ended as it did.  But there were none... not on the part of the White House advisors who moved Ronald Reagan's luncheon out of the room facing the Monument. And not on the part of our noble President who, like Richard Nixon, saw what was going on and shrugged, and ignored his responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;Harlan Ellison, [http://harlanellison.com/iwrite/mayer.htm "An Edge in my Voice"], ''L.A. Weekly'', December 19, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The column was among several reprinted in Ellison's collections ''[[An Edge in My Voice]]'' and ''[[Edgeworks 1]]''. A recording of Ellison reading the column is found on the CD ''[[On the Road with Ellison Volume 1]]''.

'''Oligohydramnios''' is a condition in [[pregnancy]] characterized by a deficiency of [[amniotic fluid]].  It is the opposite of [[polyhydramnios]].

==Signs and symptoms==

The common clinical features are smaller symphysio-fundal height, fetal malpresentation, undue prominence of fetal parts and reduced amount of amniotic fluid.

===Complications===
Complications may include cord compression, musculoskeletal abnormalities such as facial distortion and [[clubfoot]], [[pulmonary hypoplasia]] and [[intrauterine growth restriction]].  [[Amnion nodosum]] is frequently also present (nodules on the fetal surface of the [[amnion]]).&lt;ref name="pmid18081444"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Adeniran AJ, Stanek J |title=Amnion nodosum revisited: clinicopathologic and placental correlations |journal=Arch Pathol Lab Med |volume=131 |issue=12 |pages=1829–33 |year=2007 |pmid=18081444 |doi=10.1043/1543-2165(2007)131[1829:ANRCAP]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of oligohydramnios as a predictor of gestational complications is controversial.&lt;ref name="pmid17689653"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson JM, Chauhan SP, Ennen CS, Niederhauser A, Magann EF |title=A comparison of 3 criteria of oligohydramnios in identifying peripartum complications: a secondary analysis |journal=Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. |volume=197 |issue=2 |pages=207.e1–7; discussion 207.e7–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17689653 |doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2007.04.048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17896253"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elsandabesee D, Majumdar S, Sinha S |title=Obstetricians' attitudes towards 'isolated' oligohydramnios at term |journal=Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=574–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17896253 |doi=10.1080/01443610701469669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Potter syndrome]] is a condition caused by oligohydramnios.  Affected fetuses develop pulmonary hypoplasia, limb deformities, and characteristic facies.  Bilateral agenesis of the fetal kidneys is the most common cause due to the lack of fetal urine.

==Causes==
The cause is not known but is often associated with some:
* fetal chromosomal anomalies like triploidy
* intra uterine infections
* premature rupture of membrane 
* drugs; [[PG inhibitor]]s like indomethacin , [[ACE inhibitor]]s 
* renal agenesis or obstruction of the urinary tract of the fetus preventing micturition such as posterior urethral valves in males
* [[intrauterine growth restriction]] (IUGR) associated with placental insufficiency
* ''amnion nodosum''; failure of secretion by the cells of the amnion covering the placenta
* postmaturity (dysmaturity)

==Diagnosis==
* uterine size is much smaller than the period of [[amenorrhoea]]
* fewer fetal movements,
* the uterus "full of fetus" because of scanty liquid,
* [[Presentation (obstetrics)|malpresentation]] ([[Breech birth|breech]])
* evidences of IUGR of the fetus,
* sonographic diagnosis is made when largest liquid pool is less than 2&amp;nbsp;cm,
* visualization of normal filling and emptying of fetal bladder essentially rule out urinary tract abnormality,
* ''Oligohydramnios'' with fetal symmetric growth retardation is associated with increased chromosomal abnormality.

==Treatment==
A [[Cochrane review]] concluded that "simple maternal hydration appears to increase amniotic fluid volume and may be beneficial in the management of oligohydramnios and prevention of oligohydramnios during labour or prior to external cephalic version."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hofmeyr|first=G. J.|last2=Gülmezoglu|first2=A. M.|date=2002|title=Maternal hydration for increasing amniotic fluid volume in oligohydramnios and normal amniotic fluid volume|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=1|pages=CD000134|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000134|issn=1469-493X|pmid=11869566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In severe cases oligohydramnios may be treated with [[amnioinfusion]] during labor to prevent [[umbilical cord compression]]. There is uncertainty about the procedure's safety and efficacy, and it is recommended that it should only be performed in centres specialising in invasive [[Maternal-fetal medicine|fetal medicine]] and in the context of a [[multidisciplinary team]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pathways.nice.org.uk/pathways/antenatal-care#path=view%3A/pathways/antenatal-care/interventional-procedures-for-some-complications-in-pregnancy.xml&amp;content=view-node%3Anodes-oligohydramnios Oligohydramnios] at the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]]. Based on the overview [http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/ip/IP338overview.pdf Therapeutic amnioinfusion for oligohydramnios during pregnancy (excluding labour)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218201856/http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/ip/IP338overview.pdf |date=2013-02-18 }} in 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In case of [[congenital lower urinary tract obstruction]], [[fetal surgery]] seems to improve survival, according to a [[randomized study|randomized]] yet small study.&lt;ref name=Morris2013&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Morris | first1 = R.

'''''Outbreak''''' is a 1995 American [[medical fiction|medical]] [[disaster film]] directed by [[Wolfgang Petersen]] and based on [[Richard Preston]]'s nonfiction book ''[[The Hot Zone]]''.&lt;ref name=Walton2004/&gt; It stars [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Rene Russo]] and [[Morgan Freeman]], and co-stars [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]], [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Donald Sutherland]] and [[Patrick Dempsey]].

The film focuses on an outbreak of a fictional [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola-like virus]], Motaba, in [[Zaire]] and later in a small town in the United States. It is primarily set in the [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the fictional town of Cedar Creek, California. ''Outbreak''{{'s}} plot speculates how far military and civilian agencies might go to contain the spread of a deadly, contagious disease.

The film, released on March 10, 1995, was a box-office success and Spacey won two awards for his performance. A real-life outbreak of the Ebola virus was occurring in Zaire when the film was released.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- As WP:FILMPLOT requires, the plot summary should be no less and no more than 400–700 words. --&gt;

In 1967, a virus called Motaba, which causes a [[viral hemorrhagic fever|deadly fever]], is discovered in the [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|African]] jungle. To keep the virus a secret, [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officers Donald McClintock and William Ford destroy the camp where soldiers were infected. Twenty-eight years later, Colonel Sam Daniels, a [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases|USAMRIID]] virologist, is sent to investigate an outbreak in [[Zaire]]. He and his crew—Lieutenant Colonel Casey Schuler and new recruit Major Salt—gather information and return to the United States. Ford, now a brigadier general and Daniels' superior officer, dismisses the latter's fears that the virus will spread.

Betsy, a [[white-headed capuchin]] monkey that is host to the virus, is smuggled into the country. James "Jimbo" Scott, a worker at an [[animal testing]] laboratory, is infected when he steals Betsy to sell on the [[black market]]. Jimbo fails to sell Betsy to Rudy Alvarez, a pet-store owner in the [[California]] town of Cedar Creek. After releasing the monkey in the woods of [[Palisades (California Sierra)|Palisades]], he develops symptoms on a flight to [[Boston]] and infects his girlfriend, Alice. Their illness is investigated by Dr. Roberta Keough, a [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] scientist and Daniels' ex-wife. Jimbo, Alice, and Rudy die, but Keough determines that no one else in Boston was infected.

A hospital technician in Cedar Creek is infected when he accidentally breaks the vial of Rudy's blood. The virus mutates into a strain capable of spreading like [[influenza]], allowing a number of people to be infected in a movie theater. Daniels flies to Cedar Creek against Ford's orders, joining Keough's team with Schuler and Salt. As they begin a search for the monkey, the Army quarantines the town and imposes [[martial law]]. Schuler is infected when his suit tears, and Keough accidentally sticks herself with a contaminated needle.

When Ford provides an experimental serum, Daniels realizes that he was aware of the virus before the outbreak. He confronts Ford, who admits that the original Motaba strain was actually a military [[biological agent|bioweapon]]; the 1967 outbreak in Africa had in fact been a test-run of the virus, which subsequently infected the local monkey population despite Ford's and McClintock's attempt to halt its spread and cover up their actions. Daniels learns about Operation Clean Sweep, a plan for the military to contain the virus by bombing Cedar Creek. McClintock, now a major general, plans to use the operation to conceal the virus's existence. 

To prevent Daniels from finding a cure, McClintock orders him arrested for carrying the virus. Daniels escapes, and he and Salt fly a helicopter to the ship which carried Betsy. Daniels obtains a picture of Betsy and releases it to the media; a Palisades resident, Mrs. Jeffries, realizes that her daughter Kate has been playing with Betsy in their yard and calls the CDC. Daniels and Salt arrive at the Jeffries' house, and Salt tranquilizes Betsy after Kate coaxes her out of hiding. When he learns from Daniels about Betsy's capture, Ford delays the bombing.

On their return flight, Daniels and Salt are chased by McClintock in another helicopter, and Salt fires two [[Air-to-surface missile|missiles]] into the trees to deceive him into thinking that they crashed. In Cedar Creek, Salt mixes Betsy's [[antibody|antibodies]] with Ford's serum to create an [[antiserum]]; although Schuler has died, they save Keough. McClintock returns to base and resumes Operation Clean Sweep, refusing to listen to Ford. Daniels and Salt fly a helicopter in the path of the bomber. With Ford's help, Daniels persuades the bomber's flight crew to detonate the bomb over water and spare the town. Before McClintock can order another bombing, Ford relieves him of command and orders his arrest. Daniels and Keough reconcile, and Cedar Creek's residents are cured.

==Production==
Scenes in "Cedar Creek" were filmed in [[Ferndale, California]], where tanks and helicopters were a common feature of daily life during nearly two months of filming.&lt;ref name="Haeseler"/&gt; Other locations used were [[Dugway Proving Ground]] and [[Kauai]].&lt;ref name=DArc/&gt;

In November 2017, amid [[Kevin_Spacey#Sexual_misconduct_allegations|a series of sexual misconduct allegations against Spacey]], [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] veteran Mark Ebenhoch, who had been a military advisor on the film, revealed that the actor made an unwanted sexual advance toward him during production.&lt;ref&gt;{{first=Maria|last=Puente|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/11/07/kevin-spacey-scandal-complete-list-13-accusers/835739001/|title=Kevin Spacey scandal: A complete list of the 15 accusers|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=McLean, Virginia|date=November 7, 2017|accessdate=May 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Adam B.|last1=Vary|first2=Susan|last2=Cheng|first3=Dara|last3=Levy|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/kevin-spacey-more-accusations-secrets-abuse|title=A Pattern Of Abuse: How Kevin Spacey Used The Closet To Silence His Victims|work=[[Buzzfeed]]|date=November 3, 2017|accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==

===Box office===
''Outbreak'' topped the U.S. box-office list its opening weekend with earnings of $13,420,387,&lt;ref name=Natale/&gt; and spent three weeks at number one before ''[[Tommy Boy]]''{{'}}s release.&lt;ref name=Natale2/&gt; The film, which grossed $67,659,560 domestically and $122,200,000 internationally,&lt;ref name=bomojo/&gt; was a commercial success.&lt;ref name=Haase/&gt;

==={{anchor|Reception}}Critical reception===
''Outbreak'' received mixed reviews. According to review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 59% of 44 critics gave the film a positive review for a rating average of 5.6 out of 10.&lt;ref name=RottenTom/&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A-" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt; {{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave it three-and-a-half out of four stars, calling ''Outbreak''{{'s}} premise "one of the great scare stories of our time, the notion that deep in the uncharted rain forests, deadly diseases are lurking, and if they ever escape their jungle homes and enter the human bloodstream, there will be a new plague the likes of which we have never seen."&lt;ref name=Ebert/&gt; Rita Kempley of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' also enjoyed the film's plot: "''Outbreak'' is an absolute hoot thanks primarily to director Wolfgang Petersen's rabid pacing and the great care he brings to setting up the story and its probability."&lt;ref name=WashPost/&gt;

[[David Denby]] wrote for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine that although the opening scenes were well-done, "somewhere in the middle ... ''Outbreak'' falls off a cliff" and becomes "lamely conventional".&lt;ref name=Denby/&gt; [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' also found the film's subject compelling but its treatment ineffective: "The film's shallowness also contributes to the impression that no problem is too thorny to be solved by movie heroics."&lt;ref name=Maslin/&gt;

'''Petros''' was a [[great white pelican]]. It was the official [[mascot]] of the [[Greece|Greek]] island of [[Mykonos]].

In 1958, a wounded [[pelican]] was found off the coast of [[Mykonos]] by a local fisherman. The pelican was nursed to health and remained on the island supported by locals. It soon adopted the name "[[Peter (given name)|Petros]]", as a joke among locals, as "petro" in Greek means "rock" or "stone", but metaphorically "old and grumpy"{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. Petros was hit and killed by a car in  December 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-02-02/travel/8601090354_1_pelican-mykonos-cycladic-islands|title=Greek Island Loses Treasured Friend When Petros The Pelican Dies|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, three new pelicans took up residence around the main town of Mykonos. One, honorifically, was given the name "Petros".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mykonos Petros the Pelican|url=http://www.greeka.com/cyclades/mykonos/mykonos-villages/mykonos-town/petros-pelican.htm|work=Greeka|publisher=greeka.com|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 192-063, KZ Mauthausen, Erschossener Häftling.jpg|thumb|250px|A prisoner who was shot and killed at [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]]]]
The '''''Postenpflicht''''' ("Duty of Guards") was part of a written order for [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] guards in [[Nazi concentration camp]]s regarding the use of firearms. It required SS guards to shoot prisoners who tried to escape or engage in resistance and to do so without verbal warning or a warning shot. This was relevant for example regarding the so-called "death strip" next to camp fences. The area next to these fences was off-limits and anyone getting too close to it was, in accordance with the Postenpflicht, killed without warning. The order stated that failure to shoot would result in the dismissal or arrest of the guard. Issued on October 1, 1933 as an order for Dachau, the order was later extended to other camps.

''Münchner Neueste Nachrichten'' (March 21, 1933) Retrieved May 11, 2010 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though initially using local [[Munich]] policemen as guards, within weeks, they were replaced by the SS and on April 13, 1933, [[Hilmar Wäckerle]], an SS-[[Standartenführer]], became the first commandant. He was instructed by [[Heinrich Himmler]], Munich chief of police and [[Obergruppenführer]] of the SS, to draw up a set of regulations for discipline in the camp. The rules were extremely harsh and several prisoners died as a direct result of their punishment.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The Munich prosecutor's office, not yet [[Gleichschaltung|fully in line]] with [[National Socialist]] policy, in May 1933, began investigating the murder of several prisoners at [[Dachau concentration camp]], prompted by the formal complaint of Sophie Handschuh, who wanted to know the true cause of her son's death at Dachau.&lt;ref name="Klee"&gt;Ernst Klee, ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich'', Frankfurt am Main (2007) p. 648 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter of June 2, 1933, Munich District Court Prosecutor II to the State Ministry of Justice: Subject: "Death of [[protective custody]] prisoners at Dachau concentration camp." {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=July 2012}} Rumors were already widespread about harsh treatment of those under detention and Himmler was forced to refute those claims, even while announcing the opening of Dachau.&lt;ref name="dachau1" /&gt; Charges of murder were filed against Wäckerle and Himmler was forced to remove Wäckerle. The murder charges were later dropped after the chief prosecutor and his assistant were each transferred to other offices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zbdachau.de/history/eng2.htm "The Dachau murder camp"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703062630/http://www.zbdachau.de/history/eng2.htm |date=2011-07-03 }} Retrieved May 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Himmler continued his efforts to establish [[summary execution]], then in practice only at Dachau, as a legitimate form of punishment.

== New camp order ==
[[Theodor Eicke]] was commissioned to develop a new camp order and a new regulations handbook.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Disciplinary procedures were added later to the regulations called the "Inspection of the concentration camps".&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the ''postenpflicht'' with instructions to fire on prisoners immediately and "without warning". Refusal to obey this order would bring serious consequences for camp personnel: summary dismissal and even arrest.

The "Regulations for Prisoner Escorts and Guards" (''Dienstvorschrift für die Begleitpersonen und Gefangenenbewachung'') were dated and went into effect on October 1, 1933&lt;ref name="stan"&gt;Stanislav Zámečník, ''Das war Dachau'' "Internationaler Militärgerichtshof IMG XXVI, Dok. 778-PS", pp. 40, 296 and 412. Comité International de Dachau, Luxemburg (2002) {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The infamous ''[[Lagerordnung]]'', the "Disciplinary and Penal Code for the Prison Camp" were issued on the same date.&lt;ref name="dachau1" /&gt; Also known as the ''Strafkatalog'' ("Penalty Catalogue"), this list of rules, infractions and punishments went into effect immediately, as well and both sets of regulations were made effective at all the SS concentration camps a few months later, on January 1, 1934. Together, the regulations allowed guards to mete out harsh punishments for even minor infractions and gave them wide latitude to execute prisoners and over time, devolved into a general system of terror punishment.&lt;ref name="sofsky"&gt;Wolfgang Sofsky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rf1VqMP3gMsC&amp;dq=the+order+of+terror+the+concentration+camp&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RHvpS9fkIs6bON358I0L&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Order of Terror: The Concentration Camp''] Translated by William Templar.

The perimeter of the detention camp grounds was marked by electrified fences and walls. Alongside the wall was a moat and next to that was an area called the "neutral zone".  Dubbed the "death strip" by prisoners, it was a forbidden area. A prisoner who even went near this area risked being shot by a guard invoking the ''postenpflicht''. Guards who shot a prisoner received a bounty and three days off. Guards, for their amusement and profit, would throw a prisoner's cap into the "death zone" and order the prisoner to get it "on the double" and then shoot the prisoner.&lt;ref name="wollheim"&gt;[http://www.wollheim-memorial.de/en/wachmannschaften_en "Guard Details"] Wollheim Memorial official website.

Prisoner work details outside a concentration camp were called ''Außenkommandos'' ("outside commandos") by the SS. The SS guards would form a ''postenkette'', a [[Kettling|cordon]] of guards to surround the work site and maintain watch. The imaginary boundary formed by the cordon was not to be crossed by a prisoner. Stepping outside the boundary was treated as an escape attempt and the guards, adhering to the ''postenpflicht'', were to fire without warning.&lt;ref name="wollheim" /&gt; If a prisoner did manage to escape, the SS guard was charged with "negligent release of a prisoner".

The ''postenpflicht'' was also valid for the [[SS-Totenkopfverbände]] that came to the concentration camps to serve as guards and auxiliary police.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Not just the SS-Death's Head Units, but also other SS men were employed as concentration camp guards, especially around the end of the war.&lt;/ref&gt; During the war years, [[Female guards in Nazi concentration camps|female guards]] were also employed at concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Barton, [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/THE+SHE+DEVILS%3B+Recorded+for+history:+The+women+of+Hitler's+death+...-a0139004839 "The She Devils; Recorded for history: The women of Hitler's death camps who tortured, maimed and murdered with glee"] From ''The Daily Mail'', London, England (November 22, 2005) Retrieved May 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; As overseers, they were also ordered to use their firearms in the case of physical attack by a prisoner or an escape attempt.

Reich Minister of Justice [[Franz Gurtner]] was in contact with [[Reichsführer-SS]] Himmler to mitigate the ''postenpflicht'' a bit, but he was unable to accomplish anything.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Sydnor, Jr., [https://books.google.com/books?id=QYU4QJsUWLYC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=gürtner+himmler&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-CsC_Du6jL&amp;sig=5J6PX9ByB5nP19XMn2VQtZ2chuo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YQrqS42HEsmmOMP5seQK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Soldiers of destruction: the SS Death's Head Division, 1933-1945"] See footnote, p. 20. Princeton University Press (1977) {{ISBN|0-691-05255-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camp commandants were also held accountable to the ''postenpflicht''. [[Karl Otto Koch]] was commandant at [[Majdanek concentration camp]] and on July 14, 1942, during his tenure, 200 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] escaped. Only half were later recaptured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holocaust-history.org/short-essays/majdanek.shtml "Majdanek"] Retrieved May 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1942, Koch was charged with "negligent release of a prisoner" and was reprimanded with a disciplinary transfer to the lesser job of ''[[Postschutz]]'' in [[Eger]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Klee, ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich: Wer war was vor und nach 1945.'', Frankfurt am Main (2007) p. 323 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Segev ''Die Soldaten des Bösen.

''Whoever allows a prisoner to escape will be arrested and charged with Negligent Prisoner Release and handed over to the [[Bavarian Political Police]].''

''If a prisoner attempts to escape, he is to be shot, without warning. A guard who shoots an escaping prisoner in the course of carrying out his duty, will not be reprimanded.

''Where a guard is physically attacked by a prisoner, the attack is to be repelled with use of a firearm, not return physical violence. A guard who does not comply with this order should expect his immediate dismissal. Besides, he who "keeps his back free"&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The original German is an idiom. To "keep one's back free" (''den Rücken freihalten'') means to get the grunt work out of the way so one is freed up for more important things.&lt;/ref&gt; will rarely be attacked.''

''In the event of a revolt or organized prisoner resistance, every guard supervising is to fire upon them. Warning shots are strictly prohibited.''&lt;ref name="stan" /&gt;

'''Mar Shimun XVI Yohannan''' (also '''Shemon XVI Yohannan''') was [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|Patriarch]] of the [[Konak, Hakkari|Qodshanis]] branch of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] from 1780, and since 1804 he remained the sole Catholicos-Patriarch, because the last patriarch of the rival ''Eliya line'' Eliya XIII Ishoyahb died without successor. Shimun XVI remained patriarch until his death in 1820.{{sfn|Baum|Winkler|2003|p=120, 175}}

Until 1804, there were two rival patriarchal lines within the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], senior ''Eliya line'' in [[Alqosh]] and junior ''Shemon line'' in [[Qochanis]]. Last patriarch of the senior line Eliya XIII Ishoyahb died in 1804 and was buried in the ancient [[Rabban Hormizd Monastery]]. Since he had no successor, Shimun XVI Yohannan of the junior line became the sole Catholicos-Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East. {{sfn|Wilmshurst|2000|p=316-319, 356}}

The snowball-Earth episodes are proposed to have occurred before the sudden radiation of multicellular bioforms, known as the [[Cambrian explosion]]. The most recent snowball episode may have triggered the evolution of multicellularity. Another, much earlier and longer snowball episode, the [[Huronian glaciation]], which would have occurred 2400 to 2100&amp;nbsp;Mya, may have been triggered by the first appearance of oxygen in the atmosphere, the "[[Great Oxygenation Event]]".

==History==
{{Life timeline}}

===Evidence for ancient glaciation mounts===
Long before the idea of a global glaciation was established, a series of discoveries began to accumulate evidence for ancient Precambrian glaciations. The first of these discoveries was published in 1871 by J. Thomson who found ancient glacier-reworked material ([[tillite]]) in [[Islay]], Scotland. Similar findings followed in Australia (1884) and India (1887). A fourth and very illustrative finding that came to be known as "[[Reusch's Moraine]]" was reported by [[Hans Reusch]] in northern Norway in 1891. Many other findings followed, but their understanding was hampered by the rejection of [[continental drift]].&lt;ref name=Hoffman2011&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hoffman |first1=Paul F.|author-link=Paul F. Hoffman|editor-last=Arnaud|editor-first=E. |editor-last2=Halverson|editor-first2=G.P.|editor-last3=Shields-Zhou|editor-first3=G. |date=2011 |title=The Geological Record of Neoproterozoic Glaciations |url= |chapter=A history of Neoproterozoic glacial geology, 1871–1997 |volume= |issue=36 |pages=17–37 |doi= |access-date=|series=Geological Society, London, Memoirs|publisher=Geological Society of London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global glaciation proposed===
Sir [[Douglas Mawson]] (1882–1958), an Australian geologist and Antarctic explorer, spent much of his career studying the [[Neoproterozoic]] [[stratigraphy]] of South Australia, where he identified thick and extensive glacial sediments and late in his career speculated about the possibility of global glaciation.&lt;ref name="Mawson"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alderman | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Tilley | first2 = C. E. | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1960.0011 | title = [[Douglas Mawson]] 1882-1958 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 5 | pages = 119–127 | year = 1960 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mawson's ideas of global glaciation, however, were based on the mistaken assumption that the geographic position of Australia, and that of other continents where low-latitude glacial deposits are found, has remained constant through time. With the advancement of the [[continental drift]] hypothesis, and eventually [[plate tectonic]] theory, came an easier explanation for the glaciogenic sediments—they were deposited at a point in time when the continents were at higher latitudes.

In 1964, the idea of global-scale glaciation reemerged when [[W. Brian Harland]] published a paper in which he presented [[palaeomagnetic]] data showing that glacial [[till]]ites in [[Svalbard]] and [[Greenland]] were deposited at tropical latitudes.&lt;ref name="Harland"&gt;{{cite journal
| author=W. B. Harland
| title=Critical evidence for a great infra-Cambrian glaciation
| journal=[[International Journal of Earth Sciences]]
| year=1964
| volume=54
| issue=1
| pages=45–61
| bibcode=1964GeoRu..54...45H
| doi=10.1007/BF01821169}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this palaeomagnetic data, and the sedimentological evidence that the glacial sediments interrupt successions of rocks commonly associated with tropical to temperate latitudes, he argued for an [[ice age]] that was so extreme that it resulted in the deposition of marine glacial rocks in the tropics.

In the 1960s, [[Mikhail Budyko]], a Russian climatologist, developed a simple energy-balance climate model to investigate the effect of ice cover on global [[climate]]. Using this model, Budyko found that if ice sheets advanced far enough out of the polar regions, a feedback loop ensued where the increased reflectiveness ([[albedo]]) of the ice led to further cooling and the formation of more ice, until the entire Earth was covered in ice and stabilized in a new ice-covered equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Budyko"&gt;{{cite journal

While Budyko's model showed that this ice-albedo stability could happen, he concluded that it had in fact never happened, because his model offered no way to escape from such a feedback loop. In 1971, Aron Faegre, an American physicist, showed that a similar energy-balance model predicted three stable global climates, one of which was snowball earth.&lt;ref name="Faegre"&gt;{{cite journal

This model introduced [[Edward Norton Lorenz]]'s concept of intransitivity indicating that there could be a major jump from one climate to another, including to snowball earth.

The term "snowball Earth" was coined by [[Joseph Kirschvink]] in a short paper published in 1992 within a lengthy volume concerning the biology of the [[Proterozoic]] eon.&lt;ref name="Kirschvink" /&gt; The major contributions from this work were: (1) the recognition that the presence of [[banded iron formation]]s is consistent with such a global glacial episode, and (2) the introduction of a mechanism by which to escape from a completely ice-covered Earth—specifically, the accumulation of {{co2}} from volcanic outgassing leading to an ultra-[[greenhouse effect]].

[[Franklyn Van Houten]]'s discovery of a consistent geological pattern in which lake levels rose and fell is now known as the "Van Houten cycle". His studies of phosphorus deposits and [[banded iron formations]] in sedimentary rocks made him an early adherent of the "snowball Earth" hypothesis postulating that the planet's surface froze more than 650 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S28/44/69O99/index.xml?section=topstories Princeton University - Franklyn Van Houten, expert on sedimentary rocks, dies at 96&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in the notion of a snowball Earth increased dramatically after [[Paul F. Hoffman]] and his co-workers applied Kirschvink's ideas to a succession of Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in [[Namibia]] and elaborated upon the hypothesis in the journal ''Science'' in 1998 by incorporating such observations as the occurrence of [[cap carbonate]]s.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the equator. Therefore, the presence of glacial deposits within the [[tropics]] suggests global ice cover.

Critical to an assessment of the validity of the theory, therefore, is an understanding of the reliability and significance of the evidence that led to the belief that ice ever reached the tropics. This evidence must prove two things:
# that a bed contains sedimentary structures that could have been created only by glacial activity;
# that the bed lay within the tropics when it was deposited.

During a period of global glaciation, it must also be demonstrated that glaciers were active at different global locations at the same time, and that no other deposits of the same age are in existence.

This last point is very difficult to prove. Before the [[Ediacaran]], the [[biostratigraphy|biostratigraphic]] markers usually used to correlate rocks are absent; therefore there is no way to prove that rocks in different places across the globe were deposited at precisely the same time. The best that can be done is to estimate the age of the rocks using [[radiometry|radiometric]] methods, which are rarely accurate to better than a million years or so.&lt;ref name=Eyles2004/&gt;

The first two points are often the source of contention on a case-to-case basis. Many glacial features can also be created by non-glacial means, and estimating the approximate latitudes of landmasses even as recently as {{Ma|200}} can be riddled with difficulties.&lt;ref name=Briden1971&gt;{{cite journal

===Palaeomagnetism===
The snowball Earth hypothesis was first posited to explain what were then considered to be glacial deposits near the equator. Since tectonic plates move slowly over time, ascertaining their position at a given point in Earth's long history is not easy. In addition to considerations of how the recognizable landmasses could have fit together, the latitude at which a rock was deposited can be constrained by palaeomagnetism.

When [[sedimentary rock]]s form, magnetic minerals within them tend to align themselves with the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. Through the precise measurement of this [[palaeomagnetism]], it is possible to estimate the [[latitude]] (but not the [[longitude]]) where the rock matrix was formed. Palaeomagnetic measurements have indicated that some sediments of glacial origin in the [[Neoproterozoic]] rock record were deposited within 10 degrees of the equator,&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the accuracy of this reconstruction is in question.&lt;ref name=Eyles2004 /&gt; This palaeomagnetic location of apparently glacial sediments (such as [[dropstone]]s) has been taken to suggest that glaciers extended from land to sea level in tropical latitudes at the time the sediments were deposited.

Skeptics suggest that the palaeomagnetic data could be corrupted if Earth's ancient magnetic field was substantially different from today's. Depending on the rate of cooling of Earth's core, it is possible that during the Proterozoic, the [[magnetic field]] did not approximate a simple [[dipole|dipolar]] distribution, with north and south magnetic poles roughly aligning with the planet's axis as they do today. Instead, a hotter core may have circulated more vigorously and given rise to 4, 8 or more poles. Palaeomagnetic data would then have to be re-interpreted, as the sedimentary minerals could have aligned pointing to a 'West Pole' rather than the North Pole. Alternatively, Earth's dipolar field could have been oriented such that the poles were close to the equator. This hypothesis has been posited to explain the extraordinarily rapid motion of the magnetic poles implied by the Ediacaran palaeomagnetic record; the alleged motion of the north pole would occur around the same time as the Gaskiers glaciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2010.02.038| title = Incompatible Ediacaran paleomagnetic directions suggest an equatorial geomagnetic dipole hypothesis| year = 2010| last1 = Abrajevitch | first1 = A.| last2 = Van Der Voo | first2 = R.| journal = Earth and Planetary Science Letters| volume = 293| issue = 1–2| pages = 164–170| bibcode=2010E&amp;PSL.293..164A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another weakness of reliance on palaeomagnetic data is the difficulty in determining whether the magnetic signal recorded is original, or whether it has been reset by later activity. For example, a mountain-building [[orogeny]] releases hot water as a by-product of metamorphic reactions; this water can circulate to rocks thousands of kilometers away and reset their magnetic signature. This makes the authenticity of rocks older than a few million years difficult to determine without painstaking mineralogical observations.&lt;ref

Sedimentary rocks that are deposited by glaciers have distinctive features that enable their identification. Long before the advent of the ''snowball Earth'' hypothesis many [[Neoproterozoic]] sediments had been interpreted as having a glacial origin, including some apparently at tropical latitudes at the time of their deposition. However, it is worth remembering that many sedimentary features traditionally associated with glaciers can also be formed by other means.&lt;ref name=Arnaud2002&gt;{{cite journal

It appears that some deposits formed during the snowball period could only have formed in the presence of an active hydrological cycle.

===Carbon isotope ratios===
There are two stable [[isotope]]s of carbon in [[sea water]]: [[carbon-12]] (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C) and the rare [[carbon-13]] (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C), which makes up about 1.109 percent of carbon atoms.

Biochemical processes, of which [[photosynthesis]] is one, tend to preferentially incorporate the lighter &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C isotope. Thus ocean-dwelling photosynthesizers, both [[protist]]s and [[algae]], tend to be very slightly depleted in &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, relative to the abundance found in the primary [[volcanic]] sources of Earth's carbon. Therefore, an ocean with photosynthetic life will have a lower &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C ratio within organic remains, and a higher ratio in corresponding ocean water. The organic component of the lithified sediments will remain very slightly, but measurably, depleted in &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C.

During the proposed episode of snowball Earth, there are rapid and extreme negative excursions in the ratio of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C to &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C.&lt;ref name=Rothman2003&gt;{{cite journal |author1=D.H.

===Banded iron formations===
[[Image:Black-band ironstone (aka).jpg|thumb|2.1 billion-year-old rock with black-band ironstone]]
[[Banded iron formations]] (BIF) are sedimentary rocks of layered [[iron oxide]] and iron-poor [[chert]]. In the presence of oxygen, [[iron]] naturally rusts and becomes insoluble in water. The banded iron formations are commonly very old and their deposition is often related to the oxidation of the Earth's atmosphere during the [[Palaeoproterozoic]] era, when dissolved iron in the ocean came in contact with photosynthetically produced oxygen and precipitated out as iron oxide.

The bands were produced at the [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]] between an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] and an oxygenated ocean. Since today's atmosphere is [[oxygen]]-rich (nearly 21% by volume) and in contact with the oceans, it is not possible to accumulate enough iron oxide to deposit a banded formation. The only extensive iron formations that were deposited after the Palaeoproterozoic (after 1.8 billion years ago) are associated with [[Cryogenian]] glacial deposits.

For such iron-rich rocks to be deposited there would have to be anoxia in the ocean, so that much dissolved iron (as [[ferrous oxide]]) could accumulate before it met an oxidant that would precipitate it as [[ferric]] oxide. For the ocean to become anoxic it must have limited gas exchange with the oxygenated atmosphere. Proponents of the hypothesis argue that the reappearance of BIF in the sedimentary record is a result of limited oxygen levels in an ocean sealed by sea-ice,&lt;ref name="Kirschvink"&gt;{{cite book

Being isolated from the oceans, such lakes could have been stagnant and anoxic at depth, much like today's [[Black Sea]]; a sufficient input of iron could provide the necessary conditions for BIF formation.&lt;ref name=Eyles2004 /&gt; A further difficulty in suggesting that BIFs marked the end of the glaciation is that they are found interbedded with glacial sediments.&lt;ref name=Young1995/&gt; BIFs are also strikingly absent during the [[Marinoan glaciation]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

=== Cap carbonate rocks ===
[[Image:Grosser Aletschgletscher 3178.JPG|thumb|left|A present-day glacier]]

The formation of such sedimentary rocks could be caused by a large influx of positively charged [[ions]], as would be produced by rapid weathering during the extreme greenhouse following a snowball Earth event. The {{delta|13|C|link}} isotopic signature of the cap carbonates is near −5&amp;nbsp;‰, consistent with the value of the mantle—such a low value is usually/could be taken to signify an absence of life, since photosynthesis usually acts to raise the value; alternatively the release of methane deposits could have lowered it from a higher value, and counterbalance the effects of photosynthesis.

The precise mechanism involved in the formation of cap carbonates is not clear, but the most cited explanation suggests that at the melting of a snowball Earth, water would dissolve the abundant {{co2}} from the [[atmosphere]] to form [[carbonic acid]], which would fall as [[acid rain]]. This would weather exposed [[silicate]] and [[carbonate]] [[rock (geology)|rock]] (including readily attacked glacial debris), releasing large amounts of [[calcium]], which when washed into the ocean would form distinctively textured layers of carbonate sedimentary rock. Such an [[abiotic]] "[[cap carbonate]]" sediment can be found on top of the glacial till that gave rise to the snowball Earth hypothesis.

However, there are some problems with the designation of a glacial origin to cap carbonates. Firstly, the high carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere would cause the oceans to become acidic, and dissolve any carbonates contained within—starkly at odds with the deposition of cap carbonates. Further, the thickness of some cap carbonates is far above what could reasonably be produced in the relatively quick deglaciations. The cause is further weakened by the lack of cap carbonates above many sequences of clear glacial origin at a similar time and the occurrence of similar carbonates within the sequences of proposed glacial origin.&lt;ref name=Eyles2004 /&gt; An alternative mechanism, which may have produced the [[Doushantuo]] cap carbonate at least, is the rapid, widespread release of methane. This accounts for incredibly low—as low as −48&amp;nbsp;‰—{{delta|13|C|}} values—as well as unusual sedimentary features which appear to have been formed by the flow of gas through the sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Changing acidity===
Isotopes of the element [[boron]] suggest that the [[pH]] of the oceans dropped dramatically before and after the [[Marinoan]] glaciation.&lt;ref name=Kasemann2005&gt;δ&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B, in {{cite journal

This may indicate a buildup of [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere, some of which would dissolve into the oceans to form [[carbonic acid]]. Although the boron variations may be evidence of extreme [[climate change]], they need not imply a global glaciation.

===Space dust===
Earth's surface is very depleted in the element [[iridium]], which primarily resides in the [[Inner core|Earth's core]]. The only significant source of the element at the surface is [[cosmogenic|cosmic particles]] that reach Earth. During a snowball Earth, iridium would accumulate on the ice sheets, and when the ice melted the resulting layer of sediment would be rich in iridium. An [[iridium anomaly]] has been discovered at the base of the cap carbonate formations, and has been used to suggest that the glacial episode lasted for at least 3 million years,&lt;ref name=Bodiselitsch&gt;{{cite journal

===Cyclic climate fluctuations===
Using the ratio of mobile [[cation]]s to those that remain in soils during [[chemical weathering]] (the chemical index of alteration), it has been shown that chemical weathering varied in a cyclic fashion within a glacial succession, increasing during interglacial periods and decreasing during cold and arid glacial periods.&lt;ref name="Rieu"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of these deposits is highly reliant upon their dating. Glacial sediments are difficult to date, and the closest dated bed to the Portaskaig group is 8&amp;nbsp;km stratigraphically above the beds of interest. Its dating to 600&amp;nbsp;Ma means the beds can be tentatively correlated to the Sturtian glaciation, but they may represent the advance or retreat of a snowball Earth.

==Mechanisms==
[[Image:SnowballSimulations.jpg|350px|thumb|right|One computer simulation of conditions during a snowball Earth period&lt;ref name=NatureAttrib&gt;Reprinted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd.: Nature 405:425-429, copyright 2000. See Hyde ''et al.'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The initiation of a snowball Earth event would involve some initial cooling mechanism, which would result in an increase in Earth's coverage of snow and ice. The increase in Earth's coverage of snow and ice would in turn increase Earth's [[albedo]], which would result in [[positive feedback]] for cooling. If enough snow and ice accumulates, run-away cooling would result. This positive feedback is facilitated by an equatorial continental distribution, which would allow ice to accumulate in the regions closer to the equator, where [[solar radiation]] is most direct.

Many possible triggering mechanisms could account for the beginning of a snowball Earth, such as the eruption of a [[supervolcano]], a reduction in the atmospheric concentration of [[greenhouse gas]]es such as [[methane]] and/or [[carbon dioxide]], changes in [[solar variation|Solar energy output]], or perturbations of [[Earth's orbit]]. Regardless of the trigger, initial cooling results in an increase in the area of Earth's surface covered by ice and snow, and the additional ice and snow reflects more Solar energy back to space, further cooling Earth and further increasing the area of Earth's surface covered by ice and snow. This positive feedback loop could eventually produce a frozen [[equator]] as cold as modern [[Antarctica]].

[[Global warming]] associated with large accumulations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over millions of years, emitted primarily by volcanic activity, is the proposed trigger for melting a snowball Earth. Due to positive feedback for melting, the eventual melting of the snow and ice covering most of Earth's surface would require as little as a millennium.

===Continental distribution===
A tropical distribution of the continents is, perhaps counter-intuitively, necessary to allow the initiation of a snowball Earth.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2005/&gt;
Firstly, tropical continents are more reflective than open ocean, and so absorb less of the Sun's heat: most absorption of Solar energy on Earth today occurs in tropical oceans.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen2001&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, tropical continents are subject to more rainfall, which leads to increased river discharge—and erosion.
When exposed to air, [[silicate]] rocks undergo weathering reactions which remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. These reactions proceed in the general form: Rock-forming mineral + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → cations + bicarbonate + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. An example of such a reaction is the weathering of [[wollastonite]]:
: CaSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The released [[calcium]] cations react with the dissolved [[bicarbonate]] in the ocean to form [[calcium carbonate]] as a chemically precipitated [[sedimentary rock]]. This transfers [[carbon dioxide]], a greenhouse gas, from the air into the [[geosphere]], and, in steady-state on geologic time scales, offsets the carbon dioxide emitted from [[volcano]]es into the atmosphere.

A paucity of suitable sediments for analysis makes precise continental distribution during the Neoproterozoic difficult to establish.&lt;ref name=Meert2004&gt;{{cite journal

Additional factors that may have contributed to the onset of the Neoproterozoic snowball include the introduction of atmospheric free oxygen, which may have reached sufficient quantities to react with [[Atmospheric methane|methane in the atmosphere]], oxidizing it to carbon dioxide, a much weaker greenhouse gas,&lt;ref name=Kerr1999&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a younger—thus fainter—Sun, which would have emitted 6 percent less radiation in the Neoproterozoic.&lt;ref name=Eyles2004 /&gt;

Normally, as Earth gets colder due to natural climatic fluctuations and changes in incoming solar radiation, the cooling slows these weathering reactions. As a result, less carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and Earth warms as this greenhouse gas accumulates—this '[[negative feedback]]' process limits the magnitude of cooling. During the [[Cryogenian]] period, however, Earth's continents were all at [[Tropics|tropical]] latitudes, which made this moderating process less effective, as high weathering rates continued on land even as Earth cooled. This let ice advance beyond the polar regions. Once ice advanced to within 30° of the equator,&lt;ref name=Kirschvink2002&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a positive feedback could ensue such that the increased reflectiveness ([[albedo]]) of the ice led to further cooling and the formation of more ice, until the whole Earth is ice-covered.

Polar continents, due to low rates of [[evaporation]], are too dry to allow substantial carbon deposition—restricting the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide that can be removed from the [[carbon cycle]]. A gradual rise of the proportion of the [[isotope]] carbon-13 relative to carbon-12 in sediments pre-dating "global" glaciation indicates that {{co2}} draw-down before snowball Earths was a slow and continuous process.&lt;ref name=Schrag2002&gt;{{cite journal

The resulting sediments supplied to the ocean would be high in nutrients such as [[phosphorus]], which combined with the abundance of {{co2}} would trigger a [[cyanobacteria]] population explosion, which would cause a relatively rapid reoxygenation of the atmosphere, which may have contributed to the rise of the [[Ediacaran biota]] and the subsequent [[Cambrian explosion]]—a higher oxygen concentration allowing large multicellular lifeforms to develop. Although the [[positive feedback]] loop would melt the ice in geological short order, perhaps less than 1,000 years, replenishment of atmospheric oxygen and depletion of the {{co2}} levels would take further [[millennium|millennia]].

It is possible that carbon dioxide levels fell enough for Earth to freeze again; this cycle may have repeated until the [[continental drift|continents had drifted]] to more polar latitudes.&lt;ref name=Hoffman1999&gt;{{cite journal

More recent evidence suggests that with colder oceanic temperatures, the resulting higher ability of the oceans to dissolve gases led to the carbon content of sea water being more quickly oxidized to carbon dioxide. This leads directly to an increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide, enhanced greenhouse warming of Earth's surface, and the prevention of a total snowball state.&lt;ref&gt;Peltier, W.

During millions of years, [[cryoconite]] would have accumulated on and inside the ice. [[Psychrophile|Psychrophilic]] microorganisms, volcanic ash and dust from ice-free locations would settle on ice covering several million square kilometers. Once the ice started to melt, these layers would become visible and coloring the icy surfaces dark, helping to accelerate the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=27422766 | doi=10.1111/gbi.12191 | volume=14 | title=Cryoconite pans on Snowball Earth: supraglacial oases for Cryogenian eukaryotes? | year=2016 | journal=Geobiology | pages=531–542 | author=Hoffman PF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultraviolet light from the Sun would also produce hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) when it hits water molecules. Normally hydrogen peroxide is broken down by sunlight, but some would have been trapped inside the ice. When the glaciers started to melt, it would have been released in both the ocean and the atmosphere, where it was split into water and oxygen molecules, leading to an increase in atmospheric oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10662-did-snowball-earths-melting-let-oxygen-fuel-life/ Did snowball Earth’s melting let oxygen fuel life?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slushball Earth hypothesis===
While the presence of glaciers is not disputed, the idea that the entire planet was covered in ice is more contentious, leading some scientists to posit a "slushball Earth", in which a band of ice-free, or ice-thin, waters remains around the [[equator]], allowing for a continued [[hydrologic cycle]].

This hypothesis appeals to scientists who observe certain features of the sedimentary record that can only be formed under open water, or rapidly moving ice (which would require somewhere ice-free to move to). Recent research observed geochemical cyclicity in [[clastic rocks]], showing that the "snowball" periods were punctuated by warm spells, similar to [[ice age]] cycles in recent Earth history. Attempts to construct computer models of a snowball Earth have also struggled to accommodate global ice cover without fundamental changes in the laws and constants which govern the planet.

A less extreme snowball Earth hypothesis involves continually evolving continental configurations and changes in ocean circulation.&lt;ref name=Harland2007&gt;{{cite journal

==="Zipper rift" hypothesis===
&lt;!-- I don't feel I've done this paper justice here; it may be because I've not grasped it fully, but may also be that their model's not quite as awe-inspiring as it's made out to be. Please do feel free to have a look at the paper—message Verisimilus if you can't find it online—and improve this section if you feel you can! --&gt;
Nick Eyles suggest that the Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth was in fact no different from any other glaciation in Earth's history, and that efforts to find a single cause are likely to end in failure.&lt;ref name=Eyles2004 /&gt; The "Zipper rift" hypothesis proposes two pulses of continental "unzipping"—first, the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia, forming the proto-Pacific Ocean; then the splitting of the continent [[Baltica]] from [[Laurentia]], forming the proto-Atlantic—coincided with the glaciated periods.
The associated tectonic uplift would form high plateaus, just as the [[East African Rift]] is responsible for high topography; this high ground could then host glaciers.

Banded iron formations have been taken as unavoidable evidence for global ice cover, since they require dissolved iron ions and anoxic waters to form; however, the limited extent of the Neoproterozoic banded iron deposits means that they may not have formed in frozen oceans, but instead in inland seas. Such seas can experience a wide range of chemistries; high rates of evaporation could concentrate iron ions, and a periodic lack of circulation could allow anoxic bottom water to form.

Continental rifting, with associated subsidence, tends to produce such landlocked water bodies. This rifting, and associated subsidence, would produce the space for the fast deposition of sediments, negating the need for an immense and rapid melting to raise the global sea levels.

===High-obliquity hypothesis===
A competing hypothesis to explain the presence of ice on the equatorial continents was that Earth's [[axial tilt]] was quite high, in the vicinity of 60°, which would place Earth's land in high "latitudes", although supporting evidence is scarce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url= http://www.livescience.com/7105-day-earth-fell.html
| title= LiveScience.com: The Day The Earth Fell Over}}&lt;/ref&gt; A less extreme possibility would be that it was merely Earth's [[Poles of astronomical bodies|magnetic pole]] that wandered to this inclination, as the magnetic readings which suggested ice-filled continents depends on the magnetic and rotational poles being relatively similar. In either of these two situations, the freeze would be limited to relatively small areas, as is the case today; severe changes to Earth's climate are not necessary.

This hypothesis, created to explain palaeomagnetic data, suggests that Earth's axis of rotation shifted one or more times during the general time-frame attributed to snowball Earth.

Several alternative explanations for the evidence have been proposed.

==Survival of life through frozen periods==
[[Image:Blacksmoker in Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|right|A [[black smoker]], a type of hydrothermal vent]]
A tremendous glaciation would curtail photosynthetic life on Earth, thus depleting atmospheric oxygen, and thereby allowing non-oxidized iron-rich rocks to form.

Detractors argue that this kind of glaciation would have made life extinct entirely. However, microfossils such as [[stromatolite]]s and [[oncolite]]s prove that, in shallow marine environments at least, life did not suffer any perturbation. Instead life developed a trophic complexity and survived the cold period unscathed.&lt;ref name=Corsetti2003&gt;{{cite journal

==Implications==
A snowball Earth has profound implications in the history of [[life]] on Earth. While many [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] have been postulated, global ice cover would certainly have ravaged [[ecosystem]]s dependent on sunlight. Geochemical evidence from rocks associated with low-latitude glacial deposits have been interpreted to show a crash in oceanic life during the glacials.

Because about half of the oceans' water was frozen solid as ice, the remaining water would be twice as salty as it is today, lowering its freezing point. When the ice sheet melted, it would cover the oceans with a layer of hot freshwater up to 2 kilometres thick. Only after the hot surface water mixed with the colder and deeper saltwater did the sea return to a warmer and less salty state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/2130525-snowball-earth-melting-led-to-freshwater-ocean-2-kilometres-deep/ Snowball Earth melting led to freshwater ocean 2 kilometres deep]&lt;/ref&gt;

The melting of the ice may have presented many new opportunities for diversification, and may indeed have driven the rapid evolution which took place at the end of the [[Cryogenian]] period.

===Effect on early evolution===
[[Image:DickinsoniaCostata.jpg|thumb|right|222px|''[[Dickinsonia]] costata'', an [[Ediacaran]] organism of unknown affinity, with a quilted appearance]]
The [[Neoproterozoic]] was a time of remarkable diversification of multicellular organisms, including animals. Organism size and complexity increased considerably after the end of the snowball glaciations. This development of multicellular organisms may have been the result of increased evolutionary pressures resulting from multiple [[Greenhouse and icehouse Earth|icehouse-hothouse]] cycles; in this sense, snowball Earth episodes may have "pumped" evolution. Alternatively, fluctuating nutrient levels and rising oxygen may have played a part. Another major glacial episode may have ended just a few million years before the [[Cambrian explosion]].

Mechanistically, the effect of snowball Earth (in particular the later glaciations) on complex life is likely to have occurred through the process of [[kin selection]]. Organ-scale differentiation, in particular the terminal (irreversible) differentiation present in animals, requires the individual cell (and the genes contained within it) to "sacrifice" their ability to reproduce, so that the colony is not disrupted. From the short-term perspective of the gene, more offspring will be gained by causing the cell in which it is contained to ignore any signals received from the colony, and to reproduce at the maximum rate, regardless of the implications for the wider group. Today, this incentive explains the formation of tumours in animals and plants.

It has been argued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1472-4669.2007.00115.x|url=http://researchpages.net/media/resources/2007/06/21/richtimhywelfinal.pdf|title=Neoproterozoic 'snowball Earth' glaciations and the evolution of altruism|vauthors=Boyle RA, Lenton TM, ((Williams HTP)) |journal=Geobiology|year=2007|accessdate=17 June 2011|volume=5|issue=4|pages=337–349}}&lt;/ref&gt; that because snowball Earth would undoubtedly have decimated the population size of any given species, the extremely small populations that resulted would all have been descended from a small number of individuals (see [[founder effect]]), and consequently the average relatedness between any two individuals (in this case individual cells) would have been exceptionally high as a result of glaciations. Altruism is known to increase from rarity when relatedness (R) exceeds the ratio of the cost (C) to the altruist (in this case, the cell giving up its own reproduction by differentiating), to the benefit (B) to the recipient of altruism (the germ line of the colony, that reproduces as a result of the differentiation), i.e. R &gt; C/B (see [[Hamilton's rule]]). The evolutionary pressure of the high relatedness in the context of a post-glaciation population boom may have been sufficient to overcome the reproductive cost of forming a complex animal, for the first time in Earth's history.

There is also a rival hypothesis which has been gaining currency in recent years: that early snowball Earths did not so much ''affect'' the evolution of life on Earth as result from it. In fact the two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. The idea is that Earth's life forms affect the global carbon cycle and so major evolutionary events alter the carbon cycle, redistributing carbon within various reservoirs within the biosphere system and in the process temporarily lowering the atmospheric (greenhouse) carbon reservoir until the revised biosphere system settled into a new state. The Snowball I episode (of the [[Huronian glaciation]] 2.4 to 2.1 billion years) and Snowball II (of the Precambrian's [[Cryogenian]] between 580–850 million years and which itself had a number of distinct episodes) are respectively thought to be caused by the evolution of [[Carbon fixation#Oxygenic photosynthesis|oxygenic photosynthesis]] and then the rise of more advanced multicellular animal life and life's colonization of the land.&lt;ref&gt;Cowie, J., (2007) ''Climate Change: Biological and Human Aspects''.

==Occurrence and timing==

===Neoproterozoic===
There were three or four significant ice ages during the late [[Neoproterozoic]]. Of these, the [[Marinoan glaciation|Marinoan]] was the most significant, and the [[Sturtian glaciation|Sturtian]] glaciations were also truly widespread.&lt;ref name=Stern2006&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it was probably as intense as the [[late Ordovician glaciation]]. The status of the [[Kaigas]] "glaciation" or "cooling event" is currently unclear; some scientists do not recognise it as a glacial, others suspect that it may reflect poorly dated strata of Sturtian association, and others believe it may indeed be a third ice age.&lt;ref name=Smith2008&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = A.

Emerging evidence suggests that the Earth underwent a number of glaciations during the Neoproterozoic, which would stand strongly at odds with the snowball hypothesis.&lt;ref name=nature_geo/&gt;

===Palaeoproterozoic===
{{main|Huronian glaciation}}

The snowball Earth hypothesis has been invoked to explain glacial deposits in the [[Huronian Supergroup]] of Canada, though the palaeomagnetic evidence that suggests ice sheets at low latitudes is contested.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite journal

As the [[Sun]] was notably weaker at the time, Earth's climate may have relied on methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, to maintain surface temperatures above freezing.

In the absence of this methane greenhouse, temperatures plunged and a snowball event could have occurred.&lt;ref name="Kopp"&gt;{{cite journal

===Karoo Ice Age===
Before the theory of continental drift, glacial deposits in [[Carboniferous]] strata in tropical continents areas such as India and South America led to speculation that the [[Karoo Ice Age]] glaciation reached into the tropics. However, a continental reconstruction shows that ice was in fact constrained to the polar parts of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]].
