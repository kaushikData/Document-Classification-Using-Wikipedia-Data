[[Image:White shark.jpg|250px|thumb|A great white shark]]
The '''1992 cage-less shark-diving expedition''' was the world's first recorded intentionally cage-less dive with [[great white shark]]s, contributing to a change in public opinions about the supposed ferocity of these animals.

==History==
The dive took place in January 1992, during the filming of the National Geographic documentary ''Blue Wilderness'', at [[Gansbaai#Dyer Island, Geyser Rock and Shark Alley|Dyer Island]], [[South Africa]]. After 8-10 large Great White sharks had been kept around their boat for about 6 hours using [[chumming|chum]] and sea mammal flesh, four [[scuba divers]] carried out the world's first dive amongst these animals without a safety cage, or any other protection, like chain-mail suits. The divers were [[Ron &amp; Valerie Taylor]], notable Australian film-makers and pioneers of underwater exploration, their friend George Askew, a South African diver and photographer, and Piet 'PJ' van der Walt, who had founded the South African cage-diving industry in 1988. 
           
The Taylors and Askew, recognised shark experts and authorities, were testing their hypothesis that these animals had a much fiercer reputation than they deserved. Their hypothesis was based on many years of experiences with various types of shark, including face to face encounters underwater. In 1978, Askew had written an article entitled "The Jaws fish - Myth or Maneater?", published in the UK magazine ''Underwater World'', proposing that Great Whites did not deserve the horrific image and reputation that ''Jaws'' author [[Peter Benchley]] and film director [[Steven Spielberg]] had imprinted in peoples minds. Askew postulated that, as they rely on stealth and surprise when attacking, Great Whites would be unlikely to attack if you were aware of their presence. He had two more articles on the same subject published in 1983 and 1991, and then went on to prove that point with the historic dive in 1992.

Whilst surface testing of the prototype "Shark POD" [[Protective Oceanic Device]] (now Shark Shield) for the [[Natal Sharks Board]], the divers discovered that despite having been excited for hours previously by large amounts of blood-laden chum (mashed fish, blood and oil) and chunks of dolphin and [[whale meat]] from washed up carcasses, the sharks were actually very shy and difficult to approach, even scared of these unknown intruders. After a long 20 minute wait, the divers had several timid encounters with the very cautious sharks and were never at any time challenged, nor made to feel uneasy. This ground-breaking "Underwater Everest" conquest, a huge leap forward in ocean exploration, strongly challenged the idea of the Great White as a "Mindless Monster" eating machine, and changed the way the world viewed sharks.

The Taylors felt that the Australian sharks may have a slightly different disposition to South African ones, but as it is now known that Great Whites swim between South Africa and Australia, this is open to debate. On two occasions many years before, they had released Great Whites trapped in wire ropes from cages without being harassed, despite touching the animals.

Askew had encountered Great White Sharks several times previously over the years whilst spear-fishing. The first was in 1960, when meeting one was considered to mean certain death. This encounter was with a very gravid female who had come into a small cove to drop her pup/s. She was in such an advanced stage of pregnancy that her body was distorted, with her mouth actually facing forward above her hugely distended stomach. She was what is referred to as a "Drop-Gut". In the animal world a mother is usually very protective and aggressive just before and just after giving birth, and yet this large Apex Predator showed no aggression towards him. Because of this and similar encounters, and those of his colleagues, he became more interested in this question.

Just before the dive, Askew and Ron Taylor were kneeling on the dive platform a few centimetres above water, with their hands in the water filming. Askew stood up and stepped back, and at that moment a four-metre Great White slid onto the platform and stopped 3 inches from his foot before sliding back, but made no attempt to snap or lunge at him. It would have taken his camera and arms, and maybe pulled him in if he had not got up. Askew sees that incident as pure opportunism and not savagery.

The Prototype 'Pod" Valerie is seen wearing during this dive was a dummy for continuity and afforded the divers no protection.

That first close encounter dive demonstrated that Great Whites are not built only to devour people but are very curious and can be quite 'friendly'. This dive is directly responsible for the upsurge in Shark Tourism – especially free-diving (i.e. Out of cage swimming) with big sharks. When existing and potential operators around the world learnt of the theory that the Great White was quite approachable and not likely to attack, it was hypothesised that the same applied to other dangerous sharks such as [[tiger shark]]s, [[bull shark]]s and [[oceanic whitetip shark]]s. This proved to be the case and [[Great white shark#shark tourism|shark tourism]] began to expand rapidly. It is now a multibillion-dollar a year industry, and has provided a lot of useful insights into sharks.

Since this dive some divers have attempted cage-less dives with big sharks, even hitching rides on their dorsal fins and touching them underwater. However, such attempts are not recommended as sharks are still Apex Predators and very opportunistic. Although there have never been any serious incidents from free-swimming with Great Whites, the same cannot be said for other sharks. There have been a number of fatalities and other injuries.

The '''Association of North East Councils''' was a partnership body made up of representatives of local authorities in [[North East England]]. It was a regional grouping of the [[Local Government Association]].

In April 2009 it assumed the role of the regional [[Local Authority Leaders’ Board]] following the abolition of the [[North East Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategyintegrationne.co.uk/default.asp |title=Strategyintegrationne.co.uk |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831044158/http://www.strategyintegrationne.co.uk/default.asp |archivedate=2009-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It closed in March 2016,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northeastcouncils.gov.uk/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228063123/http://www.northeastcouncils.gov.uk/ |date=2009-02-28 }} Retrieved 31 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; following the creation of a [[North East Combined Authority]], which comprises local authorities outside of Tees Valley; with Tees Valley local authorities forming the separate [[Tees Valley Combined Authority]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1400">The [[IARPA]] '''Babel program''' developed [[speech recognition]] technology for noisy telephone conversations. The main goal of the program was to improve the performance of keyword search on languages with very little transcribed data, i.e. low-resource languages. Data from 26 languages was collected with certain languages being held-out as "surprise" languages to test the ability of the teams to rapidly build a system for a new language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Mary|title=Data Resources to Support the Babel Program Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity|url=https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/sites/www.ldc.upenn.edu/files/harper.pdf|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two industry-led teams ([[IBM]] and [[BBN Technologies|BBN]]) and two university-led teams ([[International Computer Science Institute|ICSI]] led by [[Nelson Morgan]] and [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]]) participated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Babel|url=https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/babel|website=IARPA|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the funding from Babel was used to further develop the [[Kaldi (software)|Kaldi]] tookit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Kaldi project|url=http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/history.html|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech data was later made available through the [[Linguistic Data Consortium]].

'''Bacteriophage T5''' is a caudal [[virus]] within the family ''[[Siphoviridae]]''. This [[bacteriophage]] specifically infects ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' bacterial cells and follows a [[Lytic cycle|lytic life cycle]].

== Structure and genome ==
The T5 structure includes a 90 nanometer icosahedral [[capsid]] and a 250 nanometer-long flexible, non-contractile tail. The capsid contains the phage's 121750 base pair, double-stranded DNA genome.&lt;ref&gt;Effantin G. et al. Bacteriophage T5 structure reveals similarities with HK97 and T4 suggesting evolutionary relationships. J Mol Biol. (2006) 361, 993–1002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infection ==
Bacteriophage T5 has been shown to infect ''E. coli'' after its receptor binding protein, pb5, binds to the host cell's outer membrane [[ferrichrome]] transporter, FhuA. The binding triggers structural changes in pb5 and eventually leads to DNA release from the phage capsid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flayhan|first=A|author2=Wien, F|author3= Paternostre, M|author4= Boulanger, P|author5= Breyton, C|title=New insights into pb5, the receptor binding protein of bacteriophage T5, and its interaction with its Escherichia coli receptor FhuA.|journal=Biochimie|date=Sep 2012|volume=94|issue=9|pages=1982–9|pmid=22659573|doi=10.1016/j.biochi.2012.05.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Basit|first=H|author2=Shivaji Sharma, K|author3=Van der Heyden, A|author4=Gondran, C|author5=Breyton, C|author6=Dumy, P|author7=Winnik, FM|author8= Labbé, P|title=Amphipol mediated surface immobilization of FhuA: a platform for label-free detection of the bacteriophage protein pb5.|journal=Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)|date=May 11, 2012|pmid=22576748|doi=10.1039/c2cc31107k|volume=48|pages=6037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bowden development''' is an urban development in the Australian state of [[South Australia]] on a site formerly owned by the [[Clipsal]] corporation in the suburb of [[Bowden, South Australia|Bowden]], within the [[City of Charles Sturt]], in the [[Adelaide|Adelaide metropolitan area]] 2.5 kilometres from the city centre. 

The site covers an area of {{convert|10.25|ha}} and is bounded by Park Terrace to the south, the [[Outer Harbor railway line]] to the west, Drayton Street to the north and Sixth and Seventh Streets to the east. The Government also acquired the adjoining 5.9-hectare site which had been owned by Origin Energy (known as the Brompton Gasworks site). Currently the overall Bowden development site is 16.3 hectares.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/about/progress/&lt;/ref&gt;

The development is expected to be completed by 2020 to 2025. The development is expected to increase the population of Bowden, which was 648 in the 2006 census, to 3,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Census 2006 AUS|id=SSC41161|name=Bowden (State Suburb)|accessdate=2008-06-07| quick=on}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sustainability initiatives==

The Bowden development is leading the way with many groundbreaking initiatives including energy reduction through passive and active measures for buildings. [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] is a world's best practice rating tool from the [[Green Building Council of Australia]] covering a broad range of well-tested sustainability issues.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Developer-Green-Star-Fact-Sheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Each and every building delivered in the development must achieve a minimum 5 Star Green Star rating&lt;ref&gt;http://new.gbca.org.au/showcase/projects/bowden-development/&lt;/ref&gt; including commercial buildings such as '''Plant 4 Bowden'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://new.gbca.org.au/showcase/projects/plant-4-bowden/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Bowden development raised the bar and achieved its 6 Star Green Star - Communities accreditation; and with the highest concentration of Green Star homes in Australia, it is one of the most environmentally sustainable communities in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/new-town-square-opens-bowden-celebrates-sustainability-achievement/&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same year, the Prince's Terraces Adelaide in Bowden became the first residential project to receive 6 Star Green Star design rating from the [[Green Building Council of Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;http://new.gbca.org.au/showcase/projects/princes-terrace-adelaide/&lt;/ref&gt;, encapsulating innovation and world leadership in sustainable design.

==History==
[[File:Bowden clipsal.JPG|thumb|250x250px|The Clipsal factory in Bowden in the foreground]] 
The Bowden site was occupied by Clipsal, a company manufacturing conduit and electrical accessories, in 1936. The opportunity for an urban development on the site grew out of the [[Government of South Australia|South Australian Government]]'s plans for eleven [[transport-oriented development]]s in the Adelaide metropolitan area, combined with Clipsal's decision that the Bowden site is surplus to company requirements and plan to vacate. The site was originally offered for sale in early 2008 with offers to be received by July 2008. Offers in the realm of 75 to 80 million Australian dollars were expected however evidently not attained; as the [[2008 economic crisis]] accelerated and falling property prices diminished the likelihood of a sale at expected prices, the South Australian government intervened and announced in October 2008 that it would purchase the site. It was revealed in November 2008 the government had agreed to pay A$52.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id%3D3956%26print%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206075532/http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=3956 |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==

===2008–2010===

In late 2008, the State Government acquired a 10.25ha parcel of land owned by Gerard Industries (known as the Clipsal site). In early 2010, the government acquired the adjoining 5.9ha site owned by Origin Energy (known as the Brompton Gasworks site).

Both sites are located within the [[City of Charles Sturt]] and are directly adjacent to the Adelaide parklands. The aim is to transform the combined sites into an inner-city, higher intensity, mixed use urban village. The final vision developed collaboratively with the community and stakeholders states: “Bowden Urban Village is a creative and diverse community, living and working in a high density sustainable urban environment. Its character, parklands connections and  integrated urban design will offer a new and distinctive place in Adelaide for residents and visitors.”&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Bowden-Developers-Handbook-Urban-Design-Guidelines-Jan-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Australian Government anticipates that the site will be used to develop more than 2,400 residential apartments and terrace homes, in addition to retail outlets and commercial offices around a town centre.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Bowden-Developers-Handbook-Urban-Design-Guidelines-Jan-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The South Australian Government is promoting the plan as an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independentweekly.com.au/news/local/news/general/housing-for-clipsal-site/1342897.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Bowden is served by [[Bowden railway station]], [[North Adelaide railway station]], buses on Hawker Street and Port Road, and the tram from the nearby [[Adelaide Entertainment Centre]] on Port Road, Hindmarsh.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com.au/maps/@-34.9043904,138.5777874,17z?hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Prince Charles visits Bowden SA.jpg|left|thumb|190x190px|Prince Charles launched the Prince's Terraces in Bowden]]

===2011–2015===

In April 2011, the plans for the development were approved &lt;ref name="approval"&gt;[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/bowden-tod-gets-the-nod/story-e6frea83-1226043678620 Adelaide Now].&lt;/ref&gt; and an information and sales centre opened in March 2012.

Following demolition, site cleanup, surveying, planning and approval, remediation and development are underway. Bowden’s first pedestrian and bicycle-friendly streets — Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and part of Gibson Streets — opened to the public in May 2013.

In 2014, the restaurant '''Jarmer's Kitchen''' opened&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/jarmers-kitchen-bowden/&lt;/ref&gt;, and the Bowden development's first residents moved in&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/first-residents-now-call-bowden-home/&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2015, His Royal Highness Prince [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] officially launched the construction of Australia's first 6 Star [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] residential project, the '''Prince's Terraces Adelaide''' which is predicted to use 50% less energy and 50% less potable water than a typical urban townhouse, with a carbon footprint also reduced by more than 40% when compared to a standard house.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/princes-terrace-adelaide-breaking-ground/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bowden Town Square opening in 2016.jpg|thumb|190x190px|Bowden Town Square opening community celebration]]

===2016-2017===

The community celebrated the completion of a major upgrade to the [[Adelaide Park Lands]] across the road from Bowden in February 2016&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/time-celebrate-bowdens-new-front-yard/&lt;/ref&gt; where the '''Park Terrace Community Garden''' currently resides.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/bowden-life/community-garden/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bowden development achieved its sustainability milestone with a 6 Star [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] - Communities rating in October 2016, and hosted its biggest celebration ever to mark the opening of Bowden Town Square consisting '''Bowden Park''', the '''Plant 4 Bowden''' retail hub and '''Plant 3''' community hub.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/new-town-square-opens-bowden-celebrates-sustainability-achievement/&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2017, 500 new homes were sold.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/bowden-moving-forward-500-homes-sold-new-developers-block/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brilliant Light Power, Inc.''' ('''BLP'''), formerly BlackLight Power, Inc. of [[Cranbury, New Jersey]] is a company founded by Randell L. Mills, who claims to have discovered a new energy source. The purported energy source is based on Mills' assertion that the electron in a hydrogen atom can drop below the lowest energy state known as the [[ground state]]. Mills calls these hypothetical hydrogen atoms that are in an energy state below ground level, "hydrinos".&lt;ref name="parkorigin"/&gt; Mills self-published a closely related book, ''The Grand Unified Theory of Classical Physics'' and has co-authored articles on claimed hydrino-related phenomena.&lt;ref name="GUT-CP"&gt;{{cite web

Critics say it lacks corroborating scientific evidence, and is a relic of [[cold fusion]]. Critical analysis of the claims have been published in the peer reviewed journals ''[[Physics Letters A]]'', ''[[New Journal of Physics]]'', ''[[Journal of Applied Physics]]'', and ''[[Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics]]'' on the basis that Quantum Mechanics is valid, and that the proposed hydrino states are unphysical and incompatible with key equations of Quantum Mechanics.&lt;ref name="dombey"/&gt;

In 2009, ''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'' magazine characterized it as a "loser" technology because "most experts don't believe such lower states exist, and they say the experiments don't present convincing evidence" and mentioned that [[Wolfgang Ketterle]] had said the claims are "nonsense".&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt; BLP has announced several times that it was about to deliver commercial products based on Mill's theories but has not delivered a working product.&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt;

The company, originally called HydroCatalysis Inc.&lt;ref name="parkorigin"/&gt; was founded in 1991 by Randell Mills &lt;ref name=crimson/&gt; who claimed to have discovered a power source that ''"represents a boundless form of new primary energy"'' and that will ''"replace all forms of fuel in the world,"''&lt;ref name="reuters,2009"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 25, 1991 at a press conference in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], Mills first announced his hydrino state hypothesis which rejects the idea that "cold fusion" was occurring in studies surrounding the [[Fleischmann–Pons experiment]]. According to Mills, no fusion was actually happening in the cells, and all the effects would be caused by shrinkage of hydrogen atoms as they fell to a state below the ground state. Experimental evidence offered by Mills was in contradiction to known chemistry and was dismissed by the scientific community.&lt;ref name="parkorigin"&gt;{{cite web |title=What's New Friday, 26 April 1991 Washington, DC |author=Robert L.

=== Collaborators with the company ===

In 1996, NASA released a report describing experiments using a BLP electrolytic cell. Although not recreating the large heat gains reported for the cell by BLP, unexplained power gains ranging from 1.06 to 1.68 of the input power were reported, which, whilst "...admit[ing] the existence of an unusual source of heat with the cell...falls far short of being compelling". The authors went on to propose the recombination of hydrogen and oxygen as a possible explanation of the anomalous results.&lt;ref name="NiedraNasa"&gt;{{cite web

Around 2002, the [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts]] (NIAC) granted a Phase I grant to Anthony Marchese, a mechanical engineer at Rowan University, to study a possible rocket propulsion that would use hydrinos.&lt;ref name="villagevoice.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2002-12-10/news/eureka/|title=Eureka?|author=Erik Baard|date=January 21, 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Rowan University's Anthony Marchese said that whilst "agnostic about the existence of hydrinos", he was quite confident that there was no fraud involved with BLP. Although his NIAC grant was criticised by [[Bob Park]], Marchese said ''"for me to not continue with this study would be unethical to the scientific community. The only reason not to pursue this would be because of being afraid of being bullied."''&lt;ref name="villagevoice.com"/&gt;

Kepplinger said that her "main concern was the proposition that the applicant was claiming the electron going to a lower orbital in a fashion that I knew was contrary to the known laws of physics and chemistry", and that the patent appeared to involve cold fusion and perpetual motion.&lt;ref name="rimmer"/&gt; Kepplinger contacted another Director, Robert Spar, who also expressed doubts on the patentability of the patent application. This caused the USPTO to withdraw from issue the patent application before it was granted and re-open it for review, and to withdraw four related applications, including one for a hydrino power plant.&lt;ref name="baard"/&gt;&lt;!--Baard is only sourcing two withdrawn patents: 1 for IA and 1 for power plant--&gt;

In 2000, a law firm engaged by BLP sent letters to four prominent physicists asking them to stop making what it called "defamatory comments". The physicists had been quoted in the ''[[Village Voice]]'', ''[[Dow Jones Newswire]]'' and other publications as dismissing BLP's claims on the basis that they violated the laws of physics. In response, one of the physicists, Robert L. Park of the [[American Physical Society]], said that if BLP sued, he was confident the scientific community would lend its support and that the court would side with the physicists.&lt;ref name=lawfare2000&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reichhardt T |title=New form of hydrogen power provokes scepticism |journal=Nature | volume=404 |issue=6775 |year=2000 |page=218 |quote=A law firm representing the energy company BlackLight Power, Inc. of Cranbury, New Jersey, sent letters earlier this month to Nobel laureate Philip Anderson of Princeton University, Michio Kaku of the City University of New York, Paul Grant of the non-profit energy agency EPRI and Robert L.

Scientists, Park wrote, are easy to intimidate since they are not rich enough to risk costly legal actions.&lt;ref name="fraud-in-science"/&gt;

In May 2000, BLP filed suit in the [[United States district court|US District Court]] of Columbia, saying that withdrawal of the application after the company had paid the fee was contrary to law. In 2002, the District Court concluded that the USPTO was acting inside the limits of its authority in withdrawing a patent over whose validity it had doubts, and later that year, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] ratified this decision.&lt;ref name="rimmer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="parkpatent"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Peer-reviewed responses ==

In the 2000s, several reviewed articles were published criticizing Hydrino theory for being incompatible with Quantum Mechanics.

For example, in 2005, Andreas Rathke of the [[European Space Agency]], publishing in the ''[[New Journal of Physics]]'', wrote that Mills' description of quantum mechanics is "inconsistent and has several serious deficiencies", and that there is "no theoretical support of the hydrino hypothesis". Rathke said it would be helpful if Mills' experimental results could be independently replicated, and suggested that any evidence produced should be reconsidered in the context of a conventional physical explanation.&lt;ref name=rathke&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rathke A |title=A critical analysis of the hydrino model |journal=New Journal of Physics |doi=10.1088/1367-2630/7/1/127 |year=2005 |volume=7 |issue=127|pages=127 |arxiv=quant-ph/0505150 |bibcode=2005NJPh....7..127R }}&lt;/ref&gt; One inconsistency of Mills' CQM with quantum mechanics regards its inability to be reconciled with the probability density function in quantum mechanics. Rathke stated, "However, while solutions of the Schrödinger equation with n&lt;1 indeed exist, they are not square integrable. This violates not only an axiom of quantum mechanics, but in practical terms prohibits that these solutions can in any way describe the probability density of a particle."&lt;ref name=rathke /&gt; In the same year, the ''[[Journal of Applied Physics]]'' published a critique by A.V. Phelps of the 2004 article, "Water bath calorimetric study of excess heat generation in resonant transfer plasmas" by J. Phillips, R. Mills and X. Chen.&lt;ref name="phelpsCritique"&gt;{{cite journal

Šišović concluded that: "The detected large excessive broadening in pure hydrogen and in Ne–H2 mixture is in agreement with CM [Collision Model] and other experimental results" and that "these results can't be explained by RTM".

In 2006, a paper published in ''[[Physics Letters A]]'', concluded that Mills' theoretical hydrino states are unphysical. For the hydrino states, the [[Binding energy|binding strength]] increases as the strength of the [[electric potential]] decreases, with maximum binding strength when the potential has disappeared completely. The author [[Norman Dombey]] remarked "We could call these anomalous states "[[homeopathic]]" states because the smaller the coupling, the larger the effect." The model also assumes that the [[nuclear charge]] distribution is a point rather than having an arbitrarily small non-zero radius. It also lacks an analogous solution in the [[Schrödinger equation]], which governs non-relativistic systems. Dombey concluded: "We suggest that outside of [[science fiction]] this is sufficient reason to disregard them."&lt;ref name="dombey"&gt;

The abstract of the article is: "It is suggested that [[spectral line]]s, on which the fiction of fractional principal [[quantum number]]s in the hydrogen atom is based, are nothing else but artefacts." Kunze stated that it was impossible to detect the novel lines below 30&amp;nbsp;nm reported by Mills and Ray because the equipment they used did not have the capability to detect them as per the manufacturer and as per "every book on vacuum-UV spectroscopy" and "therefore the observed lines must be artefacts". Kunze also stated that: "The enormous spectral widths of the novel lines point to artefacts, too."&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1656">In [[fluid dynamics]] through [[porous media]], the '''Darcy number''' ('''Da''') represents the relative effect of the permeability of the medium versus its cross-sectional area—commonly the [[hydraulic radius|diameter]] squared.  The number is named after [[Henry Darcy]] and is found from nondimensionalizing the differential form of [[Darcy's Law]].  This number should not be confused with the [[Darcy friction factor]] which applies to [[pressure]] drop in a pipe.  It is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; 
\mathrm{Da} = \frac{K}{d^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where 
* ''K'' is the [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] of the medium ([[SI]] units: {{math|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}); 
* ''d'' is the characteristic length, e.g. the [[diameter]] of the particle (SI units: {{math|m}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0017-9310(02)00109-6 | volume=45 | issue=19 | title=Effects of the Darcy number, the Prandtl number, and the Reynolds number on local thermal non-equilibrium | journal=International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer | pages=3885–3896| year=2002 | last1=Kim | first1=Sung Jin | last2=Jang | first2=Seok Pil }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative forms of this number do exist depending on the approach by which Darcy's Law is made dimensionless and the geometry of the system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thermopedia.com/content/684/&lt;/ref&gt;  The Darcy number is commonly used in [[heat transfer]] through porous media.&lt;ref&gt;http://sharif.ir/~anouri/JP/13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Darwin by Julia Margaret Cameron 2.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Darwin]] in 1868]]

'''Darwinism''' is a [[scientific theory|theory]] of [[Biology|biological]] [[evolution]] developed by the English naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882) and others, stating that all [[species]] of organisms arise and develop through the [[natural selection]] of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and [[reproduction|reproduce]]. Also called '''Darwinian theory''', it originally included the broad concepts of [[transmutation of species]] or of evolution which gained general scientific acceptance after Darwin published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, including concepts which predated Darwin's theories. It subsequently referred to the specific concepts of natural selection, the [[Weismann barrier]], or the [[central dogma of molecular biology]].&lt;ref name="antidarwinian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/anti-darwin.html |title=So You Want to be an Anti-Darwinian: Varieties of Opposition to Darwinism |last=Wilkins |first=John |date=21 December 1998 |website=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the term usually refers strictly to biological evolution, [[creationism|creationists]] have appropriated it to refer to the [[abiogenesis|origin of life]], and it has even been applied to concepts of [[Physical cosmology|cosmic evolution]], both of which have no connection to Darwin's work. It is therefore considered the belief and acceptance of Darwin's and of his predecessors' work—in place of other theories, including [[Teleological argument|divine design]] and [[Panspermia|extraterrestrial origins]].&lt;ref name="EOflunks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://expelledexposed.drupalgardens.com/contest/on-what-evolution-explains |title=…on what evolution explains |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Expelled Exposed |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |location=Oakland, CA |accessdate=2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GalacticDarwinism"&gt;{{cite press release |last1=Le Fèvre |first1=Olivier |last2=Marinoni |first2=Christian |date=6 December 2006 |title=Do Galaxies Follow Darwinian Evolution? |url=https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0645/ |location=Marseille, France |publisher=[[European Southern Observatory]] |id=eso0645 |accessdate=2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] coined the term ''Darwinism'' in April 1860.&lt;ref name="westminster"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huxley |first=T.H. |authorlink=Thomas Henry Huxley |date=April 1860 |title=ART. VIII.—Darwin on the Origin of Species |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=A32&amp;pageseq=29 |journal=[[Westminster Review]] |type=Book review |location=London |publisher=Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy |volume=17 |pages=541–570 |accessdate=2008-06-19 |quote=What if the orbit of Darwinism should be a little too circular?}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used to describe evolutionary concepts in general, including earlier concepts published by English philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]]. Many of the proponents of Darwinism at that time, including Huxley, had reservations about the significance of natural selection, and Darwin himself gave credence to what was later called [[Lamarckism]]. The strict [[neo-Darwinism]] of German evolutionary biologist [[August Weismann]] gained few supporters in the late 19th century. During the approximate period of the 1880s to about 1920, sometimes called "[[the eclipse of Darwinism]]", scientists proposed various [[Alternatives to Darwinism|alternative evolutionary mechanisms]] which eventually proved untenable.  The development of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the early 20th century, incorporating natural selection with [[population genetics]] and [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]], revived Darwinism in an updated form.&lt;ref name="b222"&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=179, 222–225, 338–339, 347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term ''Darwinism'' has remained in use amongst the public when referring to modern evolutionary theory, it has increasingly been argued by science writers such as [[Olivia Judson]] and [[Eugenie Scott]] that it is an inappropriate term for modern evolutionary theory.&lt;ref name="Scott Branch 09"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=Eugenie C. |authorlink1=Eugenie Scott |last2=Branch |first2=Glenn |authorlink2=Glenn Branch |date=16 January 2009 |title=Don't Call it 'Darwinism' |journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |location=New York |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=90–94 |doi=10.1007/s12052-008-0111-2 |issn=1936-6426}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Judson |first=Olivia |authorlink=Olivia Judson |date=15 July 2008 |title=Let's Get Rid of Darwinism |url=http://judson.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/lets-get-rid-of-darwinism/ |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Darwin was unfamiliar with the work of the [[Moravia]]n scientist and [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[friar]] [[Gregor Mendel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sclater|first=Andrew|date=June 2006|title=The extent of Charles Darwin's knowledge of Mendel|journal=[[Journal of Biosciences]]|location=Bangalore, India|publisher=[[Indian Academy of Sciences]] / Springer India|volume=31|issue=2|pages=191–193|doi=10.1007/BF02703910|issn=0250-5991|pmid=16809850}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2009-01-03--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result had only a vague and inaccurate understanding of [[heredity]]. He naturally had no inkling of later theoretical  developments and, like Mendel himself, knew nothing of [[genetic drift]], for example.&lt;ref name="GeneticDrift"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/genetic-drift.html |title=Random Genetic Drift |last=Moran |first=Laurence |date=22 January 1993 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whatis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/darwinism.html |title=What is Darwinism? |last=Hanes |first=Joel |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, creationists often use the term "Darwinism" as a [[pejorative]] term in reference to beliefs such as [[Metaphysical naturalism|scientific materialism]], but in the United Kingdom the term has no negative connotations, being freely used as a shorthand for the body of theory dealing with evolution, and in particular, with evolution by natural selection.&lt;ref name="Scott Branch 09" /&gt;

==Conceptions of Darwinism==
[[File:Editorial cartoon depicting Charles Darwin as an ape (1871).jpg|thumb|As [[evolution]] became widely accepted in the 1870s, [[Caricatures of Charles Darwin and his evolutionary theory in 19th-century England|caricatures of Charles Darwin]] with the body of an ape or monkey symbolised evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=376–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

While the term ''Darwinism'' had been used previously to refer to the work of [[Erasmus Darwin]] in the late 18th century, the term as understood today was introduced when Charles Darwin's 1859 book ''On the Origin of Species'' was reviewed by Thomas Henry Huxley in the April 1860 issue of the ''[[Westminster Review]]''.&lt;ref name="urlThe Huxley File § 4 Darwins Bulldog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/guide4.html |title=Darwin's Bulldog |last1=Blinderman |first1=Charles |last2=Joyce |first2=David |website=The Huxley File |publisher=[[Clark University]] |location=Worcester, MA |accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having hailed the book as "a veritable [[Joseph Whitworth#Whitworth rifle|Whitworth gun]] in the armoury of liberalism" promoting [[naturalism (philosophy)|scientific naturalism]] over [[theology]], and praising the usefulness of Darwin's ideas while expressing professional reservations about Darwin's [[gradualism]] and doubting if it could be proved that natural selection could form new species,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley compared Darwin's achievement to that of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in explaining planetary motion:
{{quotation|What if the orbit of Darwinism should be a little too circular? What if species should offer residual phenomena, here and there, not explicable by natural selection? Twenty years hence naturalists may be in a position to say whether this is, or is not, the case; but in either event they will owe the author of "The Origin of Species" an immense debt of gratitude.... And viewed as a whole, we do not believe that, since the publication of Von Baer's "Researches on Development," thirty years ago, any work has appeared calculated to exert so large an influence, not only on the future of Biology, but in extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated.&lt;ref name="westminster" /&gt;}}

These are the basic tenets of evolution by natural selection as defined by Darwin:

# More individuals are produced each generation that can survive.
# Phenotypic variation exists among individuals and the variation is heritable.
# Those individuals with heritable traits better suited to the environment will survive.
# When reproductive isolation occurs new species will form.

Another important evolutionary theorist of the same period was the Russian geographer and prominent anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] who, in his book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' (1902), advocated a conception of Darwinism counter to that of Huxley. His conception was centred around what he saw as the widespread use of co-operation as a survival mechanism in human societies and animals. He used biological and [[Sociology|sociological]] arguments in an attempt to show that the main factor in facilitating evolution is cooperation between individuals in free-associated societies and groups. This was in order to counteract the conception of fierce [[Competition (biology)|competition]] as the core of evolution, which provided a [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]] for the dominant political, economic and social theories of the time; and the prevalent interpretations of Darwinism, such as those by Huxley, who is targeted as an opponent by Kropotkin. Kropotkin's conception of Darwinism could be summed up by the following quote:

{{quotation|In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sense—not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species, in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits, and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development, are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress. The mutual protection which is obtained in this case, the possibility of attaining old age and of accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development, and the further growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the species, its extension, and its further progressive evolution. The unsociable species, on the contrary, are doomed to decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kropotkin|1902|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Peter Kropotkin|Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1902), Conclusion}}

==19th-century usage==
"Darwinism" soon came to stand for an entire range of evolutionary (and often revolutionary) philosophies about both biology and society. One of the more prominent approaches, summed in the 1864 phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]" by Herbert Spencer, later became emblematic of Darwinism even though Spencer's own understanding of evolution (as expressed in 1857) was more similar to that of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] than to that of Darwin, and predated the [[publication of Darwin's theory]] in 1859. What is now called "[[Social Darwinism]]" was, in its day, synonymous with "Darwinism"—the application of Darwinian principles of "struggle" to society, usually in support of anti-[[philanthropy|philanthropic]] political agenda. Another interpretation, one notably favoured by Darwin's half-cousin [[Francis Galton]], was that "Darwinism" implied that because natural selection was apparently no longer working on "civilized" people, it was possible for "inferior" strains of people (who would normally be filtered out of the [[gene pool]]) to overwhelm the "superior" strains, and voluntary corrective measures would be desirable—the foundation of [[eugenics]].

{{anchor|Darwinismus}}
In Darwin's day there was no rigid definition of the term "Darwinism", and it was used by opponents and proponents of Darwin's biological theory alike to mean whatever they wanted it to in a larger context. The ideas had international influence, and [[Ernst Haeckel]] developed what was known as ''Darwinismus'' in Germany, although, like Spencer's "evolution", Haeckel's "Darwinism" had only a rough resemblance to the theory of Charles Darwin, and was not centered on natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt S. (2009). ''Haeckel: A German Darwinian?'' Comptes Rendus Biologies: 332: 110-118.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] went on a lecture tour across the United States, starting in New York and going via Boston, Washington, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska to California, lecturing on what he called "Darwinism" without any problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Evolution and Wonder: Understanding Charles Darwin |url=http://www.onbeing.org/program/evolution-and-wonder-understanding-charles-darwin/transcript/899#main_content |accessdate=2015-11-16 |series=[[On Being|Speaking of Faith with Krista Tippett]] |first1=Krista (host) |last1=Tippett |authorlink1=Krista Tippett |first2=James |last2=Moore |authorlink2=James Moore (biographer) |network=[[NPR]] |type=Transcript |airdate=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'' (1889), Wallace had used the term ''pure-Darwinism'' which proposed a "greater efficacy" for [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Alfred Russel. (1889). [https://archive.org/stream/darwinismexposit00walluoft#page/n11/mode/2up ''Darwinism: An Exposition of the Theory of Natural Selection, with Some of Its Applications'']. Macmillan and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heilbron, John L. (2003). ''The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science''. OUP USA. p. 203. {{ISBN|978-0195112290}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Romanes]] dubbed this view as "Wallaceism", noting that in contrast to Darwin, this position was advocating a "pure theory of natural selection to the exclusion of any supplementary theory."&lt;ref&gt;Romanes, John George. (1906). [https://archive.org/stream/darwinafterdarwi02romabost#page/12/mode/2up "Darwin and After Darwin: An Exposition of the Darwinian Theory and a Discussion of Post-Darwinian Questions"].

Harvard University Press. p. 274. {{ISBN|978-0674729698}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking influence from Darwin, Romanes was a proponent of both natural selection and the [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]]. The latter was denied by Wallace who was a strict selectionist.&lt;ref&gt;Bolles, R. C; Beecher, M. D. (1987). ''Evolution and Learning''. Psychology Press. p. 45. {{ISBN|978-0898595420}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romanes' definition of Darwinism conformed directly with Darwin's views and was contrasted with Wallace's definition of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Elsdon-Baker, F. (2008). ''Spirited dispute: the secret split between Wallace and Romanes''. Endeavour 32(2): 75-78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The term ''Darwinism'' is often used in the United States by promoters of [[creationism]], notably by leading members of the [[intelligent design movement]], as an epithet to attack evolution as though it were an ideology (an "ism") of [[philosophical naturalism]], or [[atheism]].&lt;ref name="genie"&gt;[[#Petto &amp; Godfrey 2007|Scott 2007]], "Creation Science Lite: 'Intelligent Design' as the New Anti-Evolutionism," p.

Reviewing the film for ''[[Scientific American]]'', [[John Rennie (editor)|John Rennie]] says "The term is a curious throwback, because in modern biology almost no one relies solely on Darwin's original ideas... Yet the choice of terminology isn't random: Ben Stein wants you to stop thinking of evolution as an actual science supported by verifiable facts and logical arguments and to start thinking of it as a dogmatic, atheistic ideology akin to [[Marxism]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rennie |first=John  |authorlink=John Rennie (editor) |date=9 April 2008 |title=Ben Stein's ''Expelled'': No Integrity Displayed |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ben-steins-expelled-review-john-rennie/ |journal=[[Scientific American]] |location=Stuttgart |publisher=[[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group]] |issn=0036-8733 |accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, ''Darwinism'' is also used neutrally within the scientific community to distinguish the modern evolutionary synthesis, sometimes called "neo-Darwinism", from those first proposed by Darwin. ''Darwinism'' also is used neutrally by historians to differentiate his theory from other evolutionary theories current around the same period. For example, ''Darwinism'' may be used to refer to Darwin's proposed mechanism of natural selection, in comparison to more recent mechanisms such as genetic drift and [[gene flow]]. It may also refer specifically to the role of Charles Darwin as opposed to others in the [[history of evolutionary thought]]—particularly contrasting Darwin's results with those of earlier theories such as Lamarckism or later ones such as the modern evolutionary synthesis.

In political discussions in the United States, the term is mostly used by its enemies. "It's a rhetorical device to make evolution seem like a kind of faith, like '[[Maoism]],'" says [[Harvard University]] biologist [[E. O. Wilson]]. He adds, "Scientists don't call it 'Darwinism'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Adler |first=Jerry |date=28 November 2005 |title=Charles Darwin: Evolution of a Scientist |url=http://www.newsweek.com/evolution-scientist-113733 |work=[[Newsweek]] |location=New York |publisher=Newsweek LLC |volume=146 |issue=22 |pages=50–58 |issn=0028-9604 |accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom the term often retains its positive sense as a reference to natural selection, and for example British [[Ethology|ethologist]] and evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] wrote in his collection of essays ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'', published in 2003,  that as a scientist he is a Darwinist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/News/Science-Religion/2003/12/Religion-For-Dummies.aspx |title=Religion: For Dummies |last=Sheahen |first=Laura |website=[[Beliefnet]] |publisher=BN Media, LLC |location=Norfolk, VA |accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1995 book ''[[Darwinian Fairytales]]'', Australian philosopher [[David Stove]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stove|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the term "Darwinism" in a different sense than the above examples. Describing himself as non-religious and as accepting the concept of natural selection as a well-established fact, Stove nonetheless attacked what he described as flawed concepts proposed by some "Ultra-Darwinists." Stove alleged that by using weak or false ''[[ad hoc]]'' reasoning, these Ultra-Darwinists used evolutionary concepts to offer explanations that were not valid (e.g., Stove suggested that [[sociobiology|sociobiological]] explanation of [[altruism]] as an evolutionary feature was presented in such a way that the argument was effectively immune to any criticism). Philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]] wrote a rejoinder to Stove,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blackburn |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Blackburn |date=October 1996 |title=I Rather Think I Am a Darwinian |journal=[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]] |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] on behalf of [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]] |volume=71 |number=278 |pages=605–616 |issn=0031-8191 |jstor=3751128 |doi=10.1017/s0031819100053523}}&lt;/ref&gt; though a subsequent essay by Stove's protegee [[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Franklin |first=James |authorlink=James Franklin (philosopher) |date=January 1997 |title=Stove's Anti-Darwinism |url=http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/stovesantidarwinism.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Philosophy |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press on behalf of Royal Institute of Philosophy |volume=72 |number=279 |pages=133–136 |issn=0031-8191 |jstor=3751309 |doi=10.1017/s0031819100056692}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that Blackburn's response actually "confirms Stove's central thesis that Darwinism can 'explain' anything."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6217">[[Image:Ebic figure.jpg|thumb|right|EBIC experimental schematic]]

'''Electron-beam-induced current''' (EBIC) is a semiconductor analysis technique performed in a [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM) or [[scanning transmission electron microscope]] (STEM). It is used to identify buried junctions or defects in semiconductors, or to examine [[minority carrier]] properties. EBIC is similar to [[cathodoluminescence]] in that it depends on the creation of [[electron–hole pair]]s in the semiconductor sample by the microscope's electron beam. This technique is used in semiconductor [[failure analysis]] and [[solid-state physics]].
[[Image:Ebic image 4.jpg|thumb|right|SEM set up for EBIC]]

==Physics of the technique==
If the semiconductor sample contains an internal [[electric field]], as will be present in the [[depletion region]] at a [[p-n junction]] or [[Schottky diode|Schottky junction]], the electron–hole pairs will be separated by drift due to the electric field.  If the p- and n-sides (or semiconductor and Schottky contact, in the case of a Schottky device) are connected through a [[Ammeter#Picoammeter|picoammeter]], a current will flow.

EBIC is best understood by analogy: in a [[solar cell]], photons of light fall on the entire cell, thus delivering energy  and creating electron hole pairs, and cause a current to flow.  In EBIC, energetic electrons take the role of the photons, causing the EBIC current to flow.  However, because the electron beam of an SEM or STEM is very small, it is scanned across the sample and variations in the induced EBIC are used to map the electronic activity of the sample.

[[Image:Ebic image 3.jpg|thumb|right|Plan-view EBIC showing defects in a diode]]
[[Image:Ebic image 2.jpg|thumb|right|Cross-sectional EBIC of a p-n junction]]

By using the signal from the picoammeter as the imaging signal, an EBIC image is formed on the screen of the SEM or STEM.  When a semiconductor device is imaged in cross-section, the depletion region will show bright EBIC contrast.  The shape of the contrast can be treated mathematically to determine the minority carrier properties of the semiconductor, such as diffusion length and surface recombination velocity.  In plan-view, areas with good crystal quality will show bright contrast, and areas containing defects will show dark EBIC contrast.

As such, EBIC is a semiconductor analysis technique useful for evaluating minority carrier properties and defect populations.

EBIC can be used to probe subsurface hetero-junctions of nanowires and the properties of minority carriers [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl502995q].

EBIC has also been extended to the study of local defects in insulators. For example, W.S. Lau ([[Lau Wai Shing]]) developed "true oxide electron beam induced current" in the 1990s. Thus, besides [[p-n junction]] or [[Schottky diode|Schottky junction]], EBIC can also be applied to [[Metal Oxide Semiconductor|MOS]] diodes. Local defects in [[semiconductor]] and local defects in the insulator could be distinguished. There exists a kind of defect which originates in the [[silicon]] substrate and extends into the insulator on top of the [[silicon]] substrate.  (Please see references below.)

Recently, EBIC has been applied to [[high-k dielectric]] used in advanced [[CMOS]] technology. (Please see references below.)

==Quantitative EBIC==
Most EBIC images are qualitative and only show the EBIC signal as contrast image.  Use of an external scan control generator on the SEM and a dedicated data acquisition system allow for sub-picoamp measurements and can give quantitative results.  Some systems are commercially available that do this, and provide the ability to provide functional imaging by biasing and  applying gate voltages to semiconductor devices.

'''Experimental data''' in [[science]] and engineering is [[data]] produced by a [[measurement]], [[test method]], [[experimental design]] or [[quasi-experimental design]]. In [[clinical research]] any data produced are the result of a clinical trial. Experimental data may be [[qualitative data|qualitative]] or [[Quantitative data|quantitative]], each being appropriate for different [[scientific research|investigations]].

Generally speaking, [[qualitative data]] are considered more [[Observational study|descriptive]] and can be [[Phenomenology (psychology)|subjective]] in comparison to having a continuous measurement scale that produces numbers.  Whereas [[quantitative data]] are gathered in a manner that is normally [[repeatability|experimentally repeatable]], qualitative [[information]] is usually more closely related to phenomenal [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]] and is, therefore, subject to [[Scientific modelling|interpretation]] by individual [[Objectivity (science)|observers]].

Experimental data can be reproduced by a variety of different investigators and [[mathematical analysis]] may be performed on these data.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4540">'''Fusion ignition''' is the point at which a [[nuclear fusion]] reaction becomes [[Nuclear chain reaction|self-sustaining]]. This occurs when the [[energy]] being given off by the [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactions heats the [[Fuel mass fraction|fuel mass]] more rapidly than various loss mechanisms cool it. At this point, the external energy needed to heat the fuel to fusion temperatures is no longer needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chandler|first=David L.|title=New project aims for fusion ignition|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/fusion-ignition-0510.html|work=MIT News|publisher=MIT|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the rate of fusion varies with temperature, the point of ignition for any given machine is typically expressed as a temperature.

Ignition should not be confused with ''[[Fusion energy gain factor|breakeven]]'', a similar concept that compares the total energy being given off to the energy being used to heat the fuel. The key difference is that breakeven ignores losses to the surroundings, which do not contribute to heating the fuel, and thus are not able to make the reaction self-sustaining. Breakeven is an important goal in the [[fusion energy]] field, but ignition is required for a practical energy producing design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Ignition Facility: Ushering in a New Age for Science |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/nif/ |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |accessdate=26 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502212830/https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/nif/ |archivedate=2 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nature, stars reach ignition at temperatures similar to that of the [[Sun]], around 27 million degrees. Stars are so large that the fusion products will almost always interact with the plasma before it can be lost to the environment at the outside of the star. In comparison, man-made reactors are far less dense and much smaller, allowing the fusion products to easily escape the fuel. To offset this, much higher rates of fusion are required, and thus much higher temperatures; most man-made fusion reactors are designed to work at temperatures around 100 million degrees, or higher. To date, no man-made reactor has reached breakeven, let alone ignition. Ignition has however been achieved in the cores of detonating [[thermonuclear weapons]].

==Current research==
{{update|section|date=February 2013}}
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has its 1.8 MJ laser system running at full power.  This laser system is designed to compress and heat a mixture of [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]], which are both isotopes of [[hydrogen]], in order to compress the isotopes to a fraction of their original size, and fuse them into helium atoms (releasing neutrons in the process).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Research Council (U.S.). Plasma Committee|title=Plasma science: advancing knowledge in the national interest|publisher=The National Academic Press|isbn=0-309-16436-2|pages=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQ_CHDJplHkC&amp;pg=PT44&amp;dq=%22fusion+ignition%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22fusion%20ignition%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, [[National Ignition Facility]] Director Mike Dunne predicted in a Photonics West 2012 plenary talk that ignition would be achieved at NIF by October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://optics.org/news/3/1/37&lt;/ref&gt; However, {{as of|2015}}, NIF is operating at conditions about 1/10 to 1/3 of breakeven. Confusingly, by LLNL definitions, ignition and breakeven occur at the same point, due to specifics of their experiment.

Experts believe that achieving fusion ignition is the first step towards the potentially limitless energy source that is nuclear fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Research Council (U.S.).

'''Gaspero Mazzeranghi''' (18th century) was a scientific [[Scientific instrument|instrument maker]].

A smith with a workshop in [[Florence]] in [[Borgo San Jacopo]], Mazzeranghi worked for the [[Museo di Fisica e Storia Naturale]] throughout the last quarter of the eighteenth century, principally as an equipment and tool-maker. He also helped to build mechanical, hydraulic, and electrostatic instruments, and - most important of all - balances.

It is an introduction to the ''why''s of algorithms and data structures.
Features of the book:
#The design factors associated with problems 
#The creative process behind coming up with innovative solutions for [[algorithm]]s and [[data structure]]s
#The line of reasoning behind the constraints, factors and the design choices made.

The very fundamental algorithms portrayed by this book are mostly presented in [[Pseudocode]] and/or [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] notation.

{{Sociology}}

In sociology, '''interactionism''' is a theoretical perspective that derives social processes (such as conflict, cooperation, identity formation) from human interaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/interactionism Interactionism – The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the study of how individuals shape society and are shaped by society through meaning that arises in interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Symbolic Interactionism: Perspective and Method|last=Blumer|first=Herbert|publisher=University of California Press|year=1969|isbn=978-0-520-05676-3|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA|pages=1–6|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactionist theory has grown in the latter half of the twentieth century and has become one of the dominant sociological perspectives in the world today. [[George Herbert Mead]], as an advocate of [[pragmatism]] and the subjectivity of social reality, is considered a leader in the development of interactionism.  [[Herbert Blumer]] expanded on Mead's work and coined the term "symbolic interactionism".

==Subdivisions==
Interactionism has several subdivisions:
[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]],
[[Verstehen]],
[[Social action]],
[[Ethnomethodology]],
[[Symbolic interactionism]], and
[[Social constructionism]].

==Interactions==
Interactionism is [[Microsociology|micro-sociological]] and believes that meaning is produced through the interactions of individuals.

The social interaction is a face-to-face process consisting of actions, reactions, and mutual adaptation between two or more individuals. It also includes animal interaction such as mating. The interaction includes all language (including body language) and mannerisms. The goal of the social interaction is to [[Communication|communicate]] with others. If the interaction is in danger of ending before one intends to it, it can be conserved by conforming to the others' expectations, by ignoring certain incidents or by solving apparent problems.  [[Erving Goffman]] underlines the importance of control in the interaction. One must attempt to control the others' behaviour during the interaction, in order to attain the information one is seeking and in order to control the perception of one's own image. Important concepts in the field of interactionism include the "[[social role]]" and Goffman's "presentation of self."

==Interactionist methodology==
Interactionists are interested in how people see themselves in the broader social context. Interactionists want to understand each individual, and how they act within society. In extreme cases, they would deny [[Social class|class]] as an issue, and would say that we cannot generalize that everyone from one social class thinks in one way. Instead they believe everyone has different attitudes, values, culture and beliefs. Therefore, it is the duty of the sociologist to carry out the study within society. They set out to gather [[qualitative data]].

===Rejection of Structuralist methods===
Interactionists reject statistical ([[numerical data|quantitative]]) data, a method preferred by [[Structuralism|structuralists]]. These methods include; [[experiment]]s, [[structured interview]]s, [[questionnaire]]s, [[non-participant observation]] and [[secondary source]]s.
They have a few basic criticisms, namely:
*Statistical data is not "valid". This is to say that these methods don't provide us with a true picture of society on the topic being researched.
*Research is [[bias]]ed and therefore not objective. Whilst the sociologist would be distant, it is argued that a hypothesis means the research is biased towards a pre-set conclusion ([[Rosenhan experiment]] in 1973). This is again rejected by Interactionists, who claim it is [[Social artifact|artificial]], and also raises ethical issues to experiment on people.

===Preferred Interactionist Methods===
Interactionists prefer several methods to contrast with Structuralist methods, namely; [[unstructured interview]]s, [[covert participant observation]], overt [[participant observation]], and analysing historical, public and personal documents by [[content analysis]].

Interactionist methods generally reject the absolute need to provide statistics. Statistics allows [[Causality|cause and effect]] to be shown {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}, as well as isolating variables so that relationships and trends can be distinguished over time.
Instead, interactionists want to "go deep" to explain society. This draws criticisms such as:
*Information and sociological research cannot be compared or contrasted, hence we can never truly understand how society changes. Data are not [[Reliable data|reliable]].
*The information that is gathered is interpreted (hence the name "Interpretivist") by a sociologist, therefore it isn't objective, but biased.

Despite these criticisms, interactionist methods do allow flexibility. The fact that there is no hypothesis means that the sociologist is not rooted in attempting to prove dogma or theory. Instead, researchers react to what they discover, not assuming anything about society. (This is not entirely true. There can be hypotheses for many studies using interactionist methods. The researcher may then be inclined to observe certain events happening while ignoring the bigger picture. This will still bias the results, if such studies are not well conducted. This is arguably why some theorists have turned to this method. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}
It also shows how human behaviour is affected and altered through interactions i.e. socialization.)

===Case studies===
*'''[[Field experiment]]s:''' [[David Rosenhan]] 1973. [[Rosenhan experiment|Studied]] the treatment of mental health in California and got 8 normal researchers to carry out the study at 12 hospitals. Critics say the method is unethical, and the vast majority of Interactionists concur.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}
*'''[[Unstructured interview]]s:''' [[William Labov]] 1973. Study of [[Sociolinguistics|socio-linguistics]]. [[Joan Smith (psychologist)|Joan Smith]] 1998. [[Aaron Cicourel]] and [[John Kitsuse]] 1963 ethno-methodology study in American schools. [[Howard S. Becker|Howard Becker]] 1971.
*'''[[Participant observation]]:''' [[John Howard Griffin]], [[Michael Haralambos]].

==Interactionist links to other theories==
Interactionism, or the idea that individuals have more awareness, skill and power to change their own situation, links to several other theories.

===Neo-Marxists===
{{main|Neo-Marxism}}'''Neo-Marxism''' is a loose term for various twentieth-century approaches that amend or extend [[Marxism]] and [[Marxist theory]], usually by incorporating elements from other intellectual traditions, such as [[critical theory]], [[psychoanalysis]], or [[existentialism]].{{emptysection|date=December 2013}}

===Pluralism===
[[Pluralism (political theory)|Pluralism]] is the idea that the "public gets what the public wants." It is the notion that our lives offer choice like a [[representative democracy]]. This idea of [[Choice#Choice and evaluability in economics|consumer choice]] means that each individual has power as a consumer to change any aspect of life if he/she wishes to do so. The situation that exists is, according to the theory, a reflection of the norms, values and beliefs of the majority of people. It fits with the idea of individual power, although interactionist sociologists may not accept the idea that we are all labeled as "consumers".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11772">A '''lean [[laboratory]]''' is one which is focused on processes, procedures, and infrastructure that deliver results in the most efficient way in terms of cost, speed, or both. Lean laboratory is a management and organization process derived from the concept of [[lean manufacturing]] and the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS).&lt;ref name="SmartLean13"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2hEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160 |chapter=Chapter 5: Developing a lean approach to biopharmaceutical processes |title=Lean Biomanufacturing |author=Smart, N.J. |publisher=Elsevier |pages=147–98 |year=2013 |isbn=9781908818409}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McPhersonHenry11"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-97J-8Zh2hkC&amp;pg=PA6 |title=Henry's Clinical Diagnosis and Management by Laboratory Methods |editor=McPherson, R.A.; Pincus, M.R. |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |page=6 |year=2011 |isbn=9781455726844}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of a lean laboratory is to reduce resource usage and costs while improving productivity, staff morale, and laboratory-driven outcomes.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McPhersonHenry11" /&gt;

==Overview==
Manufacturing companies, including medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers, operate in highly regulated environments&lt;ref name="TreleaseAdvising09"&gt;{{cite book |title=Advising High-Technology Companies |author=Trelease, N.T. |publisher=Practising Law Institute |year=2009 |isbn=9781402403965}}&lt;/ref&gt; which often necessitate a great deal of resources, time, and money being expended in the testing, release, and [[quality assurance]] of their products. Since the early 1990s, there has been a more widespread drive to adopt more lean approaches both in the [[Lean manufacturing|manufacturing]] and testing of products.&lt;ref name="HolwegTheGen07"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The genealogy of lean production |journal=Journal of Operations Management |last=Holweg |first=Matthias |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=420–437 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.jom.2006.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advances in lean thinking developed and refined in the automotive industry initially by Toyota (TPS)&lt;ref name="SmartLean13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McPhersonHenry11" /&gt; are now being used as best practices across most manufacturing sectors.&lt;ref name="HobbsHist03"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJa0rwBt74wC&amp;pg=PA13 |chapter=Chapter 1: History and Modern Applications of Lean Manufacturing |title=Lean Manufacturing Implementation: A Complete Execution Manual for Any Size Manufacturer |author=Hobbs. D.P. |publisher=J. Ross Publishing |pages=13–46 |year=2003 |isbn=9781932159141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of lean laboratory shares its origins with lean manufacturing and uses the same tools to deliver the most efficient and least wasteful processes, tools such as [[Kaizen]], [[Just in time (business)|Just In Time]] (JIT), [[Heijunka]], [[Kanban]], and [[Six Sigma]].&lt;ref name="SmartLean13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HobbsHist03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PyzdekTheSix14"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Six Sigma Handbook |author=Pyzdek, T.; Keller, P.A. |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |pages=704 |year=2014 |isbn=9780071840538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principles of lean manufacturing have been difficult at times to migrate to laboratories because they are quite different from manufacturing environments. In the hospital laboratory, for example, difficulties arise with the "staunch adherence to traditional laboratory practices, complexity of workflow, and marked variability in sample numbers."&lt;ref name="DundasALean11"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Lean Laboratory: Operational Simplicity and Cost Effectiveness of the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel |journal=The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics |author=Dundas, N.E.; Siadie, M.S.; Revell, P.A. et al. |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=175–9 |year=2011 |doi=10.1016/j.jmoldx.2010.09.003 |pmid=21354052 |pmc=3128566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical labs, "the limiting belief" that procedures are so different that lean won't work often slow down adoption.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2hEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA237 |chapter=Chapter 7: Integration of biomanufacturing with lean laboratory operations |title=Lean Biomanufacturing |author=Smart, N.J. |publisher=Elsevier |pages=221–72 |year=2013 |isbn=9781908818409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to manufacturing environments, most analytical and microbiological laboratories have a relatively low volume of samples but a high degree of variability and complexity. Many standard lean tools are not a good fit; however, lean can still be applied to these types of labs.&lt;ref name="ZidelALean06"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Lean Guide to Transforming Healthcare: How to Implement Lean Principles in Hospitals, Medical Offices, Clinics, and Other Healthcare Organizations |author=Zidel, T. |publisher=ASQ Quality Press |pages=192 |year=2006 |isbn=9780873897013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A generic approach is not suitable for laboratories, but careful adaptation of the techniques based on a thorough understanding of lab operations will deliver significant benefits in terms of cost, speed, or both.

==Conventional laboratories==
It is a common occurrence for testing laboratories to suffer from long and variable [[lead time]]s. Some of the problems or issues which can be attributed to conventional or “non lean” laboratories include the following issues.

===Lack of focus===
Analysts and microbiologists are typically focused on test accuracy and individual test run efficiency. Very often, personnel are dedicated to specific tests and there is little or no control of the progress of individual samples through a sometimes highly variable test routing that can be dependent on product type and/or the intended market.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;

===Long and variable lead times===
In many test laboratories, it is normal to find queues in front of each test where individual samples wait until enough similar samples arrive to constitute an "efficient test run." This approach causes long and variable lead times and, contrary to popular belief, does not result in higher [[productivity]].&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;

===Ineffective "fast track" systems===
To deal with the long lead times, "fast track" systems are often developed in an effort to deal with urgent samples but these often become unworkable. Frequently, the proportion of samples designated as priority becomes so large that fast tracking quickly becomes ineffective.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;

===High levels of work in progress===
Laboratories often maintain high levels of [[work in process]] (WIP), which inevitably results in significant (non value adding) effort being expended in controlling, tracking, and prioritizing samples and in planning analyst work. Companies often respond to this situation by investing in a [[laboratory information management system]] (LIMS) or some other IT system. However these systems do not in themselves improve performance. The underlying process by which work is organized and moves through the lab must first be re-engineered based on lean principles.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SmartLean13" /&gt;

===Volatile incoming workload===
For many testing laboratories, the incoming workload is inherently volatile, with significant peaks and dips. This causes low productivity (during dips) and/or poor lead time performance (during peaks). Very often the capacity of the lab is not well understood, and there is no mechanism to level or smooth the workload.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;

==Implementing lean in the lab==
To address the above problems and issues, a lean laboratory uses lean principles to eliminate waste or [[Muda (Japanese term)|Muda]]. There are a number of principles that can be used, but the goal is always primarily focused on improving measurable performance and/or reducing costs.

===Specify value===
The first step in designing any lean laboratory is to specify value. Every activity in the laboratory is identified and categorizing as "value added," "non-value added" (from the customers perspective), and "incidental." Incidental work is non value add in itself but essential to enable value add tasks to be carried out. A significant focus of any lean lab initiative will be to eliminate or reduce the non value add activities.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;

===Identify the value stream===
Another key lean step is to develop value stream maps of the overall release process. This should avoid the error of working on point solutions that only end up moving a bottleneck to another process and therefore do not deliver overall improvements. For example, there is no real value in reducing analytical laboratory lead times below the time of a release constraint test in a microbiology lab. You can however use increased velocity to help "level the load" or to maximize individual test run efficiency.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TappingValue02"&gt;{{cite book |title=Value Stream Management: Eight Steps to Planning, Mapping, and Sustaining Lean Improvements |author=Tapping, D.; Luyster, T.; Shuker, T. |publisher=Productivity Press |pages=176 |year=2002 |isbn=9781563272455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Make value flow and create pull===
A lean laboratory will normally have a defined sequence of tests and associated analyst roles that make good use of people and equipment. A key principle is to flow work through the laboratory so that once testing begins on a sample, it is kept moving and not allowed to queue between tests. This creates a focus and drive to reduce throughput time, which can be converted into a lead-time reduction or used to allow samples to wait in an incoming queue to facilitate level loading and /or grouping for efficiency.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;

"Pull" is interpreted as testing according to customer priority. If this is not inherent in the order in which samples arrive, then the samples are taken from an incoming queue according to customer demand and thereafter processed in [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] order with no overtaking.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;

===Level the load and the mix===
At its simplest, leveling the load (overall workload) and the mix (the mix of sample types) is about putting the same amount of work into the lab on a daily basis. This is probably the most critical step and potentially the most beneficial for the majority of testing laboratories. Successfully leveling a volatile load and mix will significantly improve productivity and/or lead time. The productivity improvement can be used to provide additional capacity or converted into a cost reduction.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;

===Eliminate waste (muda)===
Lean laboratories continuously look to develop solutions and re-engineer processes to eliminate or reduce the non-value added and incidental tasks identified when specifying value.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;

===Manage performance===
An essential part of lean in the laboratory is to manage and review a lab's performance daily, ensuring that [[Key Performance Indicator]]s (KPI's) are good and that the overall laboratory process is in control.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;

== International Awards ==

The series has won more than 20 awards in international film festivals. In particular, wildlife episodes have been acclaimed for their cinematography, sound and storylines.
With their 5.1 surround sound and dramatic structures, the stand-alone episodes of "Life on Fire" contrast with those from other wildlife TV series, which are usually delivered in stereo and structured like catalogues - with a succession of sequences guided by a seasonal or geographical theme ("Spring", "Abyss", etc...).

As well as listing the countries, it also shows the number of registered clubs playing in each country, official referees and the number of registered players broken down by gender and age group. 

Latest information supplier by World Rugby (the new name for the IRB) In 2016, the total number of registered players increased from 2.82 million to 3.2 million while the total number of non-registered rugby players rose from 4.91 million to 5.3 million. South Africa has the most registered players with 651,146 and England the most players overall with 2,139,604. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldrugby.org/development/player-numbers?lang=en|website=Worldrugby.org|accessdate=10 March 2017|title=Player numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PinpointBPS methodology is centered on the following process of discovery that highlights current performance, expected future performance and the means to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pinpointbps.com/news/2016/3/10/pinpointbps-movement-continuous-improvement|title=Inside the PinpointBPS® Movement: Innovating Towards Certainty in Laboratories|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology has also been aligned with [[ISO 15189]] requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pinpointbps.com/news/2016/4/28/iso15189-guidelines|title=Taking care of ISO 15189 compliance with PinpointBPS®|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The PinpointBPS Methodology ===
The steps below provide a high-level overview of the methodology in practice.

==== 1. Focus on quantified value ====
While all effort within the laboratory is put into value creation, from [[turnaround time]] improvements to quality output and cost savings / profit increases, it is important that the performance of each of these can be quantified and their relationship with the financial performance of the laboratory understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darkdaily.com/creating-added-value-from-clinical-pathology-laboratory-testing-produced-improved-outcomes-at-university-of-mississippi-medical-center-and-broward-health622|title=Creating Added Value from Clinical Pathology Laboratory Testing Produced Improved Outcomes at University of Mississippi Medical Center and Broward Health {{!}} Dark Daily|website=www.darkdaily.com|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enables the laboratory to understand current performance needs while at the same time establishing the [[Performance indicator|key performance indicators]] that are important and should be measured.

==== 2. Determine current performance ====
Understanding the current performance of the laboratory provides the necessary context to highlight performance improvement requirements as well as areas of excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dana|first=Travnickova|date=2009|title=Processes assessment and monitoring in a clinical laboratory|url=http://qip-journal.eu/files/2009/2009-1/QIP_1-2009_Travnickova.pdf|journal=Quality Innovation Prosperity|volume=8|issue=1|access-date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This should be conducted by looking at sample turnaround time and resource utilization, and should be considered on a holistic basis, creating a virtual model of the whole laboratory by mapping out all processes and activities in detail. This provides an end-to-end perspective on current performance and forms the basis for future performance improvement initiatives.

==== 3. Understand future performance ====
The expectation for future performance should be done through [[business process modeling]], with current performance as the foundation. Using LIS data as well as data from workforce scheduling, and combining this data with the process model of the laboratory, creates an environment where changes to the laboratory can be [[Simulation|simulated]] and the impact to performance understood in quantifiable terms. It is important to validate both the integrity of the [[data]] and the accuracy of the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ezzelle|first=J.|last2=Rodriguez-Chavez|first2=I. R.|last3=Darden|first3=J. M.|last4=Stirewalt|first4=M.|last5=Kunwar|first5=N.|last6=Hitchcock|first6=R.|last7=Walter|first7=T.|last8=D’Souza|first8=M. P.|date=2008-01-07|title=Guidelines on Good Clinical Laboratory Practice|journal=Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis|volume=46|issue=1|pages=18–29|doi=10.1016/j.jpba.2007.10.010|issn=0731-7085|pmc=2213906|pmid=18037599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a desirable outcome for future performance has been found, the difference (or delta) in performance is evaluated to understand future performance requirements.

==== 4. Establish performance delta and requirements ====
The difference in performance between current ([[Baseline (budgeting)|baseline]]) and future (expected) performance highlights the necessary process changes and related initiatives that are required to achieve the future performance. This impact should be measured according to finance ([[cost]] or [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]), quality and turnaround time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawkins|first=Robert C|date=2007-11-01|title=Laboratory Turnaround Time|journal=The Clinical Biochemist Reviews|volume=28|issue=4|pages=179–194|issn=0159-8090|pmc=2282400|pmid=18392122}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these changes to take effect, each change initiative is prioritized based on a quantified understanding of its impact to the laboratory 'bottom line', while also improving turnaround time, quality or both.

=== Comparison with Lean ===
While the PinpointBPS methodology can support [[Lean manufacturing|Lean]] (and other [[Continual improvement process|continuous improvement]] methodologies like [[Six Sigma]]) in that it ultimately aims to provide patients and other stakeholders with quality outputs, its approach differs from other methodologies like the [[Lean laboratory|Lean Laboratory]] in various ways:
* While lean focuses on waste and the elimination thereof,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://businesscasestudies.co.uk/nestle/achieving-sustainability-through-lean-production/eliminating-waste.html|title=Eliminating waste - Achieving sustainability through lean production - Nestlé {{!}} Nestlé case studies, videos, social media and information {{!}} Business Case Studies|website=businesscasestudies.co.uk|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; PinpointBPS focuses on understanding process and the impact of changes to processes on value while reducing risk.
* The definition of success differs in its layers of ambiguity. The focus of lean is to achieve "the happy situation of perfect value provided with zero waste",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Improving Health Management through Clinical Decision Support Systems|last=Moon|first=Jane D.|publisher=IGI Global|year=2016|isbn=9781466694323|location=Australia|pages=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; while PinpointBPS aims to establish a quantified definition of future value — "facts and figures, no fluff".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Lean has evolved from the manufacturing approach first designed by [[Toyota]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/History.cfm|title=A Brief History of Lean|website=www.lean.org|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; while PinpointBPS has been specifically developed for use in [[pathology]] performance improvement.
* Lean allows for the focus and treatment of individual or isolated performance issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCulloch|first=Peter|last2=Kreckler|first2=Simon|last3=New|first3=Steve|last4=Sheena|first4=Yezen|last5=Handa|first5=Ashok|last6=Catchpole|first6=Ken|date=2010-01-01|title=Effect of a "Lean" intervention to improve safety processes and outcomes on a surgical emergency unit|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|volume=341|pages=c5469|issn=1756-1833|pmid=21045024|doi=10.1136/bmj.c5469}}&lt;/ref&gt; while PinpointBPS motivates for a system-wide approach first by creating visibility and testing.
* Prioritization in Lean is done according customer priority or on a [[FIFO and LIFO accounting|FIFO]] (first in, first out) basis, while PinpointBPS encourages prioritization according to expected, quantified output linked to cost reduction or profit generation.

== PinpointBPS in Practice ==
PinpointPBS has been based on eight practical principles that allow laboratories to take ownership of the methodology and performance improvement initiatives.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== The 8 Principles ===

==== 1. Boost the bottom-line, or bust ====
As with any organization, value creation is the ultimate goal, however purely focusing on quality output may neglect cognizance of financial value. Understanding the ultimate financial impact of any value creating activity is critical for ongoing [[sustainability]].

==== 2. Led by a common language ====
Ensuring that everyone in the [[organization]] (and [[value chain]]) has the same understanding of value creation and how it links to financial performance

Continuous innovation requires us to draw from the same knowledge and speak the same language. We establish a [[Universal Truths and Cycles|universal truth]] that enables us to work together seamlessly.

==== 3. Trust the transparency ====
We value a clear line of sight into our strengths, our weaknesses and the connections between every process, person, and piece of technology.

==== 4. Facts and figures, no fluff ====
We believe in making decisions based on evidence. In our quest for bottom-line impact, every business action must be supported by real, tangible proof.

==== 5. Driven by decisiveness ====
We are empowered through understanding our performance and what shapes it. This allows everyone in our organization to make decisions swiftly, with understanding and certainty.

==== 6. Inaccuracy is inexcusable ====
Close is not close enough. Every decision we take is based on fact, and our execution must be accomplished with the same precision

==== 7. Big impact beats small ====
We believe in following the big opportunities that significantly impact the bottom line, rather than wasting time and resources on those that do not.

==== 8. Knowledge knows no bounds ====
We are only as good as the collective we represent. We fundamentally believe in continually imparting [[knowledge]] and learning from each other to move the industry forward.

== Tools ==
Various tools have been developed to enable the methodology in laboratories, including performance overviews, standardized process mapping using [[Business Process Model and Notation|BPMN]] (business process model and notation), as well as simulation and [[Scenario planning|scenario modeling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pinpointbps.com/solutions|title=Solutions|website=PinpointBPS® Movement {{!}} Optimizing laboratory performance using the 8 Principles of Certainty|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional certification ==
PinpointBPS professional [[certification]] can be granted to both laboratories that practice the methodology, as well as people who have successfully completed further study of the methodology. Two levels of PinpointBPS professional certifications exist. These certifications have been [[Accreditation|accredited]] by [http://www.ascls.org/p-a-c-e PACE], [https://cpduk.co.uk/ CPD], and the [https://www.rcpath.org/ Royal College of Pathologists].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ltsconsulting.com/learning|title=LTS Learning - Training courses for diagnostics laboratories|website=LTS Holdings|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Champion ===
A PinpointBPS Champion is a professional who is able to interpret laboratory performance improvement metrics, map out all processes within a laboratory and make improvement recommendations.

=== Master ===
A PinpointBPS Master builds on the PinpointBPS Champion certification and is a professional who is able to simulate changes to a laboratory and interpret performance outputs, to make performance improvement recommendations and manage initiatives from start to end.

However, three relatively unknown names for the genus had been published earlier ''Virgularia'' Ruiz &amp; Pav. in 1794, ''Chytra'' C.F.Gaertn. in 1807, and ''Tomanthera'' Raf. in 1837, of which ''Virgularia'' would have priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D'Arcy, W.G. |year=1979 |title=(463) Proposal to Conserve the Name ''Agalinis'' Raf.

'''Priority''' is a fundamental principle of modern [[botanical nomenclature]] and [[zoological nomenclature]]. Essentially, it is the principle of recognising the first valid application of a name to a plant or animal. There are two aspects to this: 
# The first formal scientific name given to a plant or animal [[taxon]] shall be the name that is to be used, called the [[Valid name (zoology)|valid name]] in zoology and [[Correct name (botany)|correct name]] in botany.
# Once a name has been used, no subsequent publication of that name for another taxon shall be valid (zoology) or [[validly published name (botany)|validly published]] (botany).

There are formal provisions for making exceptions to this principle. If an archaic or obscure prior name is discovered for an established taxon, the current name can be declared a ''[[nomen conservandum]]'' (botany) or ''[[conserved name]]'' (zoology), and so conserved against the prior name. Similarly, if the current name for a taxon is found to have an archaic or obscure prior [[homonym (botany)|homonym]], the current name can be declared a ''[[nomen protectum]]'' (zoology) or the older name suppressed (''[[nomen rejiciendum]]'', botany).

==History==
The principle of priority has not always been in place. When [[Carl Linnaeus]] laid the foundations of modern nomenclature, he offered no recognition of prior names. The botanists who followed him were just as willing to overturn Linnaeus's names. The first sign of recognition of priority came in 1813, when [[A. P. de Candolle]] laid out some principles of good nomenclatural practice. He favoured retaining prior names, but left wide scope for overturning poor prior names.&lt;ref name=Nicolson/&gt;

===In botany===
During the 19th century, the principle gradually came to be accepted by almost all botanists, but debate continued to rage over the conditions under which the principle might be ignored. Botanists on one side of the debate argued that priority should be universal and without exception. This would have meant a one-off major disruption as countless names in current usage were overturned in favour of archaic prior names. In 1891, [[Otto Kuntze]], one of the most vocal proponents of this position, did just that, publishing over 30000 new combinations in his ''[[Revisio Generum Plantarum]]''.&lt;ref name=Nicolson&gt;{{cite journal | first = Dan | last = Nicolson | year = 1991 | title = A history of botanical nomenclature | journal = [[Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden]] | volume = 78 | pages = 33–56 | doi = 10.2307/2399589}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then followed with further such publications in 1893, 1898 and 1903.&lt;ref name=Nicolson/&gt; His efforts, however, were so disruptive that they appear to have benefited his opponents. By the 1900s, the need for a mechanism for the conservation of names was widely accepted, and details of such a mechanism were under discussion. The current system of "modified priority" was essentially put in place at the [[Cambridge Congress of 1930]].&lt;ref name=Nicolson/&gt;

==In zoology==
The Principle of Priority is one of the guiding principles of the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'', defined by Article 23. There are exceptions: another name may be given precedence by any provision of the Code or by any ruling of the Commission. It is a fundamental guiding precept that preserves the stability of biological nomenclature. It was first formulated in 1842 by  a committee appointed by the [[British Association]] to consider the rules of zoological nomenclature; the committee's report was written by [[Hugh Edwin Strickland]].

==Examples==
* In 1855, [[John Edward Gray]] published the name ''Antilocapra anteflexa'' for a new species of [[pronghorn]], based on a pair of horns. However, it is now thought that his specimen belonged to an unusual individual of an existing species, ''[[Antilocapra americana]]'', with a name published by [[George Ord]] in 1815. The older name, by Ord, takes priority; with ''Antilocapra anteflexa'' becoming a junior [[synonym (zoology)|synonym]].
* In 1856, [[Johann Jakob Kaup]] published the name ''Leptocephalus brevirostris'' for a new species of [[eel]]. However, it was realized in 1893 that the organism described by Kaup was in fact the juvenile form of the [[European eel]] (see [[eel life history]] for the full story). The European eel was named ''Muraena anguilla'' by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758. So ''Muraena anguilla'' is the name to be used for the species, and ''Leptocephalus brevirostris'' must be considered as a junior synonym and not be used. Today the European eel is classified in the genus ''[[Anguilla (genus)|Anguilla]]'' (Garsault, 1764,) so its currently used name is ''Anguilla anguilla'' (Linnaeus, 1758).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3202">{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Thermodynamic system|Systems]]}}
In [[thermodynamics]], a '''quasi-static process''' is a [[thermodynamic process]] that happens slowly enough for the system to remain in internal [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. An example of this is quasi-static compression, where the [[volume]] of a system changes at a slow rate enough to allow the [[pressure]] to remain uniform and constant throughout the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to Thermal Physics|last = Schroeder|first = Daniel|publisher = Addison Wesley Longman|year = 2000|isbn = 0-201-38027-7|location = United States|pages = 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]] is necessarily a quasi-static one. However, quasi-static processes involving entropy production are irreversible. An example of a quasi-static process that is not reversible is a compression against a system with a piston subject to friction&amp;mdash;although the system is always in thermal equilibrium, the friction ensures the generation of dissipative entropy, which directly goes against the definition of reversible. A notable example of a process that is not even quasi-static is the slow [[heat transfer|heat exchange]] between two bodies at two finitely different temperatures, where the heat exchange rate is controlled by an approximately [[adiabatic]] partition between the two bodies&amp;mdash;in this case, no matter how slowly the process takes place, the states of the two bodies are never infinitesimally close to equilibrium{{clarify|reason="being close to equilibrium is not part of the definition"|date=February 2015}}, since thermal equilibrium requires that the two bodies be at the same temperature.

Some ambiguity exists in the literature concerning the distinction between quasi-static and reversible processes, as these are sometimes taken as synonyms. The reason is the theorem that any reversible process is also a quasi-static one, even though (as we have illustrated above) the converse is not true. In practical situations, it is essential to differentiate between the two: any engineer would remember to include friction when calculating the dissipative entropy generation, so there are no reversible processes in practice. The definition given above is closer to the intuitive understanding of the word &amp;ldquo;quasi-&amp;rdquo; (almost) &amp;ldquo;static&amp;rdquo;, and remains technically different from reversible processes.

==PV-Work in various quasi-static processes==

# Constant pressure: [[Isobaric process]]es,
#: &lt;math&gt;W_{1-2} = \int P dV = P(V_2 - V_1)&lt;/math&gt;
# Constant volume: [[Isochoric process]]es,
#: &lt;math&gt;W_{1-2} = \int P dV = 0&lt;/math&gt;
# Constant temperature: [[Isothermal process]]es,
#: &lt;math&gt;W_{1-2} = \int P dV,&lt;/math&gt; where ''P'' varies with ''V'' via &lt;math&gt;\quad PV = P_1 V_1 = C&lt;/math&gt;, so
#: &lt;math&gt;W_{1-2} = P_1 V_1 \ln \frac{V_2}{V_1}&lt;/math&gt;
# [[Polytropic process]]es,
#: &lt;math&gt;W_{1-2} = \frac{P_1 V_1 - P_2 V_2}{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

==Overview==
The Ross–Fahroo methods are based on shifted Gaussian pseudospectral node points.  The shifts are obtained by means of a linear or nonlinear transformation while the Gaussian pseudospectral points are chosen from a collection of [[Gaussian quadrature|Gauss-Lobatto]] or [[Gaussian quadrature|Gauss-Radau]] distribution arising from [[Legendre polynomials|Legendre]] or [[Chebyshev polynomials]].  The Gauss-Lobatto pseudospectral points are used for finite-horizon [[optimal control]] problems while the Gauss-Radau pseudospectral points are used for infinite-horizon optimal control problems.&lt;ref name="RK"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = I.

==Mathematical applications==
The Ross–Fahroo methods are founded on the [[Ross–Fahroo lemma]]; they can be applied to optimal control problems governed by [[differential equation]]s, [[differential algebraic equation|differential-algebraic equations]], [[differential inclusion]]s, and differentially-flat systems. They can also be applied to infinite-horizon optimal control problems by a simple domain transformation technique.&lt;ref name="FR1"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="FR2"/&gt;  The Ross–Fahroo pseudospectral methods also form the foundations for the [[Bellman pseudospectral method]].

==Flight applications and awards==
The Ross–Fahroo methods have been implemented in many practical applications and laboratories around the world. In 2006, NASA used the Ross–Fahroo method to implement the "zero propellant maneuver" on board the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref name="zpmIEEE"&gt;N. S. Bedrossian, S. Bhatt, W. Kang, and I. M. Ross, Zero-Propellant Maneuver Guidance, IEEE Control Systems Magazine, October 2009 (Feature Article), pp 53–73.&lt;/ref&gt;
In recognition of all these advances, the AIAA presented Ross and Fahroo, the 2010 Mechanics and Control of Flight Award, for "... changing the landscape of flight mechanics." Ross was also elected AAS Fellow for "his pioneering contributions to pseudospectral optimal control."

==Distinctive features==
A remarkable feature of the Ross–Fahroo methods is that it does away with the prior notions of "direct" and "indirect" methods. That is, through a collection of theorems put forth by Ross and Fahroo,&lt;ref name = "RF01" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "RF1" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "RF3" /&gt;
&lt;ref name = "FR00"&gt;
F. Fahroo and I. M. Ross, Trajectory Optimization by Indirect Spectral Collocation Methods, Proceedings of the AIAA/AAS Astrodynamics Conference, August 2000, Denver, CO. AIAA Paper 2000–4028&lt;/ref&gt;
they showed that it was possible to design pseudospectral methods for optimal control that were equivalent in both the direct and indirect forms. This implied that one could use their methods as simply as a "direct" method while automatically generating accurate duals as in "indirect" methods. This revolutionized solving optimal control problems leading to widespread use of the Ross–Fahroo techniques.&lt;ref name="Gong1"&gt;Q. Gong, W. Kang, N. Bedrossian, F. Fahroo, P. Sekhavat and K. Bollino, Pseudospectral Optimal Control for Military and Industrial Applications, 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, New Orleans, LA, pp. 4128–4142, Dec. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software implementation==
The Ross–Fahroo methods are implemented in the MATLAB optimal control solver, [[DIDO (software)|DIDO]].

'''Rufus Henry Gilbert''' (1832–1885) was an [[United States|American]] [[surgeon]] and inventor, who worked on [[rapid transit]] in [[New York City]].

==Biography==

===Early years===

Rufus Henry Gilbert was born in [[Guilford, New York]] on January 26, 1832. Gilbert was the son of [[William Dwight Gilbert]], a county judge in [[Steuben County, New York]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/07/11/103630366.pdf "Death of Rufus H. Gilbert: He Breathes His Last Unattended by Relatives or Friends,"] ''New York Times,'' July 11, 1885.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical career===

Gilbert studied at the [[New York College of Physicians and Surgeons]] and graduated to become a physician and surgeon.&lt;ref name=Middleton&gt;[[William D. Middleton]], ''Metropolitan Railways: Rapid Transit in America.'' Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2003; pg. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in [[New York City]], Gilbert became concerned with the cramped and overly centralized living conditions of the [[working class]], seeing this as a major public health hazard, and began thinking about urban rapid transit as the key to provision of more sanitary living conditions.&lt;ref name=Middleton /&gt;

During the [[American Civil War]], he joined the [[5th New York Volunteer Infantry]] as a surgeon, performing the first surgical procedure during the war at the [[Battle of Big Bethel]]. He eventually became Medical Director and Superintendent of the [[United States Army Hospitals]].&lt;ref name=Middleton /&gt;

===Rapid transit visionary===

Towards the end of the war, Gilbert's own medical issues prevented him from a further career in this field.

Gilbert subsequently became Superintendent of the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]], where he worked on developing rapid transport in the New York City area.&lt;ref name=Middleton /&gt;

In 1870 Gilbert obtained a patent for an [[elevated railway]] using the principle of [[pneumatics]].&lt;ref name=Middleton /&gt; Gilbert incorporated a company knowns as the Gilbert Elevated Railway Company but had difficulty obtaining adequate financing for the venture.&lt;ref name=Middleton /&gt; Ultimately Gilbert was forced to surrender control of the company to the New York Loan and Improvement Company in order to obtain sufficient capital.&lt;ref name=Middleton /&gt;  The company constructed the Sixth Avenue road, known as ''Gilbert Elevated Railroad,'' which opened in 1878.&lt;ref name=Middleton /&gt; Gilbert was forced out of the company by his partners soon after the road opened, however, effectively ending his career.&lt;ref name=Middleton /&gt;

===Death and legacy===

With his health failing, Gilbert died in [[New York City]] on July 10, 1885. He was just 53 years old at the time of his death.

[[File:Thomas Wright (geologist).jpg|thumb|Thomas Wright]]
'''Thomas Wright''' FRS (9 November 1809 – 17 November 1884) was a Scottish surgeon and [[palaeontologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Wright, Thomas (1809-1884)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright published a number of papers on the fossils which he had collected in the [[Cotswolds]], including ''Lias Ammonites of the British Isles''.

Wright was born in [[Paisley (Scotland)|Paisley]] and studied at the Royal college of Surgeons in [[Dublin]]. In 1846 he moved to [[Cheltenham]], where he became medical officer of health to the urban district, and surgeon at [[Cheltenham General Hospital]]. He won the [[Wollaston Medal]] in 1878 and became a fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1879.

After his death part of his fossil collection was sold to the [[British Museum]].

What exactly time "is" and how it works is still largely undefined, except in relation to the other fundamental quantities.  --&gt; In classical, non-relativistic physics it is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity and, like [[length]], [[mass]], and [[electric charge|charge]], is usually described as a [[fundamental quantity]]. Time can be combined mathematically with other [[physical quantities]] to [[Formal proof|derive]] other concepts such as [[motion (physics)|motion]], [[kinetic energy]] and time-dependent [[Field (physics)|fields]].  ''[[:category:Timekeeping|Timekeeping]]'' is a complex of technological and scientific issues, and part of the foundation of ''[[recordkeeping]]''.

==Markers of time==

{{main|History of timekeeping devices}}
Before there were clocks, time was measured by those physical processes&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Galileo]] measured the period of a [[simple harmonic oscillator]] with his [[pulse]].&lt;/ref&gt; which were understandable to each epoch of civilization:&lt;ref name=OttoN/&gt;
*the first appearance (see: [[heliacal rising]]) of [[Sirius]] to mark the [[flooding of the Nile]] each year&lt;ref name=OttoN&gt;[[Otto Neugebauer]] ''The Exact Sciences in Antiquity''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1952; 2nd edition, Brown University Press, 1957; reprint, New York: Dover publications, 1969. Page 82.&lt;/ref&gt;
*the periodic succession of [[night]] and [[day]], seemingly eternally&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [[William Shakespeare]] ''Hamlet'': " ... to thine own self be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man."&lt;/ref&gt;
*the position on the horizon of the first appearance of the sun at dawn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solar-center.stanford.edu/AO/dawn-rising.html |title=Heliacal/Dawn Risings |publisher=Solar-center.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the position of the sun in the sky&lt;ref&gt;[http://eo.nso.edu/MrSunspot/answerbook/sundial.html Farmers have used the sun to mark time for thousands of years, as the most ancient method of telling time.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726073719/http://eo.nso.edu/MrSunspot/answerbook/sundial.html |date=2010-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the marking of the moment of [[noon]]time during the day&lt;ref&gt;[[Eratosthenes]] used this criterion in his measurement of the circumference of Earth&lt;/ref&gt;
*the length of the shadow cast by a [[gnomon]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Hoyle]] (1962), ''Astronomy: A history of man's investigation of the universe'', Crescent Books, Inc., London LC 62-14108, p.31''&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually,&lt;ref&gt;The Mesopotamian (modern-day Iraq) astronomers recorded astronomical observations with the naked eye, more than 3500 years ago. [[P. W. Bridgman]] defined his [[operational definition]] in the twentieth c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Naked-eye stars|Naked eye astronomy]] became obsolete in 1609 with Galileo's observations with a telescope. Galileo Galilei Linceo, [http://www.rarebookroom.org/Control/galsid/index.html ''Sidereus Nuncius''] (''[[Starry Messenger]]'') 1610.&lt;/ref&gt; it became possible to characterize the passage of time with instrumentation, using [[operational definition]]s. Simultaneously, our conception of time has evolved, as shown below.&lt;ref&gt;http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/gpstt.html http://www.phys.lsu.edu/mog/mog9/node9.html Today, automated astronomical observations from satellites and spacecraft require relativistic corrections of the reported positions.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--This sentence sounds a little like POV, unless it is backed up by references. Thanks. Please read Neugebauer. Fred Hoyle also gives some of these examples. Added a reference which requires reading the article below. --&gt;

==The unit of measurement of time: the second==
In the [[International System of Units]] (SI),  the unit of time is the [[second]] (symbol: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}&lt;/math&gt;). It is a [[SI base unit]], and it has been defined since 1967 as "the duration of {{nowrap|9 192 631 770}} periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the [[caesium]] 133 atom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-06-08
|work=SI brochure
|pages=Section 2.1.1.3
|publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM)
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is based on the operation of a caesium [[atomic clock]]. These clocks became practical for use as primary reference standards after about 1955 and have been in use ever since.

The [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] [[timestamp]] in use worldwide is an atomic time standard. The relative accuracy of such a time standard is currently on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tf.nist.gov/general/pdf/1823.pdf S. R. Jefferts et al., "Accuracy evaluation of NIST-F1".]&lt;/ref&gt; (corresponding to 1 second in approximately 30 million years).  The smallest time step considered theoretically observable is called the [[Planck time]], which is approximately 5.391×10&lt;sup&gt;−44&lt;/sup&gt; seconds - many orders of magnitude below the resolution of current time standards.

The caesium atomic clock became practical after 1950 when advances in electronics enabled reliable measurement of the microwave frequencies it generates. As further advances occurred, [[Atomic clock#Research| atomic clock research]] has progressed to ever-higher frequencies, which can provide higher accuracy and higher precision. Clocks based on these techniques have been developed but are not yet in use as primary reference standards.

==Conceptions of time==
{{main|Time}}
[[File:Andromeda galaxy Ssc2005-20a1.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Andromeda galaxy ([[Andromeda Galaxy|M31]]) is two million [[light-year]]s away. Thus we are viewing M31's light from two million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;Fred Adams and Greg Laughlin (1999), ''Five Ages of the Universe'' {{ISBN|0-684-86576-9}} p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; a time before [[human]]s existed on Earth.]]
[[Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and most people up until the 20th century thought that time was the same for everyone everywhere. This is the basis for [[:category:timelines|timeline]]s, where time is a [[parameter]]. The modern conception of time is based on [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]], in which rates of time run differently depending on relative motion, and [[space]] and time are merged into [[spacetime]], where we live on a [[world line]] rather than a timeline. In this view time is a [[coordinate]]. According to the prevailing [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[Scientific modelling|model]] of the [[Big Bang]] theory time itself began as part of the entire [[Universe]] about 13.8 billion years ago.

===Regularities in nature===
{{Main|History of science}}
In order to measure time, one can record the number of occurrences (events) of some [[periodic function|periodic]] [[phenomenon]]. The regular recurrences of the [[seasons]], the [[motion (physics)|motion]]s of the [[sun]], [[moon]] and [[star]]s were noted and tabulated for millennia, before the [[laws of physics]] were formulated. The sun was the arbiter of the flow of time, but [[time]] was known only to the [[hour]] for [[millennium|millennia]], hence, the use of the [[gnomon]] was known across most of the world, especially [[Eurasia]], and at least as far southward as the jungles of [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hose and William McDougall (1912) ''The Pagan Tribes of Borneo'',  [https://books.google.com/books?id=phTSAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA108-IA1&amp;dq=Pagan+Tribes+of+Borneo+1912+aso+do+plate+60&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zd2ATOu5K8P68AaF4dlS&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Plate 60.] Kenyahs measuring the Length of the Shadow  at Noon to determine the Time for sowing PADI p. 108. This photograph is reproduced as plate B in Fred Hoyle (1962), ''Astronomy: A history of man's investigation of the universe'', Crescent Books, Inc., London LC 62-14108, p.31. The measurement process is explained by: Gene Ammarell (1997), "Astronomy in the Indo-Malay Archipelago", p.119, ''Encyclopaedia of the history of science, technology, and medicine in non-western cultures'', [[Helaine Selin]], ed., which describes Kenyah Tribesmen of Borneo measuring  the shadow cast by a gnomon, or ''tukar do'' with a measuring scale, or ''aso do''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, the astronomical observatories maintained for religious purposes became accurate enough to ascertain the regular motions of the stars, and even some of the planets.

At first, [[timekeeping]] was done by hand by priests, and then for commerce, with watchmen to note time as part of their duties.
The tabulation of the [[equinox]]es, the [[Marine sandglass|sandglass]], and the [[water clock]] became more and more accurate, and finally reliable.  For ships at sea, boys were used to turn the [[Marine sandglass|sandglass]]es and to call the hours.

====Mechanical clocks====
[[Richard of Wallingford]] (1292–1336), abbot of St. Alban's abbey, famously built a [[Clock#Early mechanical clocks|mechanical clock]] as an astronomical [[orrery]] about 1330.&lt;ref&gt;North, J. (2004) ''God's Clockmaker: Richard of Wallingford and the Invention of Time''. Oxbow Books. {{ISBN|1-85285-451-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watson, E (1979) "The St Albans Clock of Richard of Wallingford". ''Antiquarian Horology'' 372-384.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of Richard of Wallingford, the use of [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]]s and [[gear]]s allowed the towns of Europe to create mechanisms to display the time on their respective town clocks; by the time of the scientific revolution, the clocks became miniaturized enough for families to share a personal clock, or perhaps a pocket watch. At first, only kings could afford them.  [[Pendulum clock]]s were widely used in the 18th and 19th century. They have largely been replaced in general use by quartz and [[digital clock]]s. [[Atomic clocks]] can theoretically keep accurate time for millions of years. They are appropriate for [[Standardization|standard]]s  and scientific use.

=== Galileo: the flow of time ===
{{main|reproducibility}}
In 1583, [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642) discovered that a [[harmonic oscillator|pendulum's harmonic motion]] has a constant period, which he learned by timing the motion of a swaying lamp in [[Simple harmonic motion|harmonic motion]] at [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] at the cathedral of [[Pisa]], with his [[pulse]].&lt;ref&gt;Jo Ellen Barnett, ''Time's Pendulum'' {{ISBN|0-306-45787-3}} p.99.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' (1638), [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] used a [[water clock]] to measure the time taken for a bronze ball to roll a known distance down an [[inclined plane]]; this clock was 
:"a large vessel of water placed in an elevated position; to the bottom of this vessel was soldered a pipe of small diameter giving a thin jet of water, which we collected in a small glass during the time of each descent, whether for the whole length of the channel or for a part of its length; the water thus collected was weighed, after each descent, on a very accurate balance; the differences and ratios of these weights gave us the differences and ratios of the times, and this with such accuracy that although the operation was repeated many, many times, there was no appreciable discrepancy in the results."&lt;ref name="galileo"&gt;[[Galileo]] 1638 ''Discorsi e dimostrazioni matematiche, intorno á due nuoue scienze'' '''213''',  Leida, Appresso gli Elsevirii (Louis Elsevier), or  ''Mathematical discourses and demonstrations, relating to [[Two New Sciences]]'', English translation by Henry Crew and Alfonso de Salvio 1914. Section '''213''' is reprinted on pages 534-535 of ''On the Shoulders of Giants'':The Great Works of Physics and Astronomy (works by [[Copernicus]], [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], [[Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]). [[Stephen Hawking]], ed. 2002 {{ISBN|0-7624-1348-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo's experimental setup to measure the literal ''[[Two New Sciences#The flow of time|flow of time]]'', in order to describe the motion of a ball, preceded [[Isaac Newton]]'s statement in his [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]:
:''I do not define [[time]], [[space]], [[Location (geography)|place]] and [[motion (physics)|motion]], as being well known to all.''&lt;ref name="galileo2"&gt;[[Isaac Newton|Newton]] 1687 ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', Londini, Jussu Societatis Regiae ac Typis J. Streater,  or  '''''[[The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy]]''''', [[London]], English translation by [[Andrew Motte]] 1700s. From part of the Scholium, reprinted on page 737 of ''On the Shoulders of Giants'':The Great Works of Physics and Astronomy (works by [[Copernicus]], [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], [[Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]). [[Stephen Hawking]], ed. 2002 {{ISBN|0-7624-1348-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Galilean transformation]]s assume that time is the same for all [[Frame of reference|reference frames]].

===Newton's physics: linear time===
{{main|classical physics}}
In or around 1665, when [[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727) derived the motion of objects falling under [[gravity]], the first clear formulation for [[mathematical physics]] of a treatment of time began: linear time, conceived as a ''universal clock''.

:''Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature flows equably without regard to anything external, and by another name is called duration: relative, apparent, and common time, is some sensible and external (whether accurate or unequable)  measure of duration by the means of motion, which is commonly used instead of true time; such as an hour, a day, a month, a year.''&lt;ref name="newton"&gt;[[Isaac Newton|Newton]] 1687 page 738.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[water clock]] mechanism described by Galileo was engineered to provide [[laminar flow]] of the water during the experiments, thus providing a constant flow of water for the durations of the experiments, and embodying what Newton called ''duration''.

In this section, the relationships listed below treat time as a parameter which serves as an index to the behavior of the physical system under consideration. Because Newton's [[fluent (mathematics)|fluent]]s treat  a ''linear flow of time'' (what he called ''mathematical time''), time could be considered to be a linearly varying parameter, an abstraction of the march of the hours on the face of a clock. Calendars and ship's logs could then be mapped to the march of the hours, days, months, years and centuries.

===Thermodynamics and the paradox of irreversibility===
{{main|arrow of time}}
By 1798, [[Benjamin Thompson]] (1753–1814) had discovered that work could be transformed to [[heat]] without limit - a precursor of the conservation of energy or
*[[Conservation of energy|1st law of thermodynamics]]
In 1824 [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] (1796–1832) scientifically analyzed the [[steam engines]] with his [[Carnot cycle]], an abstract engine. [[Rudolf Clausius]] (1822–1888) noted a measure of disorder, or [[entropy]], which affects the continually decreasing amount of free energy which is available to a Carnot engine in the:
*[[Entropy|2nd law of thermodynamics]]
&lt;!--
:&lt;math&gt;E =\, \cdots&lt;/math&gt; (thermal energy)

:&lt;math&gt;ds =\, \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial ^2T}{\partial t^2} =\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

--&gt; 
Thus the continual march of a thermodynamic system, from lesser to greater entropy, at any given temperature, defines an [[arrow of time]]. In particular, [[Stephen Hawking]] identifies three arrows of time:&lt;ref name="einstein2"&gt;pp. 182-195. [[Stephen Hawking]] 1996. ''The Illustrated Brief History of Time'': updated and expanded edition  {{ISBN|0-553-10374-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Psychological arrow of time - our perception of an inexorable flow.
*Thermodynamic arrow of time - distinguished by the growth of [[entropy]].
*Cosmological arrow of time - distinguished by the expansion of the universe.

Entropy is maximum in an isolated thermodynamic system, and increases. In contrast, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] (1887–1961) pointed out that [[life]] depends on a ''"negative entropy flow"''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Schrödinger]] (1945) ''What is Life?''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ilya Prigogine]] (1917–2003) stated that other thermodynamic systems which, like life, are also far from equilibrium, can also exhibit stable spatio-temporal structures. Soon afterward, the [[Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction]]s&lt;ref&gt;G. Nicolis and I. Prigogine (1989), ''Exploring Complexity''&lt;/ref&gt; were reported, which demonstrate oscillating colors in a chemical solution.&lt;ref&gt;R. Kapral and K. Showalter, eds. (1995), ''Chemical Waves and Patterns''&lt;/ref&gt; These nonequilibrium thermodynamic branches reach a ''[[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation point]]'', which is unstable, and another thermodynamic branch becomes stable in its stead.&lt;ref&gt;Ilya Prigogine (1996) ''The End of Certainty'' pp. 63-71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electromagnetism and the speed of light===
{{main|Maxwell's equations}}
In 1864, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] (1831–1879) presented a combined theory of [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]].  He combined all the laws then known relating to those two phenomenon into four equations.  These [[vector calculus]] equations which use the [[del|del operator]] (&lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;) are known as [[Maxwell's equations]] for [[electromagnetism]].

In free space (that is, space not containing [[electric charge]]s), the equations take the form (using [[International System of Units|SI units]]):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where
:''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[vacuum permittivity|electric permittivity]] and the [[vacuum permeability|magnetic permeability of free space]];
:''c'' = &lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in free space, 299 792 458 [[metre|m]]/[[second|s]];
:'''E''' is the electric field;
:'''B''' is the magnetic field.

These equations allow for solutions in the form of electromagnetic waves. The wave is formed by an electric field and a magnetic field oscillating together, perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation. These waves always propagate at the speed of light ''c'', regardless of the velocity of the electric charge that generated them.

The fact that light is predicted to always travel at speed ''c'' would be incompatible with Galilean relativity if Maxwell's equations were assumed to hold in any [[inertial frame]] (reference frame with constant velocity), because the Galilean transformations predict the speed to decrease (or increase) in the reference frame of an observer traveling parallel (or antiparallel) to the light.

It was expected that there was one absolute reference frame, that of the [[luminiferous aether]], in which Maxwell's equations held unmodified in the known form.

The [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] failed to detect any difference in the relative speed of light due to the motion of the Earth relative to the luminiferous aether, suggesting that Maxwell's equations did, in fact, hold in all frames. In 1875, [[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1853–1928) discovered [[Lorentz transformation]]s, which left Maxwell's equations unchanged, allowing Michelson and Morley's negative result to be explained. [[Henri Poincaré]] (1854–1912) noted the importance of Lorentz's transformation and popularized it. In particular, the railroad car description can be found in ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Henri Poincaré, (1902). ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'' [http://spartan.ac.brocku.ca/~lward/Poincare/Poincare_1905_toc.html Eprint] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004103729/http://spartan.ac.brocku.ca/~lward/Poincare/Poincare_1905_toc.html |date=2006-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was published before Einstein's articles of 1905.

The Lorentz transformation predicted [[space contraction]] and [[time dilation]]; until 1905, the former was interpreted as a physical contraction of objects moving with respect to the aether, due to the modification of the intermolecular forces (of electric nature), while the latter was thought to be just a mathematical stipulation. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

===Einstein's physics: spacetime===
{{main|Special relativity|General relativity}}

[[Albert Einstein]]'s 1905 [[special relativity]] challenged the notion of absolute time, and could only formulate a definition of [[synchronization]] for clocks that mark a linear flow of time:
{{Quote|If at the point A of space there is a clock, an observer at A can determine the time values of events in the immediate proximity of A by finding the positions of the hands which are simultaneous with these events. If there is at the point B of space another clock in all respects resembling the one at A, it is possible for an observer at B to determine the time values of events in the immediate neighbourhood of B.

But it is not possible without further assumption to compare, in respect of time, an event at A with an event at B. We have so far defined only an "A time" and a "B time."

We have not defined a common "time" for A and B, for the latter cannot be defined at all unless we establish ''by definition'' that the "time" required by light to travel from A to B equals the "time" it requires to travel from B to A. Let a ray of light start at the "A time" ''t''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; from A towards B, let it at the "B time" ''t''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; be reflected at B in the direction of A, and arrive again at A at the “A time” ''t''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;.

In accordance with definition the two clocks synchronize if
: &lt;math&gt;t_\text{B} - t_\text{A} = t'_\text{A} - t_\text{B}\text{.}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

We assume that this definition of synchronism is free from contradictions, and possible for any number of points; and that the following relations are universally valid:—
#If the clock at B synchronizes with the clock at A, the clock at A synchronizes with the clock at B.
#If the clock at A synchronizes with the clock at B and also with the clock at C, the clocks at B and C also synchronize with each other.

Teubner, Leipzig. '''''[[Special relativity|The Principles of Relativity]]: A Collection of Original Papers on the Special Theory of Relativity''''', by H.A. Lorentz, A. Einstein, H. Minkowski, and W. H. Weyl, is part of ''Fortschritte der mathematischen Wissenschaften in Monographien, Heft 2''. The   English translation is by W. Perrett and G.B. Jeffrey, reprinted on page 1169 of ''On the Shoulders of Giants'':The Great Works of Physics and Astronomy (works by [[Copernicus]], [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], [[Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]). [[Stephen Hawking]], ed. 2002 {{ISBN|0-7624-1348-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Einstein showed that if the speed of light is not changing between reference frames, space and time must be so that the moving observer will measure the same speed of light as the stationary one because velocity is ''defined'' by space and time:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}={d\mathbf{r}\over dt} \text{,}&lt;/math&gt; where '''r''' is position and ''t'' is time.

Indeed, the Lorentz transformation (for two reference frames in relative motion, whose ''x'' axis is directed in the direction of the relative velocity)

x' &amp;= \gamma(x - vt)\\

z' &amp;= z
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
can be said to "mix" space and time in a way similar to the way a Euclidean rotation around the ''z'' axis mixes ''x'' and ''y'' coordinates. Consequences of this include [[relativity of simultaneity]]. [[File:Relativity of Simultaneity.svg|thumb|Event B is simultaneous with A in the green reference frame, but it occurred
before in the blue frame, and will occur later in the red frame.]] More specifically, the Lorentz transformation is a hyperbolic rotation &lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
 ct' \\
 x'
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
 \cosh \phi &amp; - \sinh \phi  \\
 - \sinh \phi &amp; \cosh \phi 
\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}
 ct \\
 x
\end{pmatrix} \text{ where } \phi = \operatorname{artanh}\,\frac{v}{c} \text{,}
&lt;/math&gt; which is a change of coordinates in the four-dimensional [[Minkowski space]], a dimension of which is ''ct''. (In [[Euclidean space]] an ordinary rotation &lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
 x' \\
 y'
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
 \cos \theta &amp; - \sin \theta  \\
 \sin \theta &amp; \cos \theta 
\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}
 x \\
 y
\end{pmatrix} 
&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding change of coordinates.) The speed of light ''c'' can be seen as just a conversion factor needed because we measure the dimensions of spacetime in different units; since the [[metre]] is currently defined in terms of the second, it has the ''exact'' value of {{nowrap|299&amp;thinsp;792&amp;thinsp;458 m/s}}.  We would need a similar factor in Euclidean space if, for example, we measured width in nautical miles and depth in feet. In physics, sometimes [[natural units|units of measurement in which ''c'' = 1]] are used to simplify equations.

Time in a "moving" reference frame is shown to run more slowly than in a "stationary" one by the following relation (which can be derived by the Lorentz transformation by putting ∆''x''&amp;prime; = 0, ∆''τ'' = ∆''t''&amp;prime;):
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t= {{\Delta \tau}\over\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
*∆''τ'' is the time between two events as measured in the moving reference frame in which they occur at the same place (e.g. two ticks on a moving clock); it is called the [[proper time]] between the two events;
*∆''t'' is the time between these same two events, but as measured in the stationary reference frame;
*''v'' is the speed of the moving reference frame relative to the stationary one;
*''c'' is the [[speed of light]].

Moving objects therefore are said to ''show a slower passage of time''. This is known as [[time dilation]].

These transformations are only valid for two frames at ''constant'' relative velocity. Naively applying them to other situations gives rise to such [[paradox]]es as the [[twin paradox]].

That paradox can be resolved using for instance Einstein's [[General theory of relativity]], which uses [[Riemannian geometry]], geometry in accelerated, noninertial reference frames.  Employing the [[metric tensor]] which describes [[Minkowski space]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[(dx^1)^2+(dx^2)^2+(dx^3)^2-c(dt)^2)\right],&lt;/math&gt;

Einstein developed a geometric solution to Lorentz's transformation that preserves [[Maxwell's equations]].  His [[Einstein's field equations|field equations]] give an exact relationship between the measurements of space and time in a given region of [[spacetime]] and the energy density of that region.

Einstein's equations predict that time should be altered by the presence of [[gravitational fields]] (see the [[Schwarzschild metric]]):

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{dt}{\sqrt{\left( 1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2} \right ) dt^2 - \frac{1}{c^2}\left ( 1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2} \right )^{-1} dr^2 - \frac{r^2}{c^2} d\theta^2 - \frac{r^2}{c^2} \sin^2 \theta \; d\phi^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

:&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational time dilation]] of an object at a distance of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;dt&lt;/math&gt; is the change in coordinate time, or the interval of coordinate time.

:&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]]

:&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mass]] generating the field

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\left( 1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2} \right ) dt^2 - \frac{1}{c^2}\left ( 1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2} \right )^{-1} dr^2 - \frac{r^2}{c^2} d\theta^2 - \frac{r^2}{c^2} \sin^2 \theta \; d\phi^2}&lt;/math&gt; is the change in [[proper time]] &lt;math&gt;d\tau&lt;/math&gt;, or the interval of [[proper time]].

Or one could use the following simpler approximation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dt}{d\tau} =  \frac{1}{ \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{2GM}{rc^2} \right)}}. &lt;/math&gt;

That is, the stronger the gravitational field (and, thus, the larger the [[acceleration]]), the more slowly time runs. The predictions of time dilation are confirmed by [[particle accelerator|particle acceleration]] experiments and [[cosmic ray]] evidence, where moving particles [[particle decay|decay more slowly]] than their less energetic counterparts.  Gravitational time dilation gives rise to the phenomenon of [[gravitational redshift]] and [[Shapiro delay|Shapiro signal travel time delays]] near massive objects such as the sun.  The [[Global Positioning System]] must also adjust signals to account for this effect.

According to Einstein's general theory of relativity, a freely moving particle traces a history in spacetime that maximises its proper time. This phenomenon is also referred to as the principle of maximal aging, and was described by [[Edwin F. Taylor|Taylor]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler]] as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
::''"Principle of Extremal Aging: The path a free object takes between two events in spacetime is the path for which the time lapse between these events, recorded on the object's wristwatch, is an extremum."''

Einstein's theory was motivated by the assumption that every point in the universe can be treated as a 'center', and that correspondingly, physics must act the same in all reference frames.  His simple and elegant theory shows that time is relative to an [[inertial frame]].  In an inertial frame, [[Newton's first law]] holds; it has its own local geometry, and therefore its ''own'' measurements of space and time; ''there is no 'universal clock'''. An act of synchronization must be performed between two systems, at the least.

=== Time in quantum mechanics ===
{{see also|quantum mechanics}}

There is a time parameter in the equations of [[quantum mechanics]]. The [[Schrödinger equation]]&lt;ref name="schrodinger"&gt;E. Schrödinger, [[Phys. Rev.]] '''28''' 1049 (1926)&lt;/ref&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; H(t) \left| \psi (t) \right\rangle = i \hbar {\partial\over\partial t} \left| \psi (t) \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
One solution can be
:&lt;math&gt; | \psi_e(t) \rangle = e^{-iHt / \hbar} | \psi_e(0) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.
where &lt;math&gt; e^{-iHt / \hbar} &lt;/math&gt;
is called the [[time evolution operator]], and ''H'' is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]].

But the [[Schrödinger picture]] shown above is equivalent to the [[Heisenberg picture]], which enjoys a similarity to the Poisson brackets of classical mechanics. The [[Poisson bracket]]s are superseded by a nonzero [[commutator]], say [H,A] for [[observable]] A, and Hamiltonian  H:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}A=(i\hbar)^{-1}[A,H]+\left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial t}\right)_\mathrm{classical}.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation denotes an [[uncertainty principle|uncertainty relation]] in quantum physics. For example, with ''time'' (the observable A), the ''energy'' E (from the Hamiltonian H) gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E \Delta T \ge \frac{\hbar}{2} &lt;/math&gt;
:where
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt; is the uncertainty in energy
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; is the uncertainty in time
:&lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]]
The more [[Accuracy and precision|precisely]] one measures the duration of a [[Phenomenon|sequence of events]], the less precisely one can measure the energy associated with that sequence, and vice versa.  This equation is different from the standard uncertainty principle, because time is not an [[operator (physics)|operator]] in quantum mechanics.

Corresponding [[commutator]] relations also hold for momentum ''p'' and position ''q'', which are [[conjugate variables]] of each other, along with a corresponding uncertainty principle in  momentum and position, similar to the energy and time relation above.

Quantum mechanics explains the properties of the [[periodic table]] of the [[chemical element|elements]]. Starting with [[Otto Stern]]'s and [[Walter Gerlach]]'s experiment with [[molecular beam]]s in a magnetic field, [[Isidor Rabi]] (1898–1988), was able to [[modulation|modulate]] the magnetic resonance of the beam. In 1945 Rabi then suggested that this technique be the basis of a clock&lt;ref&gt;[http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/cesium/atomichistory.htm 	 A Brief History of Atomic Clocks at NIST] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214125707/http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/cesium/atomichistory.htm |date=2009-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[resonant frequency]] of an atomic beam.

==Dynamical systems==
See [[dynamical systems and chaos theory]], [[dissipative structures]]

One could say that time is a [[parameterization]] of a [[dynamical system]] that allows the geometry of the system to be manifested and operated on. It has been asserted that ''time is an implicit consequence of [[Chaos theory|chaos]]'' (i.e. [[nonlinearity]]/[[irreversibility]]): the [[characteristic time]], or rate of [[information entropy]] production, of a [[system]]. [[Benoît Mandelbrot|Mandelbrot]] introduces [[intrinsic time]] in his book ''Multifractals and [[1/f noise]]''.

==Signalling==
{| class="infobox plainlist"
|-

Signalling is one application of the [[electromagnetic wave]]s described above. In general, a signal is part of [[communication]] between parties and places. One example might be a [[yellow ribbon]] tied to a tree, or the ringing of a [[church bell]]. A signal can be part of a [[conversation]], which involves a [[Communications protocol|protocol]]. Another signal might be the position of the hour hand on a town clock or a railway station. An interested party might wish to view that clock, to learn the time.  See: [[Time ball]], an early form of [[Time signal]].
[[File:Lorentz transform of world line.gif|thumb|left|Evolution of a [[world line]] of an accelerated massive particle. This world line is restricted to the [[timelike]] top and bottom sections of this [[spacetime]] figure; this world line cannot cross the top ([[future]]) or the bottom ([[past]]) [[light cone]]. The left and right sections (which are outside the light cones) are [[spacelike]].]]
We as observers can still signal different parties and places as long as we live within their ''past'' [[light cone]]. But we cannot receive signals from those parties and places outside our ''past'' light cone.

Along with the formulation of the equations for the electromagnetic wave, the field of [[telecommunication]] could be founded. 
&lt;!--
Messages and signals were still local and based upon common cultures, languages and religions. If parties had to cross cultures, a ''lingua franca'' had to be relied upon, as well as upon a medium of exchange. But the scarcity of goods could still create common motivation for trade, legal or illegal. And eventually illegal or immoral trade was ceased due to public outcry of messages. Theft could not be condoned when the cultures could no longer hide the crimes or injustice. 
--&gt;In 19th century [[telegraphy]], [[electrical circuit]]s, some spanning [[continent]]s and [[ocean]]s, could transmit [[code]]s - simple dots, dashes and spaces. From this, a series of technical issues have emerged; see [[:Category:Synchronization]]. But it is safe to say that our signalling systems can be only approximately [[Synchronization|synchronized]], a [[plesiochronous]] condition, from which [[jitter]] need be eliminated.

That said, [[system]]s ''can'' be synchronized (at an engineering approximation), using technologies like [[GPS]]. The GPS satellites must account for the effects of gravitation and other relativistic factors in their circuitry. See: [[Self-clocking signal]].

==Technology for timekeeping standards==
The [[primary time standard]] in the U.S. is currently [[NIST-F1]], a [[laser]]-cooled [[Caesium|Cs]] fountain,&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Meekhof, S. R. Jefferts, M. Stepanovíc, and T. E. Parker (2001) "Accuracy Evaluation of a Cesium Fountain Primary Frequency Standard at NIST", ''IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement''. '''50''', no. 2, (April 2001) pp. 507-509&lt;/ref&gt; the latest in a series of time and frequency standards, from the [[ammonia]]-based atomic clock (1949) to the [[caesium]]-based NBS-1 (1952) to NIST-7 (1993). The respective clock uncertainty declined from 10,000 nanoseconds per day to 0.5 nanoseconds per day in 5 decades.&lt;ref&gt;James Jespersen and Jane Fitz-Randolph (1999). ''From sundials to atomic clocks : understanding time and frequency''. Washington, D.C. : U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Technology Administration, National Institute of Standards and Technology. 308 p. : ill. ; 28 cm.
{{ISBN|0-16-050010-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the clock uncertainty for NIST-F1 was  0.1 nanoseconds/day. Development of increasingly accurate frequency standards is underway.

In this  time and frequency standard, a population of caesium atoms is laser-cooled to temperatures of one [[microkelvin]]. The atoms collect in a ball shaped by six lasers, two for each spatial dimension, vertical (up/down), horizontal (left/right), and back/forth. The vertical lasers push the caesium ball through a microwave cavity. As the ball is cooled, the caesium population cools to its ground state and emits light at its natural frequency, stated in the definition of ''second'' above. Eleven physical effects are accounted for in the emissions from the caesium population, which are then controlled for in the NIST-F1 clock. These results are reported to [[BIPM]].

Additionally, a reference [[Maser#Hydrogen maser|hydrogen maser]] is also reported to BIPM as   a frequency standard for [[International Atomic Time|TAI]] ([[International Atomic Time|international atomic time]]).

The measurement of time is overseen by [[BIPM]] (''Bureau International des Poids et Mesures''), located in [[Sèvres]], France, which  ensures uniformity of measurements and their traceability to the [[International System of Units]] ([[SI]]) worldwide. BIPM operates under  authority of the [[Metre Convention]], a diplomatic treaty between fifty-one nations, the Member States of the Convention, through a series of Consultative Committees, whose members are the respective national metrology laboratories.

==Time in cosmology==
{{main|physical cosmology}}
The equations of general relativity predict a non-static universe. However, Einstein accepted only a static universe, and modified the Einstein field equation to reflect this by adding the [[cosmological constant]], which he later described as the biggest mistake of his life.  But  in 1927, [[Georges Lemaître]] (1894–1966) argued, on the basis of [[general relativity]], that the universe originated in a primordial explosion. At the fifth [[Solvay conference]], that year, Einstein brushed him off with "{{lang|fr|Vos calculs sont corrects, mais votre physique est abominable.}}"&lt;ref&gt;John C. Mather and John Boslough (1996), ''The Very First Light'' {{ISBN|0-465-01575-1}} p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; (“Your math is correct, but your physics is abominable”). In 1929, [[Edwin Hubble]] (1889–1953) announced his discovery of the [[expanding universe]].  The current generally accepted cosmological model, the [[Lambda-CDM model]], has a positive cosmological constant and thus not only an expanding universe but an accelerating expanding universe.

If the universe were expanding, then it must have been much smaller and therefore hotter and denser in the past. [[George Gamow]] (1904–1968) hypothesized that the abundance of the elements in the Periodic Table of the Elements, might be accounted for by nuclear reactions in a hot dense universe. He was disputed by [[Fred Hoyle]] (1915–2001), who invented the term '[[Big Bang]]' to disparage it. [[Enrico Fermi|Fermi]] and others noted that this process would have stopped after only the light elements were created, and thus did not account for the abundance of heavier elements.
[[File:WMAP.jpg|thumb|right|[[WMAP]] fluctuations of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]&lt;ref&gt;[[George Smoot]] and Keay Davidson (1993) ''[[Wrinkles in Time]]'' {{ISBN|0-688-12330-9}} A memoir of the experiment program for detecting the predicted fluctuations in the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Gamow's prediction was a 5–10-[[kelvin]] [[black-body radiation]] temperature for the universe, after it cooled during the expansion. This was corroborated by Penzias and Wilson in 1965. Subsequent experiments arrived at a 2.7&amp;nbsp;kelvins temperature, corresponding to an [[age of the universe]] of 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang.

This dramatic result has raised issues: what happened between the singularity of the Big Bang and the Planck time, which, after all, is the smallest observable time.  When might have time separated out from the [[spacetime foam]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Rees]] (1997), ''Before the Beginning'' {{ISBN|0-201-15142-1}} p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; there are only hints based on broken symmetries (see [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking]], [[Timeline of the Big Bang]], and the articles in [[:Category:Physical cosmology]]).

[[General relativity]] gave us our modern notion of the expanding universe that started in the Big Bang.  Using relativity and quantum theory we have been able to roughly reconstruct the history of the universe.  In our [[age of the universe|epoch]], during which  electromagnetic waves can propagate without being disturbed by conductors or charges, we can see the stars, at great distances from us, in the night sky. (Before this epoch, there was a time, 300,000 years after the [[Big Bang]], during which starlight would not have been visible.)

[[Gabriele Veneziano]] suggests that [[space]] and [[time]] might switch roles within a black hole,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gabriele Veneziano]], "The myth of the beginning of time", ''A Matter of Time''. ''Scientific American'', '''16''' no. 1, 2006. pp.72-81. &lt;/ref&gt; and that the big bang occurred when physical conditions dictated by string theory initiate a bounce. [[Roger Penrose]] suggests that the transition from a previous universe to a next universe satisfy the conditions imposed by the [[Weyl curvature hypothesis]] in a [[conformal transformation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Penrose]], public lecture at University of British Columbia, August 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ilya Prigogine]]'s reprise is ''"[[Time]] precedes [[existence]]"''. In contrast to the views of Newton, of Einstein, and of quantum physics, which offer a symmetric view of time (as discussed above), Prigogine points out that statistical and thermodynamic physics can explain [[Irreversible process|irreversible phenomena]],&lt;ref&gt;Prigogine, Ilya (1996), ''The End of Certainty: Time, Chaos and the New Laws of Nature''. {{ISBN|0-684-83705-6}}  On pages 163 and 182.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[arrow of time]] and the [[Big Bang]].

'''WISEP J190648.47+401106.8''' (shortened to '''W1906+40''') is a [[Brown dwarf#Spectral class L|L-dwarf star]]. In 2015 it was shown to have on its surface a storm the size of [[Jupiter]]'s [[Great Red Spot]]. The storm rotates around the star roughly every 9 hours and has lasted since at least 2013, when observations of the storm began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA Telescopes Detect Jupiter-Like Storm on Small Star |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4786 |work=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] |date=10 December 2015 |accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The star is 53 light-years from Earth, has an intrinsic brightness of 0.0002 that of the sun, a radius of 0.9 Jupiters, and a surface temperature of 2,311 K. The star emits significant flares.&lt;ref name="Simbad"&gt;{{cite web |title=WISEP J190648.47+401106.8 |url=http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=WISEP+J190648.47%2B401106.8 |work=SIMBAD |date=26 November 2015 |accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mike |last=Wall |title=Dwarf Star Blasts out Stunningly Powerful Flares |url=http://www.space.com/21412-dwarf-star-flares-kepler-mission.html |work=[[Space.com]] |date=3 June 2013 |accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gizis-et-al"&gt;{{cite journal |first=John E. |last=Gizis |display-authors=etal |title=Kepler Monitoring of an L Dwarf II.

'''XDrawChem''' is a [[free software]] program for drawing chemical [[structural formula]]s, available for [[Unix]] and [[macOS]]. It is distributed under the [[GNU GPL]]. In [[Microsoft Windows]] this program is called WinDrawChem.

== Major features ==
* Fixed length and fixed angle drawing
* Automatic alignment of figures
* Detection of structures, text, and arrows, and their automatic placement
* Can automatically draw rings and other structures - has all standard [[amino acid]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s in a built-in library
* Retrieval of structures from a network database based on [[CAS number]], formula, or name
* Retrieval of information on a molecule based on a drawing
* Symbols such as [[partial charge]] and [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]]s
* Reading MDL Molfiles, CML ([[Chemical Markup Language]]), [[ChemDraw]] binary format, ChemDraw XML text format
* Writing MDL Molfiles, CML, [[ChemDraw]] XML text format
* Integration with [[OpenBabel]], allowing XDrawChem to read and write over 20 different [[chemical file format]]s.
* Image export in [[Portable Network Graphics]] (PNG), Windows bitmap, [[Encapsulated PostScript]] (EPS), and [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG)
* 3D structure generation with the help of the external program BUILD3D
* Simple spectra predictions, including 13C-NMR, 1H-NMR (based on additive rules and functional group lookup methods), and IR
* Simple property estimation, including pKa, octanol-water partition coefficient, and gas-phase [[enthalpy]] change.

'''Zénobe Théophile Gramme''' (4 April 1826 – 20 January 1901) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[electrical engineer]]. He was born at [[Jehay-Bodegnée]] on 4 April 1826, the sixth child of Mathieu-Joseph Gramme,&lt;ref name="hyperpaysagedejehay1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hyperpaysagedejehay.be/zenobe2.htm |title=Zénobe Gramme : un enfant du pays |publisher=Hyperpaysagedejehay.be |date=8 June 2008 |accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and died at [[Bois-Colombes]] on 20 January 1901. He invented the [[Gramme machine]], a type of [[direct current]] [[dynamo]] capable of generating smoother (less [[Alternating current|AC]]) and much higher voltages than the dynamos known to that point.

==Career==
Gramme was poorly educated and semi-literate throughout his life. His talent was in handicraft and when he left school became a joiner. After moving to Paris he took a job as a model maker at a company that manufactured electrical equipment and there became interested in technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/inventorbios/61/Z-nobe-Th-ophile-Gramme.html|title=Zénobe Théophile Gramme Biography (1826-1901)|publisher=How products are made|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having built an improved dynamo Gramme, in association with [[Hippolyte Fontaine]], opened a factory to develop the device. The business, called Société des Machines Magnéto-Électriques Gramme, manufactured the Gramme dynamo, Gramme ring, Gramme armature and other devices. In 1873 a Gramme dynamo was exhibited at the Vienna exhibition.

He was made an officer of the National Order of the [[Legion of Honour]] in 1877. In 1888 he was awarded the last of the valuable [[Volta Prize]]s by the French government.

==Gramme machine as motor==
In 1873 he and [[Hippolyte Fontaine]] accidentally discovered that the device was reversible&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212450/Hippolyte-Fontaine |title=Hippolyte Fontaine (French engineer) – Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would spin when connected to any DC power supply.  The Gramme machine was the first usefully powerful [[electrical motor]] that was successful industrially.  Before Gramme's inventions, electric motors attained only low power and were mainly used as toys or laboratory curiosities.

In 1875, [[Nikola Tesla]] observed a Gramme machine at the [[Graz University of Technology]]. He conceived the idea of using it for [[alternating current]] but was unable to develop the idea at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fi.edu/learn/case-files/tesla/seeds.html |title=Nikola Tesla: Planting Seends |publisher=Fi.edu |date= |accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
In 1857 he married Hortense Nysten who was a widow and mother of a daughter, Héloïse. Hortense died in 1890.&lt;ref name="hyperpaysagedejehay1"/&gt;

==Death and tributes==
Gramme died at [[Bois-Colombes]], France, on 20 January 1901 and was buried in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]].

In the city of [[Liège (city)|Liège]] there is a graduate school of engineering, l'[[Institut Gramme]], named after him.

In 2005 he ended at the 23rd place in the election of ''[[Le plus grand Belge]]'' (The Greatest Belgian), the television show broadcast by the [[French (language)|French]]-speaking [[RTBF]] and based on the [[BBC]] show [[100 Greatest Britons]].

A958 ''Zenobe Gramme'', (1961–), a sailing ship of the [[Belgian Navy]] used for training, is named after him.

== Honours ==
* Commander in the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]].
* Officer in the [[Legion of Honour]].
