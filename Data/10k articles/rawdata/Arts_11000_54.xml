'''Adventures in Preservation''', formerly named Heritage Conservation Network, is a [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to safeguarding the world’s architectural heritage. Its programs give volunteers from all walks of life the opportunity to be involved in preservation in a variety of hands-on ways.

== Overview ==

Adventures in Preservation (AiP) is a non-profit organization revolving around “Heritage Travel with Purpose”. AiP connects people and preservation through hands-on programs that safeguard cultural heritage and foster community sustainability. AiP travelers have the opportunity to travel, experience their destination, and learn hands-on skills from experts while assisting communities in a meaningful way.

AiP organizes a series of hands-on building conservation workshops and [[volunteer vacations]]. Working in locations around the world, participants support community-based preservation projects, such as restoring houses to create [[affordable housing]]. The workshops are meaningful opportunities to give back while learning about preservation in general, as well as specific building conservation techniques.

Each workshop is led by a technical expert, who teaches and guides volunteers as they work. Participation is open to all, from teens to active retirees. Since its founding in 2001, Adventures in Preservation has worked in a half-dozen countries, including Albania, Slovenia, Mexico, Italy, Ghana, and the United States. Many other projects are in development. Requests for assistance come directly from people involved at the [[Grassroots democracy|grass-roots]] level, and projects are put onto a wait list.

== Global impact and recognition ==
Numerous examples have shown that AiP’s volunteer efforts are a major catalyst for conservation. AiP volunteers have played a key role in restoration projects at the Francis Mill in [[Waynesville, North Carolina]]; the Weisel Bridge, [[Quakertown, Pennsylvania]]; [[Manor house|Manor House]] in Oplotnica, Slovenia; the gardens of [[Bartow-Pell Mansion|the Bartow-Pell Mansion]] Museum, [[The Bronx|The Bronx, New York]]; and adobe residences in [[Mesilla, New Mexico]].

They have also been involved in restoration efforts at the Jean (Jacob) Hasbrouck House, [[New Paltz (village), New York|New Paltz, New York]]; the Monastery of {{Interlanguage link multi|San Giovanni Battista, Serravalle|it|3=Chiesa di San Giovanni Battista (Vittorio Veneto)|lt=San Giovanni Battista}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Serravalle (Vittorio Veneto|it|3=Serravalle (Vittorio Veneto)|lt=Serravalle}}, [[Vittorio Veneto]], Italy; a [[shotgun house]] in Cairo, Illinois; the Chief’s House in Ablekuma, Ghana; and missions in [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua, Mexico]]. AiP also organized crews of volunteers in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], and [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi]], to help clean up in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

AiP volunteers restore more than buildings. They restore people's lives, their communities, and their pride in their heritage. The workshops also contribute variously to [[heritage tourism]], [[economic development]], and job training initiatives.

The organization and its volunteers have received awards for their efforts at Bartow-Pell Mansion Museum and their emergency stabilization work at the James Brown House and Farm Ooltehwah, Tennessee.

== Workshops ==
AiP adventures have always provided you a great educational experience, with hands-on training and excursions designed to highlight the essence of each country’s culture. AiP offers six to eight workshops each year. As with most [[volunteer travel]] programs, there is a fee for participating. This fee covers lodging, most meals, insurance, instructions, and a contribution towards the cost of conservation work and [[building material]]s. Current workshop offerings are listed on their website.

"Jammers" is a special term for the people who travel with AiP to explore and help restore the world's cultural heritage, because they are so much more than volunteers or participants. To make a long story short, "jammers" comes from an early misunderstanding that Adventures in Preservation worked with jam and jelly, as in strawberry and other fruit preserves. An interesting possibility, but not so. It represents the way a group of musicians, or other groups, come together to jam and create something new and wonderful.

The '''Agha Nour mosque''' ({{lang-fa|مسجد آقانور}}) is a [[mosque]] located in [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]]. It was founded during the [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas I]] era and completed during the [[Safi of Persia|Shah Safi]] era, and as such the names of the both kings were mentioned in the [[inscription]] above the [[portal (architecture)|portal]] of the mosque. The mosque was built under the supervision of Noureddin Mohammad Esfahani, who was one of the richest men in [[Isfahan]]. The [[Shabestan]] of this mosque is one of the most beautiful Shabestans in Isfahan. This Shabestan has stone [[Column|pillars]] with [[marble]] [[arch]]es, which provide light during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Hosseyn |last=Yaghoubi|title=Rāhnamā ye Safar be Ostān e Esfāhān |trans-title=Travel Guide for the Province Isfahan|publisher=Rouzane|isbn=964-334-218-2|editor-first=Beheshti |editor-last=Arash|page=105|language=Persian|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alfred-jewel-ashmolean.jpg|thumb|right|The Jewel viewed from the front, with the top in shadow]]
[[File:King Alfred’s Jewel—front, enamel, back.png|thumb|Front view; frame removed; back view]]
The '''Alfred Jewel''' is a piece of [[Anglo-Saxon art#Metalwork|Anglo-Saxon goldsmithing work]] made of enamel and quartz enclosed in gold.  It was discovered in 1693, in [[North Petherton]], [[Somerset]], England and is now one of the most popular exhibits at the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]].  It has been dated to the late 9th century, in the reign of [[Alfred the Great]] and is inscribed &lt;span style="text-transform:lowercase;font-variant:small-caps;"&gt;"AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN"&lt;/span&gt;, meaning 'Alfred ordered me made'. The jewel was once attached to a rod, probably of wood, at its base. After decades of scholarly discussion, it is now "generally accepted" that the jewel's function was to be the handle for a pointer stick for following words when reading a book.  It is an exceptional and unusual example of Anglo-Saxon jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, 154, quoted; Object&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function and commission ==
It seems to have been one of the precious 'æstels' or staffs that Alfred is recorded as having sent to each [[Episcopal see|bishopric]] along with a copy of his translation of [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]]'s book ''[[Pastoral Care]]'', saying in his preface to the book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And I will send a copy to every bishop's see in my kingdom, and in each book there is an aestel of 50 mancusses and I command, in God's name, that no man take the staff from the book, nor the book from the church.&lt;ref&gt;quoted, for example, in John Earle, ''The Alfred Jewel, an historical essay'', 1901:34; Webster, 153-154&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[mancus]] was a term used in early medieval Europe to denote either a [[gold coin]], with a weight of gold of 4.25 grams (2.73 [[Pennyweight|dwt]]; equivalent to the Islamic [[dinar]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TGkz9NGFXIMC&amp;pg=PA327&amp;dq=manqush+coin#PPA327,M1 Grierson 2007, p.327]&lt;/ref&gt; and thus lighter than the Byzantine [[solidus (coin)|solidus]]), or a unit of account of thirty [[silver]] [[penny|pence]]. This made it worth about a month's wages for a skilled worker, such as a craftsman or a soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reynolds|first=Nigel|title=A month's wages in one mancus|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1510010/A-months-wages-in-one-mancus.html|publisher=The Telegraph|date=2 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No other context is given in the preface, but in the context of books, the [[Old English]] word 'æstel' can mean a "guide", "index", and also a "handle";&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qg5aAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Dictionary of the Anglo-Saxon Language], p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; so, it is concluded that it meant a small pointer. Other jewelled objects with a similar form have survived, all with empty sockets, such as a 9th-century example in gold and glass in the [[British Museum]], found in [[Bowleaze Cove]] in [[Dorset]] (see below), and the ''[[yad]]'' or "[[Torah]] pointer" remains in use in Jewish practice.&lt;ref&gt;Object; [[parchment]] is ritually unclean for observant Jews, and the use of the scroll handles and ''yad'' avoid the need to touch it.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[David M. Wilson]] sounded a note of caution as to the connection with Alfred, noting that "in a period when royal titles meant something, there is no royal title in the inscription".&lt;ref name="Wilson, 111"/&gt;  However the commissioning by Alfred and the function as a pointer handle are taken as firmly established by [[Leslie Webster (art historian)|Leslie Webster]] in her survey ''Anglo-Saxon Art'' of 2012,&lt;ref&gt;Webster, 154-156, and see Index&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the Ashmolean.&lt;ref name="Object"&gt;Object&lt;/ref&gt;  Other functions suggested have been as an ornament for a crown, or as a [[pendant]], though this would display the figure upside down.&lt;ref name="Object"/&gt;

== Description ==
[[Image:Alfred Jewel.jpg|thumb|250px|The Alfred Jewel on display in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, next to the Minster Lovell Jewel.]]
[[File:King Alfred’s Jewel, inscription.png|thumb|The inscription round the sides]]
The Alfred Jewel is about {{convert|2+1/2|in|cm}} long and is made of [[filigree]]d [[gold]], enclosing a highly polished tear-shaped piece of clear [[quartz]] 'rock crystal', beneath which is set a [[cloisonné enamel]] plaque, with an image of a man, perhaps [[Jesus|Christ]], with ecclesiastical symbols. The figure "closely resembles the figure of Sight in the [[Fuller Brooch]], but it is most commonly thought to represent Christ as Wisdom or [[Christ in Majesty]]", according to Wilson,&lt;ref name="Wilson, 111"&gt;Wilson, 111&lt;/ref&gt; although Webster considers a personification of "Sight" a likely identification, also comparing it to the Fuller Brooch.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, 154&lt;/ref&gt;  Around the sides of the crystal there is a rim at the top that holds the rock crystal in place, above an [[openwork]] inscription: &lt;span style="text-transform:lowercase;font-variant:small-caps;"&gt;"AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN"&lt;/span&gt;, meaning 'Alfred ordered me made'.

An animal head at the base has as its snout a hollow socket, like those found in the other examples, showing that it was intended to hold a thin rod or stick. The back is a flat gold plate engraved with an [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]]-like plant motif,&lt;ref name="Wilson, 111"/&gt; or [[Tree of Life]] according to Webster.  Like the back of other examples, it is "suitable for sliding smoothly across the surface of a page".&lt;ref&gt;Webster, 154-155&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of relatively large cells of enamel to create a figurative image is an innovation in Anglo-Saxon art, following Byzantine or Carolingian examples, as is the use of rock crystal as a "see-through" cover.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, 156&lt;/ref&gt;  The rock crystal piece may be recycled from a Roman object.&lt;ref name="Object"/&gt;

== Later history ==
[[File:Alfred Jewel right way up.jpg|thumb|250px|19th-century illustration&lt;!-- (reversed; was upside down in the original) --&gt;]]
The jewel was discovered in 1693 at [[Petherton Park]], [[North Petherton]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Somerset]], on land owned by Sir Thomas Wroth (''[[circa]]'' 1675–1721). North Petherton is about {{convert|8|mi|km}} away from [[Athelney]], where King Alfred founded a monastery. A description of the Alfred Jewel was first published in 1698, in the [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]. It was bequeathed to [[Oxford University]] by Colonel Nathaniel Palmer (c. 1661-1718) and today is in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. There is a replica of the jewel in the [[Church of St Mary, North Petherton]]. Another replica is on display in the [[Blake Museum]], Bridgwater. In February 2015 the jewel returned to Somerset for the first time in 297 years when it was displayed for a month in the [[Museum of Somerset]], [[Taunton Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BBC|title=Alfred Jewel shown in 'home county' of Somerset|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-31064615|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar jewels ==

Since the discovery of the Alfred Jewel, six similar objects have been found. All are smaller and less elaborate, but are traceable to the same period and have a socket like that on the Alfred Jewel, suggesting that they were made for the same purpose.

''The Minster Lovell Jewel''&amp;nbsp;– the most similar to the Alfred Jewel, consisting of a round gold disk that contains an enamel plaque of a floral design. It was found in [[Minster Lovell]] in [[Oxfordshire]] and is kept at the Ashmolean Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/amps/leeds/AS_Oxfordshire/minster_lovell/minster_lovell_index.html |title=A picture is available here |publisher=Ashmolean.org |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Warminster Jewel''&amp;nbsp;– consists of filigreed gold strips containing a white glass stone. A small blue glass stone is held in the middle of the jewel where the gold strips meet. This jewel was discovered in [[Warminster]] in [[Wiltshire]] and is held in the Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warminster Jewel|url=http://www.salisburymuseum.org.uk/collections/romans-saxons/warminster-jewel.html|publisher=Salisbury &amp; South Wiltshire Museum|accessdate=25 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231043036/http://www.salisburymuseum.org.uk/collections/romans-saxons/warminster-jewel.html|archivedate=31 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Bowleaze Jewel''&amp;nbsp;– made of patterned gold with a blue glass stone in the middle. It was found at [[Bowleaze Cove]] near [[Weymouth, Dorset]] and is now in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artfund.org/artwork/4347/the-bowleaze-jewel |title=A picture is available here |publisher=Artfund.org |date=2012-07-19 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Yorkshire Aestel'' - resembles a golden animal's head with blue glass eyes, one of which is missing. It was found in [[Aughton, South Yorkshire|Aughton]], [[Yorkshire]], by Tim Pearson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/south_yorkshire/7621995.stm | work=BBC News | title=Saxon relic worth up to £15,000 | date=17 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was sold as "lot 312" in Bonhams Antiquities auction, Wednesday 15 October 2008 for ₤10,800.&lt;ref name="Bonhams"&gt;[http://www.bonhams.com/cgi-bin/public.sh/pubweb/publicSite.r?sContinent=EUR&amp;screen=ResultDescPrint&amp;iSaleNo=15941 Bonhams] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224081708/http://www.bonhams.com/cgi-bin/public.sh/pubweb/publicSite.r?sContinent=EUR&amp;screen=ResultDescPrint&amp;iSaleNo=15941 |date=2012-02-24 }} auction results&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/the-yorkshire-aestel--one-of-the-original-knowledge-gizmos-to-go-under-the-hammer/10031/ |title=A picture is available here |publisher=Gizmag.com |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the only privately owned aestel.

''The Borg Aestel''&amp;nbsp;– decorated with a pattern of spirals of gold wire. It was found in the ruins of a [[Viking Era]] Chieftain Hall at [[Borg, Vestvågøy|Borg]] in the [[Lofoten Islands]] in [[Norway]], and is now in the [[Lofotr Viking Museum]]. Alfred is known to have been visited by a powerful trader called [[Ohthere of Hålogaland|Ottar]], who was native to the Lofoten Islands, so it is possible that Alfred gave him the jewel as a gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bibliobuffet.com/on-marking-books-columns-195/archive-index-on-marking-books/910-a-kings-ransom-for-a-bookmark-102608 | title=A King’s Ransom for a Bookmark | publisher=BiblioBuffet | accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, and perhaps more likely, it was Viking loot, like most Anglo-Saxon finds in Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, 155&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Bidford Bobble''&amp;nbsp;– the smallest of the jewels. Its round head is made of patterned gold with blue and red enamel pieces. It was found in [[Bidford-on-Avon]] in [[Warwickshire]] and now belongs to the Warwickshire Museum Service.

The seven jewels were exhibited together for the first time in [[Winchester]] Discovery Centre between February and May 2008, as the centrepiece of an exhibition of relics of Alfred the Great.

The [[Early English Text Society]], a [[text publication society]] founded in 1864 to publish Anglo-Saxon and medieval English texts, uses a modified representation of the Jewel as its emblem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Early English Text Society, present, past and future|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~eets/|publisher=Early English Text Society|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Susan Cooper]]'s ''[[The Dark is Rising]]'' (1973), one of the six Signs of the Light, the Sign of Fire, is based on the Jewel.

'''Alice Frances Taeffe''' (July 24, 1900 &amp;ndash; December 22, 1987), known professionally as '''Alice Terry''', was an American film actress and director. She began her career during the [[Silent film|silent film era]], appearing in thirty-nine films between 1916 and 1933. While Terry's trademark look was her blonde hair, she was actually a brunette, and put on her first blonde wig in ''Hearts Are Trumps'' (1920) to look different from [[Francelia Billington]], the other actress in the film. Terry played several different characters in the 1916 anti-war film ''[[Civilization (film)|Civilization]]'', co-directed by [[Thomas H. Ince]] and [[Reginald Barker]]. Alice wore the blonde wig again in her most acclaimed role as "Marguerite" in film ''[[The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (film)|The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]'' (1921), and kept the wig for any future roles. In 1925 her husband [[Rex Ingram (director)|Rex Ingram]] co-directed ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', filming parts of it in [[Italy]]. The two decided to move to the [[French Riviera]], where they set up a small studio in [[Nice]] and made several films on location in [[North Africa]], [[Spain]], and [[Italy]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and others. In 1933, Terry made her last film appearance in ''[[Baroud]]'', which she also co-directed with husband.

==Career==
Born Alice Frances Taaffe in [[Vincennes, Indiana]], she made her film debut in 1916 in ''Not My Sister'', opposite [[Bessie Barriscale]] and [[William Desmond Taylor]].
{{Hollywood1921}}
Terry started in films as an extra during her mid-teens. For two years she worked in cutting rooms at [[Famous Players-Lasky|Famous-Players-Lasky]]. This work would help her later on when she worked with her husband.

Alice Terry was married to [[Rex Ingram (director)|Rex Ingram]], a prominent [[Film director|director]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rex Ingram|url = https://www.tcd.ie/film/rexingram/|website = www.tcd.ie|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of her biggest problems in her career was being the leading lady in movies directed by her husband. Her roles in films directed by her husband left her passive and unmemorable.&lt;ref name="SlideP48"&gt;Slide, Anthony; ''Silent Topics: Essays on Undocumented Areas of Silent Film''; p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rex Ingram (director)|Rex Ingram]] also hired male stars that further outshone her in movies such as ''[[The Conquering Power]]'' (1921), ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda (1922 film)|The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' (1922) and others.&lt;ref name="SlideP48" /&gt; One fan magazine writer described Alice as "pliant clay" or easily manipulated on screen.

In 1924 and 1925 the marriage between Terry and [[Rex Ingram (director)|Ingram]] was in jeopardy, and in that time period she worked under other directors. During this time period Alice worked on five movies, but her roles particularly in ''[[Any Woman]]'' (1925) and ''[[Sackcloth and Scarlet]]'' (1925), both by [[Paramount Pictures]], proved that Alice was a legitimate star away from her husband.&lt;ref name="SlideP48" /&gt; When they got back together, Terry took on a more behind-the-scenes role.

Alice's work at [[Famous Players-Lasky|Famous-Players-Lasky]] helped her in ways that were not commonly known to the public. [[Rex Ingram (director)|Ingram]] would often get too moody to work while directing movies so Terry would take over.&lt;ref name="SlideP48" /&gt; She was a competent [[Film editing|film editor]] and learned how to [[Film director|direct]] from a master. When [[Rex Ingram (director)|Ingram]] went to produce his last film, and only talkie, ''Baroud'' (1933), Alice helped so much that she was named co-director and she directed all the scenes [[Rex Ingram (director)|Ingram]] appeared in.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Baroud highlighted Alice's ability as an all around filmmaker but she never took that further.

Terry worked with [[Ramon Novarro|Ramón Novarro]], a popular a film star from [[Mexico]] who drew in audiences as a "[[Latin lover (stereotype)|Latin lover]]", and became known as a sex symbol after the death of Rudolph Valentino. Many have said that [[Ramon Novarro|Novarro]] outdid Terry in many films such as ''The Prisoner of Zenda'' (1922), ''The Arab'' (1924) and others; but this didn't hinder their friendship.

==Personal life==
In 1921, she married director [[Rex Ingram (director)|Rex Ingram]] during production of ''The Prisoner of Zenda'' (1922), which he directed and in which she appeared as Princess Flavia. The couple sneaked away over one weekend, were married in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], and returned to work promptly the following Monday.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Alice Terry|url = https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0855935/bio|website = IMDb|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923 Terry and [[Rex Ingram (director)|Ingram]] decided to move to the [[French Riviera]]. They formed a small studio in [[Nice]] and made several films on location in [[North Africa]], [[Spain]], and [[Italy]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the making of ''The Arab'' (1924) in [[Tunisia]], they met a street child named Kada-Abd-el-Kader, whom they adopted upon learning that he was an [[orphan]]. Allegedly, el-Kader misrepresented his age to make himself seem younger to his adoptive parents.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kada-Abd-el-Kader|url = https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0434255/bio|website = IMDb|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alice Terry was known for being open minded and acted as a [[Beard (companion)|cover]] for [[Ramon Novarro|Ramón Novarro's]] sexuality. In the 1930s she went with [[Ramon Novarro|Novarro]], [[Barry Norton]], and other [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] actors to [[Hollywood]] nightspots to act as a cover, which received backlash in the magazine ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.&lt;ref name="SlideP48" /&gt;

When [[Rex Ingram (director)|Ingram]] decided to return to [[Los Angeles]] he asked Terry to find a home by a river. One night when Terry was drinking with friends she instructed the cab to pull over so she could throw up. When Terry was done, she looked up and saw a property in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]] on the [[Los Angeles River]] and decided that this was the place where her new home with [[Rex Ingram (director)|Rex]] would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Silent Players: A Biographical and Autobiographical Study of 100 Silent Film Actors and Actresses|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uznsDu6OHA0C|publisher = University Press of Kentucky|date = 2010-02-01|isbn = 0813137454|first = Anthony|last = Slide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Terry and [[Rex Ingram (director)|Ingram]] moved back to the [[United States]] they started having problems with their adopted son, Kada-Abd-el-Kader. He "began associating with fast women and fast cars throughout the San Fernando Valley." Terry and Ingram sent him back to Morocco "to finish school."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kada-Abd-el-Kader never went back to school, but he later became a tourist guide in [[Morocco]] and Algiers. El-Kader would always tell tourists that he was the adopted son of [[Rex Ingram (director)|Rex Ingram]] and Alice Terry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Terry and [[Rex Ingram (director)|Ingram]] retired in the 1930s and took up painting. When [[Rex Ingram (director)|Ingram]] died in 1950, Terry invited four of his mistresses to his funeral.&lt;ref name="SlideP48" /&gt; When Alice was asked how she could invite four of his mistresses to the post-funeral party said: "Who cares, I'm the only one that can call herself Mrs. Rex Ingram."&lt;ref name="SlideP48" /&gt;

After [[Rex Ingram (director)|Ingram]]'s death Terry's sister Edna moved into the property on Kelsey Street and controlled Alice's life. Alice had a lover named [[Gerald Fielding]] who wanted to move in with Alice but Edna forbade it.&lt;ref name="SlideP48" /&gt; It is speculated that Edna was jealous of Alice, Edna started as an extra as movies just like her sister, but then married a financial advisor and she stopped acting altogether.&lt;ref name="SlideP48" /&gt;

Terry was still active in the 1970s. She loved hosting Sunday afternoon parties and going out to dinner in extravagant, floor length [[Fur clothing|mink coats]].&lt;ref name="SlideP48" /&gt; She was proud of her appearance and wanted to make sure all other women were envious.

[[File:Rex Ingram &amp; Alice Terry - Mar 1922 Photoplay.jpg|thumb|170px|Terry with her husband, Rex Ingram. ''[[Photoplay]],'' March 1922.|right]]

==Death==
[[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]] put a stop to Terry's parties and fun and she eventually died in a [[Burbank, California|Burbank, California hospital]] on December 22, 1987. Her grave is located in the [[Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles|North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California]]. For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Alice Terry has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6628 Hollywood Blvd.

'''Art in Sierra Leone''' has a long and significant tradition of carving and ceremonial works like masks and cloth for initiation and protection. Although art styles are oftentimes ascribed to a single ethnic group (often the [[Mende people|Mende]]), the styles and processes are spread throughout the country and many artists move between the different ethnic groups in the country.{{sfn|Hart|1989|p=45}}{{sfn|Cromwell|1977|p=79}}

Art is often practiced by organized societies, whether the traditional [[Sande society|Sande]] and [[Poro]] societies or the more recent ''odelay'' societies of [[Freetown]], and express a range of spiritual and political meanings. Carving using wood, ivory, and stone has been prominent for many centuries and retains importance today. In addition, since the 1930s, Freetown has had a number of ''lanterns'' competitions where different groups construct large, decorative floats.

==Artistic societies and groups==

===Sande and Poro Societies===

{{main|Sande society|Poro}}
The Sande (female) and Poro (male) ceremonial societies have a long history of artistic construction in many different ethnic groups of Sierra Leone. Although most often affiliated with the [[Mende people|Mende]], these societies exist widely in the ethnic groups of Sierra Leone including in the [[Temne people|Temne]], the [[Kono people|Kono]], the [[Vai people|Vai]], and [[Bullom languages]] communities.{{sfn|Cromwell|1977|p=79}}

The Sande and Poro societies, which are primarily tasked with the initiation ceremonies for women and men to become a part of the community, produce an important range of artwork associated with the ceremony.{{sfn|Cromwell|1977|p=79}} One of the most prominent artistic forms associated with these societies are the helmet masks (called ''sowei'' in Mende and ''anawu'' in Temne) involved in the initiation rituals.{{sfn|Cromwell|1977|p=79}}

===Odelay societies===
[[File:Temne. Ode-Lay Mask Brooklyn Museum.jpg|thumb| Odelay mask by [[Temne people]]. [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]
Sierra Leone did not develop a significant artistic tradition of patriotic imagery during the struggle for independence and after. However, after the [[1992 Sierra Leonean coup d'état]], youth groups (''odelay societies'') formed and began engaging in high-profile art with patriotic themes.{{sfn|Opala|1994|p=198}} Prominent figures depicted were [[Bai Bureh]] or [[Joseph Cinqué|Sengbe Pieh]] in the lanterns and masks by the odelay societies in Freetown.{{sfn|Opala|1994|p=199}} In addition to historical heroes, the art often depicts National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) leaders and symbols (such as [[Valentine Strasser]] and [[Solomon Musa]]).{{sfn|Opala|1994|p=205}}

==Woodworking==
[[File:Apaf5.jpg|thumbnail|Wood figure of the Mende people]]
In general, there are clear regional differences in the wood carving techniques of the forest communities (the Mende, Vai, and Bullom) with smooth edges and intricate details. The savannah style (the Temne Limba, and Loko communities), in contrast, is defined by abstract styles with straight lines and bold contrasts.{{sfn|Hart|1989|p=45}}

Twin figures are prominent in Temne cultural practice and the wood carvings play a key role in the ceremonial life of the community. These figures of no more than a foot tall are created with a twin child passes away, and are used initially as a play partner for the living twin and as a ceremonial site for the mother.{{sfn|Lamp|2008|p=51}}

The twin figures are carved into a number of other ceremonial related wood, including staffs for religious initiation and healing.{{sfn|Lamp|2008|p=53}}  Associated with these figures is the construction of small-scale houses for the twin (called ''ka-bangka'' in Temne) which are spread throughout the area.{{sfn|Lamp|2008|p=51}} This use of twin figures is associated with wider spiritual powers that twins are claimed to possess in Temne beliefs.{{sfn|Lamp|2008|p=56}}

==Stone and ivory carving==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 2000.93.1 Figure of a Man Holding a Crocodile (2).jpg|thumbnail|Nomoli stone carving of a man holding a crocodile. ([[Brooklyn Museum]])]]
Ivory carvings have been produced by many of the ethnic groups in the current area of Sierra Leone and were a primary export to Portuguese traders when they first began the trade networks with the coastal communities.{{sfn|Cromwell|1977|p=79}} It was not until the 1950s that the stylistic connections between the ivory pieces and the large stone carvings which were discussed significantly by European sources earlier in that century.{{sfn|Lamp|1990|p=48}}

The ''nomoli'' or ''pomdo'' stone carvings of unclear origin have been discovered buried around southern Sierra Leone.  The figures were first described by Europeans in 1852 by missionary George Thompson who discovered a group of five of them on the site of a destroyed village.{{sfn|Fraser|1971|p=393}} The human figures, carved out of [[soapstone]], are found throughout a large area that was controlled primarily by the Temne until the Mende entered in the 1600s.{{sfn|Lamp|1983|p=219}} When asked about the statues by early explorers, the people in the region expressed the belief that they were the work of spiritual beings and that no one in the communities knew how to make such a figure.{{sfn|Lamp|1983|p=220}}{{sfn|Fraser|1971|p=393}}

The Mende believe the stones are the representations of the people who lived in the region before they came to the area and the Temne people have a ceremony around the stones where they treat them as former chiefs and kings of the region.{{sfn|Lamp|1983|p=220}}{{sfn|Lamp|1983|p=237}} African art curator Frederick Lamp believes that the stone carvings are a Temne tradition which was lost when the Mende invaded and displaced the communities which had existed there before that.{{sfn|Lamp|1983|p=230}}

==Cloth work==
[[File:Sierra Leonian - Ivory Pyx with Scenes from the Passion of Christ - Walters 71108 - View D.jpg|thumb|right|Ivory carving of approximate 1500s origin from Sierra Leone]]
Cloth arts are often used in many of the different groups in Sierra Leone to provide special types of protection. The cloth is provided with specific designs for spiritual protection for the wearer.{{sfn|Cromwell|1977|p=79}}

==Lanterns==
A prominent modern artistic expression involves the design and floating of ''lanterns'' down the river in [[Freetown]], the capital of the country.{{sfn|Oram|1998|p=50}} From 1961 until 1991, the Young Men's Muslim Association (YMMA) held competitions where various different civil groups would design large floats, often with lights inside or outside, in celebration of Ramadan.{{sfn|Oram|1998|p=50}} The lanterns are constructed out of wood, bamboo, wire, paper, rice and other materials and represent landmarks, animals, or supernatural beings.{{sfn|Oram|1998|p=52}}

The lantern festival began small in the 1930s when the businessman Daddy Maggay witnessed a Catholic lantern festival in the Gambia.{{sfn|Nunley|1985|p=45}} The small processions slowly grew, largely as a result of the reputation for good cooking by Maggay's wife (whose specialty was corn and couscous), and eventually became run by the YMMA.{{sfn|Nunley|1985|p=45}}

As the competition grew, violence occasionally broke out and the event grew larger and larger.{{sfn|Nunley|1985|p=45}} The events and lanterns often have political themes related to the issues in Sierra Leone at the time and are affiliated with various movements.{{sfn|Nunley|1985|p=45}} The regular holding of the lantern competition was ended in 1991 by the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war]], but irregular competitions still are held.{{sfn|Oram|1998|p=50}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21239">An '''auteur''' ({{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|t|ɜːr}}; {{IPA-fr|otœʁ|lang}}, {{lit.}} '[[author]]') is an artist, such as a [[film director]], who applies a highly centralized and subjective control to many aspects of a collaborative creative work; in other words, a person equivalent to an author of a novel or a play.{{sfn|Santas|2002|p=18}} The term is commonly referenced to [[filmmakers]] or directors with a recognizable style or thematic preoccupation.{{sfn|Min|Joo|Kwak|2003|p=85}}

Auteurism originated in the French [[film criticism]] of the late 1940s as a [[value system]]{{sfn|Caughie|2013|pp=22–34, 62–66}} that derives from the [[film criticism]] approach of [[André Bazin]] and [[Alexandre Astruc]]—dubbed '''auteur theory'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; by the American critic [[Andrew Sarris]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|author1=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Auteur theory|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/auteur-theory|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Andrew|last=Sarris|authorlink=Andrew Sarris|coauthors=|date=Winter 1962–1963|title=Notes on the Auteur Theory in 1962|journal=Film Culture|volume=27|issue=|pages=1–8|id=|url=https://dramaandfilm.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/files/2011/06/Sarris-Notes-on-the-Auteur-Theory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was invented to distinguish [[French New Wave]] filmmakers from [[studio system|studio-system]] directors that were part of the [[Hollywood]] establishment,{{sfn|Santas|2002|p=18}} and has since been applied to producers of [[popular music]] as well as to [[video games|video-game]] creators.

==Film==
{{see also|List of film auteurs}}

=== Origin ===
[[File:Truffaut-BeauSerge.jpg|thumb|Film director and critic [[François Truffaut]] in 1965]]

Even before the auteur theory was clearly defined, the director was considered to be the most important among the people working on a film. Early German film theorist [[Walter Julius Bloem]] credited this to film being an art for the masses, and the masses being accustomed to regard someone who gives the final product (in this case, the director) as an artist, and those who contribute before (i.e. screenwriters) as apprentices.{{sfn|Bloem|1924}} &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battaglia|first=James|date=May 2010|title=Everyone's a Critic: Film Criticism Through History and Into the Digital Age|url=http://digitalcommons.brockport.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&amp;context=honors|journal=Senior Honors Theses|volume=|pages=32|via=Digital Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[James Agee]], one of the most famous film critics of the 1940s, said that "The best films are personal ones, made by forceful directors."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Around the same time, the French film critics [[André Bazin]] and [[Roger Leenhardt]] became advocates for the theory that it is the director that brings the film to life and uses the film to express their thoughts and feelings about the subject matter as well as a worldview as an auteur. They emphasised that an auteur can use lighting, camerawork, staging and editing to add to their vision.{{sfn|Thompson|Bordwell|2010|pp=381–383}}

===Development of theory===
The French magazine ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'' was founded in 1951 and quickly became a focal point for discussion on the role of directors in cinema. In [[François Truffaut]]'s 1954 essay "Une certaine tendance du cinéma français" ("A certain tendency in French cinema"), he criticized the prevailing "Cinema of Quality" trend in French cinema, saying that filmmakers were being unadventurous by adapting literary classics into unimaginative films. Truffaut said that these films treated the director as only a ''metteur en scene'', a "stager" who simply adds the performers and pictures to an already completed script.{{sfn|Thompson|Bordwell|2010|p=382}} Truffaut coined the phrase ''La politique des auteurs'' ("The policy of the authors") to describe his view, in which he expressed a clear preference for directors who operated with autonomy, vision and a signature style. These discussions were part of the beginning of the [[French New Wave]] in cinema.

From 1960, with his first self-directed film ''[[The Bellboy]]'', [[Jerry Lewis]] was one of the earliest Hollywood studio-system actor-turned-directors to be critiqued as an auteur. His attention to both the business and creative sides of production: writing, directing, lighting, editing and art direction coincided with the rise of the auteur theory. He earned consistent praise by French critics in both ''[[Cahiers du Cinéma]]'' and ''[[Positif (magazine)|Positif]]''. His singular ''[[mis-en-scene]]'', and skill behind the camera, was aligned with [[Howard Hawks]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Satyajit Ray]]. [[Jean-Luc Godard]] said, “Jerry Lewis...is the only one in Hollywood doing something different, the only one who isn’t falling in with the established categories, the norms, the principles. ...Lewis is the only one today who’s making courageous films. He’s been able to do it because of his personal genius”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jim Hillier, ed.|title=Cahiers du Cinema 1960–1968 New Wave, New Cinema, Re-evalutating Hollywood (Godard in interview with Jacques Bontemps, Jean-Louis Comolli, Michel Delahaye, and Jean Narboni)|year=1987|page=295|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674090620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popularization and impact===
[[Andrew Sarris]] coined the phrase "auteur theory" to translate ''la politique des auteurs'' and is credited for popularizing it in the United States and English-speaking media. He first used the phrase in his 1962 essay ''Notes on the Auteur Theory'' in the journal ''[[Film Culture]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began applying its methods to Hollywood films, and expanded his thoughts in his book ''The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929–1968'' (1968). The impact of Sarris' work was that critical and public attention on each film focused less on its stars and more on the overall product.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

In the 1960s and the 1970s, the filmmaking industry was revitalized by a new generation of directors. Known as the [[New Hollywood]] era, these directors were given increased control over their projects.&lt;ref&gt;David A Cook, "Auteur Cinema and the film generation in 70s Hollywood", in The New American Cinema by Jon Lewis (ed), Duke University Press, New York, 1998, pp. 1–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;Stefan Kanfer, The Shock of Freedom in Films, Time Magazine, Dec 8, 1967, Accessed 25 April 2009, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844256-7,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Studios showed an increase willingness to let directors take risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schatz|1993|pp=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phase came to end in the 1980s, when high-profile financial failures like ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' prompted studios to reassert control.

=== Criticism ===
The auteur theory had detractors from the beginning. [[Pauline Kael]] was an early opponent and she debated it with Andrew Sarris in the pages of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and various film magazines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/movies/12powe.html A Survivor of Film Criticism’s Heroic Age]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.observer.com/node/44957 Pauline and Me: Farewell, My Lovely]&lt;/ref&gt; Kael opposed privileging the director and instead argued that a film should be seen a collaborative process. In her 1971 essay ''[[Raising Kane]]'' (1971), on [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', she points out how the film made extensive use of the distinctive talents of co-writer [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] and cinematographer [[Gregg Toland]].&lt;ref&gt;Kael, Pauline, "[[Raising Kane]]", ''The New Yorker'', February 20, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Corliss]] and [[David Kipen]] have argued that writing is more important to a film's success than the directing.&lt;ref&gt;Kipen,  David (2006). ''The Schreiber Theory: A Radical Rewrite of American Film History'', p.38. Melville House {{ISBN|0-9766583-3-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diane Garrett. "[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117930243.html?categoryid=1010&amp;cs=1 Book Review: The Schreiber Theory]." ''Variety'', April 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="corliss-obit"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/25/business/media/richard-corliss-71-longtime-film-critic-for-time-dies.html|title = Richard Corliss, 71, Longtime Film Critic for Time, Dies|last = Weber|first = Bruce|date = April 24, 2015|work = The New York Times|access-date = May 17, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2006 book, Kipen coined the term [[Schreiber theory]] to refer to the theory that the screenwriter is the principal author of a film.

Film historian [[Georges Sadoul]] pointed out that the main author of a film is not necessarily the director, but can be the main actor, screenwriter, producer, or even the author of the original story (in case of literary adaptations). Also, he argued that the film can only be seen as a work of collective and not as a work of a single person.{{sfn|Sadoul|1972}} Film historian [[Aljean Harmetz]], referring to the creative input of producers and studio executives in classical Hollywood, argues that the auteur theory "collapses against the reality of the studio system".&lt;ref&gt;Aljean Harmetz, ''Round up the Usual Suspects'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some criticize the auteur theory, and the practice of praising auteurs, for being male-dominated. Writing for ''[[IndieWire]]'' in 2013, Maria Giese noted that pantheons of auteur directors rarely included a single woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/12/auteur-directors-any-american-women-169108/|title=Auteur  Directors: Any American Women?|last=Giese|first=Maria|date=2013-12-09|work=IndieWire|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some point to the broader lack of women directors; the under-representation of [[women in film]] has been called the [[celluloid ceiling]]. In 2016, just 7% of all directors for the top 250 grossing movies were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/women-filmmakers-2016-statistics-show-female-directors-declined-number-963729|title=Study: Female Filmmakers Lost Ground in 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others point to the lack of women in film schools, which has since changed. Now, Professor Martha Lauzen of [[San Diego State University]] says that women are represented in film schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/31/female-film-makers|title=Why are there so few female film-makers?|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|date=2010-01-31|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
There are references in law,{{vague|reason=The law where?|date=August 2016}} where a directed film is treated as a work of art and the auteur, as the creator of the film, is the original [[copyright]] holder. Under [[European Union law]], the film director is considered the author or one of the authors of a film, largely as a result of the influence of auteur theory.{{sfn|Kamina|2002|p=153}}

== Popular music ==
[[File:Phil Spector.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Record producer [[Phil Spector]] in 1964]]

The references of auteur theory are occasionally applied to musicians, musical performers and music producers. From the 1960s, [[Phil Spector]] is considered the first auteur among producers of popular music.{{sfn|Eisenberg|2005|p=103}}{{sfn|Bannister|2007|p=38}} Author Matthew Bannister named him the first "star" producer.{{sfn|Bannister|2007|p=38}} Journalist [[Richard Williams (journalist)|Richard Williams]] wrote: "Spector created a new concept: the producer as overall director of the creative process, from beginning to end. He took control of everything, he picked the artists, wrote or chose the material, supervised the arrangements, told the singers how to phrase, masterminded all phases of the recording process with the most painful attention to detail, and released the result on his own label.".{{sfn|Williams|2003|pp=15–16}}{{sfn|Williams|2003|pp=15-16}}

Another early [[pop music]] auteur was [[the Beach Boys]]' multi-tasking leader [[Brian Wilson]],{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=890}} who himself was mentored by Spector.{{sfn|Cogan|Clark|2003|pp=32–33}} Before the [[progressive pop]] of the late 1960s, performers were typically unable to decide on the artistic content of their music.{{sfn|Willis|2014|p=217}} Wilson became the first rock producer to [[Recording studio as an instrument|use the studio as a discrete instrument]],{{sfn|Cogan|Clark|2003|pp=32–33}} thus making the Beach Boys one of the first rock groups to exert studio control.{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=193}} Music producers after the mid 1960s would draw on his influence, setting a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as producers, either autonomously, or in conjunction with other like minds.{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=890}} ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s Jason Guriel wrote that Wilson "paved the way for auteurs like [[Kanye West]] ... anticipat[ing] the rise of the producer ... [and] the modern pop-centric era, which privileges producer over artist and blurs the line between entertainment and art. ... Anytime a band or musician disappears into a studio to contrive an album-length mystery, the ghost of Wilson is hovering near."&lt;ref name="Guriel2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guriel|first1=Jason|title=How Pet Sounds Invented the Modern Pop Album|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/how-pet-sounds-invented-the-modern-pop-album/482940/|publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]''|date=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Video games ==
{{See also|Art game|Video games as an art form}}

In broadening the use of the terms associated with auteur theory, it has also been applied to the audio-visual environment as encountered in video games. Japanese developer [[Hideo Kojima]] (''[[Metal Gear]]'' series) is considered to be the first auteur of video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hideo Kojima - video gaming's first auteur - Screen Robot|url=http://screenrobot.com/hideo-kojima-video-gamings-first-auteur/|website=Screen Robot|accessdate=7 April 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other auters include [[Tetsuya Nomura]] (''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series), [[Fumito Ueda]] (''[[Ico]]'', ''[[Shadow of the Colossus]]'', ''[[The Last Guardian]]''), [[Jon Van Caneghem]] (''[[Might and Magic]]'' series), [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]] (''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-12-09-final-fantasy-xv-and-the-last-guardian-the-last-of-their-kind | title = Final Fantasy XV and The Last Guardian: The Last of their Kind | first = Rob | last = Fahey | date = 9 December 2016 | accessdate = 9 December 2016 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ragnar Tørnquist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the creator of Dreamfall got back to his roots - Polygon|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/4/25/4261002/the-longest-journey-of-ragnar-tornquist|accessdate=6 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Ronald "Bill" Reid Jr.''', [[Order of British Columbia|OBC]] ({{date|12 January 1920|dmy}} – {{date|13 March 1998|dmy}}) ([[Haida people|Haida]]) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] artist whose works include [[jewelry]], [[sculpture]], [[screen-printing]], and [[paintings]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/william-ronald-reid/ "Bill Reid"], ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his major works were featured on the [[Canadian twenty-dollar bill#Canadian Journey Series|Canadian $20 banknote]] of the [[Canadian Journey Series (banknotes)|Canadian Journey series]] (2004–2012).

==Biography==

===Early years===    
William Ronald Reid Jr., called Bill, was born in [[Victoria, British Columbia]]; his father was American William Ronald Reid Sr., of Scottish-German descent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/aborig/reid/reid02e.shtml Bill Reid], Can. Museum of Civilization&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother, Sophie Gladstone Reid, was from the Kaadaas gaah Kiiguwaay, Raven/Wolf [[Clan]] of T'anuu, more commonly known as the [[Haida people|Haida]], one of the [[First Nations]] of the Pacific coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theravenscall.ca/en/who/life_story |title=Who was Bill Reid? |author=Bill Reid Foundation |year=2010 |work=The Raven's Call |publisher=virtualmuseum.ca |accessdate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reid developed a keen interest in Haida art while working as a radio announcer in [[Toronto]] for [[CBC Radio]], where he also studied jewelry making at the [[Ryerson Institute of Technology]]. His maternal grandfather first taught Reid about Haida art, and through him, Bill inherited his tools from his great-great-uncle [[Charles Edenshaw]], a renowned artist who died the year Reid was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Christie|title=Raven's Cry|date=1966|publisher=McClelland and Stewart|location=Toronto|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Robin K.|last2=Ginson|first2=Mandy|editor1-last=Wright|editor1-first=Robin K.|editor2-last=Augaitis|editor2-first=Daina|title=Charles Edenshaw|date=2013|publisher=Black Dog Publishing|location=London|isbn=9781908966209|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Reid returned to [[Vancouver]], where he eventually established a studio on [[Granville Island]]. He became greatly interested in the works of Edenshaw, working to understand the [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] of his work, much of which had been lost along with many Haida traditions. During this time Reid also worked on salvaging artifacts, including many intricately carved [[totem pole]]s, which were then moldering in abandoned village sites. He assisted in the partial reconstruction of a Haida village in the [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC|University of British Columbia Museum of Anthropology]].

At the age of 29, Reid married a woman named Mabel. They had one child together and later adopted a second.

Working in the traditional forms and modern media (usually [[gold]], [[silver]] and [[Haida argillite carvings|argillite]]), Reid began by making jewelry. He gradually explored larger sculptures in [[bronze]], [[Western red cedar|red cedar]] and [[Callitropsis nootkatensis|Nootka Cypress]] (yellow cedar), usually portraying figures, animals, and scenes from [[folklore]]. He intended to express his ancestors' visual traditions into a contemporary form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moa.ubc.ca/exhibits/online_sourcebooks.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127134833/http://moa.ubc.ca/exhibits/online_sourcebooks.php |archivedate=2012-01-27 |df= }}, Museum of Anthropology&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major works and awards===
Reid's most popular works are three large bronze sculptures. Two depict a [[canoe]] filled with human and animal figures: one black, ''The [[Spirit of Haida Gwaii]]'', is at the [[Canadian Embassy, Washington, D.C.]], in the United States; and one green, ''The Jade Canoe'', is at [[Vancouver International Airport]], in [[British Columbia]]. The third sculpture, ''Chief of the Undersea World'', depicts a breaching [[orca]] and is installed at the [[Vancouver Aquarium]]. [[Plaster cast]]s of these sculptures are held by the [[Canadian Museum of History]] in [[Gatineau]], Canada.

==Legacy and honours==
Reid received many honours in his life, including honorary degrees from the [[University of British Columbia]], the [[University of Toronto]], the [[University of Victoria]], the [[University of Western Ontario]], [[York University]], and [[Trent University]]. He received the [[Indspire Awards|National Aboriginal Achievement Award]], the Indspire Awards, for Lifetime Achievement in 1994, and was made a member of the [[Order of British Columbia]] and an Officer of [[France]]'s [[Order of Arts and Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/1998/1998-06-27/pdf/g1-13226.pdf ''Canada Gazette'' Part I, Vol. 132, No. 26] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522232342/http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/1998/1998-06-27/pdf/g1-13226.pdf |date=2013-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was made a member of the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]].&lt;ref name=RCA1880&gt;{{cite web|title=Members since 1880 |url=http://www.rca-arc.ca/en/about_members/since1880.asp |publisher=Royal Canadian Academy of Arts |accessdate=11 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526215339/http://www.rca-arc.ca/en/about_members/since1880.asp |archivedate=26 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 1996 Canada Post issued 'The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, 1986-1991, Bill Reid' in the Masterpieces of Canadian art series. The stamp was designed by [[Pierre-Yves Pelletier]] based on the sculpture ''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii'' (1991) by William Ronald Reid in the Canadian Embassy, Washington, United States. The 90¢ stamps are perforated 12.5 x 13 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s1=%28art.TITP.%29+Or+%28art.TITI.+And+null.B742.%29&amp;l=20&amp;d=STMP&amp;p=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2Farchivianet%2F02011702_e.html&amp;r=12&amp;f=G&amp;Sect1=STMP |title=Canada Post stamp |access-date=2018-11-07 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130101051500/http://data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s1=(art.TITP.)+Or+(art.TITI.+And+null.B742.)&amp;l=20&amp;d=STMP&amp;p=1&amp;u=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/archivianet/02011702_e.html&amp;r=12&amp;f=G&amp;Sect1=STMP |archive-date=2013-01-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of his sculptures, ''Raven and the First Men'' and ''[[Spirit of Haida Gwaii]]'', are prominently featured on the [[Canadian twenty-dollar bill|$20 note]] in the [[Bank of Canada]]'s new ''Canadian Journey'' (2004) issue, paired with a quotation from author [[Gabrielle Roy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bank-banque-canada.ca/en/banknotes/general/character/2001-04_20.html $20- 2001-2004 Series, ''Canadian Journey''- Bank note series, 1935 to present- Bank Notes- Bank of Canada&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
Reid participated in the blockades of logging roads which helped save the rain forests of [[Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site|Gwaii Haanas (South Moresby)]]. He stopped work on the sculpture in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] during this period to protest the destruction of the forests of [[Haida Gwaii]], by the time Bill Reid was alive the archipelago was called the Queen Charlotte Islands. In 1981, he married Martine de Widerspach-Thor (Mormanne), a French anthropologist.

Having dedicated the later part of his life to the creation of new works and these tasks of [[curator|curation]], Reid died on 13 March 1998, of [[Parkinson's disease]], in Vancouver. In July 1998 friends and relatives paddled Lootaas, a large cedar canoe carved by Reid for [[Expo 86]], on a two-day journey along the Pacific coast to bring his ashes to Tanu Island in [[Haida Gwaii]], the site of his [[New Clew, British Columbia|mother's village]] of New Clew.

The '''Birds Mosaic''' is a mosaic floor that was discovered in [[Caesarea]], [[Israel]].

==Discovery==
[[File:Caesarea-Maritima-2-234.jpg|200px|thumb|right|General view of the mosaic. In the middle are cisterns.]]
The mosaic was discovered in 1950 during a military exercise, and after five years was covered in sand to prevent deterioration. Archaeologist [[Shmuel Yeivin]] was the first to publish about it, and described it as a church due to the apse located in the east of the building. Since no pillars were found, he proposed that the church was without a roof. But in 1985 archaeologist [[Ronny Reich]] concluded that the site was the central part of a villa, rather than a church.

In 2004, the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] removed the 70 cm thick dirt layer covering the mosaic, restored and strengthened it, and prepared it for visitors. The site was opened to the public in October 2005. Entrance to the site is free, and it is possible to walk on the mosaic.

==The site==

The mosaic floor belongs to a [[Byzantine]] palace that was built in the end of the 6th century or beginning of the 7th century, and which lay outside the walls of [[Caesarea Maritima|ancient Caesarea]]. The floor covered the central courtyard of the palace, which was led to by a portico on the west side. Surrounding it was a colonnade, rooms, and additional courtyards with mosaic floors. The built area of the palace was about 1500 square meters, and the entire settlement covered about 3 [[dunam]]s. It belonged to a wealthy Christian family, but no indications of its identity have been found. The building had an additional story which also had mosaic floors, parts of which collapsed when the palace was destroyed by fire, apparently during the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] in 640. The wooden beams of the second floor were burned, and parts of its mosaic were found on the floor of the first story.
===The mosaic===
The mosaic takes up an area of 16 by 14.5 meters. It includes a frame decorated with fruit trees bearing large and beautiful fruit. Between the trees are large mammals in states of movement. The mammals include lions, leopards, bears, ibex, dogs, elephants, gazelle, oxen, wild boar, horse, and goat.

The center of the mosaic (surrounded by the frame) consists of 120 round medallions populated by large colorful birds, which give the mosaic its name. The medallions form 12 rows, with different kinds of birds in each row - [[peacocks]], [[storks]], [[pelicans]], [[herons]], [[pheasants]], grey-headed [[swamphen]], [[duck]], [[flamingo]], [[guineafowl]], [[ostrich]], [[rock partridge]] - all of them facing to the left. The sequence of birds is such that the same species is repeated along a diagonal in the medallion array.

Under the mosaic is a plastered cistern, to which drained rainwater from the entire complex. In the northwest corner of the site was a reservoir which received its water from a well. The complex was too high to receive water from Caesarea's aqueduct, so it needed an independent water supply.

===Table===
Another, unique, finding at the site was a table cover in the shape of the letter D, tiled with squares and triangles. The table was made with the "glass-gold" method - two layers of glass with a gold layer between it, and figures of crosses and flowers in the gold layer. When the palace was burned, the table overturned and was burned, while the cover was preserved on the floor. This cover was removed from the site for preservation.

The '''Saint Petersburg Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre''' (The Big Stone Theatre of Saint Petersburg, {{lang-ru|Большой Каменный Театр}}) was a [[Theater (structure)|theatre]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].

It was built in 1783 to [[Antonio Rinaldi (architect)|Antonio Rinaldi]]'s Neoclassical design as the Kamenny (i.e., Stone) Theatre; [[Giovanni Paisiello]]’s opera ''Il mondo della luna'' was performed at the opening on 24 September.&lt;ref name=mariinsky&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=28 December 2016  |url=https://www.mariinsky.ru/en/about/history/mariinsky_theatre/
|title=Mariinsky Theatre: History of the Theatre
|publisher=Mariinsky Theatre |year=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was rebuilt in 1802 according to the designs of the architect [[Thomas de Thomon]] and renamed the Bolshoi, but burned down in 1811.&lt;ref name=mariinsky/&gt; The building was restored in 1818, and modified between 1826 and 1836 by [[Alberto Cavos]] to accommodate more modern machinery.&lt;ref name=mariinsky/&gt;

Until 1886, the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre was principal theatre for both the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]] and the Imperial Russian Opera. It was there that the first Russian operas — [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]]'s ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'' and ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' — were premiered. Although the theatre would include many of the great Russian operas in its repertory, many of the works of Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, and Rimsky-Korsakov received their world premieres on the stage of the [[Imperial Mariinsky Theatre]].  Many of the great 19th century ballets of [[Marius Petipa]] and [[Arthur Saint-Léon]] were given for the first time on the stage of the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre.

In 1886 the building was declared unsafe and, at the behest of the theatre director [[Ivan Vsevolozhsky]], the [[ballet]] and [[opera]] performances moved to the [[Imperial Mariinsky Theatre]], where they have remained ever since. The Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre was then torn down to make place for the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]]. The only surviving sections of the original theatre are the grand staircase and landing, preserved in the building of the conservatory.

==Reception==
In their 2014 book ''Beyond Bibliometrics: Harnessing Multidimensional Indicators of Scholarly Impact'', [[Blaise Cronin]] and Cassidy R. Sugimoto noted that "for impact assessment of book-based fields, bibliometricians need a database with large numbers of books" and that while the Book Citation Index did meet this need, [[Google Books]] also fulfilled this purpose and was not only free, but was (at the time) more comprehensive for bibliometric analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cronin|first1=Blaise|last2=Sugimoto|first2=Cassidy R.|title=Beyond Bibliometrics: Harnessing Multidimensional Indicators of Scholarly Impact|date=2014|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262323291|pages=33, 289, 296|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxSaAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA296&amp;dq=%22Book+Citation+Index%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ig9sVZ2QB4rLsASwyYHYBw&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Book%20Citation%20Index%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 article in the ''[[Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology]]'' remarked on the index's opportunities and limitations. It stated that the "most significant limitations to this potential application are the high share of publications without address information, the inflation of publication counts, the lack of cumulative citation counts from different hierarchical levels, and inconsistency in citation counts between the cited reference search and the book citation index."&lt;ref name=journal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorraiz|first1=Juan|last2=Purnell|first2=Philip J.|last3=Glänze|first3=Wolfgang|title=Opportunities for and limitations of the Book Citation Index|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|date=July 2013|volume=64|issue=7|pages=1388–1398|doi=10.1002/asi.22875|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.22875/full|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also stated that the Book Citation Index was "a first step toward creating a reliable and necessary citation data source for monographs — a very challenging issue, because, unlike journals and conference proceedings, books have specific requirements, and several problems emerge not only in the context of subject classification, but also in their role as cited publications and in citing publications."&lt;ref name=journal /&gt;

'''Book signing''' is the affixing of a [[signature]] to the [[title page]] or flyleaf of a [[book]] by its [[author]].  '''Book signings''' are events, usually at a [[bookstore]] or [[library]], where an author sits and signs books for a period.

==Book signing==
Book signing is popular because an author's signature increases the value of books for [[book collecting|collectors]]. The author may add a short message to the reader, called a [[dedication]], to each book, which may be personalized with the recipient's name upon request.  A simple author's signature without a dedication is typically more valuable to collectors (exceptions include inscriptions to persons of note, e.g., from [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]] to [[F. Scott Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald]], or to persons of significance in the author's life).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Sometimes an author will sign additional copies for future sale. An additional advantage to authors for doing this is that once a book has been signed, it cannot be returned to the publisher for a refund.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Many authors today spend a great deal of time signing their books, and sign many thousands of copies.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} For example, [[John Green (author)|John Green]] signed all 150,000 copies of the first printing of his 2012 novel ''[[The Fault in Our Stars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-authors/article/47821-ya-author-john-green-to-sign-all-first-editions-of-next-novel.html|title = YA Author John Green to Sign All First Editions of Next Novel|website = [[Publishers Weekly]]|date = June 29, 2011|accessdate = June 27, 2017|last = Kirch|first=Claire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing popularity of ebooks and ereading devices has inspired the development of software - such as Authorgraph (formerly known as Kindlegraph and renamed to reflect its expansion to include all ereading platforms)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work=GoodEreader.com| title=Feature: Authorgraph Allows Authors to Digitally Sign eBooks |author=Kozlowski, Michael |accessdate=May 12, 2014| url=http://goodereader.com/blog/interviews/feature-authorgraph-allows-authors-to-digitally-sign-ebooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Autography (for [[iOS]] devices) - that allows authors to digitally personalize ebooks, by including autographs, dedications, and photographs, and to provide such personalization remotely as well as at in-person book signings. Such software benefits authors, "who are not obliged to go on long distance promotional tours in order to autograph e-books for their fans",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://portables.about.com/od/ebookreasers/a/E-Book-Autograph.htm |work=About.com Portable Electronics|accessdate=May 12, 2014 |title=Autography Lets Authors Sign Your E-Book Without Vandalizing Your E-Reader|author=Moon, Brad|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as those readers who are unwilling or unable to brave crowds and longs lines at onsite book signings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=May 12, 2014|title=Live Online Ebook Signing via Spreecast Tonight|author=Pilkington, Mercy |work=GoodEreader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before such applications were introduced, efforts to bridge the [[digital divide]] for those who read ebooks included having authors sign the backs of their fan's ereading devices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times| title=Would You Sign My Kindle? |author=Rosenbloom, Stephanie| date= April 13, 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/fashion/14NOTICED.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sign ebooks via direct stylus input (e.g., on a [[Sony Reader|Sony Reader Touch]] or [[Palm OS|Palm eReader]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://portables.about.com/od/ebookreasers/a/E-Book-Autograph.htm |work=About.com Portable Electronics|accessdate=May 12, 2014 |title=Autography Lets Authors Sign Your E-Book Without Vandalizing Your E-Reader|author=Moon, Brad|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book signings==
Book signings provide more than a just a chance to obtain signatures.  Authors and bookstores are benefited by the fact that many copies of the book being promoted are sold at these events.  Signings also increase public goodwill and allow authors to connect with their fans.  For fans, signings provide a chance to see and meet a favorite author and ask them questions.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The development of social media platforms allows modern day authors to conduct virtual book signings. For example, The GoodEReader and Autography jointly hosted an ebook signing with author HP Mallory, during which Mallory greeted fans via [[Spreecast]], a social connectivity platform that allows users to have up to four guests on [[video chat]] at one time,  to conduct Q&amp;A sessions with even more participants, and to maintain a channel on the site, thereby recording and storing the Spreecast and assigning the recordings a URL for sharing at other outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Online Ebook Signing via Spreecast Tonight| author=Pilkington, Mercy | work=GoodEreader.com|accessdate=May 12, 2014|url=http://goodereader.com/blog/electronic-readers/live-online-ebook-signing-via-spreecast-tonight}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many authors use the book signing platform LiveSigning to host large-scale, streaming video book signings with their fans. Donald Trump hosted a book signing on this platform during his presidential campaign in December 2015. Book signings on LiveSigning typically consist of the author signing books, answering questions from fans, and making phone calls to some fans. After the event, the signed books are mailed to everyone who purchased a signed copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Donald Trump Sells Out of His Own Signature at $13 a Copy| author=Frizell, Sam | work=Time.com|accessdate=August 19, 2016|url=http://time.com/4145029/donald-trump-signed-book/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the indicators of the strength of a [[brand]] in the hearts and minds of customers, '''brand preference''' represents which brands are preferred under assumptions of equality in price and availability.

== Purpose ==

Measures of brand preference attempt to quantify the impact of [[marketing]] activities in the hearts and minds of customers and potential customers. Higher brand preference usually indicates more revenues (sales) and profit, also making it an indicator of company financial performance.

== Construction ==
There are at least three classes of methodologies to measure brand preference directly: 
* [[Statistical survey|Survey]] questions (self-report, unaided preference)
* Brand choice measures (choice of preferred brand from a competitive set of brands)
* Constant sum measures (planned purchases amongst a competitive set of brands)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2967">'''Craig and Madill''' was a Toronto based architectural formed by James Henry Craig (1888-1954) and Henry Harrison Madill (1889-1988).

The firms work spanned from 1912 to mid 1950s with all located in [[Toronto]], but both architects built buildings on their own during that time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/1628&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm's work stopped from 1915 to 1918 when both served overseas during [[World War I]] and ended in 1954 with the death of Craig.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/2132&lt;/ref&gt;

==James Henry Craig==

Craig was a fellow architecture student with Madill at the [[University of Toronto]] and worked his entire career with Madill after 1912, but had independent commissions from 1920s to 1950s with most outside of Toronto (exception was the [[Dominion Public Building]] which Craig worked with [[Thomas W. Fuller]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/1628&lt;/ref&gt; He married [[Grace Morris Craig|Grace MacFarlane Morris]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cwahi.concordia.ca/sources/artists/displayArtist.php?ID_artist=791 |title=Craig, Grace Morris |work=Canadian Women Artists History Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Henry Harrison Madill==

Madill was born in [[Beaverton, Ontario]], but later moved to Toronto where he graduated from [[Jarvis Collegiate]] and enrolled in architecture at the [[University of Toronto]], where he met Craig. With Craig he served with the [[Canadian Army]] from 1915 to 1918, but returned to practice after the war. Madill worked at the School of architecture at the University of Toronto from 1920 to 1975 (Dean from 1948 to 1957 and Director Emeritus in 1975).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/2132&lt;/ref&gt; Madill's academic work prevailed over his design work after Craig's death.

* [[The Palace Pier]] 1930 and destroyed by fire in 1963

'''''Cry Freedom''''' is a 1987 British-South African epic drama film directed by [[Richard Attenborough]], set in late-1970s  [[apartheid]] era [[South Africa]]. The screenplay was written by [[John Briley]] based on a pair of books by journalist [[Donald Woods]]. The film centres on the real-life events involving black activist [[Steve Biko]] and his friend Donald Woods, who initially finds him destructive, and attempts to understand his way of life. [[Denzel Washington]] stars as Biko, while actor [[Kevin Kline]] portrays Woods. ''Cry Freedom'' delves into the ideas of discrimination, political corruption, and the repercussions of violence.

The film was primarily shot on location in [[Zimbabwe]] and in [[Kenya]] due to political turmoil in South Africa at the time of production. As a film showing mostly in limited cinematic release, it was nominated for multiple awards, including Academy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song. It also won a number of awards including those from the Berlin International Film Festival and the British Academy Film Awards.

A joint collective effort to commit to the film's production was made by [[Universal Pictures]] and Marble Arch Productions. It was commercially distributed by Universal Pictures cinematically, and by [[MCA Home Video]] for home media. ''Cry Freedom'' premiered in cinemas nationwide in the United States on 6 November 1987 grossing $5,899,797 in domestic ticket receipts. The film was at its widest release showing in 479 cinemas nationwide. It was generally met with positive critical reviews before its initial screening in cinemas.

South African authorities unexpectedly allowed the film to be screened in cinemas without cuts or restrictions, despite the publication of Biko's writings being banned at the time of its release.&lt;ref name="nyTimesCryFreedom"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/28/world/pretoria-censors-to-let-cry-freedom-be-seen.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Following a news story depicting the demolition of a slum in [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]], [[South Africa]], liberal journalist [[Donald Woods]] (Kevin Kline) seeks more information about the incident and ventures off to meet black activist [[Steve Biko]] (Denzel Washington). Biko has been officially [[banning order|''banned'']] by the [[South African government]] and is not permitted to leave his defined banning area at [[King William's Town]]. Woods is formally against Biko's banning, but remains critical of his political views. Biko invites Woods to visit a black township to see the impoverished conditions and to witness the effect of the government-imposed restrictions, which make up the apartheid system. Woods begins to agree with Biko's desire for a South Africa where blacks have the same opportunities and freedoms as those enjoyed by the white population. As Woods comes to understand Biko's point of view, a friendship slowly develops between them.

After speaking at a gathering of black South Africans outside of his banishment zone, Biko is arrested and interrogated by South African security forces. Following this, he is brought to court in order to explain his message directed toward the South African government. After he speaks eloquently in court and advocates non-violence, the security officers who interrogated him visit his church and vandalize the property. Woods assures Biko that he will meet with a government official to discuss the matter. Woods then meets with [[Jimmy Kruger]] ([[John Thaw]]), the South African Minister of Justice in his house in [[Pretoria]] in an attempt to prevent further abuse by the security force. Kruger first expresses discontent over the actions of security force, however Woods is later harassed by security forces at his home. The security men that harass Woods insinuate that their orders to visit Woods came directly from Kruger.

Later, Biko decides to travel to Cape Town to speak at a student-run meeting. En route, security forces stop his car and arrest him. He is held in harsh conditions and beaten, causing a severe brain injury. A doctor recommends consulting a nearby specialist in order to best treat his injuries, but the police refuse out of fear that he might escape. The security forces instead decide to take him to a police hospital in Pretoria, around 700 miles (1&amp;nbsp;020&amp;nbsp;km) away from Cape Town. He is thrown into the back of a prison van and driven on a bumpy road, aggravating his brain injury and resulting in his death.

Woods then works to expose the police's complicity in Biko's death. He attempts to expose photographs of Biko's body that contradict police reports that he died of a hunger strike, but he is prevented just before boarding a plane to leave and informed that he is now banned, therefore not able to leave the country. Woods and his family are targeted in a campaign of harassment by the security police. He later decides to seek asylum in England to expose the corrupt and racist nature of the South African authorities. After a long trek, Woods is eventually able to escape to the Kingdom of [[Lesotho]], disguised as a priest. His wife Wendy ([[Penelope Wilton]]) and their family later join him. With the aid of Australian journalist [[Bruce Haigh]] ([[John Hargreaves (actor)|John Hargreaves]]), the [[British High Commission]] in Maseru, and the [[Government of Lesotho]], they are flown under [[United Nations Laissez-Passer|United Nations passports]] and with one Lesotho official over South African territory, via [[Botswana]] to [[London]], where they were granted [[political asylum]].

The film's epilogue displays a graphic detailing a long list of anti-apartheid activists (including Biko), who died under suspicious circumstances while imprisoned by the government.

===Development===
[[File:South Africa racial map, 1979.gif|thumb|right|350px|Racial-demographic map of South Africa in the late 1970s.]]
The premise of ''Cry Freedom'' is based on the true story of [[Steve Biko]], the charismatic South African [[Black Consciousness Movement]] leader who attempts to bring awareness to the injustice of [[Apartheid]]; and [[Donald Woods]], the [[Liberalism in South Africa|liberal]] white editor of the ''[[Daily Dispatch]]'' newspaper who struggles to do the same after Biko is murdered. In 1972, Biko was one of the founders of the [[Black People's Convention]] working on social upliftment projects around Durban.&lt;ref name=aboutAfrican&gt;{{cite web |url=http://africanhistory.about.com/od/stevebiko/a/bio-Biko.htm |title=Stephen Bantu (Steve) Biko |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BPC brought together almost 70 different black consciousness groups and associations, such as the South African Student's Movement (SASM), which played a significant role in the 1976 uprisings, and the Black Workers Project which supported black workers whose unions were not recognized under the Apartheid regime.&lt;ref name="aboutAfrican" /&gt; Biko's political activities eventually drew the attention of the South African government which often harassed, arrested, and detained him. These situations resulted in his being banned in 1973.&lt;ref name="SouthAfricanHistory" /&gt; The banning restricted Biko from talking to more than one person at a time, in an attempt to suppress the rising anti-apartheid political movement. Following a violation of his banning, Biko was arrested and later killed while in police custody.

Rita Kempley, writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', said actor Washington gave a "zealous, Oscar-caliber performance as this African messiah, who was recognized as one of South Africa's major political voices when he was only 25."&lt;ref&gt;Kempley, Rita (6 November 1987).

He saw director Attenborough's aims as "more academic and political than dramatic". Overall, he expressed his disappointment by exclaiming, "In a country busier than Chile with oppression, violence and subjugation, the story of Woods' slow awakening is certainly not the most exciting, or revealing."&lt;ref name="howe"&gt;Howe, Desson (6 November 1987).

But on a negative front, he noted how the film "promises to be an honest account of the turmoil in South Africa but turns into a routine cliff-hanger about the editor's flight across the border. It's sort of a liberal yuppie version of that [[Night Crossing|Disney movie]] where the brave East German family builds a hot-air balloon and floats to freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Roger (6 November 1987).

[[Janet Maslin]] writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' saw the film as "bewildering at some points and ineffectual at others" but pointed out that "it isn't dull. Its frankly grandiose style is transporting in its way, as is the story itself, even in this watered-down form." She also complimented the African scenery, noting that "''Cry Freedom'' can also be admired for Ronnie Taylor's picturesque cinematography".&lt;ref name="maslin"/&gt; The ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety Staff]]'', felt Washington did "a remarkable job of transforming himself into the articulate and mesmerizing black nationalist leader, whose refusal to keep silent led to his death in police custody and a subsequent coverup." On Kline's performance, they noticed how his "low-key screen presence served him well in his portrayal of the strong-willed but even-tempered journalist."&lt;ref&gt;Variety Staff (1 January 1987).

Mark Salisbury of ''[[Time Out (magazine)|TimeOut]]'' boasted on the film's merits by declaring the lead acting to be "excellent" and the crowd scenes "astonishing", while equally observing how the climax was "truly nerve-wracking".

'''''Cymon and Iphigenia''''' is an oil on canvas painting by [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton]]. The painting does not bear a date but was first exhibited at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], London, in 1884. The [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] in [[Sydney]], Australia, purchased it at a [[Christie's]] auction in London in 1976.{{TOC LIMIT|2}}

==Background==
According to a story published in 1897, Leighton spent six months searching throughout Europe for a model to match his imagined ideal of [[Iphigenia]] for his intended portrayal of Cymon and Iphigenia. He saw a young actress, [[Dorothy Dene]], in a theatre in London and his search was over.{{r|Inquirer}} Possessing a classical Greek style beauty, Dene had golden wavy hair with excellent skin texture and colouration on her face; she was taller than average with graceful arms and legs together with an “exquisitely moulded bust”.{{r|Inquirer}} She appeared in several other of Leighton's works, including ''Greek Girls Playing Ball'' and ''Summer Moon''.{{r|Inquirer}} Lena, one of Dene's younger sisters, appears in the painting as the child slave.{{r|Artmagick}} Other paintings by Leighton featuring Dene are: ''The Bath of Psyche'', ''Clytie'', ''Perseus and Andromeda'', ''Solitude'', ''The Return of Persephone'' and ''The Vestal.''{{r|Artmagick}}

The painting took eight months to complete;{{r|Inquirer}} a succession of line drawings were done first as Leighton tried to capture the position he wanted for the central figure,{{r|Nahum}} around 56 – including several of foliage and other elements of the piece – of these are known to exist.{{r|Kensington}} The English art critic [[Peter Nahum]] describes the painting as "central among Leighton's later works",{{r|Nahum}} an opinion Mrs Russell Barrington considered was shared by Leighton.{{sfnp|Barrington|1906|p=258|ps=none}} Leighton's painting ''Idyll'' dating from a few years earlier has some similar elements but lacks the complexities of ''Cymon and Iphigenia''.{{sfnp|Mallais|Tadema|1886|p=16|ps=none}} The two compositions each highlight the difference between the fair complexion of a female with a dark skinned male; both feature a full-length woman reclining beneath a tree and similar lighting techniques are used.{{sfnp|Mallais|Tadema|1886|p=16|ps=none}}

==Description==
The overall dimensions of the undated oil on canvas painting are {{convert|163|by|328|cm}}.{{r|AGNSW}} Based on [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s{{r|Times}} ''[[The Decameron]]'', the painting depicts a scene from the first tale of day five; Iphigenia is sleeping in the woods and Cymon, a young nobleman,  stands gazing at her beauty which fills him with inspiration.{{sfnp|Ruvoldt|2004|p=99|ps=none}} After seeing her, Cymon changes from a badly mannered lout to an ideal [[polymath]].{{sfnp|Ruvoldt|2004|p=101|ps=none}} Nahum felt it "emphasised the transforming power of beauty."{{r|Nahum}} Boccaccio set the story in the springtime; Leighton preferred the ambience of a more autumnal feel.{{sfnp|Rhys|1900|p=45|ps=none}} The artist was very precise about the mood he wanted to reflect by describing the specific setting of the time of day as "the most mysteriously beautiful in the whole twenty-four hours".{{sfnp|Barrington|1906|p=258|ps=none}} He wished to capture the overall impression of drowsiness just before drifting to sleep especially on long hot days as night begins to fall.{{sfnp|Rhys|1900|p=45|ps=none}} The painting is set when there is the "merest lip of the moon" showing on the horizon above the sea and the atmosphere is "haunted still with the flush of the after-glow from the sun already hidden in the west."{{sfnp|Barrington|1906|p=258|ps=none}}

Iphigenia lies with her face and torso pivoted slightly to her right, her arms are raised above her head.{{r|Nahum}} Her body is loosely covered by material{{sfnp|Rhys|1900|p=45|ps=none}} and the depiction of her figure is described as "masterly" by a writer using the name of "Mentezuma" in his report included in the [[Art Amateur]] about the Royal Academy exhibition of 1884.{{sfnp|Mentezuma|1884|p=51|ps=none}} Other sleeping figures are Iphigenia's servants{{sfnp|Rhys|1900|p=45|ps=none}} and a dog.{{sfnp|Mentezuma|1884|p=51|ps=none}} According to Greenhough White, Leighton had the ability to show "the perfection of repose" and the "self-abandonment and unconsciousness of sleep" and it was utilised to full effect in this painting and his earlier work entitled ''Summer Moon''.{{sfnp|White|1899|p=477|ps=none}}

==Exhibitions and provenance==
The first time the painting was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] was at the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition|summer exhibition]] in 1884.{{r|AGNSW}} After viewing it at the exhibition an unnamed French critic reported that he could not recall "a more original effect of light and colour, used in the broad, true, and ideal treatment of lovely forms."{{sfnp|Rhys|1900|p=45|ps=none}} The following year, in 1885, it was exhibited in Berlin.{{sfnp|Barrington|1906|p=258|ps=none}} It was again displayed at the Royal Academy in the winter of 1897, a memorial exhibition of his works as Leighton had died on 25 January 1896.{{r|Timeline}}  It was included in the [[Guildhall Art Gallery]]'s annual loan exhibition in 1897.{{r|AGNSW}} [[William Quilter|Sir W.E. Cuthbert Quilter]] owned the painting until it was sold among his art collection in July 1909.{{r|AGNSW}} It changed ownership a number of times in the UK, with owners including [[Albu Baronets|Leopold Albu]], and Pamela Cavendish (mother of [[Hugh Cavendish, Baron Cavendish of Furness]]), before being purchased at auction by the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Australia, in February 1976.{{r|AGNSW}}  It returned to at the Royal Academy from mid-February to April 1996, in an exhibition devoted to the work of Leighton.{{r|AGNSW}} The Art Gallery of New South Wales also purchased a colour study of the painting, measuring {{convert|23.5|by|46.5|cm}}, in 1986.{{r|Colour study}}

'''''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-and-Rock 'N Roll Generation Saved Hollywood''''' is a book written by [[Peter Biskind]] and published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 1998. ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'' is about the [[New Hollywood|1970s Hollywood]], a period of American film known for the production of such films such as ''[[The Godfather]],'' ''[[The Godfather Part II]],'' ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]],'' ''[[Taxi Driver]],'' ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]],'' ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]],'' ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]],'' and ''[[The Last Picture Show]]''. The title is taken from films which bookend the era: ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) and ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980).

==Controversy and criticism==
Several of the film-makers profiled in the book have criticized Biskind. Robert Altman denounced both the book and Biskind's methods, saying "It was hate mail. We were all lured into talking to this guy because people thought he was a straight guy but he was filling a commission from the publisher for a hatchet job. He's the worst kind of human being I know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Full exposure | author = Tim Adams | work = [[The Observer]] | date = 22 August 2004 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/aug/22/film1 | archivedate = 2013-12-03 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203134613/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/aug/22/film1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Ford Coppola was similarly critical, alleging that Biskind interviewed only people with negative opinions of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=‘Easy Riders, Raging Bulls’ Author Peter Biskind Looks Back at the New Hollywood |author=Susan Wloszczyna |work=[[IndieWire]] |date=July 18, 2014 |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2014/07/easy-riders-raging-bulls-author-peter-biskind-looks-back-at-the-new-hollywood-191482/ |accessdate=August 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Roger Ebert]] noted that Steven Spielberg said of ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'' that: "Every single word in that book about me is either erroneous or a lie."&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite web| title=TINSELTOWN AUTHOR GETS 'DOWN AND DIRTY,' INDEED |author=[[Roger Ebert]] |work=Rogerebert.com |date=February 22, 2004 |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/tinseltown-author-gets-down-and-dirty-indeed |accessdate=August 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert himself notes that: "Biskind has a way of massaging his stories to suit his agenda."&lt;ref name="Ebert"/&gt; When asked about Biskind's portrayal of him as "a womanizer, a tyrant and a bully," William Friedkin said: "I've actually never read the book, but I've talked to some of my friends who are portrayed in it, and we all share the opinion that it is partial truth, partial myth and partial out-and-out lies by mostly rejected girlfriends and wives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Exorcist Director William Friedkin Tells All in His No-Bullshit Memoir |author=Paul Teetor |work=[[LA Weekly]] |date=April 11, 2013 |url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/the-exorcist-director-william-friedkin-tells-all-in-his-no-bullshit-memoir-4184306 |accessdate=August 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Bogdanovich was equally furious, saying: "I spent seven hours with that guy over a period of days, and he got it all wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bogdanovich Epilogue: A Word About Biskind And Cher |author=David Poland |work=Movie City News |date=February 14, 2006 |url=http://moviecitynews.com/2006/02/bogdanovich-epilogue-a-word-about-biskind-and-cher/ |accessdate=August 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forerunner of this work was the ''Handwörterbuch des deutschen Märchens'' (''Handbook of German Fairy Tales''), of which only two volumes were published.&lt;ref&gt;The first fascicle of volume 1 was published in 1930. The two completed volumes were: {{Cite book |editor= Mackensen, Lutz |year=1933 |title= Handwörterbuch des deutschen Märchens, Volume 1: Aarnes Märchentypensystem - Exotische Vögel |publisher= De Gruyter |location= Berlin |oclc= 163503036}} and {{Cite book |editor= Mackensen, Lutz |year=1940 |title= Handwörterbuch des deutschen Märchens, Volume 2: Fabel - Gyges |publisher= De Gruyter |location= Berlin |oclc= 163503041}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wittman"&gt;{{Cite news |author= Wittman, Angela |date= 26 December 2005 |title= Was die Zwerge nicht wussten (What the dwarves did not know) |newspaper= [[Die Zeit]] |language= German |url= http://www.zeit.de/2005/52/C-M_8archen |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6RYfD9SSn?url=http://www.zeit.de/2005/52/C-M_8archen |archivedate= 3 August 2014 |deadurl= no |df=  }} (article on the making of the ''Enzyklopädie des Märchens'')&lt;/ref&gt;

The first article ''Aarne, Antti Amatus'' appeared in slip in 1975, and the first volume in 1977. By 2014, the final fourteenth volume had been published, followed by an additional volume with lists, indexes and corrigenda in 2015.

==Creation and compilation==
The project was begun by [[Kurt Ranke]] in the early 1960s with a small staff, and the first fascicle appeared in 1975. Ranke was not only the founder but first chief editor of the project; he was succeeded by [[Rolf Wilhelm Brednich]], who completed the project. Other editors included [[Elfriede Moser-Rath]] (1963-1987),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |author=Tomkowiak, Ingrid |year=1997 |title=Moser-Rath, Elfriede |encyclopedia=Neue Deutsche Biographie |volume=18 |pages=184&amp;ndash;185 |publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot, Berlin |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-428-00199-6 |url=http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz65750.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RYotLOIs?url=http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz65750.html |archivedate=3 August 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Lüthi]] (1973-1984), Rudolf Schenda (1973-1992), [[Lutz Rohrich]] (1973-2006), and Regina Bendix (2005-2006). Technical editors included Doris Boden, Ulrich Marzolph, Ulrike-Christine Sander, and Christine Shojaei Kawan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=''Enzyklopädie des Märchens'' |language=German |publisher=De Gruyter |url=http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~enzmaer/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RYm93xef?url=http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~enzmaer/ |archivedate=3 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 18th century, ideas of aesthetic pleasure have tried to define "taste". [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[David Hume|Hume]] both argued that there was universal good taste, which made aesthetic pleasure. A feminist line of logic about these attempts is that, because [[fine art]] was a leisure activity at this time, those who could afford to make art or produce supposed universal truths about how it is enjoyed would do so in a way that creates class and sex division.&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt; Even when those universal aesthetists did address gender, they categorized aesthetics into two categories: [[beauty]] and [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublimity]]; with beauty being small and delicate (feminine) and sublimity being large and awe-inspiring (masculine).&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt; Feminist aesthetics analyzes why "feminine" traits are subservient compared to "masculine" traits in art and aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender and Aesthetics: An Introduction|last=Korsmeyer|first=Carolyn|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9780415266581|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation for the male-domination of forming aesthetic theory is that feminists express their aesthetic pleasure differently than non-feminist aesthetes for "whom the pleasure of theorizing [...] is a form of [[jouissance]]". Instead, a feminist is less likely to view the object as a disinterested interpreter, and intellectualize the sensation (Hilde Hein).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Critics of feminist art argue that politics have no place in art, however, many art forms contain politics, but because of their subject position, the critics are unable to perceive it. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aesthetics in Feminist Perspective|last=Hein|first=Hilde|last2=Korsmeyer|first2=Carolyn|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=Bloomington|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the ''creative genius'' is inspected in feminist aesthetics. In particular, women artists are often excluded from being creative or artistic geniuses.&lt;ref name=":0" group="encycl"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Genius and Feminism|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aesthetics|publisher=Oxford University Press|last=Battersby|first=Christine|date=1998|editor-last=Kelly|editor-first=Michael|isbn=9780195113075}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exclusion in part stems from the traditional masculine definitions of genius.&lt;ref name=":0" group="encycl" /&gt; Christine Battersby has critiqued the fact that women are excluded from being known as geniuses because female artists will be separated from their art, and instead their art will be called genius, instead of the artist.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, women were also excluded because they lacked the opportunities for artistic education required to be recognized as artists and geniuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender and Aesthetics: An Introduction|last=Korsmeyer|first=Carolyn|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=2004|isbn=9780203646632|series=Understanding Feminist Philosophy|location=London|pages=59|chapter=Amateurs and Professionals}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the idea of the creative genius itself celebrates individualism – which Christine Battersby calls "a kind of masculine heroism" – and overlooks the work of joint collaborations.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender and Genius: Towards a Feminist Aesthetics|last = Battersby|first = Christine|publisher = The Women's Press Ltd.|year = 1989|isbn = 978-0704343009|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic theories that make a distinction between "arts" and "crafts" can be viewed as anti-feminist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Differencing the Canon: Feminism and the Writing of Art's Histories|last=Pollock|first=Griselda|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=9780415066990|location=New York|pages=25|chapter=Differencing: Feminism's encounter with the canon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, art usually refers to ''fine art'' and crafts refers to everything else which has ''[[Everyday Aesthetics|everyday aesthetics]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Art forms traditionally used by women, such as embroidery or sewing, are perceived as crafts and not art, because of their domestic uses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Feminist aesthetics focuses on all objects created by women, whether or not they are seen as "art".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Since those craft practices occur in the home where many women continue to work, their creativity is overlooked by the perception of "art", because their domain is marginalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Extraordinary in the Ordinary: The aesthetics of everyday life|last = Leddy|first = Thomas|publisher = Broadview Press|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gonfalonier''' (in Italian: ''Gonfaloniere'') was the holder of a highly prestigious [[Medieval commune|communal]] office in [[Italy in the Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]], notably in [[Florence]] and the [[Papal States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Archivio delle Tratte: Introduzione e inventario | publisher=Rome: Archivio di Stato di Firenze |author1=Viti, Paolo  |author2=Zaccaria, Raffaella Maria | year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name derives from ''[[gonfalone]]'' (in English, gonfalon), the term used for the banners of such communes.

In Florence, the office was known as [[Gonfalonier of Justice]] (''Gonfaloniere di Giustizia'') and was held by one of the nine citizens selected by the drawing lots every two months, who formed the city's government, or [[Signoria of Florence|Signoria]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In the papal states, it was known as [[Gonfalonier of the Church]] or Papal Gonfalonier.&lt;ref name="BritannicaGonfalonier"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/238447/gonfalonier | title=Gonfalonier: Medieval Italian Official | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica | date=23 November 2014 | accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other central and northern Italian communes, from [[Spoleto]] to the [[County of Savoy]], elected or appointed ''gonfalonieri.''  The [[House of Bentivoglio|Bentivoglio family]] of [[Bologna]] aspired to this office during the sixteenth century.  However, by the year 1622, when [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] painted a portrait of [[Pietro Gentile]] as a gonfaloniere of [[Bologna]], with the ''gonfalone'' in the background, the office had merely symbolic value.

He was educated at [[Dulwich College]] and [[Oxford University]] where he read [[Greats]] (classics). In 1959 he became a classics teacher at [[Tonbridge School]]. In 1963 he left his teaching post to study for a diploma in the history of European art at the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], which he passed with distinction. In 1966 he was appointed a full-time assistant lecturer at the Courtauld, where he taught until his retirement.&lt;ref name=Higgott&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Higgott|first1=Gordon|title=John Newman: An Appreciation|journal=Architectural History|date=2001|volume=44|page=1|doi=10.2307/1568726}} [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/architectural-history/article/john-newman-an-appreciation/62D22BC0CF6FBBE1693FCE8B293BB2F2 ''abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kauffmann|first1=Michael|title=John Newman at the Courtauld Institute|journal=Architectural History|date=2001|volume=44|page=5|doi=10.2307/1568727}} [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/architectural-history/article/john-newman-at-the-courtauld-institute/70B7D640F7CD45E39AC078C82F149B60# ''abstract'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Newman|2001|p=cover}}

While a student at the Courtauld, Newman acted as driver to [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] for five weeks in Hampshire. Pevsner suggested that Newman should research and write the architectural guides on Kent, which were published in 1969.&lt;ref name=Higgott/&gt; Newman worked with Pevsner on ''The Buildings of England'' series,{{sfn|Newman|2001|p=cover}} which has been expanded as the ''[[Pevsner Architectural Guides]]'' to cover Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Since 1983, Newman has acted as the advisory editor to the series.{{sfn|Newman|2001|p=cover}} Bridget Cherry, the general editor of the series, and author of a history of the project, describes Newman as the most significant of Pevsner's collaborators,{{sfn|Cherry|1983|p=8}} and Pevsner himself considered Newman's two volumes on [[Kent]] to be "the best of the whole series".{{sfn|Cherry|1983|p=8}}

From 1975 to 1985 Newman was honorary editor of the journal ''[[Architectural History (journal)|Architectural History]]''.&lt;ref name=Higgott/&gt; He has served on the executive committee of the Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sahgb.org.uk/uploads/1/9/5/2/1952873/7.pdf |title=Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 Newman chaired the Pevsner Memorial Trust, which undertook the restoration of the [[murals]] at the [[Church of St Michael and All Angels, Garton on the Wolds|Church of St Michael and All Angels]], [[Garton on the Wolds]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] in memory of Sir Nikolaus.{{sfn|Bradley|Cherry|2001|p=76}}

'''Jules Girardet''' (10 April 1856, [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] - 25 January 1938, [[Boulogne-Billancourt]]) was a French painter and illustrator of Swiss descent.

==Biography==
He came from a Swiss [[Huguenot]] family. His father was the engraver Paul Girardet (1821-1893).

He studied at the [[École des Beaux-arts]] and in the studios of [[Alexandre Cabanel]]. After several trips to North Africa with his brother [[Eugène Girardet|Eugène]], a noted [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] painter, he chose instead to concentrate on [[Genre art|genre]] scenes and [[history painting]].&lt;ref name="S"&gt;[http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F22410.php] Dictionnaire Historique de la Suisse&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Paris Commune|Commune]] and [[Louise Michel]] were favorite topics.

He married in 1881 and built a house with a studio in Boulogne-Billancourt. That same year, he began to exhibit at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]]. He won a Silver Medal at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)]].&lt;ref name="S" /&gt; In addition to his paintings, he illustrated several books, including ''Mademoiselle de Fierlys'' by Frédéric Dillaye (who died in the infamous fire at the [[Bazar de la Charité]]) and ''[[Tartarin de Tarascon]]'' by [[Alphonse Daudet]]. His brother {{ill|Léon Girardet|fr}} was also a painter.

'''Julie Catherine Berry''' (born December 15, 1980) is an [[Americans|American]] [[television personality]] and [[TV producer|producer]].  She is best known for competing on the reality competition show ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'',  as well as her subsequent relationship with its host, [[Jeff Probst]].

==Early life==
Julie was born on December 15, 1980, in [[Lewiston, Maine]]. A [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] from the [[Maliseet]] tribe, she was later adopted at the age of four by Les Berry, an engineer, and his wife Judith, an adoption lawyer. As a result of the adoption, Julie Berry gained an older brother, Chris, but she also was separated from her biological sister, whom she would not see again for another two decades.&lt;ref name=pressherald&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ricks|first1=Selena|title=Maine woman to compete on 'Survivor'|work=Portland Press Herald|publisher=Blethen Maine Newspapers Inc.|date=August 18, 2004|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berry grew up in [[Gorham, Maine]], where she attended [[Gorham High School (Maine)|Gorham High School]].&lt;ref name=aj&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowell |first1=Robert |title=Gorham: Crowley, Berry: Where are they now? |url=http://www.keepmecurrent.com/american_journal/gorham-crowley-berry-where-are-they-now/article_fab96cfa-b91c-11e4-bdb7-275c22123833.html |website=Keep Me Current: American Journal |publisher=Keep Me Current |access-date=December 3, 2015 |date=February 20, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709164507/http://www.keepmecurrent.com/american_journal/gorham-crowley-berry-where-are-they-now/article_fab96cfa-b91c-11e4-bdb7-275c22123833.html |archivedate=July 9, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There, she played soccer and softball, and also took a physics class taught by [[Robert Crowley (Survivor contestant)|Bob Crowley]], the eventual winner of ''[[Survivor: Gabon]]''.&lt;ref name=pressherald /&gt;&lt;ref name=aj /&gt; After high school, she attended [[East Carolina University]], earning her [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in family and community development. Her junior year of college was spent at [[California State University, Northridge]] (CSUN), as part of a [[student exchange]] program.&lt;ref name=pressherald /&gt; She would later return to CSUN for her [[Master of Science]] degree in educational psychology and counseling. In December 2003, she was accepted into the [[Peace Corps]], although she ultimately did not join.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Admin1|last1=(admin)|title=Julie Berry on Television's "Survivor" - In December, 2003, Berry was accepted into the Peace Corps but did not serve|url=http://peacecorpsonline.org/messages/messages/2629/2023154.html|website=Peace Corps Online|publisher=Peace Corps Online|access-date=December 3, 2015|date=August 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Survivor''==
In 2004, Berry was one of 18 people selected for the cast of ''[[Survivor: Vanuatu]]'', the series' ninth season overall. Upon meeting the series' host, [[Jeff Probst]], for the first time during a casting interview, Probst knew at first sight that he definitely wanted her on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nepales|first1=Ruben|title=Jeff Probst has survived and seen ’em all|url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20080309-123615/Jeff-Probst-has-survived-and-seen-em-all|access-date=December 6, 2015|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=March 9, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309195805/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20080309-123615/Jeff-Probst-has-survived-and-seen-em-all|archivedate=March 9, 2008|location=Internet Archive: Wayback Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the start of the game, she was initially placed in the Yasur tribe, an all-female group.  On Day 11, she was one of only two women switched to the previously all-male Lopevi tribe (the other being Twila Tanner). After the merge, Berry and Tanner pondered between sticking with their Lopevi alliance or returning to their old all-female Yasur alliance.  Ultimately, they chose to re-align with the women.  At the Final Five reward challenge, Berry won the reward: a picnic lunch.  She chose [[Chris Daugherty]] to enjoy the reward with her, hoping that he would join her in eliminating Tanner.  In the end, Daugherty ended up siding with Tanner, and Berry was voted out, giving her a fifth-place finish overall and making her the fifth member of the jury.

At the Final Tribal Council, Berry wept openly before proceeding to ask Daugherty if their friendship had been real or not.  She followed that up with a make-or-break question to determine which finalist would get her vote.  Ultimately, she voted for Daugherty over Tanner for the title of Sole Survivor.

==Personal life==
Following production of ''Survivor: Vanuatu'', the show's host, [[Jeff Probst]], sent Berry an [[e-mail]] just to say hello.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Cynthia|title=Jeff Probst Admits to Survivor Romance|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1007913,00.html|access-date=December 3, 2015|work=People|publisher=Time Inc.|date=December 15, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly thereafter, the two were dating.  Their relationship was not made public until the live airing of the ''Vanuatu'' reunion show when, as the closing credits rolled, Probst began holding Berry’s hand in front of the studio and viewing audience.  In an interview with ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine, Probst expressed his gratitude for Berry, saying, "I finally met someone who could teach me about love...Julie's given me a sense of balance I've never had. It's like fingers interlacing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wulff|first1=Jennifer|title=A Lasting Alliance|work=People|issue=Vol. 64, No. 16|publisher=Time, Inc.|date=October 17, 2005|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two were together for three years.  By 2008, they were no longer dating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keck|first1=Will|title=Celeb Watch: 'Survivor' host Jeff Probst will survive -- and thrive; see video|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/celebwatch/2008-04-27-jeff-probst_N.htm|accessdate=December 4, 2015|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Co. Inc.|date=April 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

==Other accomplishments==
In 2017, Berry and her travel partner Kasey Stewart set a [[Guinness World Record]] for "fastest time to travel to all seven [[continent]]s." They set the record with a time of three days, 20 hours, four minutes, and 19 seconds.&lt;ref name=pressherald2 /&gt;

[[Image:A chorus line.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Broadway musical]] ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' was lit using conventional lighting instruments.]]
[[Image:Classical spectacular10.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Lighting at the 2005 Classical Spectacular Concert]]

A [[theatre]] '''lighting designer''' (or '''LD''') works with the [[theatre director|director]], [[choreographer]], [[set designer]], [[costume designer]], and [[sound designer]] to create the lighting, atmosphere, and time of day for the production in response to the text, while keeping in mind issues of visibility,  safety, and cost. The LD also works closely with the [[Stage management|stage manager]] or [[show control]] programming, if show control systems are used in that production.  Outside [[stage lighting]], the job of a Lighting Designer can be much more diverse and they can be found working on rock and pop tours, corporate launches, art installation and on massive celebration spectaculars, for example the Olympic Games opening and closing ceremonies.

==During pre-production==
The role of the lighting designer varies greatly within professional and amateur theater. For a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show, a touring production and most regional and small productions the LD is usually an outside freelance specialist hired early in the production process.  Smaller theatre companies may have a resident lighting designer responsible for most of the company's productions or rely on a variety of freelance or even volunteer help to light their productions. At the [[Off-Broadway]] or [[Off-Off-Broadway]] level, the LD will occasionally be responsible for much of the hands-on technical work (hanging instruments, programming the [[lighting control console|light board]], etc.) that would be the work of the lighting crew in a larger theater.

The LD will read the script carefully and make notes on changes in place and time between scenes - such changes are often done just with lighting to avoid too many blackouts in one scene - and will have meetings (called design or production meetings) with the director, designers, [[stage manager]], and [[production manager]] to discuss ideas for the show and establish budget and scheduling details.  The LD will also attend several later rehearsals to observe the way the [[actor]]s are being directed to use the stage area  ('blocking') during different scenes, and will receive updates from the [[stage manager]] on any changes that occur.  The LD will also make sure that he or she has an accurate plan of the theatre's lighting positions and a list of their equipment, as well as an accurate copy of the set design, especially the ground plan and section. The LD must take into account the show's mood and the director's vision in creating a lighting design.

Because lighting design is much more abstract than costume or scenic design, it is sometimes difficult for the lighting designer to accurately convey his or her ideas to the rest of the production team.  To help the LD communicate the ethereal aspects of lighting, he or she may employ renderings, storyboards, photographs, reproductions of artwork, or mockups of actual lighting effects to help communicate ideas about how the lighting should look. Various forms of paperwork are essential for the LD to successfully communicate their design to various members of the production team.  Examples of typical paperwork include cue sheets, lightplots, [[Instrument Schedule|instrument schedules]], shop orders and focus charts. Cue sheets communicate the placement of cues that the LD has created for the show, using artistic terminology rather than technical language, and information on exactly when each cue is called, so that the stage manager and the assistants know when and where to call the cue. Cue sheets are of the most value to stage management.

The [[light plot]] is a scale drawing that communicates the location of lighting fixtures and lighting positions so a team of electricians can independently install the lighting system.   Next to each instrument on the plan will be information for any [[color gel]], [[gobo (lighting)|gobo]], or other accessory that needs to go with it, and its channel number. Often, paperwork listing all of this information is also generated by using a program such as [[Lightwright]]. The lighting designer uses this paperwork to aid in the visualization of not only ideas but simple lists to assist the Master Electrician during load-in, focus and technical rehearsals.  Professional LDs generally use special [[computer-aided design]] packages to create accurate and easily readable drafted plots that can be swiftly updated as necessary.  The LD will discuss the plot with the show's production manager and the theatre's master electrician or technical director to make sure there are no unforeseen problems during load-in.

The lighting designer is responsible, in conjunction with the production's independently hired "Production Electrician" who will interface with the theatre's [[Master Electrician]], for directing the theatre's electrics crew in the realization of his or her designs during the technical rehearsals.  After the Electricians have hung, circuited and patched the lighting units, the LD will direct the focusing (pointing, shaping and sizing of the light beams) and gelling (coloring) of each unit.

After focus has occurred the LD usually sits at a temporary desk (tech table) in the theater (typically on the Center Line in the middle of the house) where he or she has a good view of the stage and work with the [[lighting board]] [[Light board operator|operator/programmer]], who will either be seated alongside him or her at a portable control console or talk via headset to the control room.  At the tech table, the LD will generally use a Magic Sheet, which is a pictorial layout of how the lights relate to the stage, so he or she can have quick access to channel numbers that control particular lighting instruments. The LD may also have a copy of the light plot and [[channel hookup]], a remote lighting console, a computer monitor connected to the light board (so they can see what the board op is doing), and a headset, though in smaller theatres this is less common.  There may be a period of time allowed for pre-lighting or "pre-cueing", a practice that is often done with people known as Light Walkers who stand in for performers so the LD can see what the light looks like on bodies.  At an arranged time, the performers arrive and the production is worked through in chronological order, with occasional stops to correct sound, lighting, entrances etc.; known as a "cue-to-cue" or [[technical rehearsal|tech rehearsal]].  The lighting designer will work constantly with the board operator to refine the lighting states as the technical rehearsal continues, but because the focus of a [[technical rehearsal|"tech" rehearsal]] is the production's technical aspects, the LD may require the performers to pause ("hold") frequently. Nevertheless, any errors of focusing or changes to the lighting plan are corrected only when the performers are not onstage.  These changes take place during 'work' or 'note' calls.  The LD only attends these notes calls if units are hung or rehung and require additional focusing.  The LD or Assistant Lighting Director (also known as the ALD, see below for description) will be in charge if in attendance.  If the only work to be done is maintenance (i.e. changing a lamp or burnt out gel) then the Production or Master Electrician will be in charge and will direct the Electrics crew.

After the tech process, the performance may (or may not, depending on time constraints) go into [[Dress rehearsal]] without a ticketed audience and/or [[Preview (theatre)|Previews]] with a ticketed audience.  During this time, if the cueing is finished, the LD will sit in the audience and take notes on what works and what needs changing.  At this point, the [[Stage Manager]] will begin to take over the work of calling cues for the light board op to follow.  Generally, the LD will stay on headset, and may still have a monitor connected to the light board in case of problems, or will be in the [[Control booth (theater)|control booth]] with the board operator when a monitor is not available.  Often, changes will take place during notes call, but if serious problems occur the performance may be halted and the issue will be resolved then.

Once the show is open to the public, the lighting designer will often stay and watch several performances of the show, making notes each night and making desired changes the next day during notes call.  If the show is still in previews, then the LD will make changes, but once the production officially opens, normally the lighting designer will not make further changes.

Changes should not be made after the lighting design is finished, and never without the LD's approval.  There may be times when changes are necessary after the production has officially opened.  Reasons for changes after opening night include: casting changes; significant changes in blocking; addition, deletion or rearrangement of scenes; or the tech and/or preview period (if there was a preview period) was too short to accommodate as thorough a cueing as was needed (this is particularly common in dance productions).  If significant changes need to be made, the LD will come in and make them, however if only smaller changes are needed, the LD may opt to send the ALD.  If a show runs for a particularly long time then the LD may come in periodically to check the focus of each lighting instrument and if they are retaining their color (some [[color gel|gel]], especially saturated gel, loses its richness and can fade or 'burn out' over time).  The LD may also sit in on a performance to make sure that the cues are still being called at the right place and time.  The goal is often to finish by the opening of the show, but what is most important is that the LD and the directors believe that the design is finished to each's satisfaction. If that happens to be by opening night, then after opening no changes are normally made to that particular production run at that venue.  The general maintenance of the lighting rig then becomes the responsibility of the Master Electrician.

==In small theatres==
It is uncommon for a small theatre to have a very large technical crew, as there is less work to do.  Many times, the lighting crew of a small theatre will consist of a single lighting designer and one to three people, who collectively are in charge of hanging, focusing and patching all lighting instruments. The lighting designer, in this situation, commonly works directly with this small team, fulfilling the role of both master electrician and lighting designer.  Many times the designer will directly participate in the focusing of lights.  The same crew will generally also program cues and operate the [[Lighting control console|light board]] during rehearsals and performances.  In some cases, the [[Lighting control console|light board]] and [[Mixing console|sound board]] are operated by the same person, depending on the complexity of the show.  The lighting designer may also take on other roles in addition to lights when they are finished hanging lights and programming cues on the board.

==Advances in visualization and presentation==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:180px-LDA08.jpg|thumb|left|LD Assistant 08 Total Show Simulation© Software with Integrated Real-time Video]] --&gt;
As previously mentioned, it is difficult to fully communicate the intent of a lighting design before all the lights are installed and all the cues are written.   With the advancement in computer processing and visualization software, lighting designers are now able to create [[Computer-generated imagery|computer generated images]] (CGI) that represent their ideas.  The lighting designer enters the light plot into the visualization software and then enters the ground plan of the theater and set design, giving as much three-dimensional data as possible (which helps in creating complete renderings).  This creates a 3D model in computer space that can be lit and manipulated.  Using the software, the LD can use the lights from his plot to create actual lighting in the 3D model with the ability to define parameters such as color, focus, gobo, beam angle etc.  The designer can then take renderings or "snapshots" of various looks that can then be printed out and shown to the director and other members of the design team.

==Mockups and lighting scale models==

In addition to computer visualization, either full scale or small scale mock ups are a good method for depicting a lighting designer's ideas.  Fiber optic systems such as  LightBox or Luxam allow a users to light a scale model of the set.  For example, a set designer can create a model of the set in 1/4" scale, the lighting designer can then take the fiber optic cables and attach them to scaled down lighting units that can accurately replicate the beam angles of specified lighting fixtures.  These 'mini lights' can then be attached to cross pieces simulating different lighting positions.  Fiber optic fixtures have the capacity to simulate attributes of full scale theatrical lighting fixtures including; color, beam angle, intensity, and gobos.  The most sophisticated  fiber optic systems are controllable through computer software or a [[DMX512-A|DMX]] controlled [[Lighting control console|Light board]].  This gives the lighting designer the ability to mock up real time lighting effects as they will look during the show.

==Additional members of the lighting design team==
If the production is large or especially complex, the Lighting Designer may hire additional lighting professionals to help execute the design.

===The Associate Lighting Designer===
The Associate Lighting Designer will help assist the Lighting Designer in creating and executing the lighting design.  While the duties that an LD may expect the Associate LD to perform may differ from person to person, usually the Ass't LD will do the following:
*Attend design and production meetings with or in place of the LD
*Attend rehearsals with or in place of LD and take notes of specific design ideas and tasks that the lighting department needs to accomplish
*Assist the LD in generating the light plot, channel hookup and sketches
*If needed, the Associate may need to take the set drawings and put them into a CAD program to be manipulated by the LD (however, this job is usually given to the Assistant LD if there is one).
*The Ass't LD may be in charge of running focus, and may even direct where the lights are to be focused.
*The Associate is generally authorized to speak on behalf of the LD and can make creative and design decisions when needed (and when authorized by the LD).  This is one of the biggest differences between the Associate and the Assistant.

===The Assistant Lighting Designer===
The Assistant Lighting Designer assists the Lighting Designer and the Associate Lighting Designer.  Depending on the particular arrangement the ALD may report directly to the LD, or they may in essence be the Associate's assistant.  There also may be more than one assistant on a show depending on the size of the production.  The ALD will usually:
*Attend design and production meetings with the LD or the Associate LD
*Attend rehearsals with the LD or the Associate LD
*Assist the LD in generating the light plot and channel hookup.  If the plot is to be computer generated, the ALD is the one who physically enters the information into the computer.
*The ALD may run errands for the LD such as picking up supplies or getting the light plot printed in large format.
*The ALD will help the Associate LD in running focus.
*The ALD may take [https://web.archive.org/web/20101119033446/http://www.mckernon.com/_/Focus_Charts.html Focus Charts] during focus.
*Track and coordinate [[Followspot]]s (if any exist for the production) and generate paperwork to aid in their cueing and color changes.
*In rare instances the ALD may be the light board operator.

===A note on focus===
During focus, the LD is up on stage directing members of the Electrics crew on where and how to focus each individual lighting unit.  This can be a time consuming and frustrating process.  Focus can run much smoother if the Associate LD and the Assistant LD are keeping good track of which lights have been focused, what's coming up next and directing the electrics crew so that there is minimal down time between focusing each light.  They should also direct the LD to which units are next and even what their purpose is and a rough focus.

[[Image:GoldenTreasuryAmberol.jpg|180px|right|Cover of "A Golden Treasury of Edison Blue Amberol Records" catalog]]
[[Blue Amberol Records]] was the trademark for a type of [[cylinder recording]] manufactured by the [[Edison Records]] company in the U.S. from 1912 to 1929.  Made from a [[nitrocellulose]] compound developed at the Edison laboratory—though occasionally employing [[Bakelite]] in its stead and always employing an inner layer of plaster—these cylinder records were introduced for public sale in October 1912. The first release in the main, Popular series was number 1501, and the last, 5719, issued in October 1929 just as the Edison Records concern closed up shop. The Edison company also maintained separate issue number ranges for foreign, classical and special series that are not included here. The issue numbers are not necessarily continuous as some titles were not released, or otherwise skipped. Nevertheless, the Blue Amberol format was the longest-lived cylinder record series employed by the Edison Company.&lt;ref&gt;UCSB Cylinder Preservation Project: Edison Blue Amberol Cylinders 1912-1929 [http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/history-blueamberol.php]&lt;/ref&gt; These were designed to be played on an [[Amberola]], a type of Edison machine specially designed for celluloid records that did not play older wax cylinders. Blue Amberols are more commonly seen today than earlier Edison 2-minute brown or black wax and 4-minute black wax Amberol records.

The following very incomplete list of Blue Amberol Records is ranked by '''issue number''', '''title''', '''writer(s)''', '''performer(s)''' and '''date'''. Dates are certainly not chronological for either recording or issue; the issue of certain titles could be delayed or never deployed, and some Blue Amberol releases are merely reissues of earlier records that had appeared in other formats before the Blue Amberol existed. From about July 1914, Edison's Diamond Discs were used to master Blue Amberols and releases of the same titles appear in both series, though with totally different release numbers. Some of the very last Blue Amberols were dubbed from electrical recordings, though the Amberola was never manufactured with an electrical pickup; in later years, some enthusiasts have refitted Amberola players with electrical pickups and there{{where?|date=June 2014}} is evidence that even at the end of the 1920s there were kits one could order to make the conversion.

'''''Lot and his Daughters, with Sodom and Gomorrah Burning''''' is a [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] in pen and [[watercolour]] from a very late  [[illuminated manuscript]] bible. The illustration by [[Procopie_(Picu)_Pătruț|Picu Pătruț]] (1818 — 1872) of [[Transylvania]], begun on May 24, 1842, is one of the 139 miniatures made from 1842 to 1851 for the "Bible of St. Petersburg" from 1819.&lt;ref&gt;Diacon Conf. &lt;/ref&gt; 

The page size is 19 x 15 centimeters. It is in the collection of the [[Museum of the Romanian Peasant]].&lt;ref name="europeana"&gt;[https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063601/_77034b15_0bf4_40ec_93a8_3081dfdaa7d4.html Sodom and Gommorah Burning] la Europeana&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene uses the traditional [[iconography]] for the biblical scene of [[Lot and his daughters]], leaving the [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Cities of the Plain]], led by an angel. On the right behind them is Lot's wife, who was turned into a pillar of salt for looking back to the city.

The '''''Man of Sorrows''''' is a 1532 painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age]] painter [[Maarten van Heemskerck]] in the collection of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/images/219759 Man van smarten, 1532 (gedateerd)] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The subject depicts Christ after the crucifixion attended by angels, with wounds prominently displayed, wearing the [[crown of thorns]] and a [[loincloth]].  The loincloth is claimed to be wrapped around an erection, visible to some art historians but not others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altpenis.com/penis_news/holy_penis.shtml The Holy Penis], accessed December 15, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115201320/http://www.altpenis.com/penis_news/holy_penis.shtml |date=November 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Van Heemskerck is not the only Renaissance artist to depict Christ with an erection (''ostentatio genitalium''), which some scholars interpret as a symbol of his resurrection and continuing power.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, Leo. ''The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion''. Chicago: University Of Chicago Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-226-77187-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Newberry Opera House''', located in [[Newberry, South Carolina]], is a fully restored historic building that is a live-performance space for popular artists, touring theatre companies, and local organizations.&lt;ref name = nrhpinv&gt;{{Cite web | last = Fant | first = Mrs. James W. | coauthor = | title =  Newberry Opera House | work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | date = November 11, 1969 | url = http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/newberry/S10817736001/S10817736001.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = scdah&gt;{{Cite web | title = Newberry Opera House, Newberry County (Boyce &amp; Nance Sts., Newberry)  | work = National Register Properties in South Carolina | publisher = South Carolina Department of Archives and History | url = http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/newberry/S10817736001/index.htm | accessdate = 27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1969.&lt;ref name = nris/&gt;

Designed in the French [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic style]], the first floor of the building was used by the town government for offices, a jail, and the fire company, which had one engine there.  The upper floor was designed as a theater and supporting spaces.  For years it attracted national touring companies, individual performers and a variety of theatre acts. It later was adapted also for use as a movie theater, but showed its last movie in 1952. It was restored beginning in 1998, in a project that included an addition to enable its use for full theatrical productions.

==History==
The building was designed in the French [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic style]] as both a place of entertainment and as a seat of government for the city. The building, completed in 1881 and dedicated in 1882, had a clock tower {{convert|130|ft|m}} topped with a [[garfish]] weather vane.

The original design called for the first floor to house the fire engine room, town council chambers, a clerk's office, a police officer, and three jail cells. The second floor contained a hall with 426 seats, 53 by {{convert|52|ft|m}} in size.  Also on this floor were a ticket office, a "green room", a cloakroom, and three dressing rooms. Drop curtains and seven scenes or sets for the stage were available. One scene, a landscape, survived to the late 20th century.

The Opera House quickly became known as "the entertainment center of the Midlands". Touring companies of [[New York City]] [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[minstrel]] and [[variety shows]], famed vocalists and lecturers, magicians and mind readers, novelty acts and boxing exhibitions all were featured there. It was used not only by professional performers, but also by the community for meetings, dances, college commencement exercises, and musicals. Notable artists, such as [[Edwin Booth]], [[John Barrymore]] and his family, and [[Tallulah Bankhead]] are known to have performed there.

The first film shown there was ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915), a [[silent movie]], and others followed.  The early [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] "[[Talkies]]," using a [[phonograph]] record for sound, were introduced in the 1920s. Slowly, movies replaced the stage shows.  In the 1920s, the Opera House was remodeled as a movie theater.

In 1952, after the showing of ''[[The Outlaw]]'', the Opera House was closed as a movie theater.  During the movie era, the original horseshoe-shaped balcony was reduced in size, this restricted seating across the back of the auditorium to blacks only; the state had racial segregation in facilities. The city added an outdoor open stairway which they required blacks to use for entry. Since the mid-1960s, such public facilities have been integrated.

By 1959, there was talk about tearing the building down, but the hall was still used for community purposes, and the city used the first floor. In 1969, the [[Newberry Historical Society]] promoted the preservation of the Opera House, as did several other community groups. In 1970, the building was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

After the City of Newberry vacated the building in the mid 1990s, the Newberry Opera House Foundation was established to assess restoration.  Recognizing the lack of performance spaces in the Midlands, it consulted with experts about a proposed project.  Since proceeding with a restoration plan, it has managed fundraising and operations of the facility, which it leases from the city.

The exterior restoration and window replacement was completed in 1994, and the interior renovation began in 1996. It included restoration of the horseshoe-shaped balcony.  An additional {{convert|10000|sqft|m2}} was added to the original building in order to create a full theatrical production facility: a new loading dock, an elevator, a second stage for rehearsal, and dressing rooms. The total cost of the renovation was approximately $5.5 million.  Architects for the renovation and addition were [http://www.cgdarch.com Craig Gaulden Davis] of Greenville, South Carolina.

A variety of theatrical touring companies and live-performance artists from [[Willie Nelson]] to [[Michael Bolton]], the Newberry Ballet Guild, South Carolina Opera Company and [[Asheville Lyric Opera]] have all performed there, keeping the hall busy. It has a maximum capacity of 426. It is also used for performances by Newberry College and other community institutions.

South Carolinians [[Josh Turner]], [[Edwin McCain]], [[Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs]], and [[Chubby Checker]] have all performed at the Newberry Opera House in recent years. [[The Charlie Daniels Band]], [[The Tams]], [[Art Garfunkel]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], [[Puddle of Mudd]] and [[Saliva (band)|Saliva]] (in 2018) have also performed at the Opera House in recent years.

The '''Palace of the Shirvanshahs''' ({{lang-az|Şirvanşahlar Sarayı}}, {{lang-fa|کاخ شروان‌شاهان}}) is a 15th-century palace built by the [[Shirvanshah]]s and described by UNESCO as "one of the pearls of Azerbaijan's architecture". It is located in the Inner City of [[Baku]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://azerbaijan24.com/about/azerbaijan_cities/baku/palace_of_the_shirvanshahs/|title=Palace of the Shirvanshahs|website=azerbaijan24.com|language=EN|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Azerbaijan]] and, together with the [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]], forms an ensemble of historic monuments inscribed under the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]] of Historical Monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/958 |title=Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace and Maiden Tower&amp;nbsp;– UNESCO World Heritage Centre |last=Centre |first=UNESCO World Heritage |publisher=UNESCO |language=en|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex contains the main building of the palace, Divanhane, the [[burial vault (tomb)|burial-vaults]], the shah's mosque with a minaret, Seyid Yahya Bakuvi's mausoleum (the so-called "mausoleum of the [[dervish]]"), south of the palace, a portal in the east, Murad's gate, a reservoir and the remnants of a bath house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.window2baku.com/eng/shirvan/9sh_00shirvan.htm|title=The Ensemble of the Shirvanshahs’ Palace|last=Nasibov|first=Faig|website=www.window2baku.com|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, there was an ancient mosque, next to the mausoleum. There are still ruins of the bath and the lamb, belong to the west of the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.visions.az/en/news/159/cdc770e3/|title=Visions of Azerbaijan Magazine ::: The Palace of the Shirvanshahs|work=Visions of Azerbaijan Magazine|access-date=2018-06-06|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, the palace was surrounded by a wall with towers and, thus, served as the inner stronghold of the Baku fortress. Despite the fact that at the present time no traces of this wall have survived on the surface, as early as the 1920s, the remains of apparently the foundations of the tower and the part of the wall connected with it could be distinguished in the north-eastern side of the palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://azincoming.az/visitazerbaijan/dvorec-shirvanshaxov/|title=Palace of the Shirvanshahs|website=Турагентство в Баку, туры по Азербайджану, туры по Баку|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no inscriptions survived on the palace itself. Therefore, the time of its construction is determined by the dates in the inscriptions on the architectural monuments, which refer to the complex of the palace. Such two inscriptions were completely preserved only on the tomb and minaret of the Shah's mosque. There is a name of the ruler who ordered to establish these buildings in both inscriptions is the – Shirvan Khalil I (years of rule 1417–1462). As time of construction – 839 (1435/36) was marked on the tomb, 845 (1441/42) on the minaret of the Shah's mosque.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The burial vault, the palace and the mosque are built of the same material, the grating and masonry of the stone are the same.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesco.preslib.az/en/page/vwDYTl9EcS|title=UNESCO World Heritage List|last=Huseynzade|first=Tuncay|date=|website=unesco.preslib.az|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex used to occupy more place. There were rooms for court servants and services.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

The main buildings of the ensemble were built at different times. Despite this fact, these buildings are linked by unity of scale, by rhythm and proportionality of the basic architectural forms – cubic volumes of buildings, domes, portraits. The builders of the ensemble relied on the traditions of the Shirvan-Absheron [[Architecture of Azerbaijan|architectural school]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.everycastle.com/Palace-of-the-Shirvanshahs.html|title=Palace of the Shirvanshahs – Castles, Palaces and Fortresses|website=www.everycastle.com|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the palace complex was declared a museum-preserve and taken under the protection of the state. In 2000, this ensemble, along with the fortified walls of the historic part of the city and the Maiden Tower, was included in the [[World Heritage site|UNESCO World Heritage List.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/958|title=Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace and Maiden Tower|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bakushopfest.com/en/sightseeings-in-azerbaijan/|title=Sightseeng in Azerbaijan {{!}} Baku Shopping Festival|work=Baku Shopping Festival|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the 15th&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Бретаницкий, Леонид Семёнович|Бретаницкий Л. С.]] Зодчество Азербайджана XII-XV вв. и его место в архитектуре Переднего Востока / Главная редакция восточной литературы.&amp;nbsp;– Наука, 1966..&amp;nbsp;– С. 401.&amp;nbsp;– 556 с.&lt;/ref&gt; century the [[Shirvanshah]] dynasty, under [[Ibrahim I of Shirvan]], transferred his capital from [[Shemakha]] to Baku following a devastating earthquake. He committed himself to the construction of the "palace".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2016}} The building is believed to be a memorial complex built around the sacred [[place of worship]] ([[Pir (Sufism)|pir]]) and tomb of Seyyid Yaxya Bakuvi who was a [[Khalwati order|Helwati]] [[Sufi]] saint. The Shirvanshahs were patrons of the Helwati Sufiye order, and Shirvanshah [[Khalilullah I]] was buried with his family in the grounds of the palace. Other historians argue that the building was used as the ruler's palace. Both theories suffer from the absence of evidence. It is known that wells inside the grounds of the "palace" were considered to have healing qualities until recent times, as was the hill where the palace was built.

After the [[Safavid]] conquest of Baku in 1501, the Sufi order was expelled. Over centuries the "palace" fell into ruin and was known in Baku as Baku Khans palace; this [[toponym]] moved into Russian historiography, first cited by [[Bartold]].

Until 1501, there wasn't any information found about the building of the palace. According to one of the Persian chronicles, in 1501 the troops of shirvanshakh Farrukh-yessar, the son Khalil-ully I, were defeated in Shemakha by the troops of Shah Ismail I from the Safavid dynasty. Farrukh-yessar was killed in the battle of shirvanshah; the troops of Ismail I, having defeated near Shemakha, moved to Baku, besieged it and after several assaults took the city.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Then, a tall building of Shirvanshahs was destroyed due to the order of Shah Ismail I. After a while, the city of Baku and its entire district, as well as Shirvan, were governed by the governors who were placed by the Safavids. There is not any detailed information about the people who lived in the palace and in what state it was in the first half of the XVI century.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

In the second half of the 16th century there was a war between the Safavids and [[Ottoman Empire|the Ottoman Empire]]. In 1578, the Turks conquered Baku. From the time of the rule of the Ottoman Empire in the palace area, the gate in the palace wall surrounding the palace from the east has been preserved. From the inscription placed on the portal of this gate, it follows that they were built during the reign of the Turkish [[Murad III|sultan Murad III]] (1574–1595 years of rule).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.azernews.az/travel/99282.html|title=Shirvanshahs Palace :history and curiosities PHOTO|date=13 July 2016|work=AzerNews.az|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the literary works, there were Turkish pashas living in the palace at that time. The East Gate is a witness of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://islamtimes.co.uk/ru/article/article/Dvorets_shahov_Shirvana/19342|title=Дворец шахов Ширвана|work=islamtimes.co.uk|access-date=2018-06-06|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the XVII century, the palace was empty, and there were not any government officials. The abbot of the monastery and the representative of the [[Isfahan]] mission Capuchin Pater Raphael du Mans in his essay in 1660 described Shirvanshah Palace in Baku fortress and gave information about its desolation and destruction. In 1723, Baku was besieged by the troops of [[Peter the Great|Peter I]], and the city was bombed. In this regard, the south-eastern facades of the palace suffered much. The palace was transferred to the Russian military department in the middle of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldheritagesite.org/list/Walled+City+of+Baku|title=Walled City of Baku – Unesco World Heritage Site {{!}} For World Heritage Travellers|website=www.worldheritagesite.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian military department made a partial renovation of the palace. At the same time, the significant restructuring was carried out, which adapted the palace facilities to warehouses for military equipment. Repairs carried out by the military department, along with the restoration of the destroyed parts, and led to the destruction of a number of parts required for the restoration of the palace.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By adapting the building of the palace to the warehouse, the military department demolished a number of walls separating the rooms in the second and first floors, and there were semi-circular arches supporting the roof instead of them on the second floor.

The remains of domed, lancet and cross-slabs were destroyed in all the rooms on the second floor; they were replaced by flat beams. And window openings (double-glazed windows) of the second floor were laid out so that only small windows remained. New wide doorways were pierced.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anl.az/down/meqale/kaspi/2010/iyul/129070.htm|title=Palace of the Shirvanshahs. History|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, [[Orthodoxy in Azerbaijan|the Orthodox Church in Baku]] sought the demolition of the palace to build a Baku cathedral in its place. However, this petition was rejected by the tsarist authorities only because the premises of the palace were used for large warehouses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

There was an entrance made to the second floor of the northern facade of the palace and a huge opening was punched in the wall. This was done for the cart drawn by the horses from the street would enter the second floor of the palace. After making the above-mentioned reorganization, the military department attached a ladder to the eastern facade of the palace, and the entire southern (or lower) courtyard was surrounded by a stone wall with loopholes. This wall was erected from a foundation left from the old walls surrounding the palace.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.alluringworld.com/palace-of-the-shirvanshahs/|title=Palace of the Shirvanshahs {{!}} {{!}} Alluring World|date=26 January 2018|work=Alluring World|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The palace ensemble is now protected by fortress walls erected in the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://castellinelmondo.altervista.org/en/castle/azerbaijan/abseron/baku-fortress/|title=Baku Fortress in Azerbaijan – Abşeron|website=castellinelmondo.altervista.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During existence of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] (1918–1920), a number of measures were taken to study and fix architectural monuments. Thus, at the end of 1918, the dimensional drawings of the Shirvanshahs Palace were made by the Ishmael Bek Nabi oglu, the architectural engineer. At the beginning of 1920, several cycles of lectures on the fate of the palace were read in the "Society for the Study of the Muslim East" by Ismail bek Nabi oglu. The periodical press indicated that the report was illustrated by various photographs and drawings of the palace. After the reports and debates, the presidium of the society was elected, which included chairman Professor Zimin, Comrade chairman I Belyaev, secretary-teacher Seidov and Kazioni Subkhanverdikhanov. The meeting instructed the presidium to organize an excursion to the palace in the near future.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 1920, the government of the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijani SSR]] began to take measures to protect the monument. Since 1920, the cleaning of the palace from the age-old layers of garbage and partial repairs began, accompanied by archaeological reconnaissance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 1924 the works were continued. After the large repair and restoration works of 1932–1934, conducted by AzCUOP together with the Moscow State Restoration Workshops for projects designed by architect Boris Zasypkin, the building of the former Shirvanshah palace was given to the Azerbaijan History Museum AzFAN. Since the clay floors were fragile, and the building of the palace was intended for the organization of a museum in it, during the repair and restoration work the floors were covered with parquet. Also during the works from the window openings were laid the stones laid in the XIX century, and they were returned to their original appearance. The original layout of the second floor was not restored, due to the fact that the premises were supposed to be a museum: where there are only two rooms, there were originally eight rooms. The plan of the first floor was completely restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gattesco|first=Natalino|last2=Macorini|first2=Lorenzo|date=2015|title=Structural Performance of Old Composite Floors Made up of Wrought Iron Joists and Masonry Vaults|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/amm.796.13|journal=Applied Mechanics and Materials|volume=796|pages=13–24|doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/amm.796.13|issn=1662-7482|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937-1938 under the guidance of archaeologist V.N. Leviatov, archaeological excavations were carried out in the palace and a large number of artifacts dating from the 12th-15th centuries were found. And the archaeological excavations conducted by Leviatov in 1945 on the territory of the palace ensemble, deep beneath the foundations of the surviving buildings, revealed the remains of a once densely populated residential quarter. Numerous fragments of ceramic products and coins date it to the VIII-IX centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elibrary.bsu.az/books_460/N_440.pdf|title=Archaeological excavations in Azerbaijan during USSR|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some time, the Azerbaijan People's Museum and the Museum of the History of Religion were located in the palace building. In 1960, the palace was turned into an architectural reserve, which in 1964 was transformed into the State Historical and Architectural Museum-Reserve "Complex of the Shirvanshahs Palace".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deyerlerimiz.az/ru/%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2/%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%86-%D1%88%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%88%D0%B0%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B2/|title=Дворец ширваншахов {{!}} Demokratiyanın və  Milli Dəyərlərin Təbliği  İctimai Birliyi|website=deyerlerimiz.az|language=ru-RU|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, new restoration works began. The author of the restoration project of the palace complex was Niyazi Rzayev. Restoration began from the throne room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/azerbaijan/baku/attractions/palace-of-the-shirvanshahs/a/poi-sig/444235/358673|title=Palace of the Shirvanshahs|website=www.lonelyplanet.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, at the 24th session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, the historical part of the city of Baku, Icheri Sheher, along with the palace, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site from Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These were the first objects included in the list of UNESCO, located on the territory of Azerbaijan. In 2006, the next restoration of the palace was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azerizv.az/news/a-8353.html|title=Газета Азербайджанские Известия – Рена РЗАЕВА, директор Дворца Ширваншахов: "Наши двери всегда открыты для гостей" – Главная – Новости|last=Известия|first=Газета Азербайджанские|website=www.azerizv.az|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The main building (the Palace) ====
The building of the palace did not arise at once. The building of the complex was started in 1411 by Shirvanshah Sheykh Ibrahim I. The two-storey building of the palace numbers about 50 dimensions and outlines of the constructions connected with three narrow winding staircases. The big lancet portal directly leads from the courtyard to the second floor, into a high octahedral lodging covered with a cupola. A small, octagonal vestibule behind it connects it with the rest of the lodgings in the palace.

The earliest building (approximately the end of the fourteenth century) is the central part (octagonal hall of the second floor). The part adjoining the western facade was added a little later. The western, northern and a small part of the eastern facades form an incomplete rectangle. The rest of the eastern facade and the entire southern facade are formed by two triangular lanterns and a broken line between them, enclosing four right angles.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

There were originally 52 rooms connected by three narrow spiral staircases in the palace building: 27 on the first and 25 on the second floor (currently 16 rooms on the second floor), and the layout of the second floor basically reproduced the plan of the first floor. The central part of the palace (octagonal hall of the second floor, the entrance to which is decorated with a portal) has thicker walls. Arranged in the western facade, the main entrance to the palace is decorated with a high portal. The ladder of the portal leads to a tall octagonal front hall, covered with a dome. It is assumed that this room served for receptions.

The small octagonal lobby behind it connected the hall to the rest of the rooms. Slit-shaped holes in the faces served as a voice connection with the lower floor, where the office premises were located. The rooms and rooms of the second floor are more ceremonial. Among them, there are the southern and eastern facades with bay windows that reveal the bay view. There are also rooms for the Shah and his family on the second floor.

The smooth surface of the large stone planes of the palace is shaded by alternating rows of masonry, differing in color, width and texture, as well as the "shebeke" aura – stone gratings in small light apertures.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

There were daily-life objects, coins of the XII-XV centuries, copper utensils, weapons and decorations of the XIX century, musical instruments of the XV century found during the archaeological excavations both on the territory of the palace complex and in the territory of the historical center of Icheri-Sheher and Shirvan. There were also female costumes and embroidery of the XIX century, Shemakha carpets of the XIX century and carpet woven in the XVII century in Baku. There is a mock-up of the historic part of the city in the center of the hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/82_folder/82_articles/82_shirvanshah.html|title=8.2 The Shirvanshah Palace: The Splendor of the Middle Ages|website=www.azer.com|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Palacio de los Shirvanshah, Baku, Azerbaiyán, 2016-09-26, DD 154.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Turbe (Mausoleum) of Shirvanshahs in Baku. 15th century.]]

==== Divan-khana ====
A small aperture, located on the north side of the palace garden, leads to the closed courtyard Divan-khana, which is framed on three sides by a pointed arcade. In the composition center Divan-khana there is an octagonal rotunda-pavilion. The hall of this rotunda is surrounded by an open arcade of the same warrant. The elliptical cover with a slightly pointed top is protected from the outside by a faceted stone dome. The western facade of the rotunda is decorated with arabesques which are stylized with a portal, the channeled half-cupola of the lancet conch is supported by a system of finely modeled stalactites (mucarnases). Overhead planes are covered with ornament. The portal leads to the canopy connecting the hall with the and service rooms located one above the other.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iguzzini.com/projects/project-gallery/shirvanshahs-palace-complex/|title=A project of Palace of the Shirvanshahs|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several versions of the appointment of Divan-khana.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; It was supposed to serve as a building for legal proceedings, receptions or state council, or perhaps, it was a mausoleum. The most common hypothesis is based on the common name of the monument, according to which it was assumed that it is a court, or a reception room of the palace, or the building of an "order". The features of the style and the incompleteness of the part of the decoration work allow one to date Divan-khana to the end of the 15th century, the time of the capture of Baku by the Safavid troops. The features of the plan, the dungeon-crypt and the content of the lapidary inscription above the entrance to the hall (Koran, Sura 10, verses 26 and 27) indicate his memorial appointment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The origin of the original architectural structure is also associated with the pre-Islamic funerary tradition. Historian [[Sara Ashurbeyli]] believes that even in pre-Islamic times, the occupied Divan-khan territory was a sacred place (it is assumed that the cup-shaped grooves served to collect the sacrificial blood of animals)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elibrary.bsu.az/books_460/N_440.pdf|title=Historians about Palace of the Shirvanshahs|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Keygubad Mosque ====
In the old days, a mosque was added to the mausoleum of Seyyid Yahya Bakuvi, which was called the "old" mosque. It is known as the "Kei-Kubad Mosque". This mosque was built at the end of the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth century after the destruction of the older building on which it was built. The mosque was covered with a dome, which was supported by four stone columns that stood inside the mosque. The clutches of the mosque were tied up with the laying of the mausoleum. In 1918, the "old" mosque burned down during a fire. The image of this mosque and its brief description was given in the article of Andrei Pavlinov, who visited Baku and saw the mosque in 1888, published in the third issue of the journal "Materials on the Archeology of the Caucasus" (Moscow, 1893)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visions.az/en/news/159/cdc770e3/]&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Abbasgulu Bakikhanov]] wrote that Bakuvi taught and prayed in the mosque: "The cell where he prayed, the school where he worked and his grave are there, in the mosque". Keygubad Shirvanshah ruled from 1317 to 1343 and was Sheikh Ibrahim's grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.visions.az/en/news/159/cdc770e3/|title=Visions of Azerbaijan Magazine ::: The Palace of the Shirvanshahs|work=Visions of Azerbaijan Magazine|access-date=2017-05-19|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, when E. A Pakhomov surveyed the mausoleum and ruins of the old mosque, it was discovered that the pedestal on which the base of one of the mosque columns stood, covers a narrow trench made in the ground and plastered into the crypt of the mausoleum. In this trench, there were several stone tombstones. When examining the crypt, it was found that there were scattered bones to twenty human skeletons. The bones were folded without observing any rules. This is due to the fact that at the place where the mausoleum stood and around it, there was once a cemetery. And during the construction of the mosque and digging foundation pits under the foundations, a number of burials were broken. Bones from the broken graves were collected and stacked in the mausoleum, and gravestones – in the trench. These tombstones are not preserved. Currently, on the site where the mosque once stood, there are two columns that once stood inside the mosque, as well as part of the wall with the roof.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Mausoleum of Seyyid Yahya Bakuvi ====
In the southern courtyard, next to the palace, stands a mausoleum, built in the second half of the 15th century, called the mausoleum of the "dervish" and known as the burial of the court scholar Khalil Ili Seyid Yahya Bakuvi, who was engaged in medicine, mathematics, and astrology. The mausoleum has an octagonal body, which completes the pyramidal tent. The interior of the mausoleum consists of an underground crypt where the tombstone of Bakuvi is located, and a camera above it. Small octagonal volume of the mausoleum turns into a drum covered with a dome. On the sides of the mausoleum there are three small windows carved into solid slabs of limestone, and, like in the old days, they are through-through stone gratings, consisting of multi-beam stars. The archway in the northern part is connected the mausoleum with an older mosque.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; According to Abbaskuli aga Bakikhanov, "the cell where he prayed [Bakuvi], the school and the grave that are under the mosque named after him, still exist today".

==== The palace mosque ====
In the front of the lower courtyard, there is a mosque building with a minaret. In terms of the mosque is rectangular, has a large hall, a small women's chapel and service rooms. The northern portal is facing the Shirvanshahs burial vault. This portal is more solemn than the east, which was intended for the inhabitants of the palace, descending the semi-underground passage. The double-lighted hall is covered with a dome on spherical sails.&lt;ref name="vestikavkaza.ru"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vestikavkaza.ru/articles/Legendy-Dvortsa-SHirvanshakhov.html|title=Легенды Дворца Ширваншахов {{!}} Вестник Кавказа|website=vestikavkaza.ru|language=ru-RU|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mihrab mosque is located at the southern end of the hall. Above the one-woman women's chapel there is also a domed room. It is inferior in size to the dome of the hall and repeats its outlines.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Against the backdrop of the prismatic volume, completed by two domes with slightly pointed tunnels, a deeply shaded aperture of the mosque portal is clearly drawn.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Above the northeast corner of the mosque stands a minaret, ending with a stalactite cornice supporting a balcony that had a stone barrier before. The inscription encircles the minaret below the stalactite cornice. It is executed in the font "nash" and contains inscription.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elibrary.bsu.az/books_460/N_440.pdf|title=A structure of Palace of the Shirvanshahs|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription says about the construction of the minaret, but not the mosque that was built at an earlier time. This is confirmed by the lack of a decorated rich portal and artistic inscriptions on it.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== The Eastern Portal ====
On the territory of the southern courtyard of the complex was the so-called Eastern Portal, also known as the "Gate of Murad".&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icherisheher.gov.az/static,33/lang,en/|title=Icherisheher :: Museums|last=|date=|website=www.icherisheher.gov.az|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of this portal completed the formation of the ensemble. Judging by the inscription on the portal niche, the portal was built during the years of occupation of Baku by Ottoman troops at the behest of a noble Bakrada of the Rajab Baba in 994 AH (1585/86) by architect Amir Shah of Vaillankoukh (suburb of Tabriz). Compared with the Divan-khana portals and the Shirvanshahs burial vault, the structure and forms of the portal are somewhat simplified. It has a less rich and elegant decor. The upper part of the portal is decorated with a building inscription in Arabic.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The inscription has sockets with floral ornaments on both sides. In the lower part of the portal, there is a deep niche formed by a stalactite semi-double. Unlike other portals of the palace, the Eastern portal has a wide lancet entrance opening, similar to the gate. Sarah Ashurbeyli assumes that this structure was the entrance to a building that did not survive, or was not erected.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Shrine ====
Near the shah's mosque in the lower courtyard, in the wall separating the lower platform from the upper one, is located the building of the Shirvanshahs burial vault, the so-called "Turbe". This building is located directly opposite the entrance, overlapped by a pointed vault. Smooth wall of the facade is lined with Baku limestone with a careful fit of the seams. Above the building, there is a richly decorated portal to the tomb. This portal repeats the compositional reception of the Divan-khan portal, but in comparison with the latter it is somewhat easier to interpret (the stalactite arch consists of only four rows of stalactites, the side walls are smoothly solved, no niches,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; and only tympanum of the arches, a number of inscriptions in the font "nash" – Koranic (Surah XII, verse 92nd) and hadith.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

On the right and left of the portal's lancet aperture in two onion-shaped medallions are inscriptions with the name of the builder-architect of the tomb. In each medallion, the same inscription is repeated twice (in direct and mirror image) and contains the following words: Allah Muhammad Ali (an architect). Judging by the name, the architect was a Shiite. Above the ornamentation of the tympanum of the stalactite arch there is a strip with an inscription of a religious nature. In the tympanas, medallions are also arranged on each side, also with an inscription. The inscription above the entrance to the portal dates the construction of the burial vault 839 (1435/36) and reports that the tomb was built by Shirvanshah Halilullah for his mother and son.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The portal leads to the canopy, on the right and left side of which are located associated with the opening of small rooms, probably intended for ministers of worship. The canopies lead to the main hall, which is cross-shaped in plan, and its central part is covered with a dome resting on the vaults of the branches of the cross and stone walls through a system of spherical sails. It is interesting that outside the stone dome was once covered with turquoise glaze.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

During the archaeological excavations in the tomb were found fragments of architectural details of tombstones in the hall, as well as a number of burials of members of the family of Halilullah. So, archaeological works in 1946 under the wooden floor of the tomb, a crypt was found with five burials, covered with stone slabs (one of them contained the remains of a child of 6–7 years old, apparently the son of Halilullah, the other – older women, probably the mother of Halilullah, the skeleton of a man is 18–19 years old). The continuation of the work in the tomb found a number of untouched tombs, the total number of which reached 14. The names of the members of the family of Halilullah can be found on the basis of odes, elegies and chronograms from the sofa of [[Badr Shirvani]]: the mother of Halilullah Bike khanum (died 839 AH / 1435/6), his sons Farrukh Yamin (born 839 AH / 1435/6, died in 846 AH / 1442/3 at the age of seven), Sheikh Saleh (born in 847 AH / 1443, died in 849 AH / 1445/6 at the age of 2 years), Mir Bahram (killed ( Shaheed) in the Kaytag steppe at a young age of 20 Muharram in 850 AH / 17 April 1446), Prince Muhammad Ibrahim (born 20 Muharram 836 / 16 September 1432), Farrukh Yasar (born 12 Muharram 845 AH / 2 June 1441).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Bathhouses ====
In the lower courtyard of the complex, there is a bathhouse, the location of which does not allow us to contour the territory that belonged to the palace. It is assumed, however, that the bathhouse, built in the 15th century, was indeed a palace. The bath was cleared of blockages, and the internal layout of the bath was restored thanks to the conservation of the lower rows of wall masonry.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The palace bath, like the vast majority of the baths of the East, was buried in the ground, but only the entrance portal and the domes of large halls were visible from the outside, the crowns of which ended with perforated lanterns that served as ventilation. Such a strong depth of the bath was typical for the baths of the entire Absheron peninsula.

The visitor of the bath from the vestibule-dressing room got into the soap-house, where there was a swimming pool for general ablution. To the soap adjoining large and small rooms, intended for all procedures that required a different temperature. The necessary temperature of the various rooms, depending on their destination, was tried to preserve the internal layout of the bath. In one of the last chambers of the bathhouse, there was a tank with hot water. Under it, there was a firebox, which served to heat all the premises of the bath. The underground, the stables and the walls of the baths were heated by a branched system of heat-conducting channels.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hg2.com/venue/shirvanshahs-palace/|title=Shirvanshah's Palace – One of the Best Palaces in Old City, Baku|work=Hg2|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ovdan ====
Not far from the bathhouse is located the ovdan – a reservoir, which was one of the largest in the Fortress of the Ovdans. This ovdan supplied drinking water not only to the palace, but also to the entire surrounding area. This assumption is confirmed by the nearby small, built in the XIV century Chin Mosque, which is believed to have served the residents of the nearby area. Ovdan supplied water to the palace bathhouse.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Ovdan is a spacious reservoir located deep underground, which was ventilated by means of a special vertical shaft. Such a structure is typical for most of the ovdans surviving till the present day. To descend into the reservoir it was possible by a gentle staircase, which was blocked by a lancet arch. =&lt;ref name="vestikavkaza.ru"/&gt;

Water came into the ovdan from a well-kept underground water pipe-kyhryza. The water intake structures of this water pipe were quite far from the city.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== In culture ==
Images of the Shirvanshahs palace can be found on the works of such artists as Grigory Gagarin, Georgy Hohenfelden, in the photographs of Richard Thiele. In 1990, the postage stamp of the USSR, dedicated to the palace, was issued. Later, the image of the palace appeared on the postage stamps of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Also, Shirvanshah's palace was depicted on an Azerbaijani banknote in face value of 10,000 manats. Description of the palace is found in the novel of [[Kurban Said]] [[Ali and Nino|"Ali and Nino.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.visions.az/en/news/860/11c61a56/|title=Visions of Azerbaijan Magazine ::: Azerbaijan in Prose|work=Visions of Azerbaijan Magazine|access-date=2018-06-06|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Palace complex in cinematography ===
The architecture of the palace several times fell into the footage of [[Leonid Gaidai]]'s film "[[The Diamond Arm|Brilliantovaya ruka]]", which was also filmed in the "old city" of Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.day.az/culture/727111.html|title=Приключения кинозвезд в Баку  – КАК СНИМАЛИ|date=13 December 2015|work=Day.Az|access-date=2018-06-06|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8087">'''Psychic distance''' is a perceived difference or distance between objects. The concept is used in [[aesthetics]], [[international business]] and marketing, and computer science.

Psychic distance is made up of the Greek word "psychikos – ψυχικός", an adjective referring to an individual's mind and [[soul]],&lt;ref&gt;Simpson and Weiner 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and "distance" which implies differences between two subjects or objects. Some therefore argue that the concept exists in the mind's eye of the individual and it is their subjective perception that uniquely determines "psychic distance".&lt;ref&gt;Sousa and Bradley 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As a result it is often viewed as a humanistic reflection of individual acuity and not a collective, organisational or societal perspective. However, in the international business context, psychic distance is frequently measured in terms of national averages&lt;ref&gt;Haakanson &amp; Ambos, Journal of International Management, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; or in terms of the national-level differences that influence those perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Dow &amp; Karunaratna, Journal of International Business Studies, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, King refers to his preference to use the term "aesthetic distance" rather than psychic distance, as he feels the latter term has misleading connotations in current usage.&lt;ref&gt;[1] Jerry P. King, ''The Art of Mathematics'', New York: Plenum, 1992, p.196&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics==

In 1912 [[Cambridge University|Cambridge's]] [[Edward Bullough]] wrote of it in a long paper entitled, ''Psychical Distance as a factor in Art and an Aesthetic Principle'' which appeared in the British Journal of Psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bullough, ''Psychical Distance as a factor in Art and an Aesthetic Principle'', British Journal of Psychology: 5 (1912), p87-118.&lt;/ref&gt; In this he set down in a reasonably complete manner the concept as it applied to the arts.

Evidently, he successfully influenced thinkers 50 years later. Donald Sherburne, for example, says, "Edward Bullough's psychical distance has become "a classic doctrine of aesthetic thinking."&lt;ref name=Sherburne&gt;Donald Sherburne, ''A Whiteheadean Aesthetic'', New York: Yale, 1961, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;  And James L. Jarrett writes of Bullough's ideas, "Perhaps no more influential idea has been introduced into modern aesthetics than that of psychical distance."&lt;ref name=Jarrett&gt;James L. Jarrett, ''The Quest for Beauty'', Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1957, p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychical distance construct has been used as an intercultural theme by the arts in the study of creative [[Emotional detachment|detachment]] between East and West.&lt;ref&gt;Odin 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such cameo appearances in other fields, the concept has been essentially "operationalised" by business with the marketing function acting as the chief curator.

==International business and marketing==

In international business (IB) and marketing settings, psychic distance is based on ''perceived'' differences between a home country and a "foreign" country regardless of physical time and space factors which differ across diverse cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Usunier and Lee ''Marketing across Cultures'', Essex, UK: Pearson Education, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It is a subjective type of distance ("perceived differences") unlike the distances forming the CAGE framework, for instance &lt;ref&gt;Ghemawat (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;. This makes psychic distance very difficult to measure, and often times fallacious proxies are used to estimate it (e.g., Kogut &amp; Singh (1988) index using Hofstede's (1980) cultural dimensions). More accurate approaches rely on asking decision-makers their perceptions towards different host countries (e.g., Hakanson &amp; Ambos, 2010), or using its antecedents to estimate it (psychic distance stimuli: Dow &amp; Karunaratna, 2006). 

The business origins of the "psychic distance" idiom can be traced back to research conducted by Beckerman (1956) and Linnemann (1966). As a fully formed concept Vahlne and Wiedersheim-Paul (1973) as cited by Nordstrom and Vahlne (1992) described psychic distance as "factors preventing or disturbing the flow of information between potential or actual suppliers and customers." These factors are associated with country-based diversities and dissimilarities and can be grouped into four clear areas:

#Linguistic differences and translation difficulty.
#Cultural factors – societal norms, level of individualism or collectivism, values and customs.
#Economic situation – existing trading links, infrastructure, local conditions, competition and investor confidence.
#Political and legal system – government stability and risk of instability, import tariffs, legal protection and taxation levels.

Although the concept was fully formed by the early 1970s, it was the study of [[Norway|Nordic]] [[multinational corporation|multinationals]] by Johanson and Vahlne (1977) which followed on from two earlier studies in 1975 and 1976, that is generally accepted as the concept's real genesis.&lt;ref&gt;Sousa and Bradley 2005b&lt;/ref&gt; The studies concluded that a firm's international activities relate directly to psychic distance and that further international expansion progresses into markets with successively greater psychic distance.

In summary, companies tend to initially export to countries that they understand; then build on their acquired experience to explore opportunities further afield. In other words, firms enter new markets where they are able to identify opportunities with low market uncertainty then enter markets at successively greater psychic distance.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson and Vahlne, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, contemporary literature on the internationalisation process cites psychic distance as a key variable and determinant for expansion into foreign markets.

== Other IB approaches to measuring psychic distance ==

The psychic distance has also on occasion been measured through formative indicators such as strong commercial relations, close political relations, historic ties, geographic ties, social ties, country information stock, level of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Psychic distance and Australian export market selection|last = Brewer|first = Paul|date = 2007|journal = Australian Journal of Management|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These indicators are deeply analyzed for the international market selection. The measurement of these indicators is best accomplished through an index construction. However, the formative indicators are very context dependent. If they were applied to different industries, countries and entry modes, the indicators would have shifted dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Developing a multidimesional instrument to measure psychic distance stimuli|last = Dow &amp; Karunaratna|first = |date = 2006|journal = Journal of International Business Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer science==

More recently, Gairola and Chong&lt;ref name=gairolachong&gt;Dhruv Gairola and Siang Yew Chong, "An Economics-Inspired Noise Model in Spatial Games with Reputation", Advances in Intelligent Modelling and Simulation: Artificial Intelligence-based Models and Techniques in Scalable Computing, Studies in Computational Intelligence, Springer Berlin/Heidelberg, vol. 422, pp. 271-293 (2012)  [http://www.springerlink.com/content/d6kj4p2348k01148/]&lt;/ref&gt; incorporated psychic distance to simulate more realistic noise models in spatial games, leading to interesting results, including a manifestation of the psychic distance paradox.

'''Radio Lagos 107.5 FM''' (also known as Tiwa n' Tiwa) began operations in 1977 as an offshoot of the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation. It is the first [[state-owned]] [[Frequency modulation|FM]] [[List of radio stations in Lagos|radio station]] in [[Lagos State]]

The station originally operated on two A.M. Frequencies (990&amp;nbsp;kHz.303mtrs and 918&amp;nbsp;kHz.327mtrs). The need for transformation produced Radio Lagos 107.5 FM (Tiwa n'Tiwa) under the control of the Lagos State Radio Service in 2001.

Radio Lagos is the first predominantly specialized, language station with over 98% of its transmission in [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and Egun, and approximately 2% for [[English language|English]] bulletins. The station target audience includes Yoruba speaking listeners in [[Lagos]] and [[Nigerian diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=RadioAfrican|title=Radio Lagos 107.5 Online|author=Haris Aslam|date=20 November 2014|url=http://www.radioafrican.com/radio-lagos-107-5-fm-online/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suger's Eagle''' (''Aigle de Suger'') is an [[Art of ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian]] [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] [[vase]] mounted in a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[silver-gilt]] eagle.{{sfn|Verdier|1990|p=13}} It is now displayed along with the [[French regalia]] in the [[Galerie d'Apollon]] at the [[Louvre]].{{sfn|Verdier|1990|p=23}}

The vase likely dates to the second century &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt;.{{sfn|Heckscher|1938|p=216 n. 3|ps=, citing [[Suger's_Eagle#CITEREFDelbrück1932|Delbrück 1932]], p. 203}} According to [[Suger]], abbot of [[Saint-Denis Abbey|Saint-Denis]], in his  ''De administratione'', he found, "lying idly in a chest for many years, an Egyptian porphyry vase admirably shaped and polished."{{sfn|Verdier|1990|p=13}} In his own words, he determined to adapt and transfer (''adaptavimus ... transferre'') it into a liturgical vessel "in the form of an eagle" (''in aquilae formam''), a symbol of Christ.{{sfn|Heckscher|1938|pp=216–17}} Suger's Eagle is a typical case of the "careful preservation of the ancient relic in a setting which leaves it completely intact."{{sfn|Heckscher|1938|pp=216–17}} On the bottom of the eagle is a [[niello]]ed ''[[Titulus (inscription)|titulus]]'': "This stone deserves to have mounts of gold and gems. / It was marble. Its settings are more precious than marble."{{sfn|Verdier|1990|p=13}} Inscribed around the base of the neck, above the lip of the vessel, is a dedication to the church of Saint-Denis.{{sfn|Heckscher|1938|pp=216–17}} The [[Goldsmith|goldwork]] of the neck demonstrates superb chiselwork.{{sfn|Stratford|1981|p=509}}

Two large engravings from 1706 depict the treasure of Saint-Denis (including the eagle vase) as it was then displayed, in a cabinet. Its popularity as a tourist attraction prevented the treasure's total destruction during the [[French Revolution]].{{sfn|Stratford|1991|pp=337–38}} The eagle and three of Suger's other liturgical vessels—Queen Eleanor's vase and King Roger's decanter, both of rock crystal, and a sardonyx ewer—ended up in the Galerie d'Apollon at the Louvre.{{sfn|Verdier|1990|p=23}}

'''Tank Man''' (also known as the '''Unknown Protester''' or '''Unknown Rebel''') is the nickname of an unidentified man who stood in front of a column of tanks on June 5, 1989, the morning after the [[People's Liberation Army at Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Chinese military had suppressed]] the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] by force. As the lead tank maneuvered to pass by the man, he repeatedly shifted his position in order to obstruct the tank's attempted path around him. The incident was filmed and smuggled out to a worldwide audience. Internationally, it is considered one of the most iconic images of all time.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/behind-the-scenes-tank-man-of-tiananmen/ | work=The New York Times | first=Patrick | last=Witty | title=Behind the Scenes: Tank Man of Tiananmen | date=June 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FloorSpeech"&gt;[[Joe Pitts|Pitts, Joe]].

 | last = Corless | first = Kieron | title = Time In – Plugged In – Tank Man | magazine= Time Out | date = May 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside China, the image and the events leading up were subject to heavy state censorship, and as a result they are being forgotten.

There is no reliable information about the identity or fate of the man; the story of what happened to the tank crew is also unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SACHK-W4o1E&amp;t=4m28s |title=Photographer Jeff Widener |work=BBC interview |date=2014|edition= Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At least one witness has stated that "Tank Man" was not the only person who had opposed the tanks during the protest.  Shao Jiang, who was a student leader, said: "I witnessed a lot of the people standing up, blocking the tanks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1UUS1ZGAi4&amp;t=1m22s |title=Shao Jiang interview |work=Amnesty International|edition= Video posted for 25th anniversary|accessdate= May 28, 2014 }} Those interviewed include photographer Stuart Franklin with ''Magnum'' for TIME, who was on the 5th floor balcony of the Beijing Hotel.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tank Man is unique in that he is the only one who was photographed and recorded on video.

==Incident==
The incident took place at the north edge of [[Tiananmen Square]], along [[Chang'an Avenue]], on June 5, 1989, two days after the Chinese government's violent crackdown on the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Makinen |first=Julie |date=4 June 2014 |title=Tiananmen Square mystery: Who was 'Tank Man'? |url=http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-china-tiananmen-square-tank-man-20140603-story.html |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=16 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The man stood in the middle of the wide avenue, directly in the path of a column of approaching [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] tanks. Stuart Franklin, who was on assignment for ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine, told the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]],'' "At some point, shots were fired and the tanks carried on down the road toward us, leaving Tiananmen Square behind, until blocked by a lone protester."&lt;ref name="bare_url"/&gt; He wore a white shirt and black trousers, and he held two shopping bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Langely|first=Andrew|title=Tiananmen Square: Massacre Crushes China's Democracy Movement|publisher=Compass Point Books|year=2009|page=45|isbn=978-0-7565-4101-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the tanks came to a stop, the man gestured towards the tanks with one of the bags. In response, the lead tank attempted to drive around the man, but the man repeatedly stepped into the path of the tank in a show of [[nonviolent action]].&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988169,00.html The Unknown Rebel] ''Time'' Magazine profile, 13 April 1998. Retrieved 10 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; After repeatedly attempting to go around rather than crush the man, the lead tank stopped its engines, and the armored vehicles behind it seemed to follow suit. There was a short pause with the man and the tanks having reached a quiet, still impasse.

Having successfully brought the column to a halt, the man climbed onto the hull of the buttoned-up lead tank and, after briefly stopping at the driver's hatch, appeared in video footage of the incident to call into various ports in the tank's turret. He then climbed atop the turret and seemed to have a short conversation with a crew member at the gunner's hatch. After ending the conversation, the man descended from the tank. The tank commander briefly emerged from his hatch, and the tanks restarted their engines, ready to continue on.  At that point, the man, who was still standing within a meter or two from the side of the lead tank, leapt in front of the vehicle once again and quickly re-established the man–tank standoff.

Video footage shows two figures in blue pulling the man away and disappearing with him into a nearby crowd; the tanks continued on their way.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; Eyewitnesses are unsure who pulled him aside. [[Charlie Cole (photographer)|Charlie Cole]], who was there for ''[[Newsweek]]'', said it was the Chinese government [[Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau|PSB]] (the police),&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4313282.stm Picture Power:Tiananmen Standoff] BBC News. Last updated October 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Jan Wong]], who was there for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', thought that the men who pulled him away were concerned bystanders. In April 1998, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' included the "Unknown Rebel" in a feature titled "[[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Iyer |first=Pico |title=The Unknown Rebel |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988169,00.html |journal=Time |date=13 April 1998 |access-date=16 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' included Jeff Widener's photograph in "Time 100: The Most Influential Images of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Time 100: The Most Influential Images of All Time |url=http://100photos.time.com|journal=Time |date=6 November 2016 |access-date=19 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity and fate==
Little is publicly known of the man's identity or that of the commander of the lead tank. Shortly after the incident, the British tabloid ''[[Sunday Express]]'' named him as '''Wang Weilin''' ({{lang|zh-hans|王维林}}), a 19-year-old student&lt;ref&gt;"[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-03/news/mn-819_1_man-tank-pictures Man who defied tanks may be dead]", ''[[Los Angeles Times]],'' June 3, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; who was later charged with "political hooliganism" and "attempting to subvert members of the [[People's Liberation Army]]."&lt;ref&gt;Munro, Robin; Spiegel, Mickey (1994). ''Detained in China and Tibet: a directory of political and religious prisoners''. Asia Watch Committee. p. 194. {{ISBN|978-1-56432-105-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this claim has been rejected by internal [[Communist Party of China]] documents, which reported that they could not find the man, according to the Hong Kong-based [[Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy|Information Center for Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=times30&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6390782.ece|title=Identity of Tank Man of Tiananmen Square remains a mystery |last=Macartney|first=Jane|date=May 30, 2009|work=The Times |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; One party member was quoted as saying, "We can’t find him. We got his name from journalists. We have checked through computers but can’t find him among the dead or among those in prison."&lt;ref name=times30/&gt; Numerous theories have sprung up as to the man's identity and current whereabouts.&lt;ref name="Wang Weilin by tank file"&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://appledaily.atnext.com/template/apple/art_main.cfm?iss_id=20060602&amp;sec_id=4104&amp;subsec_id=11866&amp;art_id=5986243 Wang Weilin by tank file], ''Apple Daily'', June 2, 2006, p. A1. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221173327/http://appledaily.atnext.com/template/apple/art_main.cfm?iss_id=20060602&amp;sec_id=4104&amp;subsec_id=11866&amp;art_id=5986243 |date=February 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several conflicting stories about what happened to him after the demonstration. In a speech to the President's Club in 1999, [[Bruce Herschensohn]], former deputy special assistant to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]], reported that he was [[Execution (legal)|executed]] 14 days later; other sources say he was executed by [[firing squad]] a few months after the Tiananmen Square protests.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; In ''[[Red China Blues: My Long March from Mao to Now]]'', [[Jan Wong]] writes that she believes from her interactions with the government press that they have "no idea who he was either" and that he's still alive somewhere on the mainland. Another theory is that he escaped to [[Taiwan]] and remains employed there as an archaeologist in the [[National Palace Museum]]. This was first reported by the [[Yonhap|Yonhap news agency]] in [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/tiananmen-square-what-happened-to-tank-man-9483398.html|title=Tiananmen Square 25th anniversary: What happened to Tank Man?|date=2014-06-04|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[government of the People's Republic of China]] has made few statements about the incident or the people involved. In a 1990 interview with [[Barbara Walters]], then-[[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|CPC General Secretary]] [[Jiang Zemin]] was asked what became of the man. Jiang first stated (through an interpreter), "I can't confirm whether this young man you mentioned was arrested or not," and then replied in English, "I think never killed"{{sic}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/etc/transcript.html|title=''Frontline'': ''The Tank Man'' transcript|accessdate=June 30, 2008|date=April 11, 2006|work=Frontline|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also argued that the incident evidenced the "humanity" of the country's military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Higgins|first=Andrew|title=Tycoon prods Taiwan closer to China|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/tycoon-prods-taiwan-closer-to-china/2012/01/20/gIQAhswmFQ_story.html|accessdate=January 31, 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2000 interview with [[Mike Wallace]], [[Jiang Zemin]] said, "He was never arrested." He then stated, "I don't know where he is now." He also emphasized that the tank stopped and did not run the young man down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/chinas-leader-talks-to-60-minutes/|title=China's Leader Talks To 60 Minutes|date=August 31, 2000|work=cbsnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International notability and censorship==

At the extreme left is an intersection with traffic lights]]
Internationally, the image of the lone man in front of the tank has come to symbolize the events at Tiananmen Square in 1989&lt;ref name=times30/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTNewPhoto"/&gt; and is widely considered one of the most iconic images of all time.&lt;ref name="bare_url"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FloorSpeech"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Corless2006"/&gt;

A [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] interview of six experts noted that the memory of the Tiananmen Square protests appears to have faded in China, especially among younger Chinese people, due to government censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/themes/legacy.html|title=Legacy of June Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images of the protest on the Internet have been [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|censored in China]].&lt;ref name=times30/&gt; When undergraduate students at Peking University, which was at the center of the incident, were shown copies of the iconic photograph 16 years afterwards, they were "genuinely mystified."&lt;ref name=frontlineinterview&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/interviews/wong.html|title=The Tank Man: Interview: Jan Wong |accessdate=August 12, 2010|date=April 11, 2006|work=Frontline|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the students said that the image was "artwork." It is noted in the documentary ''[[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]]: The Tank Man'' that he whispered to the student next to him "89," which led the interviewer to surmise that the student may have concealed his knowledge of the event.

It has been suggested that the "Unknown Rebel," if still alive, never made himself known as he is unaware of his international recognition due to Chinese media suppression of events relating to government protest.&lt;ref name=times30/&gt;

At and after the events in the square, the PSB treated members of the international press roughly, confiscating and destroying all the film they could find, and forced the signing of confessions to offences such as photography during martial law, punishable by long imprisonment.&lt;ref name="BBCnews"/&gt;

==Photographic versions==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TankMan.JPG|thumb|300px|"Tank Man", far off in the background to the left of the leader, prepares to face down the row of incoming tanks. This photograph, taken by Terril Jones, was only released in 2009.]] --&gt;

Five photographers (one of whom did not share his material for 20 years) managed to capture the event on film that was not later confiscated by the PSB.&lt;ref name="NYTimeretrospect"&gt;Witty, Patrick (June 3, 2009). [http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/behind-the-scenes-tank-man-of-tiananmen/ Behind the Scenes: Tank Man of Tiananmen], ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; On June 4, 2009, the fifth photographer released an image of the scene taken from ground level.&lt;ref name="NYTNewPhoto"&gt;Witty, Patrick (June 4, 2009). [http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/behind-the-scenes-a-new-angle-on-history/?hp Behind the Scenes: A New Angle on History] ''[[The New York Times]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

The widest coverage of the event and one of the best-known photographs of the event appearing in both ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazines, was documented by [[Stuart Franklin]]. He was on the same balcony as [[Charlie Cole (photographer)|Charlie Cole]], and his roll of film was smuggled out of the country by a French student, concealed in a box of tea.&lt;ref name="NYTimeretrospect" /&gt;

The most-used photograph of the event was taken by [[Jeff Widener]] of the [[Associated Press]], from a sixth-floor balcony of the [[Beijing Hotel]], about half a mile (800&amp;nbsp;meters) away from the scene. Widener was injured and suffering from the flu. The image was taken using a [[Nikon FE2]] camera through a Nikkor [[Telephoto lens|400mm 5.6 ED-IF lens]] and [[Nikon TC-301|TC-301]] teleconverter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/06/02/world/main5057008.shtml|title="Tank Man": The Picture That Almost Wasn't|last=Alfano |first=Sean |date=June 4, 2009|publisher=[[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Widener running out of film, a friend (by the name of Kirk)  hastily obtained a roll of Fuji 100 ASA color negative film, allowing him to make the shot.&lt;ref name="bare_url"/&gt; Though he was concerned that his shots were no good, his image was syndicated to many newspapers around the world&lt;ref name="NYTimeretrospect" /&gt; and was said to have appeared on the front page of all European papers.&lt;ref name="urlNew York Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/behind-the-scenes-tank-man-of-tiananmen/ |title=Behind the Scenes: Tank Man of Tiananmen |author=Patrick Witty |date=June 3, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5shP0U7jv?url=http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/behind-the-scenes-tank-man-of-tiananmen/ |archivedate=September 12, 2010 |accessdate=September 12, 2010 |work=The New York Times |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also nominated for the Pulitzer prize but did not win. Nevertheless, his photograph has widely been known as one of the most iconic photographs of all time.&lt;ref name="bare_url"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FloorSpeech"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Corless2006"/&gt;

Charlie Cole, working for ''[[Newsweek]]'' and on the same balcony as Stuart Franklin, hid his roll of film containing Tank Man in a Beijing Hotel toilet, sacrificing an unused roll of film and undeveloped images of wounded protesters after the [[Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau|PSB]] raided his room, destroyed the two aforementioned rolls of film and forced him to sign a confession to photography during martial law, an imprisonable offence. Cole was able to retrieve the roll and have it sent to ''Newsweek''.&lt;ref name="NYTimeretrospect" /&gt; He was awarded the 1990 [[World Press Photo]] of the Year&lt;ref name="WorldPressPhoto"&gt;[https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/1990/world-press-photo-year/charlie-cole] World Press Photo&lt;/ref&gt; and the picture was featured in ''Life''{{'s}} "[[100 Photographs that Changed the World|100 Photographs That Changed the World]]" in 2003.

On June 4, 2009, in connection with the 20th anniversary of the protests, Associated Press reporter, Terril Jones, revealed a photo he had taken showing the Tank Man from ground level, a different angle from all of the other known photos of the Tank Man. Jones wrote that he was not aware of what he had captured until a month later when printing his photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Terril|year=2009|title=Tank Man|journal=Pomona College Magazine|volume=41|issue=1 |url=http://pomona.edu/Magazine/PCMFL09/FStankman.shtml|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306041054/http://pomona.edu/Magazine/PCMFL09/FStankman.shtml|archivedate=March 6, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Tsang Hin Wah of [[Reuters]] took several shots from room 1111 of the Beijing Hotel,&lt;ref name="HKPPA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://translate.google.com.hk/translate?hl=zh-TW&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=zh-CN&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://thehousenews.com/society/%25E5%259B%259E%25E5%2588%25B0%25E5%25A1%25B5%25E5%259C%259F%25E4%25BA%25BA%25E9%2596%2593-%25E6%259B%25BE%25E9%25A1%25AF%25E8%258F%25AF%25E8%25A8%25AA%25E8%25AB%2587/|title=Arthur Tsang Hin Wah interview, March 20, 2013|work=google.com.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; but only the shot of Tank Man climbing the tank was chosen.&lt;ref name="NYTimeretrospect" /&gt; It was not until several hours later that the photo of the man standing in front of the tank was finally chosen. When the staff noticed Widener's work, they re-checked Tsang's negative to see if it was of the same moment as Widener's. On March 20, 2013, in an interview by the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association (HKPPA), Wah told the story and added further detail. He told HKPPA that on the night of June 3, 1989, he was beaten by students while taking photos and was bleeding. A "foreign" photographer accompanying him suddenly said, "I am not gonna die for your country," and left. Wah returned to the hotel. When he decided to go out again, the [[Chinese public security bureau|public security]] stopped him, so he stayed in his room, stood next to the window and eventually witnessed the Tank Man and took several shots of the event.&lt;ref name="HKPPA" /&gt;

In addition to the photography, video footage of the scene was recorded and transmitted across the globe. [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) cameraman [[Willie Phua]], [[CNN]] cameraman Jonathan Schaer and [[NBC]] cameraman Tony Wasserman appear to be the only television cameramen who captured the scene.&lt;ref name="Shooting the 'tank man' of Tiananmen Square"&gt;{{cite web|title=Capturing Asia|url=http://www.bobwurth.com/capturing-asia.html|website=Books and Essays by Bob Wurth on the Asia Pacific Region|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Willie Phua 7.30 report ABC"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkck39jSV-M&amp;t=4m51s Willie Phua on Australia Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) 7.30 Report].

After seeing Chinese tanks crush vehicles and people on June 3, many journalists and photographers believed the protests had already reached their peak, causing many to leave the area before the "tank man" incident occurred.&lt;ref name="BBCnews"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4313282.stm Picture Power: Tiananmen Standoff].

==Legacy==
In [[Tom Clancy]]'s 2000 novel ''[[The Bear and the Dragon]]'', the Chinese authorities apprehend and execute Tank Man, then bill the surviving family for the cost of the pistol round expended to shoot him in the back of the head.

A similar scene is depicted in the music video for ''[[Club Foot (song)|Club Foot]]'' (2004) by the English rock band [[Kasabian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/91923534 |author=Kasabian |title=Club Foot feat. Dinara Drukarova|website=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tank Man is briefly referenced in the 2007 film ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]''.

The music video for "[[Refuse/Resist]]" by the thrash/death metal band [[Sepultura]] features brief footage of the Tank Man.

A fictionalized version of the fates of both the Tank Man and a soldier in the tank is told in [[Lucy Kirkwood]]'s 2013 play ''[[Chimerica (play)|Chimerica]]'', which premiered at the Almeida Theatre from May 20, 2013 to July 6, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hitchings|first=Henry|title=Chimerica, Almeida Theatre – theatre review |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/theatre/chimerica-almeida-theatre--theatre-review-8635490.html|accessdate=June 16, 2015|work=London Evening Standard|date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 2013, [[Sina Weibo]], China's most popular microblog, blocked terms whose English translations are "today", "tonight", "[[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|June 4]]", and "big yellow duck". If these were searched for, a message appeared stating that, in accordance with relevant laws, statutes, and policies, the results of the search could not be shown. The censorship occurred because a [[Photo manipulation#Photoshopping|photoshopped]] version of Tank Man, in which [[rubber ducks]] replaced the tanks, had been circulating around [[Twitter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Didi Kirsten Tatlow|title=Censored in China: ‘Today,’ ‘Tonight’ and ‘Big Yellow Duck’|url=http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/censored-in-china-today-tonight-and-big-yellow-duck/|work=International New York Times IHT Rendezvous|date=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a reference to [[Florentijn Hofman]]'s [[Rubber Duck (sculpture)|''Rubber Duck'']] sculpture, which at that time was floating in Hong Kong's [[Victoria Harbour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/06/04/fools-errand-why-china-censors-rubber-duckies-on-tiananmen-anniversary/|date=June 4, 2013|title=Fool's Errand: Why China Censors Rubber Duckies On Tiananmen Anniversary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Footage of Tank Man is included in the 2014 film adaptation of [[Lois Lowry|Lowis Lowry]]'s ''[[The Giver]]'', during a montage intended to give the protagonist strength.

A 2017 novel published by Random House Mondadori, [https://www.penguinrandomhousegrupoeditorial.com/foreign-rights-catalogue/la-quimera-del-hombre-tanque/ La quimera del Hombre Tanque] fictionalizes a second, hypothetical encounter between the two protagonists of the iconic photo of 1989. Aiming at social reconciliation, a group of Chinese leaders tries to broadcast on TV, a quarter of a century after the incident, a peaceful encounter between Tank Man and the tank commander.&lt;ref&gt;Víctor Sombra, Barcelona 2017 {{ISBN|978-84-3973292-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cordoba-teatrolibertador.JPG|thumb|240px|Libertador San Martín Theatre]]
[[File:Teatro Libertador, Córdoba (interior).jpg|thumb|240px|View of the concert hall]]
The '''Teatro del Libertador General San Martín''' (or more commonly, '''Teatro del Libertador''' or '''Teatro Libertador''') is the premier stage [[theatre]], [[opera house]] and [[concert hall]] in [[Córdoba, Argentina]].

==Overview==
Noting the absence of a concert hall in his native Córdoba, Provincial Justice Minister [[Ramón J. Cárcano]] proposed the establishment of one to Governor [[Ambrosio Olmos]] in 1887. Securing the project's approval and funding from the Córdoba Legislature, Cárcano commissioned a fellow [[Italian Argentine]], architect [[Francesco Tamburini]], for the project's design. Creating an eclectic [[Italianate]] theatre, Tamburini's design was juxtaposed with Arturo Nembrini Gonzaga's interior [[verdigris]] accents, façade [[reliefs]] and [[quadriga]], all nods to the [[Beaux Arts architecture]] so in demand in Argentina at the time. The entirety of the theatre's materials, fabrics and machinery was imported for the purpose from [[Europe]].

The landmark institution was inaugurated on April 26, 1891, as the Rivera Indarte Theatre. Popularly known as the ''Teatro de la Calle Ancha'' ("Broad Street Theatre") during the early 20th century (Broad Street was later renamed [[Dalmacio Vélez Sársfield|Vélez Sársfield]] Avenue), the grand concert hall was designed for a capacity of 1,000 spectators. Its concert hall featured a rising floor to stage level, made available during the many social balls held there since then. Among the first prominent drama theatre directors to stage productions there was [[María Guerrero]], who popularized the [[Spanish literature|theatre of Spain]] in Argentina after 1897. Subsequent years saw numerous internationally renowned classical performers, as well, notably [[Enrico Caruso]], [[Titta Ruffo]], [[Tito Schipa]] and [[Arthur Rubinstein]].

The theatre additionally houses the Luis de Tejeda and Rafael Grisolía halls, each with capacities of around 100 and mainly reserved for seminars, as well as for the theatre's Youth Orchestra. A museum of the institution's extensive [[stagecraft]] collection was organized into the Cristóbal de Aguilar Musical and Theatre Museum in 1970.

The institution was renamed in honor of General [[José de San Martín]] in 1950 by order of President [[Juan Perón]] on the occasion of the centennial of the Liberator's death. It was renamed ''Rivera Indarte'' in 1956 (following Perón's overthrow), and regained the San Martín denomination in 1973.

'''''The Abandoned Soldier''''' is a sculpture created in 2007 by sculptor James Napier that was modelled after British ex-soldier Lance Corporal Daniel Twiddy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-25/edition-1/big-picture-abandoned-soldier]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The sculpture ''The Abandoned Soldier'' (TAS) was made for the [[BBC]] documentary ''Power to the People'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/power_to_the_people/6613759.stm Power To The People: The Battle of Trafalgar Square] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; to be erected in Trafalgar Square, and made an appearance on Newsnight as well as the front page of the Independent newspaper. TAS was initially housed at [[Combat Stress]], a charitable organisation for ex-servicemen and women, before being moved with the help of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers to the [[National Memorial Arboretum]] in Staffordshire to launch The Abandoned Soldier Project. The sculpture has subsequently been moved to Cardiff Castle, then to Exeter Castle for the War Art Exhibition in June 2011, and was filmed as part of a Channel 5 documentary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.welshicons.org.uk/news/cardiff/cardiff-castle-welcomes-the-abandoned-soldier/ Cardiff Castle Welcomes The Abandoned Soldier] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121224155540/http://www.welshicons.org.uk/news/cardiff/cardiff-castle-welcomes-the-abandoned-soldier/ |date=2012-12-24 }} WelshIcons.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cardiffian.jomec.co.uk/article/forgotten-soldier-statue-erected-cardiff-castle Forgotten soldier statue erected by Cardiff Castle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131225935/http://cardiffian.jomec.co.uk/article/forgotten-soldier-statue-erected-cardiff-castle |date=2012-01-31 }} The Cardiffian&lt;/ref&gt; From there it was moved to the Rhondda Heritage Park at [[Trehafod]]. 

In April 2012, the sculpture was moved back to Cardiff Castle as a permanent 'base'. In the Summer of 2013, the head piece was removed from the base and taken on a tour of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/100933196@N03/sets/72157649153200768/]&lt;/ref&gt; The high points included; The summit of Mount Snowdon and Portmeirion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69WD1zeCcXU]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014 the sculpture was part of an installation by Themis Jones, installed at the Hay Festival of Literature and Art. In July 2014 he returned to his main 'base' at Cardiff Castle and will stand as a lasting reminder of the trauma of War, until 2018.

==Interpretation==
The statue was created in remembrance of soldiers who have suffered the after effects of armed conflict and are not being treated like the heroes they truly are.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-15533875 Garden of remembrance at heritage park to fallen troops] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture was modelled after Lance Corporal Daniel Twiddy, who had been wounded in 2003 by friendly fire and shrapnel while in [[Basra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cavgds.co.uk/assets/89/March_09_Newsletter.pdf The Abandoned Soldier] The Cavalry and Guards Club, 127 Newsletter, March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2011/02/12/sculpture-tribute-to-soldiers-hardship-91466-28158852/ Sculpture tribute to soldiers’ hardship] Wales Online&lt;/ref&gt; Twiddy had received several wounds from shrapnel, which included wounds to the face from a 'Blue on Blue' incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5034672.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rctbusinessclub.co.uk/7820.html Rhondda Heritage Park’s Garden of Remembrance 2011] Rhondda Heritage Business Club&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
In 2010 concerns were made over the stability of the sculpture and that the resin material might disintegrate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/memorial-sculpture-at-risk-of-crumbling-away-2133550.html Memorial sculpture at risk of crumbling away] Independent&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns were also raised about the sculpture's lack of a permanent display location. There have been attempts at petitioning for a more permanent location as well as fundraising efforts for a bronze version of the statue.

The sculpture now has a piece of music, commissioned by the TAS Project, written and sung by Bethan Myfanwy Hughes, a civilian trauma nurse and also a member of the Territorial Army.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR-zgFcaE4U]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner 012.jpg|thumb|300px|Painting held by the Cleveland Museum of Art]]

'''''The Burning of the Houses of Lords and Commons''''' is the title of two oil on canvas paintings by [[J. M. W. Turner]], depicting the fire that broke out at the [[Houses of Parliament]] on the evening of 16 October 1834.

Along with thousands of other spectators, Turner himself witnessed the [[Burning of Parliament]] from the south bank of the [[River Thames]], opposite [[Westminster]].  He made sketches using both pencil and watercolour in two sketchbooks from different vantage points, including from a rented boat, although it is unclear that the sketches were made instantly, ''[[en plein air]]''.  The sketchbooks were left by Turner to the [[National Gallery]] as part of the [[Turner Bequest]] and are now held by the [[Tate Gallery]].  Some other sketches in Turner's sketchbooks, previously thought to also show the Burning of Parliament, have been reassessed and may be sketches of the fire that destroyed the Grand Storehouse at the [[Tower of London]] on 30 October 1841.

The paintings were made in late 1834 or early 1835 and both measure {{convert|92.1|cm}} by {{convert|123.2|cm}}.  Turner spent many hours reworking both paintings on the [[varnishing day]] immediately before the exhibition opened to the public.

The first painting, exhibited at the [[British Institution]] in February 1835, shows the Houses of Parliament from the upstream side of [[Westminster Bridge]].  The buildings on the other side of the river are wreathed in golden flames.  The fire is consuming the chamber of the House of Commons in [[St Stephen's Chapel|St Stephen's Hall]], and illuminating the towers of [[Westminster Abbey]].  The fire reflects dull red in the water, with a crowd of spectators in the foreground.  To the right of the painting, Westminster Bridge looms like an iceberg, larger than life, but the perspective of the part of the bridge closest to the far bank is strongly distorted where it is lit up by the flames.  The painting was acquired by the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] in 1928 as part of the [[John Howard McFadden]] Collection.

The second painting was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]]'s [[Royal Academy summer exhibition|summer exhibition]] later in 1835.  It shows a similar scene from further downstream, closer to [[Waterloo Bridge]], with the flames and smoke blown dramatically over the Thames as spectators on the river bank and in boats look on.  This painting was acquired by the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] in 1942 as a bequest from [[John L. Severance]] (son of oil magnate [[Louis Severance]]).

The colours and composition of these paintings may have influenced Turner's conception of his 1839 painting ''[[The Fighting Temeraire]]'', which also depicts the passing of an old order.

'''''The Fifth Plague of Egypt''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Romanticism|Romantic]] English artist [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]] currently in the permanent collection at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]. Despite its title, it depicts [[Moses]] cursing the Egyptians with a plague of hail and fire, known as the seventh plague.

==Description==
In the foreground, two dead horses and a dead man are piled together, casualties of the earlier plague of pestilence in livestock. To the right, Moses stands with his arms outstretched, cursing the Egyptians with a plague of hail and fire, far away from the engulfed city. In the background, tumultuous clouds swirl above the Egyptian city, which is denoted by the gleaming, white [[pyramid]] in the centre of the canvas. Thin, horizontal lines fall from the clouds, showing streaks of hail falling from the sky. The painting is dominated with dark, neutral tones, creating the feeling of gloom.

Although the painting would be categorised as a [[history painting]] for its display of a biblical scene, the painting comes across as a [[landscape painting]], clearly demonstrating Turner's training in landscapes. The sky and the scenery take precedence over the figure of Moses and his actions, instead turning him into part of the landscape. The painting shows the force of nature as a more important factor than the force of man, which is minuscule.

==Historical information==
Turner describes the seventh [[Plagues of Egypt|plague of Egypt]] that God cursed upon the Egyptians for punishment of not releasing the Israelites from slavery, as described in the [[Old Testament]] [[Book of Exodus]], 9:13–35. Turner possibly mislabelled this painting as the wrong plague when he submitted it, but the title has not changed.

Turner submitted this large-scale painting to the annual [[Royal Academy]] exhibition in London in 1800. The twenty-four-year-old Turner was eager to impress the London art critics, with the largest canvas submitted by a young artist. He attempted to show his virtuosity as a history painter, even when his landscape painting background is entirely evident.&lt;ref name="Plague"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fifth Plague of Egypt|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/collections/artwork/fifth-plague-egypt-joseph-mallord-william-turner|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner had only been accepted into the Royal Academy as an Associate Member in 1799, and was eager to show his place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turner, J.

===Acquisition===
The painting was purchased from Turner by William Beckford in April 1800. Henry Jeffrey purchased the painting in 1807, before selling it to Thomas Tutor. George Young acquired the painting by 1853, and it was at sale at Christies in London in 1866. The painting was purchased by Earl Grosvenor in 1866 and stayed in his possession until at least 1871. In 1876, the painting was bought by Sir Francis Cook, where the painting stayed until 1951. It was sold to Sir Alexander Corda by the Cook family. John Mitchell bought the painting in 1955; the IMA purchased the painting in the same year from Mitchell with funds from the Lilly family.&lt;ref name="Plague" /&gt;

'''''The Sacrament of the Last Supper''''' is a painting by [[Salvador Dalí]]. Completed in 1955, after nine months of work, it remains one of his most popular compositions. Since its arrival at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1955, it replaced [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]'s ''[[A Girl with a Watering Can]]'' as the most popular piece in the museum.

==Background==
''The Sacrament of the Last Supper'' was completed during Dalí's post-World War II era, which is characterized by his increased interest in science, optical illusion and religion. During this time he became a devout Catholic and simultaneously was astonished by the "[[atomic age]]". Dalí himself labelled this era in his work "Nuclear [[Christian mysticism|Mysticism]]". He sought out to combine traditional Christian iconography with images of disintegration. This is especially apparent in his piece ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]]'', which was completed six years earlier.

The painting wasn't commissioned. After purchasing the [[Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)|''Crucifixion'']] and then giving it to the Metropolitan, collector and banker Chester Dale told Dalí he "had to do one more religious picture". In a paragraph in the National Gallery's curatorial file but missing from all published accounts, Dalí wrote of this picture:

{{quote|text=The first Holy Communion on Earth is conceived as a sacred rite of the greatest happiness for humanity. This rite is expressed with plastic means and not with literary ones. My ambition was to incorporate to [[Francisco de Zurbarán|Zurbarán]]'s mystical realism the experimental creativeness of modern painting in my desire to make it classic|sign=Salvador Dalí|source=A new look at Dalí's ''Sacrament''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicherald.com/stories/A-new-look-at-Dalis-Sacrament,14031|title=A new look at Dali’s ''Sacrament''- ''Arlington Catholic Herald''|first=Catholic|last=Herald|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Description==
''The Sacrament of the Last Supper'' depicts thirteen figures gathered around a table. Assuming this painting is in line with traditional symbolism the figures are Christ and his 12 Apostles. Christ is the centre figure in the painting placed directly on the horizon line. Directly behind him on the intersection point of perspective rests the source of sunlight making the Christ figure the focus of the painting. He points upward directing the viewer’s attention to a dominating transparent torso with arms stretched outward spanning the width of the picture plane. The scene’s setting is within a transparent dodecahedron or twelve-sided space as perceived in the pentagon-shaped windowpanes behind the table. In the background is a familiar landscape of Catalonia, which Dalí has included in his paintings numerous times, one example being his famous painting ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]''.

==Symbolism and interpretations==
The combination of a classic [[Christianity|Christian]] theme with the jarring techniques of [[surrealism]] captures the eye, as Dalí was able to do repeatedly with such works as ''[[The Temptation of St. Anthony (Dalí)|The Temptation of St. Anthony]]'', ''[[Christ of Saint John of the Cross]]'', ''[[Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)]]'', ''[[Nuclear Cross]]'', and ''[[The Ecumenical Council (painting)|The Ecumenical Council]]'', among others. The dimensions of the painting are in the [[golden ratio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plus.maths.org/content/golden-ratio-and-aesthetics|title=The golden ratio and aesthetics - plus.maths.org|last= Livio|first=Mario|authorlink=Mario Livio|date=November 1, 2002|website=plus.maths.org|accessdate=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the [[dodecahedron]] in the background. Dalí is quoted as saying that "the Communion must be symmetrical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Livio|first=Mario|year=2002|title=The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi, The World's Most Astonishing Number|publisher=[[Random House|Broadway Books]]|location=New York|isbn=0-7679-0815-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9dmPwAACAAJ|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many interpretations of this painting, but some critics have dismissed the piece, with the Protestant theologian [[Paul Tillich]] even calling it “junk”.&lt;ref&gt;''Time'', November 19, 1956, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Anthony Novak, a Catholic theologian, presented a paper on the subject of this piece in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20100611213420/http://ethicscenter.nd.edu/archives/documents/Novak.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He proposes that Dalí’s intention was not simply to paint the event of the last supper. He later stated:

{{quote|text=Dalí's true intention, which he has masterfully accomplished on this canvas, is to remind us of what is occurring in every celebration of this mystery of bread and wine: that the worship here on Earth makes present the realities of worship in Heaven.|sign=Novak|source=Misunderstood Masterpiece&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americamagazine.org/issue/misunderstood-masterpiece|title=Misunderstood Masterpiece: Salvador Dali's 'The Sacrament of the Last Supper'|date=5 November 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other critics, like Novak, say, by looking at the title, the focus is not placed on one evening two thousand years ago. The lack of individualization of the apostles, their lack of focus on Christ and the almost dematerialized Christ reaches beyond the fact of the event. Some say because Christ points to himself and the floating torso above him it could possibly be that he is referring to himself as his spirit has already ascended to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trinitycollegechapel.com/media/filestore/sermons/BrownLastSupper250207.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Through and through''' describes a situation where an object, real or imaginary, passes completely through another object, also real or imaginary. The phrase has several common uses:

==Forensics==
'''Through and through''' is used in [[forensics]] to describe a bullet that has passed through a body, leaving both entry and exit wounds [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16258297 Example.].

==Printmaking==
An image may be '''through and through''' in the following cases:
*ink or paint has penetrated to the other side
*inlaying with another material, [[stained glass]], [[patchwork]], [[woodworking|woodwork]], [[linoleum]], [[marble]], etc.
*[[Wikt:carving|carving]] out (e.g. [[wood carving]]), cutting out, [[perforation]]: this may concern the outside [[shape]], shaped [[Punchhole|hole]]s, and patterns of holes (e.g. in a [[punched card]]; also a [[passport]] may have its number perforated in the pages, to make [[forgery]] more difficult).
*[[embroidery]] etc.

Through and through images are more durable; they do not easily wear off.

In the case that the image can be viewed from the other side, we see the [[mirror image]], just like in the case of a [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] image, such as a drawing on a transparent sheet.

A sheet with a through and through image is [[Chirality (mathematics)|achiral]]. We can distinguish two cases:
*the sheet surface with the image has no axis of [[symmetry]] parallel to the axis of rotation – the two sides are the same (e.g. U on a page rotated L–R)
*the sheet surface with the image has an axis of symmetry parallel to the axis of rotation – the two sides are different (e.g. C on a page rotated L–R)

==Founder==
{{main|Charles E. Tuttle}}

The company’s founder, Charles Egbert Tuttle, Jr., was a graduate of [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="Ingleton1993"/&gt; He enlisted in the U.S. military and was stationed in Japan immediately after World War II, working on General [[Douglas MacArthur]]’s staff. His job, among other things, was to help revive the Japanese publishing industry after the war.&lt;ref name="Ingleton1993"/&gt; After his military service was completed, he decided to stay on in Japan and set up his own business importing English-language books and magazines and exporting rare Japanese antiquarian books to U.S. libraries.

Tuttle came from a distinguished New England publishing family.&lt;ref name="Ingleton1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards2006"&gt;Edwards, B. (2006): [http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060720/NEWS/607200385/1002/NEWS01 Used book shop closes its doors] ''Rutland Herald'' (July 20, 2006). Retrieved on April 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His father ran Tuttle Antiquarian Books{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}—one of several Tuttle companies in Rutland, Vermont, that had been involved with printing and publishing since the 1830s. At university, he studied American history and literature.&lt;ref name="Ingleton1993"/&gt; After graduating in 1937, he worked in the library of [[Columbia University]] for a year, then joined the family business.&lt;ref name="Ingleton1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saxon1993"/&gt; His interest in publishing 'quality' books about Japan and Asia, and his keen eye for design and editorial matters as a publisher, grew out of an appreciation for the valuable antiquarian books that he dealt with as a youth.&lt;ref name="TP2008"/&gt;

==Current status==
Tuttle's current publisher and CEO is Singapore resident Eric Oey.&lt;ref name="China Daily"&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2010-07/23/content_11038802.htm/ Tuttle's tales of tantalizing literary trials and triumphs ''China Daily'' (July 23, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; Oey is a nephew of Charles E.

[[File:Upuh Ulen-Ulen.jpg|thumb|300 px| Upuh Ulen-Ulen from the collection of the Indonesian poet [[Deknong Kemalawati]]]]

The cloth is traditionally placed on a young couple during a wedding ceremony, as well as on the shoulders of guests of honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kodamim-tniad.mil.id/2016/11/21/kenakan-upuh-ulen-ulen-pangdam-im-dan-ibu-jadi-warga-kehormatan-gayo/ Kenakan Upuh Ulen-Ulen, Pangdam IM dan Ibu Jadi Warga Kehormatan Gayo]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 6, 2018, the Acheh poet [[Lesik Kati Ara]] presented [[Joko Widodo]], the president of Indonesia, with a cloth in the [[Istana Negara (Jakarta)|State Palace]] in [[Jakarta]]. &lt;ref&gt; Fikar W Eda.

The cloth has many components. Traditionally, the background is meant to be the same as 'the contrast and color of the Earth'. According to a Gayonese proverb, God created man from the earth, who then lives on the earth and ultimately returns to the earth after death. The white circle in the center symbolizes a full moon.&lt;ref&gt;Andrian Kausyar. [http://www.lintasgayo.com/7936/upuh-ulen-ulen.html Upuh Ulen-Ulen]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other motifs found in Upuh Ulen-Ulen are: 

# A fence (''jang''), since everything in the world has a certain limit, beyond which one should not go.
# Sprouts of bamboo (''tuwis''), which are symbols of persistence, longevity, and happiness.
# A string of clouds (''enum beriring''), which is an allegory of our path through life.&lt;ref&gt; Rosmala Dewi, Irsanti.

The '''Victorian Artists Society''', which can trace its establishment to 1856 in [[Melbourne]], promotes artistic education, art classes and gallery hire [[art gallery|exhibition]] in Australia.

The Victorian Artists Society was formed in March 1888 following the decision of the Victorian Academy of Arts and the Australian Artists' Association to amalgamate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article6109757 |title=VICTORIAN ACADEMY OF ARTS. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=14 March 1888 |accessdate=20 September 2013 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Victorian Academy of Arts had been formed in 1870 with 'about twenty artists and amateurs' amongst its first members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13199253 |title=OUR MELBOURNE LETTER. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=22 January 1870 |accessdate=20 September 2013 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy's forerunner, the Victorian Society of Fine Arts, was established in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71468655 |title=HISTORIC MELBOURNE. |newspaper=[[Australian Town and Country Journal]] |location=NSW |date=22 June 1901 |accessdate=20 September 2013 |page=30 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Artists' Association held its first exhibition in 1886 with works by [[Tom Roberts]], [[Louis Buvelot]], [[Frederick McCubbin]], and [[Arthur Streeton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11571934 |title=EXHIBITION OF THE AUSTRALIAN ARTISTS' ASSOCIATION. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=7 September 1886 |accessdate=20 September 2013 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PANTON. |newspaper=[[Bendigo Advertiser]] |location=Vic. |date=27 October 1913 |accessdate=20 September 2013 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later presidents included [[Frederick McCubbin]] and [[Paul Raphael Montford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4396813 |title=IN A SCULPTOR'S STUDIO. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=5 May 1931 |accessdate=20 September 2013 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The premises at 430 Albert Street in East Melbourne were erected for the society in 1888, enlarged in 1892 and modernised in 1953. Facilities include four galleries, teaching studio, members room, offices and other ancillary facilities.

Membership is restricted to 1000, a figure last reached in 1979, and is open for new members to join. Membership is open to all persons interested in the fine arts, with the emphasis on practising artists.

Regular classes are held in various media which are open to members and non-members including watercolour, oil painting, drawing, mixed media, life model.

Exhibitions are held annually, including the seasonal spring, summer, autumn and winter exhibitions, with awards given at each.

The 2017 Artist of the Year Award was given to Ray Hewitt.

'''Indra Jātrā,''' most commonly known as '''Yenyā''' ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: येँयाः) is the biggest religious street festival in [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]]. Ye means "Kathmandu" and Ya means  "celebration", together it means "celebration inside Kathmandu" in Nepal Bhasa. The celebrations consist of two events, '''Indra Jātrā''' and '''Kumāri Jātrā'''. '''Indra Jātrā''' is marked by masked dances of deities and demons, displays of sacred images and tableaus in honor of the deity [[Indra]], the king of heaven. '''Kumāri Jātrā''' is the chariot procession of the living goddess [[Kumari (children)|Kumari]].

Family members deceased in the past year are also remembered during the festival. The main venue of the festivities is [[Kathmandu Durbar Square]]. The celebrations last for eight days from the 12th day of the bright fortnight to the 4th day of the dark fortnight of [[Yanla (month)|Yanlā]] (ञला), the eleventh month in the lunar [[Nepal Era]] calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Toffin| first = Gérard | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/64459961/Indra-Jatra-of-Kathmandu-Gerard-Toffin| title = The Indra Jātrā of Kathmandu as a Royal Festival Past and Present| work = Contributions to Nepalese Studies| publisher = Center for Nepal and Asian Studies, Tribbuvan University| date=January 1992| accessdate = 24 July 2012}} Page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Tuladhars of Kathmandu: A Study of Buddhist Tradition in a Newar Merchant Community |last=Lewis |first=Todd Thornton |authorlink= |year= 1984|publisher= Columbia University|location= |isbn= |page=377 |pages= |accessdate=30 July 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vl7YAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=inauthor:%22Todd+Thornton+Lewis%22&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Todd+Thornton+Lewis%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4xTy3wyIpK&amp;sig=H2ZhyRfDn09n34xDJZI_LTEGLos&amp;hl=ne&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yIUWUJ37H4vKrAeQwIDYCg&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indra Jatra was started by King Gunakamadeva(गुणकामदेव) to commemorate the founding of the Kathmandu city in the 10th century.&lt;ref name=GP1&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=6671&amp;cat_id=10|title=Indra Jatra, Munindra Ratna Bajracharya | publisher='''Gorkhapatra'''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kumari Jatra began in the mid-18th century. The celebrations are held according to the [[lunar calendar]], so the dates are changeable. This year (2018), the festival takes place from 21st to 28th of September, and the main day of attraction falling on 24th.

==Opening ceremony==
[[File:Yosin raising.jpg|thumb|200px|Raising the Yosin pole]]
The festival starts with '''Yosin Thanegu''' (योसिं थनेगु), the erection of Yosin or Linga, a pole from which the banner of Indra is unfurled, at Kathmandu Durbar Square. The pole, a tree shorn of its branches and stripped of its bark, is obtained from a forest near [[Nala, Nepal|Nālā]], a small town 29&amp;nbsp;km to the east of Kathmandu. It is dragged in stages to Durbar Square by men pulling on ropes.

Another event on the first day is '''Upāku Wanegu''' (उपाकु वनेगु) when participants visit shrines holding lighted incense to honor deceased family members. They also place small butter lamps on the way. Some sing hymns as they make the tour. The circuitous route winds along the periphery of the historic part of the city. The procession starts at around 4 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.lonelyplanet.com/nepal/travel-tips-and-articles/2281| title = Kathmandu's Indra Jatra Festival| work = | publisher = Lonely Planet| year=2012| accessdate = 1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this festival, three chariots carrying human representations of the deities [[Ganesh]], [[Bhairava]] and [[Kumari (children)|Kumari]] accompanied by musical bands are pulled along the festival route through Kathmandu on three days. The procession starts at around 3 pm.

On the first day of Kumari Jatra known as '''Kwaneyā''' (क्वनेया:), the chariots are pulled through the southern part of town.

On 5 September 2017 the [[Newar people]] of the state gathered at [[Namchi]], [[South Sikkim district]] for the celebration, first time in the district.

==In Terai==

Indra Jatra is also observed in some districts of Terai (Nepal and Indian Northern Bihar) as Indra Puja according to the local traditions. Rituals are different than in the Kathmandu Valley but the festival is observed around the same time indicating a common origin of the festival, probably during the Lichhavi period.

==Mythology==
According to legend, [[Indra]] (Hindu god-king of heaven), disguised as a farmer, descended to earth in search of ''parijat'' ([[Nyctanthes arbor-tristis|Night jasmine]]), a white flower his mother Basundhara needed to perform a ritual. As he was plucking the flowers at Maruhiti, a sunken water spout at [[Maru, Kathmandu|Maru]], the people caught and bound him like a common thief. He was then put on display in the town square of Maru in Kathmandu. (In a reenactment of this event, an image of Indra with his hands bound is put on display at Maru and other places during the festival.)

His mother, worried about his extended absence, came to Kathmandu and wandered around looking for him. (This event is commemorated by the procession of Dagin (दागिं) through the city. Pulu Kisi (alternate name Tānā Kisi), a wicker representation of an elephant, also runs around town reenacting Indra's elephant searching frantically for its master.)&lt;ref&gt;van den Hoek, A. W. (2004) ''Caturmāsa: Celebrations of death in Kathmandu, Nepal.'' CNWS Publications. {{ISBN|9789057890987}}. Page 53. Retrieved 4 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the city folk realized they had captured Indra himself, they were appalled and immediately released him. Out of appreciation for his release, his mother promised to provide enough dew throughout the winter to ensure a rich crop. It is said that Kathmandu starts to experience foggy mornings from this festival onwards because of this boon.&lt;ref&gt;Burbank, Jon (2002). ''Cultures of the World: Nepal.'' Marshall Cavendish. {{ISBN|9780761414766}}. Page 115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guru&gt;{{cite web |url= http://guru.com.np/indrajatra.htm|title=Indrajatra | publisher='''guru.com.np'''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closing ceremony==
On the last day, the yosin pole erected at Durbar Square is taken down in a ceremony known as '''Yosin Kwathalegu''' (योसिं क्वथलेगु). It marks the end of the festivities.

==Open air theater==
Yenya is also the season of open air theatre productions. Performances depicting social themes, satire and comedy are held on dance platforms or makeshift stages at market squares all over the [[Kathmandu Valley]] on the sidelines of the sacred festival. The plays, known as Dabu Pyākhan (दबू प्याखं), have a history going back centuries.

'''Āina-kāri'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/aina-kari-mosaic-of-mirror-glass&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-fa|آینه‌کاری}}) is a kind of [[interior decoration]] by putting small pieces of mirror together in [[geometric]] forms or in forms of flowers and shrubs. By this art, a craftsman creates a beautiful shining space in a building with cut mirrors in various forms. The reflex of light through numberless formed mirror pieces gives out brightness and effulgence. Beside the decoration use, this art is used as a strong durable cover for an interior space of a building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= |last=Moein|title=Farhang-e Moein|trans-title=Moein Persian Dictionary|publisher=|isbn=|editor-first=|editor-last=|page=|language=Persian|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
