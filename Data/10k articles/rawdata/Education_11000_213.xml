This document describes the CGA's hierarchy structure and the tools they used each school year in [[Information and Communication Technology (education)|ICT]] schools

== School year 2003–04 ==
During the school year 2003-2004, the Andalusian Government opened 100 ICT schools in [[Andalusia]] as a pilot experience.
* 50 ICT schools for e-Government
* 50 ICT schools for educational process
* A total of 18.000 PCs

Tools that they used:
* Cheops
* [[Bugzilla]]
* [[Nagios]]
* [[Multi Router Traffic Grapher|MRTG]]

Hierarchy structure of the staff:

[[Image:Estructura CGA Andalucia curso 2003 04 ingles.png|centre|border]]

== School year 2004–05 ==
* 150 schools for e-Government
* 150 schools for educational process
* A total of 58.000 PCs

Software that CGA used during this school year:
* Cheops
* Nagios
* MRTG
* Sigila (self-made: Sistema Integral de Gestión de Incidencias y Localización de Averias or Integral System to Manage and Localize system's Breakdowns)
* Unattended Operating System installations 
**[[Preboot Execution Environment|PXE]]
**SystemImager
* Tools to share and security
**[[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]]
**[[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]]
**[[rsync]]

[[Image:Estructura CGA Andalucia curso 2004 2005ingles.png|centre|border]]

== School year 2005–06 ==
* 618 for the two purpose (for e-Government and for educational process)
* A total of 105.000 PCs

CGA omitted the use of this software tools because they were not useful for a big Network with 105.000 PC:
* Cheops
* Nagios
* MRTG

Control software tools:
* Sigila
* Unattended installations of the Operating System
**PXE
**SystemImager
* Tools to share and security
**NFS
**LDAP
**RSYNC
* Unattended software installations:
**CFEngine
* Munin
* Visco (self-made, this is Nagios' adaptation for a bigger network)

Software to be used at the schools
* Apagado remoto de equipos (Remote shutdown for all PC in the ICT School)
* CRV (Cañón de red virtual or Virtual Network Projector)
* iTALC

== School year 2006–07 ==
* 1.100 ICT Schools
* 185.000 PC

Human and technical resource are difficult to scalar, then, the CGA needed to design a new solution 
to reach two objectives:

* Control, management and flexibility
* To control the grown of human and technical resources

To reach these objectives CGA used [[ITIL]]

The '''Association for Theological Education in South East Asia''' ('''ATESEA''') is an organisation of Christian [[seminaries]] and other [[tertiary education|tertiary institutes]] of [[theology]]. It is based in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]] and currently networks 102 member institutions and schools in 16 countries. It also acts as an [[School accreditation|accreditation agency]] for theological education in the [[Southeast Asia|South East Asian]] region.

ATESEA publishes the ''[[Asia Journal of Theology]]'', provides accreditation services, operates the [[South East Asia Graduate School of Theology]], and promotes faculty development, theological renewal and contextualization in the light of the "Critical Asian Principle",&lt;ref&gt;ATESEA: [http://www.atesea.org/acap.htm Critical Asian Principle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222164649/http://www.atesea.org/acap.htm |date=February 22, 2007 }} (URL last accessed on May 4, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; while coordinating regional planning in Christian theological education.

ATESEA has recently come up with their new 'Guidelines for Doing Theology in Asia'.{{when|date=October 2013}}

ATESEA is a full member of the World Conference of Associations of Theological Institutions (WOCATI) by which the association is networked with other regional associations and accreditation agencies for theological education worldwide like the [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]] (ATS), the [[American Theological Library Association]] (ATLA) and the [[Board of Theological Education of the Senate of Serampore College]] (BTESS) in India.&lt;ref&gt;WOCATI: [http://www.wocati.org/members.html Member Associations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827215926/http://www.wocati.org/members.html |date=2008-08-27 }} (URL accessed on May 4, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims and objectives==

The aims of the ATESEA according to Section II of the association's constitution&lt;ref name="atesea.org"&gt;ATESEA: [http://www.atesea.org/aconstitution.htm Constitution] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221005107/http://www.atesea.org/aconstitution.htm |date=February 21, 2007 }} (URL accessed on May 4, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; are as follows:

# To promote creative relationships among institutions and agencies engaged in theological education and the churches in the region.
# To facilitate regional efforts in theological education in the service of the churches in South East Asia.
# To set guidelines and standards of theological education and to provide accreditation services to member institutions and to others requesting it.
# To work for the improvement and renewal of theological education in the region in such ways it may deem appropriate.

==History==

ATESEA was established as the '''Association of Theological Schools in South East Asia''' in 1957 in [[Singapore]] with 16 schools as founding members. The first full meeting was held in 1959 under the leadership of [[Benjamin I. Guansing]] of the Philippines and [[John R. Fleming]] was elected as the first executive director. The secretariat and offices of ATESEA was in Singapore from 1959 to 1974. In June 1974, ATESEA moved to Manila, Philippines when Emerito P. Nacpil was elected the executive director. It was again relocated to Singapore in 1981.

In 1981, the name of the association was changed to the current title and continued to expand its scope of operations to include the conducting of theological study institutes in disciplines of the theological spectrum such as the improvement of the management and administration of schools, the search for a new spirituality in Christian formation, the encouragement of the experiments in innovative or alternative patterns of theological education, the promotion of closer relationship between seminary and church, the search for a more adequate understanding of excellence in theological education and the development of Asian perspective and insights in Christian theology. It has also facilitated faculty exchange among its member schools and institutions.

In 1998, the secretariat and offices was again relocated to Manila; it has remained there to date.&lt;ref&gt;ATESEA: [http://www.atesea.org/ahistory.htm A Historical Note] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221005147/http://www.atesea.org/ahistory.htm |date=February 21, 2007 }} (URL accessed on May 4, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation==

ATESEA runs an Accreditation Commission which provides accreditation for tertiary institutes of theology and seminaries. The commission is composed of the Executive Committee of ATESEA plus two people elected by the association, normally chosen from the Graduated School Senate.&lt;ref&gt;ATESEA: [http://www.atesea.org/aaccredit.html The Accreditation Commission] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221004945/http://www.atesea.org/aaccredit.html |date=February 21, 2007 }} (URL accessed on May 4, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Accreditation by ATESEA does not necessarily mean that the member institutions are granted accreditation by the education regulatory bodies of the countries where the institutions are. Many countries in the South East Asian region do not have a formal accreditation process for Christian theological education. In countries where such processes exist like Australia&lt;ref&gt;ATESEA: [http://www.atesea.org/amember1.htm#aus Member Institutions - Australia (Australian Lutheran College)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221004907/http://www.atesea.org/amember1.htm#aus |date=February 21, 2007 }} (URL accessed on May 4, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Training and Skills Commission, South Australia: [http://www.training.sa.gov.au/OVETorgs/pages/default/providers/ Online Register] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628215732/http://www.training.sa.gov.au/OVETorgs/pages/default/providers/ |date=June 28, 2007 }} (URL last accessed on May 4, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and Indonesia,&lt;ref&gt;ATESEA: [http://www.atesea.org/amember1.htm#aus Member Institutions - Indonesia (Universitas Kristen Indonesia Maluku)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221004907/http://www.atesea.org/amember1.htm#aus |date=February 21, 2007 }} (URL accessed on May 4, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Directorate General for Higher Education, Indonesia: [http://dikti.org/dirPTS/maluku.htm Directory of Private Institutions - Maluku] (URL last accessed on May 4, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; ATESEA accredited institutions have also been accredited by the respective national and regional accreditation agencies.

==Membership==

ATESEA has a two-tier membership: regular and affiliate. The former is open to institutions engaged in the provision of training for the Christian ministry in South East Asia and the latter open to institutions involved in theological education in South East Asia, such as research and study centers, lay training institutes, and [[Theological Education by Extension]] centers.&lt;ref name="atesea.org"/&gt;

===Member institutions===

ATESEA has 102 member institutions in [[Australia]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Cambodia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Myanmar]], [[New Zealand]], [[Pakistan]], [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]].

Some [[university|universities]] offer [[undergraduate degree]] students the opportunity to specialise in a particular area of economics, such as: [[agricultural economics]], [[econometrics]], environmental and resource economics, [[financial economics]], and [[political economy]].&lt;ref name="University of Sydney course information"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/courses/bachelor-of-economics|title=BACHELOR OF ECONOMICS|publisher=The University of Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree consists of a single-year full-time program. The degree requires more academic courses with a researched [[thesis]] component.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://sydney.edu.au/courses/courses/uc/bachelor-of-economics-honours.html |title=Bachelor of Economics (Honours) |website=University of Sydney |access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4052">'''CSCOPE''' is a [[K-12]] [[Curriculum|educational curriculum]] support system that has been widely adopted in [[Texas]]. It was created by the Texas Education Service Center Curriculum Collaborative (TESCCC).

==Use==

Nineteen out of twenty education regions in Texas have districts that use CSCOPE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gulick |first=Joe |url=http://lubbockonline.com/education/2010-08-15/new-curriculum-system-cscope-bring-big-changes-schools-lubbock-across-state |title=New curriculum system CSCOPE to bring big changes to schools in Lubbock, across state &amp;#124; Lubbock Online &amp;#124; Lubbock Avalanche-Journal |publisher=Lubbock Online |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of January 2, 2011 there were 747 [[school district]]s (out of 1,051 total) using it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2011/01/02/2739194/school-districts-adopting-cscope.html |title=School districts adopting CSCOPE online curriculum &amp;#124; Mom2MomDFW.com |publisher=Star-telegram.com |date=2011-01-03 |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

While popular with district administrators, CSCOPE has elicited mixed reactions from teachers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.proteacher.net/discussions/showthread.php?t=84597 |title=Texas Teachers ~ Do you use C-Scope? - ProTeacher Community |publisher=Proteacher.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of whom feel excessively constrained by a set [[School timetable|timetable]] for lessons.  Other teachers, however, feel that CSCOPE is appreciated by the students and has improved classroom performance and attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Campbell |first=Roger |url=http://www.llanonews.com/news/article/28927 |title=News &amp; Photos - The Llano News - Llano, Texas |publisher=The Llano News |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312034723/http://www.llanonews.com/news/article/28927# |archive-date=2012-03-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some say that CSCOPE will better help prepare districts for the next generation of [[standardized test]]s in Texas, such as the [[State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness]] test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tea.state.tx.us/index4.aspx?id=7874 |title=Texas Education Agency - STAAR debuts |publisher=Tea.state.tx.us |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system is a product of an increased emphasis on [[accountability]] in [[State school|public education]] over the last two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Work |first=Ann |url=http://www.timesrecordnews.com/news/2010/mar/26/local-schools-planning-for-new-cscope-curriculum/ |title=Local schools planning for new CSCOPE curriculum |publisher=Times Record News |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upcoming changes==
In 2013, after complaints about parents' inability to access the curriculum as well as about lesson plans, Texas announced significant changes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/cypresscreek/news/sen-patrick-cscope-announce-sweeping-changes/article_dfb36eaa-7216-11e2-9245-0019bb2963f4.html |title=
Sen. Patrick, CSCOPE announce sweeping changes  |publisher=Cyprus Creek Mirror |date=Feb 8, 2013 |accessdate=Feb 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; would be made to the system. These changes include:

* Making all meetings of the governing board public, and meeting all the respective [[notice]] requirements.
* A joint review process of all CSCOPE lessons, beginning with [[Social studies|Social Studies]].
* Removing civil or criminal penalties associated with the release of CSCOPE content.
* Allowing teachers to post any and all CSCOPE lessons that they deem necessary.
* Creating a standing curriculum review panel composed of parents, teachers, and school administrators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5041">'''Centro Velico Caprera''' ('''CVC''') is  one of the oldest  [[Italy|Italian]]  [[sailing]] schools and also one of the largest of the  [[Mediterranean sea]]. Since its foundation in 1967 it has been attended by over 100,000 students. The legal head office is located at [[La Maddalena]] and the base of operations is situated on the island of [[Caprera]], on the Maddalena archipelago. CVC is a non-profit organisation and a member of the ISSA (International Sailing School Association).

==History==

The school was founded in 1967 based upon the ideas of Vittorio di Sambuy and Marco [[Notarbartolo|Notarbartolo di Sciara]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  |url=http://www.altomareblu.com/centro-velico-caprera-cvc/
  |title=La nascita del CVC

  |first=Vittorio|last=di Sambuy
  |date=8 January 2009
  |language=Italian
}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was, at the time, president of Milan’s section of the [[Italian Navy]] League. The two authors of the idea were granted the land where the center of the Admiral Alessandro Michelagnoli, at the time Commander in Chief of the Italian Navy, was built. Franco Brambilla, president of the [[Touring Club Italiano]], joined the association guaranteeing the organizational and administrative support of the Touring Club. Finally, Guido Colnaghi, who represented the French association [[Les Glénans|École des Glénans]] in Italy, shaped the teaching spirit and approach that distinguishes the character of the CVC. The two founding members, Milan’s section of the Italian Navy League and the Touring Club, were then joined by the Students Association in 1975.

==Objectives of the school and Course progression==

The Centro Velico Caprera, school of sea and sailing, has as its main objective the knowledge and education of the sail training’s basis through practice and experimentation to ensure a safe growth. Another goal is to transmit the fundamentals of maritime consciousness, essential for later offshore sailing. For this reason, life’s organization both on base and on the boats is modeled to transmit to the students the life of a crew. There are three levels of courses:

*1st or beginner level: sailing [[dinghies]] or small [[cabin cruiser]]s;
*2nd level: high performance dinghies or short voyages on cabin cruisers;
*3rd level: racing dinghies (semi-skiff), 8 meter racing cruisers, or long range voyages on large cabin cruisers.

==The schools location==

The CVC is located in the southwest part of the island of [[Caprera]], between Punta Coda and the gulf of Porto Palma, and is composed of 3 separate bases. On the side of Punta Coda, the beginner level base consists of military buildings used as dormitories, classrooms, and a canteen. The second base is at the foot of the Fico Mountain, and hosts the students of the 2nd level. The third base, located on the western end of Porto Palma, hosts all students taking courses on cabin cruisers. Furthermore, the CVC staff operates a carpentry, a mechanical workshop and a sail repairing facility.

==Life on the base==

A typical day at CVC is planned on a tight schedule that all members of the community must respect. Every day students alternate between practical and theoretical lessons, with meals in between. Once a week every student gives his contribute to the school by cleaning the base and helping the cook and the Chief of Operations, who is in charge of the kitchen.

==The instructors==

The instructors at CVC are all volunteers who are chosen among the school’s best students. After being recommended, which happens through the evaluation of  technical knowledge and social skills, in order to become an instructor the student must pass successfully a training course which takes place in spring and autumn. The Instructional positions at CVC are:

* On boat assistant (AdV)
* Instructor (Is)
* Rescue boat captain (CB)

There is a principal instructor for every course, known as:

* Course Manager (CT)

The base is managed by a:

* Base Supervisor

There is also a:

* Chief of Operations (AT)

Who coordinates the students while they clean the base and help in the kitchen.

==The fleet==
Currently (2014) the CVC's base at Caprera owns and operates the following vessels:

Initiation level on dinghies:

* 17 Laser Bahia
* 35 [[Laser 2000]]
* 11 Topaz Argo

Initiation level on small cabin cruisers:

* 6 Dehler 25

The '''Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange''' ('''CCKF'''; {{zh|c=蔣經國國際學術交流基金會}}) is a private,  non-profit organisation located in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], that provides support for [[research grant]]s on [[Chinese studies]] in the [[humanities]] and [[social science]]s at overseas institutions.  It was founded in 1989 and named after [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], leader of the [[Republic of China]] from 1972 to 1988.   The foundation also has a regional office in [[McLean, Virginia]] in the [[United States]].

==History==
The Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange was founded in 1989 by officials of the [[Kuomintang]], the ruling party of the Republic of China.&lt;ref name="kaplan"&gt;{{cite book | title=Fires of the Dragon: Politics, Murder, and the Kuomintang | first=David E. | last=Kaplan| publisher=[[Atheneum Books]] | year= 1992 | isbn=0-689-12066-4 | page=483}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stated motivation for the foundation stems from professors of Chinese descent at American universities becoming concerned about the decline of programs of Chinese studies at colleges and universities overseas, and their desire to reverse this situation.&lt;ref name="cckf-intro"/&gt;  Chiang Ching-kuo is said to have favored creation of the foundation,&lt;ref name="cckf-intro"/&gt; and it was created as a living memorial to him.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;  The foundation was patterned after the [[Fulbright Program]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://iir.nccu.edu.tw/attachments/journal/add/4/40-0304-9.pdf | title=Organizations That Support Taiwan Studies: A Select Overview | first=Deborah | last=Brown | journal=[[Issues &amp; Studies]] | volume=40 | issue=3/4 | date=September–December 2004 | pages=281–314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation's original endowment was [[United States dollar|US$]]86 million,&lt;ref name="kaplan"/&gt; consisting of $53 million from the [[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|Republic of China Ministry of Education]] and $33 million from private donors.&lt;ref name="cckf-intro"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cckf.org.tw/e-introduce.htm | title=Introduction | publisher=Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation | accessdate=1 January 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811035336/http://www.cckf.org.tw/e-introduce.htm | archivedate=11 August 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The foundation then operates using the interest generated from this endowment, which as of 2004 was $3.4 million for a year.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;  The foundation is governed by a board, consisting of prominent government officials, academics, people in industry, and assorted other citizens.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;  As of 2011, the board had 19 members; its chair was [[Kao-wen Mao]], and notable members included former  [[Taiwan Province]] governor [[James Soong]], [[Morris Chang]] of [[TSMC|Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation]], former [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] Vice-Chancellor [[Lawrence Lau]], and former [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Republic of China)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Frederick F. Chien]].&lt;ref name="cckf-board"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cckf.org.tw/e-organization.htm | title=CCKF Organization | publisher=Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation | accessdate=25 January 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830094333/http://www.cckf.org.tw/e-organization.htm | archivedate=30 August 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ministry of Education continues to have a strong voice in foundation decisions.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;

The foundation's principal goals are to foster the overseas study of Chinese culture and society, to support international scholarly exchange, to promote widespread attention to and understanding of Taiwan, and to promote academic dialogue on global issues.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;
The foundation organizes its grants by four geographical areas: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and domestic (Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao); historically, most of its activity has been with those in the United States.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;

In its first seven years of operation, the foundation spent $23 million on American scholarship.&lt;ref name="nyt-96"/&gt;  By 2001, many Western academics who were specialists in China were getting research funds from the foundation.&lt;ref name="nyt-01"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/01/world/for-china-born-us-citizens-visiting-homeland-has-risks.html?pagewanted=all | title= For China-Born U.S. Citizens, Visiting Homeland Has Risks | author=Rosenthal, Elizabeth | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=May 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2004, the foundation had supported nearly 2,000 projects overall.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;

The Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation provides research grants, fellowship grants, grants for conferences, seminars, and workshops, publication subsidies, doctoral fellowships (including for Taiwanese students abroad), and travel grants and visiting fellowships.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;&lt;ref name="duke"/&gt;  In some cases, research that focuses on Taiwan's recent social, cultural, economic, or political development is encouraged, as are collaborative projects with scholars in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="duke"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://researchfunding.duke.edu/detail.asp?OppID=1013 | title=Funding Opportunities – Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange – Fellowships and Grants for the American Region | publisher=[[Duke University]] | accessdate=1 January 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719191001/https://researchfunding.duke.edu/detail.asp?OppID=1013 | archivedate=19 July 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grants from the foundation have sometimes proven controversial.  In 1996, the [[University of California, Berkeley]] was offered $3 million for a new center to study ancient Chinese cultures, but the offer was dependent upon the university commemorating both the foundation and Chiang Ching-kuo.  This brought about opposition to the proposed funding by students and scholars who objected to the history of political repression during the earlier years of Chiang's regime, who thought it would damage Berkeley's reputation and put Berkeley under undue control by the foundation, and who feared it would harm the university's research and exchange student dealings with the [[People's Republic of China]].  The director of the US office of the foundation said in response that political aspects are not a factor in the foundation's funding decisions.&lt;ref name="nyt-96"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A10F6385B0C7A8CDDAB0994DE494D81&amp;pagewanted=all | title=Donations to Universities Sometimes Carry a Price | author=Golden, Tim | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=9 December 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The university decided to name the program, but not the center, after Chiang and the foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&amp;s_site=mercurynews&amp;p_multi=SJ&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB72049C85D2F8E&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | title=Will Name Program, Not Center, After Chiang Ching-Kuo Group | newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]] | date=14 December 1996 | page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing the foundation to suspend the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&amp;s_site=mercurynews&amp;p_multi=SJ&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB72062ADC09661&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | title=Taiwan Foundation Holds Up Its Grant | newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]] | date=18 January 1997 | page=14A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, two centers for Sinological research were set up:&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt; The Chiang Ching-kuo International Sinological Center at Charles University (CCK-ISC) was established in 1997 at [[Charles University in Prague]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cck-isc.ff.cuni.cz/aboutUsEn.htm | title=Chiang Ching-kuo International Sinological Centre at Charles University | publisher=[[Charles University in Prague]] | accessdate=2 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Chiang Ching-kuo Center for Chinese Cultural and Institutional History  was established in 1999 in conjunction with the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures at [[Columbia University]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ealac/affiliated_organizations.html | title=Affiliated Organizations | publisher=[[Columbia University]] | accessdate=2 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/04/03/cu_east_asian_resource.html | title=Columbia University East Asian Resources | publisher=[[Columbia University]] | accessdate=2 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political complexities have also extended to scholars working in the People's Republic, who have worried that getting research funds from the foundation or other sources in Taiwan would lead to them being suspected as spying for or otherwise colluding with Taiwan.&lt;ref name="nyt-01"/&gt;

'''Chinesisch-Deutsche Hochschulkolleg''', or CDHK ({{zh|first=s|s=中德学院|t=中德學院|p=Zhōng Dé Xuéyuàn}}), is the [[China|Chinese]] [[Germany|German]] [[College]] for [[Postgraduate]] Studies located in [[Shanghai]], [[China]].

==History==

The idea to combine educational activities in a joint Chinese-German university college for postgraduate studies dates back to the visit of former German chancellor [[Dr. Helmut Kohl]] in November 1993. Negotiations between China and Germany started in 1994, and in the following year the [[German Academic Exchange Service]] (DAAD) was assigned the realization of this project.

The [[Shanghai]] "Chinesisch-Deutsches Hochschulkolleg" or CDHK, as the college for postgraduate studies is called for short, was finally opened in February 1998. On October 7, 2002, the college moved into new modern building in [[Chifeng Lu]].

==Objectives==

As an institute at [[Tongji University]], the CDHK today offers [[bilingual]] [[master's degree|master studies]] in the following fields:
*[[electrical engineering]] ([[automation]], [[information technology]])
*[[mechanical engineering]] ([[production engineering]], [[automotive engineering]])
*[[economics]] ([[supply chain management]], [[marketing]], [[Managerial finance|financial management]], [[economic law]], [[actuarial science]])

According to German educational standards, the curriculum is oriented towards broad knowledge and practical experience. Thus, the CDHK is able to train junior staff with both leadership qualities and experience in two cultures for the benefit of Chinese and German companies in China.

==Course of studies==

The postgraduate studies at CDHK take three years and start with intensive [[German language]] training in the first [[semester]].  From the second to the third semester students proceed their language studies in addition to their respective field studies and will attend a language test. As an end of the [[German language]] training course, all the students are obliged to take a middle-level German test and received a [[German language]] certificate issued by German College of Tongji University.

The students attend classes of Chinese professors who themselves have studied in Germany for a considerable time or finished their [[PhD]] at a German university. Moreover, each semester CDHK invites German tutors for one or two weeks to hold German language lectures in their respective fields. Basically all the courses are co-conducted by Chinese and German Professors.

===Double Masters Program===
In the fourth semester students have the chance to go to Germany for an [[internship]] in a company and/or study at one of its partner universities. In the later case, students must have passed TestDAF, a German language test, with at least a score of 16(on a 20 scale). In electro technics there even is the chance to prepare for an international final degree at the [[Technical University of Munich]], the so-called "double master" program. In the year of 2008, this "double master " program was extended to the students of mechanical engineering with the partner university of [[Ruhr-University Bochum]] This program is sponsored partially by [[German Academic Exchange Service|DAAD]]. Several graduates already work on their PhD either in Germany or China.

==Perspectives==

The Chinese-German College for Postgraduate Studies is sponsored by Tongji-University and the DAAD as well as by numerous companies that have among others donated eighteen chairs and support the project by presentation, visits and contacts. It is the first educational joint-venture of this dimension, enjoying the support of both [[government]]s, and has the advantage of the close cooperation with its entrepreneurial sponsors.

==Partner Universities==
* [[RWTH Aachen University]]
* [[Berlin Institute of Technology]]
* [[Ruhr University Bochum]]
* [[Technische Universität Darmstadt]]
* Goethe Business School, Frankfurt
* [[Kühne Logistics University]], Hamburg
* [[Bucerius Law School]], Hamburg

'''Consensus reality'''&lt;ref&gt;"Reality by Consensus": An Analysis of the Metapragmatic and Therapeutic Dimensions of Vampiric Live Action Role-playing. Reviews Indiana University, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quantum Consciousness. By Lily Splane. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gnjxnq7ZRTAC&amp;pg=PA51 Pg 51]&lt;/ref&gt; is that which is generally agreed to be [[reality]], based on a [[consensus]] view.

The appeal to consensus arises from the fact that humans do not fully understand or agree upon the nature of [[knowledge]] or [[ontology]], often making it uncertain what is real, given the vast inconsistencies between individual [[subjectivity|subjectivities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal About the Mind |last=Lakoff |first=George |authorlink=George Lakoff |year=1987 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-46804-6 |pages=259 |quote=In summary, Putnam has shown that existing formal versions of objectivist ''epistemology'' are inconsistent; there can be no objectively correct ''description'' of reality from a God's eye point of view. This does not, of course, mean that there is no objective reality—only that we have no ''privileged access'' to it from an external viewpoint.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reason, Truth, and History |last=Putnam |first=Hilary |authorlink=Hilary Putnam |year=1981 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; We can, however, seek to obtain some form of consensus, with others, of what is real. We can use this consensus as a pragmatic guide, either on the assumption that it seems to approximate some kind of valid reality, or simply because it is more "practical" than perceived alternatives. Consensus reality therefore refers to the agreed-upon concepts of reality which people in the world, or a culture or group, believe are real (or treat as real), usually based upon their common experiences as they believe them to be; anyone who does not agree with these is sometimes stated to be "in effect... living in a different world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David G., editor |last=Stork |title=Hal's Legacy: 2001's Computer as Dream and Reality |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-69211-2 |page=201 |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history this has also raised a social question as to the effects of a society in which all individuals do not agree upon the same reality.

Children have sometimes been described or viewed as "inexperience[d] with consensus reality,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lois |last=Rostow Kuznets |title=When Toys Come Alive: Narratives of Animation, Metamorphosis, and Development |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1994 |isbn=0-300-05645-1 |pages=228, note 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; though are described as such with the expectation that their perspective will progressively form closer to the consensus reality of their society as they age.

==General discussion==
In considering the nature of reality, two broad approaches exist: the [[philosophical realism|realist]] approach, in which there is a single, [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], overall reality believed to exist irrespective of the [[philosophy of perception|perceptions]] of any given individual, and the [[idealism|idealistic]] approach, in which it is considered that an individual can verify nothing except their own ''[[experience]]'' of the world, and can never directly know the truth of the world independent of that.

Consensus reality may be understood by studying [[socially constructed reality]], a subject within the [[sociology of knowledge]]. (Read page three of ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]'' by [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]].)

Consider this example: consensus reality for people who follow a particular theocentric religion is different from consensus reality for those who follow another theocentric religion, or from those that eschew theocentric religions in favor of [[science]] alone, for explaining life and the [[universe]].

In societies where theocentric religions are dominant, the religious understanding of existence would be the consensus reality, while the religious worldview would remain the non-consensus (or alternative) reality in a predominantly [[secular]] society, where the consensus reality is grounded in science alone.

In this way, different individuals and communities have fundamentally different [[world view]]s,&lt;ref name="ken_wilber_1"&gt;According to philosopher [[Ken Wilber]]. See Ken Wilber's book ''A Brief History of Everything''.&lt;/ref&gt; with fundamentally different comprehensions of the world around them, and of the constructs within which they live. Thus, a society that is, for example, completely secular and one which believes every eventuality to be subject to metaphysical influence will have very different consensus realities, and many of their beliefs on broad issues such as [[science]], [[slavery]], and [[human sacrifice]] may differ in direct consequence because of the differences in the perceived nature of the world they live in.

==In science and philosophy==
{{See also|Scientific consensus}}

===Idealists===
Some [[idealists]] ([[subjective idealism|subjective idealists]]) hold the view that there isn't one particular way things are, but rather that each person's [[private language argument | personal reality]] is unique. Such idealists have the [[world view]] which says that we each create our own reality, and while most people may be in general agreement (consensus) about what reality is like, they might live in a different (or nonconsensus) reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkuVBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=subjective+idealism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7ivm4kIrZAhVHWqwKHb5BBfsQ6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Kantian Reason and Hegelian Spirit: The Idealistic Logic of Modern Theology|last=Dorrien|first=Gary|date=2015-03-16|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781119016540|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materialists===
[[Materialists]] may not accept the idea of there being different possible realities for different people, rather than different beliefs about one [[reality]]. So for them only the first usage of the term reality would make sense. To them, someone believing otherwise, where the facts have been properly established, might be considered [[delusion]]al.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Social consequences==

===Views on the term===
The [[connotation]] of the term "consensus reality" is usually disparaging: it is usually employed by [[idealist]], [[surrealist]] and other [[anti-realist]] [[theorist]]s opposing or hostile to this "reality," with the implication that this consensus reality is, to a greater or lesser extent, created by those who experience it. (The phrase "consensus reality" may be used more loosely to refer to any generally accepted set of beliefs.) However, there are those who use the term approvingly for the practical benefits of all agreeing on a common set of assumptions or experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Zane Crawford |title=ideotrope: consensus reality |url=https://ideotrope.org/index.pl?node_id=659 |accessdate=2007-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928103508/https://ideotrope.org/index.pl?node_id=659 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social aspects===
Singers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Scott |first=Aaron |title=Angel in America: Holcombe Waller's seraphic voice provides comfort during ''Troubled Times'' |newspaper=[[Just Out]] (Portland, Oregon) |volume=22 |issue=20 |page=37 |date=August 19, 2005 |url=http://www.holcombewaller.com/PressContent/JustOut0805.jpg |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; painters, writers, theorists and other individuals employing a number of means of action have attempted to oppose or undermine consensus reality while others have declared that they are "ignoring" it. For example, [[Salvador Dalí]] intended by his paranoiac-critical method&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DALI.UFFS.NET - Salvador Dali - Odjinud ... |url=http://dali.uffs.net/ascii/napsali/1990eyer.html |accessdate=2007-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407043059/http://dali.uffs.net/ascii/napsali/1990eyer.html |archivedate=2007-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to "systematize confusion thanks to a paranoia and active process of thought and so assist in discrediting completely the world of reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bryan M.

'''The Debs''' or '''The Grad''' is a [[School formal|formal ball]] for students in their final year of [[secondary school]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Head to Head: Debs’ Balls|url=http://trinitynews.ie/head-to-head-debs-balls/|accessdate=20 July 2015|work=Trinity News|date=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; analogous to the [[prom]] in North American schools or the [[school formal]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Culturgrams: The Nations Around Us: The Americas and Europe|author1=M. Kennedy|first=David|date=1998|publisher=Ferguson|year=|isbn=|location=Brigham Young University,  Center for International Studies|page=147|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;"Debs" short for "debutante" is the usual name but some boys' and coeducational schools refer to it as; "grad", short for graduation. 

They are usually organised by someone other than the school itself. Traditionally, a student committee is created within the school and would organize the event in collaboration with select teachers, though debs planning companies have in recent years been responsible for the majority of the work.

Debs usually take place after the Leaving Certificate exam is over and some even after the Leaving Certificate results are released. Each secondary school would host their own ball. Most schools would have their debs in Autumn but some choose to begin their final year of school with the debs. Some schools even have a smaller ball before the debs, known as the "pre-debs" which would be held in January/February or even as late as May.

Students may worry about being invited or finding a date but many attend with friends or in a group, not worrying about the [[dating]] aspect. It is not uncommon for students to not go with their boyfriend/girlfriend and instead go with a friend. Whether the female asks the male, or vice versa, is irrelevant. Men are usually attired in [[black tie|dinner jacket]]s with bow ties and women usually wear formal [[gown]]s or [[dress]]es adorned with a [[Nosegay|corsage]] given to them by their date, formal attire is not required for entrance it is tradition to wear suits or dresses. It is customary for men to purchase an [[orchid]] or a bouquet of flowers or a box of chocolates to give to their dates. 

The debs is usually held at a hotel or other large function room. The debs usually, though not always, is a formal dinner, followed by music consisting of pop, dance, rock music and even traditional Irish music. Alcohol is almost always served.  Traditionally there is a photographer present, who will take individual shots of each couple, several throughout the night, the dancing and whatever speeches occur. It is not uncommon for the event to last all night, hence attendees do not to return home until the following morning, often going for breakfast together. Sometimes the hotel will provide this.

A report, published in 2013, found girls spent on average €825 on the night, including their dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teenage girls spending an average of €825 on their Debs|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/debs-1036343-Aug2013/|accessdate=20 July 2015|work=The Journal|date=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23058">The '''dissenting academies''' were schools, colleges and seminaries (often institutions with aspects of all three) run by [[English Dissenters]], that is, those who [[nonconformism|did not conform]] to the [[Church of England]]. They formed a significant part of [[education in England|England’s educational systems]] from the mid-seventeenth to nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref name="IP"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Parker |first1= Irene |authorlink1= |title= Dissenting academies in England: their rise and progress, and their place among the educational systems of the country |url= https://archive.org/details/dissentingacadem00parkiala/ |format= |accessdate=  |year=1914 &amp; 2009|publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-521-74864-3|oclc=  |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
After the [[Uniformity Act 1662]], for about two centuries, it was difficult for any but practising members of the [[Church of England]] to gain degrees from the old English universities, at Cambridge and Oxford. The [[University of Oxford]], in particular, required –  until the [[Oxford University Act 1854]] – a religious test on admission that was comparable to that for joining the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael George Brock|author2=Mark Charles Curthoys|title=Nineteenth-century Oxford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bDAWHbXgi4C&amp;pg=PA220|accessdate=9 July 2013|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-951016-0|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation at the [[University of Cambridge]] was that a statutory test was required to take a bachelor's degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lancet London: A Journal of British and Foreign Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics, Physiology, Chemistry, Pharmacology, Public Health and News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LBlAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=9 July 2013|year=1853|publisher=Elsevier|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[English Dissenters]] in this context were [[Nonconformism|Nonconformist]] [[Protestants]] who could not in good conscience subscribe (i.e. conform) to [[Thirty-Nine Articles|the beliefs of the Church of England]]. As they were debarred from taking degrees in the only two English universities, many of them attended the dissenting academies. If they could afford it, they completed their education at the universities of [[Leiden University|Leyden]], [[Utrecht University|Utrecht]], [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]] or [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], the last, particularly, those who were studying medicine or law.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert McLachlan, ''English education under the Test Acts: being the history of the nonconformist academies, 1662–1820''; Manchester University Press, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many students attending Utrecht were supported by the [[Presbyterian Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Bolam, et al.; ''The English Presbyterians''; London, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the religious reasons mattered most, the geography of university education also was a factor. The plans for a [[Durham College (17th-century)|Durham College]] of [[Oliver Cromwell]] provided an attempt to break the educational monopoly of [[Oxbridge]], and while it failed because of [[Restoration (1660)|the political change in 1660]], the founder of [[Rathmell Academy]] was [[Richard Frankland (tutor)|Richard Frankland]], who may have been involved in the Durham College project. Almost as soon as dissenting academies began to appear, Frankland was backed by those who wished to see an independent university-standard education available in the north of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Frankland, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tutors in the academies were initially drawn from [[Great Ejection|the ejected ministers of 1662]], who had left the Church of England after the passing of the [[Uniformity Act of 1662|Uniformity Act]], and many of whom had English university degrees. After that generation, some tutors did not have those academic credentials to support their reputations, although in many cases other universities, particularly the Scottish institutions that were sympathetic to their Presbyterian views, awarded them [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorates]].

==Funding==
There were several sources of funding. Some of these funds gave their trustees the option of sending young men either to dissenting academies, or to universities abroad. An academy, to attract such students, had to offer a course of instruction approved of by the Board for its purposes. Funding might be central or local, and there could be doctrinal as well as practical reasons why a given academy was sent students with financial support.

The Common Fund Board, founded in 1689, gave scholarships to [[English Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] and [[Congregational church|Congregational]] candidates for the ministry; its successor, the Presbyterian Fund Board, continued into the middle of the nineteenth century. An education at a dissenting academy was not the only option for the Fund Board, since a candidate could also be sponsored at a Scottish university, or elsewhere. A gap opened up between the Presbyterians and Congregationalists, as the [[Independent (religion)|Independent]]s started to be called, for reasons of doctrine.

The Independent or Congregational Fund Board was established in 1695 to assist poor ministers, and to give young men who had already received a [[classics|classical education]], the theological and other training preparatory to the Christian ministry.&lt;ref name="IP54a"/&gt; An early sign of the division between Presbyterians and Independents was the fate of the [[Rathmell Academy]] after the death of Frankland in 1698: it migrated to Manchester under John Chorlton,&lt;ref&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Chorlton, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another academy under [[Timothy Jollie]], an Independent, operated at [[Attercliffe]] (one of the locations of Frankland's migratory academy) from the 1690s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Jollie, Timothy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1730, the [[King's Head Society]] was founded by laymen in London (after the pub behind the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] at which they met) who were dissatisfied with the management of the Congregational Fund Board. The chief point of objection was the Academies' rule which limited students to those who had already passed through a [[Classics|classical training]], including the demanding and lengthy training period required for learning to read Greek and Latin texts. The King's Head Society resolved to found an academy where young men without a general classical education would receive it during their first two years and could then proceed to the usual classical-theological course.&lt;ref name="IP54b"/&gt;

The [[Coward Trust]] from 1743 funded [[Daventry Academy]] and a London academy under [[David Jennings (tutor)|David Jennings]], but was distinct from the ordinary Congregational funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Jennings, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal position==
The letter of the law could make the running of a dissenting academy difficult or impossible. In the general framework according to which schools must be licensed by the bishop, and ministers (who made up most of the teaching staff) could be in legal trouble for the activities that held together their congregations, some academies simply shut down. For a short period (1714 to 1719) the [[Schism Act 1714|Schism Act]] was in force, and aimed precisely to do that; but the troubles of the academies were mostly before this legislation.

Proceedings in [[Ecclesiastical court#Anglican Communion|ecclesiastical courts]] were quite common in the 17th century, for example in the case of the tutor [[Benjamin Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Robinson, Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of religious toleration in the later half of the seventeenth century varied considerably according to laws passed by Parliament, and also in line with the public mood. Some academies, such as that of John Shuttlewood,&lt;ref&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Shuttlewood, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; operated in remote areas of the countryside, and some tutors were required to leave towns where they had previously performed their ministry, for example under the [[Five Mile Act]]. The [[Toleration Act 1688|Toleration Act of 1689]] under the reign of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] did not mention the dissenters' academies, and proceedings continued against dissenting tutors throughout the 1690s. There were also cases of actions against dissenting [[grammar school]]s, for example the proceedings against [[Isaac Gilling]] in the 1710s. In 1723 the ''[[regium donum]]'', initially a grant to support Irish Presbyterians, became a national subsidy, and subsequently dissenting academies were more generally accepted.

==Nature of the academies==
Several early academies became associated with particular theological positions. [[Richard Frankland (tutor)|Richard Frankland]] of [[Rathmell Academy]] and [[Timothy Jollie]] of [[Attercliffe]], founders of two of the most celebrated early academies, opposed any departure from [[Calvinism|Calvinist theology]]. It was rumoured that Jollie even forbade mathematics ‘as tending to scepticism and infidelity', although several of his students later became extremely proficient in the mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Bolam, et al.; op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; Some academies were more broadminded in their teaching methodology, and in their attitudes towards possible methods of church governance. Indeed, several students at dissenting academies later became Anglicans. The dissenters themselves argued that their academies had stricter discipline than the universities, and were perceived by many to have promoted a more contemporary curriculum based on the practical sciences and modern history. In some of the larger academies French and High Dutch (German) were taught.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert McLachlan, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; The tutors and the students of the dissenting academies contributed in fundamental ways to the development of ideas, notably in the fields of theology, philosophy, literature, and science.

These academies were funded partly by fees for tuition and lodging, as many of them were run in large houses as boarding establishments. They were also funded by philanthropic Dissenters such as [[William Coward (philanthropist)|William Coward]] (1647–1738), whose "will set up a [[trust fund]] ‘for the education and training up of young men … to qualify them for the ministry of the gospel among the Protestant Dissenters’, thus continuing the financial support he had given to such students in his lifetime".&lt;ref&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Coward, William (d.1738)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes this funding was organised along the lines of subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Lewis in ''A Topographical Dictionary of England'' (1831), under the entry for Highbury&lt;/ref&gt;

The Independent or Congregational Fund Board was established in 1695 (i) to assist poor ministers, (2) to give young men who had already received a classical education, the theological and other training preparatory to the Christian ministry.&lt;ref name="IP54a"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Parker |first1= Irene |authorlink1= |title= Dissenting academies in England: their rise and progress, and their place among the educational systems of the country |url= https://archive.org/details/dissentingacadem00parkiala/ |format= |accessdate=  |year=1914 &amp; 2009|publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-521-74864-3|oclc=  |doi= |id= |page=54 |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1730, the King's Head Society was founded by laymen in London who were dissatisfied with the management of the Fund Academies. The chief point of objection was the Fund Academies rule which limited its students to those who had already passed through a classical training. The founder of the  King's Head Society  resolved to found an academy with a six years' course, where young men, without a general classical education, would receive it during the first two years and could then proceed to the usual classical-theological course.&lt;ref name="IP54b"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Parker |first1= Irene |authorlink1= |title= Dissenting academies in England: their rise and progress, and their place among the educational systems of the country |url= https://archive.org/details/dissentingacadem00parkiala/ |format= |accessdate=  |year=1914 &amp; 2009|publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-521-74864-3|oclc=  |doi= |id= |page= |pages=54–55 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century the academies’ original purpose to provide a [[higher education]] was largely superseded by the founding of the [[University of London]] and the provincial universities, which were open to dissenters, and by the reform of Oxford and Cambridge.

==Notable examples==
{{details|List of dissenting academies}}

===London area===
[[Newington Green]], in those days a village north of London, had several academies. [[Charles Morton (educator)|Charles Morton]] (1626–1698), the educator and minister who ended his career as vice-president of [[Harvard College]], ran an influential academy;&lt;ref name="IP58"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Parker |first1= Irene |authorlink1= |title= Dissenting academies in England |url= https://archive.org/details/dissentingacadem00parkiala/ |format= |accessdate=  |year=1914 &amp; 2009|publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-521-74864-3|oclc=  |doi= |id= |page= |pages=58–59 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' judges Morton's "probably the most impressive of the dissenting academies [prior to 1685], enrolling as many as fifty pupils at a time". The ''ODNB'' goes on to describe its advanced and varied curriculum (religion, classics, history, geography, mathematics, natural science, politics, and modern languages) and a well-equipped laboratory, and even "a bowling green for recreation". Lectures were given in English, not Latin, and [[Daniel Defoe]], one of Morton's students, praised its attention to the mother tongue. [[Samuel Wesley (poet)|Samuel Wesley the elder]], a contemporary of Defoe's, described his teacher "as universal in his learning", although he also attacked the academy on uncertain grounds for promoting king-killing doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' article on Morton.&lt;/ref&gt; Rev. [[James Burgh]], author of ''The Dignity of Human Nature'' and ''Thoughts on Education'', opened his dissenting academy there in 1750.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Lyndall (2005), Vindication: A Life of Mary Wollstonecraft. Virago Press. Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; (His widow acted as a "[[fairy godmother]]" in helping the early feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] move her fledgling [[boarding school]] for girls from [[Islington]] to the Green in 1784,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p40.&lt;/ref&gt; finding her a house to rent and twenty students to fill it.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p38.&lt;/ref&gt;) [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]], so closely associated with other leading dissenting academies, chose to spend the latter third of her life in Newington Green.

[[Homerton College, Cambridge]] started life as the dissenting academy [[Independent College, Homerton]], then another village north of London.

===West Country===
The [[Tewkesbury Academy]], set up by [[Samuel Jones, academy tutor|Samuel Jones]], had as its students both [[dissenters]] such as [[Samuel Chandler]] and those who became significant establishment figures such as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Thomas Secker]] and [[Joseph Butler]].&lt;ref name="IP96b"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Parker |first1= Irene |authorlink1= |title= Dissenting academies in England |url= https://archive.org/details/dissentingacadem00parkiala/ |format= |accessdate=  |year=1914 &amp; 2009|publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-521-74864-3|oclc=  |doi= |id= |page=|pages=96–101  |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Davies, ''The Tewkesbury Academy with sketches of its tutor and students'' [1905]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheriffhales Academy, Shropshire (1663–1697) under the Rev. John Woodhouse.&lt;ref name="IP69"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Parker |first1= Irene |authorlink1= |title= Dissenting academies in England|url= https://archive.org/details/dissentingacadem00parkiala/ |format= |accessdate=  |year=1914 &amp; 2009|publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-521-74864-3|oclc=  |doi= |id= |page= |pages=69–72 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Midlands===
Rev. [[Philip Doddridge]] D.D. was chosen in 1723 to conduct the academy being newly established at [[Market Harborough]]. It moved many times, and was known as Northampton Academy, Doddridge died in 1751 and the academy continued.&lt;ref name="IP77"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Parker |first1= Irene |authorlink1= |title= Dissenting academies in England |url= https://archive.org/details/dissentingacadem00parkiala/ |format= |accessdate=  |year=1914 &amp; 2009|publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-521-74864-3|oclc=  |doi= |id= |page= |pages=77–90 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is probably best known as [[Daventry Academy]], which [[Joseph Priestley]] attended. The academy ended up in London under the name of Coward College, as it was largely supported by the bequest of [[William Coward (merchant)|William Coward]] who died 1738.&lt;ref name="IP96a"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Parker |first1= Irene |authorlink1= |title= Dissenting academies in England |url= https://archive.org/details/dissentingacadem00parkiala/ |format= |accessdate=  |year=1914 &amp; 2009|publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-521-74864-3|oclc=  |doi= |id= |page=96 |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The college was one of three that amalgamated in 1850 into [[New College London]]. [[Hugh Farmer]] was educated at this college in its earlier days.

Shrewsbury Academy was started by James Owen in 1702. Owen died 1706 and his place was filled by Samuel Benion, M.D. The academy continued to until Benion's death in 1708.&lt;ref name="IP72"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Parker |first1= Irene |authorlink1= |title= Dissenting academies in England |url= https://archive.org/details/dissentingacadem00parkiala/ |format= |accessdate=  |year=1914 &amp; 2009|publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-521-74864-3|oclc=  |doi= |id= |page= |pages=72–74 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North of England===
[[Warrington Academy]], known as “the Athens of the North” for its stimulating intellectual atmosphere, led eventually, via [[Manchester]] and [[York]], to [[Harris Manchester College, Oxford]]. In 1757 the Rev. John Seddon, a young minister in Warrington, established the academy. Among the tutors were [[Joseph Priestley]] (1761–67) and [[Johann Reinhold Forster]], a German scholar and naturalist. Forster went with Captain Cook in his second voyage round the world.&lt;ref name="IP105"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Parker |first1= Irene |authorlink1= |title= Dissenting academies in England |url= https://archive.org/details/dissentingacadem00parkiala/ |format= |accessdate=  |year=1914 &amp; 2009|publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-521-74864-3|oclc=  |doi= |id= |page=|pages=105–130  |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dorothy Bird Nyswander''' (September 29, 1894 – December 18, 1998), was an American health educator. She graduated with masters and bachelor's degrees from the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] and a Ph.D. in Psychology from the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. She is considered the Mother of [[Health education]].

==Professional life and vision==
Her career spanned over six decades and several continents. During this time, Nyswander was an advocate for community health and rights. As a single mother, she taught in high school while earning her [[doctorate]]. She worked for the [[Works Progress Administration]] during the [[Great Depression]]; advocated working mothers’ child care while employed with the [[Federal Works Agency]]; and promoted preventive school health as the director of Queen’s City Health Center.

In 1943, Nyswander became instrumental in founding the [[UC Berkeley School of Public Health|Berkeley School of Public Health]]. In 1946 she became a full-time professor at UC Berkeley and remained there for nearly 12 years. Following her retirement, in 1957, and at age 62, Dorothy Nyswander then began a 16-year career with the [[World Health Organization]] travelling to [[Jamaica]], [[Turkey]], [[Brazil]], the South Seas, and [[India]] developing health education programs. She is said to have regretted not getting into politics. However, in her words "but you don't get to do everything you want in this life" {{Harvard citation| McBroom | 1994|p=1 }}.&lt;ref name ="McBroom"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Nyswander was committed to an "Open Society.”  In 1966 she defined an open society as "one where justice is the same for every [person]; where dissent is taken seriously as an index of something wrong or something needed; where diversity is expected; . . . where the best of health care is available to all; where poverty is a community disgrace not an individual’s weakness; [and] where desires for power over [people] become satisfaction with the use of power for people”  {{Harvard citation| Nyswander | 1982 }}.&lt;ref&gt;Nyswander, ''The Philosophical, Behavioral and Professional Bases for Health Education'', 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

==SOPHE==
In 1996, two years prior to her death, the California Chapter of the [[Society for Public Health Education]] (NC-SOPHE) began awarding the Dorothy B. Nyswander Award for Leadership in Health Education for health educators who have demonstrated the professional standards set forth by Nsywander.&lt;ref name="NCSOPHE"&gt;SOPHE (2005).

&lt;/ref&gt;  The first recipient was [[Helen Ross]], former Chair of the [[San José State University]] MPH Program. Subsequent recipients include Kathleen Roe, former MPH Program Director and chair of the SJSU Health Science Department since 2002; Meredith Minkler, Professor of Health and Social Behavior at UC Berkeley, and Kate Lorig, Professor in the [[Stanford University Department of Medicine]] and Director of Patient Education Research Center. In 2005, the national Society for Public Health Education created the Open Society Award to honor Dorothy's legacy. The award is given each year to recognize an individual or group who embodies and promotes an [[Open Society]], through research, practice, and/or teaching.

[[File:Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes.jpg|thumb|An elementary school class in Japan]]
{{Nihongo|'''Elementary school'''|小学校|Shōgakkō}} in Japan is compulsory.&lt;ref name="web-japan1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/explore/schools/ |title=Schools - Explore Japan - Kids |publisher=Web Japan |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; All children begin [[first grade]] in the April after they turn six&lt;ref name="web-japan1"/&gt;--[[kindergarten]] is growing increasingly popular, but is not mandatory—and starting school is considered a very important event in a child's life.

== History ==
In the [[Edo period]], some children attended [[terakoya]] or temple schools where they learned practical methods of reading, writing, and calculation.

In 1886, the modern elementary school system started as [[compulsory education]]. Until 1947, only elementary schools were compulsory. Immediately before and during [[World War II]], state education was used as a [[propaganda]] tool by the [[Japanese fascism|Japanese fascist]] government.

Today virtually all elementary education takes place in public schools. Tuition to these schools is free, although families have to pay for school lunches, supplies, and non-school expenses such as extra books or lessons.

Less than 1% of the schools are private,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=私立学校の振興|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/koutou/shinkou/main5_a3.htm|website=Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; partly because of the latter's expense. Some private elementary schools are prestigious, and they serve as a first step to higher-level private schools with which they are affiliated and thence to a [[university]]. Competition to enter some of these "ladder schools" is quite intense.

Elementary school classes are large, typically between thirty and forty students each.&lt;ref name="web-japan1"/&gt; Students are usually organized into small work groups, which have both academic and disciplinary functions.&lt;ref name="web-japan1"/&gt;

==Courses of Study==
The ministry's Course of Study for Elementary Schools is composed of a wide variety of subjects both academic and nonacademic.

Academic subjects include Japanese language, [[social studies]], [[arithmetic]], and [[science]].&lt;ref name="web-japan1"/&gt; Japanese language is an emphasized subject due to the complexity of the [[Japanese writing system|written language]] and the diversity of its spoken forms in formal speech to seniors ([[keigo]]). The English Language is taught at some schools especially in the higher grades;&lt;ref name="web-japan1"/&gt; it is now mandatory at [[5th grade|5th]] and 6th grade from 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tang |first=Warren M |url=http://corpora.wordpress.com/2008/04/05/primary-schools-to-teach-285-english-words-in-2011/ |title=Japanese primary schools to teach 285 English words in 2011 – Warren M Tang |publisher=Corpora.wordpress.com |date=2008-04-05 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in 2002 [[TOEFL]] scores in Japan were the worst in Asia after North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/japan-econ/DF27Dh01.html |title=Japan |publisher=Atimes.com |date=2002-06-27 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonacademic subjects taught include art (including [[Japanese calligraphy]]) and handicrafts, music, [[haiku]] or Japanese traditional poetry, [[homemaking]], [[physical education]], and [[moral education]].&lt;ref name="web-japan1"/&gt; Children also take part in "special activities," scheduled time each week to take care of class business, plan for field trips and ceremonies, and similar tasks.

"Information technology is increasingly being used to enhance education, and most schools have access to the Internet."&lt;ref name="web-japan1"/&gt; There is a system of [[educational television]] and radio, and almost all elementary schools use programs prepared by the School Education Division of Japan's ex Broadcasting Corporation ([[Nippon Hoso Kyokai]]—NHK).

==Daily life==
Both Japanese elementary and middle schools begin around 7:50 AM, with lessons starting at 8:30 AM.&lt;ref name="web-japan2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/explore/schools/q9.html |title=A Day at School - Schools - Explore Japan - Kids |publisher=Web Japan |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese schools do not have school buses, both because of the small size of most school districts and because of the availability of public transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/explore/schools/q5.html |title=Ways to School - Schools - Explore Japan - Kids |publisher=Web Japan |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first fifteen minutes of each day is set aside for either a schoolwide assembly (on Monday mornings) or attendance and announcements in homeroom.&lt;ref name="web-japan2"/&gt;

Classes are between 40 and 45 minutes each, with a break of 5 to 10 minutes in-between.&lt;ref name="web-japan2"/&gt;

===Lunch===
{{See also|School lunch#Japan}}
After four morning classes, at about 12:30 PM, students are sent to pick up their homeroom's lunches from the school kitchens.&lt;ref name="web-japan2"/&gt; Lunches are typically served in [[bento]] boxes, with small portions of a variety of freshly prepared foods.

These include "a whole range of meats, fishes, vegetables, and sea plants. A typical meal consists of stew or curry, boiled vegetables, a sandwich, and salad. Milk is served with each meal. Usually, there is also dessert, such as gelatin, ice cream, and fruit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/explore/schools/q2.html |title=Lunches - Schools - Explore Japan - Kids |publisher=Web Japan |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because there are relatively few cafeterias in elementary schools, meals are taken in the classroom with the teacher, providing another informal opportunity for teaching [[nutrition]], health, good eating habits and social behavior. All students eat the same lunch, and are assigned to shifts for serving lunch to their homeroom.&lt;ref name="web-japan2"/&gt;  Lunch lasts about 40 minutes.&lt;ref name="web-japan2"/&gt;

===Afternoons===
In some lower elementary school, classes are over after lunch and children are allowed to go home.&lt;ref name="web-japan2"/&gt; Upper elementary students in those schools have one more class after lunch.&lt;ref name="web-japan2" /&gt; However, other schools have a 5 or 6 classes per day, with only the youngest students not having a sixth period. Some schools allow for a 20-minute recess in-between, which is sometimes used for [[Housekeeping|cleaning]] the classrooms: sweeping, mopping, throwing away trash, etc. Students then usually leave school around three o'clock.&lt;ref name="web-japan2" /&gt;

After-school clubs like sports and English club are offered at elementary schools, but unlike middle and high school clubs these usually meet only once a week.&lt;ref name="web-japan2"/&gt;

==Problems==
Japanese elementary schooling is seen{{Who|date=July 2010}} as effective, but not without some problems, notably increasing absenteeism and [[school refusal]] and a troublesome amount of [[bullying]] (77,630 reported cases in 2010 throughout the school system)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/77630-school-bullying-cases-recognized-in-2010 Japan Today]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, special provision for the young children returning to Japan from long periods spent overseas is an issue. The government also is concerned with the education of Japanese children residing abroad. However, in most urban centers there are at least private [[international school]]s which can accommodate such returnees.

===Controversies===
A new course of study was established in 1989, partly as a result of the education reform movement of the 1980s and partly because of ongoing [[curriculum]] review. Important changes scheduled were an increased number of hours devoted to Japanese language, the replacement of the social sciences course with a daily life course- -instruction for children on proper interaction with the society and environment around them—and an increased emphasis on moral education. New emphasis also was to be given in the curriculum to the [[Hinomaru|national flag]] and the [[Japanese national anthem]]. The [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|ministry]] suggested that the flag be flown and the national anthem sung at important school ceremonies. Because neither the flag nor the anthem had been legally designated as national symbols, and because of the [[nationalist]]ic [[World War II|wartime]] associations the two had in the minds of some citizens, this suggestion was greeted with opposition.

'''Eligio Pichardo''' (1929&amp;ndash;1984) was a painter from the [[Dominican Republic]]. He worked in [[Santo Domingo]] and [[New York City]], producing [[Expressionist]] and [[Abstract Expressionist]] works.

==Early life and education==
Pichardo was born in [[Salcedo, Hermanas Mirabal|Salcedo]], [[Hermanas Mirabal Province]], and raised in [[San Francisco de Macorís]], [[Duarte Province]].

He enrolled in the [[National School of Fine Arts]] in [[Santo Domingo]] in 1945, studying under [[José Vela Zanetti]] and alongside [[Clara Ledesma]] and [[Gilberto Hernández Ortega]]. His early work was greatly influenced by Dominican artists [[José Vela Zanetti|Vela Zanetti]], [[Jaime Colson]] and [[Darío Suro]].

==Career==
[[File:Eligio Pichardo 01.jpg|right|thumb|''El Sacrificio del Chivo'' (''Sacrifice of the Goat''), [[oil on canvas]], 1958 (Santo Domingo, Museo de Arte Moderno)]]
In the early 1950s, Pichardo painted hundreds of murals in schools throughout Santo Domingo. Themes included the [[history of the Dominican Republic]] and [[Don Quixote]].

He participated in important biennial art exhibitions held throughout the world, including [[São Paulo]], [[Madrid]] and [[Paris]]. In 1951, he won a prize at the [[Madrid Biennial]]. Three years later he received a scholarship from the [[Instituto de Cultura Hispánica]] to study in Madrid. During his time in Europe, he was influenced by the work of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Jean Dubuffet]].

After returning to Santo Domingo, he became a professor at the National School of Fine Arts. He had several solo exhibitions and participated in biennial art shows. He won the [[Santo Domingo Biennial]] in 1958 with his painting ''El Sacrificio del Chivo'' (''Sacrifice of the Goat'').

In 1961, after signing with "The Contemporaries" gallery in [[Manhattan]], Pichardo moved to New York City. He had his first solo exhibition in the city in 1962. Later, his work was exhibited in the Sarduy Gallery.

The artist continued to live and work in New York City until 1978, when he returned to Santo Domingo.

==Death==
Pichardo died at age 54&amp;ndash;55.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43865">The '''European History Network''' has run a number of projects under the banner of the Creating Links and Overviews for a New History Agenda (CLIOH) since 1988, including CLIOH, CLIOHnet and CLIOHnet2. Both CLIOHRES and CLIOH-WORLD are currently in operation as of December 2011. It was initially founded as the ECTS History Network, a pilot project of the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]].

==CLIOH-WORLD==

It builds on the efforts of previous European History Network projects (CLIOH, CLIOHnet,&lt;ref&gt;
[http://meldinger.uib.no/engelsk.php?id=51001123731 University of Bergen news]&lt;/ref&gt; CLIOHnet2, CLIOHRES) to improve the understanding of national histories as they are studied, taught and learned in European universities. These projects have linked national historical narratives, and prepared tools and materials to structure history programs. These help make learners aware of how national historical viewpoints have been created, and how and why they may contrast with the beliefs and understandings about history in neighboring countries.

CLIOH-WORLD is using its consolidated experience and methodology to develop the learning and teaching of [[European Union]] history, including [[European integration]] and expansion, and to encourage awareness and understanding of the links between European history and the histories of other continents. CLIOH-WORLD has five working groups:

=== Working groups ===

==== 1. History of European Integration and of the European Union ====
'''Why is there a need for the History of EU and European Integration?'''

History is an important tool not only for increasing knowledge of the human past, but also for enhancing the awareness and the identity of human social and political communities, of which the [[European Union]] is one. In order to achieve a better understanding of what the European Union is and what it means to be a European citizen it is essential to improve the knowledge and understanding of both the history of the European integration process and the history of the European Union itself. Universities are an important place where students can acquire such essential knowledge and awareness in a mature way.

European Union History is not the same as the History of [[European Integration]] and vice versa: the two terms cover different aspects of European History. The main focus of the History of the European Union is on the history of a very dense kind of European Integration, centred on institutionalised forms of integration and on the member states of the European Union.

On the contrary, the History of European Integration also covers aspects of integration that go beyond the European Union. Moreover, to reach a mature comprehension of the complex political, social, economic and juridical framework in which the EU has been conceived and built, it is important to broaden our view back in history before 1945 and [[World War II]]. One of the most obvious tools of analysis that history offers is ‘historical perspective’, the diachronic dimension that provides important insights into present-day phenomena. The understanding of long term aspects, events and processes, is also vital in building a critically aware European citizenship.

The task of the [[Working group|Working Group]] is to increase both knowledge and understanding of the European integration process and the history of the European Union. In order to reach such important goals the group has decided to map the current situation and to produce and disseminate Guidelines and Reference points for Higher Education programmes in Europe. Our{{Who|date=January 2011}} findings are offered freely as information, ideas and recommendations. The tools produced by the group can be adopted by or may simply inspire those who face the need to (re)design history programmes.

'''The Role of History of EU and European Integration on European Universities: the Mapping Results'''

The Working Group undertook an extensive survey of the current state of European Union and European Integration History learning and teaching, through detailed mapping of selected countries (Austria, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the UK), and supplemented this with further sample-based mapping of other countries in Europe (Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, Malta, Romania) and beyond Europe (Japan). On this basis the Group feels confident that it has produced a reasonably representative basis on which to assess the field.

Although the mapping covered a broad and diverse range of countries and institutions, a number of common points were evident. In particular, it was striking that there is very little learning/teaching specifically dedicated to the history of the European Union or European integration. Courses devoted to these subjects are overwhelmingly oriented towards political science, legal or linguistic studies. Where there was evidence of a historical approach to the subject it tended to be framed within either national histories (the relations between one state and the rest of Europe) or included in general histories of Europe, wherein the history of the EU and of European integration was treated either as a discrete part of the whole or implicitly (rather than explicitly) embedded in studies of post-1945 west European political and economic development.

The difficulty of identifying historical approaches to the subject underlined the problems of defining what that history is, however. There are a number of issues that make a neat definition of European Union history and the history of European integration problematic. These are principally chronological and thematic. If we seek to add a historical dimension to existing institutional studies of the European Union and of European integration, for example, questions arise about cultural and historical connections (what might be termed ‘European-ness’) which in turn open up problems of periodisation (specifically, whether an exclusively post-1945 focus is adequate, but if not how should the chronological parameters be defined?).

The importance of history in programmes of European Studies is in fact not very pronounced, although history is often mentioned in the programme descriptions. Even where European Union history is reasonably well covered, it is usually as one optional module, a fact which raises issues about coherence, or the importance of thinking about what that History is. Although dealing with “Europe” is quite popular in European academic institutions and many universities and departments offer courses on “European history” or the history of European regions, an explicit focus on European History or the history of European integration is not very widespread.

“European history” is often seen as history that happened in Europe or parts of it, not in a comparative way that contrasts or connects different structures and addresses the process of European integration. With these problems and questions in mind, it was possible to return to the original mapping results with a view to identifying ‘interesting’ practice that might illuminate some of these issues and how they had been addressed, and allow the Group to move towards a more meaningful interpretation of what constitutes European Union history and the history of European integration. It is these results that are to be used to inform the development of guidelines framed within the language and methodology of Tuning.

'''What can we learn from examples of good and interesting practice?'''

Examples of good and interesting practice{{According to whom|date=January 2011}} can be found in all of the countries that were mapped in detail. These examples can be found on several levels.
1.) On the level of programmes it is seen{{By whom|date=January 2011}} as good practice if courses on European Union history and the history of European integration are a – preferably compulsory – part of programmes of European studies or European history.

2.) Courses are seen as good and interesting practice if they cover European Union history and history of European integration in a way that goes beyond an institutional history of the European Union and its organisations. Some selected examples will illustrate these examples of good and interesting practice. At the beginning of the Masters programme “Sociology – European societies“ (Freie Universität Berlin [DE]) there is a module that deals with “the process of political integration in Europe and the development of European societies after 1945”.

The link between European integration and the development of societies broadens the horizon of the history of European integration. Critical views on the process of integration are also presented in a lecture series forming part of the Master of European Studies (MES) offered by the Europa-Universität Viadrina, Frankfurt on Oder (DE). What is interesting{{According to whom|date=January 2011}} in this example is also the interior multi-disciplinary approach, also used in other courses such as “Interdisciplinary Analysis of EU“ (in the “Integrated Studies of Europe” Programme, Universität Bremen [DE] ).

Here topics such as cultural pluralism and “European identity” or the transformation of the welfare state and “social Europe” are dealt with. The latter topic is the main focus of the Master in European Union Studies offered at Paris-Lodron Universität, Salzburg (AT). Here, courses on social and economic history in the longue durée (18th – 21st centuries) and courses that put EU integration in a pan-European and global framework can be seen as examples of good practice. That is also the case in a course on “Transnational History” at St Andrews (UK) that deals with the interconnections between European societies and non-European regions from the 18th century. That the history of integration after 1945 is very much affected by historical events that happened before 1945 is dealt with in a course on “European History since 1945” (University College, University of London [UK])

There particular attention is paid to the impact of experiences and memories of war, occupation, resistance and the holocaust in the period after 1945. Also the programme in European Studies (M.E.S.) at the University of Vienna, Austria, offers compulsory courses on “Plans for Europe in a historical context before 1945” and “Basics of European integration politics on a historical foundation”. A comparative and transnational approach to the idea of Europe in a long durée perspective is pursued in the second cycle programme in “European Historical Studies” at the University of Évora (Portugal).

Emphasis on the above-mentioned aspect of “European-ness” can be seen in several courses, such as “Culture and Identities in a Contested Continent” (Open University, UK). Here, Europe is defined as a contested and a dynamic space, rather than as a fixed geographical entity. Ideas and concepts of Europe are also part of the programmes on the European Union and European integration at the University of Coimbra (Portugal) that are mainly taught from a historical perspective.

The Faculty of Humanities (Letters) of the University of Coimbra emerges as an example of interesting practice due to the strong presence of the subject across a range of scopes and levels: from a single course unit on EU history compulsory for history students to first and second cycle programmes on European Studies where History is one of the five major fields of research. It can be considered good practice to offer joint studies that stress a broad transnational perspective. The University of Coimbra is – as one example among many – a member of a network of Universities that, with the support of the European Commission, organises a Master in European Studies: “The Process of Building Europe“.

'''Good practice in EU and European Integration history'''

As the group mapped the situation and took a deeper look at examples of good and interesting practice, several factors emerged that – by integrating historical approaches – are useful for improving learning and teaching of European Union and European integration history:

# Placing recent decades in a longue durée perspective, including history before 1945.
# Dealing with aspects of European-ness (perceptions and representations, memory and history), hence with cultural and social history as well as with institutional history.
# Analysing ‘integration’ as a complex process that comprises both integration and disintegration.
# Adding a view of European history from outside Europe and analysing the links of European societies with non-European regions.
# Adopting an inter and multi-disciplinary approach.
# Offering joint programmes on the basis of cooperation between universities. These general findings can be elaborated and specified in terms of key competences seen as useful for students in programmes that deal with European Union and European integration history.

'''What should we know, understand and be able to do? Key Competences in EU-history and the History of European Integration'''

According to the Tuning Educational Structures in Europe project, the objective of single course modules and degree programmes is to develop “competences”, in the broadest sense, in the learner. In substance the central element in organising the learning process is what the person involved will know, understand and be able to do at the end of it.

Attitude too, in this case the historical mind-set or approach, is fundamental. Using the Tuning results of the History Subject Area Group as a starting point, we have examined in depth a number of key competences to be developed in studies in the area of the History of the European Union and European Integration. These may be exemplified by the following:

'''A critical awareness of the relationship between current events in the EU and processes in the past and awareness of differences in historiographical outlooks in various periods and contexts'''

Learners should be aware that EU history does not start with European integration in the form of the European communities after 1945 and that processes and structures going further back than 1945 strongly influence the present situation in the EU and the perception of the EU by its inhabitants. Learners should be aware that current events are often seen through an inherited perspective that is historically based in national and regional frameworks.

Knowledge of the history of Europe is necessary to be able to interpret the different perceptions of current events in various European nations and regions. The knowledge that the learners should acquire in order to be aware of a relationship between current events and processes in the past is not primarily based on simple facts and dates but also on a knowledge of basic structures, the economic and social situation, demography, religion and political systems.

Learners should also be able to identify the role of national or regional myths and interpret the often “invented“ significance of certain historical events in the context of the “identities” forged by European nations and their instrumental use and propagation in national/nationalistic historiography.

'''Ability to place events and structures in historical perspective'''

While a literal interpretation of European Union history – its institutional history / development since 1945 – can be reasonably easily defined and adds to legal and political science approaches, it is important that students also develop an appreciation of European history that predates World War II. Students should be able to demonstrate an understanding of the complex and contested historical origins of the European Union and be able to justify their chosen definition of what constitutes EU history.

This will require them to understand the complementary and divergent natures of specific (e.g. local or national) histories within the EU (to examine the EU as [more than] the sum of its parts) as well as external perspectives on the EU. They should, therefore, demonstrate an understanding of the multiplicity of EU histories defined both chronologically and geographically. By examining the internal and external histories of the EU, students will be able to define “EU history” and its place in world history.

'''Ability to define suitable research topics to contribute to historiographical knowledge and debate'''

The learner should be able to identify a number of significant studies relating to the history of European integration and cooperation during the 20th and the 21st centuries, including for example the concrete acts regarding it, the ideas surrounding it and the obstacles to it; to connect these works with the historical and political context in which they were produced; and to define the position of the author with respect to the historical, political, methodological and theoretical questions addressed.

The learner should be able, on this basis, to pose new questions for research having the potential to advance knowledge and debate, of a complexity appropriate to the level of study. The learner should be able to elaborate a research plan, organised around bibliography, documents and other sources (oral, written, material), as appropriate to address the questions posed and to revise (broaden, perfect) it in relation to his or her findings.

'''Ability to identify and utilise appropriate sources of information for a research project'''

The European Union is sometimes compared to an onion (as a sphere) with concentric layers. This is because it has a horizontal synchronic geographical segmentation and a diachronic vertical periodization. Learners need to acquire competences that allow them to distinguish, compare and analyse different periods and spaces of European and European Union history. This will require competences in finding, classifying and using critically sources of information appropriate to the historical time period, geographical space or phenomena analysed.

Students should have at least a basic knowledge of the methodology of related disciplines and an ability to use this interdisciplinary methodological arsenal (e.g. International Relations theories, security studies, comparative political sociology and political science theory). Learners should be able to combine sources of different kinds (e.g. treaties, European Union law, the acquis communitaire [the body of EU law established until now], audiovisual materials, press releases, discourses, political programmes) and forms (written, electronic sources, official sites of EU administration), address them with critical awareness and analyse them in the appropriate historical, national, international or EU community context.

'''Interdisciplinarity'''

The learner should be aware of and able to use tools of other human sciences as well as those of the various branches of historical research. This entails understanding that different kinds of history (e.g. economic, political, intellectual, cultural, social, institutional, legal, diplomatic, gender and religious history; history of international relations) as well as other human sciences (anthropology, literary criticism, history of language, art history, archaeology, law, sociology, philosophy) are indispensable tools for creating a critical awareness of the relationship between current events related to EU history and the processes of the past, a critical point in student competences.

Moreover, the learner should understand and be critically aware that many of these different branches of history or human sciences may offer a specific focused viewpoint for analyzing the history of the EU in a more profound way. This kind of perspective allows the learner to perceive the differences between the various approaches to EU history and to European history in a broader sense, fostering critical awareness of the way many political discourses are founded on a specific historical view of Europe and its history.

In fact, many different approaches may be used, both in studying the European Union, and in studying European History, but not all of them are equally correct in terms of historical analysis and methodology: some are functional to particular political points of view and based on revisionist or nationalist perspectives. The history of the European Union is more than the sum of the histories of many different countries plus the history of the European Union itself. The EU, just like European citizenship and European identity, can be considered multi-layered or stratified. It is a complex system and requires a multi-faceted approach.

==== 2. World and Global History ====
{{Emptysection|date=February 2013}}

==== 3. E-learning and Digitisation ====
The arrival of the digital age has transformed and is continuing to transform the study of history and the way it is taught. History has embraced the opportunities presented by digitization and e- learning; it is now grasping the ever-greater possibilities offered and tackling the challenges that come with them. Indeed, history as discipline possesses the necessary tools, particularly in the vital area of source criticism, to evaluate and validate the vast amount of information made available through the new technologies.

Interest in making archival materials and collections available has therefore been widely spread among historians. There are many university-based projects to digitise collections of archival materials, history journals are well represented in scholarly on- line source collections such as [[Project Muse]] and [[JSTOR]], and discussion forums are a regular feature of history modules. The value of such developments for the scholar and student of history are evident.

Digital collections reduce the need to travel to archives, search engines enable relevant material to be found more quickly, the availability of materials online reduces the pressure on paper resources in the library and enable more students to use the same materials simultaneously, and, lastly, e-learning tools provide the opportunity to extend the contact time between teachers and students, and amongst students themselves. E-learning also opens up apparently limitless possibilities for distance learning, allowing students across the globe to learn together online.

There are of course a number of problems associated with digitization and e-learning that have yet to be resolved or that must, at least, be acknowledged alongside the opportunities opened up. Digitization has proceeded unevenly, with, for example, a disproportionate representation of English-language materials, and it often reflects the same biases to be found in more traditional collections of materials: thus men tend to be more visible as historical protagonists than women.

Search engines can limit the unwary scholar to a narrow gaze, only identifying those documents which contain particular terms, while missing others with a more subtle relevance to a particular question, and plucking journal articles and primary materials from their context. In terms of e-learning, teachers and students have both expressed concerns about the extent to which online interaction compares favourably with a more traditional lesson in a classroom.

''' The Importance of Digitization and e-Learning to CLIOHWORLD Project'''

The importance of engaging with the digital world has been understood by all the CLIOH projects, not least the current CLIOHWORLD. CLIOHWORLD maintains a website to facilitate communication with its many members, and also to reach out to a much wider audience of scholars, teachers and students of history. Central to the CLIOHWORLD project is the dissemination of learning materials.

The project has already pioneered making available electronically resources for teaching which represent the latest scholarship on numerous key topics related to thematic and national histories. CLIOHWORLD’s current focus is on improving European citizens’ understanding of their own history, especially the history of integration, while placing Europe in a global context. It is not surprising that in order to achieve this, several of the working groups on the project have produced readers and online teaching guides dedicated to their particular fields, and that more are in preparation.

'''Tasks of the Working Group on Digitization'''

The tasks of the Working Group are threefold: to increase the visibility of CLIOHWORLD online; to map the current use of digital and e-learning resources for teaching purposes in universities; and to produce a report which explores the opportunities and challenges related to recent developments in digitization and e-learning.

'''(1) Increasing visibility of CLIOHWORLD and associated projects'''

One of the wonders of the digital age has been the proliferation of resources online, but this presents the challenge of how to maintain a profile in what can often seem like a jungle of information. Our Working Group has made it a priority to raise the profile of CLIOHWORLD by giving it, and its sister organisation CLIOHRES, a presence on the ubiquitous Wikipedia and creating a CLIOHWORLD page on the increasingly popular social networking site Facebook.

It is particularly appropriate that CLIOHWORLD should be found on both these sites, for it ties in with the project’s aims to reach out across the continent, and now globally, to promote a critical understanding of European history, and to disseminate teaching materials to help learners of all ages study this topic. Links to the considerable resources on European history already available on the CLIOHWORLD website have been included on both pages. As mentioned above, many of the other Working Groups of CLIOHWORLD expect to produce online resources related to their particular themes and links to these can be added as appropriate to Wikipedia and Facebook.

'''(2) Mapping the current use of digital and e-learning resources for teaching purposes in universities'''

It is easy to assume that engagement with digital and e-learning resources is universal and at the same level, yet many universities, and departments within them, are at different stages of taking advantage of the opportunities such resources offer. The Working Group is mapping the use of digital and e-learning resources in the universities of CLIOHWORLD partners using an online survey. We hope to identify what digital resources are being used by individuals and their colleagues to support their teaching; get a sense of the way in which e-learning tools are being utilised to facilitate and enhance student experience; and explore the extent to which such endeavours are supported at a departmental, faculty and institutional level.

The last issue addressed in the questionnaire is the challenges faced by teachers in making use of digital resources and e-learning tools. It is often assumed, for example, that young people are automatically computer literate and skilled in the use of search engines and digital resources, but it is often the case that they require training and support. Tied closely with this is our final question which addresses the issue of competencies.

The Tuning project has identified a number of key competencies which students of history can be expected to demonstrate. Three competences are related to the use of digital and e-learning resources: knowledge of and ability to use information retrieval tools, such as […] e-references; ability to use computer and internet resources for elaborating historical or related data; and ability to identify and utilise appropriately sources of information […] for research projects. We hope to identify the extent to which the competences listed are sufficient to enable a student to use digital materials and e-learning tools.

Our initial results suggest that considerable numbers of university lecturers are making use of some digital resources and e-learning tools, but that not all resources available are used equally. Thus databases of sources are more popular than YouTube videos, and e-learning platforms are used more often than wikis and blogs. Many expressed concerns about the limited nature of training available to staff, which helps explain the disproportionate use of the least challenging digital and e-learning resources. The results from this questionnaire will feed into our third output which is a report.

'''(3) Information gathering on digitization and e-learning'''

The field of digitization and e-learning is fast-moving and Working Group 3 aims to keep CLIOHWORLD abreast of those changes, as well as produce materials that can be used a guide for scholars, teachers and students. Thus, the group is working on a report which builds on and updates the research it conducted for CLIOHnet 2 and explores new developments in digitization and e-learning resources. Three main areas for further research have been identified:

'''(a) Researching history'''

Digital resources have transformed the experience of researching. Comparing the Gutenbergian book format and new digital formats increases our awareness of the opportunities offered and limitations imposed by both media and the experience of using them. As digital resources have increased, so too have digital research aids, like Zotero, and understanding their role and place in global historical research is vital.

Such tools are designed to facilitate the building of international virtual research groups and to enhance the individual researcher’s experience of online research. Questions remain, however, around the extent to which such tools improve scholarly enquiry. Do such tools represent a threat to the traditional historical skills associated with archival research? Similarly, the proliferation of online resources is changing the nature and role of archives and libraries, and it is useful to consider the consequences of these developments.

'''(b) Publishing history'''

Just as digitization is changing the nature of the archiving of primary materials, it is also influencing the publication of secondary materials. Journals are published online as a matter of course and projects to digitise books are underway in a number of guises. It is important to note though that while online journals are extremely popular amongst scholars, there is perhaps still some resistance to reading books online or using the new electronic book readers like Kindle. Other new methods for publishing historical material like Drupal, WordPress and so on also need to be discussed, for they raise wider questions about the effect of open-access publishing and the barriers to achieving this.

'''(c) Teaching history'''

Digital resources and e-learning tools have the potential to enhance teaching. Digital resources relieve pressure on more traditional sources and make available to students previously inaccessible documents and materials. Where digital resources are concerned, however, it is vital that teachers of history also equip students to deal with the challenges they pose. The, at times, lax checks and balances which govern online publishing mean that the unwary may use unreliable or poor quality materials in the place of more scholarly resources.

Universities are also increasingly aware of the opportunities for expanding their reach and recruitment using e-learning tools, with lectures being posted on YouTube and online courses being developed to enable distance learning. Even social networking sites like Facebook and virtual worlds like Second Life are proving to be of use to educational institutions, facilitating communication and, in the latter case, enabling the recreation of artefacts, battlegrounds and even cities of the past.

The Working Group has interviewed one teacher of history on her experiences of using Second Life as a teaching tool and will include details of this case study in the report. As the interview highlighted, questions remain, however, about the extent to which such online interaction is an adequate or satisfying replacement for traditional classroom based activities.

==CLIOHRES==
[http://www.cliohres.net/ CLIOHRES] (“Creating Links and Innovative Overviews for a New History Research Agenda for the Citizens of a Growing Europe") is a Sixth Framework Programme Network of Excellence organized by a group of 45 [[university|universities]], many of which are CLIOH.net members.

A five-year project, it aims at achieving and disseminating greater understanding of both the actual histories and the representations of the past current in Europe today, highlighting both diversities and connections and explaining the development context. It brings together historians, geographers, art historians, linguists, theologists, philologists, sociologists and philosophers in order to explore how differences, connections, conflicts and positive interaction have developed in the past and can develop in the future. It involves 180 research staff and doctoral students from 31 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Communities in European history |last=Pan-Montojo |first=Juan |authorlink= |author2=Frederik Pedersen |year=2007 |publisher=Edizioni Plus |location= |isbn=88-8492-462-6 |page=8 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7aH-tU3x3UC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CLIOHRES has six thematic working groups. They are:

# States, legislation, institutions
# Power and culture, including language, art and architecture
# Religious and Philosophical concepts
# Work, Gender and Society
# Frontiers and Identities
# Europe and the World

=== Work, Gender and Society Thematic Working Group ===
The exact priorities, pathways and specific work-plan of the Thematic Working Group (TWG) of Cliohres responsible for work, gender and society will be defined by the Group and will follow the general scheme outlined. However, on the basis of previous planning, the agenda is to examine the different ways in which society has organized itself in different times and places, with respect to the organization of labor, the definition of gender roles, civic and family structures.

The ways these forms of organization have been or have not been exported to other parts of the world, the extent to which they define a kind of European-ness, or vice versa, the extent to which national, regional and chronological differences are significant within Europe will be examined as will the links with colonial society and with political and economic changes in the role of Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries. The central methodological core around which this TWG will work sees the study of gender as a valuable tool for understanding social evolutions rather than as an end in itself.

'''The Higher Education Act 2004''' (c 8) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that introduced several changes to the [[higher education]] system in the United Kingdom, the most important and controversial being a major change to the funding of [[universities]], and the operation of [[tuition]] fees, which affects [[England and Wales]].  University funding is a [[devolution|devolved matter]] for [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/Publications/Documents/DevolutionAndHE.pdf Devolution and higher education: impact and future trends.]&lt;/ref&gt; After complex and controversial debates, the Higher Education Bill received [[Royal Assent]] on 1 July 2004.

==Background and political importance==
Until 1998, all education in the United Kingdom was free up to and including university courses. However, shortly after coming to power, [[the Labour Party (UK)|the Labour Party]] under [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] abolished the student [[maintenance grant]] system and introduced an up-front fee fixed at just over £1,000 per year for all university [[student]]s. Up to a quarter of this fee was waived for the poorest students, but many maintained that education should remain a free public service, and that the system would place students in unnecessary levels of debt. The [[Her Majesty's Government|government]], however, insisted that fees were the best means of providing university funding. At the same time, they stated that their aim was to increase the proportion of students going on to Higher Education to 50% by 2010.

In the years that followed, it became clear that the original fixed fees of around £1,000 per year were still not providing enough funding, leading to proposals of what are often referred to as ''top-up fees''. The idea was that universities would be able to "top up" the fees to a level that more accurately reflected the funding they needed. However, widespread protests led the Labour Party to make a [[manifesto]] pledge at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]] not to introduce such a system.

In 2003, a new set of proposals was drafted, which were denounced by some as breaking that promise. Although the government tried to create a compromise that would raise the necessary funds in a fair way, the issue remained highly contentious. Despite vocal opposition within his own party, Tony Blair claimed that this proposal was the only way to secure the necessary funds, and the issue was seen as a key test of his leadership. The initial vote in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], on 27 January 2004, came a day before the result of the [[Hutton Inquiry]], and it was predicted that a bad result from one or both would lead to Blair's resignation as Prime Minister. The Bill was passed at the first vote, known as ''second reading'', by 316 votes to 311, with 71 Labour MPs voting against.

The Bill faced further opposition as it progressed through Parliament. There was some controversy regarding the appointment of mainly loyalist MPs to the [[Standing Committee (UK)|Standing Committee]] assigned to review the Bill.  Of the 16 Labour MPs on the committee, only one voted against the government at second reading, and one abstained, suggesting that little criticism was likely during this stage. It then returned to the floor of the Commons for the Report stage. The main opposition to the bill from Labour [[backbencher]]s concerned the "variable" or "top-up" fees, therefore an amendment tabled at Report stage to remove references to these variable fees appeared to have some chance of succeeding. In addition, some backbenchers were promised further concessions and changes to the Bill, and therefore voted in favour at the second reading. If these promises had been felt to have been broken, these members might well have vote against the Bill at ''third reading''.

Additionally, if the Bill had been successfully passed at third reading, it would have moved to the House of Lords, where the Government did not have a majority, and where for this particular Bill, the [[Salisbury Convention]] – according to which legislation included in the manifesto of the ruling party should not be opposed – would not have applied. This is because the policy was not included in the Labour party manifesto in 2001 – and some would argue it went against the line reading "We will not introduce top-up fees and have legislated to prevent them". Therefore, it is quite possible that the Lords would have rejected the bill outright, which would have meant that the government would have had to table the Bill again in the next session of Parliament, and would possibly have had to use the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]] in order to force it through Parliament and gain [[Royal Assent]]. Alternatively, the Lords could have passed a "wrecking amendment" which would have needed to be reversed by the House of Commons.

==Details of the proposed changes to funding==
The Act incorporates several key changes to the financial arrangements of higher education students, including many additional terms that were added to convince those who opposed earlier drafts. The changes took effect in 2006, and apply to England and [[Wales]].
*'''Up-front fees to be replaced by an income-linked deferred payment.''' Instead of having to pay each year while studying, students are to be loaned the funds by the government and repayments will be made out of income once the graduate is earning more than £15000 per year. The loan is charged at the [[Retail Prices Index (United Kingdom)]] rate.
**The payment rates will be entirely earnings based, so that as a graduate's salary fluctuates, so will their fee payments. If their salary falls below £15000, no payments will be taken.
**Additionally, any amount of a student's fees still outstanding after 25 years will be cancelled.
*'''Fixed rate of £1125 to be replaced by variable fees between 0 and £3000.''' Since different courses cost different amounts of money to run, it is argued that students should pay different levels of fees. Under the new system, universities will be able to set the level of the fees for each course, within a given range.
**Although the change does represent a significant increase in the level of fees, some universities had called for much higher rates - in some cases up to £12000 a year. Furthermore, the top rate cannot be increased without a motion being passed in both Houses of Parliament, and the government has promised not to propose such a motion before 2009, assuaging fears that it would rise dramatically soon after the legislation was passed.
**In order to charge more than the basic amount (equivalent to the current fixed rate), a university will have to produce an appropriate "plan", which may have to include details of how students from poorer backgrounds will be encouraged to participate. These plans will be subject to approval and review by a new body called the ''Office for Fair Access'' (''OFFA'', see 'Other Provisions' below).
*'''Increased levels of financial aid.''' As part of the "package" of this reform, increased government grants, and bursaries set up by the universities themselves, will be put in place in such a way that the maximum allowance will equal the maximum fee - i.e. £3000 - for the poorest students. Presently, this will come from several sources, making it hard to understand, but plans to combine the various elements may still be introduced during the committee stage.

==Arguments in favour of the proposals==
The principal argument in favour of a new funding system is that British universities are currently critically underfunded, and an increased level of fees will result in a [[cash injection]] and prevent them collapsing. Additionally, much is made of the need for British institutions to be internationally "competitive" in terms of quality and resources, and that this is impossible to achieve without a reform of their funding.

A key player on this side of the argument is the [[Russell Group of Universities]], who have argued that they should be able to charge much increased fees in order to differentiate themselves from smaller universities. This attitude has proved unpopular, as a [[two-tier]] system of this kind is widely seen{{By whom|date=May 2011}} as unnecessary and damaging. The levels called for by this group far exceed the maximum rate currently proposed.

Further to this argument, it is argued that since studies show that most graduates earn more during their career than non-graduates, it is logical that they should be the ones to pay for this opportunity, not the public at large.  Critics, however, have suggested that if this is the case, they will pay more [[income tax]] anyway, and that this would be a fairer source of the money. Some{{Who|date=May 2011}} have also pointed out that the country as a whole benefits from an increased level of expertise, and therefore it is in everyone's interests to pay for higher education.

==Arguments against the proposals==
The most common criticism of the proposals is that increasing tuition fees will increase the level of debt graduates will have when they leave. Organisations such as the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] have argued that students are already under too much financial pressure, and that this will make things worse, not better. Many students have had to take up [[part-time work]] in order to pay living costs while studying, and this has been shown to have an adverse effect on their results.

Although the Bill removes the need to pay fees up front - meaning that students may have more spending money while studying - it will still leave them with a greater debt at the start of their careers. While it was predicted that people from poorer backgrounds may be put off from enrolling for a degree because of the measure, the number of young people engaged in higher education has actually risen, most markedly in those coming from poorer backgrounds.

A second line of criticism is that the introduction of ''variable'' fees represents a step towards the [[privatisation]] of education, and makes degrees into products quite unnecessarily. Although not the intention of the legislation, there is likely to be a perceived trade-off between price and quality when choosing a degree. The strict limits imposed on fee levels limit this in practice, but the concept of competition remains. This is not, however, so relevant today as the vast majority of universities opt to charge the maximum £3,290 (2010 Entry).

==Other provisions in the Bill==
The Higher Education Bill also includes several less well-known provisions:
*'''Creation of an ''[[Office for Fair Access]]'' (''OFFA'')''' to oversee the approval and review of universities' plans with regards fees.
*'''Transfer of additional powers to the [[Welsh Assembly]]''', including a separate equivalent to OFFA and the right to organise both student support and tuition fees independently.
*'''A new body for dealing with student complaints''' which universities will be legally bound to deal with.
*'''An ''[[Arts and Humanities Research Council]]'' equivalent to existing Science and Technology Councils''', as a replacement for the current [[Arts and Humanities Research Board]].  This is the only aspect of the Act to directly affect [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1698">The '''Higher Scientific Institute for Diocesan Priests at St. Augustine's''' ({{lang-de|Das höheres Weltpriesterbildungsinstitut zum hl. Augustin}}) in [[Vienna]], also well known as '''Augustineum''' or as '''Frintaneum''', was a school for [[diocesan priest]]s that existed between 1816 and 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | pages = 104&amp;ndash;105 | title = Priest and Parish in Vienna: 1780 to 1880 | first = William David | last = Bowman | publisher = BRILL | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780391040946 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CUpXzFad1XoC&amp;pg=PA104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seat of the institution was in the former monastery of Augustinians at Vienna's [[Hofburg]] and after 1914 on Habsburggasse street. The main reason for the establishment of the Institute was the desire of Vienna court to educate own [[priest]]s, independent of [[Rome]].

Pupils of the Institute have studied theology for three years to achieve a doctorate. Pupils wore own special uniform. The Institute was opened for pupils from all over the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. Until 1916, when it was abolished, it was attended by more than 1,000 pupils.

'''Homeschooling''', also known as '''home education''' is the [[education]] of [[children]] at home or a variety of other places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/288135/guidelines_for_las_on_elective_home_educationsecondrevisev2_0.pdf|title=Elective home education—Guidelines for local authorities|location=Section 1.2|page=3|website=gov.uk|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Home education is usually conducted by a parent or tutor or online teacher.&lt;ref&gt;

Before the introduction of [[compulsory education|compulsory school attendance laws]], most childhood education was done by families and local communities.&lt;ref name="EoDL"&gt;A. Distefano, K.&amp;nbsp;E. Rudestam, R.&amp;nbsp;J. Silverman (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=PwNPSlDHFxcC&amp;printsec=frontcover Encyclopedia of Distributed Learning] (p221) {{ISBN|0-7619-2451-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many developed countries, homeschooling is a legal alternative to public and private schools. In other nations, homeschooling remains illegal or restricted to specific conditions, as recorded by [[homeschooling international status and statistics]].

According to the US National Center for Education Statistics, about three percent of all children in the US were homeschooled in 2011-2012 school year. The study found that 83 percent were White, 5 percent were Black, 7 percent were Hispanic, and 2 percent were Asian or Pacific Islander.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=91|title=The NCES Fast Facts Tool provides quick answers to many education questions (National Center for Education Statistics)|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, there are about 1.7 million homeschooled students in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/05/black-homeschooling/560636/|title=The Radical Self-Reliance of Black Homeschooling|last=Anderson|first=Melinda D.|date=2018-05-17|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On average, homeschoolers score at or above the national average on standardized tests. Homeschool students have been accepted into many Ivy League universities.&lt;ref name="EoDL" /&gt;

==History==
{{neutrality section|date=July 2017}}
[[File:Fireside Education frontispiece.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece to ''Fireside Education'', [[Samuel Griswold Goodrich|Samuel Griswold (Goodrich)]]]]

For most of history and in different cultures, the education of children at home by family members was a common practice. Enlisting professional tutors was an option available only to the wealthy. Homeschooling declined in the 19th and 20th centuries with the enactment of compulsory attendance laws. But, it continued to be practiced in isolated communities. Homeschooling began a resurgence in the 1960s and 1970s with educational reformists dissatisfied with industrialized education.&lt;ref name="EoDL" /&gt;

The earliest [[State school|public schools]] in modern [[Western culture]] were established during the [[reformation]] with the encouragement of [[Martin Luther]] in the German states of [[Gotha (district)|Gotha]] and [[Thuringia]] in 1524 and 1527.&lt;ref name="Mises"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/daily/2226#7|title=Education: Free and Compulsory|work=Mises Institute|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the 1500s to 1800s the literacy rate increased until a majority of adults were literate; but, development of the literacy rate occurred before the implementation of compulsory attendance and universal education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/backgrounds/literacy|title=Literacy|last=Houston|first=Robert|date=2011-11-28|website=|access-date=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Home education and apprenticeship continued to remain the main form of education until the 1830s.&lt;ref name="History of Alternative Education"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quaqua.org/utah.htm|title=History of Alternative Education in the United States|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 18th century, the majority of people in Europe lacked formal education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/Encyclopaediabrit08chisrich_201303|title=Encyclopædia Britannica 11 ed. Vol. 8 (Demijohn to Edward the Black Prince)|last=|first=|date=1911|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=959}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- claim not found in source --&gt; Since the early 19th century, formal classroom schooling became the most common means of schooling throughout the developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 1647, New England provided compulsory elementary education. Regional differences in schooling existed in colonial America. In the south, farms and plantations were so widely dispersed that community schools such as those in the more compact settlements of the north were impossible. In the middle colonies, the educational situation varied when comparing New York with New England.&lt;ref name="How they were schooled"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/outlines/history-1963/the-colonial-period/how-they-were-schooled.php|title=How they were schooled|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Native American tribal cultures traditionally used home education and apprenticeship to pass knowledge to children. Parents were supported by extended relatives and tribal leaders in the education of their children. The Native Americans vigorously resisted compulsory education in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sutherlandinstitute.org/uploaded_files/sdmc/lawreview2008witte.pdf|title=Removing Classrooms from the Battle {{!}} SUTHERLAND INSTITUTE|last=|first=|date=2008-07-29|work=SUTHERLAND INSTITUTE|access-date=2017-08-23|page=377,386 Note 30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, [[Rousas John Rushdoony]] began to advocate homeschooling, which he saw as a way to combat the [[secular]] nature of the [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] system in the United States. He vigorously attacked [[progressivism|progressive]] [[school reform]]ers such as [[Horace Mann]] and [[John Dewey]], and argued for the dismantling of the state's influence in education in three works: ''Intellectual Schizophrenia'', ''The Messianic Character of American Education'', and ''The Philosophy of the Christian Curriculum''. Rushdoony was frequently called as an expert witness by the [[Home School Legal Defense Association]] (HSLDA) in court cases. He frequently advocated the use of private schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edgar |first=William |title=The Passing of R. J. Rushdoony |work=First Things |accessdate=2014-04-23 |date=January 2007|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-passing-of-r-j-rushdoony |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404033004/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-passing-of-r-j-rushdoony |archivedate=April 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, American educational professionals Raymond and Dorothy Moore began to research the academic validity of the rapidly growing [[Early Childhood Education]] movement. This research included independent studies by other researchers and a review of over 8,000 studies bearing on early childhood education and the physical and mental development of children.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

They asserted that formal schooling before ages 8–12 not only lacked the anticipated effectiveness, but also harmed children. The Moores published their view that formal schooling was damaging young children academically, socially, mentally, and even physiologically. The Moores presented evidence that childhood problems such as juvenile delinquency, nearsightedness, increased enrollment of students in [[special education]] classes and behavioral problems were the result of increasingly earlier enrollment of students.&lt;ref name="Moore75"&gt;Better Late Than Early, Raymond S. Moore, Dorothy N. Moore, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The Moores cited studies demonstrating that [[orphan]]s who were given [[surrogate mother]]s were measurably more intelligent, with superior long-term effects – even though the mothers were "mentally retarded teenagers" – and that illiterate tribal mothers in Africa produced children who were socially and emotionally more advanced than typical western children, "by western standards of measurement".&lt;ref name="Moore75" /&gt;

Their primary assertion was that the bonds and emotional development made at home with parents during these years produced critical long-term results that were cut short by enrollment in schools, and could neither be replaced nor corrected in an institutional setting afterward.&lt;ref name="Moore75" /&gt; Recognizing a necessity for early out-of-home care for some children, particularly [[special needs]] and impoverished children and children from exceptionally inferior homes{{clarify|reason=What is meant by "exceptionally inferior homes include violent setting, verbal abuse, under educated parents?  Parents with emotional problem, mental handicaps and unable to provide basic care and nutrition.|date=July 2014}}, they maintained that the vast majority of children were far better situated at home, even with mediocre parents, than with the most gifted and motivated teachers in a school setting. They described the difference as follows: "This is like saying, if you can help a child by taking him off the cold street and housing him in a warm tent, then warm tents should be provided for ''all'' children – when obviously most children already have even more secure housing."&lt;ref name="Moore75" /&gt;

Like Holt, the Moores embraced homeschooling after the publication of their first work, ''Better Late Than Early'', in 1975, and became important homeschool advocates and consultants with the publication of books such as ''Home Grown Kids'' (1981), and ''Homeschool Burnout''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Simultaneously, other authors published books questioning the premises and efficacy of compulsory schooling, including ''Deschooling Society'' by [[Ivan Illich]] in 1970 and ''No More Public School'' by Harold Bennet in 1972.

In 1976, Holt published ''Instead of Education; Ways to Help People Do Things Better''. In its conclusion, he called for a "Children's [[Underground Railroad]]" to help children escape compulsory schooling.&lt;ref name="Christine_Field_Patrick"&gt;Christine Field. ''[http://www.thehomeschoolmagazine.com/How_To_Homeschool/articles/articles.php?aid=97 The Old Schoolhouse Meets Up with Patrick Farenga About the Legacy of John Holt]'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816105128/http://www.thehomeschoolmagazine.com/How_To_Homeschool/articles/articles.php?aid=97 |date=August 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Holt was contacted by families from around the U.S. to tell him that they were educating their children at home. In 1977, after corresponding with a number of these families, Holt began producing ''[[Growing Without Schooling]]'', a newsletter dedicated to home education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hsc.org/professionals/briefhistory|title=HSC - A Brief History of Homeschooling|date=2007-12-15|access-date=2017-08-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215100253/http://www.hsc.org/professionals/briefhistory|archivedate=2007-12-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holt was nicknamed the "father of home schooling."&lt;ref name="EoDL" /&gt; Holt later wrote a book about homeschooling, ''Teach Your Own'', in 1981.

In 1980, Holt said, &lt;blockquote&gt;"I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools. I think that the home is the proper base for the exploration of the world which we call learning or education. Home would be the best base no matter how good the schools were."&lt;ref name="kwmzdt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalchild.org/guest/marlene_bumgarner.html|title=A Conversation with John Holt - The Natural Child Project|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;One common theme in the homeschool philosophies of both Holt and that of the Moores is that home education should not attempt to bring the school construct into the home, or a view of education as an academic preliminary to life. They viewed home education as a natural, experiential aspect of life that occurs as the members of the family are involved with one another in daily living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naturalchild.org/guest/marlene_bumgarner.html|title=A Conversation with John Holt - The Natural Child Project|website=www.naturalchild.org|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moorefoundation.com/article/68/about-moore-home-schooling/moore-formula|title=Moore Home Schooling : Moore Formula|last=|first=|date=|website=www.moorefoundation.com|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305142643/http://www.moorefoundation.com/article/68/about-moore-home-schooling/moore-formula|archive-date=2016-03-05|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations==
[[File:Motivations regarded most important for homeschooling.png|thumb|When homeschooling is a choice, families have different reasons for choosing it.|alt=|400x400px]]

Parents commonly cite two main motivations for homeschooling their children: dissatisfaction with the local schools and the interest in increased involvement with their children's learning and development. Parental dissatisfaction with available schools typically includes concerns about the school environment, the quality of academic instruction, the curriculum, bullying, racism and lack of faith in the school's ability to cater to their children's [[special needs]]&lt;ref&gt;https://theconversation.com/record-numbers-of-children-are-now-homeschooled-but-whos-keeping-an-eye-on-the-parents-88449&lt;/ref&gt;. Some parents homeschool in order to have greater control over what and how their children are taught, to cater more adequately to an individual child's aptitudes and abilities, to provide instruction from a specific [[religious]] or [[moral]] position, and to take advantage of the efficiency of one-to-one instruction and thus allow the child to spend more time on childhood activities, socializing, and non-academic learning.  

Some African-American families choose homeschool as a way of increasing their children's understanding of African-American history – such as the [[Jim Crow laws]] that resulted in their ancestors being beaten, killed, or sold for [[learning to read]] – and to limit the harm caused by the unintentional and sometimes subtle [[systemic racism]] that affects most American schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/05/black-homeschooling/560636/|title=The Radical Self-Reliance of Black Homeschooling|last=Anderson|first=Melinda D.|date=2018-05-17|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some parents have objections to the secular nature of public schools and homeschool in order to give their children a religious education. Use of a religious curriculum is common among these families. Recent sociological work suggests that an increasing number of parents are choosing homeschooling because of low academic quality at the local schools, or because of bullying or health problems.&lt;ref name="Reasons Parents Homeschool"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.responsiblehomeschooling.org/homeschooling-101/reasons-parents-homeschool/|title=Reasons Parents Homeschool|date=2013-09-11|website=Coalition for Responsible Home Education|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeschooling may also be a factor in the choice of [[Parenting styles|parenting style]].  Homeschooling can be a matter of consistency for families living in isolated rural locations, for those temporarily abroad, and for those who travel frequently. Many young athletes, actors, and musicians are taught at home to accommodate their training and practice schedules more conveniently. Homeschooling can be about mentorship and apprenticeship, in which a tutor or teacher is with the child for many years and becomes more intimately acquainted with the child.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Homeschooling increased in popularity in the United States during the 2000s; the percentage of children ages 5 through 17 who were homeschooled increased from 1.7% in 1999 to 3% in 2011/12.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Homeschooling can be used a form of supplemental education and as a way of helping children learn under specific circumstances. The term may also refer to instruction in the home under the supervision of [[correspondence school]]s or [[umbrella school]]s.  Some jurisdictions require adherence to an approved [[curriculum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hslda.org/laws/analysis/New_York.pdf |format=PDF|title=Homeschooling in New York: A legal analysis |author=HSLDA |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A curriculum-free philosophy of homeschooling is sometimes called "unschooling", a term coined in 1977 by American educator and author [[John Holt (educator)|John Holt]] in his magazine, ''Growing Without Schooling''. The term emphasizes the more spontaneous, less structured learning environment in which a child's interests drive his pursuit of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Unschooling and Homeschooling FAQ {{!}} Alternative Schooling {{!}} Self Directed Learning|url = http://www.johnholtgws.com/frequently-asked-questions-abo/|website = John Holt GWS|accessdate = 2015-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some parents provide a [[liberal arts]] education using the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]] as the main models.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Teaching methods==

Homeschools use a wide variety of methods and materials. Families choose different educational methods, which represent a variety of educational philosophies and paradigms. Some of the methods or [[learning environment]]s used include [[Classical education movement|Classical education]] (including [[trivium (education)|Trivium]], [[Quadrivium]]), [[Charlotte Mason]] education, [[Montessori method]], [[Theory of multiple intelligences]], Unschooling, Radical Unschooling, [[Waldorf education]], School-at-home (curriculum choices from both secular and religious publishers), [[A Thomas Jefferson Education]], unit studies, curriculum made up from private or small publishers, apprenticeship, hands-on-learning, distance learning (both online and correspondence), dual enrollment in local schools or colleges, and curriculum provided by local schools and many others. Some of these approaches are used in private and public schools.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Educational research and studies support the use of some of these methods.  Unschooling, natural learning, Charlotte Mason Education, Montessori, Waldorf, apprenticeship, hands-on-learning, unit studies are supported to varying degrees by research by [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] learning theories and [[situated cognition]] theories.{{Clarify|reason=Same list as above|date=August 2017}} Elements of these theories may be found in the other methods as well.

A student's education may be customized to support his or her learning level, style, and interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://12most.com/2012/02/07/compelling-reasons-to-homeschool-children/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209130843/http://12most.com/2012/02/07/compelling-reasons-to-homeschool-children/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-02-09 |title=12 Most Compelling Reasons to Homeschool Your Children |publisher=12most.com |date=2012-02-07 |accessdate=2014-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not uncommon for a student to experience more than one approach as the family discovers what works best for their student. Many families use an eclectic approach, picking and choosing from various suppliers. For sources of [[curricula]] and books a study found that 78 percent utilized "a public library"; 77 percent used "a homeschooling catalog, publisher, or individual specialist"; 68 percent used "retail bookstore or another store"; 60 percent used "an education publisher that was not affiliated with homeschooling." "Approximately half" used curriculum from "a homeschooling organization", 37 percent from a "church, synagogue or other religious institution" and 23 percent from "their local public school or district." In 2003, 41 percent utilized some sort of [[distance learning]], approximately 20 percent by "television, video or radio"; 19 percent via "The Internet, e-mail, or the World Wide Web"; and 15 percent taking a "correspondence course by mail designed specifically for homeschoolers."&lt;ref name="NCES"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2006/homeschool/index.asp|title=Homeschooling in the United States: 2003 - Executive Summary|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=difficult to read list of statistics|date=August 2017}}

Individual governmental units, e.g. states and local districts, vary in official curriculum and attendance requirements.&lt;ref name="HSLDA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hslda.org/hs/state/default.asp|title=HSLDA - Home Schooling-State|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Informal Learning ===
As a subset of homeschooling, informal learning happens outside of the classroom, but has no traditional boundaries of education. Informal learning is an everyday form of learning through participation and creation, in contrast with the traditional view of teacher-centered learning. The term is often combined with non-formal learning, and self-directed learning. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|title=Informal learning|date=2018-10-27|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Informal_learning&amp;oldid=865913107|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informal learning differs from traditional learning since there are no expected objectives or outcomes. From the learner’s standpoint, the knowledge that they receive is not intentional.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Anything from planting a garden to baking a cake or even talking to a technician at work about the installation of new software, can be considered informal learning. The individual is completing a task with different intentions, but ends up learning skills in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.unh.edu/stable/42979596|title=User Verification {{!}} University of New Hampshire Library|website=www-jstor-org.libproxy.unh.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children watching their tomato plants grow will not generate questions about photosynthesis but they will learn that their plants are growing with water and sunlight. This leads them to have a base understanding of complex scientific concepts without any background studying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.unh.edu/stable/42731048?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|title=User Verification {{!}} University of New Hampshire Library|website=www-jstor-org.libproxy.unh.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recent trend of homeschooling becoming less stigmatized has been in connection with the traditional waning of the idea that the state needs to be in primary and ultimate control over the education and upbringing of all children to create future adult citizens &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com.libproxy.unh.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=psyh&amp;AN=2013-23496-008&amp;site=ehost-live|title=User Verification {{!}} University of New Hampshire Library|website=search.ebscohost.com.libproxy.unh.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This breeds an ever growing importance on the ideas and concepts that children learn outside of the traditional classroom setting, including Informal learning.

Depending on the part of the world, informal learning can take on many different identities and has differing cultural importances. Many ways of organizing homeschooling draw on apprenticeship qualities and on non-western cultures. In [[Homeschooling international status and statistics|South American indigenous culture]], children learn irrigation and farming technique through play, advancing them not only in their own village and society, but also in their knowledge of realistic techniques that they will need to survive &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolin|first=Inge|date=November 2006|title=Growing up in a Culture of Respect: Child Rearing in Highland Peru|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/jlca.2006.11.2.430|journal=Journal of Latin American Anthropology|volume=11|issue=2|pages=430–432|doi=10.1525/jlca.2006.11.2.430|issn=1085-7052}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In Western culture, children use informal learning in two main ways. The first as talked about, is through hands-on experience with new material. The second is asking questions to someone who has more experience than they have (i.e. parents, elders). Childrens inquisitive nature is their way of cementing the ideas they have learned through exposure informal learning. It is a more casual way of learning than traditional learning and serves the purpose of taking in information any which way they can.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Legare|first=Cristine H.|last2=Sobel|first2=David M.|last3=Callanan|first3=Maureen|date=October 2017|title=Causal learning is collaborative: Examining explanation and exploration in social contexts|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28744768|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=24|issue=5|pages=1548–1554|doi=10.3758/s13423-017-1351-3|issn=1531-5320|pmid=28744768}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Structured versus unstructured ===
All other approaches to homeschooling are subsumed under two basic categories: structured and unstructured homeschooling. Structured homeschooling includes any method or style of home education that follows a basic curriculum with articulated goals and outcomes. This style attempts to imitate the structure of the traditional school setting while personalizing the curriculum. Unstructured homeschooling is any form of home education where parents do not construct a curriculum at all. Unschooling, as it is known, attempts to teach through the child's daily experiences and focuses more on self-directed learning by the child, free of textbooks, teachers, and any formal assessment of success or failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin-Chang|first1= S.|last2= Gould|first2= O. N.|last3= &amp; Meuse|first3= R. E. |year=2011|title= The impact of schooling on academic achievement: Evidence from homeschooled and traditionally schooled students|work=[[Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science]]|volume= 43 (3)|page= 195-202|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/878227015|via=proquest.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unit studies===
In a unit study approach, multiple subjects such as math, science, history, art, and geography, are studied in relation to a single topic. Unit studies are useful for teaching multiple grades simultaneously as the difficulty level can be adjusted for each student. An extended form of unit studies, Integrated Thematic Instruction utilizes one central theme integrated throughout the curriculum so that students finish a school year with a deep understanding of a certain broad subject or idea.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===All-in-one curricula===
All-in-one homeschooling curricula (variously known as "school-at-home", "the traditional approach", "school-in-a-box" or "The Structured Approach"), are instructionist methods of teaching in which the curriculum and homework of the student are similar or identical to those used in a public or private school. Purchased as a grade level package or separately by subject, the package may contain all of the needed books, materials, tests, answer keys, and extensive teacher guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.homeschool.com/Approaches/SchoolAtHome.asp|title=Homeschooling Approaches - School-at-Home|last=|first=|date=|website=www.homeschool.com|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These materials cover the same subject areas as public schools, allowing for an easy transition into the school system. These are among the more expensive options for homeschooling, but they require minimal preparation and are easy to use. Some localities provide the same materials used at local schools to homeschoolers. The purchase of a complete curriculum and their teaching/grading service from an accredited distance learning curriculum provider may allow students to obtain an accredited high school diploma.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Unschooling and natural learning===

"Natural learning" refers to a type of learning-on-demand where children pursue knowledge based on their interests and parents take an active part in facilitating activities and experiences conducive to learning but do not rely heavily on textbooks or spend much time "teaching", looking instead for "learning moments" throughout their daily activities. Parents see their role as that of affirming through positive feedback and modeling the necessary skills, and the child's role as being responsible for asking and learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-80 |title=Self-Directed Education—Unschooling and Democratic Schooling|work=[[Oxford University Press]]|first=Peter|last=Gray|date=April 15, 2017|accessdate=September 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[unschooling]]" as coined by [[John Holt (educator)|John Holt]] describes an approach in which parents do not authoritatively direct the child's education, but interact with the child following the child's own interests, leaving them free to explore and learn as their interests lead.&lt;ref name=kwmzdt/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCES/&gt; "Unschooling" does not indicate that the child is not being educated, but that the child is not being "schooled", or educated in a rigid school-type manner. Holt asserted that children learn through the experiences of life, and he encouraged parents to live their lives with their child. Also known as interest-led or child-led learning, unschooling attempts to follow opportunities as they arise in real life, through which a child will learn without coercion. Children at school learn from 1 teacher and 2 auxiliary teachers in a classroom of approximately 30. Kids have the opportunity of dedicated education at home with a ratio of 1 to 1. An unschooled child may utilize texts or classroom instruction, but these are not considered central to education. Holt asserted that there is no specific body of knowledge that is, or should be, required of a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.braingamesfortots.com/Articles/Why-is-education-important-homeschooling-and-the-Montessori-method.aspx|title=Why is education important, homeschooling and the Montessori method|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both unschooling and natural learning advocates believe that children learn best by doing; a child may learn reading to further an interest about history or other cultures, or math skills by operating a small business or sharing in family finances. They may learn animal husbandry keeping dairy goats or meat rabbits, botany tending a kitchen garden, chemistry to understand the operation of firearms or the internal combustion engine, or politics and local history by following a zoning or historical-status dispute. While any type of homeschoolers may also use these methods, the unschooled child initiates these learning activities. The natural learner participates with parents and others in learning together.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Another prominent proponent of unschooling is [[John Taylor Gatto]], author of [[Dumbing Us Down]], The Exhausted School, A Different Kind of Teacher, and [[Weapons of Mass Instruction]]. Gatto argues that public education is the primary tool of "state controlled consciousness" and serves as a prime illustration of the [[total institution]] — a social system which impels obedience to the state and quells free thinking or dissent.&lt;ref&gt;John Taylor Gatto, ''Weapons of Mass Instruction'' (Odysseus Group, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autonomous learning===
Autonomous learning is a school of [[education]] which sees learners as individuals who can and should be [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] i.e. be responsible for their own learning climate.

Autonomous education helps students develop their self-consciousness, vision, practicality and freedom of discussion. These attributes serve to aid the student in his/her independent learning. However, a student must not start their autonomous learning completely on their own. It is said, that by first having interaction with someone who has more knowledge in a subject, will speed up the student's learning, and hence allow them to learn more independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L. W. Chiu|first=Hazel|year=2012|title=Supporting the development of autonomous learning skills in reading and writing in an independent language learning centre.|url=https://sisaljournal.org/archives/sep12/chiu/?like=1&amp;source=post_flair&amp;_wpnonce=f5309b4960|journal=Studies in Self-Access Learning Journal|volume=3|pages=271–272|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some degree of autonomous learning is popular with those who home educate their children. In true autonomous learning, the child usually gets to decide what projects they wish to tackle or what interests to pursue. In home education, this can be instead of or in addition to regular subjects like doing math or English.

According to Home Education UK the autonomous education philosophy emerged from the [[epistemology]] of [[Karl Popper]] in ''The Myth of the Framework: In Defence of Science and Rationality'', which is developed in the [[Karl Popper debate#Karl Popper debate|debate]]s, which seek to rebut the neo-Marxist social philosophy of convergence proposed by the [[Frankfurt School]]  (e.g. [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Max Horkheimer]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Homeschool cooperatives==

A homeschool cooperative is a [[cooperative]] of families who homeschool their children. It provides an opportunity for children to learn from other parents who are more specialized in certain areas or subjects. Co-ops also provide social interaction. They may take lessons together or go on field trips. Some co-ops also offer events such as prom and graduation for homeschoolers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://californiahomeschool.net/howTo/highSchool.htm|title=CHN - Homeschool FAQ|website=californiahomeschool.net|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeschoolers are beginning to utilize [[Web 2.0]] as a way to simulate homeschool cooperatives online. With [[social networks]] homeschoolers can chat, discuss threads in forums, share information and tips, and even participate in online classes via blackboard systems similar to those used by colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nheri.org/homeschool-technology-and-online-communication/|title=Homeschool Technology and Online Communication - National Home Education Research Institute|work=National Home Education Research Institute|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test results===
According to the [[Home School Legal Defense Association]] (HSLDA) in 2004, "Many studies over the last few years have established the academic excellence of homeschooled children."&lt;ref name="hslda.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hslda.org/docs/nche/000010/200410250.asp|title=HSLDA - Academic Statistics on Homeschooling|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homeschooling Achievement—a compilation of studies published by the HSLDA—supported the [[academic integrity]] of homeschooling. This booklet summarized a 1997 study by Ray and the 1999 Rudner study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academic Achievement|url=http://www.hslda.org/docs/study/comp2001/default.asp| publisher=HSLDA|accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rudner study noted two limitations of its own research: it is not necessarily representative of all homeschoolers and it is not a comparison with other schooling methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Achievement and Demographics of Home School Students|url=http://epaa.asu.edu/ojs/article/view/543/666|publisher=Education Policy Analysis Archives|accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the homeschooled students who took the tests, the average homeschooled student outperformed his public school peers by 30 to 37 percentile points across all subjects. The study also indicates that public school performance gaps between minorities and genders were virtually non-existent among the homeschooled students who took the tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hslda.org/docs/study/comp2001/default.asp|title=HSLDA - Home Schooling Achievement|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted in 2008 found that 11,739 homeschooled students, on average, scored 37 percentile points above public school students on standardized achievement tests.&lt;ref name=Ray&gt;{{cite web|last=Ray|first=Brian|title=Progress Report 2009: Homeschool Academic Achievement and Demographics|url=http://www.hslda.org/docs/media/2009/200908100.asp|work=Survey|publisher=National Home Education Research Institute|accessdate=6 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105090830/http://www.hslda.org/docs/media/2009/200908100.asp#|archive-date=2013-01-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the 1999 Rudner study. However, Rudner said that these same students in public school may have scored just as well because of the dedicated parents they had.&lt;ref name="Rudner Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Welner|first=Kariane Mari|author2=Kevin G.

(2010). Academic achievement and demographic traits of homeschool students: a nationwide study. ''Academic Leadership Live: The Online Journal'', 8(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a quasi-experimental study was conducted that included homeschooled and traditional public students between the ages of 5 and 10. It was discovered that the majority of the homeschooled children achieved higher standardized scores compared to their counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;1. Chang- Martin, S., Gould, O., &amp; Meuse, R. (2011). The impact of schooling on academic achievement: evidence from homeschooled and traditionally schooled students. ''Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science'', 43(3): 195-202. doi:10.1037/a0022697
&lt;/ref&gt; However, Martin-Chang also found that unschooling children ages 5–10 scored significantly below traditionally educated children, while academically oriented homeschooled children scored from one half grade level above to 4.5 grade levels above traditionally schooled children on standardized tests (n=37 home schooled children matched with children from the same socioeconomic and educational background).&lt;ref name=Martin-Chang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin-Chang|first=Sandra|author2=Gould, O.N. |author3=Meuse, R.E. |title=The impact of schooling on academic achievement: Evidence from home-schooled and traditionally-schooled students|journal=Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science|year=2011|volume=43|issue=3|pages=195–202 |doi=10.1037/a0022697|url=http://crdh.concordia.ca/researchers/Sandra_Martin-Chang.html|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have also examined the impact of homeschooling on students' [[GPA]]s. Cogan (2010) found that homeschooled students had higher high school GPAs (3.74) and transfer GPAs (3.65) than conventional students.&lt;ref&gt;Cogan, F. (2010). Exploring academic outcomes of homeschooled students. ''Journal of College Admission'', 208, 18-25&lt;/ref&gt; Snyder (2013) provided corroborating evidence that homeschoolers were outperforming their peers in the areas of standardized tests and overall GPAs.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Marc. (2013). An evaluative study of the academic achievement of homeschooled students versus traditionally schooled students attending a catholic university. ''Catholic Education: A Journal of Inquiry and Practice March'', 16, 288-308&lt;/ref&gt; Looking beyond high school, a study by the 1990 National Home Education Research Institute (as cited by Wichers, 2001) found that at least 33% of home schooled students attended a four-year college, and 17% attended a two-year college.  This same study examined the students after one year, finding that that 17% pursued higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Wichers, M. (2001). Homeschooling: adventitious or detrimental for proficiency in higher education. ''Education'', 122, 145-150&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the data indicates that homeschooling can also prepare students for success in higher education.{{Original research inline|date=August 2017}}

===Outcomes===

Homeschooled children may receive more individualized attention than students enrolled in traditional public schools. A 2011 study suggests that a structured environment could play a key role in homeschooler academic achievement.&lt;ref name="Chang- Martin 2011"&gt;Chang- Martin, S., Gould, O., &amp; Meuse, R.  (2011). The impact of schooling on academic achievement: evidence from homeschooled and traditionally schooled students. ''Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science'', 43(3): 195-202. doi:10.1037/a0022697&lt;/ref&gt; This means that parents were highly involved in their child's education and they were creating clear educational goals. In addition, these students were being offered organized lesson plans which are either self-made or purchased.&lt;ref name="Chang- Martin 2011"/&gt;

A study conducted by Ray (2010), indicates that the higher the level of parents' income, the more likely the homeschooled child is able to achieve academic success.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Brian. (2010). Academic achievement and demographic traits of homeschool students: a nationwide study. ''Academic Leadership Live: The Online Journal'', 8(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, Raymond and Dorothy Moore conducted four federally funded analyses of more than 8,000 early childhood studies, from which they published their original findings in ''Better Late Than Early'', 1975. This was followed by ''School Can Wait'', a repackaging of these same findings designed specifically for educational professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Better Late Than Early, Raymond S. Moore, Dorothy N. Moore, Seventh Printing, 1993, addendum&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that, "where possible, children should be withheld from formal schooling until at least ages eight to ten." Their reason was that children "are not mature enough for formal school programs until their senses, coordination, neurological development and cognition are ready". They concluded that the outcome of forcing children into formal schooling is a sequence of "1) uncertainty as the child leaves the family nest early for a less secure environment, 2) puzzlement at the new pressures and restrictions of the classroom, 3) frustration because unready learning tools – senses, cognition, brain hemispheres, coordination – cannot handle the regimentation of formal lessons and the pressures they bring, 4) hyperactivity growing out of nerves and jitter, from frustration, 5)  failure which quite naturally flows from the four experiences above, and 6) delinquency which is failure's twin and apparently for the same reason."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moorefoundation.com/article.php?id=53|title=Moore Foundation : When Education Becomes Abuse|date=2009-03-31|access-date=2017-08-23|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331150759/http://www.moorefoundation.com/article.php?id=53|archivedate=2009-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Moores, "early formal schooling is burning out our children. Teachers who attempt to cope with these youngsters also are burning out." Aside from academic performance, they think early formal schooling also destroys "positive sociability", encourages peer dependence, and discourages self-worth, optimism, respect for parents, and trust in peers. They believe this situation is particularly acute for boys because of their delay in maturity. The Moores cited a Smithsonian Report on the development of genius, indicating a requirement for "1) much time spent with warm, responsive parents and other adults, 2) very little time spent with peers, and 3) a great deal of free exploration under parental guidance." Their analysis suggested that children need "more of home and less of formal school", "more free exploration with... parents, and fewer limits of classroom and books", and "more old fashioned chores – children working with parents – and less attention to rivalry sports and amusements."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Along with positive school outcomes, homeschooled youth are also less likely to use and abuse illicit substances and are more likely to disapprove of using alcohol and marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vaughn|first=Michael G.|last2=Salas-Wright|first2=Christopher P.|last3=Kremer|first3=Kristen P.|last4=Maynard|first4=Brandy R.|last5=Roberts|first5=Greg|last6=Vaughn|first6=Sharon|title=Are homeschooled adolescents less likely to use alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0376871615016014|journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence|volume=155|pages=97–104|doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.08.010|pmc=4652803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Debate about outcomes ====
There are claims that studies showing that homeschooled students do better on standardized tests&lt;ref name="hslda.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ray" /&gt; do not compare with mandatory public-school testing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

By contrast, SAT and ACT tests are self-selected by homeschooled and formally schooled students alike. Some homeschoolers averaged higher scores on these college entrance tests in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Homeschool Legal Defense Association. "Academic Statistics on Homeschooling." [http://www.hslda.org/docs/nche/000010/200410250.asp Hslda.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Other scores (1999 data) showed mixed results, for example showing higher levels for homeschoolers in English (homeschooled 23.4 vs national average 20.5) and reading (homeschooled 24.4 vs national average 21.4) on the ACT, but mixed scores in math (homeschooled 20.4 vs national average 20.7 on the ACT as opposed homeschooled 535 vs national average 511 on the 1999 SAT math).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oakmeadow.com/resources/articles/WSJArticle.htm|title=Home-Schooled Kids Defy Stereotypes, Ace SAT Test|date=11 February 2000|work=The Wall Street Journal|author=Daniel Golden|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118013315/http://www.oakmeadow.com/resources/articles/WSJArticle.htm|archivedate=January 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some advocates of homeschooling and educational choice counter with an input-output theory, pointing out that home educators expend only an average of $500–$600 a year on each student (not counting the cost of the parents' time), in comparison to $9,000-$10,000 (including the cost of staff time) for each public school student in the United States, which suggests home-educated students would be especially dominant on tests if afforded access to an equal commitment of tax-funded educational resources.&lt;ref name="sutherlandinstitute.org"&gt;[http://sutherlandinstitute.org/uploads/Choice-based_Educational_Innovation.pdf "Fostering Educational Innovation in Choice-Based Multi-Venue and Government Single-Venue Settings."] (pp. 32 n.21; 35-36 n.27; 42 n.57; 44 n.66) {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many teachers and school districts oppose the idea of homeschooling. However, research has shown that homeschooled children often excel in many areas of academic endeavor. According to a study done on the homeschool movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stevens|first=Mitchell L.|title=Kingdom of Children: Culture and Controversy in the Homeschooling Movement|date=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691114682|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7135.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; homeschoolers often achieve academic success and admission into elite universities. There is also evidence that most are remarkably well socialized. According to the National Home Education Research Institute president, Brian Ray, socialization is not a problem for homeschooling children, many of whom are involved in community sports, volunteer activities, book groups, or homeschool co-ops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sizer|first=Bridget Bentz|title=Socialization: Tackling Homeschooling's "S" word|journal=Pbsparents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socialization===

Using the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale, John Taylor later found that, "while half of the conventionally schooled children scored at or below the 50th percentile (in [[self-concept]]), only 10.3% of the home-schooling children did so."&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;Self-Concept in home-schooling children, John Wesley Taylor V, Ph.D., Andrews University, Berrien Springs, MI&lt;/ref&gt; He further stated that "the self-concept of home-schooling children is significantly higher statistically than that of children attending conventional school. This has implications in the areas of academic achievement and socialization which have been found to parallel self-concept. Regarding socialization, Taylor's results would mean that very few home-schooling children are socially deprived. He states that critics who speak out against homeschooling on the basis of social deprivation are actually addressing an area which favors homeschoolers.&lt;ref name="taylor"/&gt;

In 2003, the National Home Education Research Institute conducted a survey of 7,300 U.S. adults who had been homeschooled (5,000 for more than seven years). Their findings included:

:*Homeschool graduates are active and involved in their communities. 71% participate in an ongoing community service activity, like coaching a sports team, volunteering at a school, or working with a church or neighborhood association, compared with 37% of U.S. adults of similar ages from a traditional education background.
:*Homeschool graduates are more involved in civic affairs and vote in much higher percentages than their peers. 76% of those surveyed between the ages of 18 and 24 voted within the last five years, compared with only 29% of the corresponding U.S. populace. The numbers are even greater in older age groups, with voting levels not falling below 95%, compared with a high of 53% for the corresponding U.S. populace.
:*58.9% report that they are "very happy" with life, compared with 27.6% for the general U.S. population. 73.2% find life "exciting", compared with 47.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hslda.org/research/ray2003/|title=HSLDA - Homeschooling Grows Up|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International status and statistics==
{{Main article|Homeschooling international status and statistics}}

Homeschooling is [[Legality of homeschooling|legal]] in some countries. Countries with the most prevalent home education movements include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Chile and the United States. Some countries have highly regulated home education programs as an extension of the compulsory school system; others, such as Sweden, Germany&lt;ref name=Spiegler&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Spiegler |first=Thomas |title=Home education in Germany: An overview of the contemporary situation |url=http://www.multilingual-matters.net/erie/017/0179/erie0170179.pdf |journal=Evaluation and Research in Education |year=2003 |volume=17 |pages=179–90 |format=PDF |doi=10.1080/09500790308668301 |issue=2–3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910031847/http://www.multilingual-matters.net/erie/017/0179/erie0170179.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jul/18/home-school-ban-in-sweden-forces-families-to-mull-/ |title=Home-school ban in Sweden forces families to mull leaving |publisher=The Washington Times |date=July 18, 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most European countries have outlawed it entirely.

===Australia===
{{One source|section|date=April 2017}}
{{Advert|section|date=April 2017}}
Home education or homeschooling, in Australia is much the same as elsewhere. Some reasons as to why people choose to homeschool is because it's a lifestyle choice, some people choose to home educate so that they can travel and spend quality time with their kids.&lt;ref name="FAQ's"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hea.edu.au/homeschooling-get-started!/faqs/|title=FAQ's|website=www.hea.edu.au|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some children learn differently to the general crowd and can get bored or can struggle at school, where the teachers are unable to cater for the individuality of each child.

Homeschooling requires government registration, with different requirements from state to state. Some home educators prefer to be regulated, but others question whether the government has any legitimate authority to oversee the choices parents make to raise and educate their children.&lt;ref name="FAQ's"/&gt; Curricular help is offered by the Australian Government.

Many organisations exist to help parents and teachers with home education. The HEA (Home Education Association) is one support organisation, having grown through local support networks. The HEA does not produce educational material, but offers support to families choosing to homeschool.&lt;ref name="FAQ's"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=April 2017}}

===Brazil===
Homeschooling in [[South America]] has not taken hold as it has in North American countries of Canada and the United States.  In 1824, [[Brazil]] permitted home education to take the place of traditional education for nearly 70 years.  In 1990, however, The Statute of Children and Adolescents, or the Estatuto da Criança e Adolescente, prohibited homeschooling and did not recognize it as a legitimate form of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thebrazilbusiness.com/article/homeschooling-in-brazil|title=Homeschooling in Brazil|newspaper=The Brazil Business|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A resurgence in the homeschooling movement, however, has encouraged congressman Lincoln Portela to introduce a new bill that would allow children to be educated at home if parents followed state approved guidelines.  The National Association of Home Education was founded in 2010 to achieve these goals. Rough estimates state that around 3,201 families are homeschooling in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/educacao/educacao-domiciliar-ganha-forca-no-brasil-e-busca-legalizacao-7wvulatmkslazdhwncstr7tco|title=Educação domiciliar ganha força no Brasil e busca legalização|newspaper=Gazeta do Povo|language=pt-BR|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Homeschooling is legal in all provinces and territories in Canada and has been for 40 years.  The Ontario Education Act, for example, states in Section 21(2)(a) that "A person is excused from attendance at school if [...] the person is receiving education elsewhere".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90e02#BK27|title=Law Document English View|date=2014-07-24|newspaper=Ontario.ca|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Canada is known as having some of the most comprehensive legal protections for homeschooling parents in the Americas.  Some provinces have implemented policies that require parents to notify school boards of their decision to homeschool.  Every province requires parents to notify the school system of their intent to withdraw their child from the public school system and to begin home education.  Five of ten provinces additionally require parents to submit a detailed curriculum to the state.  Seven of these provinces do not require the program to be monitored by the school board or other private school administrators, and only five provinces require routine inspection of home education.&lt;ref name="Deani Neven Van Pelt 2015"&gt;Deani Neven Van Pelt (2015). Home Schooling in Canada: The Current Picture—2015 Edition. Barbara Mitchell Centre for Improvement in Education. Fraser Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; These policies, however, are not law; although Canadian legislators recognize the importance of state controls in the homeschooling environment, it is ultimately up to the parent to decide when and how to homeschool.  Despite a positive environment that supports and encourages alternatives to traditional schooling, it is estimated that less than 0.5% of Canadian families were homeschooling in 2015.  This number is probably inaccurate, however, as many parents do not report their decisions to homeschool.&lt;ref name="Deani Neven Van Pelt 2015"/&gt;

Unlike the United States, where homeschooling is largely a consequence of religious conviction, a study of 1,600 families in 2003 found that Canadians primarily choose to homeschool out of a desire to provide better education.  For those children whose parents decided to homeschool out of a desire to better education, a 2003 study found statistical significance between traditionally schooled and homeschooled students scores on standardized tests of writing, reading, and mathematics. A more recent 2011 study found that style of home education (structured versus unstructured) was a more important predictor of standardized test performance than other traditional measures, such as income and parents' educational attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flora.org/homeschool-ca/faq.html#journalists|title=Canadian Home Based Learning Resource Page|website=www.flora.org|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These findings are similar to findings in U.S. research on homeschooled children and the outcomes of homeschooling.

One technique that is specifically Canadian, specifically British Columbian, is the [[Distributed learning|Distributed Learning]] approach to home education.  Distributed Learning is an online program that is directed by a teacher that meets provincial standards for education.  The program draws on public and private curricula. This is distinctive to British Columbia because it is the only province that has Distributed Learning policy.  It is one of the most popular forms of home education.&lt;ref name="Deani Neven Van Pelt 2015"/&gt;

===Israel===
Homeschooling is legal in Israel, and requires acquiring a permission from the Ministry of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelhomeschool.org/faq.htm|title=Israel Home Education—FAQ|date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The permission involves a home visit from the person in charge of handing out the permissions, and writing a letter describing the motives, curriculum, daily routine and socialization of the children. Unschooling is legal, and the requirements are minimal. The reasons for homeschooling in Israel are very similar to those of the rest of the world, with the exception of religious motives, since religious schools are prevalent.
There is unclear information regarding the number of Homeschooling families, since not all families ask for permission, and many homeschool their children without enlisting. Estimates range between 500-1000 families.

=== Germany ===
Up until 1920, homeschooling in [[Germany]] was seen as an acceptable practice under certain circumstances.  With the rise of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]], homeschooling was seen as an anti-nationalistic and subversive practice that could undermine children's loyalty to their country.  The Reichsschulpflichtgesetz, implemented in 1938, effectively banned all homeschooling with criminal consequences for anyone found practicing. Homeschooling wouldn't become a public concept until the 1980s.  In 1989, Helmut Stücher removed his children from the public school system to begin home schooling.  Stücher and others who followed suit were fined, and some even lost child custody.&lt;ref&gt;J.D., 2010. HOMESCHOOLING IN GERMANY AND THE UNITED STATES. James E. Rogers College of Law The Catholic University of America. Arizona Journal of International and Comparative Law.&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until the unification of Germany in 1990 that education law was reformed and homeschooling was allowed under strict observation and extreme circumstances. Today, however, homeschooling remains illegal.

Germany has not endorsed homeschooling as other countries have. Its neighbors, Switzerland and Austria, have embraced the notion and are following similar paths as the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="german-way.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.german-way.com/homeschooling-verboten/|title=Homeschooling verboten|last=|first=|date=|website=www.german-way.com|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
{{Main|Homeschooling in South Africa}}
Home education was outlawed in South Africa before 1994, and families were jailed for not sending their children to school. With the acceptance of the South African constitution in 1994, home education was legalised per implication. This was acknowledged with promulgation of the SA Schools Act of 1996 in which home education is accommodated in art. 51. Since home education was legalised, it has grown exponentially. According to the census count of 2011, there were about 57 000 home learners in the country, putting South Africa in the top five countries in terms of number of home learners.

'''Instructure, Inc.''' is an educational technology company based in [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]. It is the developer of the Canvas [[learning management system]], which is a comprehensive cloud-native software package that competes with such systems as [[Blackboard Learning System]], [[Moodle]], [[D2L]] and [[Sakai Project]]. Instructure also developed Canvas Network,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canvas.net Canvas Network]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[MOOC|massive open online course]] (MOOC) platform.

==History==
Instructure was founded in 2008 by two [[BYU]] graduate students, Brian Whitmer and Devlin Daley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BYU grads introduce education-savvy software|author=Sara Israelsen-Hartley|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700040784/BYU-grads-introduce-education-savvy-software.html|newspaper=Deseret News|date=June 20, 2010|accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with initial funding from [[Mozy]] founder Josh Coates (currently the CEO) and Epic Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/company/instructure|title=Instructure CrunchBase Profile|work=CrunchBase|publisher=Interserve dba TechCrunch|accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, the [[Utah Education Network]] (UEN), which represents a number of Utah colleges and universities, announced that Instructure would be replacing Blackboard as their preferred [[Learning management system|LMS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uen.org/news/article.php?id=190|title=New Statewide Learning Management System Selected|work=UEN News|publisher=Utah Education Network|date=December 14, 2010|accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January, 2013, Instructure's LMS platform was in use by more than 300 colleges, universities and K-12 districts, and the company's customer base had increased to more than 425 halfway through 2013 and 9 million users by the end of 2013.&lt;ref name=tc&gt;{{cite web|last=Empson|first=Rip|title=With 4.5M Users, Instructure Takes On The Courseras &amp; Udacities Of The World With Its Own Open Course Network|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/31/instructure-canvas-network/|publisher=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capterra.com/infographics/top-lms-software&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, Instructure announced that they were making their flagship product, Canvas, freely available under an [[Affero General Public License|AGPL]] license as [[open source software]]. Instructure's announcement received coverage in the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2011/02/02/a-fiery-new-competitor.aspx|title=A Fiery New Competitor|author=Dan Dzombak|date=February 2, 2011|work=The Motley Fool|publisher=The Motley Fool, LLC|accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/31/instructure-blackboard-universities-coates/|title=Instructure Launches To Root Blackboard Out Of Universities|author=Michael Arrington|date=January 31, 2011|work=TechCrunch.com|publisher=Interserve dba TechCrunch|accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/upstart-course-management-provider-goes-open-source/29391|title=Upstart Course-Management Provider Goes Open Source|author=Josh Keller|date=January 31, 2011|work=Wired Campus|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/education/there-are-alternatives-to-blackboard-and-moodle-instructure-canvas-goes-open-source/4475|title=There are alternatives to Blackboard and Moodle: Instructure Canvas goes open source|author=Christopher Dawson|date=February 1, 2011|work=ZDNet Education|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2012, the company launched Canvas K-12.&lt;ref&gt;Canvas K-12: http://www.instructure.com/k-12&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, Instructure entered the [[massive open online course]] market by launching Canvas Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/31/instructure-canvas-network/|title=With 4.5M Users, Instructure Takes On The Courseras &amp; Udacities Of The World With Its Own Open Course Network - TechCrunch|date=October 31, 2012|work=TechCrunch|publisher=techcrunch.com.com|author=Rip Empson|accessdate=September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Instructure secured $30 Million in Series D Funding, bringing their lifetime funding total to $50M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/instructure-secures-30-million-in-series-d-funding-2013-06-05|title=Instructure Secures $30 Million in Series D Funding - MarketWatch|date=June 5, 2013|work=Market Watch|publisher=marketwatch.com|accessdate=September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February, 2015, Instructure raised another $40 Million in Series E Funding, raising their lifetime funding total to $90M.

===Canvas===
Instructure Inc. was created in order to support the continued development of a new learning management system ([[Learning management system|LMS]]) originally named Instructure.  Once incorporated, the founders changed the name of the software to Canvas.  The Utah-based company tested the LMS at several local schools including [[Utah State University]] and [[Brigham Young University]] before officially launching Canvas. Canvas is now used by more than 3,000 universities, school districts, and institutions around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=https://www.canvaslms.com/about-us/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canvas was built using [[Ruby on Rails]] as the web application framework backed by a [[PostgreSQL]] database.  It incorporates [[JQuery]], [[HTML5]], and [[CSS3]] to provide a modern user interface.  [[OAuth]] is used to provide limited access to a user's information on certain social media sites like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] to allow for collaboration between sites.  Canvas operates as a [[software as a service]] using [[Amazon Web Services]] in the "Cloud".

In 2011, Canvas launched their iOS app, and in 2013, their Android app, enabling mobile access to the Canvas learning platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Instructure Releases Canvas for Android|url=https://www.canvaslms.com/news/press-releases/instructure-releases-canvas-for-android|website=canvaslms|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apps were eventually split into Canvas Student and Canvas Teacher, separating features for students and instructors. In 2016, Canvas launched Canvas Parent, their mobile app for parents, for both iOS and Android, allowing parents of K–12 students stay informed on their children's assignments, grades and overall schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canvas Announces New, First-of-its-kind Mobile App for Parents|url=https://www.canvaslms.com/news/pr/canvas-announces-new-first-of-its-kind-mobile-app-for-parents&amp;122616|website=canvaslms|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canvas K-12===
In February 2012, Instructure launched Canvas [[K-12]], an LMS platform designed for the specific needs of elementary and secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Box spins Embed, OneCloud for educational use at K-12 schools, universities|url=http://www.zdnet.com/box-spins-embed-onecloud-for-educational-use-at-k-12-schools-universities-7000019163/|publisher=ZDNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LMS enrolls parents with their students to provide greater visibility into their children's learning experience and provides actionable analytics to teachers and administrators.

===Canvas Network===
In November 2012, Instructure entered the [[Massive open online course|massive open online course MOOC]] market by launching Canvas Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nagel|first=David|title=Instructure Creates Free 'Canvas Network' for Online Courses|url=http://campustechnology.com/articles/2012/11/01/instructure-creates-free-canvas-network-for-online-courses.aspx|publisher=Campus Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instructure's approach to MOOC has been to facilitate experimentation with pedagogy and new ways to use multimedia environments to change cognition and enhance the learning process. One example is "[[Gender Through Comic Books]]," a [[MOOC]] taught by [[Ball State University]]'s Christina Blanch on Canvas Network that used lessons from pop culture to explore evolving social norms and other anthropological ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knox|first=Kelly|title=New Online Course Explores Gender Through Comic Books|url=https://www.wired.com/geekmom/2013/01/gender-through-comics/|publisher=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Instructure partnered with [[Qualtrics]], a Utah-based company, to survey MOOC participants on Instructure's Canvas Network about their motivations for enrolling in and completing these courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=F. Carr|first=David|title=MOOC Students Attracted Most By Course Topics|url=http://www.informationweek.com/software/mooc-students-attracted-most-by-course-topics/d/d-id/1110976|publisher=Information Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results suggested that educators rethink ways to fully leverage the online learning environment to make the educational experience more engaging and interesting.

===Bridge===
On February 18, 2015, Instructure officially launched Bridge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/18/on-the-way-to-an-ipo-education-technology-startup-instructure-is-close-to-raising-a-big-new-round/ | title=On The Way To An IPO, Education Technology Startup Instructure Is Close To Raising A Big New Round | publisher=[[TechCrunch]] | date=2015-02-18 | author=Buhr, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; their new cloud-based corporate LMS.  This launch followed $40 million raised in Series E funding, led by [[Insight Venture Partners]]. EPIC Ventures and [[Bessemer Venture Partners]] also participated in the funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/instructure-is-taking-on-corporate-learning-with-new-40m-round-2015-2 | title=Education tech startup Instructure has raised $40 million | publisher=[[Business Insider]] | date=2015-02-18 | author=Marino, Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This round raised their total lifetime funding to close to $90 million.  At launch, Bridge served six corporate clients, including [[Oregon State University]], which had also been using Instructure's Canvas LMS for their students.&lt;ref name="Locke, Charley"/&gt;

[[File:King-faisal sa faisal 318px 02.jpg|thumb|King Faisal of Saudi Arabia played a significant role in King Abdulaziz University's success.]]

'''King Abdulaziz University''' ('''KAU''') ({{lang-ar|جامعة الملك عبد العزيز}}) is a public university in [[Jeddah]], Saudi Arabia. Established initially in 1967 as a private university by a group of businessmen led by Muhammad Abu Bakr Bakhashab and including writer [[Hamza Bogary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://waqf.kau.edu.sa/content.aspx?Site_ID=808&amp;lng=EN&amp;cid=3310&amp;URL=www.kau.edu.sa King Abdulaziz University list of founders].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, King Abdulaziz University was converted to a [[public university]] by a decision of the Council Ministers of Saudi Arabia under [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|then-King Faisal's]] orders. In 2016, it was ranked the #1 [[Arab world|Arab]] university by [[Times Higher Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arab universities: The kingdom is king|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21695893-snapshot-regions-higher-education-kingdom-king|accessdate=3 April 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Private university ===

In the year 1964, the idea of establishing a private university in the city of [[Jeddah]] was originally put forward by [[Mohamed Ali Hafez]]. In the same year, a preparatory committee of 6 members was formed, including Mohamed Ali Hafez and Muhammad Abu Bakr Bakhashab. Shortly after, then-Crown Prince [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal]] officially approved the idea. In 1965, the university's executive committee was formed. In 1966, the KAU held a competition to design their logo. The winning design was submitted by Adbul-Halim Radwi, a local artist from Jeddah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undergraduateawards.com/king-abdulaziz-university-signs-3-year-partnership-with-the-undergraduate-awards/|title=King Abdulaziz University signs 3-year partnership with The Undergraduate Awards|website=Undergraduateawards.com|date=13 March 2015|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1967, King Abdulaziz University was officially established as a private university, with goals to spread higher education in the western region of [[Saudi Arabia]]. Prior to this date, there were no higher-education institutes in Jeddah. These goals were met through efforts of high-ranking businessmen and notable Saudi figures; and additionally with the help of King Faisal's encouragement and financial support. The university started its first academic year in 1968, with a relatively small number of students (68 male - 30 female). In 1969, the first faculty was established (Faculty of Economics and Administration). In 1970, the Faculty of Arts and Humanities was established.

=== Public university (1974-Present) ===

In 1974, the [[Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia]] decided to merge the university with the government; converting it to a public university. This major decision spurred the impressive transformation to where the university stands today. King Abdulaziz University has further witnessed tremendous quantitative and qualitative progress in terms of enrollment and diversity of academic programs. It is now recognized as a world-class university due to its international outreach and collaboration in research, innovation, accreditations and rankings. It does this while continuing to maintain its traditional commitment to delivering outstanding education and community service. {{as of|2017}}, it had almost 31,000 students, of which 28% are international, and is considered to be one of the best universities in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/king-abdulaziz-university|title=King Abdulaziz University|website=Timeshighereducation.com|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, it was ranked the 1st Arab university by ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' due to very strong citation impact and highly international outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfbusiness.com/revealed-top-10-universities-arab-region/|title=Revealed: Top 10 universities in the Arab region|website=Gulfbusiness.com|date=21 March 2018|author=Aarti Nagraj|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also ranked no. 1 in percentage of total publications with international collaboration, according to ''[[US News]]'' rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/king-abdulaziz-university-501597|title=King Abdulaziz University|website=Usnews.com|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Programs ==

Between 2004 and 2014, King Abdulaziz University enacted a program to attract the international community and has welcomed nearly 150 researches or various disciplines. The university has developed international research partners, including in [[Morocco]] where it has developed a joint lunar research program with the Astronomic Observatory of [[Oukaïmeden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lematin.ma/journal/2017/-laquo-avec-peu-de-moyens-et-beaucoup-de-volonte-nous-nous-sommes-arrimes-aux-meilleures-nations-raquo-/267828.html|title=Entretien avec le directeur de l'Observatoire astronomique de l'Oukaïmeden|website=Lematin.ma|date=26 February 2017|language=fr|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university has 13 different research centers, predominantly in the fields of medicine (medical genomes and osteoperosis), environment and energy, climate change, and desalination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cegmr.kau.edu.sa/Pages-Research-Staff.aspx|title=Research staff|website=Kau.edu.sa|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in the 1970s by [[Sami Angawi]], the research center on pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] (Hajj Research Center) conducts a series of works around the religious event, notably on the aspects of logistics surrounding the pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-hajj-stampede-saudi-arabia-20150924-story.html|title=Stampede near Mecca kills at least 717 pilgrims|website=Chicagotribune.com|date=24 September 2015|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the second oldest Japanese university,&lt;ref name="ku-sketch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/english/euni_int/e01_eυnka/enkaku.htm |title=Historical Sketch |accessdate=2007-07-17 |date= |year=2004 |month= |work=About Kyoto University |publisher=Kyoto University |pages= |quote= }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of Asia's highest ranked universities and one of Japan's [[National Seven Universities]]. One of Asia’s leading research-oriented institutions, Kyoto University is famed for producing world-class researchers, including [[List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Kyoto University|18 Nobel Prize laureates]], [[List of Fields Medal winners by university affiliation|2 Fields medalists]] and one [[Gauss Prize]] winner. It has the [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|most Nobel laureates of all universities in Asia]].

== History ==
Kyoto University's forerunner was the {{nihongo|'''Chemistry School'''|舎密局|''Seimi-kyoku''}} founded in [[Osaka, Osaka|Osaka]] in 1869, which, despite its name, taught physics as well. ({{lang|ja|舎密}} is a [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] of a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word [[:nl:Chemie|chemie]].) Later, the {{nihongo|'''Third Higher School'''|第三髙等學校|Daisan-kōtō-gakkō}} was established in the place of ''Seimi-kyoku'' in 1886, it then transferred to the university's present main campus in the same year.

{{nihongo|'''Kyoto Imperial University'''|京都帝國大學|Kyōto-teikoku-daigaku}} as a part of the [[National Seven Universities|Imperial University]] system was established on June 18, 1897,&lt;ref name="ku-sketch"/&gt; using the Third Higher School's buildings. The higher school moved to a patch of land across the street, where the Yoshida South Campus stands today. In the same year of the university's establishment, the College of Science and Technology was founded. The College of [[Law]] and the College of [[Medicine]] were founded in 1899, the College of Letters in 1906, expanding the university's activities to areas outside [[natural science]].

After [[World War II]], the current Kyoto University was established by merging the imperial university and the Third Higher School, which assumed the duty of teaching [[liberal arts]] as the {{nihongo|Faculty of Liberal Arts|教養部|Kyōyō-bu}}. The faculty was dissolved with the foundation of the {{nihongo|Faculty of [[Integrated Human Studies]]|総合人間学部|Sōgō-ningen-gakubu}} in 1992.

Kyoto University has since 2004 been incorporated as a national university corporation under a new law which applies to all national universities.

Despite the incorporation which has led to increased financial independence and autonomy, Kyoto University is still partly controlled by the {{nihongo|[[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Japanese Ministry of Education]]|[[:ja:文部科学省|文部科学省]]|Monbu-kagaku-shō}}.

The University's Department of Geophysics and their [[Disaster Prevention Research Institute]] are represented on the national [[Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction]].&lt;ref name=ccep-orgs&gt;[http://cais.gsi.go.jp/YOCHIREN/links.e.html#hoka Organizations with ties to CCEP] CCEP, accessed 2011-03-19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research performance===
Kyodai is usually considered as one of the top research institution in Japan. In fact, the 2nd largest amount of investment from [[:ja:科学研究費補助金|Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research]], which is the national grants program for research institutions.

This financial support from the Japanese government has a direct effect on Kyodai's research outcomes. According to [[Thomson Reuters]], Kyodai is the 1st best research university in Japan.&lt;ref name="Rankings_TR_N" /&gt; Its research excellence is especially distinctive in Chemistry (1st in Japan, 4th in the world), Biology &amp; Biochemistry (2nd in Japan, 23rd in the world), Pharmacology &amp; Toxicology (2nd in Japan,30 in the world), Immunology (3rd in Japan, 25th in the world), Material Science (4th in Japan, 22nd in the world), and Physics (4th in Japan, 25th in the world).&lt;ref name=executive&gt;{{cite web |title=Thomson Reuters 20 Top research institutions in Japan |publisher=Thomson Reuters |url=http://science.thomsonreuters.jp/press/release/2011/esi2011/ranking/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613213519/http://science.thomsonreuters.jp/press/release/2011/esi2011/ranking/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-06-13 |language=Japanese }} (this raking includes non-educational institutions)&lt;/ref&gt;

In another ranking, [[Nihon Keizai Shimbun|Nikkei Shimbun]] on 2004/2/16 surveyed about the research standards in [[Engineering|Engineering studies]] based on Thomson Reuters, [[:ja:科学研究費補助金|Grants in Aid for Scientific Research]] and questionnaires to the heads of 93 leading Japanese Research Centers. Kyodai was placed in the 10th position (research planning ability 6th) in this ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/katu-kobayashi/doppo/kougaku_kennkyu.htm |title=大学工学部研究力調査（04.2.22） |publisher=Homepage3.nifty.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507184047/http://homepage3.nifty.com/katu-kobayashi/doppo/kougaku_kennkyu.htm |archive-date=May 7, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kyodai also has a high research standard in Social Sciences &amp; Humanities. [[Repec]] in January 2011 ranked Kyodai's Institute of Economic Research as Japan's 3rd best economic research institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/top/old/1101/top.japan.html |title=Within Country and State Rankings at IDEAS: Japan |publisher=Ideas.repec.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyodai has provided 6 presidents of the [[Japanese Economic Association]] in its 42-year history, which is the 3rd largest number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeaweb.org/eng/AboutPresidents.html |title=Japanese Economic Association - JEA Global Site |publisher=Jeaweb.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asahi Shimbun]] summarized the amount of academic papers in Japanese major legal journals by university, and Kyodai was ranked 6th for the period between 2005 and 2009.&lt;ref name="Rankings_ASAHI_L"/&gt;

===Graduate school rankings===
Kyodai Law School is considered as one of the top Law schools in Japan, being ranked 4th in terms of  the number of successful candidates of Japanese [[Bar Examination]] in 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.shikakuseek.com/data/2010data-2.html |title=2010年(平成22年)新司法試験法科大学院別合格率ランキング -法科大学院seek |publisher=Laws.shikakuseek.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eduniversal]] ranked Japanese business schools, and the Faculty of Economics in Kyodai is placed 4th in Japan (111th in the world).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eduniversal-ranking.com/business-school-university-ranking-in-japan.html |title=University and business school ranking in Japan |publisher=Eduniversal-ranking.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alumni rankings===
Kyodai alumni are distinctively successful in Japanese industries such as shown below.

According to the [[:ja:エコノミスト (雑誌)|Weekly Economist]]'s 2010 rankings, graduates from Kyodai have the 10th best employment rate in 400 major companies in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ttcn.ne.jp/honkawa/3865.html|title=Employment rate in 400 major companies rankings |year=2011 |publisher=Weekly Economist |accessdate=Apr 29, 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has to be noted that this lower ranking position is because of the large number of alumni who become government bureaucrats, which is 2nd largest among Japanese universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ttcn.ne.jp/honkawa/3866.html |title=図録▽大学ランキング：国家公務員試験合格者数 |publisher=.ttcn.ne.jp |date=2011-01-19 |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, alumni of Kyodai's average salary is the 5th best in Japan, according to the [[:ja:プレジデント社|PRESIDENT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=大学偏差値情報局 at 02:51 - TrackBack(0) - 就職に強い大学ランキング |url=http://hensachi-ranking.seesaa.net/article/26733115.html#more |title=年収偏差値・給料偏差値ランキング（2006・10・16）：稼げる大学はどれ？ |publisher=Hensachi-ranking.seesaa.net |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mines ParisTech : Professional Ranking World Universities]] ranks Kyodai as 5th in the world in 2011 in terms of the number of alumni listed among CEOs in the 500 largest worldwide companies.&lt;ref name="Rankings_ENSMP_W" /&gt;

===Popularity and selectivity===
Kyodai is one of the most selective universities in Japan. Its entrance difficulty is usually considered as one of the top among 180 national and public universities.&lt;ref&gt;Private universities apply different kind of exams. Thus it's only comparable between universities in a same category.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[:ja:代々木ゼミナール|Yoyogi seminar]] published Hensachi (the indication showing the entrance difficulties by prep schools) rankings {{cite web|url=http://www.yozemi.ac.jp/rank/gakubu/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422110816/http://yozemi.ac.jp/rank/gakubu/index.html |archivedate=April 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Japanese journalist [[:ja:島野清志|Kiyoshi Shimano]] ranks its entrance difficulty as SA (most selective/out of 10 scales) in Japan. {{cite book |script-title=ja:危ない大学・消える大学 2012年版 |year=2011 |publisher=YELL books |isbn=4-7539-3018-1 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leland Todd Powers''' (January 28, 1857 – November 27, 1920) was an American [[Performing arts education|performing arts educator]], author, and actor. The founder of the [[Leland Powers School]], he was once renowned as "the highest paid man in the [[Lyceum]] field."&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, E.M. (1916). ''The book of Boston: Fifty years' recollections of the New England metropolis''. Book of Boston Co. p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Born in [[Pultneyville, New York]], Powers attended the [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]] and graduated there in 1875. In 1884, Powers gained popularity for acting all the roles in plays on his own, and was noted for being "the first man on the Lyceum platform in America to do this."&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, E.M. (1916). ''The book of Boston: Fifty years' recollections of the New England metropolis''. Book of Boston Co. p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888, he married his first wife Louise Baldwin. They were divorced in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;(March 23, 1897.) [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/03/23/102059211.pdf "Louise Baldwin Married"], ''New York Times''. Retrieved May 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually traveled across the country and to South America, and was noted as being the best paid performer on the Lyceum circuit in America between 1890 and 1900, during which time he was managed by the [[Redpath Lyceum Bureau]]. In 1895, he married Carol Hoyt Powers, and they had two children. The family were [[Christian Science|Christian Scientists]],&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, J.W. (1914) ''Woman's who's who of America: A biographical dictionary of contemporary women of the United States and Canada, 1914-1915. American Commonwealth Company. p 1695.&lt;/ref&gt;  with Carol Hoyt Powers serving a three-year term as Second Reader of [[The Mother Church]] in Boston.

In 1893, it was written that, "Leland Powers is small and active, and tropical in temperament, and he dare enact a play with great fidelity."&lt;ref&gt;(1893) ''Proceedings of the National Speech Arts Association. p 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Carol Hoyt on [[Christmas Eve]], 24 December 1895 in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]].

=== Leland Powers School ===
{{main|Leland Powers School}}

In 1904, he founded the Leland Powers School of the Spoken Word in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], joining his wife and more than a dozen staff members in teaching 140 students annually. Ten years later, in 1914, Powers had a building constructed in [[Fenway–Kenmore|the Fenway]] next door to the [[Girls' Latin School]]. From the school Powers sold several books, including ''Talks on Expression'', ''Fundamentals of Expression'' (with Mrs. Powers), and a practice book for learners.

Powers' pedagogy was credited as "offering a more holistic answer to the actor's problems," similar to his contemporary, [[Charles Wesley Emerson]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilmeth, D.B. and Miller, T.L. (1996) ''Cambridge guide to American theatre.'' Cambridge University Press. p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of educational institutions in the Philippines arranged according to the dates of their foundation'''. It comprises the list of the oldest schools in the [[Philippines]] sorted in various categories, and gives an overview of the development of education and higher learning in the Philippines. To be included in this list, an institution must satisfy a traditional definition of a formal educational institution at the time of its founding. Chronologically, an educational institution can only be included in the top ten in a certain category only if no other school has been proven, with reliable sources, to be older. Moreover, an addendum shall be attached in a category where an entry is disputed or defunct; this addendum shall consist of the next undisputed or still operating educational institution.

The oldest universities, colleges, vocational schools and the first modern public education system in Asia were created during the Spanish colonial period. The earliest schools were founded by Spanish Catholic missionaries. By the time Spain was replaced by the United States as the colonial power, Filipinos were among the most educated subjects in all of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coleman|2009|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7oiTkrg9tfUC&amp;pg=PA17 17–59]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''' Mbaasem Foundation''' is a foundation established by Ghanaian writer [[Ama Ata Aidoo]] in [[Accra]], Ghana, in 2000. It is a nonprofit foundation dedicated to supporting and promoting the work of African women writers,&lt;ref name=Mbaasem&gt;[https://mbaasem.wordpress.com/ "Welcome To Mbaasem"], Mbaasem Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aidoo2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aidoo|first=Ama Ata|title=The Girl who Can: And Other Stories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=slvD0sBCUTEC&amp;pg=PP3|year=2002|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=978-0-435-91013-6|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; to "establish and maintain a writing place for women".&lt;ref name="Osofisan2002"&gt;{{cite book|editor3=[[Femi Osofisan]]|editor-last= Banham|editor-first=Martin|editor2= James Gibbs|title=African Theatre: Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39ZBOA39DgEC&amp;pg=PA129|year=2002|publisher=James Currey Publishers|isbn=978-0-85255-596-5|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the rented headquarters of the foundation was "likened to the transformation of [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s home in [[Chicago]] into a literary haven and museum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=West Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vNNyAAAAMAAJ|year=2002|publisher=West Africa Publishing Company, Limited|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation states its mission as being "To support the development and sustainability of African women writers and their artistic output", and as its goal: "To create an enabling environment for women to write, tell and publish their stories."&lt;ref name=Mbaasem /&gt;

==History==

In January 2000 Ama Ata Aidoo started an initiative called '''Mbaasem''' (meaning "women’s words, women’s affairs" in [[Akan language|Akan]])&lt;ref name=CWG /&gt; based in Accra, Ghana, with the goal of building a women writers' centre and residency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wworld.org/archive/annual_report2000.htm Annual Report 1999-2000], Women's WORLD.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently incorporated as a registered non-governmental organization, the Mbaasem Foundation reflects the mission of its founder "to develop and support the sustainability of the work of African women writers who are usually sidelined in the industry".&lt;ref&gt;Kundai Mugwanda-Nyamutenha,

In 2012 Mbaasem launched a three-year project to develop a literacy manifesto to improve the literacy rate within Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;Marian Ansah, [http://efeansah1990.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/mbaasem-foundation-launches-manifesto.html "Mbaasem Foundation Launches manifesto To Bridge Literacy Gap"], 8 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other activities include organizing the "Mbaasem Writing Contest for Girls", funded by the US Embassy of Ghana and [[The Royal Bank]] Ltd, with GHC 1000 as the top prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gowomanafrica.com/mbaasem-writing-contest-for-girls-deadline-january-31st-2015/ "Mbaasem Writing Contest for Girls"], ''GoWoman'',

The Mbaasem Foundation has also been involved in international conferences for women writers. In 2013, it collaborated with the [[Organization of Women Writers of Africa]] (OWWA), [[New York University]] (NYU), and the [[Spanish Fundación Mujeres por África]] (Women for Africa Foundation) to present a major conference in Accra, ''Yari Yari Ntoaso: Continuing the Dialogue – An International Conference on Literature by Women of African Ancestry'', held from 16 to 19 May.&lt;ref name=CWG&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativewritingghana.wordpress.com/tag/mbaasem/|title=Yari Yari Ntoaso: An International Conference in Ghana on Literature by Women of African Ancestry|publisher=Creative Writing Ghana|date=20 April 2013|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghanaian writers and scholars including Ama Ata Aidoo, [[Amma Darko]], [[Ruby Goka]], [[Mamle Kabu]], [[Esi Sutherland-Addy]] and [[Margaret Busby]] were invited to speak at the event, and among notable participants from other parts of the world who attended were [[Angela Davis]] of the USA, [[Tess Onwueme]] of Nigeria, [[Natalia Molebatsi]] of South Africa, [[Yolanda Arroyo Pizarro]] of Puerto Rico, [[Véronique Tadjo]] of Côte d'Ivoire, and [[Évelyne Trouillot]] of Haiti.&lt;ref name=CWG /&gt;

'''''Memoria Chilena''''' (Spanish for ''Chilean Memory'') is a [[Chile]]an cultural website which, according to its own words, "offers investigations and documents related to key topics which make up the Chilean identity, accessible through the areas of history, literature, social sciences, music, and visual arts."{{refn|group=n|Original Spanish quote: "ofrece investigaciones y documentos relativos a los temas claves que conforman la identidad de Chile, accesibles a través de las áreas de Historia, Literatura, Ciencias Sociales, Música y Artes Visuales."}} ''Memoria Chilena'' is, also, a virtual library, which preserves material from the [[Biblioteca Nacional de Chile]] and other institutions from the Dirección de Bibliotecas, Archivos y Museos (DIBAM).&lt;ref name="biobio"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.biobiochile.cl/2012/05/06/memoria-chilena-libros-fotos-y-documentos-online-gratuitos-que-construyen-nuestra-historia.shtml |title="Memoria Chilena": libros, fotos y documentos online gratuitos que construyen nuestra historia |last=Flores |first=Jonathan |date=6 May 2012 |work=[[Radio Bío Bío]] |location=Concepción, Chile |accessdate=11 October 2013 |language=Spanish |deadurl=no |archivedate=11 October 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6KICDkZe6?url=http://www.biobiochile.cl/2012/05/06/memoria-chilena-libros-fotos-y-documentos-online-gratuitos-que-construyen-nuestra-historia.shtml |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original idea of ''Memoria Chilena'' was conceived in 2001. The website states that, "until now, our objective has been to spread through the Internet the cultural heritage of Chile, contributing to the recuperation, preservation and strengthening of our historic memory."{{refn|group=n|Original Spanish quote: "hasta hoy, nuestro objetivo ha sido difundir a través de Internet el patrimonio cultural de Chile, contribuyendo a la recuperación, preservación y fortalecimiento de nuestra memoria histórica."}}&lt;ref name="biobio"/&gt;

==Organization==
''Memoria Chilena'' organizes its material through topic sites (sitios temáticos), which "approach processes, events, people or relevant works from the Chilean cultural and historic imaginary."{{refn|group=n|Original Spanish quote: "abordan los procesos, hechos, personajes u obras relevantes del imaginario cultural e histórico de Chile."}} Topic sites include a general presentation or description, galleries of images, digitized documents, related bibliography, chronology, links to related topic sites or websites, and sound files. ''Memoria Chilena'', as of May 2012, had 2,800 digitized books, 250 maps of Chile (dated between 1768 and 1929), in addition to an "innumerable" quantity of photographs related to the Chilean history.&lt;ref name="biobio"/&gt;

==Copyright==
''Memoria Chilena'' publishes documents and images which belong to collections of the National Library of Chile and other institutions of the DIBAM, which are property of this latter or are otherwise in the [[public domain]]. However, digitized materials whose copyright status is active, are used with permission from the copyright owners, for their "exclusive publication in the website." The website also states that "any use of the material published in ''Memoria Chilena'' without consent of the copyright owners, is penalized by the Law of Intellectual Property."{{refn|group=n|Original Spanish quote: "[c]ualquier uso del material difundido en Memoria Chilena sin la autorización de los titulares de sus derechos, está penado por la Ley sobre Propiedad Intelectual."}}

{{distinguish|Object Lessons (novel)}}
An '''object lesson''' is a [[teaching method]] that consists of using a physical object or [[visual aid]] as a discussion piece for a lesson.
{{Wiktionary}}
==Description==

The object lesson approach is promoted in the educational philosophy of [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]], who held that teaching should begin with observation of objects which help students recognize concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lessonstudygroup.net/lg/readings/TheOriginofLessonStudyinJapanMakinaeN/TheOriginofLessonStudyinJapanMakinaeN.pdf MAKINAE, Naomichi. 2010. "The Origin of Lesson Study in Japan." Paper presented at EARCOME5, Japan Society of Mathematical Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Object lessons were important elements in teaching during the [[Victorian era]] of the mid- to late-nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hpsmuseumleeds.wordpress.com/2012/12/05/object-lessons/ "Object lessons" HPS Museum Blog (at the University of Leeds), 5 December 2012] ''(accessed 16 March 2013)''&lt;/ref&gt; They are commonly used in [[religious instruction]].

{{Eastern Slavic name|Dmitryevna|Forsh}}
'''Olga Dmitryevna Forsh''' ({{lang-ru|О́льга Дми́триевна Форш}}, {{lang|ru-latn|Oljga Dmitrijevna Forš}}), née Komarova ({{lang-ru|Комаро́ва}}) ({{OldStyleDate|May 28|1873|May 16}}{{spaced ndash}}July 17, 1961), was a Russian/Soviet novelist, dramatist, memoirist, and scenarist.

==Early life==
Forsh was born in the fortress at [[Gunib]], in [[Dagestan Oblast|Dagestan]], the daughter of a major general in the Russian Imperial Army. Her father met her mother, Nina Shakhetdinova, an [[Azerbaijan]]ian, while he was stationed in the [[Caucasus]]. Nina died when Olga was very young. Olga's stepmother, who was also her former nurse, showed little interest in her, especially after the birth of her own daughter by Olga's father. When her father, Major General Komarov, died in 1881 Olga was placed in an orphanage for children of the nobility.&lt;ref name="Women"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Russian Women Writers |year=1994 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0-313-26265-9 |pages=183–184 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lI4hPO8u3ecC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=olga+forsh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Alr1Tu3IL_LMiQKrvOG4Dg&amp;ved=0CHMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=olga%20forsh&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite book |title=An Anthology of Russian Women's Writing, 1777-1992 |last=Kelly |first=Catriona |year=1994 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-871505-6 |page=243 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fO9fAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=An+Anthology+of+Russian+Women%27s+Writing&amp;dq=An+Anthology+of+Russian+Women%27s+Writing&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2ScPToeELoaMswaGm635Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She married Boris Eduardovich Forsh, who had also been born into the family of a high-ranking military officer, in 1895. In the 1890s she studied at various art schools,&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; most importantly in [[Kiev]] and St Petersburg, where she worked in the studio of [[Pavel Chistyakov]].&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt;

In 1904 Boris Forsh resigned from the military in objection to his having to serve at the executions of political prisoners. He was deprived of his salary, and he and Olga moved to a farm in the Ukraine with their two children. Olga was also pregnant at the time. She later attributed the inspiration for her early stories to this extended period of living among the peasantry. Her first works of fiction were published in 1907. She continued drawing and painting, and worked as an art teacher at the Levitskaya School in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] in 1910-11, but she turned toward writing as time went by.&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt;

==Career==
Olga was interested in the fashionable ideas of the time, including [[Tolstoyan movement|Tolstoyanism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[Buddhism]],&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; but was increasingly drawn to Socialism. After the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]] Olga and her husband became active supporters of the [[Bolshevik]]s. Olga's husband died of [[typhus]] while serving with the [[Red Army]] in Kiev.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; After his death she continued to dedicate herself to cultural work.&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt;

She devoted several novels to the history of revolutionary thought and the revolutionary movement in Russia. Among them are ''Palace and Prison'' (1924–25, also made into a film script), about the revolutionary Mikhail Stepanovich Beideman, ''The Fervid Workshop'' (1926), about the Revolution of 1905–07, and ''Pioneers of Freedom'' (1950–53), which deals with the [[Decembrists]]. She also wrote the three-part [[biographical novel]] ''[[Alexander Radishchev|Radishchev]]'', which comprises the books ''Jacobin Leaven'' (1932), ''The Landlady of Kazan'' (1934–35), and ''The Pernicious Book'' (1939). Her experimental play ''The Substitute Lecturer'' was published in 1930.&lt;ref name="Soviet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Olga+Forsh |title=The Great Soviet Encyclopedia |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fate of the creative individual under an oppressive regime is treated in the novel ''The Contemporaries'' (1926), which is about [[Nikolay Gogol]] and A. A. Ivanov. In the novels ''The Lunatic Ship'' (1931) and ''The Raven'' (originally titled ''The Symbolists'', 1933), Olga portrayed life among the St Petersburg artistic intelligentsia in the early 20th century and the first post revolutionary years and created portraits of such contemporaries as [[Maxim Gorky]], [[Alexander Blok]] and [[Fyodor Sologub]].&lt;ref name="Soviet"/&gt;

==Later life==
Olga rose to prominence in the arena of Soviet literature,&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; playing important roles at the [[USSR Union of Writers|1934 Congress of Writers]], and at the 1954 Congress, where she gave the opening address.&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt; She was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]] (twice) and the [[Order of the Badge of Honour]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Olga Forsh article at ru.wikipedia ([[:ru:Форш, Ольга Дмитриевна]])&lt;/ref&gt;

She died in Tyarlova, a suburb of Leningrad, in 1961. She was buried in the [[Kazan]] Cemetery, on the outskirts of [[Pushkin (town)|Pushkin]].&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt;

'''Open-Sankoré''' was a [[Free and open source software|free and open-source]] [[interactive whiteboard]] software compatible with any projector and pointing device.

Open-Sankoré development stopped but the fork [[OpenBoard]] remains active.

==History==
Open-Sankoré is based on the Uniboard software originally developed at the [[University of Lausanne]], Switzerland. The software started to be developed in 2003 and was first used by the teachers of the University in October 2003. The project was later spun off to a local startup company, Mnemis SA. It was subsequently sold to the French Public Interest Grouping for Digital Education in Africa (GIP ENA) which bought the intellectual property of the software in order to make it an open source project&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/Sankore/&lt;/ref&gt; under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL).&lt;ref name="SankoreHistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://open-sankore.org/en/history |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201063949/http://open-sankore.org/en/history |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 February 2012 |title=History |publisher=Open-Sankoré |accessdate=26 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DIENA was founded to share the software in African countries and develop free educational material&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://planete.sankore.org/xwiki/bin/view/Search/WebHome|title=Sankoré - WebHome|last=Administrator|first=Administrator|website=planete.sankore.org|access-date=2016-04-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507002310/http://planete.sankore.org/xwiki/bin/view/Search/WebHome|archivedate=2016-05-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since September 2014 [[OpenBoard]],&lt;ref&gt;http://edu.ge.ch/sem/equipement/outils/openboard-logiciel-libre-denseignement-numerique-interactif-1223&lt;/ref&gt; a fork based on Open-Sankoré 2.0&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/OpenEducationFoundation/OpenBoard|title=OpenEducationFoundation/OpenBoard|website=GitHub|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; is developed by the educational administration of Geneva (Swiss). This lighter version works better on Mac OS. A new version based on [[Qt (software)|Qt]] 5.5 should solve existing bugs.

Since November 2015 neither DIENA&lt;ref&gt;http://www.educationnumeriquepourtous.com/new/diena.htm&lt;/ref&gt; nor Open-Sankoré&lt;ref&gt;http://open-sankore.org/fr/node/7&lt;/ref&gt; respond to emails. The source of Open-Sankoré was last changed in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/Sankore/&lt;/ref&gt; A new version should be developed for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adte.ca/logiciels-libres.html|title=Logiciels libres|website=adte.ca|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014 a [[fork]], [[OpenBoard]],&lt;ref&gt;http://edu.ge.ch/sem/equipement/outils/openboard-logiciel-libre-denseignement-numerique-interactif-1223&lt;/ref&gt; is developed by the education administration of Geneva, [http://edu.ge.ch/sem/ écoles-médias (SEM)]. It's based on Open-Sankoré 2.0 [https://github.com/OpenEducationFoundation/OpenBoard version 2.0] with Qt4, better for Mac OS X. The source code of Open-Sankoré was developed until September 2015 but bug appears on Mac and Windows.

It should be an Open-Sankoré 2.5.2 in 2017&lt;ref&gt;http://adte.ca/logiciels-libres.html&lt;/ref&gt; (current version 2.5.1). The French education administration is building a new concept until June 2016&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/sankore2015/status/705392691710980097&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Direction du numérique pour l'éducation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.education.gouv.fr/cid77084/direction-du-numerique-pour-l-education-dne.html|title=Direction du numérique pour l'éducation [DNE]|website=Ministère de l'Éducation nationale, de l'Enseignement supérieur et de la Recherche|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; (DNE).

==Innovations==
Open-Sankoré is the first feature-complete open-source interactive whiteboard. In contrast to other similar software, its file format is text-based and uses a [[W3C]] web standard, allowing to be displayed in a modern web browser and enabling lessons to be distributed online without additional software. Second, the software can be extended using W3C-compliant widgets, allowing user flexibility.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Impact==
The French government has set up an Interministerial Delegation for Digital Education in Africa (DIENA) and a Public Interest Grouping for Digital Education in Africa (GIP ENA) in order to implement a multi-year program for developing digital education in many African partner countries. Open-Sankoré is one of the strategies of this group to try to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]] for education in Africa, an initiative of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="SankoreProgram"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sankore.org/en/how-did-program-come-about |title=How did the program come about? |publisher=Sankoré |accessdate=24 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201232709/http://sankore.org/en/how-did-program-come-about |archivedate=1 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otto Aron Salomon''' (1849-1907) was a Swedish educator and both a noted writer and proponent of educational [[sloyd]]. Born in [[Gothenburg, Sweden]] in 1849, Salomon studied at the Institute of Technology in Stockholm but left after a year to accept a position as Director of the Sloyd Teachers Seminary in Naas, Sweden. It was while at the seminary that Salomon was able to popularize the educational sloyd movement.

'''Paul Engle''' (October 12, 1908 – March 22, 1991), was an American [[poet]], [[copyediting|editor]], teacher, literary critic, [[novelist]], and playwright.  He is remembered as the long-time director of the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] and as founder of the [[International Writing Program]] (IWP), both at the [[University of Iowa]].

==Life==
Engle has been mistakenly credited with having founded the Iowa Writers' Workshop (an honor that more appropriately belongs to his predecessor, [[Wilbur Schramm]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}  Nonetheless, perhaps no one better helped to establish the reputation of the venerable writing program than Engle.  During his tenure as director (1941–1965), he was responsible for luring some of the finest writers of the day to [[Iowa City]].  [[Robert Lowell]], [[John Berryman]], [[Robie Macauley]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]] and many other prominent novelists and poets served as faculty under Engle. He increased enrollment and oversaw numerous students of future fame and influence, including [[Flannery O'Connor]], [[Philip Levine (poet)|Philip Levine]], [[Mark Costello (author)|Mark Costello]], [[Marvin Bell]], [[Joe Nicholson]], [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]], [[Donald Justice]], [[Raymond Carver]], [[Douglas Kent Hall]], [[Andre Dubus]], and [[Robert Bly]].  During his tenure, Engle raised millions of dollars in support of the program whose shape and direction proved the model for the hundreds of writing programs that have followed.

Vonnegut described Engle in a 1967 letter in this fashion: "The former head, Paul Engle, is still around, is a hayseed clown, a foxy grandpa, a terrific promoter, who, if you listen closely, talks like a man with a paper asshole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2012/11/20/kurt_vonnegut_the_author_s_advice_for_a_friend_about_to_teach_at_the_iowa.html|title=Kurt Vonnegut: the author's advice for a friend about to teach at the Iowa Writers' Workshop|work=Slate Magazine|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, following his departure as director of the workshop, Engle and future second wife [[Hualing Nieh Engle|Nieh Hualing]] co-founded The University of Iowa's [[International Writing Program]], which provided for dozens of published authors from around the world to visit Iowa City each year to write and collaborate.  Engle left the Writer's Workshop permanently in 1969 to devote himself full-time to the international program. He sponsored and admitted many who would have been executed if they had remained home. Many Cambodians and Vietnamese writers owe him their lives.

Born Paul Hamilton Engle in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], to Thomas Allen, a livery stable owner, and Evelyn (Reinheiner) Engle, Engle grew up in the Wellington Heights section of Cedar Rapids. He graduated from [[Washington High School (Cedar Rapids, Iowa)]], and later attended [[Coe College]] (class of 1931), [[The University of Iowa]], [[Columbia University]], and [[Oxford University]] (where he studied as a [[Rhodes Scholar]]).  As a student at Iowa, Engle was one of the earliest recipients of an advanced degree awarded for creative work: his first collection ''Worn Earth'', which went on to win the [[Yale Series of Younger Poets]].  His second book, ''American Song'' (1934), was given a rave front-page review in the [[New York Times Book Review]] and was even, briefly, a bestseller.  From 1954 to 1959, Engle served as series editor for the [[O. Henry Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=2047|title=Paul Engle|work=poetryfoundation.org|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his death (in [[Chicago]]'s [[O'Hare Airport]] on his way to accept an award in Poland), Engle was the author of more than a dozen collections of poetry, a novel, a memoir, an opera libretto (for [[Philip Bezanson]]), and even a children's book. Engle wrote numerous articles and reviews for many of the largest periodicals of his day.

His papers are held at the [[University of Iowa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/spec-coll/MSC/ToMsC550/MsC514/msc514.html|title=Papers of Paul Engle - Special Collections - The University of Iowa Libraries|work=uiowa.edu|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Coe College]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.public.coe.edu/departments/Library/FindingAids/Paul_Engle.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tashkent Automobile and Road Construction Institute''' was established in [[Tashkent]], Uzbekistan to cover the high demands for professionals in the transportation and automobile field. 

== About the Institute ==
The Tashkent Automobile and Road Construction Institute (TARCI) is known as the only one and unique institute in Central Asia which focuses on training highly qualified professional engineers on automobile and road construction fields. It was first established during [[Soviet]] times by the edict of Uzbek government number 697 on 27 December of the year 1971 and by the edict of "Ministry of Higher and Secondary Education Affairs" number 27 on 21 January of the year 1972 under the base of automobile-road faculty at "Tashkent Poly Technical Institute". The first academic year at the institute started on 1 September 1972. 

Tashkent Automobile and Road Construction Institute's main building is located in the center of Tashkent, near to the metro station "Oybek" and next to the "[[State Museum of Arts]]" of Uzbekistan. The Tashkent Automobile and Road Construction Institute is well known as one of the leading universities of Central Asia in fields of auto-constructing, automobile transports, road and airport construction. The campus of the university is fully supplied with modern rooms to hold classes, with rooms for experimental subjects and a techno park. 

There are 3&lt;!--SPELL OUT SINGLE DIGITS PLEASE--&gt; academicians from "[[Uzbek Academy of Sciences]]", 4 representatives of Uzbek sciences, 38 doctors of sciences, who give their lectures at the university.

There are four faculties at the university and till 2006 the Tashkent Automobile and Road Construction Institute had a special faculty for gifted students. However, nowadays this faculty is closed, meanwhile gifted students are having the chance of studying at the libraries and scientific centers under the institute's administration. Lectures at the institute are mainly given in [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] and [[Russian language]]s, but gifted students are given chance to have lectures in English language. There are 4000 students who enter the institute every year, to obtain their bachelor's and master's degrees. 

The campus of the institute also consists of big library with the 400 thousand books, scientific and literal materials. TARCI has its own polygraphing center and complex of dormitories. TARCI has created big scientific schools for its students which are created by the representative of science in Uzbekistan. 

The main role in development of the TARCI plays cooperation with many international universities, local and global corporations. 450 successful graduates from TARCI, who graduated from TARCI between 1978 and 2004, are currently emplo in 25 foreign countries.

Nowadays, TARCI is training specialists in 11 branches of bachelor's degree and 17 branches for master's degree. 57 percent of all the teachers at institute have their scientific degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tayi.uz/institut-tarixi/18-institut-tarixi.html History of Institute] checked 27 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Faculties ==

There are 4 faculties currently acting at TARCI and they are: “Transport and Transport Communications Control Faculty”, “Road Construction Faculty”, “Automobile Transport Exploitation Faculty”, “Auto mechanics Faculty”. All of the faculties are based on automobile and road constructing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tayi.uz/facultet/ Faculties of Institute official web-page] checked 27 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport and Transport Communications Control Faculty ===
The main goal of the transport and transport communications faculty is covering high local demands for professionals on transports field. The dean of the faculty is Yuldasheva Saodat Arslanovna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tayi.uz/facultet/ Faculties of Institute official web-page] checked 27 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Road Construction Faculty === 
The history of this faculty is linked with the history of the institute, as it was created simultaneously with the TARCI in 1972. The head of the faculty was docent S.X. Xusnitdinov, who controlled the faculty till the year of 1979. In the first years there were 4 departments in the faculty, which were "Automobile Roads Planning", "Exploitation of Automobile Roads", "Road Constructing Materials", "Road Constructing Machines". When it was established there were 117 students engaged with the studies.

In 1979 it was renamed to "Road Construction Faculty". 1972–86 there were 7 departments, 1987–95 there were 12–14 departments, 1995–2000 there were 7 departments and currently there are 4 departments at the faculty. Currently, the dean of "Road Construction Faculty" is Salimova Barno Jamalovna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tayi.uz/facultet/ Faculties of Institute official web-page] checked 27 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oliygoh.uz/oliygoh/70 Second source information about the faculty] checked 27 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Automobile Transport Exploitation Faculty ===

The Automobile Transport Exploitation Faculty is the oldest faculty of the institute, it was created even before the TARCI in 1943, under the "Central Asian Industrial Institute", which is now [[Tashkent State Technical University]]. However, initially it was established as the department in ''Mechanics Faculty'' and was called "Automobiles". First head of the department was G.A. Kuzminov.

On the base of this department "Automobile Roads" faculty was established in 1969. After creation of TARCI 1972 the faculty was given to the institute and was renamed to its current name, which is "Automobile Transport Exploitation Faculty".

Conti which covers combat-related situations arising in the course of standard law enforcement. Together with ''Police Pistolcraft'', it forms the basis for the current pistol training program of the [[Massachusetts State Police]]&lt;ref name="officer.com"/&gt; and has been adopted by a range of other law enforcement jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Case Head"&gt;{{Cite web |title=New Book From Michael Conti |work=The Case Head  |publisher=Massachusetts Law Encorcement Firearms Instructors &amp; Armorers Association  |date=Fall 2009 |url=http://www.mlefiaa.org/files/CaseHead/FALL_2009.pdf |page=5 |accessdate=15 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''The Officer's Guide to Police Pistolcraft'' describes a method of training and philosophy of pistolcraft developed by Michael E. Conti, an officer of the Massachusetts State police, and follows and expands Conti's 2007 book ''Police Pistolcraft''.

Conti joined the Massachusetts State Police in 1986 and as of 2009 is still a serving officer. During his career, he has held assignments ranging from uniformed patrol, high-crime area community policing, [[SWAT]] and special security details, and undercover narcotics and death investigations.  Since 1991 he has acted as a professional trainer and holds instructor certifications in various use of force disciplines.

In January 2000, Conti was given the task of setting up and putting into operation a Firearms Training Unit (FTU) for the State Police. The unit was to be responsible for conducting yearly qualification courses of fire for department personnel, and for training academy recruits in firearms use.  As part of his work in this role, Conti developed a new style of training which he describes as "reality-based", as he felt that the traditional sight-oriented and marksmanship-based approach that was until that time being used did not meet the needs of police officers on the street.

The new style of training emphasised [[Rex Applegate|Applegate-style]] target focused shooting, complemented by sight-focused precision shooting at appropriate distances.  Conti constructed a purpose-built training facility at Massachusetts State Police headquarters to demonstrate his revised training program.&lt;ref name="officer.com"/&gt;

In 2007 Conti used this new training paradigm as the basis of his book ''Police Pistolcraft''. Following the publication of that book, a demand emerged for a text detailing the specific methods of the "new paradigm," which led Conti to write ''The Officer's Guide to Police Pistolcraft''.&lt;ref name="officer.com"/&gt;  Conti is also the author of ''Beyond Pepper Spray: The Complete Guide to Chemical Agents, Delivery Systems, and Protective Masks'' (Paladin Press, 2002).

==Critical and professional reception==
The training methods described in ''The Officer's Guide to Police Pistolcraft'' are currently in use by the Massachusetts State Police, and the book and associated training philosophy has been adopted by law enforcement agencies in many other jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Case Head"/&gt;

The critical reception among law enforcement reviewers has been generally positive.

Ralph Mroz of the Police Officers Safety Association, in a review at Officer.com, described the book as "different... and necessary!"  He said the book was "written by a consummate police training professional" and went on to say, "I recommend it as highly as I recommended (and continue to recommend) the earlier ''Police Pistolcraft''."   Mroz singled out the "frank discussion of the necessary relationship between a professional police officer and his/her skill with arms" as "as refreshing as it is unusual these days".&lt;ref name="officer.com"/&gt;

John Veit reviewed the book in a widely republished article on Law Officer Connect, where he praised the book, calling attention to its plain English language and conversational style.  "Some chapters read like a good novel and not a field manual," he said.  "They are filled with helpful and practical ways of carrying out the day to day tasks of an officer."  He concluded, "This book is a very good read, and promises to be a long standing and authoritative survival guide for police officers as well as others who have a handgun for self defense use."

The Massachusetts Law Encorcement Firearms Instructors &amp; Armorers Association reviewed the book for their publication ''The Case Head''.  They said, "The Officer's Guide is full of solid training information, photos and diagrams," and applauded Conti's style, saying, "I could not help but notice how the reader is treated with respect.  [...] This will be perfect for the officer who was looking for better firearms training but was unable to get it at their agency."  They praised Conti's refusal to enter into a philosophical battle between point-shooting and aimed fire, saying, "The New Paradigm takes the best of all worlds and rolls them into one program."  The Association concluded by saying the book "is highly recommended and will be a well used addition to every firearms instructor’s reference library. If you have adopted the New Paradigm, this book should be standard issue for every student you have."&lt;ref name="Case Head"/&gt;

==Contents==
''The Officer's Guide to Police Pistolcraft'' contains 424 pages, divided into 12 chapters and illustrated with 316 photos and diagrams.&lt;ref name="officer.com"/&gt;  It sets out what the author calls "the reality-based new paradigm of police firearms training," a program he claims to have developed in 2000 while serving as the Director of the Massachusetts State Police Firearms Training Unit. It contains helpful and practical advice about carrying out the day-to-day tasks of a law enforcement officer, and also deals with the obligations and responsibilities of "the modern day warrior."  It aims to provide specific detail on subjects covered in ''Police Pistolcraft'' and instruct on when a law enforcement officer should use their pistol, and how they should use it.

The book focuses on combat and specifically aims to prepare officers to know when to use their pistol and how to use it. The training system covers both sighted and point shooting techniques, drawing on systems of combat pistol shooting and training originating from such diverse sources as World War II and "the dim and dark streets and back alleys of Shanghai."

The book's main emphasis is on pistol training that recognises the reality of day-to-day police operations, rather than the isolated competitive training previously in use.

Specific topics covered include safety, pistol handling and manipulation, basic skills and alternative shooting positions, pistol retention, mental preparation, low light, plainclothes considerations and left-hand shooter considerations.  There is a section about the issues that female officers face in both uniformed and plain clothes assignments.  An appendix covers revolvers, as the author feels many new recruits in modern law enforcement have never seen one.&lt;ref name="officer.com"/&gt;

Vinson has also studied the impact of cumulative medico-social problems and life opportunities generally. The determinative influence of education (or life prospects) has remained a theme in this strand of his research, culminating in the recent publication of an influential study on the distribution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Postcodes and Poverty |work=The National Interest |publisher=ABC Radio |location=Australia |year=2005 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/natint/stories/s1257321.htm |accessdate=10 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of social disadvantage in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[New South Wales]].
&lt;!-- [[File:ComadversVinson.jpg|left|thumb| ''Community Adversity and Resilience: the distribution of social disadvantage''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Community Adversity and Resilience
| publisher = Jesuit Social Services
| date = 2004

| accessdate = 10 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Deletable image-caption|Monday, 7 March 2011|date=March 2011}}]] --&gt;

His work as the Foundation Professor in [[Behavioural science]] within the [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]] (NSW) in the 1970s followed research into connections between social factors, and pregnancy outcomes, including the health and progress of young children. At Newcastle, an important educational experience was his involvement in the development of the problem-based learning approach adopted for the new medical course. This approach incorporated many of the key elements of the educational approach considered as somewhat radical departures in the field of school education. Vinson also instigated the broadly based admission procedures adopted by the medical faculty.

Following three years as Head of the [[New South Wales Department of Corrective Services|NSW Department of Corrective Services]] (1979–81) during a period of intense penal reform, Vinson took up an appointment as Professor of [[Social Work]] at the [[University of New South Wales]]. Over subsequent years he has served as [[Head of School]] and [[Dean (education)|Dean]]. He has twice been a Visiting Professor at the [[University of Stockholm]] and has observed the operation of [[Sweden|Swedish]] social services, including early schooling. There have also been Visiting Professor appointments in the [[Netherlands]] and government consultancies in the South Pacific. In 1980 Vinson chaired a [[Commonwealth]] Government Inquiry into health and social services in the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]].

In recent years Vinson has had an extensive involvement in assessing schemes to protect children exposed to the dangers of abuse. Some of these projects have included the evaluation of professional practices, including the co-operation of schools with government and non-government services. Others have dealt with the social contexts and environments in which abusive practices occur. This work has been published internationally in journals such as the ''British Journal of Social Work'' and ''Modern Medicine'' as well as within Australia by the Institute of Criminology and other authorities.

On Vinson's initiative, the [[UNSW School of Social Work]], in partnership with the [[Housing NSW|NSW Department of Housing]], residents, and local community bodies, formed a community development centre on the Waterloo Housing Estate. Tony Vinson has had the title Professor [[Emeritus]] conferred on him by the University of New South Wales.

=== Tony Vinson Centre for Community Development ===
This purpose-built community centre in [[Mildura]], named after Vinson is designed to co-locate agency programs Chances for Children, Reading Discovery, Learning for Life, The Portland House Project and the proposed Youth Engagement Program for Early years. It opened in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Funding for the Tony Vinson Centre for Community Development |publisher=The Ian Potter Foundation |year=2008 |url=http://foundation.ianpotter.org.au/recent_grants_awarded.html |accessdate=10 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Vinson Inquiry'' ===

The Vinson Inquiry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The New South Wales Public Education Inquiry |work=The New South Wales Public Education Inquiry |year=2003 |url=http://www.pub-ed-inquiry.org/ |accessdate=10 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was commissioned by the [[New South Wales Teachers Federation]] and the Federation of Parents and Citizens Associations in 2002 to consider the state of public education in New South Wales and provide recommendations for the future. The inquiry visited and conducted public hearings at schools and [[Technical and further education|TAFE]] colleges throughout the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Former public education inquiry head Tony Vinson dies |author=New South Wales Teachers Federation |date=2017-02-20 |url=https://www.nswtf.org.au/news/2017/02/20/vale-professor-tony-vinson.html |accessdate=20 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recommendations of the inquiry caused controversy, in a large part due to its recommendation that the number of academically [[Selective school (New South Wales)|selective high schools]] and [[opportunity class]]es be significantly reduced.&lt;ref name=smh_axe&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/07/23/1027332378883.html Axe hovers over selective high schools] [[Sydney Morning Herald]]. 24 July 2002. Retrieved 2 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite support for the report from the [[Minister for Education (New South Wales)|Education Minister]] [[John Watkins (Australian politician)|John Watkins]],&lt;ref name=smh_axe/&gt; most of the recommendations, including those on academically selective education, were not acted upon.

=== ''Dropping off the Edge'' ===
&lt;!--[[File:DroppingVinson.jpg|right|thumb|The cover to ''Dropping off the Edge''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''Dropping off the Edge'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dropping off the edge |publisher=Jesuit &amp; Catholic social services |year=2007 |url=http://www.australiandisadvantage.org.au/ |accessdate=10 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the distribution of disadvantage in Australia was the most comprehensive national study of its kind. The report, which is a joint project with [[Jesuit Social Services]] and Catholic Social Services Australia was written by Vinson, providing a picture of areas of entrenched disadvantage nationally. The report found that just 1.7 per cent of postcodes and communities across Australia accounted for more than seven times their share of top rank positions on the major factors that cause intergenerational poverty. Vinson said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Our findings demand recognition of a common pattern associated with inadequate education and training–unemployment, low income, poor health and 'making ends meet' by criminal means, resulting in high rates of convictions and imprisonment. Where these characteristics are concentrated there, too, we find high levels of confirmed child maltreatment."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Judicial accountability ===
In September 1986 Vinson released a report dealing with the sentencing of drug cases in the [[NSW District Court]] between 1980 and 1982, which purported to find that a particular judge had exercised leniency in dealing with clients of a particular solicitor. It was revealed later that Judge [[John Foord]] was the judge in question. He was stood down from the District Court in September 1986 and resigned on medical grounds later that year. One consequence of these and other events was the passing of the [[Judicial Officers Act 1986]], establishing a formalised system of judicial accountability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Principles, Personalities, Politics: Parliamentary Privilege Cases in NSW |publisher=Parliament of NSW |year=2004 |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/publications.nsf/0/ABD1B841CB387720CA256ECF000CAADE |accessdate=10 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian Social Inclusion Board ===
On 21 May 2008 Vinson was announced as a founding member of the Australian Social Inclusion Board, which brought together leaders from around the country to tackle disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PM announces board |publisher=Australia.to |year=2008 |url=http://www.australia.to/story/0,25197,23040467-075,00,00.html |accessdate=26 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Virginia State University''' ('''VSU'''), also known as '''Virginia State''', is a [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black]] [[Public university|public]] [[land-grant university|land-grant]] university in [[Ettrick, Virginia]]. Founded on {{Start date|1882|03|06}}, Virginia State developed as the [[United States]]'s first fully state-supported four-year institution of higher learning for black Americans. The university is a member school of the [[Thurgood Marshall College Fund]].

==History==
[[File:Virginia State University 2006.jpg|thumb|University entrance]]

Virginia State University was founded on March 6, 1882, when the legislature passed a bill to charter the Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute. The bill was sponsored by Delegate Alfred W. Harris, a black attorney whose offices were in Petersburg, but who lived in and represented Dinwiddie County in the General Assembly. A hostile lawsuit delayed opening day for nineteen months, until October 1, 1883. In 1902, the legislature revised the charter act to curtail the collegiate program and to change the name to Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute. In 1920, the land-grant program for Blacks was moved from a private school, Hampton Institute, where it had been since 1872, to Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute. In 1923 the college program was restored, and the name was changed to Virginia State College for Negroes in 1930. The two-year branch in Norfolk was added to the college in 1944; the Norfolk division became a four-year branch in 1956 and gained independence as Norfolk State College in 1969. Meanwhile, the parent school was renamed Virginia State College in 1946. Finally, the legislature passed a law in 1979 to provide the present name, Virginia State University.

In the first academic year, 1883–84, the University had 126 students and seven faculty (all of them Black), one building, 33 acres, a 200-book library, and a $20,000 budget. By the centennial year of 1982, the University was fully integrated, with a student body of nearly 5,000, a full-time faculty of about 250, a library containing 200,000 books and 360,000 microform and non-print items, a 236-acre campus and 416- acre farm, more than 50 buildings, including 15 dormitories and 16 classroom buildings, and a biennial budget of $31,000,000, exclusive of capital outlay.

The university is situated in Chesterfield County at Ettrick, on a bluff across the Appomattox River from the city of Petersburg. It is accessible via Interstate Highways 95 and 85, which meet in Petersburg. The university is only two and a half hours away from Washington, D.C. to the north, the Raleigh-Durham- Chapel Hill area to the southwest, and Charlottesville to the northwest.

The first person to bear the title of President, John Mercer Langston, was one of the best-known blacks of his day. Until 1992, he was the only black ever elected to the United States Congress from Virginia (elected in 1888), and he was the great-uncle of the famed writer Langston Hughes. From 1888 to 1968, four presidents - James H. Johnston, John M. Gandy, Luther H. Foster, Robert P. Daniel served an average of 20 years, helping the school to overcome adversity and move forward. The next twenty years, 1968-1992, saw six more presidents—James F. Tucker, Wendell P. Russell, Walker H. Quarles, Jr., Thomas M. Law, Wilbert Greenfield, and Wesley Cornelious McClure. On June 1, 1993, Eddie N. Moore, Jr., the former Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Virginia, became the twelfth President of Virginia State University.  Dr. Keith T. Miller became Virginia State University's 13th president from 2010 to 2014.  In 2015, Dr. Pamela V. Hammond became the first woman to lead Virginia State University in 133 years.  She was appointed as interim president on January 1, 2015. On February 1, 2016, President Makola Abdullah, Ph.D., was named as the 14th president of Virginia State University. Dr. Abdullah previously served as provost and senior vice president at Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Fla. President Abdullah is a Chicago native who is the youngest African American to receive a Ph.D. in engineering. He earned his undergraduate degree from Howard University in civil engineering and a Master of Science in civil engineering from Northwestern University.

The '''Youth Challenge Program''' is a program for at-risk youth run by the [[National Guard of the United States]], which consists of Youth Challenge Academies (known as YCA's) in each participating state. The stated mission of the Youth Challenge Program is "to intervene in and reclaim the lives of at-risk youth to produce program graduates with the values, skills, education and self-discipline necessary to succeed as adults." The program accepts 16- to 18-year-old male and female [[high school]] [[Dropping out|dropout]]s who are drug-free and not in trouble with the law.  The program lasts for 17½ months.  The first 5½ months are part of the quasi-military Residential Phase.  The last 12 months are part of the Post-Residential Phase.  Most participants will earn their [[GED]] or a high school diploma by the end of their Residential Phase.

The program is one of many programs administered by the [[National Guard Bureau]] that address leadership, life skills, and physical training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.partnersineducation.com/Content/Default.aspx?pid=9 National Guard Programs and Presentations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508084208/http://www.partnersineducation.com/Content/Default.aspx?pid=9 |date=May 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
