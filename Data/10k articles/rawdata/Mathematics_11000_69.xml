In [[abstract algebra]], '''alternativity''' is a property of a [[binary operation]].  A [[magma (algebra)|magma]] ''G'' is said to be '''left alternative''' if (''xx'')''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''(''xy'') for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''G'' and '''right alternative''' if ''y''(''xx'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''yx'')''x'' for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''G''. A magma that is both left and right alternative is said to be '''alternative'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Any [[associativity|associative]] magma (i.e., a [[semigroup]]) is alternative. More generally, a magma in which every pair of elements generates an associative submagma must be alternative. The converse, however, is not true, in contrast to the situation in [[alternative algebra]]s. In fact, an alternative magma need not even be [[power-associative]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5017">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] theory of [[conformal mapping]]s, the '''area theorem'''
gives an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] satisfied by
the [[power series]] [[coefficient]]s of certain conformal mappings.
The theorem is called by that name, not because of its implications, but rather because the proof uses
the notion of [[area]].

==Statement==
Suppose that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[analytic function|analytic]] and [[injective function|injective]] in the punctured
[[open set|open]] [[unit disk]]
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb D\setminus\{0\}&lt;/math&gt; and has the power series representation
:&lt;math&gt;
f(z)= \frac 1z + \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n,\qquad z\in \mathbb D\setminus\{0\},
&lt;/math&gt;
then the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{n=0}^\infty n|a_n|^2\le 1.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
The idea of the proof is to look at the area uncovered by the image of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.
Define for &lt;math&gt;r\in(0,1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_r(\theta):=f(r\,e^{-i\theta}),\qquad \theta\in[0,2\pi].
&lt;/math&gt;
Then &lt;math&gt;\gamma_r&lt;/math&gt; is a simple closed curve in the plane.
Let &lt;math&gt;D_r&lt;/math&gt; denote the unique bounded connected component of
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb C\setminus\gamma[0,2\pi]&lt;/math&gt;. The existence and
uniqueness of &lt;math&gt;D_r&lt;/math&gt; follows from [[Jordan curve theorem|Jordan's curve theorem]].

If &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is a domain in the plane whose boundary
is a [[Smooth function#Smoothness|smooth]] simple closed curve &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;,
then
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{area}(D)=\int_\gamma x\,dy=-\int_\gamma y\,dx\,,
&lt;/math&gt;
provided that &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is positively [[orientation (topology)|oriented]]
around &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.
This follows easily, for example, from [[Green theorem|Green's theorem]].
As we will soon see, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_r&lt;/math&gt; is positively oriented around
&lt;math&gt;D_r&lt;/math&gt; (and that is the reason for the minus sign in the
definition of &lt;math&gt;\gamma_r&lt;/math&gt;). After applying the [[chain rule]]
and the formula for &lt;math&gt;\gamma_r&lt;/math&gt;, the above expressions for
the area give
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{area}(D_r)= \int_0^{2\pi} \Re\bigl(f(r e^{-i\theta})\bigr)\,\Im\bigl(-i\,r\,e^{-i\theta}\,f'(r e^{-i\theta})\bigr)\,d\theta = -\int_0^{2\pi} \Im\bigl(f(r e^{-i\theta})\bigr)\,\Re\bigl(-i\,r\,e^{-i\theta}\,f'(r e^{-i\theta})\bigr)d\theta.
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the area of &lt;math&gt;D_r&lt;/math&gt; also equals to the average of the two expressions on the right
hand side. After simplification, this yields
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{area}(D_r) = -\frac 12\, \Re\int_0^{2\pi}f(r\,e^{-i\theta})\,\overline{r\,e^{-i\theta}\,f'(r\,e^{-i\theta})}\,d\theta,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\overline z&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[complex conjugation]]. We set &lt;math&gt;a_{-1}=1&lt;/math&gt; and use the power series
expansion for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, to get
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{area}(D_r) = -\frac 12\, \Re\int_0^{2\pi} \sum_{n=-1}^\infty
\sum_{m=-1}^\infty
m\,r^{n+m}\,a_n\,\overline{a_m}\,e^{i\,(m-n)\,\theta}\,d\theta\,.
&lt;/math&gt;
(Since &lt;math&gt;\int_0^{2\pi} \sum_{n=-1}^\infty\sum_{m=-1}^\infty m\,r^{n+m}\,|a_n|\,|a_m|\,d\theta&lt;\infty\,,
&lt;/math&gt; the rearrangement of the terms is justified.)
Now note that &lt;math&gt;\int_0^{2\pi} e^{i\,(m-n)\,\theta}\,d\theta&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;n= m&lt;/math&gt;
and is zero otherwise. Therefore, we get
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{area}(D_r)= -\pi\sum_{n=-1}^\infty n\,r^{2n}\,|a_n|^2.
&lt;/math&gt;
The area of &lt;math&gt;D_r&lt;/math&gt; is clearly positive. Therefore, the right hand side
is positive. Since &lt;math&gt;a_{-1}=1&lt;/math&gt;, by letting &lt;math&gt;r\to1&lt;/math&gt;, the
theorem now follows.

It only remains to justify the claim that &lt;math&gt;\gamma_r&lt;/math&gt; is positively oriented
around &lt;math&gt;D_r&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;r'&lt;/math&gt; satisfy &lt;math&gt;r&lt;r'&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, and set
&lt;math&gt;z_0=f(r')&lt;/math&gt;, say. For very small &lt;math&gt;s&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, we may write the
expression for the [[winding number]] of &lt;math&gt;\gamma_s&lt;/math&gt; around &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt;,
and verify that it is equal to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. Since, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_t&lt;/math&gt; does
not pass through &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;t\ne r'&lt;/math&gt;
(as &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is injective), the invariance
of the winding number under homotopy in the complement of &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt;
implies that the winding number of
&lt;math&gt;\gamma_r&lt;/math&gt; around &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is also &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.
This implies that &lt;math&gt;z_0\in D_r&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;\gamma_r&lt;/math&gt;
is positively oriented around &lt;math&gt;D_r&lt;/math&gt;, as required.

==Uses==
The inequalities satisfied by power series coefficients of conformal
mappings were of considerable interest to mathematicians prior to
the solution of the [[Bieberbach conjecture]]. The area theorem
is a central tool in this context. Moreover, the area theorem is often
used in order to prove the [[Koebe 1/4 theorem]], which is very
useful in the study of the geometry of conformal mappings.

In [[mathematics]],  a '''basis function''' is an element of a particular [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for a [[function space]]. Every continuous function in the function space can be represented as a [[linear combination]] of basis functions, just as every vector in a [[vector space]] can be represented as a linear combination of [[basis vectors]].

In [[numerical analysis]] and [[approximation theory]], basis functions are also called '''blending functions,''' because of their use in [[interpolation]]: In this application, a mixture of the basis functions provides an interpolating function (with the "blend" depending on the evaluation of the basis functions at the data points).

==Examples==

===Polynomial bases===
The base of a polynomial is the factored polynomial equation into a linear function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-08-01|title=Solutions of differential equations in a Bernstein polynomial basis|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377042706003153|journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics|language=en|volume=205|issue=1|pages=272–280|doi=10.1016/j.cam.2006.05.002|issn=0377-0427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourier basis===
Sines and cosines form an ([[orthonormality|orthonormal]]) [[Schauder basis]] for [[square-integrable function]]s. As a particular example, the collection:
:&lt;math&gt;\{\sqrt{2}\sin(2\pi n x) \; | \; n\in\mathbb{N} \} \cup \{\sqrt{2} \cos(2\pi n x) \; | \; n\in\mathbb{N} \} \cup\{1\}&lt;/math&gt;
forms a basis for [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(0,1)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6363">In [[Euclidean geometry]], '''[[Brahmagupta]]'s formula''' is used to find the [[area]] of any [[cyclic quadrilateral]] (one that can be inscribed in a circle) given the lengths of the sides.

== Formula ==
Brahmagupta's formula gives the area {{math|''K''}} of a [[cyclic quadrilateral]] whose sides have lengths {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, {{math|''c''}}, {{math|''d''}} as

: &lt;math&gt;K=\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''s''}}, the [[semiperimeter]], is defined to be

: &lt;math&gt;s=\frac{a+b+c+d}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula generalizes [[Heron's formula]] for the area of a [[triangle]]. A triangle may be regarded as a quadrilateral with one side of length zero. From this perspective, as {{math|''d''}} approaches zero, a cyclic quadrilateral converges into a cyclic triangle (all triangles are cyclic), and Brahmagupta's formula simplifies to Heron's formula.

If the semiperimeter is not used, Brahmagupta's formula is

: &lt;math&gt;K=\frac{1}{4}\sqrt{(-a+b+c+d)(a-b+c+d)(a+b-c+d)(a+b+c-d)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Another equivalent version is

: &lt;math&gt;K=\frac{\sqrt{(a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2)^2+8abcd-2(a^4+b^4+c^4+d^4)}}{4}\cdot&lt;/math&gt;

== Proof ==

===Trigonometric proof===
Here the notations in the figure to the right are used. The area {{math|''K''}} of the cyclic quadrilateral equals the sum of the areas of {{math|△''ADB''}} and {{math|△''BDC''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;= \frac{1}{2}pq\sin A + \frac{1}{2}rs\sin C.&lt;/math&gt;

But since {{math|''ABCD''}} is a cyclic quadrilateral, {{math|∠''DAB'' {{=}} 180° − ∠''DCB''}}. Hence {{math|sin ''A'' {{=}} sin ''C''}}. Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{1}{2}pq\sin A + \frac{1}{2}rs\sin A&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;K^2 = \frac{1}{4} (pq + rs)^2 \sin^2 A&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;4K^2 = (pq + rs)^2 (1 - \cos^2 A) = (pq + rs)^2 - (pq + rs)^2 \cos^2 A.&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for common side {{math|''DB''}}, in {{math|△''ADB''}} and {{math|△''BDC''}}, the [[law of cosines]] gives

:&lt;math&gt;p^2 + q^2 - 2pq\cos A = r^2 + s^2 - 2rs\cos C. &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting {{math|cos ''C'' {{=}} −cos ''A''}} (since angles {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''C''}} are [[Supplementary angles|supplementary]]) and rearranging, we have

:&lt;math&gt;2 (pq + rs) \cos A = p^2 + q^2 - r^2 - s^2. &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this in the equation for the area,

:&lt;math&gt;4K^2 = (pq + rs)^2 - \frac{1}{4}(p^2 + q^2 - r^2 - s^2)^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;16K^2 = 4(pq + rs)^2 - (p^2 + q^2 - r^2 - s^2)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The right-hand side is of the form {{math|''a''{{sup|2}} − ''b''{{sup|2}} {{=}} (''a'' − ''b'')(''a'' + ''b'')}} and hence can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;[2(pq + rs) - p^2 - q^2 + r^2 +s^2][2(pq + rs) + p^2 + q^2 -r^2 - s^2] &lt;/math&gt;

which, upon rearranging the terms in the square brackets, yields

:&lt;math&gt;= [ (r+s)^2 - (p-q)^2 ][ (p+q)^2 - (r-s)^2 ] &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;= (q+r+s-p)(p+r+s-q)(p+q+s-r)(p+q+r-s). &lt;/math&gt;

Introducing the semiperimeter {{math|''S'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''p'' + ''q'' + ''r'' + ''s''|2}}}},

:&lt;math&gt;16K^2 = 16(S-p)(S-q)(S-r)(S-s). &lt;/math&gt;

Taking the square root, we get

:&lt;math&gt;K = \sqrt{(S-p)(S-q)(S-r)(S-s)}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Non-trigonometric proof===
An alternative, non-trigonometric proof utilizes two applications of Heron's triangle area formula on similar triangles.&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Albrecht, "A highway from Heron to Brahmagupta", ''Forum Geometricorum'' 12 (2012), 191–192.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extension to non-cyclic quadrilaterals ==
In the case of non-cyclic quadrilaterals, Brahmagupta's formula can be extended by considering the measures of two opposite angles of the quadrilateral:

: &lt;math&gt;K=\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)-abcd\cos^2\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''θ''}} is half the sum of any two opposite angles. (The choice of which pair of opposite angles is irrelevant: if the other two angles are taken, half their sum is {{math|180° − ''θ''}}. Since {{math|cos(180° − ''θ'') {{=}} −cos ''θ''}}, we have {{math|cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(180° − ''θ'') {{=}} cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''θ''}}.) This more general formula is known as [[Bretschneider's formula]].

It is a property of [[cyclic quadrilateral]]s (and ultimately of [[inscribed angle]]s) that opposite angles of a quadrilateral sum to 180°.  Consequently, in the case of an inscribed quadrilateral, {{math|''θ''}} is 90°, whence the term

:&lt;math&gt;abcd\cos^2\theta=abcd\cos^2 \left(90^\circ\right)=abcd\cdot0=0, &lt;/math&gt;

giving the basic form of Brahmagupta's formula. It follows from the latter equation that the area of a cyclic quadrilateral is the maximum possible area for any quadrilateral with the given side lengths.

A related formula, which was proved by [[Julian Coolidge|Coolidge]], also gives the area of a general convex quadrilateral. It is&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Coolidge, "A Historically Interesting Formula for the Area of a Quadrilateral", ''American Mathematical Monthly'', '''46''' (1939) pp. 345-347.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;K=\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)-\textstyle{1\over4}(ac+bd+pq)(ac+bd-pq)}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}} are the lengths of the diagonals of the quadrilateral. In a [[cyclic quadrilateral]], {{math|''pq'' {{=}} ''ac'' + ''bd''}} according to [[Ptolemy's theorem]], and the formula of Coolidge reduces to Brahmagupta's formula.

{{Redirect|Countable|the linguistic concept|Count noun|the political media company|Countable (app)}}
{{distinguish|text= [[recursively enumerable set|(recursively) enumerable sets]]}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''countable set''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] with the same [[cardinality]] ([[cardinal number|number]] of elements) as some [[subset]] of the set of [[natural number]]s. A countable set is either a [[finite set]] or a '''countably infinite''' set. Whether finite or infinite, the elements of a countable set can always be counted one at a time and, although the counting may never finish, every element of the set is associated with a unique natural number.

Some authors use countable set to mean ''countably infinite'' alone.&lt;ref name="Rudin"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudin|1976|loc=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid this ambiguity, the term ''at most countable'' may be used when finite sets are included and ''countably infinite'', ''enumerable'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kamke|1950|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''denumerable''&lt;ref name="Lang"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lang|1993|loc=&amp;sect;2 of Chapter I}}&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise.

[[Georg Cantor]] introduced the term ''countable set'', contrasting sets that are countable with those that are ''[[uncountable set|uncountable]]'' (i.e., ''nonenumerable'' or ''nondenumerable''&lt;ref name="Apostol"&gt;{{Harvnb|Apostol|1969|loc=Chapter 13.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Today, countable sets form the foundation of a branch of mathematics called ''[[discrete mathematics]]''.

==Definition==
A set {{mvar|S}} is ''countable'' if there exists an [[injective function]] {{mvar|f}} from {{mvar|S}} to the [[natural numbers]] {{math|1='''N''' = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}}}.&lt;ref&gt;Since there is an obvious [[bijection]] between {{math|'''N'''}} and {{math|1='''N'''* = {1, 2, 3, ...}}}, it makes no difference whether one considers 0  a natural number or not. In any case, this article follows [[ISO 31-11]] and the standard convention in [[mathematical logic]], which takes 0 as a natural number.&lt;/ref&gt;

If such an  {{mvar|f}} can be found that is also [[surjective function|surjective]] (and therefore [[bijection|bijective]]), then {{mvar|S}} is called ''countably [[infinite set|infinite]].''

In other words, a set is ''countably infinite'' if it has [[One-one correspondence|one-to-one correspondence]] with the natural number set, {{math|'''N'''}}.

As noted above, this terminology is not universal. Some authors use countable to mean what is here called ''countably infinite,'' and do not include finite sets.

Alternative (equivalent) formulations of the definition in terms of a [[bijective]] function or a [[surjective]] function can also be given. See below.

==History==
In 1874, in [[Georg Cantor's first set theory article|his first set theory article]], Cantor proved that the set of [[real number]]s is uncountable, thus showing that not all infinite sets are countable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Roads to Infinity: The Mathematics of Truth and Proof|first=John C.|last=Stillwell|authorlink=John Stillwell|publisher=CRC Press|year=2010|isbn=9781439865507|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XvPRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10|quote=Cantor's discovery of uncountable sets in 1874 was one of the most unexpected events in the history of mathematics. Before 1874, infinity was not even considered a legitimate mathematical subject by most people, so the need to distinguish between countable and uncountable infinities could not have been imagined.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, he used one-to-one correspondences to define and compare cardinalities.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor 1878, p.&amp;nbsp;242.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, he extended the natural numbers with his infinite [[ordinal number|ordinals]], and used sets of ordinals to produce an infinity of sets having different infinite cardinalities.&lt;ref&gt;Ferreirós 2007, pp. 268, 272&amp;ndash;273.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
A ''[[Set (mathematics)|set]]'' is a collection of ''elements'', and may be described in many ways. One way is simply to list all of its elements; for example, the set consisting of the integers 3, 4, and 5 may be denoted {3, 4, 5}. This is only effective for small sets, however; for larger sets, this would be time-consuming and error-prone. Instead of listing every single element, sometimes an ellipsis ("...") is used, if the writer believes that the reader can easily guess what is missing; for example, {1, 2, 3, ..., 100} presumably denotes the set of [[integer]]s from 1 to 100. Even in this case, however, it is still ''possible'' to list all the elements, because the set is ''finite''.

Some sets are ''infinite''; these sets have more than ''n'' elements for any integer ''n''. For example, the set of natural numbers, denotable by {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}, has infinitely many elements, and we cannot use any normal number to give its size. Nonetheless, it turns out that infinite sets do have a well-defined notion of size (or more properly, of ''cardinality'', which is the technical term for the number of elements in a set), and not all infinite sets have the same cardinality.

[[File:Aplicación 2 inyectiva sobreyectiva02.svg|thumb|x100px|Bijective mapping from integer to even numbers]]
To understand what this means, we first examine what it ''does not'' mean. For example, there are infinitely many odd integers, infinitely many even integers, and (hence) infinitely many integers overall. However, it turns out that the number of even integers, which is the same as the number of odd integers, is also the same as the number of integers overall. This is because we arrange things such that for every integer, there is a distinct even integer: ... −2→−4, −1→−2, 0→0, 1→2, 2→4, ...; or, more generally, ''n''→2''n'', see picture. What we have done here is arranged the integers and the even integers into a ''one-to-one correspondence'' (or ''[[bijection]]''), which is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that maps between two sets such that each element of each set corresponds to a single element in the other set.

However, not all infinite sets have the same cardinality. For example, [[Georg Cantor]] (who introduced this concept) demonstrated that the real numbers cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers (non-negative integers), and therefore that the set of real numbers has a greater cardinality than the set of natural numbers.

A set is ''countable'' if: (1) it is finite, or (2) it has the same cardinality (size) as the set of natural numbers. Equivalently, a set is ''countable'' if it has the same cardinality as some [[subset]] of the set of natural numbers. Otherwise, it is ''uncountable''.

==Formal overview without details==
By definition a set ''S'' is ''countable'' if there exists an [[injective function]] ''f'' : ''S'' → '''N''' from ''S'' to the [[natural numbers]] '''N''' = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.

It might seem natural to divide the sets into different classes: put all the sets containing one element together; all the sets containing two elements together; ...; finally, put together all infinite sets and consider them as having the same size.
This view is not tenable, however, under the natural definition of size.

To elaborate this we need the concept of a [[bijection]]. Although a "bijection" seems a more advanced concept than a number, the usual development of mathematics in terms of set theory defines functions before numbers, as they are based on much simpler sets. This is where the concept of a bijection comes in: define the correspondence

:''a'' ↔ 1, ''b'' ↔ 2, ''c'' ↔ 3

Since every element of {''a'', ''b'', ''c''} is paired with ''precisely one'' element of {1, 2, 3}, ''and'' vice versa, this defines a bijection.

We now generalize this situation and ''define'' two sets as of the same size if (and only if) there is a bijection between them. For all finite sets this gives us the usual definition of "the same size". What does it tell us about the size of infinite sets?

Consider the sets ''A'' = {1, 2, 3, ... }, the set of positive [[integer]]s and ''B'' = {2, 4, 6, ... }, the set of even positive integers. We claim that, under our definition, these sets have the same size, and that therefore ''B'' is countably infinite. Recall that to prove this we need to exhibit a bijection between them. But this is easy, using ''n'' ↔ 2''n'', so that
:1 ↔ 2, 2 ↔ 4, 3 ↔ 6, 4 ↔ 8, ....

As in the earlier example, every element of A has been paired off with precisely one element of B, and vice versa. Hence they have the same size. This is an example of a set of the same size as one of its proper subsets, which is impossible for finite sets.

Likewise, the set of all [[ordered pair]]s of natural numbers is countably infinite, as can be seen by following a path like the one in the picture: [[File:Pairing natural.svg|thumb|300px|The [[Cantor pairing function]] assigns one natural number to each pair of natural numbers]] The resulting mapping is like this:
:0 ↔ (0,0), 1 ↔ (1,0), 2 ↔ (0,1), 3 ↔ (2,0), 4 ↔ (1,1), 5 ↔ (0,2), 6 ↔ (3,0) ....
This mapping covers all such ordered pairs.

If you treat each pair as being the [[numerator]] and [[denominator]] of a [[vulgar fraction]], then for every positive fraction, we can come up with a distinct number corresponding to it. This representation includes also the natural numbers, since every natural number is also a fraction ''N''/1. So we can conclude that there are exactly as many positive rational numbers as there are positive integers. This is true also for all rational numbers, as can be seen below.

'''Theorem:''' The [[Cartesian product]] of finitely many countable sets is countable.

This form of triangular [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] [[recursion|recursively]] generalizes to [[vector space|vectors]] of finitely many natural numbers by repeatedly mapping the first two elements to a natural number. For example, (0,2,3) maps to (5,3), which maps to 39.

Sometimes more than one mapping is useful. This is where you map the set you want to show is countably infinite onto another set—and then map this other set to the natural numbers. For example, the positive [[rational number]]s can easily be mapped to (a subset of) the pairs of natural numbers because ''p''/''q ''maps to (''p'', ''q'').

What about infinite subsets of countably infinite sets? Do these have fewer elements than '''N'''?

'''Theorem:''' Every subset of a countable set is countable. In particular, every infinite subset of a countably infinite set is countably infinite.

For example, the set of [[prime number]]s is countable, by mapping the ''n''-th prime number to ''n'':
*2 maps to 1
*3 maps to 2
*5 maps to 3
*7 maps to 4
*11 maps to 5
*13 maps to 6
*17 maps to 7
*19 maps to 8
*23 maps to 9
*...

What about sets being naturally "larger than" '''N'''? For instance, '''Z''' the set of all [[integer]]s or '''Q''', the set of all [[rational number]]s, which intuitively may seem much bigger than '''N'''. But looks can be deceiving, for we assert:

'''Theorem:''' '''Z''' (the set of all integers) and '''Q''' (the set of all rational numbers) are countable.

In a similar manner, the set of [[algebraic number]]s is countable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kamke|1950|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These facts follow easily from a result that many individuals find non-intuitive.

'''Theorem:''' Any finite [[union (set theory)|union]] of countable sets is countable. 
&lt;!--
'''Q''' can be defined as the set of all fractions ''a''/''b'' where ''a'' and ''b'' are integers and ''b'' &gt; 0. This can be mapped onto the subset of ordered triples of natural numbers (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') such that ''a'' ≥ 0, ''b'' &gt; 0, ''a'' and ''b'' are [[coprime]], and ''c'' ∈ {0, 1} such that ''c'' = 0 if ''a''/''b'' ≥ 0 and ''c'' = 1 otherwise.

*0 maps to (0,1,0)
*1 maps to (1,1,0)
*−1 maps to (1,1,1)
*1/2 maps to (1,2,0)
*−1/2 maps to (1,2,1)
*2 maps to (2,1,0)
*−2 maps to (2,1,1)
*1/3 maps to (1,3,0)
*−1/3 maps to (1,3,1)
*3 maps to (3,1,0)
*−3 maps to (3,1,1)
*1/4 maps to (1,4,0)
*−1/4 maps to (1,4,1)
*2/3 maps to (2,3,0)
*−2/3 maps to (2,3,1)
*3/2 maps to (3,2,0)
*−3/2 maps to (3,2,1)
*4 maps to (4,1,0)
*−4 maps to (4,1,1)
*...
--&gt;

With the foresight of knowing that there are uncountable sets, we can wonder whether or not this last result can be pushed any further. The answer is "yes" and "no", we can extend it, but we need to assume a new axiom to do so.

'''Theorem:''' (Assuming the [[axiom of countable choice]]) The union of countably many countable sets is countable.

For example, given countable sets '''a''', '''b''', '''c''', ...

[[File:Countablepath.svg|thumb|300px|Enumeration for countable number of countable sets]]
Using a variant of the triangular enumeration we saw above:

*''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 0
*''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 1
*''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 2
*''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 3
*''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 4
*''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 5
*''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 6
*''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 7
*''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 8
*''d''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 9
*''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 10
*...

Note that this only works if the sets '''a''', '''b''', '''c''', ... are [[disjoint sets|disjoint]]. If not, then the union is even smaller and is therefore also countable by a previous theorem.

Also note that we need the [[axiom of countable choice]] to index ''all'' the sets '''a''', '''b''', '''c''', ... simultaneously.

'''Theorem:''' The set of all finite-length [[sequence]]s of natural numbers is countable.

This set is the union of the length-1 sequences, the length-2 sequences, the length-3 sequences, each of which is a countable set (finite Cartesian product). So we are talking about a countable union of countable sets, which is countable by the previous theorem.

'''Theorem:''' The set of all finite [[subset]]s of the natural numbers is countable.

If you have a finite subset, you can order the elements into a finite sequence. There are only countably many finite sequences, so also there are only countably many finite subsets.

The following theorem gives equivalent formulations in terms of a bijective function or a [[surjective function]].  A proof of this result can be found in Lang's text.&lt;ref name="Lang"/&gt;

'''(Basic) Theorem:''' Let ''S'' be a set. The following statements are equivalent:
# ''S'' is countable, i.e. there exists an injective function ''f'' : ''S'' → '''N'''.
# Either ''S'' is empty or there exists a surjective function ''g'' : '''N''' → ''S''.  
# Either ''S'' is finite or there exists a [[bijection]] ''h'' : '''N''' → ''S''.

'''Corollary:''' Let ''S'' and ''T'' be sets.
# If the function ''f'' : ''S'' → ''T'' is injective and ''T'' is countable then ''S'' is countable.
# If the function ''g'' : ''S'' → ''T'' is surjective and ''S'' is countable then ''T'' is countable.

'''[[Cantor's theorem]]''' asserts that if ''A'' is a set and ''P''(''A'') is its [[power set]], i.e. the set of all subsets of ''A'', then there is no surjective function from ''A'' to ''P''(''A'').  A proof is given in the article [[Cantor's theorem]].   As an immediate consequence of this and the Basic Theorem above we have:

'''Proposition:''' The set ''P''('''N''') is not countable; i.e. it is [[uncountable]].

For an elaboration of this result see [[Cantor's diagonal argument]].

The set of [[real number]]s is uncountable (see [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]]), and so is the set of all infinite [[sequence]]s of natural numbers.
&lt;!-- WILL RE-INSERT AFTER REORGANIZATION OFSECTION
'''Proof:''' For (1) observe that if ''T'' is countable there is an injective function  ''h'' : ''T'' → '''N'''.  Then if ''f'' : ''S'' → ''T'' is injective the composition ''h'' &lt;small&gt; o &lt;/small&gt; ''f'' : ''S'' → '''N''' is injective, so ''S'' is countable.

For (2) observe that if ''S'' is countable there is a surjective function ''h'' : '''N''' → ''S''.  Then if ''g'' : ''S'' → ''T'' is surjective the composition ''g'' &lt;small&gt; o &lt;/small&gt; ''h'' : '''N''' → ''T'' is surjective, so ''T'' is countable.
--&gt;

==Some technical details==
The proofs of the statements in the above section rely upon the existence of functions with certain properties. This section presents functions commonly used in this role, but not the verifications that these functions have the required properties. The Basic Theorem and its Corollary are often used to simplify proofs. Observe that {{math|'''N'''}} in that theorem can be replaced with any countably infinite set.

'''Proposition:''' Any [[finite set]] is countable.

'''Proof:''' Let {{mvar|S}} be such a set. Two cases are to be considered: Either {{mvar|S}} is empty or it isn't. 1.) The empty set is even itself a subset of the natural numbers, so it is countable. 2.) If {{mvar|S}} is nonempty and finite, then by definition of finiteness there is a bijection between {{mvar|S}} and the set {1, 2, ..., {{mvar|n}}} for some positive natural number {{mvar|n}}. This function is an injection from {{mvar|S}} into {{math|'''N'''}}.

'''Proposition:''' Any subset of a countable set is countable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halmos|1960|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proof:''' The restriction of an injective function to a subset of its [[domain of a function|domain]] is still injective.

'''Proposition:''' If {{mvar|S}} is a countable set then {{math|''S'' ∪ {''x''}}} is countable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Avelsgaard|1990|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proof:''' If {{math|x ∈ S}} there is nothing to be shown. Otherwise let {{math|''f'': ''S'' → '''N'''}} be an injection. Define {{math|''g'': ''S'' ∪ {''x''} → '''N'''}} by {{math|1=''g''(''x'') = 0}} and 
{{math|1=''g''(''y'') = ''f''(''y'') + 1}} for all {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|S}}. This function {{mvar|g}} is an injection.

'''Proposition:''' If {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} are countable sets then {{math|''A'' ∪ ''B''}} is countable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Avelsgaard|1990|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proof:''' Let {{math|''f'': ''A'' → '''N'''}} and {{math|''g'': ''B'' → '''N'''}} be injections. Define a new injection {{math|''h'': ''A'' ∪ ''B'' → '''N'''}} by {{math|1=''h''(''x'') = 2''f''(''x'')}} if {{mvar|x}} is in {{mvar|A}} and {{math|1=''h''(''x'') = 2''g''(''x'') + 1}} if {{mvar|x}} is in {{mvar|B}} but not in {{mvar|A}}.

'''Proposition:'''  The [[Cartesian product]] of two countable sets {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} is countable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halmos|1960|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proof:''' Observe that {{math|'''N''' × '''N'''}} is countable as a consequence of the definition because the function {{math|''f'' : '''N''' × '''N''' → '''N'''}} given by  {{math|1=''f''(''m'', ''n'') = 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;3&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is injective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Avelsgaard|1990|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It then follows from the Basic Theorem and the Corollary that the Cartesian product of any two countable sets is countable. This follows because if {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} are countable there are surjections {{math|''f'' : '''N''' → ''A''}} and {{math|''g'' : '''N''' → ''B''}}. So
:{{math|''f'' × ''g'' : '''N''' × '''N''' → ''A'' × ''B''}}
is a surjection from the countable set {{math|'''N''' × '''N'''}} to the set {{math|''A'' × ''B''}} and the Corollary implies {{math|''A'' × ''B''}} is countable. This result generalizes to the Cartesian product of any finite collection of countable sets and the proof follows by [[mathematical induction|induction]] on the number of sets in the collection.

'''Proposition:''' The [[integers]] {{math|'''Z'''}} are countable and the [[rational numbers]] {{math|'''Q'''}} are countable.

'''Proof:''' The integers {{math|'''Z'''}} are countable because the function {{math|''f'' : '''Z''' → '''N'''}} given by {{math|1=''f''(''n'') = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} if {{mvar|n}} is non-negative and {{math|1=''f''(''n'') = 3&lt;sup&gt;− ''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} if {{mvar|n}} is negative, is an injective function. The rational numbers {{math|'''Q'''}} are countable because the function {{math|''g'' : '''Z''' × '''N''' → '''Q'''}} given by {{math|1=''g''(''m'', ''n'') = ''m''/(''n'' + 1)}} is a surjection from the countable set {{math|'''Z''' × '''N'''}} to the rationals {{math|'''Q'''}}.

'''Proposition:''' The [[algebraic number]]s {{math|'''A'''}} are countable.

'''Proof:''' Per definition, every algebraic number (including complex numbers) is a root of a polynomial with integer coefficients. Given an algebraic number &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;a_0x^0+a_1x^1+a_2x^2+ \cdots + a_nx^n&lt;/math&gt; be a polynomial with integer coefficients such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the ''k''th root of the polynomial, where the roots are sorted by absolute value from small to big, then sorted by argument from small to big. We can define an injection (i. e. one-to-one) function {{math|''f'' : '''A''' → '''Q'''}} given by &lt;math&gt;f(\alpha) = 2^{k-1} \cdot 3^{a_0} \cdot 5^{a_1} \cdot 7^{a_2} \cdots {p_{n+2}}^{a_n}&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; is the ''n''-th [[prime number|prime]].

'''Proposition:''' If {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is a countable set for each {{mvar|n}} in {{math|'''N'''}} then the union of all {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is also countable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|Patty|1988|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proof:''' This is a consequence of the fact that for each {{mvar|n}} there is a surjective function {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' : '''N''' → ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and hence the function
:&lt;math&gt;G : \mathbf{N} \times \mathbf{N} \to \bigcup_{n \in \mathbf{N}} A_n,&lt;/math&gt;

given by {{math|1=''G''(''n'', ''m'') = ''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''m'')}} is a surjection.  Since {{math|'''N''' × '''N'''}} is countable, the Corollary implies that the union is countable. We use the [[axiom of countable choice]] in this proof to pick for each {{mvar|n}} in {{math|'''N'''}} a surjection {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} from the non-empty collection of surjections from {{math|'''N'''}} to {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

A topological proof for the uncountability of the real numbers is described at [[finite intersection property]].

==Minimal model of set theory is countable==
If there is a set that is a standard model (see [[inner model]]) of ZFC set theory, then there is a minimal standard model (''see'' [[Constructible universe]]). The [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] can be used to show that this minimal model is countable. The fact that the notion of "uncountability" makes sense even in this model, and in particular that this model ''M'' contains elements that are:
* subsets of ''M'', hence countable,
* but uncountable from the point of view of ''M'',
was seen as paradoxical in the early days of set theory, see [[Skolem's paradox]].

The minimal standard model includes all the [[algebraic number]]s and all effectively computable [[transcendental number]]s, as well as many other kinds of numbers.

==Total orders==
Countable sets can be [[total order|totally ordered]] in various ways, e.g.:
*[[Well-order]]s (see also [[ordinal number]]):
**The usual order of natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...)
**The integers in the order (0, 1, 2, 3, ...; −1, −2, −3, ...)
*Other (''not'' well orders):
**The usual order of integers (..., −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
**The usual order of rational numbers (Cannot be explicitly written as an ordered list!)

Note that in both examples of well orders here, any subset has a ''least element''; and in both examples of non-well orders, ''some'' subsets do not have a ''least element''.
This is the key definition that determines whether a total order is also a well order.

]]
'''Elementary mathematics'''  consists of [[mathematics]] topics frequently taught at the [[primary school|primary]] or [[secondary school]] levels.

There are five basic strands in Elementary Mathematics: Number Sense and Numeration, Measurement, Geometry &amp; Spatial Sense, Patterning &amp; Algebra, and Data Management &amp; Probability. These five strands are the focus of Mathematics education from grade one till grade 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ontario Curriculum Grades 1-8 Mathematics|last=|first=|publisher=Ontario Ministry of Education|year=2005|isbn=0-7794-8121-6|location=Toronto Ontario|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In secondary school, the main topics in elementary mathematics from grade nine until grade ten are: Number Sense and algebra, Linear Relations, Measurement and Geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ontario Curriculum Grades 9-10 Mathematics|last=|first=|publisher=Ontario Ministry of Education|year=2005|isbn=|location=Toronto, Ontario|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once students enter grade eleven and twelve students begin university and college preparation classes, which include: Functions, Calculus &amp; Vectors, Advanced Functions, and Data Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ontario Curriculum Grades 11-12 Mathematics|last=|first=|publisher=Ontario Ministry of Education|year=2007|isbn=|location=Toronto Ontario|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strands of Elementary Mathematics==
===Number Sense &amp; Numeration ===
Number Sense is an understanding of numbers and operations. In the number sense and numeration strand students develop an understanding of numbers by being taught various ways of representing numbers, as well as the relationships among numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ontario Curriculum Grade 1-8, Mathematics|last=|first=|publisher=Ontario Ministry of Education|year=2005|isbn=0-7794-8121-6|location=Toronto, Ontario|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properties of the natural numbers such as [[divisibility]] and the distribution of [[prime number]]s, are studied in basic [[number theory]], another part of elementary mathematics.

Elementary Focus
*Fractions and Decimals
*Place Value
*Addition and subtraction
*Multiplication and Division
*Counting Money
*Counting
*Representing and ordering numbers
*Estimating 
*Problem Solving 
To have a strong foundation in mathematics and to be able to succeed in the other strands students need to have a fundamental understanding of number sense and numeration.

===Measurement ===
{{main|Measurement}}
Measurement skills and concepts are directly related to the world in which students live. Many of the concepts that students are taught in this strands are also used in other subjects such as science, social studies, and physical education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ontario Curriclum Grades 1-8 Mathematics|last=|first=|publisher=Ontario Ministry of Education|year=2005|isbn=0779481216|location=Toronto Ontario|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the measurement strand students learn about the measurable attributes of objects, in addition to the basic metric system.

Elementary Focus 
* Standard and non-standard units of measurement
* telling time using 12 hour clock and 24 hour clock
* comparing objects using measurable attributes
* measuring height, length, width
* centimetres and metres
* mass and capacity
* temperature change
* days, months, weeks, years
* distances  using kilometres
* measuring kilograms  and litres
* determining area and perimeter
* determining grams and millilitre
* determining measurements using shapes such as triangular prism

The measurement strand consists of multiple forms of measurement as Marian Small states " Measurement is the process of assigning a qualitative or quantitative description of size to an object based on a particular attribute."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making Math Meaningful To Canadian Students, K-8 3rd edition|last=Small|first=Marian|publisher=Nelson Education|year=2017|isbn=978-0-17-658255-5|location=Toronto|page=465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equations and formulas===

A formula is an entity constructed using the symbols and formation rules of a given [[formal language|logical language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Although written in the form of [[proposition (mathematics)|proposition]], an equation is not a [[statement (logic)|statement]] that is either true or false, but a problem consisting of finding the values, called '''solutions''', that, when substituted for the unknowns, yield equal values of the expressions ''A'' and ''B''. For example, 2 is the unique ''solution'' of the ''equation'' ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, in which the ''unknown'' is ''x''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Data representation and analysis===
{{main|Data}}
[[File:Black cherry tree histogram.svg|thumb|An example [[histogram]] of the heights of 31 [[Prunus serotina|Black Cherry]] trees. Histograms are a common tool used to represent data.]]
Data is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[value (computer science)|values]] of [[Qualitative data|qualitative]] or [[Quantitative data|quantitative]] [[variable and attribute (research)|variable]]s; restated, pieces of data are individual pieces of [[information]]. Data in [[computing]] (or [[data processing]]) is represented in a [[structure]] that is often [[tabular]] (represented by [[Row (database)|rows]] and [[Column (database)|columns]]), a [[tree structure|tree]] (a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[node (graph theory)|node]]s with [[parent]]-[[children]] [[relation (database)|relation]]ship), or a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] (a set of [[interconnected|connected]] nodes). Data is typically the result of [[measurement]]s and can be [[data visualisation|visualized]] using [[graph (data structure)|graph]]s or [[image]]s.

Data as an [[Abstraction|abstract]] [[concept]] can be viewed as the lowest level of [[abstraction]], from which [[information]] and then [[knowledge]] are derived.

===Basic two-dimensional geometry===
{{main|Geometry}}
Two-dimensional geometry is a branch of [[mathematics]] concerned with questions of shape, size, and relative position of two-dimensional figures. Basic topics in elementary mathematics include polygons, circles, perimeter and area.

A [[polygon]] that is bounded by a finite chain of straight [[line segment]]s closing in a loop to form a [[Polygonal chain|closed chain]] or ''circuit''. These segments are called its ''edges'' or ''sides'', and the points where two edges meet are the polygon's ''[[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]]'' (singular: vertex) or ''corners''. The interior of the polygon is sometimes called its ''body''. An '''''n''-gon''' is a polygon with ''n'' sides. A polygon is a 2-dimensional example of the more general [[polytope]] in any number of dimensions.

A [[circle]] is a simple [[shape]] of [[Euclidean geometry|two-dimensional geometry]] that is the set of all [[point (geometry)|points]] in a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] that are at a given distance from a given point, the [[Center (geometry)|center]].The distance between any of the points and the center is called the [[radius]]. It can also be defined as the locus of a point equidistant from a fixed point.

A [[perimeter]] is a path that surrounds a [[two-dimensional]] [[shape]]. The term may be used either for the path or its length - it can be thought of as the length of the outline of a shape. The perimeter of a [[circle]] or [[ellipse]] is called its [[circumference]].

[[Area]] is the [[quantity]] that expresses the extent of a [[two-dimensional]] figure or [[shape]]. There are several well-known [[formula]]s for the areas of simple shapes such as [[triangle]]s, [[rectangle]]s, and [[circle]]s.

===Proportions===
{{main|Proportionality (mathematics)}}
Two quantities are proportional if a change in one is always accompanied by a change in the other, and if the changes are always related by use of a constant multiplier. The constant is called the [[coefficient]] of proportionality or '''proportionality constant'''.

*If one quantity is always [[wiktionary:product#|the product]] of the other and a constant, the two are said to be ''directly proportional''. {{nobr|''x'' and ''y''}} are directly proportional if the [[ratio]] &lt;math&gt;\tfrac yx&lt;/math&gt; is constant.
*If the product of the two quantities is always equal to a constant, the two are said to be ''inversely proportional''. {{nobr|''x'' and ''y''}} are inversely proportional if the product &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; is constant.

===Analytic geometry===
{{main|Analytic geometry}}
[[File:Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg|thumb|250px|Cartesian coordinates]]
[[Analytic geometry]] is the study of [[geometry]] using a [[coordinate system]]. This contrasts with [[synthetic geometry]].

Usually the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] is applied to manipulate [[equation]]s for [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]s, [[Line (geometry)|straight line]]s, and [[Square (geometry)|square]]s, often in two and sometimes in three dimensions. Geometrically, one studies the [[Euclidean plane]] (2 dimensions) and [[Euclidean space]] (3 dimensions). As taught in school books, analytic geometry can be explained more simply: it is concerned with defining and representing geometrical shapes in a numerical way and extracting numerical information from shapes' numerical definitions and representations.

Transformations are ways of shifting and scaling functions using different algebraic formulas.

===Negative numbers===
{{main|Negative number}}
A [[negative number]] is a [[real number]] that is [[inequality (mathematics)|less than]] [[0 (number)|zero]].  Such numbers are often used to represent the amount  of a loss or absence.  For example, a [[debt]] that is owed may be thought of as a negative asset, or a decrease in some quantity may be thought of as a negative increase.  Negative numbers are used to describe values on a scale that goes below zero, such as the Celsius and [[Fahrenheit]] scales for temperature.

===Exponents and radicals===
{{main|Exponentiation|Nth root}}
Exponentiation is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[operation (mathematics)|operation]], written as '''''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''', involving two numbers, the '''[[Base (exponentiation)|base]]''' ''b'' and the '''exponent''' (or '''power''') ''n''. When ''n'' is a [[natural number]] (i.e., a positive [[integer]]), exponentiation corresponds to repeated [[multiplication]] of the base: that is, ''b&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of multiplying ''n'' bases:

:&lt;math&gt;b^n = \underbrace{b \times \cdots \times b}_n&lt;/math&gt;

Roots are the opposite of exponents. The [[nth root]] of a [[number]] ''x'' (written &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{x}&lt;/math&gt;) is a number ''r'' which when raised to the power ''n'' yields&amp;nbsp;''x''. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{x} = r \iff r^n  =  x,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n'' is the ''degree'' of the root. A root of degree 2 is called a ''[[square root]]'' and a root of degree 3, a ''[[cube root]]''. Roots of higher degree are referred to by using ordinal numbers, as in ''fourth root'', ''twentieth root'', etc.

For example:
* 2 is a square root of 4, since 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4.
* −2 is also a square root of 4, since (−2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4.

===Compass-and-straightedge===
{{main|compass-and-straightedge construction}}
Compass-and-straightedge, also known as ruler-and-compass construction, is the construction of lengths, [[angle]]s, and other geometric figures using only an [[Idealization (science philosophy)|idealized]] [[ruler]] and [[Compass (drafting)|compass]].

The idealized ruler, known as a [[straightedge]], is assumed to be infinite in length, and has no markings on it and only one edge. The compass is assumed to collapse when lifted from the page, so may not be directly used to transfer distances. (This is an unimportant restriction since, using a multi-step procedure, a distance can be transferred even with collapsing compass, see [[compass equivalence theorem]].) More formally, the only permissible constructions are those granted by [[Euclid]]'s first three postulates.

===Congruence and similarity===
{{main|Congruence (geometry)|Similarity (geometry)}}
Two figures or objects are congruent if they have the same [[shape]] and size, or if one has the same shape and size as the mirror image of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cortland.edu/matresearch/OxfordDictionaryMathematics.pdf |title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Mathematics, Congruent Figures |first1=C. |last1=Clapham |first2=J. |last2=Nicholson |publisher=Addison-Wesley |year=2009 |page=167 |accessdate=September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203826/http://web.cortland.edu/matresearch/OxfordDictionaryMathematics.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; More formally, two sets of  [[point (geometry)|points]] are called '''congruent''' if, and only if, one can be transformed into the other by an [[isometry]], i.e., a combination of '''rigid motions''', namely a [[translation (geometry)|translation]], a [[rotation]], and a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]. This means that either object can be repositioned and reflected (but not resized) so as to coincide precisely with the other object. So two distinct plane figures on a piece of paper are congruent if we can cut them out and then match them up completely. Turning the paper over is permitted.

Two geometrical objects are called [[similarity (geometry)|similar]] if they both have the same [[shape]], or one has the same shape as the mirror image of the other.  More precisely, one can be obtained from the other by uniformly [[Scaling (geometry)|scaling]] (enlarging or shrinking), possibly with additional [[Translation (geometry)|translation]], [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]. This means that either object can be rescaled, repositioned, and reflected, so as to coincide precisely with the other object. If two objects are similar, each is [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to the result of a uniform scaling of the other.

===Three-dimensional geometry===
{{main|Solid geometry}}
[[Solid geometry]] was the traditional name for the [[geometry]] of three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. '''Stereometry''' deals with the [[measurement]]s of [[volume]]s of various '''solid figures''' ([[three-dimensional]] figures) including [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramids]], [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinders]], [[cone (geometry)|cones]], [[Frustum|truncated cones]], [[sphere]]s, and [[Prism (geometry)|prisms]].

===Rational numbers===
{{main|Rational number}}
[[Rational number]] is any [[number]] that can be expressed as the [[quotient]] or fraction ''p''/''q'' of two [[integer]]s, with the [[denominator]] ''q'' not equal to zero.&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosen |first=Kenneth |year=2007 |title=Discrete Mathematics and its Applications |edition=6th |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-07-288008-3 |pages=105, 158–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since ''q'' may be equal to&amp;nbsp;1, every integer is a rational number. The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all rational numbers is usually denoted by a boldface '''Q''' (or [[blackboard bold]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;).

===Patterns, relations and functions===
{{main|Pattern|Relation (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)}}
A [[pattern]] is a discernible regularity in the world or in a manmade design. As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner. A '''geometric pattern''' is a kind of pattern formed of geometric shapes and typically repeating like a [[wallpaper]].

A [[binary relation|relation]]  on a [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'' is a collection of [[ordered pair]]s of elements of ''A''. In other words, it is a [[subset]] of the [[Cartesian product]] ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = {{nowrap|''A'' × ''A''}}. Common relations include divisibility between two numbers and inequalities.

A '''function'''&lt;ref&gt;The words '''map''' or '''mapping''', '''[[Transformation (function)|transformation]]''', '''correspondence''', and '''operator''' are often used synonymously. {{harvnb |Halmos |1970 |p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[binary relation|relation]] between a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of inputs and a set of permissible outputs with the property that each input is related to exactly one output. An example is the function that relates each real number ''x'' to its square ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The output of a function ''f'' corresponding to an input ''x'' is denoted by ''f''(''x'') (read "''f'' of ''x''"). In this example, if the input is &amp;minus;3, then the output is 9, and we may write ''f''(&amp;minus;3) = 9. The input variable(s) are sometimes referred to as the argument(s) of the function.

===Slopes and trigonometry===
{{main|Slope of a line|Trigonometry}}
The [[slope of a line]] is a number that describes both the ''direction'' and the ''steepness'' of the line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cortland.edu/matresearch/OxfordDictionaryMathematics.pdf |title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Mathematics, Gradient |first1=C. |last1=Clapham |first2=J. |last2=Nicholson |publisher=Addison-Wesley |year=2009 |page=348 |accessdate=September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203826/http://web.cortland.edu/matresearch/OxfordDictionaryMathematics.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slope is often denoted by the letter ''m''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=Slope|publisher=MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Slope.html|accessdate=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trigonometry]]  is a branch of [[mathematics]] that studies relationships involving lengths and [[angle]]s of [[triangle]]s.  The field emerged during the 3rd century BC from applications of [[geometry]] to astronomical studies.&lt;ref&gt;R. Nagel (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Science'', 2nd Ed., The Gale Group (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the [[United States]], there has been considerable concern about the low level of elementary mathematics skills on the part of many students, as compared to students in other developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;Liping Ma, ''Knowing and Teaching Elementary Mathematics: Teachers' Understanding of Fundamental Mathematics in China and the United States (Studies in Mathematical Thinking and Learning.)'', Lawrence Erlbaum, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-8058-2909-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[No Child Left Behind]] program was one attempt to address this deficiency, requiring that all American students be tested in elementary mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick M. Hess and Michael J. Petrilli, ''No Child Left Behind'', Peter Lang Publishing, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-8204-7844-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evolving Networks''' are [[complex networks|networks]] that change as a function of time. They are a natural extension of [[network science]] since almost all real world networks evolve over time, either by adding or removing [[Vertex (graph theory)|nodes]] or links over time. Often all of these processes occur simultaneously, such as in [[social networks]] where people make and lose friends over time, thereby creating and destroying edges, and some people become part of new social networks or leave their networks, changing the nodes in the network. Evolving network concepts build on established [[network theory]] and are now being introduced into studying networks in many diverse fields.

==Network theory background==
The study of networks traces its foundations to the development of [[graph theory]], which was first analyzed by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1736 when he wrote the famous [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]] paper. Probabilistic network theory then developed with the help of eight famous papers studying [[random graphs]] written by [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Alfréd Rényi]]. The [[Erdős-Rényi model]] (ER) supposes that a graph is composed of '''N''' labeled nodes where each pair of nodes is connected by a preset probability '''p'''.

[[Image:Watts strogatz.svg|thumb|Watts-Strogatz graph]]
While the ER model's simplicity has helped it find many applications, it does not accurately describe many real world networks. The ER model fails to generate local clustering and [[triadic closure]]s as often as they are found in real world networks.  Therefore, the [[Watts and Strogatz model]] was proposed, whereby a network is constructed as a regular ring lattice, and then nodes are rewired according to some probability '''β'''.&lt;ref name=WS&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This produces a locally clustered network and dramatically reduces the [[average path length]], creating networks which represent the [[Small-world networks|small world phenomenon]] observed in many real world networks.&lt;ref name=milg&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Travers Jeffrey |author2=Milgram Stanley | year = 1969 | title = An Experimental Study of the Small World Problem | url = | journal = Sociometry | volume = 32 | issue = 4| pages = 425–443 | doi=10.2307/2786545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this achievement, both the ER and the Watts and Storgatz models fail to account for the formulation of hubs as observed in many real world networks. The degree distribution in the ER model follows a [[Poisson distribution]], while the Watts and Strogatz model produces graphs that are [[homogeneous]] in [[degree distribution|degree]]. Many networks are instead scale free, meaning that their degree distribution follows a [[power law]] of the form:

: &lt;math&gt;P\left(k\right)\sim k^{-\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

This exponent turns out to be approximately 3 for many real world networks, however, it is not a universal constant and depends continuously on the network's parameters &lt;ref name=Barabasi2000&gt;{{Cite journal

==First evolving network model - scale free networks==
{{Main| Barabási–Albert model }}

The Barabási–Albert (BA) model was the first widely accepted model to produce [[scale-free networks]]. This was accomplished by incorporating [[preferential attachment]] and growth, where nodes are added to the network over time and are more likely to link to other nodes with high degree distributions. The BA model was first applied to degree distributions on the web, where both of these effects can be clearly seen. New web pages are added over time, and each new page is more likely to link to highly visible hubs like [[Google]] which have high degree distributions than to nodes with only a few links. Formally this preferential attachment is:

: &lt;math&gt;p_i = \frac{k_i}{\displaystyle\sum_j k_j},&lt;/math&gt;

==Additions to BA model==
The BA model was the first model to derive the network topology from the way the network was constructed with nodes and links being added over time. However, the model makes only the simplest assumptions necessary for a scale-free network to emerge, namely that there is linear growth and linear preferential attachment. This minimal model does not capture variations in the shape of the degree distribution, variations in the degree exponent, or the size independent [[clustering coefficient]]. 
Therefore, the original model has since been modified{{by whom?|date=June 2016}} to more fully capture the properties of evolving networks by introducing a few new properties.

===Fitness===
{{Main|Fitness model (network theory)}}

One concern with the BA model is that the degree distributions of each nodes experience strong [[positive feedback]] whereby the earliest nodes with high degree distributions continue to dominate the network indefinitely. However, this can be alleviated by introducing a fitness for each node, which modifies the probability of new links being created with that node or even of links to that node being removed.&lt;ref&gt;
Albert R. and Barabási A.-L., "Statistical mechanics of complex networks", ''Reviews of Modern Physics'' 74, 47 (2002)
&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to preserve the preferential attachment from the BA model, this fitness is then multiplied by the preferential attachment based on degree distribution to give the true probability that a link is created which connects to node ''i''.

: &lt;math&gt;\Pi(k_i) = \frac{\eta_i k_i}{\displaystyle\sum_j \eta_j k_j},&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the fitness, which may also depend on time. A decay of fitness with respect to time may occur and can be formalized by:

&lt;math&gt; \Pi(k_i) \propto k_i(t-t_i)^{-\nu},&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; increases with  &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;

===Removing nodes and rewiring links===
Further complications arise because nodes may be removed from the network with some probability. Additionally, existing links may be destroyed and new links between existing nodes may be created. The probability of these actions occurring may depend on time and may also be related to the node's fitness. Probabilities can be assigned to these events by studying the characteristics of the network in question in order to grow a model network with identical properties. This growth would take place with one of the following actions occurring at each time step:

Prob p: add an internal link.

Prob q: delete a link.

Prob r: delete a node.

Prob 1-p-q-r: add a node.

==Other ways of characterizing evolving networks==
In addition to growing network models as described above, there may be times when other methods are more useful or convenient for characterizing certain properties of evolving networks.

===Convergence towards Equilibria===

In networked systems where competitive decision making takes place, game theory is often used to model system dynamics, and convergence towards equilibria can be considered as a driver of topological evolution.  For example,  Kasthurirathna and Piraveenan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |last1=Kasthurirathna|first1=Dharshana 
 |last2=Piraveenan |first2=Mahendra.
 |title=Emergence of scale-free characteristics in socioecological systems with bounded rationality
 |journal=[[Scientific Reports (journal)|Scientific Reports]]
 |volume=In Press |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that when individuals in a system display varying levels of rationality, improving the overall system rationality might be an evolutionary reason for the emergence of scale-free networks. They demonstrated this by applying evolutionary pressure on an initially random network which simulates a range of classic games, so that the network converges towards Nash equilibria while being allowed to re-wire. The networks become increasingly scale-free during this process.

===Treat evolving networks as successive snapshots of a static network===
The most common way to view evolving networks is by considering them as successive static networks. This could be conceptualized as the individual still images which compose a [[video|motion picture]]. Many simple parameters exist to describe a static network (number of nodes, edges, path length, connected components), or to describe specific nodes in the graph such as the number of links or the clustering coefficient. These properties can then individually be studied as a time series using signal processing notions.&lt;ref name=EvolvingNetworksPDF&gt;{{Cite journal
| url = http://liris.cnrs.fr/Documents/Liris-3669.pdf
 | author1 = Pierre Borgnat
 | author2 = Eric Fleury
 | title = Evolving Networks
|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, we can track the number of links established to a server per minute by looking at the successive snapshots of the network and counting these links in each snapshot.

Unfortunately, the analogy of snapshots to a motion picture also reveals the main difficulty with this approach: the time steps employed are very rarely suggested by the network and are instead arbitrary. Using extremely small time steps between each snapshot preserves resolution, but may actually obscure wider trends which only become visible over longer timescales. Conversely, using larger timescales loses the temporal order of events within each snapshot. Therefore, it may be difficult to find the appropriate timescale for dividing the evolution of a network into static snapshots.

===Define dynamic properties===
It may be important to look at properties which cannot be directly observed by treating evolving networks as a sequence of snapshots, such as the duration of contacts between nodes&lt;ref name="Impact of human mobility on the
 design of opportunistic forwarding algorithms"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar properties can be defined and then it is possible to instead track these properties through the evolution of a network and visualize them directly.

Another issue with using successive snapshots is that only slight changes in network topology can have large effects on the outcome of algorithms designed to find communities. Therefore, it is necessary to use a non classical definition of communities which permits following the evolution of the community through a set of rules such as birth, death, merge, split, growth, and contraction.&lt;ref name="Quantifying social group evolution"&gt;{{Cite journal

Real evolving networks which are currently being studied include [[social networks]], [[telecommunications network|communications networks]], the [[internet]], the [[Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon|movie actor network]], the [[world wide web]], and [[Transport network|transportation network]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34741">In [[software]], '''find first set''' ('''ffs''') or '''find first one''' is a [[bit operation]] that, given an unsigned [[Word (computer architecture)|machine word]], identifies the least significant index or position of the bit set to one in the word. A nearly equivalent operation is '''count trailing zeros''' ('''ctz''') or '''number of trailing zeros''' ('''ntz'''), which counts the number of zero bits following the least significant one bit. The complementary operation that finds the index or position of the most significant set bit is ''log base 2'', so called because it computes the [[binary logarithm]] &lt;math&gt;\lfloor \log_2 x\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, [http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#IntegerLogObvious Find the log base 2 of an integer with the MSB N set in O(N) operations (the obvious way)]&lt;/ref&gt; This is [[#Properties and relations|closely related]] to '''count leading zeros''' ('''clz''') or '''number of leading zeros''' ('''nlz'''), which counts the number of zero bits preceding the most significant one bit. These four operations also have negated versions:
* '''find first zero''' ('''ffz'''), which identifies the index of the least significant zero bit;
* '''count trailing ones''', which counts the number of one bits following the least significant zero bit.
* '''count leading ones''', which counts the number of one bits preceding the most significant zero bit;
* The operation that finds the index of the most significant zero bit, which is a rounded version of the [[binary logarithm]].
There are two common variants of find first set, the POSIX definition which starts indexing of bits at 1,&lt;ref name="ffsmanpage"&gt;{{cite web|title=FFS(3)|url=https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man3/ffs.3.html|work=Linux Programmer's Manual|publisher=The Linux Kernel Archives|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; herein labelled ffs, and the variant which starts indexing of bits at zero, which is equivalent to ctz and so will be called by that name.

== Examples ==
Given the following 32-bit word:
 00000000000000001000000000001000
The count trailing zeros operation would return 3, while the count leading zeros operation returns 16. The count leading zeros operation depends on the word size: if this 32-bit word were truncated to a 16-bit word, count leading zeros would return zero. The find first set operation would return 4, indicating the 4th position from the right. The log base 2 is 15.

Similarly, given the following 32-bit word, the bitwise negation of the above word:
 11111111111111110111111111110111
The count trailing ones operation would return 3, the count leading ones operation would return 16, and the find first zero operation ffz would return 4.

If the word is zero (no bits set), count leading zeros and count trailing zeros both return the number of bits in the word, while ffs returns zero. Both log base 2 and zero-based implementations of find first set generally return an undefined result for the zero word.

== Hardware support ==
Many architectures include [[instruction set|instructions]] to rapidly perform find first set and/or related operations, listed below. The most common operation is count leading zeros (clz), likely because all other operations can be implemented efficiently in terms of it (see [[#Properties and relations|Properties and relations]]).

== Properties and relations ==
If bits are labeled starting at 1 (which is the convention used in this article), then count trailing zeros and find first set operations are related by {{math|1=ctz(''x'') = ffs(''x'') − 1}} (except when the input is zero).  If bits are labeled starting at 0, then count trailing zeros and find first set are exactly equivalent operations.

Given w bits per word, the log base 2 is easily computed from the clz and vice versa by {{math|1=lg(''x'') = ''w'' − 1 − clz(''x'')}}.

As demonstrated in the example above, the find first zero, count leading ones, and count trailing ones operations can be implemented by negating the input and using find first set, count leading zeros, and count trailing zeros. The reverse is also true.

On platforms with an efficient log base 2 operation such as M68000, ctz can be computed by:
:ctz(x) = lg(x &amp; (−x))
where "&amp;" denotes bitwise AND and "−x" denotes the negative of x treating x as a signed integer in [[two's complement]] arithmetic. The expression x &amp; (−x) clears all but the least-significant 1 bit, so that the most- and least-significant 1 bit are the same.

On platforms with an efficient count leading zeros operation such as ARM and PowerPC, ffs can be computed by:
:ffs(x) = w − clz(x &amp; (−x)).

Conversely, clz can be computed using ctz by first rounding up to the nearest power of two using shifts and bitwise ORs,&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, [http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#RoundUpPowerOf2 Round up to the next highest power of 2].&lt;/ref&gt; as in this 32-bit example (note that this example depends on ctz returning 32 for the zero input):
 '''function''' clz(x):
     '''for each''' y '''in''' {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}: x ← x | (x &gt;&gt; y)
     '''return''' 32 − ctz(x + 1)

On platforms with an efficient [[Hamming weight]] (population count) operation such as [[SPARC]]'s &lt;code&gt;POPC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name="SPARC_1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Warren_2013"/&gt; or [[Blackfin]]'s &lt;code&gt;ONES&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;ref name="AD_2001"/&gt; ctz can be computed using the identity:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dietz|first=Henry Gordon|title=The Aggregate Magic Algorithms|url=http://aggregate.org/MAGIC/#Trailing%20Zero%20Count|publisher=University of Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author-first=Gerd|author-last=Isenberg|title=BitScanProtected|url=http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/BitScan#Bitscan forward-Index of LS1B by Popcount|work=Chess Programming Wiki|accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:ctz(x) = pop((x &amp; (−x)) − 1),
ffs can be computed using:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=SPARC International, Inc.|title=The SPARC architecture manual : version 8|year=1992|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|isbn=0-13-825001-4|pages=231|url=http://www.sparc.org/standards/SPARCV9.pdf|edition=Version 8.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118213535/http://www.sparc.org/standards/SPARCV9.pdf|archivedate=2012-01-18|df=}} A.41: Population Count. Programming Note.&lt;/ref&gt;
:ffs(x) = pop(x ^ (~(−x)))
where "^" denotes bitwise xor, and clz can be computed by:
 '''function''' clz(x):
     '''for each''' y '''in''' {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}: x ← x | (x &gt;&gt; y)
     '''return''' 32 − pop(x)

The inverse problem (given i, produce an x such that ctz(x)=i) can be computed with a left-shift (1 &lt;&lt; i).

Find first set and related operations can be extended to arbitrarily large [[bit array]]s in a straightforward manner by starting at one end and proceeding until a word that is not all-zero (for ffs/ctz/clz) or not all-one (for ffz/clo/cto) is encountered. A tree data structure that recursively uses bitmaps to track which words are nonzero can accelerate this.

==Algorithms==

===FFS===
Find first set can also be implemented in software. A simple loop implementation:

 '''function''' ffs (x)
     '''if''' x = 0 '''return''' 0
     t ← 1
     r ← 1
     '''while''' (x &amp; t) = 0
         t ← t &lt;&lt; 1
         r ← r + 1
     '''return''' r

where "&lt;&lt;" denotes left-shift. Similar loops can be used to implement all the related operations. On modern architectures this loop is inefficient due to a large number of conditional branches. A lookup table can eliminate most of these:

 table[0..2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;-1] = ffs(i) '''for''' i '''in''' 0..2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;-1
 '''function''' ffs_table (x)
     '''if''' x = 0 '''return''' 0
     r ← 0
     '''loop'''
         '''if''' (x &amp; (2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;-1)) ≠ 0
             '''return''' r + table[x &amp; (2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;-1)]
         x ← x &gt;&gt; n
         r ← r + n

The parameter ''n'' is fixed (typically 8) and represents a [[time–space tradeoff]]. The loop may also be fully [[loop unrolling|unrolled]].

===CTZ===
Count Trailing Zeros (ctz) counts the number of zero bits succeeding the least significant one bit.  For example, the ctz of 0x00000F00 is 8, and the ctz of 0x80000000 is 31.

An algorithm for 32-bit ctz by Leiserson, Prokop, and Randall uses [[de Bruijn sequence]]s to construct a [[minimal perfect hash function]] that eliminates all branches:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

This algorithm requires a CPU with a 32-bit multiply instruction with a 64-bit result.  The 32-bit multiply instruction in the low-cost [[ARM Cortex-M0]] / M0+ / M1 cores have a 32-bit result, though other [[ARM architecture|ARM]] cores have another multiply instruction with a 64-bit result.&lt;ref name="M0-TRM"&gt;[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0432c/DDI0432C_cortex_m0_r0p0_trm.pdf Cortex-M0 r0p0 Technical Reference Manual; ARM Holdings.]&lt;/ref&gt;

 table[0..31] initialized by: '''for''' i '''from''' 0 '''to''' 31: table[ ( 0x077CB531 * ( 1 &lt;&lt; i ) ) &gt;&gt; 27 ] ← i
 '''function''' ctz_debruijn (x)
     '''return''' table[((x &amp; (-x)) * 0x077CB531) &gt;&gt; 27]

The expression (x &amp; (-x)) again isolates the least-significant 1 bit. There are then only 32 possible words, which the unsigned multiplication and shift hash to the correct position in the table. (Note: this algorithm does not handle the zero input.) A similar algorithm works for log base 2, but rather than isolate the most-significant bit, it rounds up to the nearest integer of the form 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;minus;1 using shifts and bitwise ORs:&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, [http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#IntegerLogDeBruijn Find the log base 2 of an N-bit integer in O(lg(N)) operations with multiply and lookup]&lt;/ref&gt;

     '''if''' (x &amp; 0x00000001) = 0: n ← n +  1
     '''return''' n

===CLZ===
Count Leading Zeros (clz) counts the number of zero bits preceding the most significant one bit.  For example, the clz of 0x00000F00 is 20, and the clz of 0x00000001 is 31.

Just as count leading zeros is useful for software [[floating point]] implementations, conversely, on platforms that provide hardware conversion of integers to floating point, the exponent field can be extracted and subtracted from a constant to compute the count of leading zeros. Corrections are needed to account for rounding errors.&lt;ref name="hackersdelight-clz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, [http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#IntegerLogIEEE64Float Find the integer log base 2 of an integer with an 64-bit IEEE float].&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[C (programming language)|C language]] examples require a header file for the definition of uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t.  It is stated here instead of repeating in each code example.

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
/* uint8_t is a 8-bit unsigned integer, uint16_t is a 16-bit unsigned integer, uint32_t is a 32-bit unsigned integer */
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt; /* exists in C99 compatible C/C++ compilers */
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;!-- NOTE: This code was posted by User:Sbmeirow --&gt;

The non-optimized approach examines one bit at a time until a non-zero bit is found, as shown in this [[C (programming language)|C language]] example, and slowest with an input value of 1 because of the many loops it has to perform to find it.

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int clz1( uint32_t x )
{
  int n;
  if (x == 0) return 32;
  for (n = 0; ((x &amp; 0x80000000) == 0); n++, x &lt;&lt;= 1);
  return n;
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;!-- NOTE: This code was posted by User:Sbmeirow --&gt;

An evolution of the previous looping approach examines four bits at a time then using a lookup table for the final four bits, which is shown here.  A faster looping approach would examine eight bits at a time and increasing to a 256 entry lookup table.

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
static const uint8_t clz_table_4bit[16] = { 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
int clz2( uint32_t x )
{
  int n;
  if (x == 0) return 32;
  for (n = 0; ((x &amp; 0xF0000000) == 0); n += 4, x &lt;&lt;= 4);
  n += (int)clz_table_4bit[x &gt;&gt; (32-4)];
  return n;
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;!-- NOTE: This code was posted by User:Sbmeirow --&gt;

Faster than the looping method is a [[binary search]] implementation which takes a logarithmic number of operations and branches, as in these 32-bit versions:&lt;ref name="hackersdelight-clz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hackersdelight-ctz"/&gt;

 '''function''' clz3(x)
     '''if''' x = 0 '''return''' 32
     n ← 0
     '''if''' (x &amp; 0xFFFF0000) = 0: n ← n + 16, x ← x &lt;&lt; 16
     '''if''' (x &amp; 0xFF000000) = 0: n ← n +  8, x ← x &lt;&lt;  8
     '''if''' (x &amp; 0xF0000000) = 0: n ← n +  4, x ← x &lt;&lt;  4
     '''if''' (x &amp; 0xC0000000) = 0: n ← n +  2, x ← x &lt;&lt;  2
     '''if''' (x &amp; 0x80000000) = 0: n ← n +  1
     '''return''' n

The binary search algorithm can be assisted by a table as well, replacing the bottom two "if" statements with a 16 entry lookup table using the final nibble (4-bits) as an index, which is shown here.  An alternate approach replaces the bottom three "if" statements with a 256 entry lookup table using the final byte (8-bits) as an index.  In both of these methods, the initial check for zero is removed because the final table operation takes care of it.

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
static const uint8_t clz_table_4bit[16] = { 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
int clz4( uint32_t x )
{
  int n;
  if ((x &amp; 0xFFFF0000) == 0) {n  = 16; x &lt;&lt;= 16;} else {n = 0;}
  if ((x &amp; 0xFF000000) == 0) {n +=  8; x &lt;&lt;=  8;}
  if ((x &amp; 0xF0000000) == 0) {n +=  4; x &lt;&lt;=  4;}
  n += (int)clz_table_4bit[x &gt;&gt; (32-4)];
  return n;
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;!-- NOTE: This code was posted by User:Sbmeirow --&gt;

The fastest practical approach to simulate clz uses a precomputed 64KB lookup table, as shown in this [[C (programming language)|C language]] example.

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
/* The table MUST be calculated before calling this function */
static uint8_t clz_table_16bit[65536];
int clz5( uint32_t x )
{
  if ((x &amp; 0xFFFF0000) == 0)
    return (int)clz_table_16bit[x] + 16;
  else
    return (int)clz_table_16bit[x &gt;&gt; 16];
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;!-- NOTE: This code was posted by User:Sbmeirow --&gt;

Other than a dedicated assembly instruction that performs the CLZ type operation, the fastest method to compute CLZ is reading a pre-computed value from a lookup table.  A 4-bit lookup table, clz_table_4bit[16], is used in above examples.  The following are C language examples of CLZ for a 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit input value.  The tables must be pre-computed by functions not shown here.  An alternate 8-bit approach could pack two results in each table entry thus needing a 128 entry table instead of 256 entry table, because the bit count is 0 to 8 which fits in a 4-bit nibble.

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
/* Note: Tables MUST be calculated before calling each function or macro that reads from it */

uint8_t clz_table_8bit[256];
int clz8f( uint8_t x )
{
  return (int)clz_table_8bit[x];
}
#define clz8d(x) (clz_table_8bit[x])

uint8_t clz_table_16bit[65536];
int clz16f( uint16_t x )
{
  return (int)clz_table_16bit[x];
}
#define clz16d(x) (clz_table_16bit[x])

uint8_t clz_table_32bit[4294967296]; /* conceptual, but 4GB array is not practical */
int clz32f( uint32_t x )
{
  return (int)clz_table_32bit[x];
}
#define clz32d(x) (clz_table_32bit[x])

&lt;/source&gt;&lt;!-- NOTE: This code was posted by User:Sbmeirow --&gt;

==Applications==
The count leading zeros (clz) operation can be used to efficiently implement ''normalization'', which encodes an integer as ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''e''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''m'' has its most significant bit in a known position (such as the highest position). This can in turn be used to implement [[Newton-Raphson division]], perform integer to [[floating point]] conversion in software, and other applications.&lt;ref name="hackersdelight-clz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sloss|first=Andrew N.|last2=Symes|first2=Dominic|last3=Wright|first3=Chris|title=ARM system developer's guide designing and optimizing system software|year=2004|publisher=[[Morgan Kaufmann]]|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=1-55860-874-5|pages=212–213|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Count leading zeros (clz) can be used to compute the 32-bit predicate "x = y" (zero if true, one if false) via the identity clz(x − y) &gt;&gt; 5, where "&gt;&gt;" is unsigned right shift.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Section 2-11: Comparison Predicates&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used to perform more sophisticated bit operations like finding the first string of ''n'' 1 bits.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Section 6-2. Find First String of 1-Bits of a Given Length.&lt;/ref&gt; The expression 1 &lt;&lt; (16&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;clz(x&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)/2) is an effective initial guess for computing the square root of a 32-bit integer using [[Newton's method]].&lt;ref&gt;Warren, 11-1: Integer Square Root.&lt;/ref&gt; CLZ can efficiently implement ''null suppression'', a fast [[data compression]] technique that encodes an integer as the number of leading zero bytes together with the nonzero bytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schlegel|first=Benjamin|author2=Rainer Gemulla |author3=Wolfgang Lehner |title=Fast integer compression using SIMD instructions|journal=Proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware (DaMoN 2010)|date=June 2010|pages=34–40|doi=10.1145/1869389.1869394}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 January 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It can also efficiently generate [[exponential distribution|exponentially distributed]] integers by taking the clz of [[uniform distribution (discrete)|uniformly random]] integers.&lt;ref name="hackersdelight-clz"/&gt;

The log base 2 can be used to anticipate whether a multiplication will overflow, since &lt;math&gt;\lceil\log_2 xy\rceil \leq \lceil\log_2 x\rceil + \lceil\log_2 y\rceil&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Section 2-12. Overflow Detection.&lt;/ref&gt;

Count leading zeros and count trailing zeros can be used together to implement [[Gosper's loop-detection algorithm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gosper|first=Bill|title=Loop detector|journal=HAKMEM|year=1972|issue=239|pages=Item 132|url=http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/hbaker/hakmem/flows.html#item132}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can find the period of a function of finite range using limited resources.&lt;ref name="hackersdelight-ctz"/&gt;

The [[binary GCD algorithm]] spends many cycles removing trailing zeros; this can be replaced by a count trailing zeros (ctz) followed by a shift. A similar loop appears in computations of the [[hailstone sequence]].

A [[bit array]] can be used to implement a [[priority queue]]. In this context, find first set (ffs) is useful in implementing the "pop" or "pull highest priority element" operation efficiently. The [[Linux kernel]] real-time scheduler internally uses &lt;code&gt;sched_find_first_bit()&lt;/code&gt; for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aas|first=Josh|title=Understanding the Linux 2.6.8.1 CPU Scheduler|year=2005|publisher=Silicon Graphics, Inc.|pages=19|url=http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/os/prac/lcpusched-fullpage-2x1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The count trailing zeros operation gives a simple optimal solution to the [[Tower of Hanoi]] problem: the disks are numbered from zero, and at move ''k'', disk number ctz(''k'') is moved the minimum possible distance to the right (circling back around to the left as needed). It can also generate a [[Gray code]] by taking an arbitrary word and flipping bit ctz(''k'') at step ''k''.&lt;ref name="hackersdelight-ctz"/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''finitely generated algebra''' (also called an '''algebra of finite type''') is an [[associative algebra]] ''A'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' where there exists a finite set of elements ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''A'' such that every element of ''A'' can be expressed as a [[polynomial]] in ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, with coefficients in ''K''. If it is necessary to emphasize the field ''K'' then the algebra is said to be finitely generated '''over ''K'' '''. Algebras that are not finitely generated are called '''infinitely generated'''. Finitely generated [[reduced ring|reduced]] [[commutative ring|commutative algebras]] are basic objects of consideration in modern [[algebraic geometry]], where they correspond to [[affine algebraic variety|affine algebraic varieties]]; for this reason, these algebras are also referred to as (commutative) '''affine algebras'''.

== Examples ==

* The [[polynomial algebra]] ''K''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] is finitely generated. The polynomial algebra in infinitely [[countable|countably many]] generators is infinitely generated. 
* The field ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''K''(''t'') of [[rational function]]s in one variable over an infinite field ''K'' is ''not'' a finitely generated algebra over ''K''. On the other hand, ''E'' is generated over ''K'' by a single element, ''t'', ''as a field''.
* If ''E''/''F'' is a [[finite field extension]] then it follows from the definitions that ''E'' is a finitely generated algebra over ''F''.
* Conversely, if ''E'' /''F'' is a field extension and ''E'' is a finitely generated algebra over ''F'' then the field extension is finite. This is called [[Zariski's lemma]]. See also [[integral extension]].
* If ''G'' is a [[finitely generated group]] then the [[group ring]] ''KG'' is a finitely generated algebra over ''K''.

== Properties ==

* A [[homomorphism|homomorphic image]] of a finitely generated algebra is itself finitely generated. However,  a similar property for [[subalgebra]]s does not hold in general.
* [[Hilbert's basis theorem]]: if ''A'' is a finitely generated commutative algebra then every [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of ''A'' is finitely generated, or equivalently, ''A'' is a [[Noetherian ring]].

In [[mathematics]], a set of natural numbers is called a '''K-trivial set''' if its [[Upper set|initial segments]] viewed as binary strings are easy to describe: the prefix-free [[Kolmogorov complexity]] is as low as possible, close to that of a [[recursive set|computable set]]. Solovay proved in 1975 that a set can be K-trivial without being computable.

The [[Schnorr–Levin theorem]] says that random sets have a  high initial segment complexity. Thus the K-trivials  are far  from random. This is why these sets  are studied in the field of [[Algorithmically random sequence|algorithmic randomness]], which is a subfield of [[Computability theory]]  and related to  [[algorithmic information theory]] in [[computer science]].

At the same time, K-trivial sets are close to computable. For instance,   they are all [[superlow]], i.e. sets whose [[Turing jump]] is computable from the [[Halting problem]], and form a [[Turing ideal]], i.e. class of sets closed under  [[Turing join]] and closed downward under [[Turing reduction]].

== Definition ==

Let K be the prefix-free [[Kolmogorov Complexity]], i.e. given a string x, K(x) outputs the least length of the input string under a [[Chaitin's constant#Background|prefix-free universal machine]].  Such a machine, intuitively, represents a universal programming language with the property that no valid program can be obtained as a proper extension of another valid program. For more background of K, see e.g. [[Chaitin's constant]].

We say a set A of the [[natural numbers]] is K-trivial via a constant  b ∈ ℕ    if

:&lt;math&gt;\forall n K(A\upharpoonright n)\leq K(n)+b &lt;/math&gt;.

A set is K-trivial if it is K-trivial via some constant.&lt;ref&gt;A. Nies (2009). Computability and Randomness, Oxford Science Publications, {{ISBN|978-0199230761}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downey, Rodney G., Hirschfeldt, Denis R. (2010), "Algorithmic Randomness and Complexity", {{ISBN|978-0-387-68441-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brief history and development ==

In the early days of the development of K-triviality, attention was paid to separation of K-trivial sets and [[Recursive set|computable sets]].

Chaitin  in his 1976 paper &lt;ref&gt;Gregory J. Chaitin (1976),
    "Information-Theoretic Characterizations of Recursive Infinite Strings",
    Theoretical Computer Science
Volume 2, Issue 1, June 1976, Pages 45–48&lt;/ref&gt;   mainly studied sets such that there exists  b ∈ℕ  with

:&lt;math&gt; \forall n C(A\upharpoonright n)\leq C(n)+b&lt;/math&gt;

where  C denotes the plain [[Kolmogorov complexity]]. These sets are   known as C-trivial sets. Chaitin showed they coincide with the computable sets. He also showed that the  K-trivials are computable in the [[halting problem]]. This class of sets is commonly known as &lt;math&gt;\Delta_2^0&lt;/math&gt; sets in [[arithmetical hierarchy]].

[[Robert M. Solovay]] was the first to construct a noncomputable K-trivial set, while construction of a computably enumerable such A was attempted by [[Cristian S. Calude|Calude]], Coles &lt;ref&gt;Cristian Calude, Richard J. Coles, Program-Size Complexity of Initial Segments and Domination Reducibility, (1999), proceeding of: Jewels are Forever, Contributions on Theoretical Computer Science in Honor of Arto Salomaa&lt;/ref&gt; and other unpublished constructions by Kummer of a K-trivial, and Muchnik junior of a low for K set.

=== Developments 1999–2008 ===

In the context of computability theory, a cost function is a computable function

:&lt;math&gt;c: \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{Q}^{\geq 0}.&lt;/math&gt;

For a computable approximation &lt;math&gt;\langle A_s \rangle&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\Delta_2^0&lt;/math&gt; set ''A'', such a function measures the cost ''c''(''n'',''s'')  of changing the approximation to A(n)  at stage s. The first [[Loss function|cost function]] construction was due to  Kučera and Terwijn.&lt;ref&gt;Antonin Kučera and Sebastiaan A. Terwijn (1999), "Lowness for the Class of Random Sets", The Journal of Symbolic Logic Vol. 64, No. 4 (Dec., 1999), pp. 1396–1402&lt;/ref&gt; They built a [[computably enumerable]] set that is low for Martin-Löf-randomness  but not computable. Their cost function was adaptive, in that the definition of the cost function depends on the computable approximation of the &lt;math&gt;\Delta_2^0&lt;/math&gt; set being built.

A cost function construction of a  K-trivial [[computably enumerable]] noncomputable set first appeared in Downey et al.&lt;ref&gt;Rod G. Downey,
Denis R. Hirschfeldt,
Andr ́e Nies,
Frank Stephan, "Trivial Reals", Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 66 No. 1 (2002), URL: {{cite web |url=http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs/volume66.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051003194223/http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs/volume66.html |archivedate=2005-10-03 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

We say a &lt;math&gt;\Delta_2^0&lt;/math&gt; set ''A'' obeys a cost function ''c'' if there exists a computable approximation of A, &lt;math&gt;\langle A_s: s\in \omega\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;S=\Sigma_{x,s} c(x,s)[x&lt;s \wedge \text{x is the least s.t. }A_{s-1}(x)\neq A_s(x)] &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

K-trivial sets are characterized&lt;ref name="AndreNies"&gt;André Nies, (2005), "Lowness properties and randomness", ''Advances in Mathematics'', Volume 197, Issue 1, 20 October 2005, Pages 274–305&lt;/ref&gt; by obedience to  the [[Standard cost function]], defined by

:&lt;math&gt;c_K (x,s)=\Sigma_{x &lt; y\leq s} 2^{-K_s(x)}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;K_s(x)=\min \{|\sigma|: \mathbb{U}_s(\sigma)=x\}&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}_s&lt;/math&gt; is the ''s''-th step in a computable approximation of a fixed universal prefix-free machine &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Sketch of the construction of a non-computable K-trivial set ====

In fact the set can be made [[promptly simple]]. The idea is to meet the prompt simplicity requirements,

:&lt;math&gt;PS_e: |W_e|=\infty\Rightarrow\exists s \exists x [x\in W_{e,s}\backslash W_{e,s-1} \wedge x\in A_s]&lt;/math&gt;

as well as to keep the costs low. We need the cost function to satisfy the '''limit condition'''

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_x \sup_{s&gt;x}c(x,s)=0&lt;/math&gt;

namely the supremum over stages of the cost for x goes to 0 as x increases. For instance, the [[standard cost function]] has this property. The construction essentially waits until the cost is low before putting numbers into &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to meet the promptly simple requirements. We define a computable enumeration &lt;math&gt;\langle A_s: s\in\omega\rangle&lt;/math&gt; such that

&lt;math&gt;A_0=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. At stage ''s''&gt;&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;, for each ''e''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''s'', if &lt;math&gt;PS_e&lt;/math&gt; has not been met yet and there exists ''x''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2''e'' such that &lt;math&gt;x\in W_{e,s}\backslash W_{e,s-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c(x,s)\leq 2^{-e}&lt;/math&gt;, then we put ''x'' into &lt;math&gt;A_s&lt;/math&gt; and declare that &lt;math&gt;PS_e&lt;/math&gt; is met. End of construction.

To verify that the construction works, note first that ''A'' obeys the cost function since at most one number enters ''A'' for the sake of each requirement. The sum ''S'' is therefore at most

:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_e 2^{-e} &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Secondly, each requirement is met: if  &lt;math&gt;W_e&lt;/math&gt; is infinite, by the fact that the cost function satisfies the limit condition, some number will eventually be enumerated into A to meet the requirement.

==== Equivalent characterizations ====

K-triviality turns out to coincide with some computational lowness notions, saying that a set is close to computable. The following notions capture the same class of sets.
&lt;ref name="AndreNies"/&gt;

===== Lowness  for ''K'' =====

We say that ''A''  is low for ''K''  if there is ''b'' ∈ ℕ such that

:&lt;math&gt;   \forall n K^A(n)+b \geq K(n). &lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt; K^A&lt;/math&gt; is prefix-free [[Kolmogorov complexity]] relative to  oracle &lt;math&gt; A&lt;/math&gt;.

===== Lowness for Martin-Löf-randomness =====

A is low for Martin-Löf-randomness&lt;ref&gt;Antonin Kučera and Sebastiaan A. Terwijn (1999), "Lowness for the Class of Random Sets", ''The Journal of Symbolic Logic'', Vol. 64, No. 4 (Dec., 1999), pp. 1396–1402&lt;/ref&gt; if whenever Z  is [[Algorithmically random sequence|Martin-Löf random]], it is already [[Algorithmically random sequence|Martin-Löf random]] relative to ''A''.

===== Base for Martin-Löf-randomness =====

''A'' is a base for Martin-Löf-randomness if ''A'' is [[Turing reduction|Turing reducible]] to ''Z'' for some set ''Z'' that is [[Algorithmically random sequence|Martin-Löf random]] relative to ''A''.

&lt;ref name="AndreNies" /&gt;

More equivalent characterizations of K-triviality have been studied, such as: 
# Lowness for weakly-2-randomness;
# Lowness for difference-left-c.e. reals (notice here no randomness is mentioned).

=== Developments after 2008 ===

From 2009 on, concepts from analysis entered the stage.  This helped solving some notorious problems.

One says that a set Y is a positive density point if every effectively closed class containing Y has positive lower Lebesgue density at Y.  Bienvenu, Hölzl, Miller, and Nies&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Bienvenu, Rupert Hölzl, Joseph S. Miller, and André Nies, (2012), "The Denjoy alternative for computable functions", Proceedings of the 29th International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science (STACS 2012), volume 14 of Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics, pages 543–554. Schloss Dagstuhl–Leibniz-Zentrum fuer Informatik, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that a ML-random is Turing incomplete iff it is a positive density point.  Day and Miller&lt;ref&gt;J. Miller, A. Day. (2012) "Cupping with random sets", To appear in the Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society&lt;/ref&gt; used this for an affirmative answer to the ML-cupping problem:&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Nies, Randomness and computability: Open questions. Bull. Symb. Logic. 12 no 3 (2006) 390-410&lt;/ref&gt; A is K-trivial iff for every Martin-Löf random set Z such that A⊕Z compute the [[halting problem]], already Z by itself computes the [[halting problem]].

One says that a set Y is a density-one point if every effectively closed class containing Y has Lebesgue density 1 at Y.  Any  Martin-Löf random set that is not a density-one point computes every K trivial set by Bienvenu, et al.&lt;ref&gt;Bienvenu, Greenberg, Kucera, Nies and Turetsky, "K-Triviality, Oberwolfach Randomness, and Differentiability", Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach, Oberwolfach Preprints (OWP), {{issn|1864-7596}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Day and Miller showed that there is Martin-Löf random set which is a positive density point but not a density one point.  Thus there is an incomplete such Martin-Löf random set which computes every K-trivial set.  This affirmatively answered the [[covering problem]] first asked by Stephan and then published by Miller and Nies.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Nies, Randomness and computability: Open questions. Bull. Symb. Logic. 12 no 3 (2006) 390–410&lt;/ref&gt;  For a summary see L. Bienvenu, A. Day, N. Greenberg, A. Kucera, J. Miller, A. Nies, and D. Turetsky&lt;ref&gt;Computing K-trivial sets by incomplete random sets. Bull. Symbolic Logic. 20, March 2014, pp 80-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Variants of K-triviality have been studied:
* [[Schnorr trivial sets]] where the machines have domain with computable measure.
* [[strongly jump traceable sets]], a lowness property of sets far inside K-triviality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2859">In [[operator algebra]], the '''Koecher–Vinberg theorem''' is a reconstruction theorem for real [[Jordan algebra]]s. It was proved independently by [[Max Koecher]] in 1957&lt;ref name=koecher&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koecher|first=Max|title=Positivitatsbereiche im R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;|journal=American Journal of Mathematics|year=1957|volume=97|issue=3|pages=575–596|doi=10.2307/2372563}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ernest Vinberg]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vinberg|first=E. B.|title=Homogeneous Cones|journal=Soviet Math. Dokl.|year=1961|volume=1|pages=787–790}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between
[[jordan algebra#Formally real Jordan algebras|formally real Jordan algebras]] and so-called domains of positivity. Thus it links [[operator algebra]]ic and [[Convex function|convex]] [[Order theory|order theoretic]] views on state spaces of physical systems.

==Statement==
A [[convex cone]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is called ''regular'' if &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt; whenever both &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-a&lt;/math&gt; are in the closure &lt;math&gt;\overline{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

A convex cone &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; in a [[vector space]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with an [[inner product]] has a ''dual cone'' &lt;math&gt;C^* = \{ a \in A \colon \forall b \in C \langle a,b\rangle &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. The cone is called ''self-dual'' when &lt;math&gt;C=C^*&lt;/math&gt;. It is called ''homogeneous'' when to any two points &lt;math&gt;a,b \in C&lt;/math&gt; there is a real [[linear transformation]] &lt;math&gt;T \colon A \to A&lt;/math&gt; that restricts to a bijection &lt;math&gt;C \to C&lt;/math&gt; and satisfies &lt;math&gt;T(a)=b&lt;/math&gt;.

The Koecher–Vinberg theorem now states that these properties precisely characterize the positive cones of Jordan algebras.

'''Theorem''': There is a one-to-one correspondence between [[jordan algebra#Formally real Jordan algebras|formally real Jordan algebras]] and convex cones that are:
* open;
* regular;
* homogeneous;
* self-dual.

Convex cones satisfying these four properties are called ''domains of positivity'' or ''symmetric cones''. The domain of positivity associated with a real Jordan algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the interior of the 'positive' cone &lt;math&gt;A_+ = \{ a^2 \colon a \in A \}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2994">In [[differential geometry]], a '''Kähler–Einstein metric''' on a [[complex manifold]] is a [[Riemannian metric]] that is both a [[Kähler metric]] and an [[Einstein manifold|Einstein metric]].  A [[manifold]] is said to be '''Kähler–Einstein''' if it admits a Kähler–Einstein metric.  The most important special case of these are the [[Calabi–Yau manifold]]s, which are Kähler and [[Ricci-flat]].

The most important problem for this area is the existence of Kähler–Einstein metrics for compact Kähler manifolds.

In the case in which there is a Kähler metric, the Ricci curvature is proportional to the Kähler metric. Therefore, the [[Chern class|first Chern class]] is either negative, or zero, or positive.

When the first Chern class is negative, Aubin and Yau proved that there is always a Kähler–Einstein metric.

When the first Chern class is zero, Yau proved the [[Calabi conjecture]] that there is always a Kähler–Einstein metric. [[Shing-Tung Yau]] was awarded with his Fields medal because of this work. That leads to the name Calabi–Yau manifolds.

The third case, the positive or Fano case, is the hardest. In this case, there is a non-trivial obstruction to existence. In 2012, Chen, Donaldson, and Sun proved that in this case existence is equivalent to an  algebro-geometric criterion called [[K-stability]]. Their proof appeared in a series of articles in the Journal of the American Mathematical Society.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Xiuxiong; [[Simon Donaldson|Donaldson, Simon]]; Sun, Song Kähler-Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds.

====''Vollständige Anleitung zur Algebra''====

* [[Leonhard Euler]] (1770)
Also known as [[Elements of Algebra]], Euler's textbook on elementary algebra is one of the first to set out algebra in the modern form we would recognize today.  The first volume deals with determinate equations, while the second part deals with [[Diophantine equation]]s.  The last section contains a proof of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] for the case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, making some valid assumptions regarding '''Q'''({{radic|−3}}) that Euler did not prove.&lt;ref name=Weil239&gt;{{Cite book| last = Weil | first = André  | title = Number Theory: An approach through history From Hammurapi to Legendre | publisher = Birkhäuser | year = 1984 | pages = 239–242 | isbn = 0-8176-3141-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Abstract algebra]]===

====[[Group (mathematics)|Group theory]]====

=====''Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations''=====
*[[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] (1770)
The title means "Reflections on the algebraic solutions of equations". Made the prescient observation that the roots of the [[Lagrange resolvent]] of a polynomial equation are tied to permutations of the roots of the original equation, laying a more general foundation for what had previously been an ad hoc analysis and helping motivate the later development of the theory of [[permutation groups]], [[group theory]], and [[Galois theory]]. The Lagrange resolvent also introduced the [[discrete Fourier transform]] of order 3.

====''Articles Publiés par Galois dans les Annales de Mathématiques''====

* Journal de Mathematiques pures et Appliquées, II (1846)
Posthumous publication of the mathematical manuscripts of [[Évariste Galois]] by [[Joseph Liouville]].  Included are Galois' papers ''Mémoire sur les conditions de résolubilité des équations par radicaux'' and ''Des équations primitives qui sont solubles par radicaux''.

====''Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques''====

*[[Camille Jordan]] (1870)
'''Online version:''' [https://books.google.com/books?id=TzQAAAAAQAAJ Online version]

Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques (Treatise on Substitutions and Algebraic Equations).  The first book on group theory, giving a then-comprehensive study of permutation groups  and Galois theory.  In this book, Jordan introduced the notion of a [[simple group]] and [[epimorphism]] (which he called ''l'isomorphisme mériédrique''),&lt;ref name=19thcentury&gt;{{Cite book| title = Mathematics of the 19th Century: Mathematical Logic, Algebra, Number Theory, and Probability Theory | publisher =  Birkhäuser Verlag | year = 2001 | pages = 39, 63, 66–68 | isbn = 3-7643-6441-6 | author = ed. by A.

====''Theorie der Transformationsgruppen''====

*[[Sophus Lie]], [[Friedrich Engel (mathematician)|Friedrich Engel]] (1888–1893).

'''Publication data:''' 3 volumes, B.G. Teubner, Verlagsgesellschaft, mbH, Leipzig, 1888–1893.  [https://archive.org/details/theotransformation01liesrich Volume 1], [https://archive.org/details/theotransformation02liesrich Volume 2], [https://archive.org/details/theotransformation03liesrich Volume 3].

The first comprehensive work on [[transformation group]]s, serving as the foundation for the modern theory of [[Lie group]]s.

====''Solvability of groups of odd order''====

*[[Walter Feit]] and [[John Griggs Thompson|John Thompson]] (1960)
'''Description:''' Gave a complete proof of the [[Feit–Thompson theorem|solvability of finite groups of odd order]], establishing the long-standing Burnside conjecture that all finite non-abelian simple groups are of even order. Many of the original techniques used in this paper were used in the eventual [[classification of finite simple groups]].

====[[Homological algebra]]====

====''Homological Algebra''====

* [[Henri Cartan]] and [[Samuel Eilenberg]] (1956)
Provided the first fully worked out treatment of abstract homological algebra, unifying previously disparate presentations of homology and cohomology for [[associative algebra]]s, [[Lie algebra]]s, and [[group (mathematics)|group]]s into a single theory.

===="Sur Quelques Points d'Algèbre Homologique"====

* [[Alexander Grothendieck]] (1957)
Revolutionized [[homological algebra]] by introducing [[abelian category|abelian categories]] and providing a general framework for Cartan and Eilenberg's notion of [[derived functor]]s.

==[[Algebraic geometry]]==

==="Theorie der Abelschen Functionen"===

* [[Bernhard Riemann]] (1857)
'''Publication data:''' ''Journal für die Reine und Angewandte Mathematik''

Developed the concept of Riemann surfaces and their topological properties beyond Riemann's 1851 thesis work, proved an index theorem for the genus (the original formulation of the [[Riemann–Hurwitz formula]]), proved the Riemann inequality for the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with prescribed poles (the original formulation of the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]]), discussed birational transformations of a given curve and the dimension of the corresponding moduli space of inequivalent curves of a given genus, and solved more general inversion problems than those investigated by [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] and [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Jacobi]].  [[André Weil]] once wrote that this paper "''is one of the greatest pieces of mathematics that has ever been written; there is not a single word in it that is not of consequence.''" &lt;ref name=Krieger2007&gt;

===''Faisceaux Algébriques Cohérents''===

* [[Jean-Pierre Serre]]
'''Publication data:''' ''Annals of Mathematics'', 1955

''FAC'', as it is usually called, was foundational for the use of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] in algebraic geometry, extending beyond the case of [[complex manifold]]s.  Serre introduced [[Čech cohomology]] of sheaves in this paper, and, despite some technical deficiencies, revolutionized formulations of algebraic geometry.  For example, the [[long exact sequence]] in sheaf cohomology allows one to show that some surjective maps of sheaves induce surjective maps on sections; specifically, these are the maps whose kernel (as a sheaf) has a vanishing first cohomology group.  The dimension of a vector space of sections of a [[coherent sheaf]] is finite, in [[projective geometry]], and such dimensions include many discrete invariants of varieties, for example [[Hodge number]]s.  While Grothendieck's [[derived functor]] cohomology has replaced Čech cohomology for technical reasons, actual calculations, such as of the cohomology of projective space, are usually carried out by Čech techniques, and for this reason Serre's paper remains important.

===''[[Algebraic geometry and analytic geometry|Géométrie Algébrique et Géométrie Analytique]]''===

* [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] (1956)
In [[mathematics]], [[algebraic geometry]] and [[analytic geometry]] are closely related subjects, where ''analytic geometry'' is the theory of [[complex manifold]]s and the more general [[analytic geometry|analytic space]]s defined locally by the vanishing of [[analytic function]]s of [[several complex variables]]. A (mathematical) theory of the relationship between the two was put in place during the early part of the 1950s, as part of the business of laying the foundations of algebraic geometry to include, for example, techniques from [[Hodge theory]]. (''NB'' While [[analytic geometry]] as use of Cartesian coordinates is also in a sense included in the scope of algebraic geometry, that is not the topic being discussed in this article.) The major paper consolidating the theory was ''Géometrie Algébrique et Géométrie Analytique'' by [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]], now usually referred to as ''GAGA''. A ''GAGA-style result'' would now mean any theorem of comparison, allowing passage between a category of objects from algebraic geometry, and their morphisms, and a well-defined subcategory of analytic geometry objects and holomorphic mappings.

==="Le théorème de Riemann–Roch, d'après A. Grothendieck"===

* [[Armand Borel]], [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] (1958)
Borel and Serre's exposition of Grothendieck's version of the [[Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem|Riemann–Roch theorem]], published after Grothendieck made it clear that he was not interested in writing up his own result.  Grothendieck reinterpreted both sides of the formula that [[Hirzebruch]] proved in 1953 in the framework of [[morphisms]] between varieties, resulting in a sweeping generalization.&lt;ref name=Jackson2004&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Jackson  | first = Allyn  |date=October 2004 | title = Comme Appelé du Néant — As If Summoned from the Void: The Life of Alexandre Grothendieck  | journal = [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]  | volume = 51  | issue = 9  | pages = 1045–1046
  | url = http://www.ams.org/notices/200409/fea-grothendieck-part1.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 13 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his proof, Grothendieck broke new ground with his concept of [[Grothendieck group]]s, which led to the development of [[K-theory]].&lt;ref name="Dieudonné598"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dieudonné | first = Jean | title = A history of algebraic and differential topology 1900–1960 | publisher = Birkhäuser | year = 1989 | pages = 598–600 | isbn = 0-8176-3388-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''[[Éléments de géométrie algébrique]]''===

* [[Alexander Grothendieck]] (1960–1967)
Written with the assistance of [[Jean Dieudonné]], this is [[Grothendieck]]'s exposition of his reworking of the foundations of algebraic geometry.  It has become the most important foundational work in modern algebraic geometry.  The approach expounded in EGA, as these books are known, transformed the field and led to monumental advances.

===''[[Séminaire de géométrie algébrique]]''===

* [[Alexander Grothendieck]] et al.
These seminar notes on Grothendieck's reworking of the foundations of algebraic geometry report on work done at [[IHÉS]] starting in the 1960s. SGA 1 dates from the seminars of 1960–1961, and the last in the series, SGA 7, dates from 1967 to 1969. In contrast to EGA, which is intended to set foundations, SGA describes ongoing research as it unfolded in Grothendieck's seminar; as a result, it is quite difficult to read, since many of the more elementary and foundational results were relegated to EGA. One of the major results building on the results in SGA is [[Pierre Deligne]]'s proof of the last of the open [[Weil conjectures]] in the early 1970s. Other authors who worked on one or several volumes of SGA include [[Michel Raynaud]], [[Michael Artin]], [[Jean-Pierre Serre]], [[Jean-Louis Verdier]], [[Pierre Deligne]], and [[Nicholas Katz]].

==[[Number theory]]==

===''[[Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta]]''===

*[[Brahmagupta]] (628)
Brahmagupta's [[Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta]] is the first book that mentions zero as a number, hence Brahmagupta is considered the first to formulate the concept of zero. The current system of the four fundamental operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) based on the Hindu-Arabic number system also first appeared in Brahmasphutasiddhanta. It was also one of the first texts to provide concrete ideas on positive and negative numbers.

===''De fractionibus continuis dissertatio''===

===''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]''===

*[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1801)
The ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' is a profound and masterful book on [[number theory]] written by [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and first published in 1801 when Gauss was 24. In this book Gauss brings together results in number theory obtained by mathematicians such as [[Fermat]], [[Euler]], [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]] and adds many important new results of his own.  Among his contributions was the first complete proof known of the [[Fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], the first two published proofs of the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]], a deep investigation of binary [[quadratic forms]] going beyond Lagrange's work in Recherches d'Arithmétique, a first appearance of [[Gauss sums]], [[cyclotomy#Cyclotomic fields|cyclotomy]], and the theory of [[constructible polygon]]s with a particular application to the constructibility of the regular [[Heptadecagon|17-gon]].  Of note, in section V, article 303 of Disquisitiones, Gauss summarized his calculations of [[Class number (number theory)|class numbers]] of imaginary quadratic number fields, and in fact found all imaginary quadratic number fields of class numbers 1, 2, and 3 (confirmed in 1986) as he had [[Class number problem|conjectured]].&lt;ref name=irelandrosen&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Ireland | first1 = K. |last2 = Rosen | first2 = M. | title = A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory  | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year = 1993  | location = New York, New York  | pages = 358–361  | isbn = 0-387-97329-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In section VII, article 358, Gauss proved what can be interpreted as the first non-trivial case of the Riemann Hypothesis for curves over finite fields (the [[Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves#Hasse-Weil Bound|Hasse–Weil theorem]]).&lt;ref name=silvermantate&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Silverman | first1 = J. |last2 = Tate | first2 = J. | title = Rational Points on Elliptic Curves  | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year = 1992 | location = New York, New York  | isbn = 0-387-97825-9  | page = 110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="[[On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude|Über die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Grösse]]"===

*[[Bernhard Riemann]] (1859)
"Über die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Grösse" (or "On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude") is a seminal 8-page paper by Bernhard Riemann published in the November 1859 edition of the ''Monthly Reports of the Berlin Academy''. Although it is the only paper he ever published on number theory, it contains ideas which influenced dozens of researchers during the late 19th century and up to the present day. The paper consists primarily of definitions, heuristic arguments, sketches of proofs, and the application of powerful analytic methods; all of these have become essential concepts and tools of modern [[analytic number theory]].  It also contains the famous [[Riemann Hypothesis]], one of the most important open problems in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Edwards (mathematician)|H. M. Edwards]], ''Riemann's Zeta Function'', Academic Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

===''[[Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie]]''===

* [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] and [[Richard Dedekind]]
''[[Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie]]'' (''Lectures on Number Theory'') is a textbook of [[number theory]] written by [[Germany|German]] mathematicians P. G. Lejeune Dirichlet and R. Dedekind, and published in 1863.
The ''Vorlesungen'' can be seen as a watershed between the classical number theory of [[Fermat]], [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Jacobi]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], and the modern number theory of Dedekind, [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]] and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]. Dirichlet does not explicitly recognise the concept of the [[group theory|group]] that is central to [[Abstract algebra|modern algebra]], but many of his proofs show an implicit understanding of group theory

===''[[Zahlbericht]]''===
* [[David Hilbert]] (1897)
Unified and made accessible many of the developments in [[algebraic number theory]] made during the nineteenth century.

===''Fourier Analysis in Number Fields and Hecke's Zeta-Functions''===

* [[John Tate]] (1950)
Generally referred to simply as ''[[Tate's Thesis]]'', Tate's [[Princeton University|Princeton]] Ph.D. thesis, under [[Emil Artin]], is a reworking of [[Erich Hecke]]'s theory of zeta- and ''L''-functions in terms of [[Fourier analysis]] on the [[Adele ring|adeles]]. The introduction of these methods into number theory made it possible to formulate extensions of Hecke's results to more general ''L''-functions such as those arising from [[automorphic form]]s.

==="[[Automorphic Forms on GL(2)]]"===

* [[Hervé Jacquet]] and [[Robert Langlands]] (1970)
This publication offers evidence towards Langlands' conjectures by reworking and expanding the classical theory of [[modular form]]s and their ''L''-functions through the introduction of representation theory.

==="La conjecture de Weil. I."===

* [[Pierre Deligne]] (1974)
Proved the Riemann hypothesis for varieties over finite fields, settling the last of the open [[Weil conjectures]].

==="Endlichkeitssätze für abelsche Varietäten über Zahlkörpern"===

* [[Gerd Faltings]] (1983)
Faltings proves a collection of important results in this paper, the most famous of which is the first proof of the [[Mordell conjecture]] (a conjecture dating back to 1922). Other theorems proved in this paper include an instance of the [[Tate conjecture]] (relating the [[homomorphism]]s between two [[abelian varieties]] over a [[number field]] to the homomorphisms between their [[Tate module]]s) and some finiteness results concerning abelian varieties over number fields with certain properties.

==="Modular Elliptic Curves and Fermat's Last Theorem"===

* [[Andrew Wiles]] (1995)
This article proceeds to prove a special case of the [[Modularity theorem|Shimura–Taniyama conjecture]] through the study of the [[Galois deformation theory|deformation theory]] of [[Galois representations]]. This in turn implies the famed [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. The proof's method of identification of a [[deformation ring]] with a [[Hecke operator|Hecke algebra]] (now referred to as an ''R=T'' theorem) to prove modularity lifting theorems has been an influential development in algebraic number theory.

===''The geometry and cohomology of some simple Shimura varieties''===

* Michael Harris and [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]] (2001)
Harris and Taylor provide the first proof of the [[local Langlands conjecture]] for [[GL(n)|GL(''n'')]]. As part of the proof, this monograph also makes an in depth study of the geometry and cohomology of certain Shimura varieties at primes of bad reduction.

Perhaps the most influential scientific book ever published, it contains the statement of [[Newton's laws of motion]] forming the foundation of [[classical mechanics]] as well as his [[Gravity|law of universal gravitation]], and derives [[laws of Kepler|Kepler's laws]] for the motion of the [[planet]]s (which were first obtained empirically). Here was born the practice, now so standard we identify it with science, of explaining nature by postulating mathematical axioms and demonstrating that their conclusion are observable phenomena.  In formulating his physical theories, Newton freely used his unpublished work on calculus.  When he submitted Principia for publication, however, Newton chose to recast the majority of his proofs as geometric arguments.&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;{{Cite web| last = Gray | first = Jeremy| title=MAA Book Review: Reading the Principia: The Debate on Newton's Mathematical Methods for Natural Philosophy from 1687 to 1736 by Niccolò Guicciardini|url=http://www.maa.org/reviews/readnewton.html| year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduced [[Fourier analysis]], specifically [[Fourier series]]. Key contribution was to not simply use [[trigonometric series]], but to model ''all'' functions by trigonometric series.
{{cquote|&lt;math&gt;\varphi(y)=a\cos\frac{\pi y}{2}+a'\cos 3\frac{\pi y}{2}+a''\cos5\frac{\pi y}{2}+\cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying both sides by &lt;math&gt;\cos(2i+1)\frac{\pi y}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and then integrating from &lt;math&gt;y=-1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y=+1&lt;/math&gt; yields:

&lt;math&gt;a_i=\int_{-1}^1\varphi(y)\cos(2i+1)\frac{\pi y}{2}\,dy.&lt;/math&gt;}}
When Fourier submitted his paper in 1807, the committee (which included [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], [[Laplace]], [[Étienne-Louis Malus|Malus]] and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]], among others) concluded: ''...the manner in which the author arrives at these equations is not exempt of difficulties and [...]  his analysis to integrate them still leaves something to be desired on the score of generality and even rigour''. Making Fourier series rigorous, which in detail took over a century, led directly to a number of developments in analysis, notably the rigorous statement of the integral via the [[Dirichlet integral]] and later the [[Lebesgue integral]].

===''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]''===

* Unknown author
This was a Chinese [[mathematics]] book, mostly geometric, composed during the [[Han Dynasty]], perhaps as early as 200 BC. It remained the most important textbook in [[China]] and [[East Asia]] for over a thousand years, similar to the position of Euclid's ''Elements'' in Europe. Among its contents: Linear problems solved using the principle known later in the West as the ''[[rule of false position]]''. Problems with several unknowns, solved by a principle similar to [[Gaussian elimination]]. Problems involving the principle known in the West as the [[Pythagorean theorem]]. The earliest solution of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] using a method equivalent to the modern method.

===''[[On Conic Sections|The Conics]]''===

* [[Apollonius of Perga]]
The Conics was written by Apollonius of Perga, a [[Greek people|Greek]] mathematician. His innovative methodology and terminology, especially in the field of [[conics]], influenced many later scholars including [[Ptolemy]], [[Francesco Maurolico]], [[Isaac Newton]], and [[René Descartes]]. It was Apollonius who gave the [[ellipse]], the [[parabola]], and the [[hyperbola]] the names by which we know them.

===''[[Surya Siddhanta]]''===

* Unknown (400 CE)
Contains the roots of modern trigonometry. It describes the archeo-astronomy theories, principles and methods of the ancient Hindus. This siddhanta is supposed to be the knowledge that the Sun god gave to an Asura called Maya. It uses sine (jya), cosine (kojya or "perpendicular sine") and inverse sine (otkram jya) for the first time, and also contains the earliest use of the tangent and secant. Later Indian mathematicians such as Aryabhata made references to this text, while later Arabic and Latin translations were very influential in Europe and the Middle East.

===''[[Aryabhatiya]]''===

*[[Aryabhata]] (499 CE)
This was a highly influential text during the Golden Age of mathematics in India. The text was highly concise and therefore elaborated upon in commentaries by later mathematicians. It made significant contributions to geometry and astronomy, including introduction of sine/ cosine, determination of the approximate value of pi and accurate calculation of the earth's circumference.

===''[[La Géométrie]]''===

* [[René Descartes]]
La Géométrie was [[publishing|published]] in 1637 and [[writing|written]] by [[René Descartes]]. The book was influential in developing the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] and specifically discussed the representation of [[Point (geometry)|point]]s of a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]], via [[real number]]s; and the representation of [[curve]]s, via [[equation]]s.

Hilbert's axiomatization of geometry, whose primary influence was in its pioneering approach to metamathematical questions including the use of models to prove axiom independence and the importance of establishing the consistency and completeness of an axiomatic system.

===''[[Regular Polytopes (book)|Regular Polytopes]]''===

* [[H.S.M. Coxeter]]
''Regular Polytopes'' is a comprehensive survey of the geometry of [[regular polytope]]s, the generalisation of regular [[polygon]]s and regular [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] to higher dimensions. Originating with an essay entitled ''Dimensional Analogy'' written in 1923, the first edition of the book took Coxeter 24 years to complete. Originally written in 1947, the book was updated and republished in 1963 and 1973.

==[[Topology]]==

===''Analysis situs''===

* [[Henri Poincaré]] (1895, 1899–1905)
'''Description:''' Poincaré's [[Analysis Situs (paper)|Analysis Situs]] and his Compléments à l'Analysis Situs laid the general foundations for [[algebraic topology]].  In these papers, Poincaré introduced the notions of [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] and the [[fundamental group]], provided an early formulation of [[Poincaré duality]], gave the [[Euler–Poincaré characteristic]] for [[chain complexes]], and mentioned several important conjectures including the [[Poincaré conjecture]].

===''L'anneau d'homologie d'une représentation'', ''Structure de l'anneau d'homologie d'une représentation''===

* [[Jean Leray]] (1946)
These two [[Comptes Rendus]] notes of Leray from 1946 introduced the novel concepts of [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheafs]], [[sheaf cohomology]], and [[spectral sequences]], which he had developed during his years of captivity as a prisoner of war.  Leray's announcements and applications (published in other Comptes Rendus notes from 1946) drew immediate attention from other mathematicians.  Subsequent clarification, development, and generalization by [[Henri Cartan]], [[Jean-Louis Koszul]], [[Armand Borel]], [[Jean-Pierre Serre]], and Leray himself allowed these concepts to be understood and applied to many other areas of mathematics.&lt;ref name=HaynesMiller&gt;{{Cite web| last = Miller | first = Haynes | title = Leray in Oflag XVIIA: The origins of sheaf theory, sheaf cohomology, and spectral sequences | work = | publisher = | year = 2000 | url = http://www-math.mit.edu/~hrm/papers/ss.ps | format = [[PostScript|ps]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dieudonné would later write that these notions created by Leray "''undoubtedly rank at the same level in the history of mathematics as the methods invented by Poincaré and Brouwer''".&lt;ref name="Dieudonné123"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dieudonné | first = Jean | title = A history of algebraic and differential topology 1900–1960 | publisher = Birkhäuser | year = 1989 | pages = 123–141 | isbn = 0-8176-3388-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quelques propriétés globales des variétés differentiables===

*[[René Thom]] (1954)
In this paper, Thom proved the Thom transversality theorem, introduced the notions of [[cobordism#Oriented cobordism|oriented]] and [[List of cohomology theories#Unoriented cobordism|unoriented cobordism]], and demonstrated that cobordism groups could be computed as the homotopy groups of certain [[Thom space]]s.

==[[Category theory]]==

==="General Theory of Natural Equivalences"===

* [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]] (1945)
The first paper on category theory. Mac Lane later wrote in ''Categories for the Working Mathematician'' that he and Eilenberg introduced categories so that they could introduce functors, and they introduced functors so that they could introduce natural equivalences. Prior to this paper, "natural" was used in an informal and imprecise way to designate constructions that could be made without making any choices. Afterwards, "natural" had a precise meaning which occurred in a wide variety of contexts and had powerful and important consequences.

===''[[Categories for the Working Mathematician]]''===

* [[Saunders Mac Lane]] (1971, second edition 1998)
Saunders Mac Lane, one of the founders of category theory, wrote this exposition to bring categories to the masses.  Mac Lane brings to the fore the important concepts that make category theory useful, such as [[adjoint functor]]s and [[universal properties]].

===''[[Higher Topos Theory]]''===
* [[Jacob Lurie]] (2010)
''This purpose of this book is twofold: to provide a general introduction to higher category theory (using the formalism of "quasicategories" or "weak Kan complexes"), and to apply this theory to the study of higher versions of Grothendieck topoi. A few applications to classical topology are included.'' (see arXiv.)

==[[Set theory]]==

==="Über eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen"===

* [[Georg Cantor]] (1874)
'''Online version:''' [http://www.digizeitschriften.de/main/dms/img/?PPN=GDZPPN002155583 Online version]

Contains the first proof that the set of all real numbers is uncountable; also contains a proof that the set of algebraic numbers is countable. (See [[Georg Cantor's first set theory article]].)

===''[[Grundzüge der Mengenlehre]]''===

* [[Felix Hausdorff]]
First published in 1914, this was the first comprehensive introduction to set theory. Besides the systematic treatment of known results in set theory, the book also contains chapters on [[measure theory]] and topology, which were then still considered parts of set theory. Here Hausdorff presents and develops highly original material which was later to become the basis for those areas.

==="The consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum-hypothesis with the axioms of set theory"===

* [[Kurt Gödel]] (1938)
Gödel proves the results of the title.  Also, in the process, introduces the [[constructible universe|class L of constructible sets]], a major influence in the development of axiomatic set theory.

==="The Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis"===

* [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul J. Cohen]] (1963, 1964)
Cohen's breakthrough work proved the independence of the [[continuum hypothesis]] and axiom of choice with respect to [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]].  In proving this Cohen introduced the concept of ''[[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]]'' which led to many other major results in axiomatic set theory.

==[[Logic]]==

===''[[The Laws of Thought]]''===

* [[George Boole]] (1854)
Published in 1854, [[The Laws of Thought]] was the first book to provide a mathematical foundation for logic. Its aim was a complete re-expression and extension of Aristotle's logic in the language of mathematics. Boole's work founded the discipline of algebraic logic and would later be central for [[Claude Shannon]] in the development of digital logic.

===''[[Begriffsschrift]]''===

* [[Gottlob Frege]] (1879)
Published in 1879, the title '''''Begriffsschrift''''' is usually translated as ''concept writing'' or ''concept notation''; the full title of the book identifies it as "''a [[formula]] [[language]], modelled on that of [[arithmetic]], of pure [[thought]]''". Frege's motivation for developing his [[formal logical system]] was similar to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s desire for a ''[[calculus ratiocinator]]''. Frege defines a logical calculus to support his research in the [[foundations of mathematics]]. '''''Begriffsschrift''''' is both the name of the book and the calculus defined therein.  It was arguably the most significant publication in [[logic]] since [[Aristotle]].

===''[[Formulario mathematico]]''===

* [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1895)
First published in 1895, the '''Formulario mathematico''' was the first mathematical book written entirely in a [[formal language|formalized language]]. It contained a description of [[mathematical logic]] and many important theorems in other branches of mathematics. Many of the notations introduced in the book are now in common use.

===''[[Principia Mathematica]]''===

* [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] (1910–1913)
The '''''Principia Mathematica''''' is a three-volume work on the foundations of [[mathematics]], written by [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and published in 1910–1913. It is an attempt to derive all mathematical truths from a well-defined set of axioms and inference rules in [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]]. The questions remained whether a contradiction could be derived from the Principia's axioms, and whether there exists a mathematical statement which could neither be proven nor disproven in the system. These questions were settled, in a rather surprising way, by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] in 1931.

===''[[Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals]]''===

* [[Alan Turing]]'s Ph.D. thesis

==="Über formal unentscheidbare Sätze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme, I"===

'''Online version:''' [http://www.springerlink.com/content/p03501kn35215860/ Online version]

In [[mathematical logic]], '''[[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]]''' are two celebrated theorems proved by [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1931.
The first incompleteness theorem states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For any formal system such that (1) it is &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-consistent ([[omega-consistent]]), (2) it has a [[recursively definable]] set of [[axioms]] and [[rules of derivation]], and (3) every [[computable function#Computable sets and relations|recursive]] relation of natural numbers is definable in it, there exists a formula of the system such that, according to the intended interpretation of the system, it expresses a truth about natural numbers and yet it is not a [[theorem]] of the system.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*[[Endre Szemerédi]] (1975)
Settled a conjecture of [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Pál Turán]] (now known as [[Szemerédi's theorem]]) that if a sequence of natural numbers has positive upper density then it contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.

These are publications that are not necessarily relevant to a mathematician nowadays, but are nonetheless important publications in the [[history of mathematics]].

===''[[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]]''===

* [[Ahmes]] ([[scribe]])

One of the oldest mathematical texts, dating to the [[Second Intermediate Period]] of [[ancient Egypt]]. It was copied by the scribe [[Ahmes]] (properly ''Ahmose'') from an older [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] [[papyrus]]. It laid the foundations of [[Egyptian mathematics]] and in turn, later influenced [[Greek mathematics|Greek and Hellenistic mathematics]]. Besides describing how to obtain an approximation of π only missing the mark by less than one per cent, it is describes one of the earliest attempts at [[squaring the circle]] and in the process provides persuasive evidence against the theory that the [[Egyptians]] deliberately built their [[pyramid]]s to enshrine the value of π in the proportions. Even though it would be a strong overstatement to suggest that the papyrus represents even rudimentary attempts at analytical geometry, Ahmes did make use of a kind of an analogue of the [[cotangent]].

===''[[Archimedes Palimpsest]]''===

*[[Archimedes|Archimedes of Syracuse]]
Although the only mathematical tools at its author's disposal were what we might now consider secondary-school [[geometry]], he used those methods with rare brilliance, explicitly using [[infinitesimal]]s to solve problems that would now be treated by integral calculus.  Among those problems were that of the [[center of gravity]] of a solid hemisphere, that of the center of gravity of a frustum of a circular paraboloid, and that of the area of a region bounded by a [[parabola]] and one of its secant lines.  For explicit details of the method used, see [[Archimedes' use of infinitesimals]].

===''Geometry''===

*[[Andrei Petrovich Kiselyov|Andrei Kiselyov]]
'''Publication data:''' 1892

The most widely used and influential textbook in Russian mathematics. (See Kiselyov page and [http://www.maa.org/reviews/KiselevGeomI.html MAA review].)

===''[[A Course of Pure Mathematics]]''===

* [[G. H. Hardy]]

A classic textbook in introductory [[mathematical analysis]], written by [[G. H. Hardy]]. It was first published in 1908, and went through many editions. It was intended to help reform mathematics teaching in the UK, and more specifically in the [[University of Cambridge]], and in schools preparing pupils to study mathematics at Cambridge.  As such, it was aimed directly at "scholarship level" students — the top 10% to 20% by ability. The book contains a large number of difficult problems. The content covers introductory [[calculus]] and the theory of [[infinite series]].

===''[[Moderne Algebra]]''===

* [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|B. L. van der Waerden]]
The first introductory textbook (graduate level) expounding the abstract approach to algebra developed by Emil Artin and Emmy Noether.  First published in German in 1931 by Springer Verlag.  A later English translation was published in 1949 by [[Frederick Ungar Publishing Company]].

===''[[Algebra (book)|Algebra]]''===

* [[Saunders Mac Lane]] and [[Garrett Birkhoff]]
A definitive introductory text for abstract algebra using a [[Category theory|category theoretic]] approach. Both a rigorous introduction from first principles, and a reasonably comprehensive survey of the field.

===''Calculus, Vol. 1''===

* [[Tom M. Apostol]]

===''[[Algebraic Geometry (book)|Algebraic Geometry]]''===

* [[Robin Hartshorne]]
The first comprehensive introductory (graduate level) text in algebraic geometry that used the language of schemes and cohomology.  Published in 1977, it lacks aspects of the scheme language which are nowadays considered central, like the [[hom functor|functor of points]].

===''[[Naive Set Theory (book)|Naive Set Theory]]''===

* [[Paul Halmos]]
An undergraduate introduction to not-very-naive set theory which has lasted for decades.  It is still considered by many to be the best introduction to set theory for beginners.  While the title states that it is naive, which is usually taken to mean without axioms, the book does introduce all the axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and gives correct and rigorous definitions for basic objects.  Where it differs from a "true" axiomatic set theory book is its character: There are no long-winded discussions of axiomatic minutiae, and there is next to nothing about topics like [[large cardinal]]s.  Instead it aims, and succeeds, in being intelligible to someone who has never thought about set theory before.

===''[[Cardinal and Ordinal Numbers]]''===

* [[Wacław Sierpiński]]
The ''nec plus ultra'' reference for basic facts about cardinal and ordinal numbers.  If you have a question about the cardinality of sets occurring in everyday mathematics, the first place to look is this book, first published in the early 1950s but based on the author's lectures on the subject over the preceding 40 years.

===''[[Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs]]''===

* [[Kenneth Kunen]]
This book is not really for beginners, but graduate students with some minimal experience in set theory and formal logic will find it a valuable self-teaching tool, particularly in regard to [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]]. It is far easier to read than a true reference work such as Jech, ''Set Theory''. It may be the best textbook from which to learn forcing, though it has the disadvantage that the exposition of forcing relies somewhat on the earlier presentation of Martin's axiom.

===''Topologie''===

* [[Pavel Sergeevich Alexandrov]]
* [[Heinz Hopf]]
First published round 1935, this text was a pioneering "reference" text book in topology, already incorporating many modern concepts from set-theoretic topology, homological algebra and homotopy theory.

===''General Topology''===

* [[John L. Kelley]]
First published in 1955, for many years the only introductory graduate level textbook in the US, teaching the basics of point set, as opposed to algebraic, topology. Prior to this the material, essential for advanced study in many fields, was only available in bits and pieces from texts on other topics or journal articles.

===''Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint''===

* [[John Milnor]]
This short book introduces the main concepts of differential topology in Milnor's lucid and concise style.  While the book does not cover very much, its topics are explained beautifully in a way that illuminates all their details.

===''[[Number Theory, An approach through history from Hammurapi to Legendre]]''===

* [[André Weil]]
An historical study of number theory, written by one of the 20th century's greatest researchers in the field.  The book covers some thirty six centuries of arithmetical work but the bulk of it is devoted to a detailed study and exposition of the work of Fermat, Euler, Lagrange, and Legendre.  The author wishes to take the reader into the workshop of his subjects to share their successes and failures. A rare opportunity to see the historical development of a subject through the mind of one of its greatest practitioners.

===''An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers''===

* [[G. H. Hardy]] and [[E. M. Wright]]
''[[An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers]]'' was first published in 1938, and is still in print, with the latest edition being the 6th (2008). It is likely that almost every serious student and researcher into number theory has consulted this book, and probably has it on their bookshelf. It was not intended to be a textbook, and is rather an introduction to a wide range of differing areas of number theory which would now almost certainly be covered in separate volumes. The writing style has long been regarded as exemplary, and the approach gives insight into a variety of areas without requiring much more than a good grounding in algebra, calculus and complex numbers.

===''[[Foundations of Differential Geometry]]''===

*[[Shoshichi Kobayashi]] and [[Katsumi Nomizu]]

===''Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry I''===

===''Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry II''===

* [[Claire Voisin]]

==Popular writings==

===''Gödel, Escher, Bach''===

* [[Douglas Hofstadter]]
''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]: an Eternal Golden Braid'' is a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, first published in 1979 by Basic Books.
It is a book about how the creative achievements of logician Kurt Gödel, artist M. C. Escher and composer Johann Sebastian Bach interweave. As the author states: "I realized that to me, Gödel and Escher and Bach were only shadows cast in different directions by some central solid essence. I tried to reconstruct the central object, and came up with this book."

===''The World of Mathematics''===

*  [[James R. Newman]]
''[[The World of Mathematics]]'' was specially designed to make mathematics more accessible to the inexperienced. It comprises nontechnical essays on every aspect of the vast subject, including articles by and about scores of eminent mathematicians, as well as literary figures, economists, biologists, and many other eminent thinkers. Includes the work of Archimedes, Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Gregor Mendel, Edmund Halley, Jonathan Swift, John Maynard Keynes, Henri Poincaré, Lewis Carroll, George Boole, Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead, John von Neumann, and many others. In addition, an informative commentary by distinguished scholar James R. Newman precedes each essay or group of essays, explaining their relevance and context in the history and development of mathematics. Originally published in 1956, it does not include many of the exciting discoveries of the later years of the 20th century but it has no equal as a general historical survey of important topics and applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11629">[[Function (mathematics)|Functions]] can be identified according to the properties they have. These properties describe the functions behaviour under certain conditions. A parabola is a specific type of function.

==Relative to [[set theory]]==
These properties concern the [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]], the [[codomain]] and the [[Range (mathematics)|range]] of functions.
* [[Injective function]]: has a distinct value for each distinct argument. Also called an injection or, sometimes, one-to-one function.In other words, every element of the function's codomain is the image of at most one element of its domain.
* [[Surjective function]]: has a [[preimage]] for every element of the [[codomain]], i.e. the codomain equals the range. Also called a surjection or [[onto function]].
* [[Bijective function]]: is both an [[injective function|injection]] and a [[surjection]], and thus [[Inverse function|invertible]].
* [[Identity function]]: maps any given element to itself.
* [[Constant function]]: has a fixed value regardless of arguments.
* [[Empty function]]: whose domain equals the [[empty set]].
* [[Set function]]: whose input is a set.

==Relative to an operator (c.q. a [[group theory|group]] or other [[Mathematical structure|structure]])==
These properties concern how the function is affected by [[arithmetic]] operations on its operand.

The following are special examples of a [[homomorphism]] on a [[binary operation]]:
* [[Additive map|Additive function]]: preserves the addition operation: ''f''(''x'' + ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') + ''f''(''y'').
* [[Multiplicative function]]: preserves the multiplication operation: ''f''(''xy'') = ''f''(''x'')''f''(''y'').

Relative to [[negation]]:
* [[Even function]]: is symmetric with respect to the ''Y''-axis. Formally, for each ''x'': ''f''(''x'') = ''f''(&amp;minus;''x'').
* [[Odd function]]: is symmetric with respect to the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]. Formally, for each ''x'': ''f''(&amp;minus;''x'') = &amp;minus;''f''(''x'').

Relative to a binary operation and an [[order theory|order]]:
* [[Subadditive function]]: for which the value of ''f''(''x''+''y'') is less than or equal to ''f''(''x'') + ''f''(''y'').

Relative to topology and order:
* [[Semicontinuous function]]: upper or lower semicontinuous.
* [[Continuous_function#Directional_and_semi-continuity|Right-continuous function]]: no jump when the limit point is approached from the right. Left-continuous function: similarly.
* [[Locally bounded]] function: bounded around every point.

==Relative to an ordering==
* [[Monotonic function]]: does not reverse ordering of any pair.
* Strict [[Monotonic function]]: preserves the given order.

==Relative to the real/complex numbers==
* [[Linear function]]; also [[affine function]].
* [[Convex function]]: line segment between any two points on the graph lies above the graph. Also [[concave function]].
* [[Arithmetic function]]: A function from the positive [[integers]] into the [[complex number]]s.
* [[Analytic function]]: Can be defined locally by a [[Convergent series|convergent]] [[power series]].
* [[Quasi-analytic function]]: not analytic, but still, locally determined by its derivatives at a point.
* [[Differentiable function]]: Has a [[derivative]].
* [[Continuously differentiable function]]: differentiable, with continuous derivative.

* [[Entire function]]: A [[holomorphic function]] whose domain is the entire [[complex number|complex plane]].
* [[Harmonic function]]: its value at the center of a ball is equal to the average value on the surface of the ball [[Harmonic function#The mean value property|(mean value property)]]. Also [[subharmonic function]] and [[superharmonic function]].
* [[Elementary function]]: composition of arithmetic operations, exponentials, logarithms, constants, and solutions of algebraic equations.
* [[Special functions]]: non-elementary functions that have established names and notations due to their importance.
* [[Trigonometric functions]]: relate the angles of a triangle to the lengths of its sides.
* [[Nowhere differentiable function]] called also [[Weierstrass function]]: continuous everywhere but not differentiable even at a single point.
* [[Fast-growing hierarchy|Fast-growing]] (or rapidly increasing) function; in particular, [[Ackermann function]].

==Relative to measurability==
* [[Measurable function]]: the preimage of each measurable set is measurable.
* [[Borel function]]: the preimage of each [[Borel set]] is a Borel set.
* [[Baire function]] called also [[Baire measurable function]]: obtained from continuous functions by transfinite iteration of the operation of forming pointwise limits of sequences of functions.

==Ways of defining functions/relation to type theory==
* [[Polynomial#Polynomial functions|Polynomial function]]: defined by evaluating a polynomial.
* [[Rational function]]: ratio of two polynomial functions. In particular, [[Möbius transformation]] called also [[Linear fractional transformation|linear fractional]] function.
* [[Algebraic function]]: defined as the root of a polynomial equation.
* [[Transcendental function]]: analytic but not algebraic. Also [[hypertranscendental function]].
* [[Composite function]]: is formed by the composition of two functions ''f'' and ''g'', by mapping ''x'' to ''f''(''g''(''x'')).
* [[Inverse function]]: is declared by "doing the reverse" of a given function (e.g. [[arcsine]] is the inverse of [[sine]]).
* [[Implicit function]]: defined implicitly by a relation between the argument(s) and the value.
* [[Piecewise function]]: is defined by different expressions at different intervals.
* [[Computable function]]: an algorithm can do the job of the function. Also [[semicomputable function]]; [[primitive recursive function]]; [[partial recursive function]].

In general, functions are often defined by specifying the name of a dependent variable, and a way of calculating what it should map to.  For this purpose, the &lt;math&gt;\mapsto&lt;/math&gt; symbol or [[Alonzo Church|Church]]'s [[lambda calculus|&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;]] is often used.  Also, sometimes mathematicians notate a function's [[domain of a function|domain]] and [[codomain]] by writing e.g. &lt;math&gt;f:A\rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;.  These notions extend directly to [[lambda calculus]] and [[type theory]], respectively.

==Higher order functions==
These are functions that operate on functions or produce other functions, see [[Higher order function]].
Examples are:
* [[Function composition]].

* [[Integral]] and [[Differential (mathematics)|Differential]] operations.
* [[Fourier transforms]].
* [[Fold (higher-order function)|Fold]] and [[Map (higher-order function)|Map]] operations.
* [[Currying]]

==Relation to category theory==

[[Category theory]] is a branch of mathematics that formalizes the notion of a special function via arrows or [[morphisms]].  A [[category (mathematics)|category]] is an algebraic object that (abstractly) consists of a class of ''objects'', and for every pair of objects, a set of ''morphisms''.  A partial (equiv. [[dependently typed]]) binary operation called [[Function composition|composition]] is provided on morphisms, every object has one special morphism from it to itself called the [[identity (mathematics)|identity]] on that object, and composition and identities are required to obey certain relations.

In a so-called [[concrete category]], the objects are associated with mathematical structures like [[set (mathematics)|sets]], [[magmas]], [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[topological spaces]], [[vector spaces]], [[metric spaces]], [[order theory|partial orders]], [[differentiable manifolds]], [[uniform spaces]], etc., and morphisms between two objects are associated with ''structure-preserving functions'' between them.  In the examples above, these would be [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], magma [[homomorphisms]], [[group homomorphisms]], ring homomorphisms, [[continuous functions]], [[linear transformations]] (or [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]), [[metric map]]s, [[monotonic function]]s, [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] functions, and [[uniformly continuous]] functions, respectively.

As an algebraic theory, one of the advantages of category theory is to enable one to prove many general results with a minimum of assumptions.  Many common notions from mathematics (e.g. [[surjective]], [[injective]], [[free object]], [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]], finite [[Group representation|representation]], [[isomorphism]]) are definable purely in category theoretic terms (cf. [[monomorphism]], [[epimorphism]]).

Category theory has been suggested as a foundation for mathematics on par with [[set theory]] and [[type theory]] (cf. [[topos]]).

[[Allegory (category theory)|Allegory theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter Freyd, Andre Scedrov (1990). Categories, Allegories. Mathematical Library Vol 39. North-Holland. {{isbn|978-0-444-70368-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; provides a generalization comparable to category theory for [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] instead of functions.

==More general objects still called functions==
* [[Dirac delta function]]: useful to describe physical phenomena such as point charges.
* [[Generalized function]]: a wide generalization of Dirac delta function, able to describe [[white noise]] etc.
* [[Multivalued function]]: one-to-many relation.
* [[Random function]]: [[Random element]] of a set of functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2571">A '''log space transducer (LST)''' is a type of [[Turing machine]] used for [[log-space reduction]]s.

A log space transducer, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, has three tapes:
* A read-only ''input'' tape.
* A read/write ''work'' tape (bounded to at most &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; symbols).
* A write-only, write-once ''output'' tape.

&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; will be designed to compute a [[log-space computable function]] &lt;math&gt;f\colon \Sigma^\ast \rightarrow \Sigma^\ast&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] of both the ''input'' and ''output'' tapes). If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is executed with &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; on its ''input'' tape, when the machine halts, it will have &lt;math&gt;f(w)&lt;/math&gt; remaining on its ''output'' tape.

A language &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq \Sigma^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is said to be [[log-space reduction|log-space reducible]] to a language &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq \Sigma^\ast&lt;/math&gt; if there exists a [[log-space computable function]], &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, which will convert an input from problem &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; into an input to problem &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. I.E. &lt;math&gt;w \in A \iff f(w) \in B&lt;/math&gt;.

This seems like a rather convoluted idea, but it has two useful properties that are desirable for a reduction:
# The property of transitivity holds. (A reduces to B and B reduces to C implies A reduces to C).
# If A reduces to B, and B is in [[L (complexity)|L]], then we know A is in [[L (complexity)|L]].

Transitivity holds because it is possible to feed the output tape of one reducer (A&amp;rarr;B) to another (B&amp;rarr;C). At first glance, this seems incorrect because the A&amp;rarr;C reducer needs to store the output tape from the A&amp;rarr;B reducer onto the work tape in order to feed it into the B&amp;rarr;C reducer, but this is not true. Each time the B&amp;rarr;C reducer needs to access its input tape, the A&amp;rarr;C reducer can re-run the A&amp;rarr;B reducer, and so the output of the A&amp;rarr;B reducer never needs to be stored entirely at once.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3943">In mathematics, the '''Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction''' or '''Lyapunov–Schmidt construction''' is used to study solutions to nonlinear equations in the case when the [[implicit function theorem]] does not work. It permits the reduction of infinite-dimensional equations in Banach spaces to finite-dimensional equations. It is named after [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]] and [[Erhard Schmidt]].

==Problem setup==
Let

:&lt;math&gt; f(x,\lambda)=0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

be the given nonlinear equation,  &lt;math&gt; X,\Lambda, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt; are
[[Banach space]]s (&lt;math&gt;\Lambda &lt;/math&gt; is the parameter space). &lt;math&gt; f(x,\lambda) &lt;/math&gt; is the
&lt;math&gt; C^p &lt;/math&gt;-map from a neighborhood of some point &lt;math&gt; (x_0,\lambda_0)\in X\times \Lambda &lt;/math&gt; to
&lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt; and the equation is satisfied at this point

:&lt;math&gt; f(x_0,\lambda_0)=0. &lt;/math&gt;

For the case when the linear operator &lt;math&gt; f_x(x,\lambda) &lt;/math&gt; is invertible, the [[implicit function theorem]] assures that there exists
a solution &lt;math&gt; x(\lambda) &lt;/math&gt; satisfying the equation &lt;math&gt; f(x(\lambda),\lambda)=0 &lt;/math&gt; at least locally close to &lt;math&gt; \lambda_0 &lt;/math&gt;.

In the opposite case, when the linear operator &lt;math&gt; f_x(x,\lambda) &lt;/math&gt; is non-invertible, the Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction can be applied in the following
way.

==Assumptions==

One assumes that the operator  &lt;math&gt; f_x(x,\lambda) &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Fredholm operator]].

&lt;math&gt; \ker f_x (x_0,\lambda_0)=X_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; X_1 &lt;/math&gt; has finite dimension.

The [[range (mathematics)|range]] of this operator &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ran} f_x (x_0,\lambda_0)=Y_1 &lt;/math&gt; has finite [[co-dimension]] and
is a closed subspace in &lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt;.

Without loss of generality, one can assume that &lt;math&gt; (x_0,\lambda_0)=(0,0). &lt;/math&gt;

==Lyapunov–Schmidt construction==

Let us split  &lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt; into the direct product &lt;math&gt; Y= Y_1 \oplus Y_2 &lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt; \dim Y_2 &lt; \infty &lt;/math&gt;.

Let  &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; be the [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection operator]] onto  &lt;math&gt; Y_1 &lt;/math&gt;.

Let us consider also the direct product &lt;math&gt; X= X_1 \oplus X_2 &lt;/math&gt;.

Applying the operators &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; I-Q &lt;/math&gt; to the original  equation, one obtains the equivalent system

:&lt;math&gt; Qf(x,\lambda)=0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; (I-Q)f(x,\lambda)=0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt; x_1\in X_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x_2 \in X_2 &lt;/math&gt;, then the first equation

:&lt;math&gt; Qf(x_1+x_2,\lambda)=0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

can be solved with respect to &lt;math&gt; x_2 &lt;/math&gt; by applying the implicit function theorem to the operator

:&lt;math&gt; Qf(x_1+x_2,\lambda): \quad X_2\times(X_1\times\Lambda)\to Y_1 \, &lt;/math&gt;

(now the conditions of the implicit function theorem are fulfilled).

Thus, there exists a unique solution &lt;math&gt; x_2(x_1,\lambda) &lt;/math&gt;  satisfying

:&lt;math&gt; Qf(x_1+x_2(x_1,\lambda),\lambda)=0. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Now substituting &lt;math&gt; x_2(x_1,\lambda) &lt;/math&gt; into the second equation, one obtains the final finite-dimensional equation

:&lt;math&gt; (I-Q)f(x_1+x_2(x_1,\lambda),\lambda)=0. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Indeed, the last equation is now finite-dimensional, since the range of &lt;math&gt; (I-Q) &lt;/math&gt; is finite-dimensional. This equation is now to be solved with respect to &lt;math&gt; x_1 &lt;/math&gt;, which is finite-dimensional, and parameters :&lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12680">In the [[mathematics of paper folding]], '''map folding''' and '''stamp folding''' are two problems of counting the number of ways that a piece of paper can be folded. In the stamp folding problem, the paper is a strip of stamps with creases between them, and the folds must lie on the creases. In the map folding problem, the paper is a map, divided by creases into rectangles, and the folds must again lie only along these creases.

==Labeled stamps==
In the stamp folding problem, the paper to be folded is a strip of square or rectangular stamps, separated by creases, and the stamps can only be folded along those creases.
In one commonly considered version of the problem, each stamp is considered to be distinguishable from each other stamp, so two foldings of a strip of stamps are considered equivalent only when they have the same vertical sequence of stamps.&lt;ref name="legendre"/&gt;
For example, there are six ways to fold a strip of three different stamps:

[[Image:Stampfoldings1x3.png]]

These include all six permutations of the stamps, but for more than three stamps not all permutations are possible. If, for a permutation {{mvar|p}}, there are two numbers {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}} with the same [[parity (mathematics)|parity]] such that the four numbers {{mvar|i}}, {{mvar|j}}, {{math|''i'' + 1}}, and {{math|''j'' + 1}} appear in {{mvar|p}} in that [[cyclic order]], then {{mvar|p}} cannot be folded. The parity condition implies that the creases between stamps {{mvar|i}} and {{math|''i'' + 1}}, and between stamps {{mvar|j}} and {{math|''j'' + 1}}, appear on the same side of the stack of folded stamps, but the cyclic ordering condition implies that these two creases cross each other, a physical impossibility. For instance, the four-element permutation 1324 cannot be folded, because it has this forbidden pattern with {{math|1=''i'' = 1}} and {{math|1=''j'' = 3}}. All remaining permutations, without this pattern, can be folded.&lt;ref name="legendre"/&gt;
The number of different ways to fold a strip of {{mvar|n}} stamps is given by the sequence
:1, 2, 6, 16, 50, 144, 462, 1392, 4536, 14060, 46310, 146376, 485914, 1557892, 5202690, ... {{OEIS|A000136}}.
These numbers are always divisible by {{math|''n''}} (because a [[cyclic permutation]] of a foldable stamp sequence is always itself foldable),&lt;ref name="legendre"&gt;{{citation

The stamp folding problem usually considers only the number of possible folded states of the strip of stamps, without considering whether it is possible to physically construct the fold by a sequence of moves starting from an unfolded strip of stamps. However, according to the solution of the [[carpenter's rule problem]], every folded state can be constructed (or equivalently, can be unfolded).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Unlabeled stamps==
In another variation of the stamp folding problem, the strip of stamps is considered to be blank, so that it is not possible to tell one of its ends from the other, and two foldings are considered distinct only when they have different shapes. Turning a folded strip upside-down or back-to-front is not considered to change its shape, so three stamps have only two foldings, an S-curve and a spiral.&lt;ref name="legendre"/&gt; More generally, the numbers of foldings with this definition are
:1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 38, 120, 353, 1148, 3527, 11622, 36627, 121622, 389560, 1301140, 4215748, ... {{OEIS|A001011}}

==Maps==
Map folding is the question of how many ways there are to fold a rectangular map along its creases, allowing each crease to form either a mountain or a valley fold. It differs from stamp folding in that it includes both vertical and horizontal creases, rather than only creases in a single direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 14
 | year = 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are eight ways to fold a 2 × 2 map along its creases, counting each different vertical sequence of folded squares as a distinct way of folding the map:&lt;ref name="gardner"&gt;{{citation

[[Image:MapFoldings-2x2.png|350 px]]

However, the general problem of counting the number of ways to fold a map remains unsolved. The numbers of ways of folding an {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} map are known only for {{math|''n'' ≤ 5}}. They are:
:1, 8, 1368, 300608, 186086600 {{OEIS|A001418}}.

==Complexity==
{{unsolved|mathematics|Given a mountain-valley assignment for the creases of a map, is it possible to test efficiently whether it can be folded flat?}}
The map folding and stamp folding problems are related to a problem in the [[mathematics of origami]] of whether a square with a crease pattern can be folded to a flat figure.
If a folding direction (either a [[mountain fold]] or a [[valley fold]]) is assigned to each crease of a strip of stamps, it is possible to test whether the result can be folded flat in [[polynomial time]].&lt;ref name="abddmss"/&gt;

For the same problem on a map (divided into rectangles by creases with assigned directions) it is unknown whether a polynomial time folding algorithm exists in general,
although a polynomial algorithm is known for {{math|2 × ''n''}} maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Map folding|first=Thomas D.|last=Morgan|series=Master's thesis|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science|date=May 21, 2012|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/77030}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a restricted case where the map is to be folded by a sequence of "simple" folds, which fold the paper along a single line, the problem is polynomial.
Some extensions of the problem, for instance to non-rectangular sheets of paper, are [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref name="abddmss"&gt;{{citation

Even for a one-dimensional strip of stamps, with its creases already labeled as mountain or valley folds, it is [[NP-hard]] to find a way to fold it that minimizes the maximum number of stamps that lie between the two stamps of any crease.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7261">In [[theoretical computer science]], a '''Markov algorithm''' is a [[string rewriting system]] that uses [[Formal grammar|grammar]]-like rules to operate on [[string (computer science)|strings]] of symbols. Markov algorithms have been shown to be [[Turing-complete]], which means that they are suitable as a general model of [[computation]] and can represent any [[mathematical expression]] from its simple notation. Markov algorithms are named after the Soviet mathematician [[Andrey Markov, Jr.]]

[[Refal]] is a [[programming language]] based on Markov algorithms.

==Description==

Normal algorithms are verbal, that is intended to be applied to words in different alphabets.

Definition of any normal algorithm consists of two parts: the definition of the ''alphabet'' algorithm (the algorithm will be applied to words of these alphabet symbols), and the definition of its ''scheme''. Scheme normal algorithm is a finite ordered set of so-called ''substitution formulas'', each of which can be ''simple'' or ''final''. A simple formula substitutions are called words such as &lt;math&gt;L\to D&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; – are two arbitrary words in the alphabet of the algorithm (called, respectively, the left and right side of the formula substitution). Similarly, the final substitution formulas are called words of the form &lt;math&gt;L\to\cdot D&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; – are two arbitrary words in the alphabet of the algorithm. This assumes that the auxiliary characters &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\to\cdot&lt;/math&gt; do not belong to the alphabet of the algorithm (otherwise an executable their role divider left and right sides should select the other two letters).

An example of a normal algorithm scheme in five-letter alphabet &lt;math&gt;|*abc&lt;/math&gt; can serve the following scheme:

: &lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{matrix} |b&amp;\to&amp; ba|\\ ab&amp;\to&amp; ba\\ b&amp;\to&amp;\\ {*}|&amp;\to&amp; b*&amp; \\ {*}&amp;\to&amp; c&amp; \\
|c&amp;\to&amp; c\\ ac&amp;\to&amp; c|\\ c&amp;\to\cdot\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

The process of applying the normal algorithm to an arbitrary word &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; in the alphabet of this algorithm is a discrete sequence of elementary steps, consisting of the following. Let’s assume that &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt; is the word obtained in the previous step of the algorithm (or the original word &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, if the current step is the first). If among formulas of substitution there is no left-hand side of which would be included in the &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt;, then the work of the algorithm is considered completed, and the result of this work is considered to be the word &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt;. Otherwise, including the substitution of the left side of which is included in the &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt;, the very first part is selected. If the substitution formula looks like &lt;math&gt;L\to\cdot D&lt;/math&gt;, then out of all of possible representations of the word &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt; that looks like &lt;math&gt;RLS&lt;/math&gt; it is chosen one &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, which is the shortest. Then the work of the algorithm is considered completed with the result &lt;math&gt;RDS&lt;/math&gt;. However, if this substitution formula looks like &lt;math&gt;L\to D&lt;/math&gt;, then out of all of possible representations of the word &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt; in the form of &lt;math&gt;RLS&lt;/math&gt; it is chosen one, in which &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; – the shortest, after which the word &lt;math&gt;RDS&lt;/math&gt; is considered to be the result of the current step, subject to further processing in the next step.

For example, during the process of applying the algorithm to the scheme diagram above the word &lt;math&gt;|*||&lt;/math&gt; consistently emerging the words &lt;math&gt;|b*|&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;ba|*|&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a|*|&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a|b*&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;aba|*&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;baa|*&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;aa|*&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;aa|c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;aac&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;ac|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c||&lt;/math&gt;, after which the algorithm stops with the result &lt;math&gt;.||&lt;/math&gt;    

For other examples, see below.

Any normal algorithm is equivalent to some [[Turing machine]], and vice versa{{snd}}any [[Turing machine]] is equivalent to some normal algorithm. A version of the [[Church-Turing thesis]] formulated in relation to the normal algorithm is called the "principle of normalization."

Normal algorithms have proved to be a convenient means for the construction of many sections of [[constructive mathematics]]. Moreover, inherent in the definition of a normal algorithm used in a number of ideas aimed at handling symbolic information programming languages{{snd}}for example, in [[Refal]].

==Algorithm==

The ''Rules'' is a sequence of pair of strings, usually presented in the form of ''pattern'' → ''replacement''. Each rule may be either ordinary or terminating.

Given an ''input'' string: 

#Check the Rules in order from top to bottom to see whether any of the ''patterns'' can be found in the ''input'' string.
#If none is found, the algorithm stops.
#If one (or more) is found, use '''the first''' of them to replace the leftmost occurrence of matched text in the ''input'' string with its ''replacement''.
#If the rule just applied was a terminating one, the algorithm stops.
#Go to step 1.

Note that after each rule application the search starts over from the first rule.

==Example==
The following example shows the basic operation of a Markov algorithm.

===Rules===
#"A" -&gt; "apple"
#"B" -&gt; "bag"
#"S" -&gt; "shop"
#"T" -&gt; "the"
#"the shop" -&gt; "my brother"
#"a never used" -&gt; '''.'''"terminating rule"

===Symbol string===
"I bought a B of As from T S."

===Execution===
If the algorithm is applied to the above example, the Symbol string will change in the following manner.

#"I bought a B of apples from T S."
#"I bought a bag of apples from T S."
#"I bought a bag of apples from T shop."
#"I bought a bag of apples from the shop."
#"I bought a bag of apples from my brother."

The algorithm will then terminate.

==Another Example==

These rules give a more interesting example. They rewrite binary numbers to their unary counterparts. For example: 101 will be rewritten to a string of 5 consecutive bars.

===Rules===
#"|0" -&gt; "0||"
#"1" -&gt; "0|"
#"0" -&gt; ""

===Symbol string===
"101"

===Execution===
If the algorithm is applied to the above example, it will terminate after the following steps.

#"101"
#"0|01"
#"00||1"
#"00||0|"
#"00|0|||"
#"000|||||"
#"00|||||"
#"0|||||"
#"|||||"

[[Andrew Wiles]] proved the modularity theorem for [[semistable elliptic curve]]s, which was enough to imply [[Fermat's last theorem]]. Later, [[Christophe Breuil]], [[Brian Conrad]], [[Fred Diamond]] and [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]] extended Wiles' techniques to prove the full modularity theorem in 2001. The modularity theorem is a special case of more general conjectures due to [[Robert Langlands]]. The [[Langlands program]] seeks to attach an [[automorphic form]] or [[automorphic representation]] (a suitable generalization of a modular form) to more general objects of arithmetic algebraic geometry, such as to every elliptic curve over a [[number field]].  Most cases of these extended conjectures have not yet been proved.  However,  {{harvtxt|Freitas|Le Hung|Siksek|2015}} proved that elliptic curves defined over real quadratic fields are modular.

==Statement==
The [[theorem]] states that any [[elliptic curve]] over '''Q''' can be obtained via a [[rational map]] with [[integer]] [[coefficient]]s from the [[classical modular curve]] &lt;math&gt;X_0(N)&lt;/math&gt; for some integer ''N''; this is a curve with integer coefficients with an explicit definition. This mapping is called a modular parametrization of level ''N''.  If ''N'' is the smallest integer for which such a parametrization can be found (which by the modularity theorem itself is now known to be a number called the ''[[conductor of an elliptic curve|conductor]]''), then the parametrization may be defined in terms of a mapping generated by a particular kind of modular form of weight two and level ''N'', a normalized [[newform]] with integer ''q''-expansion, followed if need be by an [[Elliptic curve#Isogeny|isogeny]].

The modularity theorem implies a closely related analytic statement: to an elliptic curve ''E'' over '''Q''' we may attach a corresponding [[L-series of an elliptic curve|L-series]]. The ''L''-series is a [[Dirichlet series]], commonly written

:&lt;math&gt;L(E, s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a_n}{n^s}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[generating function]] of the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; is then

:&lt;math&gt;f(E, q) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n q^n.&lt;/math&gt;

If we make the substitution

:&lt;math&gt;q = e^{2 \pi i \tau}&lt;/math&gt;

we see that we have written the [[Fourier series|Fourier expansion]] of a function &lt;math&gt;f(E, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; of the complex variable ''τ'', so the coefficients of the ''q''-series are also thought of as the Fourier coefficients of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. The function obtained in this way is, remarkably, a [[cusp form]] of weight two and level ''N'' and is also an eigenform (an eigenvector of all [[Hecke operator]]s); this is the '''Hasse–Weil conjecture''', which follows from the modularity theorem.

Some  modular forms of weight two, in turn, correspond to  [[holomorphic differential]]s for an elliptic curve. The Jacobian of the modular curve can (up to isogeny) be written as a product of irreducible [[Abelian varieties]], corresponding to Hecke eigenforms of weight 2. The 1-dimensional factors are elliptic curves (there can also be higher-dimensional factors, so not all Hecke eigenforms correspond to rational elliptic curves). The curve obtained by finding the corresponding cusp form, and then constructing a curve from it, is [[Elliptic curve#Isogeny|isogenous]] to the original curve (but not, in general, isomorphic to it).

==History==
{{harvs|txt|authorlink=Yutaka  Taniyama|last=Taniyama|first=Yutaka|year=1956}} stated a preliminary (slightly incorrect) version of the conjecture  at the 1955 international symposium on algebraic number theory in [[Tokyo]] and [[Nikkō, Tochigi|Nikkō]].  [[Goro Shimura]] and Taniyama worked on improving its rigor until 1957.   {{harvs|txt|authorlink=André Weil|last=Weil|first=André|year= 1967}} rediscovered the conjecture, and showed that it would follow from the (conjectured) functional equations for some twisted L-series of the elliptic curve; this was the first serious evidence that the conjecture might be true.  Weil also showed that the conductor of the elliptic curve should be the level of the corresponding modular form. The Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture became a part of the [[Langlands program]].

The conjecture attracted considerable interest when {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Gerhard Frey|last=Frey|first=Gerhard|year=1986}} suggested that the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture implies [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. He did this by attempting to show that any counterexample to Fermat's Last Theorem would imply the existence of at least one non-modular elliptic curve. This argument was completed when {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Jean-Pierre Serre|last=Serre|first=Jean-Pierre|year=1987}} identified a missing link (now known as the [[epsilon conjecture]] or Ribet's theorem) in Frey's original work, followed two years later by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Ken Ribet|last=Ribet|first=Ken|year=1990}}'s completion of a proof of the epsilon conjecture.

Even after gaining serious attention, the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture was seen by contemporary mathematicians as extraordinarily difficult to prove or perhaps even inaccessible to proof {{harv|Singh|1997|pp=203–205, 223, 226}}. For example, Wiles' ex-supervisor [[John H. Coates|John Coates]] states that it seemed "impossible to actually prove", and Ken Ribet considered himself "one of the vast majority of people who believed [it] was completely inaccessible".

{{harvs|txt|authorlink=Andrew Wiles|last=Wiles|year=1995}}, with some help from [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]], proved  the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture for all [[semistable elliptic curve]]s, which he used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, and the full Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture was finally proved by {{harvtxt|Diamond|1996}}, {{harvtxt|Conrad|Diamond|Taylor|1999}}, and {{harvtxt|Breuil|Conrad|Diamond|Taylor|2001}} who, building on Wiles' work, incrementally chipped away at the remaining cases until the full result was proved. 
{{further|Fermat's Last Theorem|Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem}}

Once fully proven, the conjecture became known as the modularity theorem.

Several theorems in number theory similar to Fermat's Last Theorem follow from the modularity theorem. For example: no cube can be written as a sum of two [[coprime]] ''n''-th powers, ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3. (The case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 was already known by [[Euler]].)

'''Naum Ilyich Akhiezer''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Нау́м Ильи́ч Ахие́зер}}; 6 March 1901 – 3 June 1980) was a Soviet mathematician of Jewish origin, known for his works in [[approximation theory]] and the theory of [[differential operator|differential]] and [[integral operator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Akhiezer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a100&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/r3u763945r176407/fulltext.pdf NAUM IL’ICH AKHIEZER (ON THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS BIRTH), by V.

He is the brother of the theoretical physicist [[Aleksander Akhiezer]].

==Biography==
Naum Akhiezer was born in [[Cherykaw]] (now in [[Belarus]]). He studied in the Kiev Institute of Public Education (now [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv]]). In 1928, he defended his PhD thesis "Aerodynamical Investigations" under the supervision of [[Dmitry Grave]]. From 1928 to 1933, he worked at the [[Kiev University]] and at the [[National Aviation University|Kiev Aviation Institute]].

In 1933, Naum Akhiezer moved to [[Kharkiv]]. From 1933 to his death, except for the years of war and evacuation, he was a professor at [[Kharkov University]] and at other institutes in Kharkiv. From 1935 to 1940 and from 1947 to 1950 he was director of the Kharkov Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. For many years he headed the [[Kharkov Mathematical Society]].

==Work==
Akhiezer obtained important results in [[approximation theory]] (in particular, on extremal problems, [[constructive function theory]], and the [[Moment problem|problem of moments]]), where he masterly applied the methods of the geometric theory of [[functions of a complex variable]] (especially, [[conformal mapping]]s and the theory of [[Riemann surface]]s) and of [[functional analysis]].&lt;ref name=a100/&gt;&lt;ref name=lyubich/&gt; He found the fundamental connection between the inverse problem for important classes of differential and finite difference operators of the second order with a finite number of gaps in the spectrum, and the Jacobi inversion problem for [[Abelian integral]]s.&lt;ref name=lyubich/&gt; This connection led to explicit solutions of the inverse problem for the so-called ''finite-gap operators''.

The '''neocognitron''' is a hierarchical, multilayered [[artificial neural network]] proposed by Kunihiko Fukushima in the 1980s. It has been used for [[Handwriting recognition|handwritten character recognition]] and other [[pattern recognition]] tasks, and served as the inspiration for [[convolutional neural network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Yann |last1=LeCun |first2=Yoshua |last2=Bengio |first3=Geoffrey |last3=Hinton |title=Deep learning |journal=Nature |volume=521 |issue=7553 |year=2015 |pages=436–444 |doi=10.1038/nature14539 |pmid=26017442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neocognitron was inspired by the model proposed by [[Hubel]] &amp; [[Torsten Wiesel|Wiesel]] in 1959. They found two types of cells in the visual primary cortex called ''[[simple cell]]'' and ''[[complex cell]]'', and also proposed a cascading model of these two types of cells for use in pattern recognition tasks.&lt;ref&gt;

The neocognitron is a natural extension of these cascading models. The neocognitron consists of multiple types of cells, the most important of which are called ''S-cells'' and ''C-cells.''&lt;ref&gt;Fukushima 1987, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The local features are extracted by S-cells, and these features' deformation, such as local shifts, are tolerated by C-cells. Local features in the input are integrated gradually and classified in the higher layers.&lt;ref&gt;Fukushima 1987, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of local feature integration is found in several other models, such as the ''[[LeNet]]'' model and the ''[[Scale-invariant feature transform|SIFT]]'' model.

There are various kinds of neocognitron.&lt;ref&gt;Fukushima 2007&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some types of neocognitron can detect multiple patterns in the same input by using backward signals to achieve [[selective attention]].&lt;ref&gt;Fukushima 1987, pp.81, 85&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oracle Spatial and Graph''', formerly Oracle Spatial, forms a separately-licensed option component of the [[Oracle Database]]. The spatial features in Oracle Spatial and Graph aid users in managing geographic and location-data in a native type within an Oracle database, potentially supporting a wide range of applications — from [[automated mapping]], [[facilities management]], and [[geographic information systems]] ([[AM/FM/GIS]]), to wireless location services and location-enabled [[e-business]]. The graph features in Oracle Spatial and Graph include Oracle Network Data Model (NDM) graphs used in traditional network applications in major [[Transport network|transportation]], telcos, utilities and energy organizations and [[resource description framework|RDF]] semantic graphs used in [[social network]]s and social interactions and in linking disparate data sets to address requirements from the research, health sciences, finance, media and intelligence communities.

==Components==

The geospatial feature of Oracle Spatial and Graph provides a [[SQL]] [[logical schema|schema]] and functions that facilitate the storage, retrieval, update, and query of collections of [[Space|spatial]] features in an Oracle database. (The spatial component of a spatial feature consists of the [[geometric]] representation of its shape in some [[coordinate space]] — referred to as its "geometry".)

===Geospatial data features===

The Oracle Spatial geospatial data features consist of:

* a schema - MDSYS (as in "multi-dimensional system"&lt;ref&gt;

* [[Open Geospatial Consortium]]-compliant [[Web Service]]s for geocoding, routing, mapping, business-directory, catalog, and geospatial feature transactions

===Network Data Model===

The [[Network (mathematics)|Network]] Data Model feature is a property graph model used to model and analyze physical and logical networks used in industries such as transportation, logistics, and utilities. Its features include:
* Persistent management of the network connectivity in the database
* A data model for representing capabilities or objects (modeled as [[node (networking)|node]]s and [[data link|link]]s) in a network with a PL/SQL API for managing network data. 
* User-determined link and node properties, such as costs and restrictions, including temporal properties.
* Association of real world objects with network elements to simplify application development and maintenance. 
* A Java API for in-memory network path analytics, including shortest path, nearest neighbors, within cost, and reachability, with partitioned loading of large networks into memory.

===RDF semantic===

The RDF [[Semantic Web|Semantic]] Graph feature supports the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] standards. It provides RDF data management, querying and inferencing that are commonly used in a variety of applications ranging from semantic [[data integration]] to [[social network analysis]] and [[linked open data]] applications. Its features include:
* An RDF [[triple store]] and [[ontology]] management with automatic partitoning and data compression.
* Proven scalability to over 54 billion [[Semantic triple|triples]] (LUBM 200K benchmark) with scalability to the 8 petabyte limit of Oracle Database. 
* High performance bulk loading with Oracle Database parallel and direct path loading and loading through Jena.
* SPARQL and SQL parallel querying and updating of RDF graphs with [[SPARQL]] 1.1, SPARQL endpoint web services, SPARQL/Update, Java APIs with open source Apache Jena &amp; Sesame, SQL queries with embedded SPARQL graph patterns, SQL insert/update.
* Ontology-assisted querying of table data using SQL operators to expand SQL relational queries with related terms for more comprehensive results.
* Native inferencing with parallel, incremental and secure operation for scalable reasoning with RDFS, [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL 2 RL/EL), [[Simple Knowledge Organization System]] (SKOS), user-defined rules, user-defined inference extensions, and an extensibility framework to plug-in special purpose reasoners, such as PelletDB, TrOWL.
* GeoSPARQL support for storing / querying spatial data in RDF per Open GeoSpatial Consotium (OGC) specification.
* RDF views on relational data to apply semantic analysis with support for automatic (Direct Mapping) and custom (W3C R2RML language) mapping of relational data to [[RDF triple]]s.
* Triple-level security that meets the most stringent security requirements with Oracle Label Security.
* Integration with open source Apache Jena and Sesame application development environments.
* Integration with XML-based tools, such as Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE) for reporting and dashboards.
* Integration with Network Data Model graph analytics for shortest path, nearest neighbors, within cost, and reachability.

* Semantic indexing for text mining and entity analytics integrated with popular natural language processors.
* Integration with leading commercial and open source tools for querying, visualization, and ontology management.

==Availability==

Oracle Spatial and Graph is an option for Oracle Enterprise Edition, and must be licensed separately. It is not included in Oracle Standard Edition or Oracle Standard Edition One. However, the latter two editions allow the use of a subset of spatial features (called ''Oracle Locator''&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;) at no extra cost. An appendix of the ''Oracle Spatial and Graph Developer's Guide'' specifies the functions allowed in Locator.

Oracle Corporation makes a companion visualization component and web map server, Oracle Fusion Middleware MapViewer, available as a feature of Oracle [[WebLogic]] Server.

==History==

The Oracle RDBMS first incorporated spatial-data capability with a modification to Oracle 4 made by scientists working with the [[Canadian Hydrographic Service]] (CHS).  A joint development team of CHS and Oracle personnel subsequently redesigned the Oracle kernel, resulting in the "Spatial Data Option" or "SDO" for Oracle 7. (The SDO_ prefix continues in use within Oracle Spatial implementations.) The spatial indexing system for SDO involved an adaptation of [[Riemann]]ian [[hypercube]] data-structures, invoking a [[helix|helical]] spiral through 3-dimensional space, which allows n-size of features.  This also permitted a highly efficient compression of the resulting data, suitable for the [[petabyte]]-size data repositories that CHS and other major corporate users required, and also improving search and retrieval times.  The "helical hyperspatial code", or [[HHCode]], as developed by CHS and implemented by Oracle Spatial, comprises a form of [[space-filling curve]].

With Oracle 8, [[Oracle Corporation]] marketing dubbed the spatial extension simply "Oracle Spatial". The primary spatial indexing system no longer uses the [[HHCode]], but a standard [[r-tree]] index.

Since July, 2012, the option has been named Oracle Spatial and Graph to highlight the graph database capabilities in the product - Network Data Model graph introduced with Oracle Database 10g Release 1 and RDF Semantic Graph introduced with Oracle Database 10g Release 2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9264">In [[cryptography]], a '''pseudorandom permutation (PRP)''' is a function that cannot be distinguished from a [[random permutation]] (that is, a permutation selected at random with uniform probability, from the family of all permutations on the function's domain) with practical effort. An '''unpredictable permutation''' ('''UP''') ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[permutation]] whose values cannot be predicted by a fast [[randomized algorithm]]. Unpredictable permutations may be used as a [[cryptographic primitive]], a building block for cryptographic systems with more complex properties.

==Definition==
===Pseudorandom permutation===
Let ''F'' be a mapping {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; × {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; →{0,1}&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. ''F'' is a PRP if
* For any ''K'' ∈ {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''F'' is a [[bijection]] from {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.
* For any ''K'' ∈ {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;, there is an "efficient" algorithm to evaluate ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'').
* For all probabilistic polynomial-time [[advantage (cryptography)|distinguishers]] D: ∣Pr(D&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;(1&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) = 1) − Pr(''D''&lt;sup&gt;''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;(1&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) = 1)∣ &lt; ''ε''(''s''), where ''K'' ← {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is chosen uniformly at random and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is chosen uniformly at random from the set of permutations on ''n''-bit strings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Jonathan|last2=Lindell|first2=Yehuda|title=Introduction to Modern Cryptography: Principles and Protocols|date=2007|publisher=Chapman and Hall/CRC|url=https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Cryptography-Principles-Protocols/dp/1584885513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pseudorandom permutation family''' is a collection of pseudorandom permutations, where a specific permutation may be chosen using a key.

===Unpredictable permutation===
An [[Adversary (cryptography)|adversary]] for an unpredictable permutation is defined to be an algorithm that is given access to an oracle for both forward and inverse permutation operations. The adversary is given a challenge input ''k'' and is asked to predict the value of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. It is allowed to make a series of queries to the oracle to help it make this prediction, but is not allowed to query the value of ''k'' itself.&lt;ref name="puniya07"&gt;{{citation|title=New Design Criteria for Hash Functions and Block Ciphers|first=Prashant|last=Puniya|year=2007|series=Ph.D. thesis|publisher=Department of Computer Science, New York University|url=https://ftp.cs.nyu.edu/web/Research/Theses/puniya_prashant.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A randomized algorithm for generating permutations generates an '''unpredictable permutation''' if its outputs are permutations on a set of items (described by length-''n'' binary strings)  that cannot be predicted with accuracy significantly better than random by an adversary that makes a polynomial (in ''n'') number of queries to the oracle prior to the challenge round, whose running time is [[polynomial time|polynomial]] in ''n'', and whose error probability is less than 1/2 for all instances. That is, it cannot be predicted in the [[complexity class]] [[PP (complexity)|PP]], [[Oracle machine|relativized]] by the oracle for the permutation.&lt;ref name="puniya07"/&gt;

==The model of block ciphers==

The idealized abstraction of a (keyed) [[block cipher]] is a truly [[random permutation]] on the mappings between plaintext and ciphertext.  If a distinguishing algorithm exists that achieves significant [[advantage (cryptography)|advantage]] with less effort than specified by the block cipher's [[security parameter]] (this usually means the effort required should be about the same as a brute force search through the cipher's key space), then the cipher is considered broken at least in a certificational sense, even if such a break doesn't immediately lead to a practical [[computer security|security]] failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Mihir Bellare]], [[Phillip Rogaway]] |date=2005-09-20 |title=Introduction to Modern Cryptography |url=http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/~mihir/cse207/classnotes.html |chapter=Chapter 3: Pseudorandom functions |accessdate=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern ciphers are expected to have super pseudorandomness.
That is, the cipher should be [[ciphertext indistinguishability#Indistinguishable from random noise|indistinguishable from a randomly chosen permutation]] on the same message space, even if the adversary has black-box access to the forward and inverse directions of the cipher.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Gentry and Zulfikar Ramzan. [https://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/archive/2004/ASIACRYPT/218/218.pdf "Eliminating Random Permutation Oracles in the Even-Mansour Cipher"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties of unpredictable permutations==
It can be shown that a function ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is not a secure [[message authentication code]] (MAC) if it satisfies only the unpredictability requirement. It can also be shown that one cannot build an efficient variable input length MAC from a block cipher which is modelled as an UP of ''n'' bits. It has been shown that the output of a ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''/''ω''(log&amp;nbsp;''λ'') round Feistel construction with unpredictable round functions may leak all the intermediate round values.&lt;ref name="puniya07"/&gt; Even for realistic Unpredictable Functions (UF), some partial information about the intermediate round values may be leaked through the output. It was later shown that if a super-logarithmic number of rounds in the Feistel construction is used, then the resulting UP construction is secure even if the adversary gets all the intermediate round values along with the permutation output.&lt;ref name="eurocrypt07"&gt;Advances in Cryptology – EUROCRYPT 2007: 26th Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques – by Moni Naor, International Association for Cryptologic Research&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a theorem that has been proven in this regard which states that if there exists an efficient UP adversary ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''π''&lt;/sub&gt; that has non-negligible advantage ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''π''&lt;/sub&gt; in the unpredictability game against UP construction ψ&lt;sub&gt;U,k&lt;/sub&gt; and which makes a polynomial number of queries to the challenger, then there also exists a UF adversary ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; that has non-negligible advantage in the unpredictability game against a UF sampled from the UF family&amp;nbsp;''F'' . From this, it can be shown that the maximum advantage of the UP adversary ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''π''&lt;/sub&gt; is ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''π''&lt;/sub&gt; = O (''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''f''.&lt;/sub&gt; (''qk'')&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;). Here ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the maximum advantage of a UF adversary running in time O(''t'' + (''qk'')&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) against a UF sampled from ''F'', where ''t'' is the running time of the PRP adversary ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''ψ''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q'' is the number of queries made by it.&lt;ref name="eurocrypt07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="puniya"&gt;http://cs.nyu.edu/~puniya/papers/public_feistel.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a signature scheme that satisfies the property of unpredictability and not necessarily pseudo-randomness is essentially a Verifiable Unpredictable Function (VUF). A verifiable unpredictable function is defined analogously to a Verifiable Pseudorandom Function (VRF) but for pseudo-randomness being substituted with weaker unpredictability. Verifiable unpredictable permutations are the permutation analogs of VUFs or unpredictable analogs of VRPs. A VRP is also a VUP and a VUP can actually be built by building a VRP via the Feistel construction applied to a VRF. But this is not viewed useful since VUFs appear to be much easier to construct than VRFs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Regularized canonical correlation analysis''' is a way of using [[ridge regression]] to solve the [[singularity theory|singularity]] problem in the [[cross-covariance matrix|cross-covariance matrices]] of [[canonical correlation analysis]]. By converting &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cov}(X, X)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cov}(Y, Y)&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cov}(X, X) + \lambda I_X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cov}(Y, Y) + \lambda I_Y&lt;/math&gt;, it ensures that the above matrices will have reliable [[Matrix inverse|inverses]].

The idea probably dates back to [[Hrishikesh D. Vinod]]'s publication in 1976 where he called it "Canonical ridge".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Richard Baldus''' (11 May 1885, [[Salonika]] – 28 January 1945, [[Munich]]) was a German mathematician, specializing in geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{NDB|1|558|558|Baldus, Richard|Georg Faber|116043083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Baldus was the son of a station chief of the [[Anatolian Railway]]. After his graduation (''Abitur'') in 1904 at [[Wilhelmsgymnasium München]],&lt;ref&gt;Jahresbericht vom K. Wilhelms-Gymnasium zu München. {{ZDB|12448436}}, 1903/04&lt;/ref&gt; he studied in Munich and at the [[University of Erlangen]], where he received his Ph.D. (''Promotierung'') in 1910 under [[Max Noether]] with thesis ''Über Strahlensysteme, welche unendlich viele Regelflächen 2. Grades enthalten''&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=51866}}&lt;/ref&gt; and where he received his ''Habilitierung'' in 1911. He became in 1919 ''Professor für Geometrie'' at the [[Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe]] and served there as rector in 1923–1924. In 1932 he became ''Professor für Geometrie'' (as successor to [[Sebastian Finsterwalder]]) at [[TU München]], where in 1934 he also became the successor to the professorial chair of [[Walther von Dyck]], upon the latter's retirement.

In 1933 Baldus was the president of the [[Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung]]. He was an [[invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 1928 at Bologna.

'''Risk appetite''' is a concept to help guide an organization's approach to [[risk]] and [[risk management]].

==Definition==
Risk appetite is the level of risk that an organization is prepared to accept in pursuit of its objectives, and before action is deemed necessary to reduce the risk. It represents a balance between the potential benefits of innovation and the threats that change inevitably brings. The [[ISO 31000]] risk management standard refers to risk appetite as the "Amount and type of risk that an organization is prepared to pursue, retain or take". In a literal sense, defining your appetite means defining how "hungry" you are for risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tattam|first1=David|title=Risk Appetite: How hungry are you for risk?|url=http://blog.protecht.com.au/risk-appetite|website=Protecht Risk Management Insights|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levels of risk appetite==
The appropriate level will depend on the nature of the work undertaken and the objectives pursued. For example, where public safety is critical (e.g. operating a nuclear power station) appetite will tend to be low, while for an innovative project (e.g. early development on an innovative computer program) it may be very high, with the acceptance of short term failure that could pave the way to longer term success.

Below are examples of broad approaches to setting risk appetite that a business may adopt to ensure a response to risk that is proportionate given their business objectives.&lt;ref&gt;''Thinking about Risk -'' [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130102192817/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/thinking_about_risk.htm ''Managing your risk appetite: A practitioner's guide''] November 2006 [[HM Treasury]], page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Averse'': Avoidance of risk and uncertainty is a key organization objective.
* ''Minimal'': Preference for ultra-safe options that are low risk and only have a potential for limited reward.
* ''Cautious'': Preference for safe options that have a low degree of risk and may only have limited potential for reward.
* ''Open'': Willing to consider all potential options and choose the one most likely to result in successful delivery, while also providing an acceptable level of reward and value for money.
* ''Hungry'': Eager to be innovative and to choose options offering potentially higher business rewards, despite greater inherent risk.

The appropriate approach may vary across an organization, with different parts of the business adopting an appetite that reflects their specific role, with an overarching risk appetite framework to ensure consistency.

==Measuring risk appetite== 
Precise measurement is not always possible and risk appetite will sometimes be defined by a broad statement of approach. An organization may have an appetite for some types of risk and be averse to others, depending on the context and the potential losses or gains.

However, often measures can be developed for different categories of risk. For example, it may aid a project to know what level of delay or financial loss it is permitted to bear. Where an organization has standard measures to define the impact and likelihood of risks, this can be used to define the maximum level of risk tolerable before action should be taken to lower it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Hassani |first1 = B.K. |title = Risk Appetite in Practice: Vulgaris Mathematica |journal = The IUP Journal of Financial Risk Management |volume = 12 |issue = 1 |year = 2015 |pages = 7–22 |ssrn = 2672757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose and benefits==
By defining its risk appetite, an organization can arrive at an appropriate balance between uncontrolled innovation and excessive caution. It can guide people on the level of risk permitted and encourage consistency of approach across an organisation.

Defined acceptable levels of risk also means that resources are not spent on further reducing risks that are already at an acceptable level.

==Main areas of risk appetite==
In literature{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} there are six main areas of risk appetite:

# financial
# health
# recreational
# ethical
# social
# information

There is often a confusion between ''risk management'' and ''risk appetite'', with the rigor of the former now recovering some of its lost ground from the vagueness of the latter. Derived correctly the risk appetite is a consequence of a rigorous risk management analysis not a precursor. Simple risk management techniques deal with the impact of hazardous events, but this ignores the possibility of collateral effects of a bad outcome, such as for example becoming technically bankrupt. The quantity that can be put at risk depends on the cover available should there be a loss, and a proper analysis takes this into account. The "appetite" follows logically from this analysis. For example an organization should be "hungry for risk" if it has more than ample cover compared with its competitors and should therefore be able to gain greater returns in the market from high risk ventures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5104">In [[physics]], the '''slowly varying envelope approximation'''&lt;ref&gt;Arecchi, F. T. &amp; Bonifacio, R. IEEE J. Quantum Electron.
1, 169–178 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; ('''SVEA''', sometimes also called '''slowly varying amplitude approximation''' or '''SVAA''') is the assumption that the [[envelope (waves)|envelope]] of a forward-travelling [[wave]] pulse varies slowly in time and space compared to a [[period (physics)|period]] or [[wavelength]]. This requires the [[spectrum]] of the signal to be [[narrow-band]]ed&amp;mdash;hence it also referred to as the '''narrow-band approximation'''.

The slowly varying envelope approximation is often used because the resulting equations are in many cases easier to solve than the original equations, reducing the order of—all or some of—the highest-order [[partial derivative]]s. But the validity of the assumptions which are made need to be justified.

==Example==

For example, consider the [[electromagnetic wave equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 E - \mu_0\, \varepsilon_0\, \frac{\partial^2E}{\partial t^2} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

If '''k'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[wave number]] and [[angular frequency]] of the (characteristic) [[carrier wave]] for the signal ''E''('''r''',''t''), the following representation is useful:

:&lt;math&gt;E(\mathbf{r},t) = \Re\left\{ E_0(\mathbf{r},t)\, e^{i\,( \mathbf{k}_0\, \cdot\, \mathbf{r} - \omega_0\, t )} \right\},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Re\{\cdot\}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[real part]] of the quantity between brackets.

In the ''slowly varying envelope approximation'' (SVEA) it is assumed that the [[complex amplitude]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''r''', ''t'') only varies slowly with '''r''' and ''t''. This inherently implies that ''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''r''', ''t'') represents waves propagating forward, predominantly in the '''k'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; direction. As a result of the slow variation of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''r''', ''t''), when taking derivatives, the highest-order derivatives may be neglected:&lt;ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \left| \nabla^2 E_0 \right| \ll \left| \vec k_0\cdot \nabla E_0 \right|&lt;/math&gt; {{pad|3em}} and {{pad|3em}} &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \left| \frac{\partial^2 E_0}{\partial t^2} \right| \ll \left| \omega_0\, \frac{\partial E_0}{\partial t} \right|,&lt;/math&gt; {{pad|3em}} with {{pad|3em}}&lt;math&gt;k_0 = |\mathbf{k}_0|.&lt;/math&gt;

===Full approximation===

Consequently, the wave equation is approximated in the SVEA as:

:&lt;math&gt;2\, i\, \mathbf{k}_0\, \cdot \nabla E_0 + 2\, i\, \omega_0\, \mu_0\, \varepsilon_0\, \frac{\partial E_0}{\partial t} - \left( k_0^2 - \omega_0^2\, \mu_0\, \varepsilon_0 \right)\, E_0 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

It is convenient to choose '''k'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that they satisfy the [[dispersion relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; k_0^2 - \omega_0^2\, \mu_0\, \varepsilon_0  = 0.\, &lt;/math&gt;

This gives the following approximation to the wave equation, as a result of the slowly varying envelope approximation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}_0 \cdot \nabla E_0 + \omega_0\, \mu_0\, \varepsilon_0\, \frac{\partial E_0}{\partial t} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a [[hyperbolic partial differential equation]], like the original wave equation, but now of first-order instead of second-order. It is valid for coherent forward-propagating waves in directions near the '''k'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-direction. The space and time scales over which ''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; varies are generally much longer than the spatial wavelength and temporal period of the carrier wave.  A numerical solution of the envelope equation thus can use much larger space and time steps, resulting in significantly less computational effort.

===Parabolic approximation===

Assume wave propagation is dominantly in the ''z''-direction, and '''k'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is taken in this direction. The SVEA is only applied to the second-order spatial derivatives in the ''z''-direction and time. If &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Delta_\perp=\partial^2/\partial x^2 + \partial^2/\partial y^2&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Laplace operator]] in the ''x''–''y'' plane, the result is:&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3213">The '''spectral centroid''' is a measure used in [[digital signal processing]] to characterise a [[spectrum]]. It indicates where the "center of mass" of the spectrum is located. Perceptually, it has a robust connection with the impression of "brightness" of a sound.&lt;ref name="greygordon78"&gt;Grey, J. M., Gordon, J. W., 1978. Perceptual effects of spectral modifications on musical timbres. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 63 (5), 1493–1500, {{doi|10.1121/1.381843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is calculated as the [[weighted mean]] of the frequencies present in the signal, determined using a [[Fourier transform]], with their magnitudes as the weights:&lt;ref&gt;[http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/analyse-synthese/peeters/ARTICLES/Peeters_2003_cuidadoaudiofeatures.pdf A Large Set of Audio Features for Sound Description] - technical report published by [[IRCAM]] in 2003. Section 6.1.1 describes the spectral centroid.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; 
\mathrm{Centroid} = \frac{
  \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}
    f(n)
    x(n)
} {
  \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}
    x(n)
}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x(n)'' represents the weighted frequency value, or magnitude, of [[Histogram|bin]] number ''n'', and ''f(n)'' represents the center frequency of that bin.

==Alternative usage==

Some people use "spectral centroid" to refer to the [[median]] of the spectrum. This is a ''different'' statistic, the difference being essentially the same as the difference between the unweighted median and [[mean]] statistics. Since both are [[Average|measures of central tendency]], in some situations they will exhibit some similarity of behaviour. But since typical audio spectra are not [[normal distribution|normally distributed]], the two measures will often give strongly different values. Grey and Gordon in 1978 found the mean a better fit than the median.&lt;ref name="greygordon78"/&gt;

==Applications==

Because the spectral centroid is a good predictor of the "brightness" of a sound,&lt;ref name="greygordon78"/&gt; it is widely used in digital audio and music processing as an automatic measure of musical [[timbre]].&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10385">{{For|triangular numbers that are themselves square|square triangular number}}

[[File:Nicomachus_theorem_3D.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|A square whose side length is a triangular number can be partitioned into squares and half-squares whose areas add to cubes. From {{harvtxt|Gulley|2010}}.]]

In [[number theory]], the sum of the first {{mvar|n}} [[Cube (algebra)|cube]]s is the [[Square number|square]] of the {{mvar|n}}th [[triangular number]]. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;1^3+2^3+3^3+\cdots+n^3 = \left(1+2+3+\cdots+n\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;
The same equation may be written more compactly using the mathematical notation for [[summation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n k^3 = \bigg(\sum_{k=1}^n k\bigg)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

This [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] is sometimes called '''Nicomachus's theorem''', after [[Nicomachus|Nicomachus of Gerasa]] (c. 60 – c. 120 CE).

==History==
Many early mathematicians have studied and provided proofs of Nicomachus's theorem. {{harvtxt|Stroeker|1995}} claims that "every student of number theory surely must have marveled at this miraculous fact". {{harvtxt|Pengelley|2002}} finds references to the identity not only in the works of [[Nicomachus]] in what is now [[Jordan]] in the first century CE, but also in those of [[Aryabhata]] in [[India]] in the fifth century, and in those of [[Al-Karaji]] circa 1000 in [[Persia]]. {{harvtxt|Bressoud|2004}} mentions several additional early mathematical works on this formula, by [[Alchabitius]] (tenth century Arabia), [[Gersonides]] (circa 1300 France), and [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] (circa 1500 India); he reproduces Nilakantha's visual proof.

==Numeric values;  geometric and probabilistic interpretation==
The sequence of squared triangular numbers is
:{{math|[[0 (number)|0]], [[1 (number)|1]], [[9 (number)|9]], [[36 (number)|36]], [[100 (number)|100]], 225,}} {{math|441, 784, 1296, 2025, 3025, 4356, 6084, 8281,}} ... {{OEIS|id=A000537}}.

These numbers can be viewed as [[figurate number]]s, a four-dimensional hyperpyramidal generalization of the [[triangular number]]s and [[square pyramidal number]]s.

As {{harvtxt|Stein|1971}} observes, these numbers also count the number of rectangles with horizontal and vertical sides formed in an {{math|''n'' &amp;times; ''n''}} [[Square lattice|grid]]. For instance, the points of a {{math|4 &amp;times; 4}} grid (or a square made up of three smaller squares on a side) can form 36 different rectangles. The number of squares in a square grid is similarly counted by the square pyramidal numbers.

The identity also admits a natural probabilistic interpretation as follows. Let {{math|''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'', ''W''}} be four integer numbers independently and uniformly chosen at random between {{math|1}} and {{mvar|n}}. Then, the probability that {{mvar|W}} be the largest of the four numbers is equal to the probability that both {{mvar|Y}} is at least as large as {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|W}} is at least as large as {{mvar|Z}}, that is, {{math|1='''P'''({max(''X'',''Y'',''Z'') ≤ ''W''}) = '''P'''({''X'' ≤ ''Y''} ∩ {''Z'' ≤ ''W''})}}. Indeed, these probabilities are respectively the left and right sides of the Nichomacus identity, normalized to make probabilities by dividing both sides by&amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

==Proofs==
{{harvs|txt|first=Charles|last=Wheatstone|authorlink=Charles Wheatstone|year=1854}} gives a particularly simple derivation, by expanding each cube in the sum into a set of consecutive odd numbers. Indeed, he begins by giving the identity 

:&lt;math&gt;n^3 = \underbrace{\left(n^2-n+1\right) + \left(n^2-n+1+2\right) + \left(n^2-n+1+4\right)+ \cdots + \left(n^2+n-1\right)}_{n \text{ consecutive odd numbers}}.&lt;/math&gt;

That identity is related to [[triangular numbers]] &lt;math&gt;T_n&lt;/math&gt; in the following way:

:&lt;math&gt;n^3 =\sum _{k=T_{n-1}+1}^{T_{n}} (2 k-1),&lt;/math&gt;

and thus the summands forming &lt;math&gt;n^3&lt;/math&gt; start off just after those forming all previous values &lt;math&gt;1^3&lt;/math&gt; up to &lt;math&gt;(n-1)^3&lt;/math&gt;.
Applying this property, along with another well-known identity:

:&lt;math&gt;n^2 = \sum_{k=1}^n (2k-1),&lt;/math&gt;

we obtain the following derivation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum_{k=1}^n k^3 &amp;= 1 + 8 + 27 + 64 + \cdots + n^3 \\
&amp;= \underbrace{1}_{1^3} + \underbrace{3+5}_{2^3} + \underbrace{7 + 9 + 11}_{3^3} + \underbrace{13 + 15 + 17 + 19}_{4^3} + \cdots + \underbrace{\left(n^2-n+1\right) + \cdots + \left(n^2+n-1\right)}_{n^3} \\
&amp;= \underbrace{\underbrace{\underbrace{\underbrace{1}_{1^2} + 3}_{2^2} + 5}_{3^2} + \cdots + \left(n^2 + n - 1\right)}_{\left( \frac{n^{2}+n}{2} \right)^{2}} \\
&amp;= (1 + 2 + \cdots + n)^2 \\
&amp;= \bigg(\sum_{k=1}^n k\bigg)^2.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Sum of cubes2.png|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Visual demonstration that the square of a triangular number equals a sum of cubes.]]
In the more recent mathematical literature, {{harvtxt|Stein|1971}} uses the rectangle-counting interpretation of these numbers to form a geometric proof of the identity (see also {{harvnb|Benjamin|Quinn|Wurtz|2006}}); he observes that it may also be proved easily (but uninformatively) by induction, and states that {{harvtxt|Toeplitz|1963}} provides "an interesting old Arabic proof". {{harvtxt|Kanim|2004}} provides a purely visual proof, {{harvtxt|Benjamin|Orrison|2002}} provide two additional proofs, and {{harvtxt|Nelsen|1993}} gives seven geometric proofs.

==Generalizations==
A similar result to Nicomachus's theorem holds for all [[Faulhaber's formula|power sums]], namely that odd power sums (sums of odd powers) are a polynomial in triangular numbers.
These are called [[Faulhaber's formula#Faulhaber polynomials|Faulhaber polynomials]], of which the sum of cubes is the simplest and most elegant example.

{{harvtxt|Stroeker|1995}} studies more general conditions under which the sum of a consecutive sequence of cubes forms a square. {{harvtxt|Garrett|Hummel|2004}} and {{harvtxt|Warnaar|2004}} study polynomial analogues of the square triangular number formula, in which series of polynomials add to the square of another polynomial.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4503">In [[field theory (physics)|field theory]], the '''Stueckelberg action''' (named after [[Ernst Stueckelberg]] (1938), "Die Wechselwirkungskräfte in der Elektrodynamik und in der Feldtheorie der Kräfte", ''Helv. Phys. Acta.'' '''11:'''   225) describes a massive spin-1 field as an '''R''' (the [[real number]]s are the [[Lie algebra]] of [[U(1)]]) [[Yang–Mills theory]] coupled to a real [[scalar field]] φ. This scalar field  takes on values in a real 1D [[affine representation]] of '''R''' with'' m'' as the [[coupling constant|coupling strength]].

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}=-\frac{1}{4}(\partial^\mu A^\nu-\partial^\nu A^\mu)(\partial_\mu A_\nu-\partial_\nu A_\mu)+\frac{1}{2}(\partial^\mu \varphi+m A^\mu)(\partial_\mu \varphi+m A_\mu) &lt;/math&gt;

This is a special case of the [[Higgs_mechanism#Abelian_Higgs_mechanism|Higgs mechanism]], where, in effect, {{mvar|λ}} and thus the mass of the Higgs scalar excitation has been taken to infinity, so the Higgs has decoupled and can be ignored, resulting in a nonlinear,  affine representation of the field, instead of a [[linear representation]] — in contemporary terminology, a ''U(1)'' nonlinear {{mvar|σ}}-model.

Gauge-fixing φ=0, yields the [[Proca action]].

This explains why, unlike the case for non-abelian vector fields, [[quantum electrodynamics]] with a massive photon '''''is''''', in fact,  [[renormalizable]], even though it is not manifestly [[gauge invariant]] (after the Stückelberg scalar has been eliminated in the Proca action).

==The Stueckelberg Extension of the Standard Model==
The Stueckelberg Lagrangian of the ''StSM'' (Stueckelberg extension of the Standard Model) consists of a [[gauge invariant]] kinetic term for a massive [[U(1)]] gauge field. Such a term can be implemented into the Lagrangian of the [[Standard Model]]
without destroying the renormalizability of the theory and further provides a mechanism for
mass generation that is distinct from the [[Higgs mechanism|Higgs]] mechanism in the context of [[Abelian group|Abelian]] gauge theories.

The model involves a non-trivial
mixing of the Stueckelberg and the Standard Model sectors by including an additional term in the effective Lagrangian of the Standard Model given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{St}=-\frac{1}{4}C_{\mu  \nu  }C^{\mu\nu }+g_XC_{\mu }\mathcal{J}_X^{\mu }-\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial _{\mu }\sigma +M_1C_{\mu}+M_2B_{\mu }\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The first term above is the Stueckelberg field strength, &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; are topological mass parameters and &lt;math&gt;\sigma &lt;/math&gt; is the axion.
After symmetry breaking in the electroweak sector the photon remains massless. The model predicts a new type of gauge boson dubbed &lt;math&gt;Z'_{St}&lt;/math&gt; which inherits a very distinct narrow [[decay width]] in this model. The St sector of the StSM decouples from the SM in limit &lt;math&gt;M_2/M_1 \to 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Stueckelberg type couplings arise quite naturally in theories involving [[compactification (physics)|compactification]]s of higher-dimensional [[string theory]], in particular, these couplings appear in the dimensional reduction of the ten-dimensional N = 1 [[supergravity]] coupled to [[supersymmetric]] Yang–Mills gauge fields in the presence of internal gauge fluxes. In the context of intersecting [[D-brane]] model building, products of U(N) gauge groups are broken to their [[SU(N)]] subgroups via the Stueckelberg couplings and thus the Abelian gauge fields become massive. Further, in a much simpler fashion one may consider a model with only one extra dimension (a type of [[Kaluza–Klein model]]) and compactify down to a four-dimensional theory. The resulting Lagrangian will contain massive vector gauge bosons that acquire masses through the Stueckelberg mechanism.

'''Sudhakara Dvivedi''' (1855–1910) was an [[India]]n scholar in [[Sanskrit]] and [[mathematics]].

==Biography==
Sudhakara Dvivedi was born in 1855 in Khajuri, a village near [[Varanasi]]. In childhood he studied mathematics under Pandit Devakrsna.

In 1883 he was appointed a librarian in the [[Government Sanskrit College, Varanasi]] where in 1890 he was appointed the teacher of [[mathematics]] and [[astrology]] after [[Bapudeva Sastri]] retired in 1889.&lt;ref name="DaubenScriba2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joseph W.

He was the head of mathematics department in Queen's college Benaras from where he retired in 1905 and mathematician [[Ganesh Prasad]] became the new head of department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prasad|first=Ganesh|title=Some great mathematicians of the nineteenth century|publisher=Krishna Prakashan Media|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dvivedi wrote a number of translations, commentaries and treatises, including one on [[algebra]] which included topics such as [[Pellian equation]]s, squares, and [[Diophantine equation]]s.&lt;ref name="Bhāskarācārya2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Patwardhan|first1=K.S.|last2=Naimpally|first2=A.S.|last3=Singh|first3=Shyamlal|title=Līlāvatī of Bhāskarācārya: a treatise of mathematics of Vedic tradition : with rationale in terms of modern mathematics largely based on N.H.

[[Image:Chlorine-trifluoride-3D-vdW.png|thumb|left|200px|Structure of [[chlorine trifluoride]], an example of a compound with T-shaped coordination geometry.]]
In chemistry, '''T-shaped molecular geometry''' describes the structures of some molecules where a central atom has three [[ligand]]s. Ordinarily, three-coordinated compounds adopt [[Trigonal planar molecular geometry|trigonal planar]] or [[Trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry|pyramidal]] geometries. Examples of T-shaped molecules are the halogen trifluorides, such as [[ClF3|ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greenwood |first1=N. N. |last2=Earnshaw |first2=A. |date=1997 |title=Chemistry of the Elements |edition=2nd |location=Oxford |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |ISBN=0-7506-3365-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[VSEPR theory]], T-shaped geometry results when three ligands and two lone pairs of electrons are bonded to the central atom, written in [[VSEPR theory#AXE notation|AXE notation]] as AX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The T-shaped geometry is related to the [[trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry]] for AX&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; molecules with three equatorial and two axial ligands. In an AX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, the two lone pairs occupy two equatorial positions, and the three ligand atoms occupy the two axial positions as well as one equatorial position. The three atoms bond at 90° angles on one side of the central atom, producing the T shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft2nd|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trifluoroxenate(II) anion, {{chem|XeF|3|−}}, has been investigated as a possible first example of an AX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, which might be expected by VSEPR reasoning to have six electron pairs in an [[octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]] arrangement with both the three lone pairs and the three ligands in a [[Coordination complex#Cis–trans isomerism and facial–meridional isomerism|''mer'']] or T-shaped orientations.&lt;ref name=Vasdev&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Neil |last1=Vasdev |first2=Matthew D. |last2=Moran |first3=Heikki M. |last3=Tuononen |first4=Raman |last4=Chirakal |first5=Reijo J. |last5=Suontamo |first6=Alex D. |last6=Bain |first7=Gary J. |last7=Schrobilgen |title=NMR Spectroscopic Evidence for the Intermediacy of {{chem|XeF|3|−}} in XeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Exchange, Attempted Syntheses and Thermochemistry of {{chem|XeF|3|−}} Salts, and Theoretical Studies of the {{chem|XeF|3|−}} Anion |journal=[[Inorganic Chemistry (journal)|Inorg.

A [[computational chemistry]] study showed a distorted planar Y-shaped geometry with the smallest F–Xe–F bond angle equal to 69°, rather than 90° as in a T-shaped geometry.&lt;ref name=Vasdev/&gt;

'''Tortuosity''' is a property of [[curve]] being [[wiktionary:tortuous|tortuous]] (twisted; having many turns). There have been several attempts to quantify this property. Tortuosity is commonly used to describe [[diffusion]] and [[fluid flow]] in [[porous media]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Epstein | first1 = N | year = 1989 | title = On tortuosity and the tortuosity factor in flow and diffusion through porous media, Chem.

U. | last2 = Schneebeli | first2 = M. | last3 = Sokratov | first3 = S. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tortuosity in 2-D==

Subjective estimation (sometimes aided by optometric grading scales)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.optometry.co.uk/uploads/articles/e022e939c23ddd43951691b84a1efa90_pearson20031017.pdf Richard M. Pearson. Optometric Grading Scales for use in everyday practice.

The simplest mathematical method to estimate tortuosity is the arc-chord ratio: the ratio of the [[Arc length|length]] of the curve (''L'') to the distance between the ends of it (''C''):

:&lt;math&gt;\tau  = \frac{L}{C}&lt;/math&gt;

Arc-chord ratio equals 1 for a straight line and is infinite for a circle.

Another method, proposed in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = William E. | last2 = Goldbaum | first2 = Michael | last3 = Cote | first3 = Brad | last4 = Kube | first4 = Paul | last5 = Nelson | first5 = Mark R. | year = 1999 | title = Automated measurement of retinal vascular tortuosity | url = http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~wehart/Papers/1997/HarGolCotKubNel97-amia.ps.gz | journal = International Journal of Medical Informatics | volume = 53 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 239–252 | doi = 10.1016/s1386-5056(98)00163-4 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090109094137/http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~wehart/Papers/1997/HarGolCotKubNel97-amia.ps.gz | archivedate = 2009-01-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; is to estimate the tortuosity as the [[integral]] of the square (or module) of the [[curvature]]. Dividing the result by length of curve or chord has also been tried.

In 2002 several Italian scientists&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?isnumber=28608&amp;arnumber=1279902&amp;count=267&amp;index=227 Enrico Grisan, Marco Foracchia, Alfredo Ruggeri. A novel method for automatic evaluation of retinal vessel tortuosity. Proceedings of the 25th Annual International Conference of the IEEE EMBS, Cancun, Mexico, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; proposed one more method. At first, the curve is divided into several (''N'') parts with constant sign of curvature (using [[hysteresis]] to decrease sensitivity to noise). Then the arc-chord ratio for each part is found and the tortuosity is estimated by:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau  = \frac{{N - 1}}{L} \cdot \sum\limits_{i = 1}^N {\left( {\frac{{L_i }}{{S_i }} - 1} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case tortuosity of both straight line and circle is estimated to be 0.

In 1993&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/Research-Reports/71.ps.gz M. Mächler, Very smooth nonparametric curve estimation by penalizing change of curvature, Technical Report 71, ETH Zurich, May 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; Swiss mathematician Martin Mächler proposed an analogy: it’s relatively easy to drive a bicycle or a car in a trajectory with a constant curvature (an arc of a circle), but it’s much harder to drive where curvature changes. This would imply that roughness (or tortuosity) could be measured by relative change of curvature. In this case the proposed "local" measure was [[derivative]] of [[logarithm]] of curvature:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{{dx}}\log \left( \kappa \right) = \frac{{\kappa'}}{\kappa}&lt;/math&gt;

However, in this case tortuosity of a straight line is left undefined.

In 2005 it was proposed to measure tortuosity by an integral of square of derivative of curvature, divided by the length of a curve:&lt;ref&gt;Patasius, M.; Marozas, V.; Lukosevicius, A.; Jegelevicius, D.. Evaluation of tortuosity of eye blood vessels using the integral of square of derivative of curvature // EMBEC'05: proceedings of the 3rd IFMBE European Medical and Biological Engineering Conference, November 20–25, 2005, Prague. - {{ISSN|1727-1983}}. - Prague. - 2005, Vol. 11, p. [1-4]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tau  = \frac{{\int\limits_{t_1 }^{t_2 } {\left( {\kappa'\left( t \right)} \right)^2 } dt}}{L}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case tortuosity of both straight line and circle is estimated to be 0.

[[Fractal dimension]] has been used to quantify tortuosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Caldwell | first1 = I. R. | last2 = Nams | first2 = V. O. | year = 2006 | title = A compass without a map: tortuosity and orientation of eastern painted turtles (''Chrysemys picta picta'') released in unfamiliar territory | url = http://biology.unm.edu/toolson/Backups/Science/TSC%20Projects/_DARPA%20Track-level%20Discrimination%20Project/Nams'%20Papers/Tortuosity%20and%20orientation%20of%20painted%20turtles%20released%20in%20unfamiliar%20territory.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 84 | issue = 8| pages = 1129–1137 | doi=10.1139/z06-102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fractal dimension in 2D for a straight line is 1 (the minimal value), and ranges up to 2 for a [[plane-filling curve]] or [[Brownian motion]].&lt;ref name="Benhamou 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benhamou | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = How to reliably estimate the tortuosity of an animal's path: straightness, sinuosity, or fractal dimension?. | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 229 | issue = 2| pages = 209–220 | doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.03.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most of these methods [[digital filters]] and [[approximation]] by [[Spline (mathematics)|splines]] can be used to decrease sensitivity to noise.

Comparing this distance to the straight-line distance shows that the tortuosity is about 1.5 for this sample. It has been demonstrated that the tortuosity increases when the porosity decreases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Espinoza-Andaluz|first=Mayken|last2=Andersson|first2=Martin|last3=Sundén|first3=Bengt|title=Computational time and domain size analysis of porous media flows using the lattice Boltzmann method|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898122116306721|journal=Computers &amp; Mathematics with Applications|doi=10.1016/j.camwa.2016.12.001|volume=74|year=2017|pages=26–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Usually subjective estimation is used. However, several ways to adapt methods estimating tortuosity in 2-D have also been tried. The methods include arc-chord ratio, arc-chord ratio divided by number of [[inflection point]]s and integral of square of curvature, divided by length of the curve (curvature is estimated assuming that small segments of curve are planar).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1225850 E. Bullitt, G. Gerig, S. M. Pizer, Weili Lin, S. R. Aylward. Measuring tortuosity of the intracerebral vasculature from MRA images. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, Volume 22, Issue 9, Sept. 2003, p. 1163 - 1171]&lt;/ref&gt; Another method used for quantifying tortuosity in 3D has been applied in 3D reconstructions of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes where the Euclidean distance sums of the centroids of a pore were divided by the length of the pore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scitation.aip.org/journals/doc/ESLEF6-ft/vol_10/iss_12/B214_1.html Gostovic, D., et al., Three-dimensional reconstruction of porous LSCF cathodes.

==Applications of tortuosity==

Tortuosity of [[blood vessels]] (for example, [[retina]]l and [[Brain|cerebral]] blood vessels) is known to be used as a [[medical sign]].

In mathematics, [[cubic spline]]s minimize the [[functional (mathematics)|functional]], equivalent to integral of square of curvature (approximating the curvature as the second derivative).

In many engineering domains dealing with mass transfer in porous materials, such as [[hydrogeology]] or [[heterogeneous catalysis]], the tortuosity refers to the ratio of the diffusivity in the free space to the diffusivity in the [[porous medium]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watanabe | first1 = Y. | last2 = Nakashima | first2 = Y. | year = 2001 | title = Two-dimensional random walk program for the calculation of the tortuosity of porous media | url = http://staff.aist.go.jp/nakashima.yoshito/programs/rw2d.txt | journal = Journal of Groundwater Hydrology | volume = 43 | issue =  | pages = 13–22 | doi = 10.5917/jagh1987.43.13 | bibcode = 2001JGHyd..43...13W | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080703182953/http://staff.aist.go.jp/nakashima.yoshito/programs/rw2d.txt | archivedate = 2008-07-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (analogous to arc-chord ratio of path). Strictly speaking, however, the effective diffusivity is proportional to the reciprocal of the square of the geometrical tortuosity&lt;ref&gt;[http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/handle/2268/19609 Gommes, C.J., Bons, A.-J., Blacher, S. Dunsmuir, J. and Tsou, A. (2009) Practical methods for measuring the tortuosity of porous materials from binary or gray-tone tomographic reconstructions. American Institute of Chemical Engineering Journal, 55, 2000-2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the porous materials found in several layers of the [[Fuel cell|Fuel Cells]], the tortuosity is an important variable to be analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/4812669 Espinoza Andaluz, M., Sundén, B., Andersson, M., &amp; Yuan, J. (2014). Analysis of Porosity and Tortuosity in a 2D Selected Region of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode Using the Lattice Boltzmann Method. In Fuel Cell Seminar &amp; Energy Exposition]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to notice that there are different kind of tortuosity, i.e., gas-phase, ionic and electronic tortuosity.

In [[acoustics]] and following initial works by [[Maurice Anthony Biot]] in 1956, the tortuosity is used to describe [[sound propagation]] in fluid-saturated porous media. In such media, when frequency of the sound wave is high enough, the effect of viscous drag force between the solid and the fluid can be ignored. In this case, velocity of sound propagation in the fluid in the pores is non-dispersive and compared with the value of the velocity of sound in the free fluid is reduced by a ratio equal to the square root of the tortuosity. This has been used for a number of applications including the study of materials for acoustic isolation, and for oil prospection using acoustics means.

In [[analytical chemistry]] applied to [[polymer]]s and sometimes small molecules tortuosity is applied in [[Gel permeation chromatography]] (GPC) also known as Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC). As with any [[chromatography]] it is used to separate [[mixture]]s. In the case of GPC the separation is based on [[molecular size]] and it works by the use of stationary media with appropriately dimensioned pores. The separation occurs because larger molecules take a shorter, less tortuous path and elute more quickly and smaller molecules can pass into the pores and take a longer, more tortuous path and elute later.

In [[pharmaceutical sciences]], tortuosity is used in relation to diffusion-controlled release from solid dosage forms. Insoluble matrix formers, such as [[ethyl cellulose]], certain vinyl polymers, starch acetate and others control the permeation of the drug from the preparation and into the surrounding liquid. The rate of mass transfer per area unit is, among other factors, related to the shape of polymeric chains within the dosage form. Higher tortuosity or curviness retards mass transfer as it acts obstructively on the drug particles within the formulation.

[[HVAC]] makes extensive use of tortuosity in [[evaporator]] and [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] coils for [[heat exchangers]], whereas [[Ultra-high vacuum]] makes use of the inverse of tortuosity, which is conductivity, with short, straight, voluminous paths.

Tortuosity has been used in [[ecology]] to describe the movement paths of animals.&lt;ref name="Benhamou 2004"/&gt;

A '''uniquely inversible [[grammar]]''' is a [[formal grammar]] where no two distinct productions give the same [[result]].  This implies the specific production can be inferred from its results.

== Formal definition ==

&lt;math&gt;A \to \alpha \and B \to \beta \iff (A &lt;&gt; B \Rightarrow \alpha &lt;&gt; \beta)&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
;Uniquely inversibles

&lt;math&gt;A \to aA | bB &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;B \to b | a&lt;/math&gt;

;Not uniquely inversibles {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[graph theory]], a  '''vertex-transitive graph''' is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] ''G'' such that, given any two vertices v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of ''G'', there is some [[Graph automorphism|automorphism]]

:&lt;math&gt;f\colon V(G) \rightarrow V(G)\ &lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;f(v_1) = v_2.\ &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, a graph is vertex-transitive if its automorphism group [[Group action|acts transitively]] upon its vertices.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Chris|last1=Godsil|authorlink1=Chris Godsil|first2=Gordon|last2=Royle|authorlink2=Gordon Royle|title=Algebraic Graph Theory|series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]]|volume=207|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|year=2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A graph is vertex-transitive [[if and only if]] its [[graph complement]] is, since the group actions are identical.

Every [[symmetric graph]] without isolated vertices is vertex-transitive, and every vertex-transitive graph is [[Regular graph|regular]]. However, not all vertex-transitive graphs are symmetric (for example, the edges of the [[truncated tetrahedron]]), and not all regular graphs are vertex-transitive (for example, the [[Frucht graph]] and [[Tietze's graph]]).

== Finite examples ==
[[File:Tuncated tetrahedral graph.png|thumb|right|220px|The edges of the [[truncated tetrahedron]] form a vertex-transitive graph (also a [[Cayley graph]]) which is not [[symmetric graph|symmetric]].]]
Finite vertex-transitive graphs include the [[symmetric graph]]s (such as the [[Petersen graph]], the [[Heawood graph]] and the vertices and edges of the [[Platonic solid]]s).  The finite [[Cayley graph]]s (such as [[cube-connected cycles]]) are also vertex-transitive, as are the vertices and edges of the [[Archimedean solid]]s (though only two of these are symmetric). Potočnik, Spiga and Verret have constructed a census of all connected cubic vertex-transitive graphs on at most 1280 vertices.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Cubic vertex-transitive graphs on up to 1280 vertices|author1=Potočnik P., Spiga P.  |author2=Verret G. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Journal of Symbolic Computation |volume = 50 | year = 2013|pages = 465–477|doi=10.1016/j.jsc.2012.09.002|arxiv=1201.5317}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although every Cayley graph is vertex-transitive, there exist other vertex-transitive graphs that are not Cayley graphs. The most famous example is the Petersen graph, but others can be constructed including the [[line graph]]s of [[edge-transitive graph|edge-transitive]] non-[[bipartite graph|bipartite]] graphs with odd vertex degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Properties ==
The [[Connectivity (graph theory)|edge-connectivity]] of a vertex-transitive graph is equal to the [[regular graph|degree]] ''d'', while the [[Connectivity (graph theory)|vertex-connectivity]] will be at least 2(''d''+1)/3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Algebraic Graph Theory|author1=Godsil, C.  |author2=Royle, G. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001|publisher=Springer Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If the degree is 4 or less, or the graph is also [[edge-transitive graph|edge-transitive]], or the graph is a minimal [[Cayley graph]], then the vertex-connectivity will also be equal to ''d''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Technical Report TR-94-10|author=Babai, L.|year=1996|publisher=University of Chicago}}[http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/files/tr_authentic/TR-94-10.ps] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611212234/http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/files/tr_authentic/TR-94-10.ps |date=2010-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infinite examples ==
Infinite vertex-transitive graphs include:
* infinite [[Path (graph theory)|paths]] (infinite in both directions)
* infinite [[Regular graph|regular]] [[tree (graph theory)|trees]], e.g. the [[Cayley graph]] of the [[free group]]
* graphs of [[Uniform tiling|uniform tessellations]] (see a [[List of uniform planar tilings|complete list]] of planar [[tessellation]]s), including all [[Tiling by regular polygons|tilings by regular polygons]]
* infinite [[Cayley graph]]s
* the [[Rado graph]]

Two [[countable]] vertex-transitive graphs are called [[Glossary of Riemannian and metric geometry#Q|quasi-isometric]] if the ratio of their [[distance function]]s is bounded from below and from above.  A well known conjecture stated that every infinite vertex-transitive graph is quasi-isometric to a [[Cayley graph]].  A counterexample was proposed by [[:de:Reinhard Diestel|Diestel]] and [[Imre Leader|Leader]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Reinhard|last1=Diestel|first2=Imre|last2=Leader|authorlink2=Imre Leader|url=http://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/diestel/papers/Cayley.pdf|title=A conjecture concerning a limit of non-Cayley graphs|journal=Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics|volume=14|issue=1|year=2001|pages=17–25|doi=10.1023/A:1011257718029}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, Eskin, Fisher, and Whyte confirmed the counterexample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|first1=Alex|last1=Eskin|first2=David|last2=Fisher|first3=Kevin|last3=Whyte|eprint=math.GR/0511647 |title=Quasi-isometries and rigidity of solvable groups|year=2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Winifred''' "'''Fred'''" '''Burkle''' is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]] created by [[Joss Whedon]] and introduced by [[Shawn Ryan]] and [[Mere Smith]] on the [[television series]] ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''.  The character is portrayed by [[Amy Acker]].

==Biography==

===Character history===
Fred was born in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]] to Roger and Patricia "Trish" Burkle.  When she finished college, she moved to [[Los Angeles]] for graduate school at [[UCLA]].  Originally majoring in history, Fred took a [[physics]] class with Professor Seidel, which inspired her to take another path.  Around this time, she began working at Stewart Brunell Public Library.  In 1996, while shelving a demon language book, a curious Fred recited the [[wikt:cryptic|cryptic]] text out loud and was accidentally sucked into a dimensional portal to [[Pylea]] (her future friend [[Lorne (Angel)|Lorne]] was sucked into the same portal on his side and ended up in Los Angeles).  It was later discovered that the portal was actually opened by Fred's jealous college professor, Professor Seidel, who had sent every promising student to it, essentially sending them to their death.  Fred was the only one of at least six to return (cf. "[[Supersymmetry (Angel episode)|Supersymmetry]]").  In high school or college, Fred was a [[marijuana]] user as shown in the episode "[[Spin the Bottle (Angel)|Spin the Bottle]]".  In that episode, she asks Wesley and "Liam" for weed and was also revealed to have had to take a [[personality disorder]] test and to be something of a [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorist]].

===Angel Investigations===
For five years, Fred spent an arduous life as a "cow", the [[Pylea]]n word for humans who are kept as [[slaves]], and then as a fugitive.  The harsh life of solitude and [[serf]]dom took a serious toll on her [[social skills]], as well as her [[mental health]]; when Angel meets Fred, she is curled up in a cave, scribbling on the already-covered walls, having seemingly convinced herself that her previous life in L.A. had not been real.

It was revealed that Fred had once been forced to wear an explosive shock collar.  However, Fred's salvation comes when [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] and his crew arrive in Pylea to find [[Cordelia Chase]], who had become trapped there.  It is notable that when Angel's demon came fully to the fore, it attacked just about everyone ''but'' Fred – including Gunn and Wesley.  Despite this shocking display of violence, Angel never seemed to scare Fred, and even at his most demonic, he never attacked her.  In fact, her presence seemed to have a calming effect on him.

When Pylea is liberated, Fred accompanies Angel and the rest of the gang back to Los Angeles and stays in the [[Hyperion Hotel]] to re-adjust to life on Earth and regain her mental stability.  Despite several traumatic instances, such as being held hostage by [[Charles Gunn (Angel)|Gunn]]'s old [[vampire]]-hunting crew, she adjusts quite well to "normal" life.

Her knowledge of physics and mathematics make her an excellent asset when researching and developing strategies.  Fred quickly develops a romantic relationship with Gunn, which lasts roughly one year.  She is also the object of affection of [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce]], who attempts to step aside after Gunn and Fred started dating, but is still drawn to her.  Near the end of her relationship with Gunn, Fred and Wesley share a kiss, but after discovering that Wesley had been in a relationship – albeit a rather complex one – with [[Lilah Morgan]], her feelings for Wesley cool considerably.

Eventually, Fred discovers that it was actually her former professor's fault that she had been trapped in Pylea, and indeed, Professor Seidel had attempted to trap her in another world yet again.  Furious, she plots to kill him with Wesley's help.  Gunn, however, feels that such a brutal act, even against Seidel, will ultimately destroy her.  As a result, in a battle where she is trying to trap him in a hell dimension, Gunn snaps Seidel's neck himself and drops the body into the portal.  Unfortunately, this causes a rift between Fred and Gunn, and ultimately ends their relationship.

===Wolfram &amp; Hart===
However, everything changes for Fred when she and the rest of Angel's crew join [[Wolfram &amp; Hart]]. (While Angel accepts a suite of rooms at Wolfram &amp; Hart as his new home, Fred, and maybe others of the inner circle, find a home in the Los Angeles area: hers is at 511 Windward Circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.buffyworld.com/angel/transcripts/102_tran.html |author= Edlund, Ben |authorlink= Ben Edlund |date= February 18, 2004 |title= Angel Transcript: "Smile Time", 5x14— Episode #102 |publisher= BuffyWorld |accessdate= September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to be forgotten with the advent of Illyria.)  Her memory is altered by a spell cast in Season Four's last episode, "[[Home (Angel)|Home]]", and it is unclear how much of the events of Seasons Three and Four she remembers differently or at all (everything specific to Angel's son [[Connor (Angel)|Connor]] is definitely lost).  Fred receives her own laboratory and becomes the head of [[Wolfram &amp; Hart]]'s Science Division.  She is a major asset to the team; Angel consistently relies on her department to quickly and efficiently solve problems.  After going on a few dates with co-worker [[List of minor Angel characters#Knox|Knox]], Fred begins to have feelings for Wesley again.  The pair are together for about a week, but the couple's happiness is not to last.

A mysterious [[sarcophagus]], allowed through customs by a signature from Gunn, appears in the lab.  As Fred examines it, a hole opens in the cover and a breath of wind blows into her face.  It turns out that the sarcophagus is a holding cell for one of the original, pure-breed demons known as the [[Old Ones (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Old Ones]], which is predestined to rise again.  The air Fred inhales is actually [[Illyria (Angel)|Illyria's]] essence, which immediately begins a parasitic existence in her body, eating away at it and making her a shell.  Worse still, Knox had worshipped Illyria for years and worked at Wolfram &amp; Hart for the sole purpose of bringing the demon back.  Because of his affections for Fred, he chose her as the only one "worthy" to house his god.

As Angel and [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] travel to England to find a cure, Wesley remains in Fred's bedroom with her, comforting her as she fights bravely, but slowly begins to die.  Angel learns that the only way to save Fred would be to draw Illyria back to the Deeper Well in England by using her sarcophagus as a beacon.  However, thousands of others would die as Illyria's essence cut across the world back to the Well.  Thus, Angel and Spike are forced to do nothing, deciding that Fred would not want this.

As she lies dying, Fred's mind begins to give way.  Nearing the end, she panics, stating that Feigenbaum, a stuffed rabbit named for mathematical physicist [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]] who studied [[chaos theory]], should be there.  When Wesley asks her who Feigenbaum is, Fred replies that she doesn't know.  Cradling her in his arms, Wesley stays with Fred until the moment she dies, after which her body is taken over by Illyria.  "Wesley, why can't I stay?" are Fred's last words.

According to Dr. Sparrow, Fred's soul is consumed by the fires of resurrection, which Wesley interprets upon overhearing as soul destruction, seemingly making it impossible for her to return from the dead or enjoy an afterlife, although the specifics of this process are not elaborated.  Later, though, Illyria states that there are remnants of Fred in the form of her memories, which are a source of confusion for Illyria.  On occasion, Illyria takes on the appearance of Fred in order to go about unnoticed and to deal with Fred's parents.  When Wesley dies, Illyria takes on Fred's form to comfort him and because she has Fred's form, the evil warlock Cyvus Vail underestimates her and she easily kills him.

Had ''Angel'' gotten a sixth season, Joss Whedon originally intended for Fred and Illyria to either be split in two as revealed by Amy Acker in an interview: "As I’m playing this new character now, it was just some stuff that he was going to do with her and bringing Fred back and getting to work with both characters",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= [[dreamwatch]] no.115 |publisher= [[Titan Magazines]] |date=April 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or for Illyria to take on more and more of Fred's memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218052015/http://www.stuffwelike.com/stuffwelike/2008/12/15/amy-acker-from-angel-to-dollhouse-part-1|title=Amy Acker: From Angel to Dollhouse (Part 1) {{!}} StuffWeLike.com|date=2008-12-18|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After the Fall ===
Fred seemingly reappears in the fifth, sixth and ninth issues of ''[[Angel: After The Fall]]'', manifesting as a transformation of [[Illyria (Angel)|Illyria]] into not just the physical appearance of Fred, but also her personality.  This happens a first time upon the initial fusion of [[Hell]] and [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] and then a second time upon a reunion of Illyria and [[Wesley Wyndam Price|Wesley]].  Issue #9 reveals that the Illyria and Fred essences have been struggling for dominance over their shared body, and that [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] has been trying to suppress Fred's manifestations (even going so far as to ask Angel for help), and admits that he would have kept Illyria away from the battle had he known Wesley was going to be present.  It is later revealed in ''Spike: After the Fall'' that seeing someone Fred cared for triggers the change, while dangerous situations transform her back into Illyria.  However, issue #14 explains that the Fred manifestations were just Illyria's interpretation of Fred; with these remnants lost, Illyria reverts to her true form.  Later the telepath [[List of minor Angel characters#Betta George|Betta George]] puts Wesley and Spike's memories (of Fred) into Illyria's brain to make her question her own actions.  Illyria later tries to behave in such a way as Fred would have wanted, and has taken on more of her characteristics (for example, in the ''After the Fall Epilogue'' she has scrawled on the walls of her rooms as Fred did, albeit listing methods of killing).

After the Senior Partners rewind time after Angel is killed by Gunn, Angel renames a wing of the L.A. public library the "Burkle Wyndam-Pryce Wing" in honor of Fred and Wesley.

=== ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' Season Nine ===

In [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine|''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' Season Nine]], Illyria is drained of her mystical energy and powers and is stuck in the physical appearance of Fred.  Illyria believes she should be dead and something inside her must be keeping her alive, and is able to scientifically read graphs to determine why [[Dawn Summers]] is dying. Illyria expresses human compassion for Severin, the person who drained her and who is now about to explode with power.  Illyria stays with Severin as he uses his powers to restore magic to the world which also vaporizes himself and Illyria.  Scott Allie later stated it was intentionally left open to interpretation as to whether Fred was influencing Illyria.

Buffy later expresses regret to her noble companion Eldre Koh on the need to destroy Illyria. Koh casts doubt on Buffy's knowledge of the elder ones.&lt;ref&gt;''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' Season 10 #2 (April 23 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resurrection ===

Fred is later discovered alive on the streets of London by Angel.&lt;ref&gt;''Angel &amp; Faith'' Season Ten #10 (January 7 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; It transpires that, when magic was restored, many aspects of the supernatural were "reset", resulting in the resurrection of both Fred and Illyria, sharing the same body.&lt;ref&gt;''Angel &amp; Faith'' Season Ten #11 (February 4 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Fred and Illyria thereafter remain with Angel for the remainder  of Season 10 and throughout ''Angel'' [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eleven|Season 11]].

==Powers and abilities==
Fred is a normal human woman with no supernatural abilities; however, her brilliant mathematical mind, immense knowledge of [[quantum physics]] and science, and a natural ability in designing inventions make her an important asset of [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]]'s team; [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce|Wesley]] once says, while addressing most of Angel's crew, "She's smarter than all of us put together".  Due to spending so many years in Pylea, she also has a limited knowledge of the Pylean language and culture.

During this time, Fred also acquires some reasonably good fighting skills, mainly with weapons such as stakes, guns, swords, knives, etc.  Later, when Jasmine takes over Los Angeles, she's forced to face down all of Los Angeles on her own, and it is shown that she is also able to hold her own unarmed, effortlessly taking out a few armed Jasminites, including one armed SWAT member.  It's seen in Season Three that she likes plants, actually talking to them during her period of mild insanity.  In the episode "[[Spin the Bottle (Angel episode)|Spin the Bottle]]," while she's under the effect of a magical spell, Fred is briefly fascinated with a fern.  After undergoing the transformation to [[Illyria (Angel)|Illyria]], she can talk to plants while at full power.

Fred is also portrayed as an innocent, unassuming young woman, which often leads people to underestimate her.  On many occasions, she has used this to her advantage, such as shocking Connor with a [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]] and knocking out a suspicious lab assistant at Wolfram &amp; Hart or in the third season in "[[That Old Gang of Mine (Angel episode)|That Old Gang of Mine]]" when she tricks Gunn's old gang into thinking she was going to kill Angel.  Also, she shows signs of great inner strength and an innate ability to survive on her own despite overwhelming circumstances.  This is shown in Season Four as she attempts to flee from Jasmine's followers, and earlier with her experiences in Pylea.

== Appearances ==

=== Canonical appearances ===
Fred has 64 canonical Angel appearances overall:
;''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'':
The character of Fred appeared in the final four Season Two episodes of ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' ("[[Belonging (Angel)|Belonging]]", "[[Over the Rainbow (Angel)|Over the Rainbow]]", "[[Through the Looking Glass (Angel)|Through the Looking Glass]]", "[[There's No Place Like Plrtz Glrb]]") before becoming a regular in Season Three, until her death in "[[A Hole in the World]]" (episode 15 season 5), although her body continued to appear as the 'host' of Illyria.  She appears in a total of 63 episodes (2001–2004).
;''[[Angel: After the Fall]]'':
In the final page of [[Angel: After the Fall]] #5, it appears that Illyria turns into Fred after noticing Wesley&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference | writer=[[Brian Lynch (writer)|Lynch, Brian]] | penciller=[[Franco Urru|Urru, Franco]] | story= | title=[[Angel: After the Fall]] | volume=1 | issue=5 | date=March 19, 2008 | publisher=[[IDW Publishing]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and issue 9 shows her transforming back and forth between Fred and Illyria.  However, this is later noted in issue #15 as a misguide.  Illyria had been in control of the body the entire time, as well as Fred being dead the entire time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference | writer=[[Brian Lynch (writer)|Lynch, Brian]] | penciller=[[Nick Runge|Runge, Nick]] | story= | title=[[Angel: After the Fall]] | volume=1 | issue=9 | date=June 19, 2008 | publisher=[[IDW Publishing]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten]]:
In the Angel &amp; Faith issue #10 Fred appears again. With the Return of the Magic her soul was restored. But [[Illyria (Angel)| Illyria]] as an [[Old Ones (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)| Old One]] her grace couldn't be destroyed and she was restored in Fred's vessel too.  Faith and Fred bond and become good friends, similar to [[Buffy Summers | Buffy]] and [[Willow Rosenberg | Willow]].

=== Non-canonical appearances ===
Fred also appears in the ''Angel'' expanded universe.  She is featured in a number of novels such as ''[[Sanctuary (Angel novel)|Sanctuary]]'', ''[[The Longest Night (Angel novel)|The Longest Night]]'', and ''[[Nemesis (Angel novel)|Nemesis]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15118">The '''Wolf Prize in Mathematics''' is awarded almost annually{{efn|The [http://www.wolffund.org.il/ Wolf Foundation website] describes the prize as annual; however, some prizes are split across years, while in some years no prize is awarded.}} by the [[Wolf Foundation]] in [[Israel]]. It is one of the six [[Wolf Prize]]s established by the Foundation and awarded since 1978; the others are in [[Wolf Prize in Agriculture|Agriculture]], [[Wolf Prize in Chemistry|Chemistry]], [[Wolf Prize in Medicine|Medicine]], [[Wolf Prize in Physics|Physics]] and [[Wolf Prize in Arts|Arts]]. According to a reputation survey conducted in 2013 and 2014, the Wolf Prize in Mathematics is the third most prestigious international academic award in mathematics, after the [[Abel Prize]] and the [[Fields Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=IREG Observatory on Academic Ranking and Excellence|title=IREG List of International Academic Awards|publisher=IREG Observatory on Academic Ranking and Excellence|location=Brussels|url=http://ireg-observatory.org/en/pdfy/IREG-list-academic-awards-EN.pdf|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zheng|first1=Juntao|last2=Liu|first2=Niancai|title=Mapping of important international academic awards|journal=Scientometrics|date=2015|volume=104|pages=763–791|doi=10.1007/s11192-015-1613-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the establishment of the Abel Prize, it was probably the closest equivalent of a "Nobel Prize in Mathematics", since the Fields Medal is awarded every four years only to mathematicians under the age of 40.
