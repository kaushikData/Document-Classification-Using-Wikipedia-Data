'''Adam Kotsko''' (born July 19, 1980) is an American writer, theologian, religious scholar, and translator, working chiefly in the field of [[political theology]]. He served as an Assistant Professor of Humanities at [[Shimer College]] in Chicago, which was absorbed into [[North Central College]] in 2017. He is especially known for his interpretative work on [[Slavoj Žižek]] and [[Giorgio Agamben]], as well as his writing on American popular culture.

Kotsko's better-known works include ''Why We Love Sociopaths'' (2012), ''Awkwardness'' (2010), and ''Žižek and Theology'' (2008). He has published three translations of works by the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben. Kotsko is also known for his blogging, now in its second decade.  He posts chiefly on a group blog titled ''An und für sich'', but continues to maintain his original blog, titled ''The Weblog''.&lt;ref name="giant"/&gt;  Prior to the rise of blogging, he had maintained a blog-like website titled ''The Homepage''.&lt;ref name="giant"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Adam Kotsko was born in [[Flint, Michigan]], and grew up in nearby [[Davison, Michigan|Davison]].&lt;ref name="normblog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="red"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itself.wordpress.com/2010/03/19/red-toryism-the-british-invasion/|title=Red Toryism: The British Invasion|date=2010-03-19|accessdate=2013-05-24|author=Adam Kotsko|work=An und für sich}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has credited his school experiences in Davison with giving him a love of literature.&lt;ref name="normblog"/&gt;

Kotsko earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree at [[Olivet Nazarene University]] in [[Bourbonnais, Illinois]], in 2002.&lt;ref name="normblog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="profile"/&gt; From there, he went on to the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]] (CTS), where he completed a [[Master of Arts]] degree in [[religious studies]] in 2005, with a thesis in the form of a translation and commentary on [[Jacques Derrida]]'s essay "Literature in Secret: An Impossible Filiation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/literature-in-secret-an-impossible-filiation-by-jacques-derrida-translation-and-commentary/oclc/76942979&amp;referer=brief_results|title=An Impossible Filiation by Jacques Derrida: Translation and Commentary|work=Worldcat|accessdate=2013-05-24}}. [http://itself.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/derrida-literature-in-secret.pdf Text of translation].&lt;/ref&gt;

Kotsko completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in theology, ethics, and culture at CTS in 2009.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Adam Kotsko |url=http://www.shimer.edu/aboutshimercollege/AdamKotsko.cfm |publisher=Shimer College |accessdate=2013-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708055425/http://www.shimer.edu/aboutshimercollege/AdamKotsko.cfm |archivedate=2012-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His doctoral dissertation was titled ''Atonement and Ontology''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Kotsko |first=Adam |year=2009 |title=Atonement and Ontology |degree=PhD |location=Chicago |publisher=Chicago Theological Seminary |oclc=456250141}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that an understanding of [[atonement in Christianity|atonement theory]] requires a social-relational [[ontology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itself.wordpress.com/2009/02/11/my-dissertation-atonement-and-ontology/|title=My Dissertation: "Atonement and Ontology"|accessdate=2013-05-24|date=2009-02-11|author=Adam Kotsko|work=An und für sich}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A modified version of his dissertation was published by [[Continuum International Publishing Group]] in 2010 under the title of ''The Politics of Redemption: The Social Logic of Salvation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Redemption: The Social Logic of Salvation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YBSSBoNdUXYC&amp;pg=PR7|page=vii|author=Adam Kotsko|year=2010|isbn=0567185664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual and teaching career==
{{Quote box|width=250px|align=right|Shimer’s approach admittedly may seem unrealistic. I believe, however, that it’s not a matter of “cost” in an abstract sense, but rather a matter of priorities. At Shimer, the priority is classroom instruction, and everything else takes a back seat to that.
&lt;br/&gt;—Adam Kotsko, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2012/05/03/essay-value-intense-discussion-based-instruction|title=The Immersion Method -- I|author=Adam Kotsko|work=Inside Higher Ed|date=2012-05-03|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Soon after completing his doctorate in 2009, Kotsko began teaching at [[Kalamazoo College]], a liberal arts college in Michigan.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt;  Initially a one-year appointment, it was subsequently extended to two.&lt;ref name="announce"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itself.wordpress.com/2011/04/25/an-announcement/|date=2011-04-25|accessdate=2013-05-24|author=Adam Kotsko|title=An announcement|work=An und für sich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kotsko graduation 2012 uncropped.jpg|thumb|Kotsko at the [[Shimer College]] commencement ceremony in Chicago in May 2012]]
In 2011, Kotsko was hired by [[Shimer College]], a very small [[great books|great-books]] college in Chicago.  He was one of three new Shimer professors hired that year, the school's largest intake of new faculty in more than a decade.&lt;ref name="hires"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shimer.edu/newsandevents/upload/2011-June-New-Faculty.pdf |title=Shimer Hires Three New Faculty Members |publisher=Shimer College |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=2013-05-24 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his first year, he participated in a major reworking of the school's upper-level core Humanities courses.  He also served on numerous committees in Shimer's unusual self-governance body, the Shimer College Assembly; in April 2013 he was additionally elected [[parliamentarian (consultant)|parliamentarian]] of the assembly.&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itself.wordpress.com/cvs/kotsko-cv/|title=CVs: Adam Kotsko|author=Adam Kotsko|work=An und für sich|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, after years of declining enrollment and financial difficulties, Shimer was acquired by North Central College in Naperville, Illinois, with plans to integrate it as the "Shimer Great Books School" within the college's academic structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.northcentralcollege.edu/news/2017/06/02/north-central-college-successfully-acquires-shimer-great-books-program|date=2017-06-02|accessdate=2017-09-04|title=North Central College successfully acquires Shimer Great Books program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kotsko is known for his writings on the interpretation of the philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]], whom he has credited for causing him to "break out of one particular intellectual ghetto and into another" by changing his self-identification from "non-Republican" to leftist.&lt;ref name="normblog"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://normblog.typepad.com/normblog/2004/08/the_normblog_pr.html|date=2004-08-06|title=The normblog profile 46: Adam Kotsko|work=Normblog|author=Norman Geras|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first published book was on Žižek, titled ''Žižek and Theology'' (the first volume of T&amp;T Clark's "Philosophy and Theology" series).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tandtclark.typepad.com/ttc/2008/05/new-release-ziz.html|date=2008-05-09|accessdate=2013-05-24|publisher=T&amp;T Clark|title=New Release: Zizek and Theology}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a somewhat unusual circumstance for academic writers, it was published in 2008, before he had completed his dissertation.&lt;ref name="giant"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/another-long-interview-this-time-with-zizek-brain-adam-kotsko/|work=HTML Giant|title=Another long interview (this time with Žižek brain Adam Kotsko)|author=Adam Robinson|date=2009-06-15|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, Kotsko published a more popular article on "How to Read Žižek" in the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Los Angeles Review of Books |url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=897 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905010858/http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=897 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-05 |title=How to Read Žižek |author=Adam Kotsko |date=2012-09-02 |accessdate=2013-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was republished in Italian by ''[[Internazionale (magazine)|Internazionale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Internazionale: Sommario 985|url=http://www.internazionale.it/sommario/985/|date=February 2013|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kotsko has also published three book-length translations of works by Italian theologian [[Giorgio Agamben]].  He has also published and delivered a number of papers on Agamben.  He has argued that Agamben's ''Highest Poverty'', his translation of which was published in 2013, is "ultimately about confronting neoliberalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itself.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/highest-poverty-paper-may-2013-v2.pdf|date=2013-05-21|accessdate=2013-05-24|author=Adam Kotsko|title=What St. Paul and the Franciscans Can Tell Us About Neoliberalism: On Agamben's The Highest Poverty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=250px|align=left|At its best, awkward humour is more than entertainment – it is a lesson in solidarity.&lt;br/&gt;—Adam Kotsko, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/dec/31/bond-mad-men-peep-show|date=2010-12-31|author=Adam Kotsko|accessdate=2013-05-24|title=The bond of the awkward}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kotsko has published three short books on popular culture, ''Awkwardness: An Essay'' (2010), ''Why We Love Sociopaths: A Guide to Late Capitalist Television'' (2012), and ''Creepiness'' (2015). Each book draws out a specific theme found in contemporary U.S. TV shows; ''Awkwardness'' addressing the curious rise of "awkward humor" in the 21st century, ''Why We Love Sociopaths'' addressing the trend toward a certain type of deeply antisocial protagonist, and ''Creepiness'' uses a Freudian lens to distinguish a discomfiting strain of popular culture from the topic of the first book. The trilogy was greeted with general acclaim, with the ''[[Oxonian Review]]'' declaring that "''Awkwardness'' is just what a work of philosophy should be",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|work=Oxonian Review|title=Awkwardness|author=Tom Cutterham|url=http://www.oxonianreview.org/wp/awkwardness/|accessdate=2013-05-24|date=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Scott Berkun]] describing ''Why We Love Sociopaths'' as "a second cousin to Postman’s classic ''Amusing Ourselves to Death''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scottberkun.com/2013/why-we-love-sociopaths-book-review/|author=Scott Berkun|title=Why We Love Sociopaths: Book Review|date=2013-03-16|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Why We Love Sociopaths'', however, also drew criticism for its admittedly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Why We Love Sociopaths: A Guide to Late Capitalist Television|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzssKbEQOIgC&amp;pg=PA2|author=Adam Kotsko|page=2|isbn=178099091X|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; non-technical use of the term [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|work=The Last Psychiatrist|url=http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2012/04/why_we_love_sociopaths.html|title=Why We Love Sociopaths|accessdate=2013-05-25|date=2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of ''Awkwardness'' has led to Kotsko being cited as an authority on awkwardness in the press, including by ''[[US News and World Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=US News and World Report|title=How to Deal with an Awkward Co-Worker|author=Aaron Guerrero|url=http://money.usnews.com/money/careers/articles/2013/05/01/how-to-deal-with-an-awkward-co-worker|date=2013-05-01|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Kotsko caused a firestorm of controversy when he tweeted that all white people, regardless of their ancestry or whether their ancestors owned slaves, are "complicit" in slavery.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/2/adam-kotsko-white-shimer-college-professor-all-whi/|title=Adam Kotsko, white Shimer College professor: All whites ‘complicit’ in slavery|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|work=The Washington Times|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the tweets were later deleted, Kotsko has said he stands by his statements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to this controversy, Kotsko has been named in an online "watch list" of college professors who discriminate against conservative students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.professorwatchlist.org/index.php/watch-list-directory/search-by-name/114-adam-kotsko|title=Adam Kotsko|last=Hern|first=Thomas|website=www.professorwatchlist.org|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Kotsko published a book about the figure of the [[Devil in Christianity]], ''The Prince of This World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=23793|title=The Prince of This World - Adam Kotsko|first=Stanford University|last=Press|website=www.sup.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously presented a paper before the [[American Academy of Religion]] on the influence of Agamben's writing on his thinking about the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itself.wordpress.com/2012/11/18/the-prince-of-this-world-thinking-the-devil-in-light-of-agambens-kingdom-and-the-glory/|title=The Prince of This World: Thinking the Devil in Light of Agamben’s Kingdom and the Glory|date=2012-11-18|author=Adam Kotsko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bahá'í News''''' was a monthly [[magazine]], published between December 1924 and October 1990, that covered "news and events in the worldwide [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í community]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ulrichsweb.com |url=http://ulrichsweb.com/ |publisher=[[ProQuest LLC]] |accessdate=14 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130190409/http://ulrichsweb.com/ |archivedate=30 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was first published as ''Bahá'í News Letter'' for 40 issues, changing to ''Bahá'í News'' from issue 41 onwards. A significant portion of the content of ''Bahá'í News'' touched upon worldwide developments in the Bahá'í community and the achievement of [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneering]] goals, as well as developments in the American Bahá'í community.&lt;ref name="AboutAmericanBaha'i"&gt;[http://tab.usbnc.org/Pages.aspx?id=508 About The American Bahá’í]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt; Digitized issues are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baha'i Library Online|url=http://bahai-library.com/bahai_news|accessdate=14 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101209082136/http://bahai-library.com/bahai_news| archivedate= 9 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[American Bahá'í]]'', a successor periodical which began publication in 1970 and is still in production, carries a particular focus on domestic developments in the American Baha'i community.&lt;ref name="AboutAmericanBaha'i"/&gt;

== Impact ==
''Bahá'í News'' was founded as part of [[Shoghi Effendi]]'s strengthening of the administration of the Bahá'í Faith in his role as [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardian]]. As [[William Garlington]] writes in his book ''The Baha'i Faith in America,''
"[E]mphasis was placed on developing positive methods of communication between the various Baha'i administrative institutions. Special attention was given to the proper relationship between local and national assemblies as well as the desired manner of interaction between the [[Spiritual Assembly#National Spiritual Assemblies|National Convention and National Spiritual Assembly]]. This effort was assisted by the national publication of ''Bahá'í News'' beginning in 1924, which provided all Bahá'í access to the Guardian's correspondence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garlington|first=William|title=The Baha'i Faith in America|page=106|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-98413-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further it “should become a great factor in promoting understanding, providing information on Bahá’í activity, both local and foreign, in stimulating interest, in combating evil influences, and in upholding and safeguarding the institutions of the Cause. It should be made as representative as possible, should be replete with news, up-to-date in its information, and should arouse the keenest interest among believers ... in every corner of the globe.”&lt;ref name="AboutAmericanBaha'i"/&gt;

==Similar periodicals==

Another periodical, ''[[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]]'', was initially named ''Bahá'í News'' as well, and its dates of publication (from 1910 to 1935) overlapped with ''Bahá'í News''.

'''Beit She'an''' ({{lang-he-n|בֵּית שְׁאָן}} ''{{Audio|He-Bet_Shean.ogg|Beth Šəān}}''; ''{{Audio|Ar-Bisan.ogg|Beesān}}'', ''Beisan'' or ''Bisan'')&lt;ref name="Shahin"/&gt; is a city in the [[Northern District (Israel)|Northern District]] of [[Israel]] which has played an important role in history due to its geographical location at the junction of the [[Jordan River|Jordan River Valley]] and the [[Jezreel Valley]]. In the Biblical account of the battle of the Israelites against the Philistines on [[Mount Gilboa]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://members.bib-arch.org/biblical-archaeology-review/38/2/2 Was King Saul Impaled on the Wall of Beth Shean?]&lt;/ref&gt; the bodies of [[King Saul]] and three of his sons were hung on the walls of Beit She'an ({{Bibleref2|1 Samuel 31:10-12}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishmag.co.il/39mag/shean/shean.htm Beit She'an, Archaeology in Israel]&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman times, Beit She'an was the leading city of the [[Decapolis]]. In modern times, Beit She'an serves as a regional center for the settlements in the [[Beit She'an Valley]].

The ancient city ruins are now protected within the [[National parks and nature reserves of Israel|Beit She'an National Park]].

==Geography==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 2382 Geography of Israel בית שאן.JPG|thumb|Ancient ruins of Beit She'an]]
Beit She'an's location has always been strategically significant, due to its position at the junction of the Jordan River Valley and the [[Jezreel Valley]], essentially controlling access from [[Jordan]] and the inland to the coast, as well as from [[Jerusalem]] and [[Jericho]] to the [[Galilee]].

Beit She'an is situated on [[Highway 90 (Israel)|Highway 90]], the north–south road which runs the length of Israel. The city stretches over an area of 7 square kilometers with a substantial national park in the north of the city. Beit She'an has a population of 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbn.org.il/aliyahpedia/community-housing-aliyahpedia/community-profiles/beit-shean/ Nefesh B'Nefesh Profiles: Beit She'an]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the town is under the administration of the [[Emek HaMaayanot Regional Council|Emek HaMa'ayanot Regional Council]].

==History==
===Prehistory (Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods)===
In 1933, archaeologist G.M. FitzGerald, under the auspices of the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]], carried out a "deep cut" on Tell el-Hisn ("castle hill"), the large [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]], or mound, of Beth She'an, in order to determine the earliest occupation of the site. His results suggest that settlement began in the [[Late Neolithic]] or [[Early Chalcolithic]] periods (sixth to fifth millennia BCE.)&lt;ref&gt;Braun, Eliot. ''Early Beth Shean (Strata XIX-XIII): G.M. FitzGerald's Deep Cut on the Tell'', p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Occupation continued intermittently throughout the Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods, with a likely gap during the Late Chalcolithic period.&lt;ref name="Braun, p.61-64"&gt;Braun, p.61-64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bronze Age===
[[File:BetShe'an - an ancient house of Egyptian governor.jpg|thumbnail|House of the Egyptian governor on Tell el-Husn]]

Settlement seems to have resumed at the beginning of the [[Early Bronze Age]] I (3200–3000) and continues throughout this period, is then missing during Early Bronze Age II, and then resumes in the Early Bronze Age III.&lt;ref name="Braun, p.61-64"/&gt;

A large cemetery on the northern mound was in use from the Bronze Age to [[Byzantine]] times.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Alan. ''The Topography and History of Beth Shean''. Philadelphia: 1930, p. v&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canaan]]ite graves dating from 2000 to 1600 BCE were discovered there in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Egyptian period====
After the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] conquest of Beit She'an by Pharaoh [[Thutmose III]] in the 15th century BCE, as recorded in an inscription at [[Karnak]],&lt;ref&gt;No. 110: bt š'ir. Mazar, Amihai. "Tel Beth-Shean: History and Archaeology." In ''One God, One Cult, One Nation''. Ed. R.G. Kratz and H. Spieckermann. New York: 2010, P. 239&lt;/ref&gt; the small town on the summit of the mound became the center of the Egyptian administration of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Mazar 242&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian newcomers changed the organization of the town and left a great deal of material culture behind. A large Canaanite temple (39 meters in length) excavated by the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]] (Penn Museum) may date from about the same period as Thutmose III's conquest, though the Hebrew University excavations suggest that it dates to a later period.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, 10; http://www.rehov.org/project/tel_beth_shean.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206130240/http://www.rehov.org/project/tel_beth_shean.htm |date=2012-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Artifacts of potential cultic significance were found around the temple. Based on a [[stele]] found in the temple, inscribed with Egyptian hieroglyphs, the temple was dedicated to the god Mekal.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 11&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important finds near the temple is the Lion and Dog stela, currently in the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem, which depicts two combat scenes between these two creatures. The [[Hebrew University]] excavations determined that this temple was built on the site of an earlier one.&lt;ref&gt;Mazar 247&lt;/ref&gt;

During the three hundred years of Egyptian rule (18th to 20th Dynasty), the population of Beit She'an appears to have been primarily Egyptian administrative officials and military personnel. The town was completely rebuilt, following a new layout, during the 19th dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Mazar 250&lt;/ref&gt; The Penn Museum excavations uncovered two important stelae from the period of [[Seti I]] and a monument of [[Rameses II]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 23–32&lt;/ref&gt; Pottery was produced locally, but some was made to mimic Egyptian forms.&lt;ref name="rehov.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rehov.org/project/tel_beth_shean.htm |title= Tel Beth Shean: An Account of the Hebrew University's Excavations |publisher= Rehov.org |date=  |accessdate= 2012-03-04 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120206130240/http://www.rehov.org/project/tel_beth_shean.htm |archive-date= 2012-02-06 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Canaanite goods existed alongside Egyptian imports, or locally made Egyptian-style objects.&lt;ref&gt;Mazar 256&lt;/ref&gt; The 20th Dynasty saw the construction of large administrative buildings in Beit She'an, including "Building 1500", a small palace for the Egyptian governor.&lt;ref&gt;Mazar 253&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th Dynasty, invasions of the "[[Sea Peoples]]" upset Egypt's control over the Eastern Mediterranean. Though the exact circumstances are unclear, the entire site of Beit She'an was destroyed by fire around 1150 BCE. The Egyptians did not attempt to rebuild their administrative center and finally lost control of the region.

===Iron Age===
According to the Hebrew Bible, around 1000 BCE the town became part of the [[Kingdom of Israel (United Monarchy)|larger Israelite kingdom]] under the rule of [[David]] and [[Solomon]]. {{Bibleref2|1 Kings 4:12}} refers to Beit She'an as part of the kingdom of Solomon, though the historical accuracy of this list is debated.&lt;ref&gt;Mazar 263&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[Iron Age]] I (1200-1000 BCE) Canaanite city was constructed on the site of the Egyptian center shortly after its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rehov.org/project/index.htm |title= The Beth-Shean Valley Archaeological Project |publisher= Rehov.org |date=  |accessdate= 2012-03-04 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120204204829/http://www.rehov.org/project/index.htm |archive-date= 2012-02-04 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] conquest of the northern kingdom of Israel under [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] (732 BCE) brought about the destruction of Beit She'an by fire.&lt;ref name="rehov.org"/&gt;

Minimal reoccupation occurred until the [[Hellenistic]] period.&lt;ref name="rehov.org"/&gt;

====Biblical narrative====
According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], around 1100 BCE Canaanite Beit She'an was conquered by the Philistines, who used it as a base of operations for further penetrations into Israel proper. During a subsequent battle against King [[Saul]] at nearby Mount Gilboa in 1004 BC, the Philistines prevailed and Saul together with three of his sons, [[Jonathan (1 Samuel)|Jonathan]], [[List of minor Old Testament figures, A–K#Abinadab|Abinadab]] and [[List of minor Old Testament figures, L–Z#Malchi-shua|Malchishua]], died in battle ({{Bibleref2|1 Samuel 31; 1 Chronicles 10}}). {{Bibleref2|1 Samuel 31:10}} states that "the victorious Philistines hung the body of King Saul on the walls of Beit She'an". King David was able to capture Beit Shea'an in a series of brilliant military campaigns that expelled the Philistines from the area, pushing them back to their southern coastal strongholds.

===Hellenistic period===
[[File:Thedecapolis.png|upright|thumb|Map of the [[Decapolis]] showing the location of Beit She'an, here called by its Greek name, Scythopolis]]

The [[Hellenistic]] period saw the reoccupation of the site of Beit She'an under the new name "Scythopolis" ([[Ancient Greek]]: Σκυθόπολις), possibly named after the [[Scythians|Scythian]] mercenaries who settled there as veterans. Little is known about the Hellenistic city, but during the 3rd century BCE a large temple was constructed on the tell.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 44&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown which deity was worshipped there, but the temple continued to be used during Roman times. Graves dating from the Hellenistic period are simple, singular rock-cut tombs.&lt;ref name="Rowe 49"&gt;Rowe 49&lt;/ref&gt; From 301 to 198 BCE the area was under the control of the [[Ptolemies]], and Beit She'an is mentioned in 3rd–2nd century BCE written sources describing the [[Syrian Wars]] between the Ptolemid and Seleucid dynasties. In 198 BCE the [[Seleucids]] finally conquered the region. The town played a role after the [[Maccabean]] Revolt: [[Josephus]] records that the Jewish High Priest [[Jonathan Apphus|Jonathan]] was killed there by [[Demetrius II Nicator]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus Ant. XIII, vi, 1,2; Rowe 45&lt;/ref&gt; The city was destroyed by fire at the end of the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;3&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Beit Shean Mosaic.jpg|thumb|Mosaic discovered in Synagogue in northern Beit Shean (Israel Museum)]]

===Roman period===
[[File:ROMAN THEATER BEIT SHE'AN.JPG|thumb|right|The Roman theatre]]
[[Image:Roman street in Bet She'an National Park, Israel.jpg|thumb|Roman cardo]]
[[File:Bet She'an hypocaust.jpg|thumb|right|Roman baths]]

In 63 BCE, [[Pompey]] made [[Judea]] a part of the Roman empire. Beit She'an was refounded and rebuilt by [[Aulus Gabinius|Gabinius]].&lt;ref name="Rowe 46"&gt;Rowe 46&lt;/ref&gt; The town center shifted from the summit of the mound, or tell, to its slopes. Scythopolis prospered and became the leading city of the [[Decapolis]], the only one west of the Jordan River.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.tau.ac.il/internationalMA/?p=2974 Alexander, Etruscans and a Field Trip to Beit Shean]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The city flourished under the "[[Pax Romana]]", as evidenced by high-level urban planning and extensive construction, including the best preserved Roman theatre of ancient [[Samaria]], as well as a [[hippodrome]], a [[cardo]] and other trademarks of the Roman influence. [[Mount Gilboa]], {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}} away, provided dark [[basalt]] blocks, as well as water (via an aqueduct) to the town. Beit She'an is said to have sided with the Romans during the Jewish uprising of 66 CE.&lt;ref name="Rowe 46"/&gt; Excavations have focused less on the Roman period ruins, so not much is known about this period. The Penn. University Museum excavation of the northern cemetery, however, did uncover significant finds. The Roman period tombs are of the ''loculus'' type: a rectangular rock-cut spacious chamber with smaller chambers (''loculi'') cut into its side.&lt;ref name="Rowe 49"/&gt; Bodies were placed directly in the ''loculi'', or inside sarcophagi which were placed in the ''loculi''. A [[sarcophagus]] with an inscription identifying its occupant in Greek as "Antiochus, the son of Phallion", may have held the cousin of [[Herod the Great]].&lt;ref name="Rowe 49"/&gt; One of the most interesting Roman grave finds was a [http://www.penn.museum/collections/object/297803 bronze incense shovel] with the handle in the form of an animal leg, or hoof, now in the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine period===
Copious archaeological remains were found dating to the [[Byzantine]] period (330–636 CE) and were excavated by the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]] from 1921–23. A rotunda church was constructed on top of the Tell and the entire city was enclosed in a wall.&lt;ref name="Rowe 50"&gt;Rowe 50&lt;/ref&gt; Textual sources mention several other churches in the town.&lt;ref name="Rowe 50"/&gt; Beit She'an was primarily Christian, as attested to by the large number of churches, but evidence of Jewish habitation and a Samaritan synagogue indicate established communities of these minorities. The pagan temple in the city centre was destroyed, but the [[nymphaeum]] and Roman baths were restored. Many of the buildings of Scythopolis were damaged in the [[Galilee earthquake of 363]], and in 409 it became the capital of the northern district, [[Palaestina Secunda]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; As such, [[Scythopolis (see)|Scythopolis]] (v.) also became the Metropolitan [[archdiocese]] of the province.

Dedicatory inscriptions indicate a preference for donations to religious buildings, and many colourful mosaics, such as that featuring the zodiac in the Monastery of Lady Mary, or the one picturing a menorah and shalom in the House of Leontius' Jewish synagogue, were preserved. A Samaritan synagogue's mosaic was unique in abstaining from human or animal images, instead utilising floral and geometrical motifs. Elaborate decorations were also found in the settlement's many luxurious villas, and in the 6th century especially, the city reached its maximum size of 40,000 and spread beyond its period city walls.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The Byzantine period portion of the northern cemetery was excavated in 1926. The tombs from this period consisted of small rock-cut halls with vaulted graves on three sides.&lt;ref name="Rowe 52"&gt;Rowe 52&lt;/ref&gt; A great variety of objects were found in the tombs, including terracotta figurines possibly depicting the Virgin and Child, many terracotta lamps, glass mirrors, bells, tools, knives, finger rings, iron keys, glass beads, bone hairpins, and many other items.&lt;ref name="Rowe 52"/&gt;

Important Christian personalites who lived or passed through Byzantine Scythopolis are St [[Procopius of Scythopolis]] (died July 7, 303 AD), [[Cyril of Scythopolis]] (ca. 525–559), St [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] (c. 310/320 – 403) and [[Joseph of Tiberias]] (c. 285 – c. 356) who met there around the year 355.

===Early Muslim period===
In 634, Byzantine forces were defeated by the [[Rashidun army|Muslim army]] of [[Umar|Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab]] and the city reverted to its Semitic name, being named Baysan in Arabic. The day of victory came to be known in Arabic as ''Yawm Baysan'' or "the day of Baysan."&lt;ref name="Shahin"/&gt; The city was not damaged and the newly arrived Muslims lived together with its Christian population until the 8th century, but the city declined during this period. Structures were built in the streets themselves, narrowing them to mere alleyways, and makeshift shops were opened among the colonnades. The city reached a low point by the 8th century, witnessed by the removal of [[marble]] for producing [[Calcium oxide|lime]], the blocking off of the main street, and the conversion of a main plaza into a cemetery.&lt;ref name=JVL&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Archaeology/Beitshean.html |title= Beit She'an |publisher= [[Jewish Virtual Library]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some recently discovered counter-evidence may be offered to this picture of decline. In common with state-directed building work carried out in other towns and cities in the region during the 720s,&lt;ref&gt;A. Walmsley, "Economic Developments and the Nature of Settlement in the Towns and Countryside of Syria-Palestine, ca. 565–800", Dumbarton Oaks Papers 61 (2007), especially pp. 344–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Baysan's commercial infrastructure was refurbished: its main colonnaded market street, once thought to date to the sixth century, is now known—on the basis of a mosaic inscription—to be a redesign dating from the time of the Umayyad caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik|Hisham]] (r. 724–43).&lt;ref&gt;E. Khamis, "Two wall mosaic inscriptions from the Umayyad market place in Bet Shean/Baysan", ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'' 64 (2001), pp. 159–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Ubayd al-Andalusi noted that the wine produced there was delicious.&lt;ref name="Shahin"/&gt;

On January 18, 749, Umayyad Baysan was completely devastated by a [[Golan earthquake of 749|catastrophic earthquake]]. A few residential neighborhoods grew up on the ruins, probably established by the survivors, but the city never recovered its magnificence. The city center moved to the southern hill where later the Crusaders built their castle.&lt;ref name="Death"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_Item_eng.asp?sec_id=17&amp;sub_subj_id=328&amp;id=662#as |title= Israel Antiquities Authority, Death of a City |publisher= Antiquities.org.il |date=  |accessdate= 2012-12-30 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130915130321/http://antiquities.org.il/article_Item_eng.asp?sec_id=17&amp;sub_subj_id=328&amp;id=662#as |archive-date= 2013-09-15 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerusalemite historian [[al-Muqaddasi]] visited Baysan in 985, during [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] rule and wrote that it was "on the river, with plentiful palm trees, and water, though somewhat heavy (brackish.)" He further noted that Baysan was notable for its [[indigo]], rice, [[date palm|date]]s and grape syrup known as ''dibs''.&lt;ref&gt;le Strange, 1890, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/18/mode/1up  18]–19.&lt;/ref&gt; The town formed one of the districts (''kurah'') of [[Jund al-Urdunn]] during this period.&lt;ref&gt;le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/30/mode/1up  30]&lt;/ref&gt; Its principal [[mosque]] was situated in the center of its marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/411/mode/1up  411]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crusader period===
[[File:Beyt-Shean-old-city-706.jpg|thumb|right|Crusader castle with moat and inner tower.]]

In the [[Crusade]]r period, the Lordship of Bessan was occupied by Tancred in 1099; it was never part of the [[Principality of Galilee]], despite its location, but became a royal domain of the [[Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem]] in 1101, probably until around 1120. According to the [[Lignages d'Outremer]], the first Crusader lord of Bessan once it became part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem was Adam, a younger son of Robert III de Béthune, peer of [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and head of the [[House of Bethune]]. His descendants were known by the family name ''de Bessan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Jerusalem Nobility|url = http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/JERUSALEM%20NOBILITY.htm#_Toc359684808|access-date = 18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It occasionally passed back under royal control until new lords were created, becoming part of the [[Belvoir Fortress (Israel)|Belvoir]] [[Crusader states|fiefdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://parks.org.il/BuildaGate5/general2/data_card.php?Cat=~30~~269867317~Card1~&amp;ru=&amp;SiteName=parks&amp;Clt=&amp;Bur=133421493 |script-title=he:גן לאומי בית שאן |publisher= Israel National Parks Authority |language= Hebrew |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120425124945/http://parks.org.il/BuildaGate5/general2/data_card.php?Cat=~30~~269867317~Card1~&amp;ru=&amp;SiteName=parks&amp;Clt=&amp;Bur=133421493 |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small Crusader fortress surrounded by a moat was built in the area southeast of the Roman theatre, where the diminished town had relocated after the 749 earthquake.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt; The fortress was destroyed by [[Saladin]] in 1183.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson"&gt;{{cite book |work= Archaeological Encyclopedia of the Holy Land |title= Beth Shean (city); Scythopolis |author=Avraham Negev and Shimon Gibson |year=2001 |location=New York and London |publisher=Continuum |page=86 |isbn=0-8264-1316-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1260 [[Battle of Ain Jalut]], retreating Mongol forces passed in the vicinity but did not enter the town itself.

===Mamluk period===
Under [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] rule, Beit She'an was the principal town in the district of [[Damascus]] and a relay station for the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)#Reign of Baybars|postal service]] between Damascus and [[Cairo]]. It was also the capital of [[sugar cane]] processing for the region. Jisr al-Maqtu'a, "the truncated/cut-off bridge", a bridge consisting of a single arch spanning 25 feet and hung 50 feet above a stream, was built during that period.&lt;ref name="Shahin164"&gt;Shahin, 2005, p. [https://books.google.co.il/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=-ZTtAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Jisr  164]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman period===
[[File:12בית שאן.jpg|thumb|Ottoman Saraya]]
During this period the inhabitants of Beit She'an were mainly Muslim. There were however some Jews. For example, the 14th century [[topographer]] [[Ishtori Haparchi]] settled there and completed his work ''Kaftor Vaferach'' in 1322, the first Hebrew book on the geography of Palestine.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9078948/Bet-Shean|title=Bet She'an|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 400 years of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, Baysan lost its regional importance. During the reign of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] when the [[Jezreel Valley railway]], which was part of the [[Haifa]]-Damascus extension of the [[Hejaz railway]] was constructed, a limited revival took place. The local peasant population was largely impoverished by the Ottoman feudal land system which leased tracts of land to tenants and collected taxes from them for their use.&lt;ref name="Shahin"/&gt;

The Swiss–German traveler [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt]] described Beisan in 1812 as "a village with 70 to 80 houses, whose residents are in a miserable state." In the early 1900s, though still a small and obscure village, Beisan was known for its plentiful water supply, fertile soil, and its production of olives, grapes, figs, almonds, apricots, and apples.&lt;ref name="Shahin"/&gt;

===British Mandate period===
Under the Mandate, the city was the center of the [[District of Baysan]].
According to a [[1922 census of Palestine|census]] conducted in 1922 by the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate authorities]], Beit She'an (Baisan) had a population of 1,941, consisting of 1,687 Muslims, 41 Jews and 213 Christians.&lt;ref name=Census1922&gt;Barron, 1923, p. [https://archive.org/stream/PalestineCensus1922/Palestine%20Census%20%281922%29#page/n8/mode/1up 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, [[Lawrence of Arabia]] noted that "Bisan is now a purely Arab village," where "very fine views of the river can be had from the housetops." He further noted that "many nomad and [[Bedouin]] encampments, distinguished by their black tents, were scattered about the riverine plain, their flocks and herds grazing round them."&lt;ref name="Shahin"/&gt; Beisan was home to a mainly [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi Jew]]ish community of 95 until 1936, when the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936–1939 Arab revolt]] saw Beisan serve as a center of Arab attacks on Jews in Palestine.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haaretz&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/831404.html|title=The other Beit She'an|author=Ashkenazi, Eli|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|date=2007-05-11|accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vie/Betshean.html|title=Virtual Israel Experience:Bet She'an|publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, after learning of the murder of his close friend and Jewish leader Haim Sturmann, [[Orde Wingate]] led his men on an offensive in the Arab section of Baysan, the rebels’ suspected base.&lt;ref name="Azure"&gt;{{cite web|title=Orde Wingate: Friend Under Fire|author=Michael B.

According to population surveys conducted in [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate Palestine]], Beisan consisted of 5,080 Muslim Arabs out of a population of 5,540 (92% of the population), with the remainder being listed as Christians.&lt;ref name="Domino"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.nsf/3822b5e39951876a85256b6e0058a478/be931279021bcfb4852563d20078d30b!OpenDocument |title=Settled Population Of Palestine |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=2009-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319013844/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.nsf/3822b5e39951876a85256b6e0058a478/be931279021bcfb4852563d20078d30b%21OpenDocument |archivedate=March 19, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, the surrounding [[District of Baysan]] consisted of 16,660 Muslims (67%), 7,590 Jews (30%), and 680 Christians (3%); and Arabs owned 44% of land, Jews owned 34%, and 22% constituted public lands.

Jewish forces and local Bedouins first clashed during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] in February and March 1948, part of [[Operation Gideon]],&lt;ref name="Shahin"/&gt; which [[Walid Khalidi]] argues was part of a wider [[Plan Dalet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Plan Dalet: Master Plan for the Conquest of Palestine|author=Khalidi, Walid|authorlink=Walid Khalidi|publisher=[[Journal of Palestine Studies]]|volume=18| issue = 1|date=Autumn 1988|pages=4–33|jstor=2537591|journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|doi=10.1525/jps.1988.18.1.00p00037}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Weitz]], a leading [[Yishuv]] figure, wrote in his diary on May 4, 1948 that, "The Beit Shean Valley is the gate for our state in the Galilee...[I]ts clearing is the need of the hour."&lt;ref name="Shahin"/&gt;

Beisan, then an Arab village, fell to the Jewish militias three days before the end of the Mandate.

===State of Israel===

Beit She'an was the hometown and political power base of [[David Levy (Israeli politician)|David Levy]], a prominent figure in Israeli politics.

During the [[Second Intifada]], in the [[2002 Beit She'an attack]], six Israelis were killed and over 30 were injured by two Palestinian militants, who opened fire and threw grenades at a polling station in the center of Bet She'an where party members were voting in the [[Likud]] primary.

==Archaeology and tourism==
[[File:Ktovet recov AA.jpg|thumb|[[Mosaic of Rehob|Rehov inscription]]]]
The [[University of Pennsylvania]] carried out excavations of ancient Beit She'an in 1921–1933.

[[Image:Beit She'an New Railway Station.jpg|thumb|New railway station, Beit She'an]]
Beit She'an had a railway station that opened in 1904 on the [[Jezreel Valley railway]] which was an extension of the [[Hejaz railway]]. This station closed together with the rest of the Jezreel Valley railway in 1948. In 2011–2016 the valley railway was rebuilt and the new [[Beit She'an Railway Station]], located at the same site as the historical station was opened. Passenger service offered at the station connects the city to Afula, Haifa and destinations in between. In addition to passenger service, the station also includes a freight rail terminal.

According to 2011 census, the Buddhist population in Nepal is 9% of the country population.{{cn|date=November 2018}} It has not been possible to assign with certainty the year in which Prince [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha]] (the birth name of the Buddha) was born, it is usually placed at around 623 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Edward Joseph|title=The Life of Buddha as Legend and History|year=1927 (AES Reprint: 2000)|publisher=Asian Educational Services (AES)|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-206-0979-4|pages=27–37|chapter=The Birth of Buddha}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2001 census, 10.74% of [[Nepal]]'s population practice Buddhism, consisting mainly of [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman-speaking]] ethnicities.&lt;ref name="Buddhism ethnic groups"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dahal |first=Dilli Ram |title=Social Composition of the Population: Caste/Ethnicity and Religion in Nepal |journal=Population Monograph of Nepal 2003 |year=2003 |volume=1 |pages=104–106 |url=http://cbs.gov.np/new/wp-content/uploads/2012/Population/Monograph/Chapter%2003%20%20Social%20Composition%20of%20the%20Population.pdf |publisher=Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Government of Nepal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107123918/http://cbs.gov.np/new/wp-content/uploads/2012/Population/Monograph/Chapter%2003%20%20Social%20Composition%20of%20the%20Population.pdf |archivedate=January 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nepal's hill and mountain regions Hinduism has absorbed Buddhist tenets to such an extent that in many cases they have shared deities as well as temples.

==Overview==

In Nepal the majority of people identify as Hindu, however, Buddhist influences are pervasive in most aspects of Nepali culture to an extent that Buddhist and Hindu temples are shared places of worship for peoples of both faith so that, unlike, in other countries, the distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism in Nepal is not always clear. During the reign of King Aṃśuvarman, the Nepalese princess [[Bhrikuti]] played a significant role in spreading and developing Buddhism in [[Tibet]]. Tibetan Buddhist architecture has long been influenced by Nepalese artists and sculptors like [[Araniko]]. The sacred Buddhist texts in Mahayana Buddhism are mainly written in the [[Ranjana alphabet]], the script of the [[Newars]], or scripts like [[Lantsa]], which are derived from Ranjana.

In traditional Nepalese Buddhism, there are nine special texts which are called the "Nine Dharma Jewels" (''Navagrantha''), and these are considered the nine books of Buddhism par excellence:

* [[Prajnaparamita|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra]]
* [[Gandavyuha|Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra]]
* [[Ten Stages Sutra]]
* [[Samadhiraja Sutra|Samādhirāja Sūtra]]
* [[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]
* [[Lotus Sutra]]
* Tathāgataguhya Sūtra
* [[Lalitavistara Sūtra]]
* [[Golden Light Sutra]]

Among the Tibeto-Burman-speaking peoples, [[Tibetan Buddhism]] is the most widely practised form. [[Newar Buddhism]] is a form of [[Vajrayana]] influenced by [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]]. Many Buddhist groups are also influenced by Hinduism. Buddhism is the dominant religion of the thinly populated northern areas, which are inhabited by Tibetan-related peoples, namely the [[Sherpa (people)|Sherpa]], Lopa, Manangi, [[Thakali people|Thakali]], Lhomi, [[Dolpa]] and Nyimba. They constitute a small minority of the country's population.

Ethnic groups that live in central Nepal such as the [[Gurungs]], [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]], [[Tamang]], [[Magar people|Magar]], Newars, [[Yakkha]], [[Thami]], [[Chhantyal]] and [[Chepang people|Chepang]] are also Buddhist. These ethnic groups have larger populations compared to their northern neighbours. They came under the influence of Hinduism due to their close contacts with the Hindu castes. In turn, many of them eventually adopted Hinduism and have been largely integrated into the caste system.

The [[Kirati people]], especially the [[Limbu people|Limbu]] and the [[Rai people]], have also adopted Tibetan Buddhist practises from their Buddhist neighbours. The [[Jirel people]], who are considered a Kirati, have also adopted Tibetan Buddhism.

==History==
[[File:Sky-and-prayer-flags.JPG|thumb|Buddhist prayer flags in Nepal.]]
Buddha was born as Prince Siddhartha in Nepal. He attained enlightenment under the Bodhi Tree in Bodh Gaya, in present-day Bihar, India. He there preached his teachings and thus Buddhism came into existence.

===Pre-Lichchavi Buddhism===
Emperor [[Ashoka]] of the [[Maurya Empire]] put up a [[pillars of Ashoka|pillar]] at Lumbini, the birthplace of the Buddha, in the second century BCE.&lt;ref name="lumbini.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.lumbini.org.uk/Theravada_Buddhism.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008115229/http://www.lumbini.org.uk/Theravada_Buddhism.htm |date=October 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Third Buddhist council]], Ashoka missionaries to Nepal.&lt;ref name="lumbini.org.uk" /&gt; It is also believed that Ashoka went to Patan and had four [[stupa]]s built there. It is believed that his daughter [[Charumati]] established the village of [[Chabahil]], which is located between Kathmandu and Boudha.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}.

===Buddhism during the Licchavi period (400-750)===
The Licchavi period saw the flourishing of both Hinduism and Buddhism in Nepal. Excellent examples of Buddhist art of the period are the half-sunken Buddha in Pashupatinath, the sleeping Vishnu in Budhanilkantha, and the statue of Buddha and the various representations of Vishnu in Changu Narayan.

Another Buddhist text, the Manjushrimula Kalpa, mentioned Manadeva as the King of [[Nepal Mandala]]. Researchers believe the Mulasarvastivadavinaya was written in the 2nd century CE, and that the Manjushriulakalpa was written during Manadeva's reign. The Swayambhu Purana, the ancient Buddhist Purana text, and a Licchavi inscription all mentioned Nepal Mandala.

Buddhist inscriptions and chronicles and Tibetan sources also record a few tantric Buddhist deities, namely [[Akshobhya]], [[Amitabha]], [[Vajrayogini]], [[Vajrabhairava]], [[Usnisavijaya]] and [[Samantabhadra]]. Strong influence from [[Animism]] resulted in belief in Buddhist deities such as the Pancaraksas.

Religious tolerance and syncretism were stressed during the Licchavi period. [[King Manadeva]] paid homage at both Hindu and Buddhist sites. His family subsequently found expression for their beliefs in various religions.

The worship of the Caitya and the Rath Jatra cart festival of [[Avalokitesvara]] were introduced around this period. Many ancient sites in the Kathmandu Valley were identified with major Buddhist [[Cetiya|Caityas]], such as [[Swayambhu]], [[Boudhanath]], Kathmandu and the four "Ashoka" stupas of Patan, and another two hundred stone [Cetiya|Caityas] dating from the Licchavi Period, were testified to the widespread antiquity of [Cetiya|Caitya] worship.

It is possible that this practice, in its earliest incarnation, was related to the worship of stones, which may have originated in the early, rival [[Kirat]]a inhabitants of the Valley, prior to the [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavi]]s. According to one of the earliest Licchavi inscriptions, Caitya worship ordinarily consisted of ritual circumambulation of the caitya and offering standard items such as incense, colored powder, oil lamps and ablutions. At times, the inscriptions indicate, it could even involve resurfacing an existing Caitya and covering the new surface with many elaborate paintings.

Caitya worship was an important factor in bringing more of the proto-Newar tribal inhabitants into the Buddhist fold, as it was a [[Buddhist devotion|devotional practice]] designed for the general public. Thus, the masses probably began practicing the cart festival of [[Avalokitesvara]]/Matsyendranath ([[Jana Baha Dyah Jatra]] and [[Bunga Dyah]] Jatra) during the latter half of the seventh century AD.

This festival was celebrated by hundreds or even thousands of people, who helped to construct and transport a huge, wheeled cart that bore the image of [[Avalokitesvara]] for several days or weeks along a specific route. The introduction of this festival must have been an instant success among the majority of the Kathmandu Valley population. This strengthened Buddhism's standing in relation to the other Hindu and Animist faiths of the Valley at the time.

Forty stone inscriptions made some mention of Buddhism throughout the Licchavi period. Most of the references are concerned with monasticism. However, almost nothing is known about the day-to-day life in the Vihara monasteries or how they functioned administratively.

The names of the fifteen Buddhist monasteries are known, and it is clear from the context in which some of these are named that they are among the most important religious sites of that time. It is not known for certain what schools of Buddhism were most prominent at the time. But the strongest early influences (aside from an even earlier probable substratum of Pali Buddhism) probably came from the Mahasanghika, Sammitiya and the Sarvastivada schools. The Makhyamaka and Yogacara schools were thought to be more influential in the later period with the emergence and growth of the Vajrayana school.

Inscriptional evidence also proves that there was a string of traditional methods of making religious gifts. These offerings were used for earning blessing and making merit, and the women of the Buddhist seem to have taken the lead in offering these gifts. Strikingly, parallel points within the Buddhist cave contain inscriptions of Maharashtra, which predated the Licchvi Nepal. The references in the Licchavi inscriptions to the Mahayana and Vajrayana will be mentioned below in connection with Buddhist art and notable Buddhist figures of the Licchavi period.

===Buddhism during the Licchavi period (600-1200)===

[[File:AmitabhMonastery.jpg|thumb|[[Amitabh Monastery]] in Nepal.]]
[[File:British Museum Asia 41-2.jpg|thumb|The Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, gilded bronze. Nepal, 16th century CE]]
A Licchavi king, [[Amshuverma]], married his daughter [[Bhrikuti]] to the ruler of Tibet, King [[Songtsen Gampo]]. According to legend, she received the begging bowl of the Buddha as part of her wedding dowry. It is believed that she introduced Buddhism into Tibet. she is also believed as a reincarnation of the Green Tara of Tibetan Buddhism, who is seen in many Buddhist [[Thangka]]s. Lichhavi period is known as the golden time for Buddhism.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

===Buddhism during the Malla dynasty (1200–1769)===

The Malla dynasty saw to the golden period of the syncretism of Hindu and Buddhist art forms by the [[Newar]]. The [[Paubha]], the Newar counterpart of the Tibetan Buddhist Thangka, flourished in this period.

During the reign of Jayasthiti Malla, after implementation of Manudharmasastra, celibate monks were banned from practicing in Nepal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} This gave way to the decelibate [[Newar Buddhism]]. Because of this, Theravada Buddhism was lost in Nepal only to be revitalized in the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lumbini.org.uk/bd_n_thera_t.html|title=Theravada Buddhism in Modern Nepal |publisher=Lumbini Nepalese Buddha Dharma Society (UK)|accessdate=22 May 2013|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism during the Shah dynasty (1769–1846)===

The Shah dynasty saw the decline of Buddhism in [[Nepal]] where it eventually merged with [[Hinduism]] as the Hindu [[Gurkha]] rose to prominence.{{cn|date=June 2016}} In the north, the [[Mustang (kingdom)|Mustang]] kingdom ruled by the Buddhist Lopa and the [[Thakali people|Thakali]] saw to the flourishing of Vajrayana ([[Tibetan Buddhism]]) in the North.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

===Buddhism during the Rana dynasty (1846–1951)===

There is an incorrect assumption that, due to perceived similarity to tantric Hinduism, that Modern Newar Buddhism in [[Nepal]] has largely been absorbed into mainstream [[Hinduism]]. However, Newar Buddhism has retained a distinct identity, and nearly all practices, art forms and castes remain. In the north, people of Tibetan origin continued to be the much-unchanged practises of Tibetan Buddhism, especially in the case of the Nyimba of Northwest [[Nepal]]. On the other hand, the [[Thakali people|Thakali]], who had traditionally played an important role in the Nepali society but yet retained [[Tibetan Buddhism]], have begun to embrace Hinduism as well in the recent years.

It is significant to note that during the autocratic [[Rana dynasty|Rana regime]], several [[Theravada Buddhist]]s were banished from Nepal for preaching Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhistview.com/site/epage/3035_225.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030506110140/http://www.buddhistview.com/site/epage/3035_225.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 May 2003|title=buddhistview.com|publisher=|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parami.org/duta/nepal.htm|title=Dhammaduta: The Theravada Bhikkhu Sangha in Nepal|publisher=|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Banishment of Buddhist monks from Nepal]] in 1926 and 1944 was prompted by an attempt to suppress the revival of Theravada Buddhism which began in the 1920s. Also, the rediscovery of Lumbini, the birthplace of Buddha, occurred in this era with contributions from among others, General Khadga Sumsher Rana.

===Shah Dynasty (1951–2006)===

After the overthrow of the Rana dynasty in 1951, Buddhism gradually developed in the country. Theravada Buddhists played a greatly significant role for the Buddhist revival campaign in modern Nepal since the 1920s. This revival movement has changed Buddhism from a religion of some ethnic groups and castes to going beyond the caste and ethnic religion in Nepal. Presently, there are three main Buddhist schools; [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Newar Buddhism]] and [[Theravada Buddhism]].

Tourism is an important factor for promoting Nepali Buddhism to the world. Every year, [[Kathmandu]] can receive more than 10,000 travellers from all over the world just to visit the Boudha Stupa [[Boudhanath]] and the Swyambhu Maha Chaitya [[Swayambhunath]] stupas. These are the remarkable and significant architectural sites, which are only found in Nepal. Apart from these two main Buddhist monuments there are hundreds of Buddhist monuments in Kathmandu and in other main cities of Nepal.

===Republic of Nepal (2006-present)===

Nepal officially became a secular state in 2006. All religions in Nepal now have equal opportunities to propagate according to their belief.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3276">The ''Chitrakathi'' is the name of an occupational caste whose traditional livelihood was to narrate stories aided with pictures sojourning various places.  
== History ==

The term ''Chitrakathi'' is the conjunction of two words: ''chitra'' meaning picture and ''katha'' meaning story. With this application, a Chitrakathi is the one who narrates stories with a visual aid. Thereby one can imagine the primitiveness of this art. In tribal's life there is a long-standing tradition of chitrakathi's paintings. Wall paintings of Saora, Gaund, Pradhan are extremely popular in India and abroad.  It’s an almost extinct art form practised by the Thakkar tribal community of Maharashtra. Chitrakathi artists are a community of migrating story tellers found all over Maharashra and some parts of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. They made a series of single sheets of paintings. All paintings belonging to one story were kept in a bundle called pothi. The Theme of Chitrakathi paintings include stories on local versions of Ramayana and [[Mahabharata]] and mythical themes. Use of brownish tones of stone colors gives a remarkable effect. Figures in paintings were generally stylized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gottesbild.com/blog/?p=1315|title=Chitrakathi Paintings.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

"Chitra" means picture and "katha" means story and the exponent called Chitrakathi is the person who narrates the story with the aid of some visual support. "Broadly speaking,Chitrakatha is identified in three forms, Leather shadow puppets, Stringed wooden puppets and Picture stories. The latter only, now, is identified as 'Chitrakathi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Reviving-a-dying-art-form-with-visuals-of-another/articleshow/16361065.cms|title=Reviving a dying art form with visuals of another.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists use the term "Pothi" to set of pictures which contains 30 to 50 pages arranged in chronological order. These pages are unbound like pages of Ramayana and Mahabharata previously one artist used to keep 40 to 50 Pothis but today fortunately 15 to 20 Pothis are in good condition. Some pothis date back to 300 years whereas some 50 to 60 years old. The art of story telling may become extinct in less than a decade and half unless effective steps are taken by the government to preserve it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.konkanonline.com/art/chitrakathi.html|title=Chitrakathi.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artists and awards ==

Some prominent Chitrakathi artists are Jayashree Patankar, Alaka Bhandiwad, Indira Seshadri, Meenakshi Madan, Rajasri Manikandan, V Shanmughapriya, Shoba Rajagopalan, S Suresh and Vaishnavi Srikanth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Reviving-a-dying-art-form-with-visuals-of-another/articleshow/16361065.cms|title=Reviving a dying art form with visuals of another.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/01/02/stories/2003010200840300.htm|title=Impressions of myth and nature.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clemenza, rielaborazione romana da originale greco del IV secolo ac., testa di reaturo, inv. 2260.JPG|thumb|Ancient statue of Clementia in the [[Vatican Museums#Museo Chiaramonti|Museo Chiaramonti]]]]

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Clementia''' was the goddess of [[clemency]], [[leniency]], [[mercy]], [[forgiveness]], [[penance]], [[redemption (theology)|redemption]], [[absolution]] and [[salvation]].&lt;ref name="Jordan2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Jordan|title=Dictionary of Gods and Goddesses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aqDC5bwx4_wC&amp;pg=PA67|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0985-5|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was defined as a celebrated virtue of [[Julius Caesar]], who was famed for his forbearance, especially following [[Caesar's civil war]] with [[Pompey]] from 49 BC. In 44 BC, a temple was consecrated to her by the [[Roman Senate]], possibly at Caesar's instigation as Caesar was keen to demonstrate that he had this virtue.

In a letter to his friend [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]], [[Cicero]] is discussing Caesar's ''clementia'': "You will say they are frightened. I dare say they are, but I'll be bound they're more frightened of Pompey than of Caesar. They are delighted with his artful clemency and fear the other's wrath." Again in ''Pro rege Deiotaro'' (For King Deiotarus) Cicero discusses Caesar's virtue of ''clementia''.

There is not much information surrounding Clementia's cult; it would seem that she was merely an abstraction of a particular virtue, one that was revered in conjunction with revering Caesar and the [[Roman Empire|Roman state]]. Clementia was seen as a good trait within a leader, it also the [[Latin]] word for "humanity" or "forbearance". This is opposed to ''Saevitia'' which was savagery and bloodshed. Yet, she was the Roman counterpart of [[Eleos]], (not to be confused with [[Soteria (mythology)|Soteria]]), the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] of mercy and forgiveness who had a shrine in [[Athens]].

In traditional imagery, she is depicted holding a branch (possibly an [[Olive branch|olive tree branch]]) and a scepter and may be leaning on a column.

'''Daniel Clasen''', in [[Latin]] '''Danielis Clasenius''' or '''Clasenus''' (1 May 1622, [[Lüneburg]] – 20 November 1678,&lt;ref&gt;J.F. von Schulte, ''Die Geschichte der Quellen und Literatur des canonischen Rechts'' (The Lawbook Exchange, 2000, 2008), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helmstedt]]), was a German [[political theorist]], [[religious scholar]], and [[classicist]].

His treatises, written in Latin, dealt with law, jurisprudence, religion, and politics. Clasen was one of the earliest theorists of [[political religion]], though preceded by [[Tommaso Campanella]] (1568–1639),&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Trousson, ''Le thème de Prométhée dans la littérature européenne'' (Librairie Droz, 1964, 3rd ed. 2001) p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; and argued against [[Accommodation (religion)|accommodation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Mulson, "Cartesianism, Skepticism and Conversion to Judaism: The Case of Aaron d'Antan," in ''Secret Conversions to Judaism in Early Modern Europe'' (Brill, 2004), p. 138, note 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clasen was a major [[mythographer]] of the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;Trousson, ''Le thème de Prométhée'', p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote [[commentary (philology)|commentaries]] on classical texts such as the so-called ''[[Cebes|Tablet of Cebes]]'' ''(Cebetis Tabula vitae humanae)'', for which he provided a Latin translation.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Clasen, ''Cebetis Tabula vitae humanae recte instituendae de scriptionem continens cum commentariis'' (1652 edition), full text [https://books.google.com/books?id=crFAAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false online], with parallel Greek text and Latin translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Clasen's works include:
* ''Commentarius in constitutiones criminales Caroli V. Imperatoris''
* ''De religione politica''
* ''De iure legitimationis exercitatio iuridica''
* ''Exercitatio iuridica de patria potestate''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4741">'''Eco-Kashrut''', also called the '''Eco-Kosher''' movement, is a movement to extend the [[Kashrut]] system, or [[Jewish]] dietary laws, to address modern environmental, social, and ethical issues, and promote [[sustainability]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/practices/Ritual/Kashrut_Dietary_Laws/Themes/Contemporary_Themes/Eco-Kashrut.shtml Arthur O. Waskow, "Eco-Kashrut: Environmental Standards for What and How We Eat", ''MyJewishLearning'', Originally Published in the ''Jerusalem Report''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

This movement began in the 1970s among American [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist Jews]], and eco-kashrut or eco-kosher approaches enjoyed a resurgence in the 1990s with the work of [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] rabbi, author, and activist [[Arthur Waskow]]. A third wave of the eco-kashrut or eco-kosher movement began in the mid-2000s, spurred on in part by a series of kosher production facility scandals.&lt;ref name=ODJ&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Katz |first=Emily Alice |editor1=Adele Berlin |editor2=Maxine Grossman |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictinoary of Jewish Religion|title=Ecokosher |url= |language=English |edition=2nd |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |oclc=714892003 |isbn=9780199759279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi|Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]], a founder of the [[Jewish Renewal|Jewish Renewal Movement]], is credited with coining and developing ''eco-kashrut'' in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=Kaplan /&gt; He articulated eco-kashrut as an evolving set of practices that extend beyond traditional [[kashrut]] by taking the human and environmental costs of food production and consumption into account when deciding what to eat or not eat.&lt;ref name=Kaplan&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan |first=Dana Evan |title=Contemporary American Judaism: Transformation and Renewal|publisher=Columbia University Press |publication-place=New York |publication-date=2009 |pages=57–106 |chapter=Chapter 2: The Reengagement with Spirituality |oclc=620044421}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Posen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Posen |first=Marie-Josee |title=Beyond New Age: Jewish Renewal's Reconstruction of Theological Meaning in the Teachings of Rabbi Z.

==Contemporary movement==
More recently the movement has been championed by other Kosher-keeping Jews who strive to eat only food that has been ethically and sustainably produced, and ideally, locally sourced.&lt;ref name="schott"&gt;[http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/eco-kosher/ "Eco-Kosher", Schott's Vocab, New York Times, May 14, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Eco-Kashrut also finds expression in the sharing of sustainable [[shabbat]] meals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/may/08/local/me-kosher-jewish8 "'Eco-kosher' Jews have an appetite for ethical eating", ''LA Times'', May 8, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eco-Kashrut is connected with [[Magen Tzedek]] ("Shield of Justice"), an additional certification for food advocated by the [[Rabbinical Assembly]] and others within the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative movement]] that aims to address health, safety, and other labor issues in food production.&lt;ref name="schott" /&gt; Amid opposition from the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox movement]], no products have been certified to carry the seal as of August 2017.&lt;ref name=MT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.magentzedek.org/for-consumers/|title=For Customers|website=Magen Tzedek|access-date=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ForwardStalled"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://forward.com/articles/176814/magen-tzedek-ethical-kosher-seal-stalled-amid-orth/?p=all| title=Magen Tzedek, Ethical Kosher Seal, Stalled Amid Orthodox Opposition| author=Berkman, Seth | date= May 20, 2013| work= The Forward |access-date=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were named ''Elefante'' – which morphed to Elephanta – by the colonial Portuguese when they found elephant statues on it. They established a base on the island, and its soldiers damaged the sculpture and caves. The main cave (Cave 1, or the Great Cave) was a Hindu place of worship until the Portuguese arrived, whereupon the island ceased to be an active place of worship.&lt;ref name=britelephanta/&gt; The earliest attempts to prevent further damage to the Caves were started by British India officials in 1909.&lt;ref name=collins25/&gt; The monuments were restored in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=britelephanta/&gt; In 1987, the restored Elephanta Caves were designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

The island is {{convert|2.4|km|abbr=on}} in length with two hills that rise to a height of about {{convert|150|m|abbr=on}}. A narrow deep ravine separates the two hills, and runs from north to south. On the west, the hill rises gently from the sea and stretches east across the ravine and rises gradually to the extreme east to a height of {{convert|173|m|abbr=on}}. Forest growth with clusters of mango, tamarind, and [[Millettia pinnata|karanj]] trees cover the hills with scattered palm trees. The fore shore is made up of sand and mud with mangrove bushes on the fringe. Landing quays sit near three small hamlets known as Set Bunder in the north-west, Mora Bunder in the northeast, and Gharapuri or Raj Bunder in the south.&lt;ref name=geo/&gt;

There are five rock-cut caves in the western hill and a brick stupa on the eastern hill. The eastern hill has two Buddhist mounds, and is called the Stupa hill. Close to the five western hill caves, are Cave 6 and 7 on the eastern hill.

==History==

The ancient history of the island is unknown in either Hindu or Buddhist records. Archeological studies have uncovered many remains that suggest the small island had a rich cultural past, with evidence of human settlement by possibly the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;&lt;ref name = "historic_places"/&gt; The Elephanta site was first occupied by [[Hinayana]] Buddhists, before the arrival of the Brahmans to the island, to raise a large stupa to the [[Buddha]] with seven smaller stupas around it, probably around the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;"Long before the Brahmans selected Elephanta for their temple to the Great God, the Hinayana Buddhists came to the island for more or less the same purpose, to raise a monument to the Buddha. To the early Buddhists a stupa was an object of supreme veneration..." in {{cite book |last1=Kail |first1=Owen C. |title=Elephanta, the island of mystery |date=1984 |publisher=Taraporevala |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ylweAAAAMAAJ |p=19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt; Coins of the Kshatrapas ([[Western Satraps]]) dating to the 4th century CE were found on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Archeological Survey of India [[:File:Elephanta Caves information board.JPG|on-site notice]]&lt;/ref&gt; The regional history is first recorded in the Gupta Empire era, but these do not explicitly mention these caves.&lt;ref name = "historic_places"/&gt; This has made the origins and the century in which Elephanta caves were built a subject of a historic dispute. They have been variously dated, mostly between from late 5th to late 8th century AD, largely based on the dating of other cave temples in the Deccan region.&lt;ref name = "historic_places"/&gt; Colonial era historians suggested that the caves were built by the [[Rashtrakutas]] in 7th century or after, a hypothesis primarily based on some similarities with the [[Ellora Caves]].&lt;ref name = "historic_places"/&gt; This theory has been discredited by later findings.&lt;ref name="berkson3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spink2005p182"/&gt;

According to Archaeological Survey of India and UNESCO, the site was settled in ancient times and the cave temples were built between 5th and 6th century.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;&lt;ref name = "historic_places"/&gt; Contemporary scholars generally place the completion of the temples to the second quarter of the 6th century and as a continuation of the period of artistic flowering in the [[Gupta Empire]] era.&lt;ref name="Spink2005p182"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "historic_places"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Michell2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Michell|title=Elephanta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2iExAQAAIAAJ|year=2015|publisher=Jaico|isbn= 978-8-184-95603-0 |pages=1–4, 30–33, 96–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scholars attribute these Cave temples to king Krishnaraja of the [[Kalachuri dynasty]].&lt;ref name="berkson3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1988p443"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Presence of Siva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjqfkgD6YCAC&amp;pg=PA443 |year=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass  |isbn=978-81-208-0491-3|pages=443–445}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dating to a mid 6th century completion and it being a predominantly Shiva monument built by a Hindu Kalachuri king is based on numismatic evidence, inscriptions, construction style and better dating of other Deccan cave temples including the [[Ajanta Caves]], and the more firm dating of Dandin's ''Dasakumaracarita''.&lt;ref name="Spink2005p182"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carmel Berkson|author2=Wendy Doniger|author3=George Michell|title=Elephanta: The Cave of Shiva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RYqq7um0hcC|year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press (Motilal Banarsidass, Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-1284-0|pages=3–6, 47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sara L.

According to Charles Collins, the significance of the Elephanta Caves is better understood by studying them in context of ancient and early medieval Hindu literature, as well as in the context of other Buddhist, Hindu and Jain cave temples on the subcontinent. The historic Elephanta artwork were inspired by the mythology, concepts and spiritual ideas found in the Vedic texts on Rudra and later Shiva, the epics, the Puranas and the Pashupata Shaivism literature corpus of [[Hinduism]] composed by the 5th-century. The panels reflect the ideas and stories widely accepted and well known to the artists and cave architects of India by about 525 CE. The mythology varies significantly in these texts and has been much distorted by later interpolations, but the Elephanta Cave panels represent the narrative version most significant in the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Dillard Collins|title=The Iconography and Ritual of Siva at Elephanta: On Life, Illumination, and Being|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQNi6kAGJQ4C |year=1988|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-773-0|pages=31–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Collins | first=Charles D. | title=Elephanta and the Ritual of the Lakulīśa-Pāśupatas | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | publisher=American Oriental Society | volume=102 | issue=4 | year=1982 | doi=10.2307/601969 | pages=605–609}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panels and artwork express through their eclecticism, flux and motion the influence of Vedic and post-Vedic religious thought on Hindu culture in mid 1st millennium CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carmel Berkson|author2=Wendy Doniger|author3=George Michell|title=Elephanta: The Cave of Shiva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RYqq7um0hcC|year =1999|publisher= Princeton University Press (Motilal Banarsidass, Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-1284-0|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Caves completion in the 6th century, Elephanta became popular regionally as Gharapuri (village of caves). The name is still used in the local [[Marathi language]].&lt;ref name="berkson41"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carmel Berkson|author2=Wendy Doniger|author3=George Michell|title=Elephanta: The Cave of Shiva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RYqq7um0hcC|year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press (Motilal Banarsidass, Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-1284-0|pages=41–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a part of the Gujarat Sultanate rulers, who ceded it to the Portuguese merchants in 1534. The Portuguese named the island "Elephanta Island" for the huge rock-cut stone statue of an elephant, the spot they used for docking their boats and as a landmark to distinguish it from other islands near Mumbai. The elephant statue was damaged in attempts to relocate it to England, was moved to the Victoria Gardens in 1864, was reassembled in 1914 by Cadell and Hewett, and now sits in the [[Jijamata Udyaan]] in Mumbai.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref name="historic places"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Trudy Ring |author2=Robert M.

Scholars are divided who most defaced and damaged the Elephanta Caves. According to Macneil, the monuments and caves were already desecrated during the Sultanate rule, basing his findings on the Persian inscription on a door the leads to the grand cave.&lt;ref name="berkson41"/&gt; In contrast, others such as Ovington and Pyke, link the greater damage to be from the Christian Portuguese soldiers and their texts which state they used the caves and statues as a firing range and for target practice.&lt;ref name="berkson41"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Campbell|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pb8IAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA84|year=1882|publisher=Government Central Press|pages=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ramaswami42&gt;{{cite book|author=N.

It was the Marathas who tried to remove that plaster, according to this theory which Wendy Doniger states is "possibly true", and it was therefore the Marathas that caused damage to the artwork in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="berkson41"/&gt;

The Portuguese ceded the island in 1661 to the colonial British, but by then the Caves had seen considerable damage. The Portuguese had also removed and then lost an inscription stone from the caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Collins | first=Charles D. | title=Elephanta and the Ritual of the Lakulīśa-Pāśupatas | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | publisher=American Oriental Society | volume=102 | issue=4 | year=1982 | doi=10.2307/601969 | page=605 footnote 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frontline"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2423/stories/20071207505906600.htm |title=Simply grand|last=Benoy K.

The Elephanta caves re-emerged as a center of Hindu worship, and according to British administration records, the government charged the pilgrims a temple tax at least since 1872. In 1903, the Hindus petitioned the government to waive this fee, which the British agreed to on three Shiva festival days if Hindus agreed. The Elephants Caves were, otherwise, left in its ruinous condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Preeti Chopra|title=A Joint Enterprise: Indian Elites and the Making of British Bombay|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jhTiCnh6RqAC&amp;pg=PA200 |year=2011|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-7036-9|pages=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1970s, the Government of India restored the main cave in its attempt to make it a tourist and heritage site. The caves were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 as per the cultural criteria of UNESCO: the caves "represent a masterpiece of human creative genius" and "bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilisation which is living or which has disappeared".&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Elephanta Caves Mumbai layout map.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Overview of Elephanta Caves site.]]
The island has two groups of caves in the rock-cut architectural style. The caves are hewn from solid basalt rock. The larger group of caves, which consists of five caves on the western hill of the island, is well known for its Hindu sculptures. The primary cave, numbered as Cave 1, is about {{convert|1.0|km|abbr=on}} up a hillside, facing the Mumbai harbour. Caves 2 through 5 are next to Cave 1 further southeast, arranged in a row. Cave 6 and 7 are about {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} northeast of Cave 1 and 2, but geologically on the edge of the eastern hill.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

The two hills are connected by a walkway. The eastern hill is also called the Stupa hill, while the western hill is called the Canon hill, reflecting their historic colonial era names, the ancient Stupa and the Portuguese era firing Canons they host respectively.&lt;ref name = "historic_places"/&gt;

All Caves are a rock-cut temples that cover an area of {{convert|5600|m2|abbr=on}}, and they include a main chamber, two lateral chambers, courtyards, and subsidiary shrines. Cave 1 is the largest and is {{convert|39|m|ft}} deep from the front entrance to the back. The temple complex is primarily the abode of [[Shiva]], depicted in widely celebrated carvings which narrate legends and mythologies of [[Shaivism]].&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;&lt;ref name=state/&gt; However, the artwork reverentially displays themes from [[Shaktism]] and [[Vaishnavism]] traditions of Hinduism as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carmel Berkson|author2=Wendy Doniger|author3=George Michell|title=Elephanta: The Cave of Shiva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RYqq7um0hcC|year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press (Motilal Banarsidass, Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-1284-0|pages=10–13, 46, 64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins1988x"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Dillard Collins|title=The Iconography and Ritual of Siva at Elephanta: On Life, Illumination, and Being|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pQNi6kAGJQ4C&amp;pg=PR9|year=1988|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-773-0|pages=x item 31, 98–99}}, Quote: "31.

To reach the main cave, a visitor or pilgrim has to walk up 120 steep steps from the shore beach, or take the tourist toy train. At the main entrance are four pillars, with three open porticoes and an aisle at the back. Pillars, six in each row, divide the hall into a series of smaller chambers. The roof of the hall has concealed beams supported by stone columns joined together by capitals.&lt;ref name=state/&gt;&lt;ref name = "historic_places"/&gt;

The temple is enclosed in the cave, it has interior walls but no exterior wall. The pillars create the space and symmetric rhythm as they support the weight of hill above. The main mandapa recesses into a pillared vestibule (''ardha-mandapa'') on the south side, while a pillared portico (''mukha-mandapa'') connects it to the main entrance. Embedded within the Great Cave are dedicated shrines, the largest of which is the square plan Linga shrine (see 16 in plan).&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1988p443"/&gt; It is a square ''garbha-griya'' (womb house) with four entrances, located in the right section of the main hall. Steps lead from the four doorways into the sanctum, which has a linga in the ''mulavigraha'' style. Each doorway is guarded by a ''dvarapala'' on each side, for a total of eight dvarapalas, their heights spanning floor to the ceiling.&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1988p444"/&gt; These were badly damaged when the Portuguese ceded control of this region to the British. The linga shrine is surrounded by a mandapa and circumambulation path (''pradakshina-patha'') as in other [[Hindu temple]]s. The pillars are similarly aligned east-west to this shrine, and have an east entrance. Overlaid, as if fused, on the architecture of this temple is another open temple aligned to the north-south direction with three faced Sadashiva as its focal center. One features the abstract, unmanifest, aniconic symbol of Shiva, the other anthropomorphic, manifest, iconic symbol of Shiva. The mandapa pillars of the two align up.&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1988p444"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Presence of Siva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjqfkgD6YCAC&amp;pg=PA444 |year=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass  |isbn=978-81-208-0491-3|pages=444–445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern entrance to the cave is flanked by two panels of Shiva dated to the [[Gupta period]], both damaged. The left panel depicts [[Yogishvara]] (Shiva as the Lord of [[Yoga]]) and the right shows [[Nataraja]] (Shiva as the Lord of Dance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carmel Berkson|author2=Wendy Doniger|author3=George Michell|title=Elephanta: The Cave of Shiva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RYqq7um0hcC|year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press (Motilal Banarsidass, Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-1284-0|pages=32–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sadashiva is flanked by two large friezes, one of Ardhanarishvara and the other of Gangadhara.&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1988p450"/&gt; The walls of the mandapa feature other Shaivism legends. All the friezes, states [[Stella Kramrisch]], feature the ''{{Proper name|vyaktavyakta}}'' concept of [[Samkhya]], where the state of spiritual existence transitions between the unmanifest-manifest, the figures leap out of the cave walls towards the spectator as if trying to greet the narrative. Even the manifested Sadashiva is shown to be rising out of the rocks.&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1988p450"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Presence of Siva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjqfkgD6YCAC&amp;pg=PA450 |year=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass  |isbn=978-81-208-0491-3|pages=450–451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each wall has large carvings of Shiva-related legends, each more than {{convert|5|m|ft}} in height. The central Shiva relief ''Trimurti'' is located on the south wall opposite the main entrance. Also called the Sadashiva, it is the iconic form of a ''pancamukha linga'' is set in a mandala pattern with the abstract linga form of Shiva.&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1988p445"/&gt; The Sadashiva is a colossal carving, a bit over {{convert|6.27|m}}, depicting Tatpurusha (Mahadeva), Aghora (Bhairava), Vamadeva (Uma) and Sadyojata (Nandin).&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1988p445"/&gt; The carving is unusual because the standard ancient Hindu texts for [[murti]] design state that the Tatpursha should face east, but in Elephanta it is the north face (pointing towards the main entrance).&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1988p445"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Presence of Siva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjqfkgD6YCAC&amp;pg=PA445 |year=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass  |isbn=978-81-208-0491-3|pages=445–447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller shrines are located at the east and west ends of the caves. The eastern sanctuary serves as a ceremonial entrance, and its shrine shows iconography of [[Shaktism]] tradition.&lt;ref name=state/&gt;&lt;ref name = "historic_places"/&gt;

====Sadasiva: Trimurti====
[[File:Trimurti, Cave No. 1, Elephanta Caves - 1.jpg|thumb|[[Trimurti]] Shiva flanked by the ''dvarapalas''.]]

The Trimurti is considered a masterpiece and the most important sculpture in the caves.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p148"/&gt; It is carved in relief on the south wall of the cave facing the north entrance, along the north-south axis. It is also known as ''Sadashiva'' and ''Maheshmurti''. The image, {{convert|6|m|abbr=on}} in height, depicts a three-headed Shiva, representing [[Sadasiva|Panchamukha Shiva]].&lt;ref name = "info"&gt;[[:File:Elephanta info.jpg]]: Maharashtra Tourism plaque at the caves&lt;/ref&gt;

The three heads represent three essential aspects of Shiva: creation, protection, and destruction.&lt;ref name=berksonxiv/&gt; As per another version, the three heads symbolize compassion and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval India the study of a civilization|first=Irfan|last=Habib|page=49|publisher=National Book Trust, India|location=|isbn=978-81-237-5255-6|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right half-face (west face) shows him holding a lotus bud, depicting the promise of life and creativity. This face is symbolism for [[Brahma]], the creator or [[Parvati|Uma]] or [[Vamadeva]], the feminine side of Shiva and creator.&lt;ref name=berksonxiv/&gt; The left half-face (east face) is that of a moustached young man. This is Shiva as the terrifying Aghora or Bhairava, the chaos creator and destroyer.&lt;ref name=berksonxiv/&gt; This is also known as Rudra-Shiva, the Destroyer. The central face, benign and meditative Tatpurusha, resembles the preserver [[Vishnu]]. This is the Shiva form as the "master of positive and negative principles of existence and preserver of their harmony".&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;&lt;ref name=state/&gt; The three headed Shiva are his creator, preserver and destroyer aspects in Shaivism. They are equivalently symbolism for Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma, they being equivalent of the three aspects found in Shaivism.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p148"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones|author2=James D. Ryan|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC&amp;pg=PA148 |year=2006|publisher=Infobase|isbn=978-0-8160-7564-5|pages=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=berksonxiv&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carmel Berkson|author2=Wendy Doniger|author3=George Michell|title=Elephanta: The Cave of Shiva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RYqq7um0hcC|year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press (Motilal Banarsidass, Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-1284-0|pages=xiv-xvi, 12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gangadhara====
[[File:Elephanta Gangadhara.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Shiva bringing Ganges River to earth.]]
The Trimurti Shiva is flanked on its left by ''[[Ardhanarisvara]]'' (a half-Shiva, half-Parvati composite) and ''[[Gangadhara]]'' legend to its right. The ''Gangadhara'' image to the right of the ''Trimurti'' show Shiva and Parvati standing. Shiva brings the River Ganges down from the heavens to serve man, and her immense power is contained effortlessly in Shiva's hair as she descends from heaven. The artists carved a small three bodied goddess up high, a symbolism for Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati. The mother goddess Parvati stands tall next to Shiva, smiling. The carving is {{convert|4|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|5.207|m|abbr=on}} high.&lt;ref name=berksonxvi&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carmel Berkson|author2=Wendy Doniger|author3=George Michell|title=Elephanta: The Cave of Shiva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RYqq7um0hcC|year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press (Motilal Banarsidass, Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-1284-0|pages=xvi-xvii, 13–14, 24, 46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gangadhara image is highly damaged, particularly the lower half of Shiva seen seated with Parvati, who is shown with four arms, two of which are broken. From the crown, a cup with a triple-headed female figure (with broken arms) to depict the three major rivers in Hindu texts. An alternate interpretation of the three bodied goddess in Gangadharamurti panel here and elsewhere is that it represents the regenerative powers of rivers in the form of Mandakini, Suradhani and Bhagavati.&lt;ref name=berksonxvi/&gt; In this grotto scene, Shiva is sculpted and bedecked with ornaments, while gods gather to watch the cosmic source of earthly abundance. The gods and goddesses shown are identifiable from the ''vahana'' (vehicle) and icons, and they include [[Brahma]] (left), [[Indra]] (left), [[Vishnu]] (right), [[Saraswati]], [[Indrani]], [[Lakshmi]], and others.&lt;ref name=berksonxvi/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1988p453"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Presence of Siva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjqfkgD6YCAC&amp;pg=PA452 |year=1988|publisher=Princeton University Press (Reprint: Motilal Banarsidass)|isbn=978-81-208-0491-3|pages=452–454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wrapped on one of the arms of Shiva is his iconic coiling serpent whose hood is seen near his left shoulder. Another hand (partly broken) gives the semblance of Shiva hugging Parvati, with a head of matted hair. A damaged ornamented drapery covers his lower torso, below the waist. Parvati is carved to the left of Shiva with a coiffured hair dress, fully bedecked with ornaments and jewellery.&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1988p453"/&gt; Between them stands a ''gana'' (dwarf jester) expressing confused panic as to whether Shiva will be able to contain the mighty river goddess. In the lower left of the panel is a kneeling devout figure in ''[[namaste]]'' posture representing the heroic mythical king Bhagiratha who worked hard to bring the river of prosperity to his earthly kingdom, but unaware of the potentially destructive forces that came with it.&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1988p453"/&gt;

====Ardhanarishvara====
[[File:Ardhanari@ Elephanta Caves.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ardhanarishvara]] (centre): half female (Parvati) and half male (Shiva), feminine-masculine equivalence.]]
On the wall to the east of the ''Trimurti'' is a damaged four-armed ''Ardhanarishvara'' carving. This image, which is {{convert|5.11|m|abbr=on}} in height. It represents the ancient Hindu concept of essential interdependence of the feminine and the masculine aspects in the universe, for its creation, its sustenance and its destruction.&lt;ref name="Kinsley1988p49"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kinsley|title=Hindu Goddesses: Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HzldwMHeS6IC|year=1988|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-90883-3|pages=49–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins1988p76"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Dillard Collins|title=The Iconography and Ritual of Siva at Elephanta: On Life, Illumination, and Being|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQNi6kAGJQ4C |year=1988|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-773-0|pages=76–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is represented as half woman shown as half of Parvati in this Elephanta panel on the right side, with breast, waist, feminine hair and items such as a mirror in the upper hand. The second half man side is Shiva with male characteristics and items iconographically his symbol. In Shaivism, the concept pictorially symbolizes the transcendence of all duality including gender, with the spiritual lacking any distinctions, where energy and power (Shakti, Parvati) is unified and is inseparable with the soul and awareness (Brahman, Shiva).&lt;ref name="Kinsley1988p49"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kl0DYIjUPgC|year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3179-8|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jackie Menzies|title=Goddess: divine energy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pzLqAAAAMAAJ|year=2006|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|isbn=978-0734763969|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the panel, the relief shows a headdress (double-folded) with two pleats draped towards the female head (Parvati) and the right side (Shiva) depicting curled hair and a crescent. The female figure has all the ornamentation (broad armlets and long  bracelets, a large ring in the ear, jewelled rings on the fingers) but the right male figure has drooping hair, armlets and wristlets. One of his hands rests on [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] bull’s left horn, Shiva's mount, which is fairly well preserved.&lt;ref name=stella451/&gt;&lt;ref name=berkson7xvii&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carmel Berkson|author2=Wendy Doniger|author3=George Michell|title=Elephanta: The Cave of Shiva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RYqq7um0hcC|year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press (Motilal Banarsidass, Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-1284-0|pages=7–14, 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair of hands at the back is also bejewelled; the right hand of the male side holds a serpent, while the left hand of the female side holds a mirror. The front left hand is broken, while a large part of the lower half of the panel was damaged at some point. Around the Ardhanarishwara are three layers of symbolic characters. The lowest or at the same level as the viewer are human figures oriented reverentially towards the androgyne image. Above them are gods and goddesses such as Brahma, Vishnu, Indra and others who are seated on their ''vahanas''. Above them are flying ''apsaras'' approaching the fused divinity with garlands, music and celebratory offerings.&lt;ref name=stella451&gt;{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Presence of Siva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjqfkgD6YCAC&amp;pg=PA451 |year=1988|publisher=Princeton University Press (Reprint: Motilal Banarsidass)|isbn=978-81-208-0491-3|pages=451–452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shiva slaying Andhaka====
[[File:Shiva slaying Andhaka.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Shiva slaying Andhaka]]
The panel in the northwest side of the cave, on the wall near west entrance and the Linga shrine (see 7 in plan), is an uncommon sculpture about the ''Andhakasura-vadha'' legend.&lt;ref name="Collins1988p1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Dillard Collins|title=The Iconography and Ritual of Siva at Elephanta: On Life, Illumination, and Being|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQNi6kAGJQ4C |year=1988|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-773-0|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows [[Bhairava]], or [[Virabhadra]], a ferocious form of Shiva killing the demon ''Andhaka'' (literally, "blind, darkness"). The relief is much ruined below the waist, is {{convert|3.5|m|abbr=on}} high and posed in action. Though a relief, it is carved to give it a three dimensional form, as if the ferocious Shiva is coming out of the rocks and impaling Andhaka with his trident.&lt;ref name=berkson1135&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carmel Berkson|author2=Wendy Doniger|author3=George Michell|title=Elephanta: The Cave of Shiva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RYqq7um0hcC|year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press (Motilal Banarsidass, Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-1284-0|pages=8–15, 35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stella460&gt;{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Presence of Siva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjqfkgD6YCAC&amp;pg=PA455 |year=1988|publisher=Princeton University Press (Reprint: Motilal Banarsidass)|isbn=978-81-208-0491-3|pages=455–458, 460–461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhairava's headgear has a ruff on the back, a skull and cobra over the forehead, and the crescent high on the right. His facial expression is of anger, conviction of something he must do, and one in the middle of action. The legs and five of the eight arms are broken, attributed to Portuguese vandalism. The smaller broken image Andhaka is seen below Bhairava's image.&lt;ref name=geo/&gt; Also depicted in his right hand is the symbolic weapon that Shaiva mythology states Shiva used to kill the destructive elephant demon.&lt;ref name=stella460/&gt; A hand holds a bowl to collect the blood dripping from the slain Andhaka, which Shaiva legend states was necessary because the dripping blood had the power to become new demons if they got nourished by the ground.&lt;ref name=stella460/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Dillard Collins|title=The Iconography and Ritual of Siva at Elephanta: On Life, Illumination, and Being|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQNi6kAGJQ4C |year=1988|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-773-0|pages=57–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the artwork shows ruined parts of a male and two female forms, figures of two ascetics, a small figure in front, a female figure, and two dwarfs.&lt;ref name=geo/&gt; The uppermost part shows flying apsaras bringing garlands.&lt;ref name=stella460/&gt;

[[File:Elephanta Marriage.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Kalyanasundara]]: the wedding of Shiva and Parvati.]]

====Wedding of Shiva====
The niche image carved on the southwest wall, near the Linga shrine (see 6 on plan) is the wedding of Shiva and Parvati. This legend is called the [[Kalyanasundara]] in Hindu texts.&lt;ref name="Collins1988p1"/&gt; Parvati is seen standing to Shiva's right, the customary place for a Hindu bride at the wedding. The carvings are substantially damaged, but the ruined remains of the sculpture has been significant to scholarly studies of Hindu literature. In many surviving versions of the [[Puranas]], the wedding takes place in King Parvata's palace. However, in this Elephanta Cave panel, the narrative shows some earlier version.&lt;ref name=stella454wed/&gt; Here King Parvata standing behind Parvati gives away the bride to Shiva while [[Brahma]] is the priest in the grotto relief.&lt;ref name=stella454wed/&gt; Gods, goddesses and celestial apsaras are cheering witness to the wedding. Vishnu is witness to the marriage, standing tall behind the sitting Brahma on the right side of the panel. Just above the main images [[rishi]] (sages) and a few characters hanging from the ceiling are seen blessing the wedding.&lt;ref name=geo/&gt;

The groom Shiva is shown calm and young, while Parvati is depicted as shy and emotional. Her head is tilted towards him and her eyelids joyfully lowered, while his hand (now broken) is holding hers.&lt;ref name=stella454wed&gt;{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Presence of Siva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjqfkgD6YCAC&amp;pg=PA454 |year=1988|publisher=Princeton University Press (Reprint: Motilal Banarsidass)|isbn=978-81-208-0491-3|pages=454–455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their dress reflect the Hindu customs. He wears the sacred thread across his chest, she the customary jewelry. The other characters shown in the wedding carry items or are shown holding items that typically grace a Hindu wedding. Chandra (moon god), for example, holds a traditionally decorated water vessel (''kalash''). Brahma, the priest, is squatting on the floor to the right tending the ''[[yajna]]'' fire (agni mandapa).&lt;ref name=stella454wed/&gt;

====Yogishvara: Lord of Yoga====
[[File:Yogishvara Lord of Yoga Shiva at Elephanta Cave 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Shiva as ''Yogishvara'', god of Yoga.]]

The panel in the east side of the portico next to the north entrance (see 9 on plan) is Shiva in Yoga. This form of Shiva is called Yogishvara, Mahayogi, [[Lakulisa]].&lt;ref name="asi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_elephanta.asp|title=World Heritage Sites – Elephanta Caves|work=Official site of ASI|publisher=Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Government of India|accessdate=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins1988p1"/&gt;

Shiva, states Stella Kramrisch, is the "primordial [[yogi]]" in this panel. He is the master of discipline, the teacher of Yoga arts, the master who shows how yoga and meditation leads to the realization of ultimate reality.&lt;ref name=stella454yogi&gt;{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Presence of Siva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjqfkgD6YCAC |year=1988|publisher=Princeton University Press (Reprint: Motilal Banarsidass)|isbn=978-81-208-0491-3|pages=458–459 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Madhukar Keshav Dhavalikar|title= Elephanta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LIIMAQAAMAAJ|year= 2007|publisher=Archaeological Survey of India|isbn=978-81-904866-0-6|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=michell34&gt;{{cite book|author=George Michell|title=Elephanta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2iExAQAAIAAJ|year=2015|publisher=Jaico|isbn= 978-8-184-95603-0 |pages=34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relief is in a dilapidated condition with most of the arms and legs broken.&lt;ref name=geo/&gt; He is seated in [[Lotus position|padmasana]] lost in his meditation. His posture is well formed and suggests that the 6th century artist knew this [[asana]]. He sits on a lotus with a stalk shown as if coming out of the earth, his legs are crossed symmetrically. Two Nagas flank the lotus and express their reverence with a namaste posture. The great yogi is being approached by various Vedic and Puranic gods and goddesses, as well as monks and sadhus, yet there is a halo around him that keeps them at bay, as if they admire it but do not wish to disturb his meditation.&lt;ref name=stella454yogi/&gt;&lt;ref name=michell34/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carmel Berkson|author2=Wendy Doniger|author3=George Michell|title=Elephanta: The Cave of Shiva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RYqq7um0hcC|year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press (Motilal Banarsidass, Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-1284-0|pages=36–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some ways, the yogi artwork shown in this Hindu cave are similar to those found in Buddhist caves, but there are differences. Yogi Shiva, or Lakulisa, wears a crown here, his chest is shown vaulting forward as if in breathing exercises found in Hindu yoga texts, the face and body expresses a different energy. This Shiva yogi comes across as the "lord of the caves" or ''Guhesvara'' in medieval Indian poetry, states Kramrisch.&lt;ref name=stella454yogi/&gt; According to Charles Collins, the depiction of Shiva as Yogi in Elephanta Cave 1 is harmonious with those found in the Puranas dated to early and mid 1st millennium CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Dillard Collins|title=The Iconography and Ritual of Siva at Elephanta: On Life, Illumination, and Being|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQNi6kAGJQ4C |year=1988|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-773-0|pages=36–47, 52–58, 64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nataraja: Lord of Dance====
[[File:Shiva Nataraja, grotte d'Elephanta (Mumbai, Inde), Cave 1.jpg|thumb|Shiva as Nataraja, god of dance.]]
The panel facing the Yogishvara, on the west side of the portico next to the north entrance (see 8 on plan) is Shiva as the [[Nataraja]], "cosmic dancer" and "the lord of dancers".&lt;ref name="asi"/&gt; It is also called the ''Nrittamurti''.&lt;ref name="Collins1988p1"/&gt;

The badly damaged relief panel is {{convert|4|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|3.4|m|abbr=on}} high and set low on the wall. His body and arms are shown as wildly gyrating in the ''lalita'' mudra, a symbolism for occupying all of space, soaring energy and full bodied weightlessness.

In another he holds a folded cloth, possibly symbolic veil of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]''.&lt;ref name=stella459dance/&gt;

There are fewer gods, goddesses and observers in this panel than others in this cave, with Brahma, Vishnu, Lakshmi, Saraswati and Parvati are visible and have a facial expression of being spellbound. Also present are his sons leaping [[Ganesha]] and [[Kartikeya]] holding Shiva's staff, as well as an ascetic and a [[rishi]], thus weaving the family life and the ascetic monastic life, the secular and the spiritual tied in through metaphorical symbolism of dance within the same panel.&lt;ref name=stella459dance&gt;{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Presence of Siva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjqfkgD6YCAC |year=1988|publisher=Princeton University Press (Reprint: Motilal Banarsidass)|isbn=978-81-208-0491-3|pages=459–460}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carmel Berkson|author2=Wendy Doniger|author3=George Michell|title=Elephanta: The Cave of Shiva|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_RYqq7um0hcC| year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press (Motilal Banarsidass, Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-1284-0|pages=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dancer and destroyer aspects of Shiva are clustered in the northwest part of the cave, in contrast to yoga and creator aspects that are found in the northeast parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carmel Berkson|author2=Wendy Doniger|author3=George Michell|title=Elephanta: The Cave of Shiva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RYqq7um0hcC|year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press (Motilal Banarsidass, Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-1284-0|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 6th-century Nataraja shares architectural elements with those found in temples in the western parts of South Asia such as in Gujarat, and in upper Deccan region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Dillard Collins|title=The Iconography and Ritual of Siva at Elephanta: On Life, Illumination, and Being|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQNi6kAGJQ4C |year=1988|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-773-0|pages=102–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mount Kailash and Ravananugraha====
{{double image|right|Elephanta caves pic.jpg|150|Elephanta Ravana.JPG|150|Left: Shiva and Parvati on Mount Kailasha. Right: Ravana shaking Mount Kailash.}}
The carvings at the east entrance are battered and blurry. One in the southeast corner of the mandapa (see 2 on plan) depicts Shiva and Parvati in [[Mount Kailash]] in the Himalayas, and the shows the ''Umamaheshvara'' story.&lt;ref name="Collins1988p1"/&gt; The scene includes rocky terrain and clouds layered horizontally.

The panel facing the Mount Kailash panel towards the northeast corner (see 1 on plan) depicts demon king [[Ravananugraha|Ravana trying to lift Kailash]] and bother Shiva, a legend called ''Ravananugraha''.&lt;ref name="Collins1988p1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sharma327&gt;BN Sharma (1973), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/29755892 Rāvaṇa Lifting Mount Kailāsa in Indian Art], East and West, Vol. 23, No. 3/4 (September–December 1973), pages 327-338&lt;/ref&gt; The upper scene is Mount Kailash, where Shiva and Parvati are seated. Shiva is recognizable with a crown, and other characters are badly damaged. A portion of ascetic skeletal devotee Bhringi relief survives and he is seated near Shiva's feet. Near Shiva an outline of what may have been Ganesha and Kartikeya are visible. Below the mountain surface is shown the demon-king [[Ravana]] is seen with a few arms, trying to unsuccessfully shake Shiva and Parvati in Mount Kailash. The rest of the details are blurry and speculative.&lt;ref name=stella458/&gt;&lt;ref name=sharma327/&gt; According to Charles Collins, the discernible elements of this panel are generally consistent with those in medieval era Puranas, though there is a lack in literal correspondence with any single text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Dillard Collins|title=The Iconography and Ritual of Siva at Elephanta: On Life, Illumination, and Being|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQNi6kAGJQ4C |year=1988|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-773-0|pages=41–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Linga shrine====
{{double image|right|La grotte de Shiva à Elephanta (Mumbai, Inde), Cave 1.jpg|200|Shiva Linga shrine in Elephanta Caves.jpg|200|Shiva Linga shrine inside the cave complex.}}

The central shrine of the Great Cave temple is a free-standing square stone cella, with entrances on each of its sides.&lt;ref name=stellacella&gt;{{cite book|author= Stella Kramrisch|title=The Presence of Siva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjqfkgD6YCAC |year= 1988|publisher= Princeton University Press (Reprint: Motilal Banarsidass)| isbn=978-81-208-0491-3| pages=445–446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each door is flanked by two ''dvarapalas'' (gate guardians), for a total of eight around the shrine.&lt;ref name=stellacella/&gt; The height of the eight ''dvarapalas'' is about {{convert|4.6|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="historic places"/&gt; All are in a damaged condition except those at the southern door to the shrine. The Shaiva guardians carry weapons and flank the doors.&lt;ref name=stellacella/&gt;

Six steps lead to the inside of the cella from the floor level. In the center is the ''mulavigraha'' [[Linga]],  is set on a raised platform above the floor of the shrine by {{convert|1.8|m|abbr=on}}. It is the abstract unmanifest symbol of Shiva in union with the [[Yoni]], and the symbol of Parvati together symbolising the creative source and the regenerative nature of existence.&lt;ref name=stellacella/&gt; The temple and all the pillars are laid out to lead the pilgrim's view towards it, the cella is visible from any point inside the cave and its most significant progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carmel Berkson|author2=Wendy Doniger|author3=George Michell|title=Elephanta: The Cave of Shiva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RYqq7um0hcC|year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press (Motilal Banarsidass, Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-1284-0|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====East wing: Shaktism====
[[File:Grottes d'Elephanta - Sanctuaire de la grotte principale.jpg|thumb|The smaller east shrine.]]
On the east side of the main hall is a separate shrine. It is a {{convert|17|m|abbr=on}}-wide courtyard with a circular pedestal. It once had a seated Nandi facing the Linga shrine, but its ruins have not been restored. To the south side of this eastern courtyard is the Shaktism shrine, with a lion, each seated with a raised forepaw as guardian. Inside the west face of this small shrine (see 10-12 of plan) are ''Sapta Matrikas'', or the "seven mothers" along with Parvati, Kartikeya (Skanda) and Ganesha.&lt;ref name="Collins1988p1"/&gt; The smaller shrine's sanctum features a linga and has a circumambulatory path around it. The sanctum door has Shaiva ''dvarapalas''.&lt;ref name="Collins1988p1"/&gt;

The Shakti panel in the east shrine is unusual in that counting Parvati, it features eight mothers (''Asta matrikas'') in an era when ''Sapta matrikas'' were more common such as at Samalaji and Jogeswari caves.&lt;ref name="Schastok1985p85"/&gt; Additionally, the mothers are flanked on one side with Ganesha and the other with Skanda (Kartikeya) when typical artwork from mid 1st millennium show the Shakta mothers with Ganesha and Shiva.&lt;ref name="Schastok1985p85"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Meister | first=Michael W. | title=Regional Variations in Matrka Conventions | journal=Artibus Asiae | volume=47 | issue=3/4 | year=1986 | issn=0004-3648 | doi=10.2307/3249973 | pages=233–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sara L. Schastok, the Skanda in the east shrine of Elephanta Cave 1 is significant, just like the one found in Deogarh Hindu temple site, because he is depicted with regalia, weapons and icons similar to Shiva and because he is surrounded by gods and goddeses. By portraying Skanda with Matrikas, he is equated with the Krittikas legend and thereby Kartikeya, and by showing him so prominently centered the artists are likely communicating the unity of Skanda-Shiva, that all these divinities are in essence the same spiritual concept, "all emanations of the ''lingam'' at the very heart of Elephanta", according to Schastok.&lt;ref name="Schastok1985p85"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sara L.

====West wing: Other traditions====
On the west side of the main hall is another attached shrine, though in much more ruined state. The larger cave on the south side of the west shrine is closed, contains ruins and is bigger than the eastern side shrine. Some of the artworks from here were moved to museums and private collections by mid 19th century, including those related Brahma, Vishnu and others. The western face has two panels, one showing another version of Shiva in Yoga (see 14 on plan) and another Nataraja (see 15 on plan). Between these is a sanctum with a Shiva Linga.&lt;ref name="Collins1988p1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Dillard Collins|title=The Iconography and Ritual of Siva at Elephanta: On Life, Illumination, and Being|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQNi6kAGJQ4C |year=1988|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-773-0|pages=102–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Yogi Shiva panel is damaged, but unlike the other Yogi depiction, here the leg position in Yoga asana have survived.  The Yogishvara is seated on a lotus, and near him are two badly defaced characters, possibly one of parvati and another ascetic. Above him are ruin remains of celestial gods or goddesses or apasaras. The Yogi Shiva is wearing a crown, and once again there is a space of isolation around the meditating yogi in which no other character enters. Below him, under the lotus, are Nagas and several badly damaged figures two of whom are in ''namaste'' reverence posture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Dillard Collins|title=The Iconography and Ritual of Siva at Elephanta: On Life, Illumination, and Being|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQNi6kAGJQ4C |year=1988|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-773-0|pages=141–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nataraja shown in the west shrine is similar in style to one inside the main mandapa. However, states Collins, its depth of carving appears inferior and it seems more eroded being more open to rains and water damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Dillard Collins|title=The Iconography and Ritual of Siva at Elephanta: On Life, Illumination, and Being|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQNi6kAGJQ4C |year=1988|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-773-0|pages=102–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caves 2-5: Canon hill===
{{double image|right|Elephanta caves3.jpg|200|Elephanta Caves in Elephanta Island in Maharashtra.JPG|200|[[:Commons:Category:Elephanta Cave 3|Cave 3]] (left) and [[:Commons:Category:Elephanta Cave 4|Cave 4]] (right). The caves are smaller, the works of art inside mostly damaged. [https://goo.gl/maps/56ZdDyM2uKm 3D Tour].}}
To the south-east of the Great Cave is [[:Commons:Category:Elephanta Cave 2|Cave 2]]. The cave is unfinished. The front of this cave was completely destroyed and restored in the 1970s with four square pillars. It has two small cells in the back.&lt;ref name=DHAV/&gt;

[[:Commons:Category:Elephanta Cave 3|Cave 3]] is next to Cave 2, as one continues to go away from the main shrine. It is a portico with six pillars, and a mandapa with pillars.The portico is {{convert|26|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|11|m|abbr=on}} deep and is supported by four reconstructed pillars.&lt;ref name=DHAV/&gt; At the back of the portico are three chambers. The central door at the back of the portico leads to a damaged shrine, the sanctum seems to be for a Linga, but that is lost. The shrine is a plain room {{convert|6|m|abbr=on}} deep by {{convert|5.7|m|abbr=on}} wide with a low altar. The shrine door has some traces of sculpture. The ''dvarapalas'' on each side, leaning on dwarfs with flying figures over the head, are now in fragments.&lt;ref name=Dhavalikar73/&gt; There are two other chambers, one on each side of the shrine.&lt;ref name=DHAV&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dhavalikar |first1=M.

[[:Commons:Category:Elephanta Cave 4|Cave 4]] is quite damaged, the large verandah lacking all its columns. The relief remains suggest the cave was once a Shaiva temple as well. The shrine in the back contains a lingam. There are also three cells for monks, and a chapel at each end of the verandah.&lt;ref name=DHAV/&gt;

===Caves 6-7: Stupa hill===
{{triple image|right|Elephanta Cave No 6.jpg|195|Elephanta Cave 6 Plan.jpg|200|Elephanta Cave 6 Shrine door detail.jpg|123|Cave 6, plan of the cave, and shrine door of the cave.}}
Across the ravine from Cave 1 on the hill on the other side are two Buddhist caves, together with the remains of a [[stupa]] and water tanks.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Sacred Places"/&gt; It seems the Buddhists were the first occupants of the island.&lt;ref&gt;"Long before the Brahmans selected Elephanta for their temple to the Great God, the Hinayana Buddhists came to the island for more or less the same purpose, to raise a monument to the Buddha." {{cite book |last1=Kail |first1=Owen C. |title=Elephanta, the island of mystery |date=1984 |publisher=Taraporevala |page=19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ylweAAAAMAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elephanta: The Cave of Shiva"/&gt;

One is a large hall known as [[:Commons:Category:Elephanta Cave 6|Cave 6]], or Sitabai's temple cave ({{coord|18.963835|72.934125|display=inline}}). The portico has four pillars and two pilasters. The hall has 3 chambers at the back, the central one a shrine and the rest for monks or priests. The hall is devoid of any decoration, except for the door of the central shrine, which has pilasters and a frieze, with the threshold decorated with lion figures.&lt;ref&gt;For pictures of Cave 6, see [https://kevinstandagephotography.wordpress.com/2018/04/29/elephanta-caves-elephanta-island-mumbai/ this site]&lt;/ref&gt; The sanctum has no remaining image. Cave 6 is historically significant because it was converted and used as a Christian church by the Portuguese in the later years when the island was a part of their colony (at some point between 1534 and 1682).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Michell|title=Elephanta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2iExAQAAIAAJ|year=2015|publisher=Jaico|isbn= 978-8-184-95603-0 |pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Guide To Elephanta |date=1934 |page=10 |url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.279314/2015.279314.A-Guide#page/n21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, along the face of the eastern hill to the north of Sitabai's cave is Cave 7 ({{coord|18.965100|72.934766|display=inline}}), another small excavation with a [[veranda]], which was probably to be three cells, but was abandoned following the discovery of a flaw in the rock.

Past Cave 7, to the east is a dry pond, with large artificial boulders and several Buddhist cisterns along its banks. Near the cistern, now at the end of the north spur of the hill, is a mound that was identitied as the remains of a Buddhist [[stupa]] ({{coord|18.966026|72.936753}}). This stupa, state Michell and Dhavalikar, was originally much taller and dates to about the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Michell|title=Elephanta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2iExAQAAIAAJ|year=2015|publisher=Jaico|isbn= 978-8-184-95603-0 |pages=90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For pictures of the stupa remains see [https://kevinstandagephotography.wordpress.com/2018/05/09/in-search-of-the-elephanta-stupa/ this site]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lost monuments===
[[File:Brahma statue (6th century CE).jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|An Elephanta artwork now at the [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya]], [[Mumbai]].]]
Many artworks from the Elephanta Caves ruins are now held in major museums around the world. These include an almost completely destroyed Durga [[Mahishasuramardini]] statue with only the buffalo demon with Durga's legs and some waist surviving. Other scholarly studied museum held Elephanta sculpture include a part of Brahma head, several ruins of Vishnus from different statues, a range of panels and free standing stone carvings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmvs.in/currently-on-display/168-mahishasuramardini.html?highlight=WyJkdXJnYSJd Basalt: Elephanta Mahishasuramardini], Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, Maharashtra, Mid 6th Century AD&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= S.N.

Issue 1-5|year=1955|publisher=Lalit Kala Akademi|pages=87–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schastok, some of these are "surely not part of the Great Cave", but it is unclear where they were found when they were moved elsewhere, or when ruins were cleared and restoration process initiated.&lt;ref name=schastok51/&gt;

The significant statues of Vishnu are difficult to explain and to position inside other surviving caves. One theory states that some of the caves must have represented the [[Vaishnavism]] tradition. Another theory by some scholars such as Moti Chandra suggests that the island once had open air structural Hindu temples in addition to the caves, but these were the first victims of art destruction.&lt;ref name=schastok51&gt;{{cite book|author=Sara L. Schastok|title=The Śāmalājī Sculptures and 6th Century Art in Western India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jh1fF8HvJmMC |year=1985|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-06941-0|pages=43–44, 51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vishnu sculptures found among the Elephanta ruins express different styles. One wears a ''dhoti'' and has a looped girdle, while holding a conch at an angle near his thigh. The remnants of his sides suggest that this was likely a four arm iconography.&lt;ref name=schastok51/&gt; Another statue has elements of Shiva and Vishnu. It was identified to be Shiva by Pramod Chandra, as Kartikeya by Moti Chandra, and as Vishnu by others. It shows a chain link near the thigh, has a ''gada'' (mace) on side, and someone standing next to him of a damaged upper portion but with small waist and full breasts suggestive of a devi. This statue too is wearing a ''dhoti''.&lt;ref name=schastok51/&gt;

The island also had a stone horse according to 18th century records, just like the stone elephant that made colonial Portuguese call it "Ilha Elefante". However, this horse was removed to an unknown location before 1764.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

==Preservation==
[[File:Elephanta tourists.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tourists taking pictures of the Trimurti]]
The convenient location of these caves near Mumbai, the Western curiosity for the historic Indian culture, and the difficulty in reaching sites in infrastructure poor Indian subcontinent, made Elephanta Caves a subject of numerous guide books and significant scholarly interest in the 20th century. The early speculations and misconceptions about these caves led to many interpretations and scholarly disagreements but also increased the support for their preservation. The publication of their condition, sketches and interpretation by James Burgess in 1871 brought wider attention.&lt;ref name=collins25/&gt; The earliest efforts to preserve the Elephanta Caves were taken by British India officials in 1909, when the site was placed under the Indian Archaeological Department and the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act included it within its scope. This helped isolate the island and preserve the ruins.&lt;ref name=collins25&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Dillard Collins|title=The Iconography and Ritual of Siva at Elephanta: On Life, Illumination, and Being|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQNi6kAGJQ4C |year=1988|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-773-0|pages=1–2, 20–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More specific legislation to preserve the Elephanta Island monuments were enacted with the [[Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act]] of 1958 and Rules (1959); The Elephanta Island (Protected Monument) Rules of 1957, which prohibits mining, quarrying, blasting, excavation and other operations near the monument; the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act promulgated in 1972 with its Rules promulgated in 1973; a Notification issued in 1985 declaring the entire island and a {{convert|1|km|mi|adj=on}} area from the shore as "a prohibited area"; a series of Maharashtra State Government environmental acts protecting the site; the 1966 Regional and Town Planning Act; and the 1995 Heritage Regulations for Greater Bombay.&lt;ref name=state/&gt; However, it was in 1970s that the site received active conservation and restoration efforts. These efforts put back the ruins of Cave 1 and select parts of broken pillars in other caves, along with developing the island as a heritage site.&lt;ref name=britelephanta/&gt;&lt;ref name=geo/&gt;

The [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI), Aurangabad Circle maintains and manages the Elephanta Caves. It is responsible for monitoring and stabilisation of the rock face, construction of supports to the cave structures where pillars have collapsed, and consolidation of cave floors and construction of a parapet wall surrounding the site. In addition, it maintains the visitor facilities and an on-site museum. The site receives approximately 1,000 visitors a day, more on Shiva ratri, dance festivals, the World Heritage Day (18 April) and World Heritage Week between 19 and 25 November for special events.&lt;ref name=state/&gt;

After declaring the caves a World Heritage Site, UNESCO and the ASI have worked together to monitor the site and implement conservation methods on a routine basis.&lt;ref name=state/&gt; The [[Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage]] (INTACH) is also involved with the Archaeological Survey of India in improving the local conditions at the cave site.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The [[Constitution of Benin|Constitution]] provides for [[freedom of religion]], and the Government generally respected this right in practice. There were no reports of [[societal abuses]] or [[religious discrimination|discrimination]] based on religious belief or practice, and prominent societal leaders took positive steps to promote religious freedom.

==Religious demography==
{{main|Religion in Benin}}
According to the 2002 census, 27.1 percent of the population is [[Roman Catholic]], 24.4 percent [[Muslim]], 17.3 percent [[Vodun]], 5 percent [[Celestial Christian]], 3.2 percent [[Methodist]], 7.5 percent other Christian, 6 percent other traditional local religious groups, 1.9 percent other religious groups, and 6.5 percent claim no religious affiliation.

Foreign missionary groups operate freely in the country.

==Status of religious freedom==
===Legal and policy framework===
The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice. The Government at all levels sought to protect this right in full and did not tolerate its abuse, either by governmental or private actors. There is no state-sponsored religion.

The [[Constitutional Court]] determines the legal guidelines that govern religious practice. In recent years this court determined that it is illegal to block the access of any group to its religious services and that criticism of religious belief is a protected free speech right.

The [[Defense Ministry (Benin)|Defense Ministry]] is permitted to intervene in conflicts between religious groups as a [[peacekeeping force]] to ensure public order and social peace, provided that the intervention complies with the principle of state neutrality in the management of religious affairs.

Persons who wish to form a religious group must register with the [[Ministry of the Interior (Benin)|Ministry of the Interior]]. Registration requirements are the same for all religious groups, and there were no reports that any group was refused permission to register or subjected to unusual delays or obstacles in the registration process. Religious groups are free from taxation.

Government officials accorded respect to prominent leaders of all religious groups by attending their induction ceremonies, funerals, and other religious celebrations. The President regularly received leaders of all religious groups, and police forces were assigned to provide security to any religious event upon request.

In accordance with article 2 of the [[Constitution of Benin|Constitution]], which provides for a secular state, [[State school|public schools]] are not authorized to provide religious instruction. Religious groups are permitted to establish [[private schools]].

National holidays include the Christian holy days of [[Easter Monday]], [[Ascension Day]], [[Whit Monday]], [[Assumption Day]], [[All Saints' Day]], and [[Christmas]]; the Islamic holy days of [[Ramadan]], [[Tabaski]], and the [[Birth of the Prophet Muhammad]]; and the indigenous celebration of Traditional Religions holiday. State-operated television featured coverage of the celebration of religious holidays and special events in the lives of prominent religious leaders, including ordination anniversaries and funerals.

Soon after his inauguration, the President received leaders and representatives of Christian, Muslim, and traditional indigenous religious groups, respectively.

[[Ecumenical Day]] is celebrated every first Wednesday of May and traditionally includes a large celebration of interreligious cooperation in the historic town of [[Ouidah]]. Individual religious leaders make an effort to bridge the divide between Christians and Muslims and preach a message of tolerance.

===Restrictions on religious freedom===
Government policy and practice contributed to the generally free practice of religion. There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country. There were no reports of forced religious conversion.

==Societal abuses and discrimination==
There were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice. Due to the diversity of religious affiliations within families and communities, religious tolerance was widespread at all levels of society and in all regions. Interfaith dialogue occurred regularly, and citizens respected different religious traditions and practices, including syncretistic beliefs. Many Vodun followers were also Christian or Muslim and tolerant of other religious groups.

'''Freedom of religion in Mauritania''' is limited by the Government. The constitution establishes the country as an Islamic republic and decrees that [[Islam]] is the religion of its citizens and the State.

Non-Muslim resident expatriates and a few non-Muslim citizens practice their religion openly with certain limitations on [[proselytization]] and transmission of religious materials.

Relations between the Muslim community and the small non-Muslim community are generally amicable.

== Religious demography ==
Almost all of the population are practicing [[Sunni]] Muslims, although there are a few non-Muslims. [[Roman Catholic]] and non-denominational [[Christian]] churches have been established in Nouakchott, Atar, Zouerate, Nouadhibou, and Rosso. A number of expatriates practice [[Judaism]] but there are no synagogues.

There are several foreign faith-based nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) active in humanitarian and developmental work in the country.

== Status of religious freedom ==
Islam is generally considered to be the essential cohesive element unifying the country's various ethnic groups and castes. There is a cabinet-level Ministry of Culture and Islamic Orientation and a High Council of Islam, consisting of six [[imam]]s, which, at the Government's request, advises on the conformance of legislation to Islamic precepts.

[[Mosque]]s and [[Qur'an]]ic schools are funded privately by their members and other donors. One exception is a small stipend to the imam of the Central Mosque in the capital city of [[Nouakchott]] provided by the government.

The Government does not register religious groups; however, secular [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, inclusive of humanitarian and development NGO's affiliated with religious groups, must register with the Ministry of the Interior.

Nonprofit organizations, including both religious groups and secular NGO's, generally are not subject to taxation.

The judiciary consists of a single system of courts with a legal system that conforms with the principles of [[Shari'a]] (Islamic law).

The Government observes Muslim holidays as national holidays. A magistrate of Shari'a, who heads a separate government commission, decides the dates for observing religious holidays and addresses the nation on these holidays.

== Restrictions on religious freedom ==
There is no religious oath required of government employees or members of the ruling political party, except for the President and the members of the 5-person Constitutional Council and the 10-person High Council of Magistrates presided over by the President. The Constitutional Council and the High Council of Magistrates advise the President in matters of law and the Constitution. The oath of office includes a promise to [[God]] to uphold the law of the land in conformity with Islamic precepts.

In April 2018, the [[National Assembly (Mauritania)|National Assembly]] passed a law making the death penalty mandatory for "blasphemy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/05/04/mauritania-mandatory-death-penalty-blasphemy|title=Mauritania: Mandatory Death Penalty for Blasphemy|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proselytization to Muslims==
Although there is no specific legal prohibition against [[proselytizing]] by non-Muslims, in practice the Government prohibits proselytizing by non-Muslims through the use of Article 11 of the Press Act, which bans the publication of any material that is against Islam or contradicts or otherwise threatens Islam. The Government views any attempts by practitioners of other religions to convert Muslims as undermining society. Foreign faith-based NGO's limit their activities to humanitarian and development assistance. Even so, in June 2009 American aid worker Chris Leggett was murdered for allegedly proselytizing, according to the [[Barnabas Fund]].

===Possession and distribution of Bibles===
Under Article 11 of the Press Law, the Government may restrict the importation, printing, or public distribution of [[Bible]]s or other non-Islamic religious literature, and in practice Bibles are neither printed nor publicly sold in the country. However, the possession of Bibles and other non-Islamic religious materials in private homes is legal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71313.htm Mauritania&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shari'a]] provides the legal principles upon which the law and legal procedure are based. Mauritania follows the [[Maliki]] madhab, which has certain unique laws not applicable to other [[madhabs]].

'''Gonzalo Aemilius''' (born 1978 in [[Montevideo]]) is a Uruguayan [[Roman Catholic]] cleric.

==Biography==
Aemilius grew up in a middle-class family and attended a Catholic school in Montevideo. When he came of age he discovered his vocation for a religious career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/229702/conozca-a-gonzalo-aemilus-un-cura-del-siglo-xxi/|title=Meet Gonzalo Aemilius, a 21st-century priest|date=13 August 2012|publisher=[[El Observador (Uruguay)|El Observador]]}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being ordained priest, he was appointed principal of the [[Liceo Jubilar Juan Pablo II]] in 2005; his contribution was vital for the development of this Roman Catholic institution devoted to poor children. At the end of 2012 he was removed from the position and sent to the parish of Puntas del Manga to start a new work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liceojubilar.edu.uy/noticias/2012/nuestro-director-el-padre-gonzalo-aemilius-pasa-la-posta |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228103410/http://liceojubilar.edu.uy/noticias/2012/nuestro-director-el-padre-gonzalo-aemilius-pasa-la-posta |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 December 2012 |title=Our principal Aemilius |accessdate=2 June 2013 |publisher=Liceo Jubilar }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has a yearlong relationship to [[Pope Francis]], who was an important supporter of the Liceo Jubilar years ago when he was Archbishop of neighboring Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/246110/el-reencuentro-entre-aemilius-y-el-papa-jorge-soy-gonzalo-estoy-aca-/ |title=Aemilius reencounters Pope Francis|date=18 March 2013|publisher=[[El Observador (Uruguay)|El Observador]]}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book aims to narrate the life of [[Neminatha]], the twenty-second [[Tirthankara]] in [[Jainism]]. According to the Jain sources, [[Krishna]] is the first cousin of Tirthankara [[Neminatha]]. Therefore, Krishna’s adventures too occupy a significant portion of the book.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

The '''History of the [[Jews]] in [[Colombia]]''' begins in the Spanish colonial period with the arrival of the first Jews during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]].

== History ==

"New Christians", or [[Marranos]], fled the Iberian peninsula to escape persecution and seek religious freedom during the 16th and 17th centuries. It is estimated that some reached northern areas of Colombia, which at the time was known as [[New Kingdom of Granada|New Granada]]. Most if not all of these people assimilated into Colombian society. Some continue to practice traces of Sephardic Jewish rituals as family traditions.

In the 18th century, practicing [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] came from [[Jamaica]] and [[Curaçao]], where they had flourished under English and Dutch rule. These Jews started practicing their religion openly in Colombia at the end of the 18th century, although it was not officially legal to do so, given the established Catholic Church. After independence, Judaism was recognized as a legal religion. The government granted the Jews land for a cemetery.

Many Jews who came during the 18th and 19th centuries achieved prominent positions in Colombian society. Some married local women and felt they had to abandon or diminish their Jewish identity. These included author [[Jorge Isaacs]] of English Jewish ancestry, the industrialist [[James Martin Eder]] (who adopted the more Christian name of Santiago Eder when he translated his name to Spanish) born into the [[Latvian Jew]]ish community, as well as the De Lima, Salazar, Espinoza, Arias, Ramirez, Perez and Lobo families of [[Antillean]] [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Sephardim]]. Coincidentally, these persons and their families settled in the [[Valle del Cauca department|Cauca Valley]] region of Colombia. They have continued to be influential members of society in cities such as [[Cali]]. Over the generations most of their descendants converted or were raised as secular Catholics.

During the early part of the 20th century, numerous Sephardic Jewish immigrants came from Greece, Turkey, North Africa and [[Syria]]. Shortly after, Jewish immigrants began to arrive from Eastern Europe. A wave of [[Ashkenazi]] immigrants came after the rise of Nazism in 1933 and the imposition of anti-Semitic laws and practices, including more than 7,000 German Jews. From 1939 until the end of World War II, immigration was put to a halt by anti-immigrant feelings in the country and restrictions on immigration from Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio Klich &amp; Jeff Lesser, ''Arab and Jewish Immigrants in Latin America: Images and Realities,'' Psychology Press, 1997, pages 76-78&lt;/ref&gt; 

Colombia asked Germans who were on the U.S. blacklist to leave and allowed Jewish refugees in the country illegally to stay.&lt;ref name=LB&gt;Latin America during World War II by Thomas M. Leonard, John F. Bratzel, P.117&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish population increased dramatically in the 1950s and 1960s, and institutions such as synagogues, schools and social clubs were established throughout the largest cities in the country.

The changing economy and wave of kidnappings during the last decade of the 20th century led many members of Colombia's Jewish community to emigrate. Most settled in [[Miami]] and other parts of the United States. Successes in the nation's [[Democratic security|Democratic Security Policy]] has encouraged citizens to return; it has drastically reduced violence in the rural areas and criminality rates in urban areas, as well as in spurring the economy. The situation in Colombia has improved to the extent that many Venezuelan Jews are now seeking refuge in Colombia.

In the early 21st century, most of the Jews in Colombia are concentrated in [[Bogotá]], with about 20,000 members, and [[Barranquilla]], with about 7,000 members. Large communities are found in [[Cali]] and [[Medellín]], but very few practicing Jews. Smaller communities are found in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] and the island of [[San Andrés (island)|San Andres]].There are 14 official synagogues throughout the country. In Bogotá, the Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and German Jews each run their own religious and cultural institutions. The Confederación de Asociaciones Judías de Colombia, located in Bogotá, is the central organization that coordinates Jews and Jewish institutions in Colombia.

In the new millennium, after years of study, a group of non-ethnic Colombians with crypto-Jewish ancestry formally converted to Judaism in order to be accepted as Jews according to the halakha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jta.org/news/article/2009/06/18/1005984/mass-converts-pose-dilemma-for-latin-american-jews Florencia Arbiser, "Mass converts pose dilemma for Latin American Jews"], JTA, 18 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hua Tou''' (話頭, Korean: ''hwadu'', Japanese: ''wato'') is part of a form of [[Buddhist meditation]] known as Gongfu 工夫 (not to be confused with the Martial Arts 功夫 ) common in the teachings of [[Chan Buddhism]], [[Korean Seon]] and [[Rinzai school|Rinzai Zen]]. ''Hua Tou'' can be translated as 'word head', 'head of speech' or 'point beyond which speech exhausts itself'.{{sfn|Lachs|2012|p=2}} A ''Hua Tou'' can be a short phrase that is used as a subject of meditation to focus the mind.

==Origins==
''Hua Tou'' are based on the encounter-dialogues and [[koans]] of the interactions between past masters and students, but are shorter phrases than koans.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008}} The Hua Tou method was invented{{sfn|Schlütter|2008}} by the Chinese Zen master [[Dahui Zonggao]] (1089 – 1163) who was a member of the [[Linji school]].{{sfn|Lachs|2012|p=1}} Dahui was interested in teaching the lay community, particularly the educated Chinese [[scholar-officials]]. Support of those "literati" was essential for the survival of the individual lineages, since appointments as abbot of public monasteries were determined by this ruling class.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008}} Providing accessible methods of training for layman was a means to gather this necessary support.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008}} ''Hua Tou'' practice does not use regular interviews and question and answer sessions between student and teacher (dokusan).{{sfn|Lachs|2012|p=3}} According to Dahui, ''Hua Tou'' is also a form of meditation that "can be carried out by laymen in the midst of their daily activities."{{sfn|Lachs2012|p=4}}

Dahui was also against the intellectualism and literary commentary that had begun to enter into [[Koan]] practice with the [[Blue Cliff Record]] of his master Yuan-wu. In fact, Dahui burned his copy of the [[Blue Cliff Record]].

Formal Hua Tou practice was promoted in [[Korea]] by [[Korean Seon|Seon]] master [[Chinul]]. He was extremely successful in popularizing Hua Tou. According to Robert Buswell:&lt;ref name="buswell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buswell|first=Robert E.|title=Tracing Back the Radiance: Chinul's Korean Way of Zen (Classics in East Asian Buddhism)|year=1991|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0824814274|pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|Hwadu is the predominant technique cultivated in [Korean] meditation halls, and almost all masters advocate its use for students at all levels.}}

According to [[Bhikkhu Analayo]], a similar practice is found in the [[Atthakatha|Pali commentaries]] relating to mindfulness of bodily postures. Analayo writes that according to the Papañcasudani "the difference between simple walking and walking meditation as a [[Satipatthana]] is that a meditator keeps in mind the question: "Who goes? Whose is this going?"  (Ps I 251).&lt;ref&gt;Analayo, Satipatthana: the direct path to realization, page 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==

Dahui emphasised that initial insight is essential for Zen-training.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=107}} Dahui stressed that it was possible for laymen to achieve enlightenment through this practice. He often gave instructions through letters to his pupils.

Chinul described Hwadu (Hua Tou) in his treatise ''Dharma Collection and Special Practice Record'' ({{korean|hangul=법집별항녹절요사기|hanja=法集別行錄節要私記解|rr=Beopjip byeolhaeng nok jeolyo byeongip sagi}}) as a practice that leads to the very limits of speech and acts as a purification device.&lt;ref name="buswell" /&gt; Because the practice leads students beyond conceptual understanding, Chinul considered an advanced practice for those of particular talent, or those who had already advanced through other practices first.

To practice ''Hua Tou'', one concentrates on the phrase, initially repeating it silently with a questioning and open mind and then thinking about "Who" or "What" is generating the Hua Tou, this brings about "Great Doubt".{{sfn|Lachs|2012|p=10}} Hua Tou can be practiced during sitting meditation, after the mind has been calmed through an initial period of breath meditation. {{sfn|Yen|2009}}

[[Hsu Yun]] said of practicing Hua Tou: 
{{quote|The important thing is to stick to ''Hua Tou'' at all times, when walking, lying, or standing. From morning to night observing ''Hua Tou'' vividly and clearly, until it appears in your mind like the autumn moon reflected limpidly in quiet water. If you practice this way, you can be assured of reaching the state of Enlightenment.
In meditation, if you feel sleepy, you may open your eyes widely and straighten your back; you will then feel fresher and more alert than before.
When working on the ''Hua Tou'', you should be neither too subtle nor too loose. If you are too subtle you may feel very serene and comfortable, but you are apt to lose the ''Hua Tou''. The consequence will then be that you will fall into the ‘dead emptiness’.  Right in the state of serenity, if you do not lose the ''Hua Tou'', you may then be able to progress further than the top of the hundred-foot pole you have already ascended. If you are too loose, too many errant thoughts will attack you. You will then find it difficult to subdue them. In short, the Zen practitioner should be well adjusted, neither too tight nor too loose; in the looseness there should be tightness, and in the tightness there should be looseness.{{sfn|Yun|1970}}}}

According to Chan master [[Sheng Yen]], there are three stages of Hua Tou practice: reciting the Hua Tou, asking the Hua Tou and investigating the Hua Tou. {{sfn|Yen|2009|p=13}} Through these stages it is important not to try to answer the Hua Tou intellectually, but to persistently ask the question mindfully with genuine interest and sincere desire to know. {{sfn|Yen|2009|p=16}} It is through this constant practice that great doubt and then insight arises.

==Examples of Hua Tou==
*“What is it?”
*“What is this?”
*“Who is repeating the Buddha’s name?”
*“Who is dragging this corpse around?” (popularized by [[Hsu Yun]])
*“Who am I?”
*“What was my [[Original face]] before my father and mother were born?”
*“What is [[Mu (negative)|Mu]]?”{{refn|group=note|Favored by [[Sheng Yen]]{{sfn|Yen|2009}}}}

'''Ignacio Antonio Velasco García, S.D.B.''' (January 17, 1929, [[Acarigua]], [[Venezuela]] – July 6, 2003) was a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Caracas|Archbishop of Caracas]]. He received that post on 27 May 1995, and held it until his death.  He was known for his criticisms of [[President of Venezuela|Venezuelan President]] [[Hugo Chávez]].  During the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt]], Cardinal Velasco was the first of 400 signatories to sign the [[Carmona Decree]]. After Velasco's death, Chávez drew fire for his controversial statement that the Cardinal was "burning in hell".

Islam is one of the major religions practiced widely in [[Ghana]]. Its presence in Ghana dates back to the 10th century. The population of Muslims in Ghana is about 20%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.religionfacts.com/charts/adherents-by-country&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Muslims in Ghana are followers of [[Sunni Islam]], with approximately 20% belonging to the [[Ahmadiyya]] movement and approximately 8% belonging to [[Shia]] Islam.&lt;ref name= "TheWorld'sMuslims:UnityandDiversity"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Muslim/the-worlds-muslims-full-report.pdf | title=The World's Muslims: Unity and Diversity | accessdate=25 February 2016| date=August 9, 2012 | publisher=Pew Forum on Religious &amp; Public life| pages=16, 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Maliki]] school of [[jurisprudence]] was the most common until [[Afa Ajura]]'s reformist activities in the 1960s saw an overwhelming shift toward [[Hanbali#Theology|Hanbali doctrine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/webclient/StreamGate?folder_id=0&amp;dvs=1418408874889~396 | title=The decline of Sufism in West Africa: Some factor contributing to the political and social ascendancy of Wahhabist Islam in Northern Ghana| publisher=Institute of Islamic Studies - McGill University | author=Mohammad Saani, Ibrahim | year=2011 | location=Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufism, once widespread, has waned considerably over the years; the [[Tijaniyah]] and the [[Qadiriyah]] brotherhoods, however, are still represented among Ghana's traditionalist Muslims.

Despite tensions in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] since the mid-1970s, Muslims and Christians in Ghana have had excellent relations. Guided by the authority of the Muslim Representative Council, religious, social, and economic matters affecting Muslims have often been redressed through negotiations. The [[National Hajj Council (Ghana)|National Hajj Council]] observes the responsibility of arranging pilgrimages to [[Mecca]] for believers who can afford the journey.&lt;ref name= "TheWorld'sMuslims:UnityandDiversity"/&gt; The [[Chief Imam of Ghana|National Chief Imam of Ghana]] is the highest authority on Muslim affairs in Ghana.

Some metropolitan areas and cities, especially in areas with a significant Muslim population, have Islamic or Arabic schools offering primary, junior secondary, senior secondary and tertiary education.

==History of Islam in Ghana==
Islam made a momentous entry into the Northern Territories of Ghana at the beginning of the fifteenth century, mainly due to commercial (trading) activities of sahelian tribes of West Africa. Prior to that, [[Dawah|Da'wah workers]] had made contact and written extensively about the people including inhabitants of [[Bonoman|Bonoman states]] located in the hinterlands of contemporary Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.islamicpopulation.com/africa/ghana/islam_in_ghana_report.htm | title=Islam in Ghana - Report | publisher=IslamicPopulation.com | work=HI/OB/IINA | accessdate=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The introduction of Islam into [[Ghana]] was mainly the result of the commercial activities of Mande and Hausa Speaking traders.
===Spread of Islam in Ghana===
The arrival and spread of Islam in Ghana followed several and different pathways; the [[Mandé peoples|Mandens]] came through the North and North-Western corridors of Ghana while the [[Borno state|Borno]] and [[Hausa people|Hausa]] peoples came through the North-East. Islam is thought to have successfully penetrated southern Ghana following the "collapse of the Bono and the Begho states, and its increase was encouraged by the fact that the slave trade became more lucrative and competitive".&lt;ref name="oasis"/&gt; Furthermore, the British colonial government in the nineteenth century enlisted people from various northern predominantly Muslim communities into the colonial army. Finally, the mass exodus of immigrants into forest areas of Ghana following the ''[[1892 Sack of Salaga]]'' by joint forces of [[Kingdom of Dagbon|Dagomba]], Namumba and [[Gonja people|Gonja]] Kingdoms significantly depleted Muslim populations in the North while boosting that of the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Salaga: The Struggle for Power | publisher=Historical Society of Ghana | author=J.

==Population of Muslims in Ghana==
[[Image:Larabanga Mosque Northern Ghana.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Larabanga Mosque]], built in the 15th century. Taken in March 2006.]]Muslim population is concentrated in Northern Ghana and in Zongo communities scattered across the country.

The Coalition of Muslim Organizations maintain that the final figures released in 2002 "contained serious flaws and as a result could not be used as reliable data for planning and projecting the country’s development agenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsfromafrica.org/newsfromafrica/articles/art_7902.html |title=Muslims cry foul over population figures |date=2002 |agency=NewsFromAfrica |accessdate=December 17, 2014 |author=Amos Safo |location=Ghana |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502031906/http://www.newsfromafrica.org/newsfromafrica/articles/art_7902.html |archivedate=May  2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2006/71304.htm | title=International Religious Freedom Report 2006 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor | work=US State Department | accessdate=December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The call came at the same time groups mainly from the North petitioned the government to withdraw the results, expressing concern that some ethnic groups were underrepresented in the population count and that the service should open up their procedures for public scrutiny.

===Ahmadiyya===
{{Main|Ahmadiyya in Ghana}}
The Ahmadiyya Muslim community, formally established in 1921, is the oldest continuous Muslim community in Ghana. Ahmadi Muslims were among the earliest Muslim missionaries in Ghana, and by 1957, they had converted over 100,000 (mostly Christian) people to Islam.&lt;ref name="oasis"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oasiscenter.eu/articles/interreligious-dialogue/2007/10/01/ghana-if-islam-becomes-an-enigma | title=Ghana, if Islam Becomes an Enigma | publisher=Oasiscenter | date=1 October 2007 | accessdate=December 19, 2014 | author=Turkson, Peter-K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="samwuni"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Muslim Resurgence in Ghana Since 1950: Its Effects Upon Muslims and Muslim-Christian Relations Christentum und Islam Im Dialog Christian - Muslim Relations Series Volume 7 of Christentum und Islam im Dialog Christian - Muslim Relations | publisher=LIT Verlag Münster | author=Nathan Samwini | year=2006 | pages=342 | isbn=9783825889913}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Ahmadi missionary to Ghana, [[Abdul Rahim Nayyar|Maulvi Abdul Rahim Nayyar]], came upon invitation from Muslims in [[Saltpond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jamiaghana.org/about/ | title=Jamia Ahmadiyya International Ghana | publisher=Jamiaghana.org | accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 16%, Ghana hosts the largest proportion of Ahmadi Muslims to the wider Muslim population by country.&lt;ref name="pew"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2012/08/the-worlds-muslims-full-report.pdf | title=The World’s Muslims: Unity and Diversity | publisher=Pew Research Centre | date=9 August 2012 | accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sufi===
{{See also|Sufism}}
[[Sufism]] is the most traditional form of Islam in Ghana because of its long presence, close association and tolerance for the culture of the indigenous peoples even though they have never come together to form an establishment or a unified community.&lt;ref name="salm"&gt;{{cite book | title=Culture and Customs of Ghana | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | author=Steven J. Salm | authorlink=Toyin Falola | year=2002 | pages=224 | isbn=9780313320507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Sufi orders represented in Ghana are the [[Tijaniyya]] and [[Qadiriyya]]. Sufism is common among the immigrant Muslim population of Ghana, also known as the Zongos. Sufis make up 27 percent of Muslims in Ghana.&lt;ref name="pew"/&gt;

===Sunni===
{{See also|Sunni Islam}}
Sunni Islam was introduced into Ghana as part of the 1940s reformist activities of late Ghanaian [[Mujaddid]], [[Afa Ajura]]. Afa Ajura's campaign challenged the status quo of the Sufi doctrine and pitted him against the already establish Sufi social structures. It was not until the 1970s that his message gained wide acceptance, resulting in a majority of Muslims, 51 percent (2014),&lt;ref name = "pew"/&gt; now affiliating with the [[Anbariya Sunni Community|Anbariyya Sunni Community]]. For most of its established time in Ghana, Sunni Islam was propagated across the country in [[Dagbani language|Dagbanli]] - the mother tongue of Afa Ajura. Recently Sunni adherents in Zongo communities in southern Ghana (18% of Muslims)&lt;ref name = "pew"/&gt; have formed the "Ahlusunnah wal Jamaa" (ASWaJ) organization in order to reach the Hausa-speaking population. ASWaJ still draws inspiration from their parent Anbariyya leadership, headed by [[Afa Seidu]] in Tamale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=126047 | title=Al Sunni Muslim sect gets new leader | work=GNA | date=23 June 2007 | agency=Ghana Web | accessdate=December 19, 2014 | location=Tamale Ghana}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://waljamaa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=8 | title=Brief history of the coming together of the Ahlusunnah wal Jama'a in Ghana | accessdate=December 19, 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219201153/http://waljamaa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=8 | archivedate=December 19, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anbariyya"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.anbariya.com/v1/ | title=Anbariya Sunni Community | accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joshua Michael Homme''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɒ|m|i}} {{respell|HOM|ee}};&lt;ref&gt;Listen {{Audio|Josh Homme says his name.ogg| Josh Homme pronounces his name, 647k OGG file}}, taken from an interview with [[KBZT]] radio station, May 19, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; born May 17, 1973) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, and actor. He is the founder and only continuous member of the [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Queens of the Stone Age]], in which he sings, plays guitar, as well as occasionally playing piano, drums, and bass. He also serves as the band's primary songwriter.

Homme was formerly a guitarist and founder of the [[stoner rock]] band [[Kyuss]]. He co-founded and occasionally performs with [[Eagles of Death Metal]], playing drums and bass for their studio recordings, and produces a [[Musical improvisation|musical improv]] series with other musicians, mostly from the [[Palm Desert Scene]], known as [[The Desert Sessions]]. In 2009, he formed a new project called [[Them Crooked Vultures]] with [[Dave Grohl]] and [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], who released [[Them Crooked Vultures (album)|their debut album]] that same year. In 2016, he released ''[[Post Pop Depression]]'', an album with [[Iggy Pop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/arts/music/iggy-pop-josh-homme-post-pop-depression.html|title=Iggy Pop and Joshua Homme Team Up for Secret Album|date=January 24, 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been involved with numerous other projects, including [[Arctic Monkeys]] and [[Biffy Clyro]].

==Early life==
Joshua Michael Homme was born in [[Joshua Tree, California]] on May 17, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/calbirths?c=search&amp;first=Joshua&amp;last=Homme&amp;spelling=Exact&amp;4_year=&amp;4_month=0&amp;4_day=0&amp;5=&amp;7=&amp;SubmitSearch.x=28&amp;SubmitSearch.y=14|title=California Birth Records|accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in an affluent family in [[Palm Desert, California]]. His paternal grandfather, Cap, moved to the area from [[North Dakota]]. Homme's surname is of Norwegian origin and is believed to come from the town of [[Valle, Norway|Valle]]. His additional ancestry includes English, French-Canadian, German, Jewish, and Swedish.{{cn|date=September 2018}} The Homme family have a local street named after them in a golfing community, and Cap has a park named after him in an exclusive enclave of the [[Coachella Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/queens-of-the-stone-age/queens-of-the-stone-age-you-work-first-then-party-later-feature |title=Queens of the Stone Age: "You work first, then party later…" |publisher=Uncut.co.uk |date=Spring 2007 |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Homme discussed having to "create your own fun" as a child growing up in the desert, stating that he did not start playing music to "get girls or make money" and that he assumed that he would grow up to be "a good contractor like [his] dad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchannel.com/TV_Shows/Anthony_Bourdain/Episodes_Travel_Guides/Us_Desert|title=Travel Channel, Anthony Bourdain No Reservations|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homme also has ties in [[Idaho]] and has talked in the past about spending summers there, including shaping experiences such as seeing [[Carl Perkins]] perform at the [[Sandpoint, Idaho|Sandpoint]] Music Festival and buying his first electric guitar (his Ovation Ultra GP) in a Sandpoint music store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w799Wv-iQIQ&amp;list=PLB8CBB1DFBAC6B141&amp;index=22 |title=Musical Memories with Josh Homme |publisher=YouTube |date=October 16, 2012 |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6Z69gGt1kY |title=Josh Homme – Guitarings Interview Part 2 |publisher=YouTube |date=November 15, 2011 |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began playing guitar at the age of nine, after his parents denied his wishes for a drum kit. He took [[polka]] lessons on guitar from ages nine to eleven, during which he supposedly did not learn of a [[barre chord]] for the first two years, nor of a [[plectrum|pick]] until his third year, lending to his unique playing style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJDUHq2mJx0 |title=Josh Homme – Guitar Moves – Episode 3 |publisher=YouTube |date=May 29, 2013 |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homme joined his first band, Autocracy, in 1985, at the age of 12.

==Career==
===Kyuss (1987–1995)===
{{Main|Kyuss}}
In 1987, when he was 14 years old, Homme formed a [[punk rock]]-influenced [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band with schoolmates [[John Garcia (singer)|John Garcia]] and [[Brant Bjork]] in Palm Desert called Katzenjammer; he was the band's guitarist. After changing their name a few times, first to Sons of Kyuss (they released an [[Sons of Kyuss EP|EP of the same name]]), they finally shortened it to Kyuss. The band garnered a [[cult following]] by the early 1990s, often driving for hours to isolated locations in the desert and plugging into generators to perform. These events, known as "generator parties", became [[urban legend]] among rock [[subculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = Billik |first = Kira L. |title = Confused punk rockers' have an identity crisis |newspaper =[[Buffalo News]] |pages =G3 |date =March 14, 1993|url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band became both famous for their heavy, down tuned, groove oriented music, and infamous for their backstage fights with local LA bands when they traveled into town to play gigs. This soon brought the attention of [[Chris Goss]], who became the band's mentor, helping the band sign to a label and producing them exclusively in an effort to preserve their sound. Due to Homme being younger than 18 at the time of the band's signing, his parents had to sign on his behalf. Kyuss released three major label albums, ''[[Blues for the Red Sun]]'', ''[[Welcome to Sky Valley]]'', and ''[[...And the Circus Leaves Town]]'', all of which are often cited as cornerstones to the development of the [[stoner rock]] genre in the 1990s. Kyuss partially reformed in 2010 (now known as [[Vista Chino]]), but Homme opted out of the reunion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=KYUSS Lives Without JOSH HOMME |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=November 2, 2010 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=148693 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105114651/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=148693 |archivedate=November 5, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queens of the Stone Age (1996–present)===
{{Main|Queens of the Stone Age}}

When Kyuss split up in 1995, Homme joined the [[Screaming Trees]] as a rhythm guitarist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.thefade.net/oldsite/articles/roughedge98xxxx.html|title =Queens of the Stone Age Review|accessdate =May 9, 2007|author =Christopher J. Kelter|year= 1998|publisher =Rough Edge.com|language =}}&lt;/ref&gt; touring but not recording with the band. He and vocalist [[Mark Lanegan]] became close friends during this time. Disliking the band's continual disharmony, Homme left after just over one year with them. He founded [[Gamma Ray (EP)|Gamma Ray]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefade.net/oldsite/discography/gammaray.html|title=Discography entry for ''Gamma Ray''|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=TheFade.net|language=|access-date=|accessdate=May 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; a group more centered to his unique style and tastes, which later became Queens of the Stone Age in 1997. The first release under this name would be the ''[[Kyuss/Queens of the Stone Age]]'' compilation EP featuring tracks from both Kyuss and songs recorded from the Gamma Ray sessions. Shortly thereafter, Queens of the Stone Age released their [[Queens of the Stone Age (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1998. Originally, Homme had asked a number of singers, including Lanegan, to perform as lead vocalist for Queens of the Stone Age, but ended up singing for the first time in his career.

Following their debut album, Queens of the Stone Age released the next album, ''[[Rated R (Queens of the Stone Age album)|Rated R]]'', during which the band used a wider range of instruments to achieve a more relaxed, spacious and psychedelic sound.&lt;ref name="Rated R Review"&gt;{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r479243|pure_url=yes}}|title=AllMusic – Rated R Review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=June 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it differed from the band's debut, ''Rated R''  became Queens of the Stone Age's first mainstream hit. The next release, 2002's ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]'', however, would gain even more buzz from the music community and fans alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/q/queens_of_the_stoneage/news_feature_032805 |title=Queens of the Stone Age: A Stone Unturned |publisher=MTV.com |date=March 9, 2006 |accessdate=October 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612182931/http://www.mtv.com/bands/q/queens_of_the_stoneage/news_feature_032805/ |archivedate=June 12, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Songs for the Deaf'', Homme continued his filtering of [[stoner rock]] and hard rock. The album centers on Homme's memories of uncomfortable rides through the California desert, where he had performed in his days with Kyuss, and where there was little to do but listen to Spanish [[Radio broadcasting|radio stations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/queensofthestoneage/articles/story/5933801/qotsa_enjoying_life_with_dave|title = QOTSA Enjoying Life With Dave|publisher = Rolling Stone|date = May 3, 2002|accessdate = June 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Homme had a falling out with bassist and friend [[Nick Oliveri]]. Following the release of ''Songs for the Deaf'', their relationship deteriorated until Homme fired Oliveri from the band in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cohen |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/62176/homme-comes-clean-on-oliveri-firing |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] |title=Homme Comes Clean on Oliveri Firing |date=July 6, 2005 |accessdate=May 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homme began writing their next album, ''[[Lullabies to Paralyze]]'', named after a lyric from the ''Songs for the Deaf'' hidden track "Mosquito Song". ''Lullabies to Paralyze'' debuted at number five on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was QOTSA's best charting album on the ''Billboard'' 200 to date.

Queens of the Stone Age's fifth album, ''[[Era Vulgaris (album)|Era Vulgaris]]'', was released in early June 2007 and received generally positive reviews from critics.&lt;ref name="Metacriticrating"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/queensofthestoneage/eravulgaris?q=era%20vulgaris |title = Era Vulgaris, Metacritic rating |accessdate = August 10, 2007 |publisher= [[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amgreview"&gt;{{cite web|url = {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1069665|pure_url=yes}} |title = Queens of the Stone Age, Era Vulgaris |accessdate = August 10, 2007 |author = Thomas Erlewine, Stephen |publisher = [[AllMusic]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="observerreview"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/reviews/story/0,,2080716,00.html |title = Queens of the Stone Age, Era Vulgaris |accessdate = May 20, 2007 |author = Hodgson, Jaimie |date = May 20, 2007 |publisher = The Observer |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the album's touring cycle, the band took a break to focus on individual projects, during which Homme continued to produce and create more records outside the band. This break would unintentionally turn into a six-year gap between albums.

In 2010, following his work with rock [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Them Crooked Vultures]], Homme began performing more live shows with QOTSA. Following a deluxe reissue of ''Rated R'', a 2011 re-release of their debut album and corresponding tour followed, featuring the album played front to back in the style in which it was recorded.  This was the first time many of the songs had been performed live since the album's original release.

On June 4, 2013, after a tumultuous writing and recording process, Queens of the Stone Age released their sixth album, ''[[...Like Clockwork]]'', receiving high praise from critics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.metacritic.com/music/like-clockwork/queens-of-the-stone-age|title=...Like Clockwork Reviews|publisher=Metacritic.com|date=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as topping the Billboard 200 charts.

===The Desert Sessions (1997–present)===
{{Main|The Desert Sessions}}
Homme founded The Desert Sessions in 1997 at the [[Rancho De La Luna]] in [[Joshua Tree, California]], describing it as a musical collective series "that cannot be defined". He stated:

{{quote|At Desert Sessions, you play for the sake of music. That's why it's good for musicians. If someday that's not enough anymore, or that's not the reason behind you doing it – that's not your ''raison d'être'' – then a quick reminder like Desert Sessions can do so much for you, it's amazing. It's easy to forget that this all starts from playing in your garage and loving it.}}

The recordings are done "on the spot" in a matter of hours, and the line-up constantly changes, with new contributors being added for each new recording. Artists such as [[PJ Harvey]], [[Jeordie White|Twiggy Ramirez]], [[Dave Catching]], [[Nick Oliveri]], [[Mark Lanegan]], [[Ben Shepherd]], [[John McBain (musician)|John McBain]], [[Josh Freese]], [[Chris Goss]], [[Alain Johannes]], [[Dean Ween]], and many others from the [[Palm Desert Scene]] have contributed to The Desert Sessions recordings.

So far, ten volumes from The Desert Sessions have been released. Homme has stated to ''[[NME]]'', among others, that he would record more material with The Desert Sessions.

===Eagles of Death Metal (1998–present)===
{{Main|Eagles of Death Metal}}
In 1998, Homme formed Eagles of Death Metal with friend [[Jesse Hughes (musician)|Jesse Hughes]]. Recordings from this project first appeared on Homme's ''The Desert Sessions Volumes 3 &amp; 4'', released that year. Over the next few years, Homme became distracted from EoDM due to the success of Queens of the Stone Age. However, in an October 2008 interview, he re-affirmed his commitment to the band saying, "This isn't a side project for me. I'm in two bands. I have musical schizophrenia, and this is one of those personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Eagles+of+Death+Metal+Part+1%3A+Joshua+Homme/ |title = Eagles of Death Metal Part 1: Joshua Homme |publisher = [[SuicideGirls.com]] |date = October 30, 2008 |accessdate = October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So far the band has released four albums: ''[[Peace, Love, Death Metal]]'' in 2004, ''[[Death by Sexy]]'' in 2006, ''[[Heart On]]'' in 2008 and most recently ''[[Zipper Down]]'' in 2015. Due to his commitments with Queens of the Stone Age and other projects, Homme does not regularly tour with Eagles of Death Metal, but occasionally makes appearances during live performances.

===Them Crooked Vultures (2009–present)===

The video marked the end of Campbell's musical career, a retrospect on his life following his decision to retire following his diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

Homme made a very brief cameo at the end of [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White's]] music video for "Freedom at 21", playing a police officer who intercepts White at a roadblock following White's escapades throughout the video.

==Personal life==
On December 3, 2005, Homme married singer and musician [[Brody Dalle]] of [[The Distillers]]. They reside in [[Palm Springs, California]] with their daughter, Camille Harley Joan Homme (born January 17, 2006), and two sons, Orrin Ryder Homme (born August 12, 2011) and Wolf Dillon Reece Homme (born February 13, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/brody-dalle/91585|work=NME|title=Josh Homme and Brody Dalle announce birth of third child, Wolf|date=February 17, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2016|author=Gamp, Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homme has over 20 tattoos. On his knuckles, he has his grandparents' nicknames ("Cam" for "Camille" on the left and "Cap" on the right) with hearts and his two sons' names ("ORH" for "Orrin Ryder Homme" and "Wolf"). He has his daughter's name, also Camille, tattooed over his heart. His left arm has a switchblade with "Stay Sharp" underneath, while his inner right arm has a [[straight-edge razor]] with "Born to Win" inscribed; underneath, his nickname, "Baby Duck", is a shared tattoo with his [[Eagles of Death Metal]] bandmate [[Jesse Hughes (musician)|Jesse Hughes]], who has his nickname "Boots Electric" in the same location. Homme also shares a tattoo that says "Freitag 4:15" with former Queens of the Stone Age bandmates [[Nick Oliveri]] and [[Mark Lanegan]] and their sound engineer Hutch, commemorating their "worst show ever" at the [[Rock Am Ring]] Festival in Germany on Friday, June 1, 2001, at 4:15 pm. They all got the tattoo on their ribs so that it would hurt the most and serve as a reminder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanishingtattoo.com/tattoo/celeb-homme.htm|title=JOSH HOMME TATTOO GALLERY|accessdate=October 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNe6nsnoz2I&amp;feature=channel|title=JOSH HOMME Fan question on YouTube|accessdate=October 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6Z69gGt1kY&amp;feature=relmfu |title=Josh Homme – Guitarings Interview Part 2 |publisher=YouTube |date=November 15, 2011 |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homme said that he "died" of [[asphyxia]]tion for a short time in 2010, following unexpected complications during knee surgery. He contracted a [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] infection, which his immune system could not fight due to stress. Doctors eventually used a [[defibrillator]] to revive him following the asphyxiation. The experience left him weakened and unable to produce music for almost two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_431_-_josh_homme|title=Mark Maron podcast: Episode 431 – Josh Homme}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, he was confined to his bed for three months and plunged into a deep [[Depression (mood)|depression]], considering giving up his music career. He has said that this experience greatly contributed to the making of the Queens of the Stone Age album ''[[...Like Clockwork]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/queens-of-the-stone-age/54615|title=Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme: I died on a hospital table|accessdate=May 23, 2013 |format=article |work=NME}}&lt;/ref&gt; He credits [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] with helping him recover.&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone 10/13"&gt;{{cite web|title=Josh Homme 'Really Thankful' for Near-Death Experience|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/josh-homme-really-thankful-for-near-death-experience-20131011|accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, he alluded that the story about his knee surgery may have been created by "somebody else", adding that he went "in too deep" involving drugs and sank into a depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=#260:Josh Homme/Queens of the Stone Age|url=https://soundcloud.com/deandelray/260josh-hommequeens-of-the-stone-age|accessdate=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2008 Norwegian Wood festival in [[Oslo]], Homme drew criticism for his reaction to an audience member who had thrown a shoe at him during the song "[[3's &amp; 7's]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/51310-josh-homme-wigs-out-on-bottle-tosser-at-qotsa-gig |title=Josh Homme Wigs Out on Bottle Tosser at QOTSA Gig |publisher=Pitchforkmedia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217215202/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/51310-josh-homme-wigs-out-on-bottle-tosser-at-qotsa-gig |archivedate=December 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/queens-of-the-stone-age/37399|title=Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme bottles fan|publisher=NME}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homme called the audience member a "chicken-shit fucking faggot" and "a 12-year-old dickless fucking turd". The incident drew accusations of [[homophobia]] from several blogs, which were then picked up by the mainstream media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/soundboard/2008/06/reporters-noteb.html |title=Reporter's Notebook: Why doesn't Josh Homme's homophobic rant mean the end of Queens of the Stone Age? |author=August Brown |publisher=Los Angeles Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516214035/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/soundboard/2008/06/reporters-noteb.html |archivedate=May 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spike.com/blog/josh-homme-bottles/65649|title=Josh Homme Bottles a Fan in the Face|publisher=Spike.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homme replied with a lengthy public letter denying all accusations of homophobia, and stated that the tirade was aggravated by food poisoning and a high fever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Patrik Wirén |url=http://rogertsblogg.blogspot.com/2008/06/josh-homme-lackar-ur.html |title=Rogers blogg.

Following a 2013 performance by QOTSA at [[Jay-Z]]'s Made in America Festival, Homme made comments about Jay-Z during a radio interview with CBC Radio 2's ''Strombo Show''. He explained that his band was frisked by the event's security team prior to the performance and referred to Jay-Z's personal interaction with the band as a marketing stunt:

{{cquote|[Jay-Z] has his security frisking the bands on the way in. I just told them if you open up my bag I'm not playing so I guess it's up to you whether we are playing or not... the idea they frisked all my guys, means you're in some different place, no-one has ever done that [to me]... he also gave us some champagne and wanted us to take a photo with it. And I thought, that's not a gift, that is a marketing tool. So I destroyed it. Because I thought it was rude overall. And you shouldn't frisk my guys, you should fuck off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Josh Homme has 99 problems and Jay Z is one|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/36955/Josh-Homme-has-99-problems-and-Jay-Z-is-one|work=Faster Louder|publisher=Faster Louder Pty Ltd|accessdate=September 20, 2013|author=Sarah Smith|date=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2016, Homme was involved in a verbal altercation with autograph seller Jason Leckrone, who eyewitnesses said was taunting Homme for not signing autographs. Homme began to argue with Leckrone and called him an "entitled, spoiled motherfucker".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harrison|first1=Scoop|title=Josh Homme shames professional autograph vulture|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/04/josh-homme-shames-professional-autograph-vulture/|publisher=Consequence of Sound|accessdate=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Leckrone filed a lawsuit against Homme for assault and battery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/HommeTMZ.pdf Leckrone v. Homme] PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, Homme was captured on video kicking the camera of [[Shutterstock]] photographer Chelsea Lauren into her face during [[KROQ]]'s Almost Christmas concert in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="NYDN-2017-12"&gt;{{cite web|title=Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme kicks photographer in head|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/queens-stone-age-josh-homme-kicks-photographer-head-article-1.3689638|website=NY Daily News|accessdate=December 10, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After staying through the show and photographing subsequent bands, Lauren went to [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] for treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baltin |first=Steve |url=https://variety.com/2017/music/news/josh-homme-kicks-female-photographer-in-the-head-at-kroq-acoustic-christmas-exclusive-1202635338/ |title=Queens of the Stone Age’s Josh Homme Kicks Female Photographer in the Head – Variety |publisher=Variety.com |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement, Homme claimed that he had been kicking over lighting equipment and was unaware that he had kicked Lauren until he was informed of it the next day. Lauren disputed this, stating that Homme had made eye contact with her before kicking her.&lt;ref name="abc kick"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-11/josh-homme-queens-of-stone-age-kicks-photographer-in-the-face/9245666|title=Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age sorry for kicking female photographer in the face|work=abc.net.au|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=December 11, 2017|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after the incident, Homme issued a video response, in which he admitted to kicking Lauren and apologized to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Josh Homme: 'Truly Sorry' for Kicking Photographer Onstage|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/josh-homme-truly-sorry-for-kicking-photographer-onstage-w513724|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2543">'''Leo Hanin''' (born 20 November 1913 in [[Vilnius]]) was a Zionist activist.

Born into a Jewish family in [[Vilna]] (Wilno, Vilnius), then in [[Russian Empire]], he and his family left for [[Harbin]], Manchuria (northern China), in 1916. There Leo joined a Zionist group and studied Jewish history at a Jewish primary school, and then studied at a Russian secondary school. When Japan occupied Manchuria in 1931, he went to [[Shanghai]] where attended a British school, and also served in the Jewish Shanghai Volunteer Corps. He was a leader of Shanghai [[Betar]], the Revisionist Zionist youth organization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tzd0QNVI1bQC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;dq=%22Leo+Hanin%22+zionist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6KafglJzcj&amp;sig=OUkQ582O76-1cidGR4fsklXmWIw&amp;hl=pl&amp;ei=jjFaS8nOLJGemwO6xZimAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Leo%20Hanin%22%20zionist&amp;f=true The Jews of China]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, he moved to [[Kobe]], Japan, to work in a textile firm. The small Jewish community there elected him its honorary secretary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.footnote.com/page/94112582_leo_hanin/&lt;/ref&gt; From August 1940 to November 1941 two thousand Polish-Lithuanian Jewish refugees, who were saved from the Holocaust by the Japanese viceconsul in [[Kaunas]], Lithuania, [[Chiune Sugihara]], arrived into Kobe. The Jewish community helped them by finding homes, donating medical supplies and clothing, and arranging, by the Polish ambassador to Japan [[Tadeusz Romer]], their visas so they could stay on in Japan.

In 1942 he returned to Shanghai and spent the rest of the war working there. He emigrated to Israel in 1948 and next moved to the United States in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aufrichtigs.com/01-Holocaust/Egon_Aufrichtig/Egon_Aufrichtig_-_Big_Heart.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

He described the Jewish community in Kobe and its activities in a special interview in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn506696&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Maggie Gallagher was born on September 14, 1960 to William Walter Gallagher Sr. and the former Darrilyn Doris Stenz. She is originally from [[Lake Oswego, Oregon]], where she attended [[Lakeridge High School]]. She has three siblings: Kathleen, William Jr., and Colleen.&lt;ref name="ancestry1"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=86401&amp;id=I00629
 | title = Amos, Capron, Carnes family
 | accessdate = October 5, 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents were initially active in their local Catholic parish, but her mother left the Church when she was 8, but remained interested in spirituality, while Maggie became what she later described as a "[[pro-life]] atheist" and a reader of [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Robert A. Heinlein]].

In 1982, she earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in Religious Studies from [[Yale University]], where she belonged to the [[Party of the Right (Yale)|Party of the Right]] in the [[Yale Political Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouthinstitute.org/image_lib/pi_program.pdf|title=Schedule of Events|date=June 2009|publisher=Portsmouth Institute|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Yale she tried [[marijuana]] once but did not like it.&lt;ref name="salon.com"&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2012/02/08/the_making_of_gay_marriages_top_foe/ The making of gay marriage’s top foe]. Salon.com (February 8, 2012). Retrieved on 2016-05-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 2010, she returned to the Union to debate against same-sex marriage with opponent [[Evan Wolfson]], executive director of Freedom to Marry and fellow alumnus of the Yale Political Union. Shortly before she was due to graduate, she fell pregnant after a relationship with a fellow party member. She gave birth to a son out of wedlock.&lt;ref name="mgbio"/&gt; She initially planned to put the baby up for adoption but then changed her mind. Neither of the parents thought that they should marry.

She said that the father eventually abandoned her and became uninterested in their child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oppenheimer|first=Mark|title=The Making of Gay Marriage's Top Foe|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/02/08/the_making_of_gay_marriages_top_foe/|publisher=Salon.com|accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her twenties, she reverted to Catholicism because her experience as a single mother made her consider the necessity of fathers and the linkage of sex to procreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tennis |first=Cary |url=http://www.salon.com/2012/02/08/the_making_of_gay_marriages_top_foe/ |title=The making of gay marriage’s top foe by Mark Oppenheimer at Salon |publisher=Salon.com |date= |accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallagher married Raman Srivastav, a [[Hindu]], in 1993&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they have one son together.

Gallagher attended the premiere reading of ''[[8 (play)|8]]'', [[Dustin Lance Black]]'s play about the trial surrounding California's Proposition 8, where a depiction of her was performed by [[Jayne Houdyshell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.towleroad.com/2011/09/anti-gay-nom-activist-maggie-gallagher-attends-staged-broadway-benefit-for-team-challenging-proposit.html |title=Anti-Gay NOM Activist Maggie Gallagher Attends Staged Broadway Benefit for Team Challenging Proposition 8&amp;#124; Gay News |publisher=Towleroad |date=September 20, 2011 |accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She expressed the opinion that most  people would find the work "kind of dull".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://berkshireonstage.com/2012/01/17/8-dustin-lance-blacks-marriage-equality-play-to-be-part-of-williamstown-theatre-festival-2012/ |title=The Story Behind "8" – the Courtroom Drama about Marriage Equality |publisher=Berkshire On Stage |date=January 17, 2012 |accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Los Angeles performance, the Gallagher role was performed by [[Jane Lynch]].

On January 2, 2013, she announced the retirement of her syndicated column, then distributed by [[Universal Uclick]].&lt;ref name=MGRetiredColumn /&gt;

==Social views==
Gallagher is a [[Roman Catholic]] and a [[social conservative]].&lt;ref name="Conservative Chronicle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativechronicle.com/default.asp?sourceid=&amp;smenu=94&amp;twindow=Default&amp;mad=No&amp;sdetail=&amp;wpage=&amp;skeyword=&amp;sidate=&amp;ccat=&amp;ccatm=&amp;restate=&amp;restatus=&amp;reoption=&amp;retype=&amp;repmin=&amp;repmax=&amp;rebed=&amp;rebath=&amp;subname=&amp;pform=&amp;sc=2048&amp;hn=conservativechronicle&amp;he=.com |title=Conservative Chronicle |publisher=Conservative Chronicle |date=July 15, 2009 |accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is a signatory of the [[Manhattan Declaration: A Call of Christian Conscience|Manhattan Declaration]], a November 2009 ecumenical statement calling on Orthodox, Catholic, and Evangelical Christians not to comply with rules and laws permitting abortion, same-sex marriage and other matters against their religious consciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manhattandeclaration.org/the-declaration/read.aspx |title=Read the Declaration: A Call of Christian Conscience |publisher=Manhattandeclaration.org |date= |accessdate=February 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706023913/http://www.manhattandeclaration.org/the-declaration/read.aspx |archivedate=July 6, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on abortion===
Gallagher opposes [[abortion]] and believes that ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' should be overturned. She believes that most people who support legal abortion do so reluctantly because they think it is a necessary evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Maggie Gallagher |url=http://townhall.com/columnists/MaggieGallagher/2003/01/27/failed_promises_of_abortion |title=Failed promises of abortion |publisher=Townhall.com |date=January 27, 2003 |accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on assisted suicide===
Gallagher is opposed to the legalization of [[assisted suicide]] such as the [[Oregon Death with Dignity Act|Death with Dignity Act]] or [[voluntary euthanasia]]. Gallagher believes that state-approved suicide diminishes the value of life, especially for the elderly, sick, or vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Maggie | last= Gallagher |url=http://townhall.com/columnists/MaggieGallagher/2004/06/02/assisted_suicide_gives_medical_credence_to_self-destruction |title=Assisted suicide gives medical credence to self-destruction |publisher= Townhall.com |date= June 2, 2004 |accessdate= February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on marriage===
Gallagher is a strong opponent of the legal recognition of same-sex unions and has written books toward that end. Gallagher holds that one of the purposes of marriage is always procreation and rearing children exclusively by heterosexual parents,&lt;ref name="whymarriage"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/269352/the-stakes/maggie-gallagher |title=Why we need marriage |author=Gallagher, Maggie |date=July 14, 2003 |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |publisher=[[National Review]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806085511/http://article.nationalreview.com/269352/the-stakes/maggie-gallagher |archivedate=August 6, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and argues that same-sex unions diminish the value of heterosexual marriages. Gallagher has compared winning the fight to ban same-sex marriage with the fall of communism and believes that if same-sex marriage is made legal, it will mean "losing American civilization."&lt;ref name=whymarriage /&gt;

Gallagher advocates litigation against spouses who commit adultery and opposes laws which facilitate [[no-fault divorce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://townhall.com/columnists/MaggieGallagher/2010/03/17/the_right_to_adultery?page=full |title=The Right to Adultery? |publisher=Townhall.com |date=March 17, 2010 |accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanvalues.org/html/r-unhappy_ii.html |title=Does Divorce Make People Happy? Findings from a Study of Unhappy Marriages |publisher=Americanvalues.org |date=June 27, 1997 |accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallagher has written that "[w]e need a social institution, endowed with public authority, that teaches young men and women [...] that they need to come together in love to raise the children their bodies make together. If this is a core purpose of marriage, then same-sex unions are not marriages. If gay unions are marriages, then this is no longer what marriage is about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/633 | title=Economist Debates: Single-sex marriage | work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, Gallagher has written that same-sex marriage is "rooted in a false equation: Loving a man is not the same as loving a woman; a sexual union that can give rise to children is fundamentally different in kind than a union not so freighted, for good and for ill, with the fact of procreativity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Views on same-sex relationships===
In October 2006, Gallagher suggested to  gay rights groups that they stop promoting same-sex marriage and start vigorously advocating for civil unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://townhall.com/columnists/maggiegallagher/2006/10/24/state_marriage_amendment_and_gay_rights_new_dilemmas/page/full | title = State marriage amendment and gay rights: New dilemmas | author = Maggie Gallagher | work = Townhall | date = October 24, 2006 | accessdate = December 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, she expressed her support for certain kinds of civil unions for same-sex couples but not available for opposite-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/why-maggie-gallaghers-argument-against-same-sex-marriage-is-wrong/discrimination/2011/03/07/17853 | title = UPDATED: Why Maggie Gallagher’s Argument Against Same-Sex Marriage Is Wrong | author = David Badash  | work = The New Civil Rights movement | date = March 7, 2011 | accessdate = December 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she, in 2012, supported [[North Carolina Amendment 1|North Carolina's Amendment 1]], a state constitutional amendment that bans both recognition of same-sex marriages and civil unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://m.nationalreview.com/corner/299350/apologies-rod-sort-maggie-gallagher | title = Apologies to Rod (Sort Of) | author = Maggie Gallagher | work = National Review | date = May 8, 2012 | accessdate = December 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://m.nationalreview.com/corner/299350/apologies-rod-sort-maggie-gallagher | title = The Margin of Victory in North Carolina | author = Maggie Gallagher | work = National Review | date = May 9, 2012 | accessdate = December 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallagher believes that many people in the [[LGBT]] community, specifically gay men, choose to oppose what they label as the "[[heteronormative]]" constraints of a [[monogamy|monogamous relationship]], with reference to [[Eric Erbelding]]'s assertion that the married gay couples he knows are "for the most part monogamous, but for maybe a casual three-way".&lt;ref name=steve&gt;{{cite news|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/print/?q=ZGNmODNiMjI0MTQ1MTQwNGM4N2YyNmVhY2UyZTE0OWY= |title=Redefinition Revolution |publisher=''[[National Review]]'' |date=June 17, 2008 |accessdate=August 13, 2010 |first=Maggie |last=Gallagher |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629075454/http://article.nationalreview.com/print/?q=ZGNmODNiMjI0MTQ1MTQwNGM4N2YyNmVhY2UyZTE0OWY%3D |archivedate=June 29, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallagher had previously expressed opposition to [[domestic partnerships]] and [[civil unions]], and she believes that domestic partner benefits "erode the status" of heterosexual marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protectmaineequality.org/release.cfm?id=162|title=Yes Campaign Ad Promoting Domestic Partnerships a Sham|accessdate=August 13, 2010|publisher=protectmaineequality.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has stated that same-sex marriage is worse than polygamy, which/"for all its ugly defects, is an attempt to secure stable mother-father families for children."&lt;ref name=whymarriage /&gt;

Gallagher has stated that "[s]exual orientation is almost certainly unchosen", but that the decision to act on that desire and to incorporate it into one’s identity is a choice that bears moral reflection. She believes that "sexual desire is not its own justification" for acceptance or legal recognition of same-sex relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/395223/redefining-religious-liberty/maggie-gallagher |title=Redefining Religious Liberty |publisher=Article.nationalreview.com |date=May 27, 2009 |accessdate=February 27, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809220727/http://article.nationalreview.com/395223/redefining-religious-liberty/maggie-gallagher |archivedate=August 9, 2010 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also written that "once the principle [of same-sex marriage] is in the law, the next step will be to use the law to stigmatize, marginalize, and repress those who disagree with the government’s new views on marriage and sexual orientation." As an example, she has cited efforts by LGBT advocates to revoke the tax-exempt status of churches that oppose same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name=steve/&gt;

Gallagher has stated that she will not attend a same-sex wedding if she is ever invited to one.&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Gallagher (April 17, 2015) [http://www.nationalreview.com/article/417062/why-i-unlike-senator-rubio-would-not-attend-gay-wedding-maggie-gallagher Why I, Unlike Senator Rubio, Would Not Attend a Gay Wedding]. nationalreview.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on sex education===
Gallagher believes that teaching [[abstinence-only sex education|abstinence]] (encouraging celibacy until legally married) should be the sole curriculum. She does not believe in instructing students in birth control or how to prevent STDs through use of condoms or safe-sex techniques and has advocated discontinuing all safer-sex education in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallagher |first=Maggie |url=http://townhall.com/columnists/MaggieGallagher/2010/02/03/about_that_new_abstinence_study?page=full&amp;comments=true |title=About That New Abstinence Study (archived) |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=November 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209125714/http://townhall.com/columnists/MaggieGallagher/2010/02/03/about_that_new_abstinence_study?page=full&amp;comments=true |archivedate=February 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on single parenting===
When [[Dan Quayle]] criticized the fictional television character [[Murphy Brown]] for being an unwed mother, Gallagher wrote an op-ed for ''[[The New York Times]]'', "An Unwed Mother for Quayle", in his defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/marriage/mf0006.html |title=An Unwed Mother For Quayle |publisher=Catholiceducation.org |date= |accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential election===
Gallagher's endorsement of candidate [[Rick Santorum]] in the 2012 Republican presidential primaries was promoted by the Santorum campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0112/71435.html |title=Rick Santorum: Ron Paul doesn't stand for life – James Hohmann |publisher=Politico.Com |date= |accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bill Fox |url=http://data.greenvilleonline.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/13/former-chairman-of-the-national-organization-for-marriage-endorses/ |title=Former Chairman Of The National Organization For Marriage Endorses Santorum – Politics |publisher=Data.greenvilleonline.com |date=January 13, 2012 |accessdate=February 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717053844/http://data.greenvilleonline.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/13/former-chairman-of-the-national-organization-for-marriage-endorses/ |archivedate=July 17, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal contracts scandal==
Gallagher received tens of thousands of dollars from the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] during 2002 and 2003 for helping the [[George W. Bush administration]] promote the President's Healthy Marriage Initiative.&lt;ref name=Kurtz /&gt; Gallagher testified before Congress in favor of "healthy marriage" programs but never disclosed the payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washblade.com/2005/2-4/news/national/hrcseek.cfm |title=HRC seeks investigation of columnist Gallagher – Writer failed to disclose grants in congressional testimony |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422032717/http://www.washblade.com/2005/2-4/news/national/hrcseek.cfm |archivedate=April 22, 2009 |work=[[Washington Blade]] |date=February 4, 2005 |first=Joe |last=Crea}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about that situation, she replied, "Did I violate journalistic ethics by not disclosing it? I don't know. You tell me…frankly, it never occurred to me."&lt;ref name=Kurtz&gt;{{cite news

 | date = January 26, 2005
 | accessdate = March 25, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''[[The Washington Post]]'' revealed this information on January 26, 2005, Gallagher claimed significant differences between her situation and that of conservative columnist [[Armstrong Williams]]. She went on to add, "I should have disclosed a government contract when I later wrote about the Bush marriage initiative. I would have, if I had remembered it. My apologies to my readers."&lt;ref name="response"&gt;{{cite web |first=Maggie |last=Gallagher |year=2005 |title=A Question of Disclosure |url=http://www.uexpress.com/printable/print.html?uc_full_date=20050125&amp;uc_comic=mg |publisher=uexpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallagher received an additional $20,000 from the Bush administration for writing a report, titled ''Can Government Strengthen Marriage?'', for the National Fatherhood Initiative, a private organization.&lt;ref name="Kurtz" /&gt;

==Conversion therapy==

On a February 2012 edition of ''[[Up with Chris Hayes]]'' on which Gallagher appeared for a segment on the revival of the "culture wars", Gallagher was asked by ''[[The Nation]]'' editor Richard Kim about her support of [[conversion therapy|gay reparative therapy]]. Gallagher denied having ever supported ex-gay therapy and claimed that Kim was "making stuff up".&lt;ref name=Whitman&gt;{{cite news

 | accessdate = February 27, 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim subsequently quoted from a 2001 column written by Gallagher praising [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]] for his research on the possibilities of ex-gay therapy and calling on then-President [[George W. Bush]] to support federal funding for research into ex-gay therapy.&lt;ref name=Townhall&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, after blogging her support for [[Charles LiMandri|Chuck Limandri's]] representation of [[JONAH]] (a Jewish organization that offered support to persons with unwanted same-sex attraction),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/chuck-limandri-vs-splc-maggie-gallagher//|work=NationalReview.com|title=Chuck Limandri vs. the SPLC|last=Gallagher|first=Maggie|date=2013-07-15|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallagher made the following comments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/record-its-not-conversion-therapy-im-backing-maggie-gallagher/|work=NationalReview.com|title=For the Record: It’s Not Conversion Therapy I’m Backing|last=Gallagher|first=Maggie|date=2013-07-18|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding conversion therapy:
{{Quote
|text=I don’t back something called "conversion therapy."  I don’t even really know what conversion therapy is, and I’m not qualified to express an opinion on a particular kind of therapy.

I back the right of gay people to seek the kind of counseling help they want, not the kind the [Southern Poverty Law Center] lawyers want them to have, including help to live their sexual lives with integrity, according to their own values, not the SPLC’s values. That’s all.

A '''metroon''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Μητρῷον}}, ''Mētrō̂on'' or ''Mētrō̂ion'') was an [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[greek temple|temple]] dedicated to a [[mother goddess]]. They were often devoted to [[Cybele]], [[Demeter]], or [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]].

==Athens ==
[[Geographic coordinate system|Coordinates]]: {{coord|37.975214|N|23.722077|E|type:landmark_region:GR_scale:500|}}

The [[classical Athens|Athenian]] Metroon was located on the west side of the city's [[Athenian Agora|Agora]], in the [[Bouleuterion#Athens|Old Bouleuterion]] which formerly housed the [[boule (ancient Greece)|city council]]. At the end of the 5th century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, the [[New Bouleuterion]] was built and the council's former home converted into a temple to [[Cybele]]. Supposedly, the Athenians had killed one of her wandering priests when he attempted to introduce her cult; the plague which then visited the city was dealt with by honoring her. (The account may, however, have been a later invention, as the earliest source is from the 4th century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|ad}}.)&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian (emperor)|Julian]]. "Hymn to the Mother of the Gods". (362).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roller, 1999. pp. 162 - 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, in Lane, p.  258.&lt;/ref&gt; The Metroon continued to serve a public function, housing the official archives of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/athnlife/metroon.htm The Metrôon (Old Bouleuterion)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206100721/http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/athnlife/metroon.htm |date=2007-02-06 }} at ''Athenian Daily Life'', [[Brooklyn College]], [[City University of New York]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Olympia==
The [[Olympia, Greece|Olympian]] Metroon was erected in the late 4th or early 3rd century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} immediately below the terrace which housed the [[Treasuries at Olympia|Treasuries]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetware.com/olympia/olympia-metroon-gr-pel-metroo.htm Olympía - Metroon]&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious changes in the [[Albanian Orthodox Church|Albanian church]] occurred under the Arab rule, when the Catholicos Nerses I Bakur (688-704) attempted to convert to Chalcedonism, thus recognizing the spiritual authority of [[Constantinople]]. He was deposed by the Grand Duke of Albania Shero and other feudal lords who remained faithful to the Albanian church, and cursed at the national church cathedral. In the second half of the 10th century, the population of the left-bank Albania (Hereti) was included in the sphere of influence of the decision of the Chalcedon Council of the [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian Church]], adopted in the 7th century and got a great impact of Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sgW_HEcULMYC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=catholicosate+albania#v=onepage&amp;q=catholicosate%20albania&amp;f=false|title=From the Gulf to Central Asia: Players in the New Great Game|last=Ehteshami|first=Anoushiravan|date=1994|publisher=University of Exeter Press|isbn=9780859894517|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the territories of [[Transcaucasia]] entered the [[Russian Empire]], the Albanian Catholicos of the church in 1813 by the decree of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]] passed into the status of the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolite]] of the Albanian church.

Orthodoxy became wide spread in Azerbaijan at the beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://multiculturalism.preslib.az/en_a4.html|title=Azerbaijani Multiculturalism|last=Huseynzadeh|first=Tunjay|website=multiculturalism.preslib.az|language=en|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lib.aliyev-heritage.org/en/7855792.html|title=Welcome to Heydar Aliyevs Heritage Research Center|website=lib.aliyev-heritage.org|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orthodoxy in Azerbaijan nowadays ==
In 1815, the first Russian Orthodox church appeared in [[Baku]]. Later such churches were built in [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Goranboy (city)|Goranboy]] (Borisi-Russian village, 1842), [[Shamakhi|Shemakha]] (Alty-Aghadj village, 1834), [[Lankaran]] (Vel village, 1838), and [[Gadabay District|Gedabek]] (Slavyanka village, 1844).

There were 21 sectarian villages in Baku during 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azerbaijan.az/_GeneralInfo/_TraditionReligion/_traditionReligion_e.html|title=Azerbaijan - Religion In Azerbaijan|website=www.azerbaijan.az|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the Baku Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church was established. During the Soviet era,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/jil/articles/volume33/issue2/BlittBoyd33U.Pa.J.Int'lL.363(2011).pdf|title=Religion in USSR|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authorities repressed the priests of the Baku diocese, but in 1944 two churches were opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://myangle.net/en/angle/899-russian-orthodox-church-baku|title=Russian Orthodox Church in Baku|work=MyAngle|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the Baku-Caspian Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church was established. On March 22, 2011, the decision of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church was changed to the Baku-Caspian diocese in Baku-Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mospat.ru/en/2010/12/25/news33364/|title=Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church takes decisions on external church activities {{!}} The Russian Orthodox Church|website=mospat.ru|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 there were six Christian Orthodox churches in the country. Five of them belong to the Russian Orthodox church (ROC): three of them are located in Baku one in Ganja and one in [[Khachmaz (city)|Khachmaz]].

Another temple belongs to the jurisdiction of the Georgian Orthodox Church - the church of [[Saint George|St. George]] in the village of Gakh-Inguila in the [[Qakh District|Qakh district]], where the [[Ingiloy people|Ingiloi]] Georgians&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://matiane.wordpress.com/2010/08/16/activity-of-russian-orthodox-church-among-the-muslim-natives-of-the-caucasus-in-imperial-russia/|title=ACTIVITY OF RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH AMONG THE MUSLIM NATIVES OF THE CAUCASUS IN IMPERIAL RUSSIA|date=2010-08-16|work=მატიანე|access-date=2018-05-31|language=ka-GE}}&lt;/ref&gt; live compactly (about 7,500 people).

In 2013, November, President [[Ilham Aliyev]] participated in the opening ceremony of Orthodox Religious and Cultural Center of Baku and Azerbaijan Eparchy. Firstly&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; The President visited the [[Holy Myrrhbearers Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theorthodoxchurch.info/blog/news/azerbaijani-president-attends-opening-of-orthodox-religious-and-cultural-center-of-baku-and-azerbaijan-eparchy/|title=Azerbaijani President attends opening of Orthodox Religious and Cultural Center of Baku and Azerbaijan Eparchy|date=2013-11-16|work=News {{!}} Orthodoxy Cognate PAGE|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] Archangel’s Temple in the capital city Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archangel-mikhail-baku.com/en/about-us/|title=About us – Church of St. Archangel Michael of Baku|website=archangel-mikhail-baku.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Albanian-Udin Christian community ==
In 2001, during his visit to Azerbaijan, Patriarch Alexe II met with representatives of the Udin community who expressed the desire of their people to join the ROC. However, this did not lead to any real results, and the community of Udin remained outside the church's nourishment.

In May 28, 2003, the Albanian-Udin Christian community was established in Azerbaijan. The Chairman of the community was Robert Mobilea. This was due to the restoration of the ancient Kish temple in [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|Shaki]] (according to legend, the foundation was laid by the apostle Eliseus). In 2006, the restoration of the second Udin temple, the church in the village of Nijgabalinsky district, was completed. Restoration works are also continued in the village of Gum of the Gakh region and the basilica in the village of Gyumriuk with the intention of restoration of the Albanian basilica which is related to the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai113_folder/113_articles/113_udins_konanchev.html|title=Udins Today - Ancestors of the Caucasian Albanians|last=|first=|date=|website=www.azer.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the bishop of Baku and the Caspian Sea, Alexander (Ishchein), reported that Orthodox worship will be performed in Udin churches, and priests for them are trained in Russian religious schools. The Baku diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church took part in some solemn events, and even held baptisms, but there is no general progress on the involving of Udin into the ROC. Meanwhile, the Albanian-Udin Christian community exists in the form of a separate ethno-religious group with its own ideas about the "Udin Church", in which rituals are conducted not by canonical clergymen, but by the members of the community. In particular, the right to baptize was taken over by the Chairman of the AUHO Robert Mobilea and the self-styled "spiritual figure" Rafik Danakari.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baku.ru/blg-list.php?id=103190|title=Baptism in Nij|last=|first=|date=|website=www.baku.ru|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3211">'''Panhu''' (盤瓠 /{{IPA|pán hù}}/) is an important dog in [[Chinese mythology]]. The Panhu mythological complex includes myths in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and also other languages. This myth has a long history of being transmitted by [[Han Chinese]] and several of the other ethnic groups of the fifty-six officially recognized by the current administration of China, both orally and in literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://202.40.204.216/etext/chi/chi305/2002_3/pdf/chi305_0304.pdf 盤瓠與民族原推圖騰神話]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://202.40.204.216/etext/chi/chi305/2002_3/pdf/chi305_0302.pdf 盤瓠 ― 民族推源圖騰]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Yang 2005:4) The Panhu myth is an important origin myth for various ethnic groups.

==Basic myth==
The basic Panhu myth is about a dog (or dragon-dog) who transforms into a man and married a princess. The emperor of China in the course of losing a war which he was waging with a neighbor to the west, offered to marry his daughter to anybody that would present him with the head of his enemy. This was accomplished by the dog. Accounts vary, but eventually the dog and princess procreated copiously, producing many descendants.

==Variants==
There are also various variant versions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iel.cass.cn/news_show.asp?newsid=2045 盘瓠神话：楚与卢戎的一场战争·中国民族文学网]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmongbq.com/ReadNews.asp?NewsID=230 苗族民间祭祀制度 吴正彪]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.ln.edu.hk/etext/chi/chi305/2002_3/pdf/chi305_0304.pdf 葉曉文 盤瓠與民族原推圖騰神話]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.ln.edu.hk/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=chin_proj_1 盤瓠神話]&lt;/ref&gt; In some the dog became transformed into a human, except for his head. (Christie 1968: 121-122)

==Myth versus history==
In the study of historical Chinese culture, many of the stories that have been told regarding characters and events which have been written or told of the distant past have a double tradition: one which tradition which presents a more historicized and one which presents a more mythological version. (Yang 2005:12-13) This is also true in many of the accounts related to the Panhu.

==Religion==
Many of the myths regarding agriculture in China are related to popular religion and ritual. In modern times, Panhu has been worshipped by the [[Yao people]] and [[She people]] as "King Pan". (Yang 2005: 52-53).

'''Pergamea''' is a fictional settlement in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', the epic poem written by [[Virgil]] between 29 and 19 BC.

Pergamea is the name of the city that [[Aeneas]] and his crew began to found on the island of [[Crete]]. In [[Delos]], [[Apollo]] had delivered them an oracle telling them that they would found a new city in their homeland.

Aeneas and his men had misinterpreted this to mean Crete, but the oracle had meant [[Italy]]. When they began to build the city, they were struck down with disease. Apollo appeared to Aeneas in a dream and told him that they were at the wrong place and that they should push on to Italy.&lt;ref name=Aeneid&gt;''Aeneid'' Book III, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng''' ({{lang-vi|Vườn quốc gia Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng}}) is a [[national park]] and [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in the [[Bố Trạch District|Bố Trạch]] and [[Minh Hóa District|Minh Hóa]] districts of central [[Quảng Bình Province]] in the [[North Central Coast]] region of [[Vietnam]], about 500&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Hanoi]]. The park borders the [[Hin Namno Nature Reserve]] in [[Khammouane Province]], [[Laos]] to the west and 42&amp;nbsp;km east of the [[South China Sea]] from its borderline point. Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng National Park is situated in a limestone zone of 2,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in Vietnamese territory and borders another limestone zone of 2,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of Hin Namno in Laotian territory. The core zone of this national park covers 857.54&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a buffer zone of 1,954&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="unep-wcmc"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park|url=http://www.unep-wcmc.org/sites/wh/Phong_nha.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115021650/http://www.unep-wcmc.org/sites/wh/Phong_nha.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-11-15|publisher=[[United Nations Environment Programme]]|date=March 2003|accessdate=2008-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park was created to protect one of the world's two largest [[Karst topography|karst]] regions with 300 caves and [[grotto]]es and also protects the [[ecosystem]] of [[limestone]] forest of the [[Annamite Range]] region in [[North Central Coast]] of Vietnam.&lt;ref name="uhc.unesco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/951rev.pdf|title=World Heritage Nomination, IUCN Technical Evaluation; Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng National Park, pgs. 53-55|work=[[IUCN]]|accessdate=28 February 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dgmv"&gt;{{cite web|title=Di sản thiên nhiên thế giới - Vườn quốc gia Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng (Quảng Bình)|url=http://www.idm.gov.vn/Nguon_luc/Xuat_ban/Anpham/Phongnha/T189.htm|publisher=[[Politics of Vietnam|Vietnam Geological and Mineral Resources Department]]|date=2006-07-23|accessdate=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng is noted for its cave and grotto systems as it is composed of 300 caves and grottos. A 2009 survey brought the total discovered length of the cave system to about 126&amp;nbsp;km,&lt;ref name="DT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dantri.com.vn/c20/s20-320853/phat-hien-hang-dong-lon-nhat-the-gioi-tai-quang-binh.htm|title=World's largest cave found in Quang Binh|work=Dân Trí|date=2009-04-23|accessdate=2009-05-08|language=Vietnamese}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many areas still not well explored. The [[Sơn Đoòng Cave]], which was discovered in the 2009 survey by British and Vietnamese explorers, is considered the largest cave in the world. Even before this discovery, Phong Nha held several world cave records, including the longest river as well as the largest combined caverns and passageways.&lt;ref name="unep-wcmc"/&gt;

The park derives its name from [[Phong Nha Cave]], containing many fascinating rock formations, and Kẻ Bàng forest.&lt;ref name="peacetourco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacetourco.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;Itemid=158&amp;id=68&amp;lang=en|title=Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park in central Quang Binh|publisher=Peacetourco|accessdate=2008-02-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211055018/http://www.peacetourco.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;Itemid=158&amp;id=68&amp;lang=en|archivedate=2008-12-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plateau on which the park is situated is probably one of the finest and most distinctive examples of a complex karst landform in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/951|title=Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2003|accessdate=2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This national park was listed in [[UNESCO]]'s World Heritage Sites in 2003 for its geological values as defined in its criteria viii.&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt; In April 2009, the world's [[Sơn Đoòng Cave|largest cave]], was re-discovered by a team of British cave explorers of the [[British Caving Association]] led by a local farmer named Ho Khanh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1175430/British-explorers-discover-worlds-largest-cave-deep-Vietnamese-jungle.html|title=British explorers discover the light at the end of the tunnel ... in the world's largest cave|date=2009-05-05|accessdate=2009-05-05|publisher=MailOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sondoongcave.org/news/Ho-Khanh-a-local-farmer-and-biggest-cave-in-the-world-3.html|title = Ho Khanh, a local farmer and biggest cave in the world|date = 2009-06-29|accessdate = 2014-11-12|website = Son Doong Cave|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of exploration==
[[Champa]] inscriptions carved on [[stele]]s and altars in the cave demonstrate that people had inhabited the cave long before the area was annexed by Vietnam in the [[Nam tiến]] or southward expansion. In 1550, [[Dương Văn An]] was the first Vietnamese man to write about Phong Nha cave. This cave was depicted in [[Nine Urns (Huế)|9 urns]] in the Citadel of the [[Nguyễn Dynasty]] in [[Huế]].&lt;ref name="unep-wcmc"/&gt; In 1824, The cave was conferred the title "Diệu ứng chi thần" ({{linktext|妙|應|之|神}}) by King [[Minh Mạng]]. It was also conferred by Nguyen kings as "Thần Hiển Linh" ({{linktext|神|顯|靈}}).&lt;ref name="dainamnhatthongchi"/&gt;

In the late 19th century, [[Léopold Michel Cadière]], a French Roman Catholic priest, conducted an expedition to explore [https://web.archive.org/web/20150518095354/http://chuyendedulich.com/dua-thuyen-bang-rung-nguyen-sinh-phong-nha-de-lam-tu-thien/ Phong Nha] cave, where he discovered Champa scripts. He proclaimed Phong Nha cave "The number one cave of Indochina".&lt;ref name="dgmv"/&gt; In July 1924, an English expeditionist (surnamed Barton) stated that Phong Nha cave is second to none of famous caves of [[Padirac]] (France), [[Cuevas del Drach]] (Spain).&lt;ref name="unep-wcmc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nea"/&gt; In 1935, a local inhabitant accidentally discovered a beautiful cave 1&amp;nbsp;km from the mouth of Phong Nha cave, at an elevation of 200 meters. It was called Tien Son cave (lit.: ''Fairy-tale cave''), or Dry cave because its inside landscape is similar to fairy-tales and it has no underground river.&lt;ref name="dattroivietnam"/&gt;

In 1937, the Bureau of Tourism of [[French Resident Superior]] (in [[Huế]]) issued a brochure to introduce tourism in Quảng Bình and [[Phong Nha Cave]] was included in this introduction. This tour site is ranked second in [[French Indochina]]. Before 1990, several explorations were conducted by Vietnamese and foreign groups but the mystery of this area still remained. From 1990 on, there marked a turning point in discovering activities, from exploration to research, thus full documents for submission to UNESCO for World Natural Heritage nomination were made available.
[[File:Phongnhacave.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Inside Tien Son cave]]
IN 1990, for the first time, [[Vietnam National University, Hanoi|Hanoi University]] accepted the cooperation proposal of the [[British Cave Research Association]]. They combined efforts in exploring and researching caves and grottoes in the area comprehensively. The first exploration was conducted in 1990 by a group from the British Cave Research Association and Faculty for Geology and Geography of [[Hanoi University]], led by Howard Limbert. They completed research of a large part of Vom Cave. In 1992, the second exploration was conducted by a group of 12 British scientists, six professors from Hanoi University. This time, this group completed their exploration of 7,729 m of [[Phong Nha Cave]] and 13,690 m of Vom Cave and adjacent caves and grottos. In 1994, a third exploration was carried out by a group of 11 British scientists and five Vietnamese professors of Hanoi University. In 1999 scientists from the [[Vietnam-Russia Tropical Centre]] also conducted zoological and botanical surveys in the Kẻ Bàng area.&lt;ref name="unep-wcmc"/&gt; Based on the results of these three explorations, more information about the caves and grottoes made available to the Vietnamese and local government for the protection, planning, and tourism development of this park.&lt;ref name="dgmv"/&gt;

In 2005, scientists from the British Cave Research Association discovered a new cave and named it '''Paradise Cave''' (''động Thiên Đường''). The newly discovered cave was acclaimed by the British scientists as "the largest and the most beautiful cave in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng area".&lt;ref name="vietnamopentour"&gt;{{cite web|title=Khám phá động Thiên Đường (Discover the Paradise Cave) |url=http://www.vietnamopentour.com.vn/cms/articles/809/1/%20Kham-pha-dong-Thien-Duong |accessdate=2008-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211165005/http://www.vietnamopentour.com.vn/cms/articles/809/1/%20Kham-pha-dong-Thien-Duong |archivedate=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vietbao19-7-05"&gt;{{cite web|title=Phát hiện hang động lớn nhất tại Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng (Largest cave found in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng)|url=http://vietbao.vn/Khoa-hoc/Phat-hien-hang-dong-lon-nhat-tai-Phong-Nha-Ke-Bang/10918592/188|date=2005-07-19|accessdate=2008-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2006, the Ministry of Culture and Information of Vietnam issued a stamp collection of depicting various landscapes found in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng.&lt;ref name="xahoithongtin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Phát hành bộ tem "Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng" (Collection of Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng stamp issued)|url=http://www.xahoithongtin.com.vn/index.asp?ID=55&amp;subjectID=8345|date=2006-06-19|accessdate=2008-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, a group of cave explorers from [[British Caving Association]] conducted survey in this park and adjacent areas. The biggest chamber of Sơn Đoòng is more than five (5) kilometers in length, 200 meters high and 150 meters wide. With these dimensions, Sơn Đoòng overtakes [[Deer Cave]] in [[Malaysia]] to take the title of the world's largest cave. At the same time they found new caves and grottoes in the park and adjacent area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lookatvietnam.com/2009/04/worlds-largest-grotto-unveiled-in-vietnam.html |title=World's largest grotto unveiled in Vietnam |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427083214/http://www.lookatvietnam.com/2009/04/worlds-largest-grotto-unveiled-in-vietnam.html |archivedate=2009-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/vietnam/5251243/Britons-claim-to-find-worlds-largest-cave.html Britons claim to find world's largest cave], ''Daily Telegraph'', 1 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeenews.com/news528161.html|title=World's largest cave found|publisher=Zennews|accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this survey, the cave British explorers discovered 20 new caves with total length of 56&amp;nbsp;km, including world's largest cave, Sơn Đoòng.&lt;ref name="DT"/&gt;

==Geography==

===Location===
[[File:Phong Nha-Ke Bang cave3.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Inside Phong Nha Cave]]
Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng National Park is located in the territories of communes (Vietnamese: ''xã''): Tan Trach, Thuong Trach, Phuc Trach, Xuan Trach and Son Trach of [[Bố Trạch District]] and a small part of [[Minh Hóa District]] in the center of [[Quảng Bình Province]], around 40&amp;nbsp;km north-west of the provincial capital city of [[Đồng Hới]]. The park is bordered by the [[Hin Namno]] karst area of [[Khammouane Province]] of [[Laos]] in the west. Road distances are about 500&amp;nbsp;km south of the capital [[Hanoi]] and 260&amp;nbsp;km north of the port city of [[Da Nang|Đà Nẵng]]. The [[Geographic coordinate system|geographical coordinates]] are {{coord|17|32|14|N|106|9|4.5|E}}.&lt;ref name="nea"&gt;{{cite web|title=Decision by the Vietnamese Prime Minister on establishment of Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park|url=http://www.nea.gov.vn/luat/toanvan/QD_189-2001_QD-TTg.htm|publisher=nea.gov|date=12 December 2001|accessdate=24 February 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122015357/http://www.nea.gov.vn/luat/toanvan/QD_189-2001_QD-TTg.htm|archivedate=22 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park is situated around 30&amp;nbsp;km west of the [[South China Sea]] and [[National Route 1A (Vietnam)|National Route 1A]], near [[Ho Chi Minh Highway|Hồ Chí Minh Highway]] and 28&amp;nbsp;km west of the [[North–South Railway (Vietnam)|Hanoi–Saigon Railway]], and is accessible by road or waterway through an estuary in the [[South China Sea]]. There is a small airport near the park accessible by helicopter or small aircraft (Khe Gat Airbase), an airbase used by the North Vietnamese Air Force during the [[Vietnam War]], notably in the [[Battle of Đồng Hới]].

===Park layout===
Before becoming a national park, this area had been a nature reserve. The Phong Nha Nature Reserve with an area of 50&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; was officially declared by the Vietnamese government on 9 August 1986 and was extended to 411.32&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by 1991. On 12 December 2001, the Vietnamese Prime Minister by Decision 189/2001 189/2001/QĐ-TTG turning then a nature reserve into a national park. The purpose of this protected area is to protect forest resources, biodiversity within the boundary of this national park and to preserve scientific values of fauna and flora in [[Bắc Trung Bộ]] region, especially rare species native to this region. The park covers a total area of 857.54&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which are divided into three zones, a "strictly protected zone" (648.94&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), an "ecological recovery zone" (174.49&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and an "administrative service zone" (34.11&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="nea"/&gt;

===Climate===
Like [[North Central Coast]] in general, and [[Quảng Bình Province]] in particular, the climate in Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng national park is tropically hot and humid. The annual mean temperature is 23-25&amp;nbsp;°C (73-77&amp;nbsp;°F), with a maximum of 41&amp;nbsp;°C (106&amp;nbsp;°F) in the summer and a minimum of 6&amp;nbsp;°C (43&amp;nbsp;°F) in the winter. The hottest months in this region fall from June to August, with an average temperature of 28&amp;nbsp;°C (82&amp;nbsp;°F), and the coldest months from December to February with an average temperature of 18&amp;nbsp;°C (64&amp;nbsp;°F). Annual rainfall is about 2,000&amp;nbsp;mm to 2,500&amp;nbsp;mm (80-100&amp;nbsp;in). 88% of the rainfall falls during the monsoon, from July to December, however, there is more than 160 rainy days per year, and some rain still falls throughout the dry season. Mean annual relative humidity is 84%.&lt;ref name="unep-wcmc"/&gt;

==Geology==

===History of formation===
The Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng karst has evolved since the [[Paleozoic]] (some 400 million years ago), making it the oldest major [[karst]] area in Asia. It has been subject to massive tectonic changes, and comprises a multitude of rock types that are interbedded in complex ways. As many as seven different major levels of karst development have occurred as a result of tectonic uplift and changing sea levels, thus the karst landscape of PNKB is extremely complex with high geodiversity and many geomorphic features of considerable significance. There is also strong evidence that sulphurous solution and hydrothermal action have played an important role in shaping the broad-scale landscape and the caves, though this has not yet been properly assessed.&lt;ref name="uhc.unesco"/&gt; The Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng area today is the result of five stages of Earth's crust development and movement:&lt;ref name="dgmv"/&gt;
* Late Ordovician - Early Silurian Stage (about 450 Ma)
* Middle-late Devonian Stage (about 340 Ma)
* Carboniferous-Permian (about 300 Ma)
* Mesozoic Orogenic stage
* Cenozoic stage.

===Geological significance===
Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park is one of the world's two largest [[limestone]] regions. In comparison with 41 other world heritage sites which have [[karst]]s, Phong Nha has dissimilar geomorphic, geologic and biotic conditions. The karsts of Phong Nha can be traced back to [[Paleozoic|Palaeozoic]] era, 400 million years ago. This makes Phong Nha the oldest major karst in Asia. If the [[Hin Namno]], bordering Phong Nha on the west (in [[Laos|Laotian]] territory) was to be combined with the national park in a continuous reserve, the combined reserve would be the largest surviving karst forest in southeastern Asia (317,754 ha).

In general, there are two groups of landforms in the Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng area, namely non-karstic and karstic landforms. Non-karstic landforms includes three types: The middle and low dome-block mountains developed in intrusive magmatic massifs; The middle denudation-structural mountain belts developed in terrigenous rocks of Cretaceous age; and The low block-denudational mountain belts developed in other terrigenous rocks. Karstic landforms in this area are of typical tropical karst which are divided into two groups of forms: The karstic forms on the surface including cone and tower karst, karrens, valleys and dolines, border polje, etc.; The underground karst consisting of caves.&lt;ref name="dgmv"/&gt;

In comparison with three other national parks listed in UNESCO's World Heritage Sites in Southeast Asia, namely [[Gunung Mulu National Park]] in [[Malaysia]], [[Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park]] in [[Palawan]] of the [[Philippines]] and [[Lorentz National Park]] in [[Western New Guinea|West Irian]] of [[Indonesia]] and some other karst regions in [[Thailand]], China, [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Karst topography|karst]] in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng is older, has more complicated geological structure; diverse and complex underground rivers.&lt;ref name="uhc.unesco"/&gt;

===Mounts and summits===
Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng contains two dozens of mountain peaks with over 1,000&amp;nbsp;metres in height. Noteworthy peaks are the Peak Co Rilata with a height of 1,128 m and the Peak Co Preu with a height of 1,213 m.&lt;ref name="unep-wcmc"&gt;[http://www.unep-wcmc.org/sites/wh/Phong_nha.html United Nations Environment Programme, World Conservation Monitoring Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; Mounts in [[Karst topography|karstic]] area of the park rise at typical height of above 800&amp;nbsp;m constitute a continuous range along Laotian-Vietnamese borderline, of which notable summits above 1000&amp;nbsp;m are: Phu Tạo (1174&amp;nbsp;m), Co Unet (1150&amp;nbsp;m), Phu Canh (1095&amp;nbsp;m), Phu Mun (1078&amp;nbsp;m), Phu Tu En (1078&amp;nbsp;m), Phu On Chinh (1068&amp;nbsp;m), Phu Dung (1064&amp;nbsp;m), Phu Tu Ôc (1053&amp;nbsp;m), Phu Long (1015&amp;nbsp;m), Phu Ôc (1015&amp;nbsp;m), Phu Dong (1002&amp;nbsp;m). Inserting into these summits are 800–1000&amp;nbsp;m high summits of Phu Sinh (965&amp;nbsp;m), Phu Co Tri (949&amp;nbsp;m), Phu On Boi (933&amp;nbsp;m), Phu Tu (956&amp;nbsp;m), Phu Toan (905&amp;nbsp;m), Phu Phong (902&amp;nbsp;m) and núi Ma Ma (835&amp;nbsp;m).

Non-[[Karst topography|karstic]] topographical area accounts for a low percentage, distributing mainly in outer circle of limestone in the north, northeast and southeast of this national park. The height of these summits varies from 500-1000 &amp;nbsp;m with the deep divisions and high sloping level from 25-30°. There are some narrow valleys along streams such as Am creek, Cha Lo creek, Chua Ngút creek and a valley along Rao Thuong river in the southernmost edge. In the north-south direction, there exists notable summits: Phu Toc Vu (1000&amp;nbsp;m), Mã Tác (1068&amp;nbsp;m), Cổ Khu (886&amp;nbsp;m), U Bò (1009&amp;nbsp;m), Co Rilata (1128&amp;nbsp;m); The highest summit in the non-karstic area and also the highest summt of this national park is Co Preu (1213&amp;nbsp;m), a summit in the southernmost edge of the park.&lt;ref name="dgmv"/&gt;

===Rivers and streams===
[[File:Phongnhakebang1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Son River in the Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park]]
[[File:Phong Nha cave entrance.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Underground river in Phong Nha cave]]
Besides the grotto and cave systems, Phong Nha has the longest underground river. The [[Son River (Vietnam)|Sơn]] and [[Chay River|Chay]] are the main rivers in this national park. Most of caves here have been shaped by Son and Chay Rivers. The Son River flows into the mouth of the Phong Nha cave and keeps on underground, where it is called the Nam Aki River. It emerges 20&amp;nbsp;km to the south near Pu-Pha-Dam Mountain.&lt;ref name="traveltovietnam"/&gt; There are spectacular streams, springs and waterfalls in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng, namely: Gió waterfall, Madame Loan waterfall, Mọc stream erupting from a limestone mount range, and Trạ Ang stream.&lt;ref name="Tuổi Trẻ 25-1-2008"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tuoitre.com.vn/Tianyon/Index.aspx?ArticleID=240340&amp;ChannelID=481|title=Phát hiện mới ở Phong Nha|work=[[Tuổi Trẻ]]|date=2008-01-25|accessdate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cave and grottos==
Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng is home to the largest cave in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/Culture_Art/2009/4/70283/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427155306/http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/Culture_Art/2009/4/70283/ |archivedate=2009-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and covers 300 different grottoes and caves. Before [[Sơn Đoòng Cave]] was found, [[Phong Nha Cave]] was regarded by British Caving Association as the top cave in the world due to its top four records: the longest underground river, the highest and longest cave, broadest and most beautiful fine sand beaches inside the caves, and the most spectacular stalagmites and stalactites.&lt;ref name="peacetourco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ngaynay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngaynay.com.vn/index.php?id=427&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view|title=Di sản thiên nhiên Phong Nha Kẻ Bàng|publisher=Peacetourco|accessdate=2008-02-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228162036/http://ngaynay.com.vn/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=427|archivedate=2008-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mientrung"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mientrung.com/content/view/160/129|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112160426/http://www.mientrung.com/content/view/160/129/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-11-12|title=Bảy cái nhất của động Phong Nha cần khám phá trong hè này|publisher=Peacetourco|date=2004-06-01|accessdate=2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the survey conducted in April 2009, the British cave explorers discovered 20 new caves with total length of 56&amp;nbsp;km, including world's largest cave Son Doong.&lt;ref name="DT"/&gt; According to the assessment of [[UNESCO]], "The karst formation of Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park has evolved since the Palaeozoic (some 400 million years ago) and so is the oldest major karst area in Asia" and "Phong Nha displays an impressive amount of evidence of earth's history. It is a site of very great importance for increasing our understanding of the geologic, geomorphic and geo-chronological history of the region."&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;

===Etymology===
The name ''Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng'' is composed of ''Phong Nha'' (cave) and ''Kẻ Bàng'' (limestone forest). Phong Nha is widely explained as originating from [[Hán Nôm]] [[wikt:风|风]] [[wikt:牙|牙]], which means wind-tooth (wind flowing from the cave and [[stalactite]]s and [[stalagmite]]s inside the cave looking like teeth).&lt;ref name="wil-travel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wil-travel.com/vn/dlphongnha.php|title=Phong Nha|publisher=wil.travel|accessdate=2008-02-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212025314/http://www.wil-travel.com/vn/dlphongnha.php|archivedate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanoitourism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wil-travel.com/vn/dlphongnha.php|title=BIỂN NHẬT LỆ - PHONG NHA KẺ BÀNG - TIÊN SƠN ĐÁ NHẢY|publisher=Hanoitourism|accessdate=2008-02-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212025314/http://www.wil-travel.com/vn/dlphongnha.php|archivedate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possibility is that Phong Nha, unrelated to the meanings ''wind'' and ''teeth'', was the former name of a nearby village.&lt;ref name="dgmv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nguoiquangbinh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nguoiquangbinh.net/forum/diendan/archive/index.php?t-3466.html|title=Tên gọi Phong Nha từ đâu? Và Phong Nha nghĩa là gì?|publisher=nguoiquangbinh|date=2007-03-13|accessdate=2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Phủ biên tạp lục]] by [[Lê Quý Đôn]] was written in 1776&lt;/ref&gt;

A third hypothesis suggests that Phong Nha derived its name from the imagination that mounts in this region standing in line looks similar to the scene of mandarins in front of the king in royal courts, therefore, it was named Phong Nha. ''Phong'' ([[wikt:峰|峰]]) means "summit" and ''nha'' ([[wikt:衙|衙]]) means "mandarin".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toquoc.gov.vn/vietnam/viewNew.asp?newsId=3131&amp;zoneId=1 Đi tìm ý nghĩa Phong Nha] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080212091248/http://www.toquoc.gov.vn/vietnam/viewNew.asp?newsId=3131&amp;zoneId=1 |date=2008-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Other names for the Phong Nha cave include: '''Thầy Tiên cave''', '''Thầy Mount''', and '''Troóc cave'''.&lt;ref name="dainamnhatthongchi"&gt;''[[Đại Nam nhất thống chí]]'' by the Nguyễn Dynasty's bureau of history records&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Phong Nha Cave===
[[File:Phongnhakebang2.jpg|thumb|The mouth of Phong Nha cave with underground river]]
This cave, from which the name to the whole system and the park is derived, is famous for its rock formations which have been given names such as the "Lion", the "Fairy Caves", the "Royal Court", and the "[[Buddharupa|Buddha]]". This cave is 7729 m long, contains 14 grottos, with a 13,969 m-long underground river. The scientists have surveyed 44.5&amp;nbsp;km of grottos in this cave so far, but tourists can only penetrate to a distance of 1500 m.&lt;ref name="unep-wcmc"/&gt;

[[Phong Nha Cave]], like most of the caves in this area, has been continuously shaped by the Chay River. As one gets farther into the cave, the more illusory the stalactites and stalagmites look as they glitter when bright light is shone on them. The Son River flows into the mouth of the cave and keeps flowing underground, where it is referred to as the Nam Aki River, then this river emerges at a site 20&amp;nbsp;km to the south near Pu Pha Dam Mountain. The main Phong Nha cave includes 14 chambers, connected by an underwater river that runs for 1.5&amp;nbsp;km. Secondary corridors branch off in all directions. The Outer Cave and some of the Inner Caves have roofs that tower between 25 and 40 meters above the water level. From the 14th chamber there may be other corridors leading to similarly large chambers, but this area proves more dangerous for explorers because of the ongoing erosion of the limestone of the cavern. The Shallow Cave is located 800 meters from the cave mouth, where there is a spectacular landscape of sand and rock. Stalactites and stalagmites jut out like strange trees, exciting visitor's imaginations.&lt;ref name="traveltovietnam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wil-travel.com/vn/dlphongnha.php|title=Phong Nha Cave|publisher=Traveltovietnam|accessdate=2008-02-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212025314/http://www.wil-travel.com/vn/dlphongnha.php|archivedate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tiên Sơn Cave===
[[File:Tiên Sơn cave - ZooKeys-071-001-g002.jpeg|thumb|Tiên Sơn cave]]
Tiên Sơn cave is located in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park. The cave was discovered by a local inhabitant by accident in 1935.&lt;ref name="dattroivietnam"&gt;Đất trời Việt Nam by Thái Văn Kiểm&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in Sơn Trach Commune in [[Bố Trạch District|Bố Trạch]]. The entry mouth of Tiên Sơn is 1&amp;nbsp;km from Phong Nha cave, at an altitude of 200 m. This cave is 980 m in length. A 10 m deep hole is situated 400 m from the entry mouth, then a 500 m long cave, dangerous for tourists and open to professional expeditionists only. Like Phong Nha cave, this cave features spectacular stalactites and stalagmites shaped like several fairy-tales. Stalactite and stalagmite columns and walls here create strange sounds like that of gong and drum if they are knocked with the hand. According to British cave scientists, Tiên Sơn cave was created tens of million years ago when a water current holed this limestone mount in Kẻ Bàng. Following a series of landforms and movement of rocks, this mass was levered or lowered, blocking the current and creating what is now Tiên Sơn cave while the underground river redirected its current to Phong Nha cave. Although Phong Nha and Tiên Sơn caves are located next to each other, there are no linking grottos between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bauchon.tuoitre.com.vn/Tianyon/Index.aspx?ArticleID=241910&amp;ChannelID=458 |title=Kỳ vĩ động Tiên Sơn |work=[[Tuổi Trẻ]] |date=2008-02-07 |accessdate=2008-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207094551/http://bauchon.tuoitre.com.vn/Tianyon/Index.aspx?ArticleID=241910&amp;ChannelID=458 |archivedate=February 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thiên Đường Cave===
[[File:ThienDuongCave1.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Thiên Đường Cave]]
[[Thiên Đường Cave|Thiên Đường "Paradise" Cave]] is a newly found cave in this area. Prior to the discovery of Sơn Đoòng cave, it was regarded as the largest and longest cave in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng. Some of the most beautiful and spectacular [[stalactite]]s and [[stalagmite]]s in the park are found within Thiên Đường. The cave was discovered by a local man in 2005. The first 5&amp;nbsp;km of this cave was explored by explorers from the [[British Cave Research Association]] in 2005; later they in 2010 the whole 31&amp;nbsp;km was explored and announced by the association.

At 31&amp;nbsp;km long, Thiên Đường cave is longer than Phong Nha cave, previously considered the longest cave in this [[national park]]. The height can reach to 100 m and 150 wide. The limestone formation is also more spectacular than that of Phong Nha Cave. The British cave explorers was impressed by the beauty of the rock formation inside the cave, they named it "Paradise Cave" (''Thiên Đường'' in Vietnamese).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.www.info.vn/explore-vietnam/travel-news/4402-paradise-cave-found-to-be-31km-long-says-british-explorer-.html|title=Paradise Cave found to be 31km long, says British explorer|publisher=info.vn|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804072326/http://en.www.info.vn/explore-vietnam/travel-news/4402-paradise-cave-found-to-be-31km-long-says-british-explorer-.html|archivedate=2011-08-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khoahoc.com.vn/doisong/moi-truong/thien-nhien/28089_Hang-dong-Thien-Duong-pha-ky-luc-ve-do-dai.aspx|title=Hang động Thiên Đường phá kỷ lục về độ dài|publisher=Khoa hoc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access road and tourist facilities was built by Truong Thinh Group, it was opened up to tourists on 3 September 2010 with a 1.1&amp;nbsp;km path to see the formations.&lt;ref name="tuoitre27-2-08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuoitre.com.vn/Tianyon/Index.aspx?ArticleID=244774&amp;ChannelID=481|title=Động Thiên Đường "Hoàng cung" trong lòng đất (Paradise Cave – an "underground royal palace")|work=[[Tuổi Trẻ]]|date=27 February 2008|accessdate=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sơn Đoòng Cave===
{{main|Sơn Đoòng Cave}}
[[Sơn Đoòng Cave]] (in Vietnamese: Hang Sơn Đoòng, meaning Mountain River Cave) is a relatively recently discovered cave in the national park. Found by a local man and explored and publicly announced by the British cave scientists of the [[British Cave Research Association]], it is regarded as the largest cave in the world.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090426043332/http://vietnewsonline.vn/News/Society/5914/Explorers-find-worlds-largest-cave-in-Vietnam.htm Explorers find world's largest cave in Vietnam], ''[[Vietnews]]'', 23 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest chamber of Sơn Đoòng is over five kilometers in length, 200 meters high and 150 meters wide.

The cave was found by a man named Hồ Khanh in 1991. The local jungle men were afraid of the cave for the whistling sound it makes from the [[underground river]]. However, not until 2009 was it made known to the public when a group of British scientists from the [[British Cave Research Association]], led by Howard and Deb Limbert, conducted a survey in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng from 10–14 April 2009.&lt;ref name="YahooExplorersDiscover"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dykes|first=Brett Michael|title=Explorers discover spectacular caves in Vietnam|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_thelookout/20110103/ts_yblog_thelookout/explorers-discover-spectacular-caves-in-vietnam|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|accessdate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their progress was stopped by a large [[calcite]] wall.&lt;ref name="YahooExplorersDiscover"/&gt;

According to the Limberts, this cave is five times larger than the [[Phong Nha Cave]], previously considered the biggest cave in Vietnam. The biggest chamber of Sơn Đoòng is over five kilometers in length, 200 meters high and 150 meters wide. With these dimensions, Sơn Đoòng overtook [[Deer Cave]] in [[Malaysia]] to take the title of the world's largest cave.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lookatvietnam.com/2009/04/worlds-largest-grotto-unveiled-in-vietnam.html |title=World’s largest grotto unveiled in Vietnam |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427083214/http://www.lookatvietnam.com/2009/04/worlds-largest-grotto-unveiled-in-vietnam.html |archivedate=2009-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/07/090724-biggest-cave-vietnam "World's Biggest Cave Found in Vietnam"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106030746/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/07/090724-biggest-cave-vietnam |date=2011-01-06 }}, ''National Geographic'', 3.1.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruc Mon Cave===
{{main|Ruc Mon Cave}}
Ruc Mon Cave, named after the indigenous people who made a home at the entrance until the 80s, was discovered in 2016 by a local man. The cave is 17km in length, with one entrance in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park and the other at the border of [[Laos]]. This cave has the potential to be the second biggest cave in the world, following the first biggest cave also located in a Phong Nha. In 2017, the first tourists explored the cave, guided by the man who found it. One of over 300 caves in Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park, this cave is probably the least-explored of the many caves open to tourists. Greenland Tour company is the only company that offers access to the cave. The tours are led by the man who discovered the cave.

==Biodiversity in the park==

===Florae===
[[File:Phongnhakebang11.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Trees on the limestone mounts, a typical florae in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park]]
The park is part of the [[Annamite Range|Annamites]] eco-region. By far the largest vegetation type is tropical dense moist evergreen forest on limestone under 800 m above sea level. 96.2% of this national park is covered with forest, 92.2% of which is intact primary forest. 74.7% (1104.76&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of the park is covered with evergreen tropical wet forest on limestone rocks at the elevation of under 800 m; 8.5% (126&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is evergreen tropical wet forest on limestone rocks at an elevation higher than 800 m; 8.3% (122.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) evergreen tropical wet forest on soil mounts at the elevation of under 800 m; evergreen tropical wet forest on limestone rocks at the elevation of under 800 m; 0.7% (10.7&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) evergreen tropical wet forest on limestone rocks at the elevation of above 800; 1.1% impacted evergreen tropical wet forest on limestone rocks; 2.8% (42.12&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) impacted evergreen tropical wet forest on soil mounts; 1.3% (1,925) grass, bush on limestone rocks; 2% (29.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) grass, bush on soil mounts; permanent wetland forest: 1.8&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; rattan and bamboo forest: 1.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; and agricultural plants: 5.21&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 0.3%.&lt;ref name="dgmv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eoearth"&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Phong_Nha-Ke_Bang_National_Park,_Vietnam The Encyclopedia Earth]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the results of initial surveys, the primary tropical forest in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng consists of 140 families, 427 genera, and 751 species of vascular plants, of which 36 species are endangered and listed in the [[Vietnam's Red Data Book]].

The most common tree species in this park are ''[[Hopea sp.]]'', ''[[Sumbaviopsis albicans]]'', ''[[Garcinia fragraeoides]]'', ''[[Burretionendron hsienmu]]'', ''[[Chukrasia tabularis]]'', ''[[Photinia aroboreum]]'' and ''[[Dysospyros saletti]]''. Seedlings can only grow in holes and cracks in the limestone where soil has accumulated, so in general regeneration after disturbance is slow. The forest type in this national park is dominated by [[evergreen]] tree species with scattered deciduous trees such as ''[[Dipterocarpus kerri]]'', ''[[Anogeissus acuminate]]'', ''[[Pometia pinnata]]'' and ''[[Lagerstroemia calyculata]]''. In this park, the dominant plant families are the [[Lauraceae]], [[Fagacaeae]], [[Theaceae]] and [[Rosaceae]], with some scattered [[gymnosperm]]s such as ''[[Podocarpus imbricatus]]'', ''[[Podocarpus neriifolius]]'', and ''[[Nageia fleuryi]]''.&lt;ref name="cpv"&gt;[http://www.cpv.org.vn/details.asp?topic=32&amp;subtopic=226&amp;id=BT460561268 Official website of Communist Party of Vietnam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122044537/http://www.cpv.org.vn/details.asp?topic=32&amp;subtopic=226&amp;id=BT460561268 |date=2008-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eoearth"/&gt;

In the park is a 50&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; forest of ''Calocedrus macrolepis'' on limestone (''Calocedrus rupestris'')  mounts with about 2,500 trees, 60,000 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This is the largest forest with this tree in Vietnam. Most of the trees here are 500–600 years old. These trees are listed in group 2A (rare, precious and limited exploitation) of the official letter 3399/VPCP-NN dated 21 June 2002, an amendment to the Decree 48 by the Government of Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Thanh Niên"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.thanhnien.com.vn/Khoahoc/2005/9/6/121442.tno |title=Những phát hiện chấn động về Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng |work=[[Thanh Niên]] |date=6 June 2005 |accessdate=5 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213041344/http://web.thanhnien.com.vn/Khoahoc/2005/9/6/121442.tno |archivedate=13 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanoi National University, in combination with the Research Center of Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park, has discovered 1,320 additional species in this park, of which some groups are assessed as specially rare and precious.

The forest is also home to 98 families, 256 genera and 381 species of vertebrates. Sixty-six (66) animal species are listed in the [[Vietnam's Red Data Book]] and 23 other species in the World [[IUCN Red List|Red Book of Endangered Species]]. In 2005, a new species of [[gecko]] (''[[Lygosoma boehmeiwas]]'') was discovered here by a group of Vietnamese biologists together with biologists working for the park, [[Cologne Zoological Garden|Cologne Zoo]] in Germany and the Saint Petersburg Wild Zoology Institute in Russia.&lt;ref name="reptiles.swelluk"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Lizards Species Found|url=http://www.reptiles.swelluk.com/reptile-news/new-lizard-species-september2007.html|publisher=reptiles.swelluk|date=September 2007|accessdate=2008-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Magazine/MagazinEntwicklungspolitik/062/t4-artenschutz-vietnam-koelner-zoo.html|title=Amphibienvielfalt bewahren|publisher=Die Bundesregierung|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202012233/http://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Magazine/MagazinEntwicklungspolitik/062/t4-artenschutz-vietnam-koelner-zoo.html|archivedate=2008-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gaur]] and one species of eel have been discovered in this park.&lt;ref name="unep-wcmc"/&gt; Ten new species never seen before in Vietnam were discovered by scientists in this national park.&lt;ref name="practicalfishkeeping"&gt;{{cite web|title=New species found in Vietnam|url=http://www.practicalfishkeeping.co.uk/pfk/pages/item.php?news=199|publisher=practicalfishkeeping|date=2004-02-19|accessdate=2008-02-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121215643/http://www.practicalfishkeeping.co.uk/pfk/pages/item.php?news=199|archivedate=2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park is home to significant populations of [[primate]]s in Vietnam, with ten species and sub-species. These include the globally vulnerable [[Northern pig-tailed macaque|pig-tailed macaque]], [[Assam macaque]], [[stump-tailed macaque]] and [[white-cheeked crested gibbon]] (''Nomascus leucogenys'' and ''[[Nomascus leucogenys siki]]''). The park is probably home to the largest population of [[François' langur]] in Vietnam, including two different forms of the species. The area is highly significant for its population of [[Hatinh langur]] and [[black langur]]. It is undoubtedly the largest population of these species in the world, and probably the only population represented in a protected area. Other endangered large mammals include the [[mainland serow]] (''Capricornis sumatraensis''), [[giant muntjac]] (''Megamuntiacus vuquangensis'') and possibly the [[saola]] (''Pseudoryx nghetinhensis''). The [[Asian black bear]] (''Selenarctos thibetanus'') and [[sun bear]] (''Helarctos malayanus'') are confirmed. Other smaller mammals include [[Sunda pangolin]]s (''Manis javanica'') and the recently discovered [[striped hare]], called locally "tho van" (''[[Nesolagus timminsii]]''). Ten bat species listed in the IUCN List of Threatened Species have been recorded in this park.

Of the 59 recorded reptile and amphibian species, 18 are listed in [[Vietnam's Red Data Book]] and 6 are listed in the [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals]].&lt;ref name="unep-wcmc"/&gt; Further research has increased the species numbers markedly, and the number of recorded amphibian species is now 50 and that of reptile species 101.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luu |first1=Vinh Quang |author2=Truong Quang Nguyen |author3=Cuong The Pham |author4=Kien Ngoc Dang |author5=Thanh Ngoc Vu |author6=Sladjana Miskovic |author7=Michael Bonkowski |author8=Thomas Ziegler  |year=2013 |title=No end in sight?

An initiative survey conducted by Russian and Vietnamese scientists from [[Vietnam-Russia Tropical Centre]] (funded by [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]) recorded 259 butterfly species of 11 families. Almost all major butterfly taxa in Vietnam can be found in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng park.&lt;ref name="dgmv"/&gt;

==Historical significance==
The oldest evidence of human occupation of the area are [[Neolithic]] axe heads and similar artifacts found in some of the caves. Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng is home to archeological and historical relics, such as an ancient hieroglyphic script of the [[Cham people|Cham]] ethnic minority.&lt;ref name="unep-wcmc"/&gt; In 1995, the [[Archeological Institute of Vietnam]] remarked that Phong Nha cave is probably an extremely important archeological site. This organization suggested that what remained in Bi Ky grotto may have been a Champa mosque from the 9th to 11th century. Inside Phong Nha cave, many Champa style ceramics, earthware vases with lotus-shaped ruby-colored, slight pink mouth.&lt;ref name="bauchon458"&gt;[http://bauchon.tuoitre.com.vn/Tianyon/Index.aspx?ArticleID=241634&amp;ChannelID=458 "Cái nôi" văn hóa và lịch sử Phong Nha - Kẻ Bàng] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207094930/http://bauchon.tuoitre.com.vn/Tianyon/Index.aspx?ArticleID=241634&amp;ChannelID=458 |date=2009-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, a French missioner, Léopold Cadière surveyed the customs and culture of the local inhabitants living along the Son River. In the letter to [[École française d'Extrême-Orient]], he stated that: "What remains here proves to be valuable for history. To keep it is to help science". In the early 20th century, cave explorers and researchers from France and the UK discovered several ancient Champa and Vietnamese relics, such as altar, steles, hieroglyphic script, sculptures, stone statues, Buddha statues, and Chinese artifacts. King [[Hàm Nghi]] built a base for the Vietnamese resistance against the French [[Colonialism|colonialists]] in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="unep-wcmc"/&gt;

Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park was first nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998. Dossiers was first submitted by Vietnamese government to UNESCO for recognition of Phong Nha nature reserve as a world natural heritage under the name "Phong Nha Nature Reserve". The reason given for the nomination was that this nature reserve satisfied criteria of biodiversity, unique beauty and geodiversity (criteria I and iv).&lt;ref name="birdlifeindochina"/&gt;

In 1999, the [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) conducted a field survey in January and February. At the meeting in July 1999, Evaluation Bureau concluded that Phong Nha Nature Reserve would meet with criteria I and IV as a world heritage nominee on the condition that this nature reserve was expanded to include the larger Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng parkland with an associated fully integrated management structure. This bureau stated that the site was part of an extremely complex and ancient karst plateau with high geodiversity which also encompasses Kẻ Bàng and Hin Namno karsts. The reserve is largely covered in tropical forest with a high level of biodiversity and endemic species. Lack of research means that the true significance of the biodiversity and geology of the area cannot be fully assessed. The evaluation bureau concluded that the nominated area on its own is not considered to meet World Heritage criteria. The Bureau decided to defer the nomination of Phong Nha Nature Reserve.&lt;ref name="uhc.unesco"/&gt;

In 2000, the government of Vietnam submitted a revised nomination with a much larger area. At this time, however, the [[National Assembly (Vietnam)|National Assembly]] and government of Vietnam also announced that it would be constructing the north-south Hồ Chí Minh Highway and a link road between the Highway and Route 20 that bisects part of the core area of the Phong Nha Nature Reserve. The news of this road construction raised concern over its impacts on the Phong Nha Nature Reserve, and many international organization like IUCN, Flora and Fauna International called on Vietnamese government to reconsider its plan. They also advised of the negative impact of these road and construction activities on biodiversity. Due to this plan of road construction, the evaluation bureau did not proceed further consideration of nomination from Vietnamese government at that time. The government of Vietnam provided the bureau with additional information in May 2002, announcing the decision of the [[Prime Minister of Vietnam]] (December 2001) on upgrading Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng to the Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng National Park with a total area of 857.54&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; providing information on projects for the conservation and development of the park and revised maps. The revised nominated site has a smaller area than the 2000 nomination.&lt;ref name="uhc.unesco"/&gt;

It was recognized as a world natural heritage site at the UNESCO's 27th general assembly session being held in Paris, from 30 June to 5 July 2003. At the session, delegates from over 160 member countries of UNESCO World Heritage Convention agreed to include Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng parkland and 30 others worldwide in the list of world heritage sites. Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park meets with criteria viii in accordance with UNESCO's appraisal scale as it displays an impressive amount of evidence of earth's history and is a site of very great importance for increasing human understanding of the geologic, geomorphic and geo-chronological history of the region.&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;

===Recognition for a second time===
The National Council for Cultural Heritage, an organization under the Ministry of Culture and Information of Vietnam (now the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism) recommended the Vietnamese prime minister that Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park be submitted to UNESCO second time for recognition as a world natural heritage for biodiversity. In 2003 this park was listed in UNESCO's world heritage sites for criteria viii "outstanding geological, geomorphical, and geographical values". Vietnamese and international experts believed that if Vietnam timely submits the proposal documents to UNESCO and meet this UNESCO's criteria, this national park will be recognized for a second time in 2008. Since the recognition by UNESCO in 2003, the government of Vietnam has continued to compile scientific documentation to seek recognition of the park as a world natural heritage in terms of biodiversity in addition to geographical values. According to World Wildlife Foundation report in 2000, Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park is one of 200 biodiversity centres of the world and one of the 60 significant sanctuaries of Vietnam. It has a unique forest type in the world: green tropical forest. The park also has 15 other types of forests. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

At the final conference of the National Council for Cultural Heritage held in Vietnam in 2007, scientists attending the meeting highly praised the scientific documentation of Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng park. Accordingly, the park is second to no other national parks listed in UNESCO's world heritage sites as far as biodiversity is concerned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.vietnamnet.vn/tech/2007/11/754641 "Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng again proposed for world natural heritage recognition"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308020043/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/tech/2007/11/754641/ |date=2008-03-08 }}, 17:09' 13/11/2007 (GMT+7), access date: 19 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourist activities==
[[File:Phongnhatourism.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Boats for tourist in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park]]
The park is accessible by road ([[National Route 1A (Vietnam)|National Route 1A]] or [[Ho Chi Minh Highway|Hồ Chí Minh Highway]] 450&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Hanoi]], 50&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Đồng Hới]], 210&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Huế]]); by rail at [[Đồng Hới Railway Station]] on [[North–South Railway (Vietnam)|Hanoi–Saigon Railway]]; by air at [[Đồng Hới Airport]] 45&amp;nbsp;km south of the park. Tourists are served at the Tourism Service Center at [[Sơn Trạch]] [[Rural commune (Vietnam)|commune]] of [[Bố Trạch District]], the entrance of this center is located by Hồ Chí Minh Highway. Tourists are required to buy entrance ticket for package services, including entrance fee, boat service. Ecotourism tour (if needed) requires additional service fee. Tourists then are transported by boat along the [[Son River (Vietnam)|Sơn River]] upstream to the Phong Nha and Paradise caves. The number of tourists has increased dramatically since the park was listed in UNESCO's World Heritage Sites.&lt;ref name="Vietnam News16-9-2004"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tourists flock to Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng bringing alternative to illegal loggers|url=http://www.vnn.vn/kinhte/2004/03/54521|publisher=Vietnam News|date=2004-09-16|accessdate=26 February 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102064931/http://www.vnn.vn/kinhte/2004/03/54521|archivedate=2 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quảng Bình Province has invested in upgrading the Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng visitor site to turn it into one of Vietnam's major tourist destinations.

Numerous ecotourism projects have been licensed for development and the area is being heavily developed by the province to turn it into a major tourist site in Vietnam. Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng is part of a tourism promotion campaign, "[[Middle World Heritage Road]]", which includes the ancient capital of [[Huế]], the [[Champa]] relics of [[Mỹ Sơn]], the city of [[Hội An]], [[Nhã nhạc]] and the [[Space of gong culture]] in the Central Highlands of Vietnam.&lt;ref name="peacetourco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vnn9-3-2004nea"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hành trình "Con đường di sản miền Trung"|url=http://www.vnn.vn/kinhte/2004/03/54521|publisher=Vietnam News|date=9 March 2004|accessdate=24 February 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102064931/http://www.vnn.vn/kinhte/2004/03/54521|archivedate=2 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourist activities in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park are organized by local travel agencies and vary:
* Tour for expedition of caves and grottos in boats and with professional cave expedition means.&lt;ref name="chieuxua"&gt;[http://chieuxua.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1342 du lịch mạo hiểm Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123114449/http://chieuxua.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1342 |date=2008-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ecotourism, discovering the flora and fauna in this national park in the Kẻ Bàng Forest.&lt;ref name="đulichvn"&gt;[http://www.dulichvn.org.vn/thongtinquanly/dautudulich/kdl_phongnha-kebang.htm khu du lịch sinh thái Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123054849/http://www.dulichvn.org.vn/thongtinquanly/dautudulich/kdl_phongnha-kebang.htm |date=2008-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mountain climbing, trekking: There are extreme sloping mountains here with a height of over 1,000 m, which is a real challenge for adventurous climbers.&lt;ref name="chieuxua"/&gt;
: One of the adventure tour sites is boating upward on the Chay River into primitive forests, as the river becomes sinuous with several waterfalls and whirlpools until tourists arrive at Tro Mong. This tour sites have been surveyed and included in local travel agents besides cave exploration tour. In Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng park, there is a 50 m-high waterfall, Chai Waterfall. There is a bull field called Ran Bo (Bull Field) because wild bulls usually comes and reproduce in mating season. There are also some interesting tourist attractions in this park like Nước Ngang ("Horizontal Spring"), a spring runs horizontally instead of vertically as usual; Ðá Nằm (Crouching Stone), a stone blockading a stream current; Chân Thớt (Chopping Board), a chopping-board-shaped stone. But above all, the most spectacular scene is this area is Nước Trồi (Surfacing Stream), a stream surfacing from the ground. Several streams here run for a long distance, then disappear under the ground. The provincial Centre for Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng's Ecotourism and Culture currently has 248 boats, creating jobs for 500 locals. Every boat has two trained boatmen earning VND70,000 per day. This income is relatively high for peasants in this province. This centre also launched a programme in 2000 to train former loggers to work as photographers taking pictures for tourists and about 300 former loggers are now doing this.&lt;ref name="Vietnam News16-9-2004"/&gt;

Đồng Hới is the closest city to Phong Nha. To facilitate the increasing flow of tourists to the site, the [[Đồng Hới Airport]] was constructed and put into operation in May 2008 with air link with [[Hanoi]]'s [[Noi Bai International Airport]] and air link with [[Ho Chi Minh City]]'s [[Tan Son Nhat International Airport]] beginning from 1 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/travel/2008/05/783807|title=Dong Hoi Airport put into use|publisher=VietNamNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides Đồng Hới, Huế is another base city which tourists begins their journey from. Day tours running from Huế are highly common.

Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng, together with [[Hạ Long Bay]] and [[Fansipan|Fanxipan]], is listed as a candidate for seven new world natural wonders vote. On 12 February 2008 it was ranked 10th in the voting list&lt;ref name="new7wonders"&gt;[http://www.new7wonders.com/nature/en/nominees/asia/c/HongNhaKeBangNationalPark/ new7wonders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116120002/http://www.new7wonders.com/nature/en/nominees/asia/c/HongNhaKeBangNationalPark/ |date=2008-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, the United States-based ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' listed Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park in its recommended world's ''29 destinations to visit in 2009''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.latimes.com/articles/la-trw-2009picks-2009jan25?page=2|title=29 destinations to visit in 2009|date=25 January 2009|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, Quang Binh province announced plans by Sun Group to build a cable car system linking caves in the park. The plan was met with a great deal of opposition from conservationists, and the government backtracked, saying that the plan was not yet approved. Proponents say that the area is attracting a growing number of visitors and that the cable car would be the most environmentally friendly means of managing the crowds. Opponents say that construction of the cable car system could damage the fragile caves, and once it is operational it would attract more visitors than the park can sustainably handle.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Rosen, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/03/worlds-largest-cave-vietnam-threatened-cable-car World’s largest cave in Vietnam threatened by cable car], The Guardian, 3 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management issues==

===Management activities===
The Park Management Board includes just 115 people, composed of zoologists, botanists, silviculturalists, and socio-economists. This management staff lacks the authority to fine violators and lacks equipment like helicopters and sufficient funds, thus it's hard to efficiently deal with natural and human threats to the park.&lt;ref name="unep-wcmc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unep-wcmc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="birdlifeindochina"&gt;[http://birdlifeindochina.org/source_book/pdf/Bac%20Trung%20Bo/Phong%20Nha%20-%20ke%20Bang.pdf Microsoft Word: Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng.doc]&lt;/ref&gt;

A semi-wild zone of 0.18&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, surrounded by electrical wire fence, saved for the primate species was created in this park. This project is sponsored by [[Frankfurt Zoological Society|Zoologische Gesellschaft Frankfurt]] (Germany) in order to provide a sanctuary for 10 species of primates, including ''[[Trachypithecus francoisi hatinhensis]]'', [[red-shanked douc langur]] or ''[[Pygathrix nemaeus nemaeus]]''. This protection zone is suitable for primate habitat.&lt;ref name="thiennhien"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thiennhien.net/news/155/ARTICLE/3731/2007-11-30.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211145543/http://www.thiennhien.net/news/155/ARTICLE/3731/2007-11-30.html |archivedate=2008-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Threats to biodiversity===
There are two villages of Arem an Ma Coong ethnic groups in the core zone of the Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park. Within the buffer zone, there is a population of 52,000. They are mainly Kinh people and other minority groups of Chut and Van Kieu, many of them exploit forest products as part of their livelihoods. The increase of visitors to this park is also a problem to the park since unexpected pollution (water pollution, rubbish), human impacts on caves and grottos may cause damage to them and especially threaten biodiversity. Hunting is a significant threat to the wildlife because local people have a great consumption demand on wild meat and this has contributed to the significant decrease of species such as the wild pig, [[binturong]] and primates. While local authorities have taken no legal action, nevertheless, some civil servants and policemen are the owners of restaurants that serve wild animal meats hunted in this national park.&lt;ref name="vnn"&gt;[http://www.vnn.vn/xahoi/doisong/2005/10/501351/ Thú rừng Phong Nha - Kẻ Bàng ngắc ngoải kêu cứu...trong nồi (wild animals in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng forest are dying in cooks)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223214523/http://www.vnn.vn/xahoi/doisong/2005/10/501351/ |date=2007-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="englishvietnamnet24-10-05"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/features/2005/10/503609/|title=Phong Nha – Ke Bang: wild animals cry for help|publisher=Vietnamnet|date=2005-10-24|accessdate=2008-02-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125074719/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/features/2005/10/503609|archivedate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park is currently not meaningful for protection of [[tiger]]s, [[Asian elephant]]s, and wild bulls.&lt;ref name="birdlifeindochina"/&gt;

Rare eels like ''[[Anguilla marmorata]]'' and ''[[Anguilla bicolor]]'' have been caught and consumed in large numbers by the local residents and served as specialities in restaurants because local inhabitants believe they are "natural [[Sildenafil|Viagra]]".&lt;ref name="tienphong29-12-2006"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thượng sơn hỏi chuyện "Đệ nhất cá chình"|url=http://baotienphong.com.vn/Tianyon/Index.aspx?ArticleID=71349&amp;ChannelID=13|work=[[Tien Phong (newspaper)|Tiền Phong]]|date=2006-12-29|accessdate=2008-02-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122073712/http://baotienphong.com.vn/Tianyon/Index.aspx?ArticleID=71349&amp;ChannelID=13|archivedate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excessive exploitation of rare wood such as [[Ebony|go mun]] wood (''Diospyros'' spp.) and go huế wood (''[[Dalbergia rimosa]]'') and oils from trees such as ''[[Cinnamomum balansea]]'', [[rattan]] has cause an exhaustion of these plants in many areas of the park. Bat population in caves and grottos also face disturbance by human activities. [[Ho Chi Minh Highway|Hồ Chí Minh Highway]], [[Road 20 (Vietnam)|Road 20]] crossing the edge zone and the connection road linking these two roads crossing the core zone also contribute danger to the wildlife in this national park, especially populations of [[Hatinh langur]] and [[black langur]]. During the construction of this road, blasts and other activities kept several primates away from their regular habitat.&lt;ref name="wrm"&gt;[http://www.wrm.org.uy/bulletin/41/Vietnam.html Vietnam: Road-building threatens Phong Nha Nature Reserve] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328084037/http://www.wrm.org.uy/bulletin/41/Vietnam.html |date=2008-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="birdlife"&gt;{{cite web|title=BirdLife IBA Factsheet|url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sites/index.html?action=SitHTMDetails.asp&amp;sid=12043&amp;m=0|publisher=BirdLide|accessdate=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to poor management by the local government, many areas of forest in the buffer zone were cleared heavily, some completely.&lt;ref name="tienphong16-11-2006"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rừng vùng đệm Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng bị tàn phá|url=http://www.tienphongonline.com.vn/Tianyon/Index.aspx?ArticleID=66883&amp;ChannelID=3|publisher=|date=16 November 2006|accessdate=22 February 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122025927/http://www.tienphongonline.com.vn/Tianyon/Index.aspx?ArticleID=66883&amp;ChannelID=3|archivedate=22 January 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limestone in the Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng area has been exploited for commercial purposes by local inhabitants, but the local authority has taken no countermeasures to prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng đang bị 'băm nát'|url=http://vnexpress.net/Vietnam/Xa-hoi/2004/08/3B9D54AA|publisher=vnexpress|date=10 August 2004|accessdate=26 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The provincial government approved a 3600MW coal-fueled thermalelectrical plant in Vĩnh Sơn village, Quảng Đông commune, [[Quảng Trạch District]], 40&amp;nbsp;km northeast of this national park. This project has deeply concerned many environmentalists as it will probably cause air and water pollution to the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hãy bảo vệ Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng|url=http://www.quangbinhonline.com/CMS/newsctl.aspx?arId=670&amp;grpid=22&amp;cms_action=0|publisher=quangbinhonline|date=12 November 2007|accessdate=26 February 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212033901/http://www.quangbinhonline.com/CMS/newsctl.aspx?arId=670&amp;grpid=22&amp;cms_action=0|archivedate=12 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildfire during the dry season is a recurring threat to the forest.&lt;ref name="unep-wcmc"/&gt;

===Land management in adjacent areas===
The land management and regulation of the commercial activities in the area surrounding the park have been carried out by the provincial authorities in a disorganized manner. Blocks of land have been sold to local investors and inhabitants for building service utilities in a haphazard way, resulting in the formation of a slum at the entrance of the park. This has been compounded by some investors who do not develop their lots but hold them for future sale. The planning scheme for 2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of land adjacent to the park was criticized by many experts as having been done "without future vision".&lt;ref name="cinet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Phong Nha – Kẻ Bàng: Ngổn ngang chờ quy hoạch|url=http://didulich.net/Public/viewNews_new.jsp?code=25&amp;chude=4|publisher=[[Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism of Vietnam]]|date=2005-12-01|accessdate=2008-02-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214141142/http://didulich.net/Public/viewNews_new.jsp?code=25&amp;chude=4|archivedate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sggp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chuyện lạ ở Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng|url=http://www.sggp.org.vn/phongsudieutra/2006/11/73726|publisher=[[Báo Sài Gòn Giải Phóng]]|date=2006-11-28| accessdate=2008-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quảng Bình's provincial government responded by declaring their intention to recruit internationally recognised planners to help draft tourism development plans for the adjacent areas.&lt;ref name="didulich"&gt;{{cite web| title=Thuê chuyên gia nước ngoài quy hoạch Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng|url=http://didulich.net/Public/viewNews_new.jsp?code=25&amp;chude=4|publisher=didulich.net|date=2007-09-07|accessdate=2008-02-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214141142/http://didulich.net/Public/viewNews_new.jsp?code=25&amp;chude=4|archivedate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International funding===
On November 3, 2005, the German government announced funding valued at 12.6 million euros for the park's management board for the purpose of protecting the biodiversity of the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hanoi.diplo.de/Vertretung/hanoi/vi/Archiv/Presseerklaerung__10__2005.html|title=Đức giúp Vườn quốc gia Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng (Germany donates to Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park)|work=German Embassy in Vietnam|date=2005-11-03|accessdate=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vnagency.com.vn/Home/EN/tabid/119/itemid/233507/Default.aspx|title=Germany helps preserve Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park|work=[[Việt Nam News]]|date=25 January 2007|accessdate=2008-02-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307123430/http://www.vnagency.com.vn/Home/EN/tabid/119/itemid/233507/Default.aspx|archivedate=7 March 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the German government donated a further 1.8 million euros to Vietnam for protection of the park.&lt;ref name="dantri23-10-2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=Đức ủng hộ gần 2 triệu euro cho Vườn Quốc gia Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng|url=http://www1.dantri.com.vn/Sukien/2007/1/202552.vip|publisher=dantri|date=2007-10-23|accessdate=2008-02-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325084028/http://www1.dantri.com.vn/Sukien/2007/1/202552.vip|archivedate=2008-03-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fauna and Flora International]] donated USD 132,000 to Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park Management Board for the protection of primates in this national park as well as in the buffer zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isge.monre.gov.vn/index.php?mod=viewcontent&amp;id_content=609&amp;id_item=23&amp;id_group|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211094652/http://www.isge.monre.gov.vn/index.php?mod=viewcontent&amp;id_content=609&amp;id_item=23&amp;id_group|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-12-11|title=FFI hỗ trợ bảo tồn loài linh trưởng ở Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng|work=ISGE|accessdate=2008-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, FFI conducted a training project for the management staff of the park. The British Commission for International Development sponsored a fund for the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] to protect the biodiversity in the park and in the adjacent [[Hin Namno|Hin Namno Nature Reserve]] in [[Laos]]. FFI received environmental funding from the British [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] to implement a campaign targeted at increasing awareness about biodiversity protection among tourists and locals.&lt;ref name="birdlifeindochina"/&gt;

{{Avicenna sidebar}}
{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |God}}
The '''Proof of the Truthful'''{{sfn|Inati|2014|p=28}} ({{lang-ar|برهان الصديقين|burhan al-siddiqin}},{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=126}} also translated '''Demonstration of the Truthful'''{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=126}} or '''Proof of the Veracious''',{{sfn|Rizvi|2009}} among others) is a [[argument|formal argument]] for proving the [[existence of God]] introduced by the [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] [[Avicenna]] (also known as Ibn Sina, 980{{ndash}}1037). Avicenna argued that there must be a "necessary existent" ({{lang-ar|واجب الوجود|wajib al-wujud}}), an entity that cannot ''not'' exist.{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=170}} The argument says that the entire set of [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent things]] must have a cause that is not contingent because otherwise it would be included in the set. Furthermore, through a series of arguments, he derived that the necessary existent must have attributes that he identified with the [[God of Islam]], including unity, simplicity, immateriality, intellect, power, generosity, and goodness.{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=171}}

[[History of philosophy|Historian of philosophy]] [[Peter Adamson (philosopher)|Peter Adamson]] called the argument one of the most influential medieval arguments for God's existence, and Avicenna's biggest contribution to the history of philosophy.{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=170}} It was enthusiastically received and repeated (sometimes with modification) by later philosophers, including generations of Muslim philosophers, Western Christian philosophers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Duns Scotus]], and Jewish philosophers such as [[Maimonides]].

Critics of the argument include [[Averroes]], who objected to its methodology, [[Al-Ghazali]], who disagreed with its characterization of God, and modern critics who state that its piecemeal derivation of God's attributes allows people to accept parts of the argument but still reject God's existence. There is no consensus among modern scholars on the classification of the argument; some say that it is [[ontological argument|ontological]] while others say it is [[cosmological argument|cosmological]].{{sfn|Mayer|2001|pp=18–19}}

== Origin ==
The argument is outlined in Avicenna's various works. The most concise and influential form is found in the fourth "class" (''fasl'') of his ''[[Remarks and Admonitions]]'' (''Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat'').{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=459}} It is also present in Book{{nbsp}}II, Chapter{{nbsp}}12 of the ''[[Book of Salvation]]'' (''Kitab al-najat'') and throughout the [[The Book of Healing#Metaphysics|''Metaphysics'' section]] of the ''[[Book of Healing]]'' (''al-Shifa'').{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=176}} The passages in ''Remarks and Admonitions'' draw a distinction between two types of proof for the existence of God: the first is derived from reflection on nothing but [[existence]] itself; the second requires reflection on things such as God's creations or God's acts.{{sfn|Inati|2014|p=28}}{{sfn|Inati|2014|pp=130}} Avicenna says that the first type is the proof for "the truthful", which is more solid and nobler than the second one, which is proof for a certain "group of people".{{sfn|Inati|2014|pp=28–29}}{{sfn|Inati|2014|pp=130–131}} According to the professor of Islamic philosophy Shams Inati, by "the truthful" Avicenna means the [[Islamic philosophy|philosophers]], and the "group of people" means the [[Schools of Islamic theology|theologians]] and others who seek to demonstrate God's existence through his creations.{{sfn|Inati|2014|pp=28–29}} The proof then became known in the Arabic tradition as the "Proof of the Truthful" (''al-burhan al-siddiqin'').{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=126}}

== Argument ==
=== The necessary existent ===
Avicenna distinguishes between a thing that needs an external cause in order to exist{{snd}}a ''[[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] thing''{{snd}}and a thing that is guaranteed to exist by its [[essence]] or intrinsic nature{{snd}}a ''necessary existent''.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=127}} The argument tries to prove that there is indeed a necessary existent.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=127}} It does this by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything that exists is contingent. Each contingent thing will need something other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=127}} Because this seemed to lead to an [[infinite regress]], [[cosmological argument]]s before Avicenna concluded that some necessary cause (such as God) is needed to end the infinite chain.{{sfn|McGinnis|2011|p=72}} However, Avicenna's argument does not preclude the possibility of an infinite regress.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=127}}{{sfn|McGinnis|2011|p=72}}

Instead, the argument considers the entire collection (''jumla'') of contingent things, the sum total of every contingent thing that exists, has existed, or will exist.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=127}}{{sfn|McGinnis|2011|p=72}} Avicenna argues that this aggregate, too, must obey the rule that applies to a single contingent thing; in other words, it must have something outside itself that causes it to exist.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=127}} This cause has to be either contingent or necessary. It cannot be contingent, though, because if it were, it would already be included within the aggregate. Thus the only remaining possibility is that an external cause is necessary, and that cause must be a necessary existent.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=127}}

Avicenna anticipates that one could reject the argument by saying that the collection of contingent things may not be contingent. A whole does not automatically share the features of its parts; for example, in [[mathematics]] a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of numbers is not a number.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=128}} Therefore, the objection goes, the step in the argument that assumes that the collection of contingent things is also contingent, is wrong.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=128}} However, Avicenna dismisses this counter-argument as a capitulation, and not an objection at all. If the entire collection of contingent things is not contingent, then it must be necessary. This also leads to the conclusion that there is a necessary existent, the very thing Avicenna is trying to prove. Avicenna remarks, "in a certain way, this is the very thing that is sought".{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=128}}

=== From the necessary existent to God ===
{{Allah|all}}
The limitation of the argument so far is that it only shows the existence of a necessary existent, and that is different from showing the existence of God as worshipped in Islam.{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=171}} An atheist might agree that a necessary existent exists, but it could be the universe itself, or there could be many necessary existents, none of which is God.{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=171}} Avicenna is aware of this limitation, and his works contains numerous arguments to show the necessary existent must have the attributes associated with God identified in Islam.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=128}}

For example, Avicenna gives a philosophical justification for the Islamic doctrine of [[tawhid]] (oneness of God) by showing the uniqueness and simplicity of the necessary existent.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=130}} He argues that the necessary existent must be unique, using a [[proof by contradiction]], or ''reductio'', showing that a contradiction would follow if one supposes that there were more than one necessary existent. If one postulates two necessary existents, A and B, a simplified version of the argument considers two possibilities: if A is distinct from B as a result of something implied from necessity of existence, then B would share it, too (being a necessary existent itself), and the two are not distinct after all. If, on the other hand, the distinction resulted from something not implied by necessity of existence, then this individuating factor will be a cause for A, and this means that A has a cause and is not a necessary existent after all. Either way, the opposite proposition resulted in contradiction, which to Avicenna proves the correctness of the argument.{{sfn|Adamson|2013|pp=177–178}} Avicenna argued that the necessary existent must be simple (not a composite) by a similar ''reductio'' strategy. If it were a composite, its internal parts would need a feature that distinguishes each from the others. The distinguishing feature cannot be solely derived from the parts' necessity of existence, because then they would both have the same feature and not be distinct: a contradiction. But it also cannot be [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental]], or requiring an outside cause, because this would contradict its necessity of existence.{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=180}}

Avicenna derives other attributes of the necessary existent in multiple texts in order to justify its identification with God.{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=171}} He shows that the necessary existent must also be immaterial,{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=171}} [[Nous#Avicenna|intellective]],{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=183}} powerful,{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=171}} generous,{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=171}} of pure good (''khayr mahd''),{{sfn|Adamson|2013|pp=185–186}} willful (''irada''),{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=188}} "wealthy" or "sufficient" (''ghani''),{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=187}} and self-subsistent (''qayyum''),{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=175}} among other qualities. These attributes often correspond to the [[Names of God in Islam|epithets of God found in the Quran]].{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=187}}{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=175}} In discussing some of the attributes' derivations, Adamson commented that "a complete consideration of Avicenna's derivation of all the attributes ... would need a book-length study".{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=172}} In general, Avicenna derives the attributes based on two aspects of the necessary existent: (1){{nbsp}}its necessity, which can be shown to imply its sheer existence and [[negative theology|a range of negations]] (e.g. not being caused, not being multiple), and (2){{nbsp}}its status as a cause of other existents, which can be shown to imply a range of positive relations (e.g. knowing and powerful).{{sfn|Adamson|2013|pp=172–176}}

== Reaction ==
=== Reception ===
Present-day [[history of philosophy|historian of philosophy]] [[Peter Adamson (philosopher)|Peter Adamson]] called this argument one of the most influential medieval arguments for God's existence, and Avicenna's biggest contribution to the history of philosophy.{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=170}} Generations of Muslim philosophers and theologians took up the proof and its conception of God as a necessary existent with approval and sometimes with modifications.{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=170}} The phrase ''wajib al-wujud'' (necessary existent) became widely used to refer to God, even in the works of Avicenna's staunch critics, a sign of the proof's influence.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=126}} Outside the Muslim tradition, it is also "enthusiastically"{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=126}} received, repeated, and modified by later philosophers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274) and [[Duns Scotus]] (1266–1308) of the [[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] tradition, as well by Jewish philosophers such as [[Maimonides]] (d.{{nbsp}}1204).{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=126}}{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=170}}

Adamson said that one reason for its popularity is that it matches "an underlying rationale for many people's belief in God",{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=126}} which he contrasted with [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]'s [[Ontological argument#Anselm|ontological argument]], formulated a few years later, which read more like a "clever trick" than a philosophical justification of one's faith.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=126}} Professor of [[medieval philosophy]] Jon McGinnis said that the argument requires only a few premises, namely, the distinction between the necessary and the contingent, that "something exists", and that a set subsists through their members (an assumption McGinnis said to be "almost true by definition").{{sfn|McGinnis|2011|p=74}}

=== Criticism ===
The Islamic [[Al-Andalus|Andalusi]] philosopher [[Averroes]] or Ibn Rushd (1126{{ndash}}1198) criticized the argument on its methodology. Averroes, an avid [[Aristotelianism#Islamic world|Aristotelian]], argued that God's existence has to be shown on the basis of the natural world, as Aristotle had done. According to Averroes, a proof should be based on [[physics]], and not on metaphysical reflections as in the Proof of the Truthful.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=131}} Other Muslim philosophers such as [[Al-Ghazali]] (1058{{ndash}}1111) attacked the argument over its implications that seemed incompatible with God as known through the Islamic revelation. For example, according to Avicenna, God can have no features or relations that are contingent, so his causing of the universe must be necessary.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=131}} Al-Ghazali disputed this as incompatible with the concept of God's untrammelled free will as taught in Al-Ghazali's [[Asharite]] theology.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=150}} He further argued that God's free choice can be shown by the arbitrary nature of the exact size of the universe or the time of its creation.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=150}}

Peter Adamson offered several more possible lines of criticism. He pointed out that Avicenna adopts a piecemeal approach to prove the necessary existent, and then derives God's traditional attribute from it one at a time. This makes each of the arguments subject to separate assessments. Some might accept the proof for the necessary existent while rejecting the other arguments; such a critic could still reject the existence of God.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=130}} Another type of criticism might attack the proof of the necessary existent itself. Such a critic might reject Avicenna's conception of contingency, a starting point in the original proof, by saying that the universe could just happen to exist without being necessary or contingent on an external cause.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=131}}

== Classification ==
German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724{{ndash}}1804) divided arguments for the existence of God into three groups: [[Ontological argument|ontological]], [[Cosmological argument|cosmological]], or [[Teleological argument|teleological]].{{sfn|Mayer|2001|p=19}} Scholars disagree on whether Avicenna's Proof of the Truthful is ontological, that is, derived through sheer conceptual analysis, or cosmological, that is, derived by invoking empirical premises (e.g. "a contingent thing exists").{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=171}}{{sfn|McGinnis|2011|p=74}}{{sfn|Mayer|2001|p=19}} Scholars Herbert A. Davidson, Lenn E. Goodman, Michael E. Marmura, M. Saeed Sheikh, and [[Soheil Afnan]] argued that it was cosmological.{{sfn|Mayer|2001|p=18}} Davidson said that Avicenna did not regard "the analysis of the concept necessary existent by virtue of itself as sufficient to establish the actual existence of anything in the external world" and that he had offered a new form of cosmological argument.{{sfn|Mayer|2001|p=18}} Others, including Parviz Morewedge, [[Gary Legenhausen]], [[Abdel Rahman Badawi]], Miguel Cruz Hernández, and [[M. M. Sharif]], argued that Avicenna's argument was ontological.{{sfn|Mayer|2001|p=19}} Morewedge referred to the argument as "Ibn Sina's ontological argument for the existence of God", and said that it was purely based on his analytic specification of this concept [the Necessary Existent]."{{sfn|Mayer|2001|p=19}} Steve A. Johnson and Toby Mayer said the argument was a hybrid of the two.{{sfn|McGinnis|2011|p=74}}{{sfn|Mayer|2001|p=19}}

Seventh-day Adventists believe that [[Ellen G. White]], one of the church's co-founders, was a [[prophetess]], understood today as an expression of the [[New Testament]] [[spiritual gift]] of [[prophecy]].{{sfn|Fundamental Beliefs}}

Seventh-day Adventist believe that White had the [[spiritual gift]] of [[prophecy]], but that her writings are inferior to the Bible, which has ultimate authority. According to the [[28 Fundamentals]] the core set of [[Christian theology|theological]] beliefs held by the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], states that Adventists accept the [[Bible]] as their only creed and can be read online on the website of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.{{sfn|Fundamental Beliefs}}

The 18 of the 28 Fundamentals states the Adventists  viewpoint on the Gift of Prophecy: 
:"One of the gifts of the Holy Spirit is prophecy. This gift is an identifying mark of the remnant church and was manifested in the ministry of Ellen. G. White . As the Lord's messenger, her writings are a continuing and authoritative source of truth which provide for the church comfort, guidance, instruction, and correction. They also make clear that the Bible is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested. (Joel 2:28, 29; Acts 2:14-21; Heb. 1:1-3; Rev. 12:17; 19:10.)."{{sfn|Fundamental Beliefs}}

According to one church document, "her expositions on any given Bible passage offer an inspired guide to the meaning of texts without exhausting their meaning or preempting the task of exegesis".{{sfn|General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|1986}}{{sfn|Seventh-day Adventists believe|2005|p=259}} In other words, White's writings are considered an inspired commentary on Scripture, although Scripture remains ultimately authoritative.

Adventist believe she had the [[spiritual gift]] of [[prophecy]] as outlined in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 19:10. Her [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restorationist]] writings endeavor to showcase the hand of God in [[Christian]] history. This cosmic conflict, referred to as the "[[Great Controversy theme]]", is foundational to the development of [[Seventh-day Adventist theology]].

== Viewpoints ==
"The Inspiration and Authority of the Ellen G. White Writings",  document was issued by the [[Biblical Research Institute]] of the [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists]]. It has received worldwide review and input, although is not an official statement. It concludes that a proper understanding will avoid the two extremes of regarding her "writings as functioning on a [[Biblical canon|canonical]] level identical with Scripture, or […] considering them as ordinary Christian literature."{{sfn|Biblical Research Institute|1982}}

Seventh-day Adventists believe White was inspired by God, while most non-Adventists believe that she was not. Adventist scholars today agree that:
*she was inspired by God
*her writings are important to the church today
*the Holy Spirit who inspired Bible writers, also inspired Ellen G. White{{sfn|Brown|2003|p=29}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Three Strategic Issues: A World Survey|2002}} (a non-scientific survey), See also a {{harvnb|reprint of Three Strategic Issues|2002}} on the ''Adventist Review'' website. For reports on the survey, see {{harvnb|Special Report on Annual Council|2002}} and {{harvnb|Brown|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberto Timm, rector at the Latin-American Adventist Theological Seminary in Brasilia, Brazil, believes that since the passing of Ellen White, "as far as we know, there is no genuine prophet alive in our days".{{sfn|Timm|2008}}

== History ==
Numerous Seventh-day Adventists have claimed the gift of prophecy throughout the history of the church, but only Ellen White is held by the church to have had the [[spiritual gift]] of [[prophecy]].

=== Millerites ===
{{see also|Millerism}}
Seventh-day Adventists arose out of the [[Millerism|Millerite movement]], the followers of [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]] who expected the end of the world around 1843 or 1844. A number of the Millerites claimed the gift of prophecy.

Two Millerites claimed to have had visions prior to Ellen White – [[William Foy|William Ellis Foy]] (1818–1893), and [[Hazen Foss]] (1818?–1893), Ellen White's brother-in-law. Adventists believe the gift offered to these two men was instead passed on to White.{{sfn|Nix|1986|p=22}}

Of the women visionaries, several made the press for their visions.

==== William Foy ====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:UnknownProphet.jpg|thumb|right|{{pufc|1=UnknownProphet.jpg|log=2009 March 25}}]] --&gt;
William Ellis Foy (1818–1893) was an African American [[Freewill Baptist]] minister and preacher in the Millerite movement, who claimed to receive four [[Hallucination|visions]] from 1842 (two visions) to 1844. A tall man, he was the first of three Millerites to claim visions around the time of the 1844 "[[Great Disappointment]]".

A common theme of his visions was that the [[Second Coming]] would come later than the Millerites expected. They inspired many people through the Great Disappointment when Jesus did not return as they had expected. Ellen White supported his visions.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen White, "[http://egwdatabase.whiteestate.org/nxt/gateway.dll/egw-comp/section12951.htm/book14069.htm/chapter14086.htm MR No. 1253 - William Foy Lectures in Beethoven Hall]" p95–97 of ''Manuscript Releases, Volume 17'', Hagerstown, Maryland: Review and Herald, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; They also concern the judgment, and rewards for the righteous.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20110522065632/http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/RH/RH19871015-V164-42/index.djvu?djvuopts&amp;page=16 The inside story about people and events that shaped our history]". ''[[Adventist Review]]'' 164:42 (October 15, 1987), p16&lt;/ref&gt;

He claimed visions in January and February 1842, told in his autobiographical ''The Christian Experience of William E. Foy'', published 1845.&lt;ref&gt;''The Christian Experience of William E. Foy Together with the Two Visions He Received in the Months of Jan. and Feb. 1842'' by Foy. Published by John and C. Henry Pearson in Portland, 1845. OCLC 76043021.

Foy was reluctant to obey his commission to share the visions, yet did eventually. He never became a Seventh-day Adventist, and his subsequent history was unknown. [[John Norton Loughborough|J. N. Loughborough]]'s account&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20120223233523/http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/RP/RiseAndProgress/index.djvu?djvuopts&amp;page=72 Rise and Progress of the Seventh-day Adventists]'' (DjVu), 1892, p70 onwards&lt;/ref&gt; was simply repeated by later historians&lt;ref&gt;http://www.andrews.edu/~jmoon/Documents/CHIS_570/CHIS_570%20Lecture_Outline.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. ''Light Bearers'', 64) until [[Delbert Baker]]'s definitive 1987 biography ''The Unknown Prophet'' traced his subsequent history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==== Hazen Foss ====
Hazen Foss (1818–1893) was another Millerite who claimed to receive several visions. However he refused to proclaim them, and God told him he was "released" from that ministry, and the message given to Ellen White instead.&lt;ref&gt;''The Unknown Prophet'' p134–141&lt;/ref&gt; He was Ellen White's brother-in-law. Adventists tend to believe the prophetic gift offered to these two men was instead passed on to White.{{sfn|Nix|1986|p=22}}

=== Early Adventists ===
{{see also|Adventism}}
Adventists believe [[Hiram Edson]] received a vision about the [[heavenly sanctuary]] or [[investigative judgment]] on October 23, 1844 – the day following the "[[Great Disappointment]]". He wrote,
:"...while passing through a large field I was stopped about midway of the field. Heaven seemed open to my view, and I saw distinctly and clearly..." Jesus as [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]]&lt;ref&gt;Hiram Edson, from a manuscript fragment about his life and experiences; as quoted by [[Francis D. Nichol]] in ''The Midnight Cry'' (Washington: Review and Herald, 1945), 458. A critical article is "[http://www.truthorfables.com/Edson%27s%20final%20version%20with%20appendices%20corrected.pdf Edson's Cornfield 'Vision:' Frisson or Fiction?]" by Fernand Fisel: a revised version of "Edson's Cornfield Vision, Frisson or Figment?" ''[[Adventist Currents]]'' 1:1 (July 1983), pp.25–27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moses Hull]] (c. 1836–1907) was an eloquent speaker and apologist (defender of Adventist beliefs). He converted to Adventism in 1857, but later converted to [[spiritualism]] (the key feature of which is allegedly contacting the dead), leaving the church. He claimed to write as influenced by [[spirit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Light Bearers: A History of the Seventh-day Adventist Church'' revised and updated edition, ed. Richard W. Schwarz and Floyd Greenleaf. (Nampa, Idaho: Pacific Press, 2000), 613–614&lt;/ref&gt;

For two years prior, Ellen White had trying to help Moses Hull and been warning him on his focus and "overweening trust in his own abilities."&lt;ref&gt;Bio., vol. 2, p. 55. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Hull sensed his problem and asked for Ellen White and others to come to his Battle Creek home to pray for him. Ellen writes "I was shown the condition of Bro. Hull. He was in an alarming state. His lack of consecration and vital piety left him subject to Satan's suggestions. . . . He is asleep to his own danger. . . . He was presented to me as standing upon the brink of an awful gulf, ready to leap. If he takes the leap, it will be final; his eternal destiny will be fixed. . . . Never should one man be sent forth alone to combat with a Spiritualist."&lt;ref&gt;Testimonies, vol. 1, pp. 426-430; see Bio., vol. 2, pp. 56, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ellen White ===
[[File:Ellen G White.jpg|thumb|right]]
{{Main|inspiration of Ellen White}}
Adventists believe church co-founder [[Ellen G. White]] was a [[prophet]], understood today as the [[New Testament]] "[[spiritual gift|gift]] of [[prophecy]]".&lt;ref&gt;This terminology is used in the [[28 Fundamentals]], the official beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists. Also see for example, "[http://www.adventistbiblicalresearch.org/documents/Biblical%20Basis%20for%20Prophet.htm The Biblical Basis for a Modern Prophet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002100207/http://www.adventistbiblicalresearch.org/documents/Biblical%20Basis%20for%20Prophet.htm |date=2008-10-02 }}" by Frank B. Holbrook, [[Biblical Research Institute]], April 1982. Also [http://www.whiteestate.org/issues/Biblebasis.html appearing] on the White Estate website. "[http://www.whiteestate.org/issues/CanAllBeProphets.html Can All Be Prophets? Ellen G.

She was one of about 200 claimed prophets in New England at the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sdanet.org/atissue/books/bradford/prophet-14.htm Bradford&lt;/ref&gt; For alleged miracles which occurred during her prophecies, see: [[inspiration of Ellen White#Tests of her inspiration]].

White regarded herself as a messenger to the church of the end times.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen White ''Selected Messages'' book 1, p55&lt;/ref&gt; She believed her contemporary prophets were not legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen White ''Selected Messages'' book 1, p55; book 2, p64, 65, 72–84, 89. See also Denton Rebok, ''Believe His Prophets'', 113–17; as cited elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt;

=== E. J. Waggoner ===
[[E. J. Waggoner]] claimed "a [[revelation]] direct from heaven" at a campmeeting in [[Healdsburg, California|Healdsburg]], [[California]] in 1882. In the midst of another's sermon,
:"...an experience came to me that was the turning point in my life. Suddenly a light shone about me, and the tent seemed illumined, as though the sun were shining; I saw [[Christ]] crucified for me, and to me was revealed for the first time in my life the fact that God loved me, and that Christ gave Himself for me personally."&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Waggoner, ''The Everlasting Covenant'', v. As quoted in David P. McMahon. ''Ellet Joseph Waggoner: The Myth and the Man'' (Fallbrook, California: Verdict Publications, 1979). Chapter 2, "A Biographical Sketch" – [http://sdanet.org/atissue/books/mcmahon/waggoner-02.htm SDANet AtIssue version], [http://www.presenttruthmag.com/7dayadventist/Waggoner/2.html ''Present Truth Magazine'' version]. See also E. J. Waggoner, ''Confession of Faith'', p5–6; which was published posthumously&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899 he claimed that all commandment keepers should have the gift of prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;''Light Bearers'', p617&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After 1888 ===
The [[1888 Minneapolis General Conference]] provided "impetus" to those radically seeking God's presence.

==== Anna Phillips ====
Anna Rice Phillips (1865–1926) was a claimed new prophetess, who was supported by [[W. W. Prescott]] and others. From [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], [[Utah]], she first claimed visions in 1891, and in April, 1894, Adventist minister A.T. Jones presented Anna Phillips's testimonies as a genuine manifestation of the spirit of prophecy.
However the next day he got a letter from Ellen White which convinced the church she was sincere yet mistaken. Anna Phillips repudiated her experience and became a trusted Bible worker.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Seeking a Sanctuary]]'', 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://whiteestate.org/books/pay/PAYaxA.html#sth1 An Experience With a False Prophetess]" section, p469–71 of Appendix A in ''A Prophet Among You'' by T. Housel Jemison&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.puc.edu/heritage/bib-arphilp.html Anna Rice Phillips, Battle Creek prophetess]: A bibliographical guide to sources in the Heritage Room, [[Pacific Union College]] Library. Gary W. Shearer. See also [http://jewel.andrews.edu:82/search/XAnna+Phillips SDAPI articles]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="America"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://egwdatabase.whiteestate.org/nxt/gateway.dll/egw-comp/section00000.htm/book04611.htm/chapter04623.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Others ====
By the 1890s, a "flood of volunteers" stepped forward, hoping to be the next prophet. However Ellen White usually responded to them that she had been given no "light" about the future prophetic gift.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5, "The Los Angeles Seventh-day Adventist Reform Church", p84-99 of Tarling&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fannie Bolton]], a former literary assistant to White, claimed visions around the end of the 1800s.&lt;ref name="America"/&gt;

In the 1900s, Mrs. Mackin claimed the gift of prophecy, and under her and her husband Ralph's influence, a young girl (a family friend) also prophesied; see: [[Ralph and Mrs. Mackin]].

==== Anna Garmire ====
Anna Garmire (b. 1870) from [[Petoskey, Michigan|Petoskey]], [[Michigan]] claimed visions. She believed the close of probation would occur 40 years after the [[Great Disappointment]]. Her father James M. stole the ''Review and Herald'' mailing list and sent out this prediction to 20,000 people. Ellen White rejected Anna's theories, and authored the tract, ''An Exposure of Fanaticism and Wickedness'' in response.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://egwdatabase.whiteestate.org/nxt/gateway.dll/egw-comp/section12557.htm/book12749.htm An Exposure of Fanaticism and Wickedness]'' by Ellen White. South Lancaster, Massachusetts, August 7, 1885. White Estate pamphlet no. PH030&lt;/ref&gt; After 1884 passed, James wrote to Ellen White and she responded to their predictions critically. The Garmires influenced others in this way until as late as 1900.&lt;ref name="America"&gt;''Adventism in America'' ed. Gary Land, p105–6. As quoted in ''Another Gospel'' by Ruth A. Tucker, p106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.spectrummagazine.org/articles/sabbath_school/2009/02/16/authority_prophets The Authority of the Prophets]" by Michael W. Campbell on the ''Spectrum'' blog; "A Commentary on the Sabbath School Lesson for February 14–20, 2009"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://egwdatabase.whiteestate.org/nxt/gateway.dll/egw-comp/section00000.htm/book04611.htm/chapter04621.htm Chap. 8 - Meeting the Claims of False Prophets]" in ''Selected Messages'' book 2, p72–79 by Ellen White&lt;/ref&gt;

==== German Reform Movement ====
In Germany in 1915 Johann Wick, an Imperial Army member, claimed a vision of the close of probation "at the time the stone-fruit trees blossomed in the spring." Other lay people also reported similar visions and some became involved in the [[Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;''Light Bearers'', p619–21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this section could be placed after Ellen White --&gt;

=== After Ellen White ===
Ellen White died in 1915. According to her son [[William C. White|Willie White]], subsequently "A dozen or more persons" claimed the gift, to succeed Ellen. He considered some "good-hearted but misguided", but others fanatical and who denounced those remaining unconvinced by their claims.&lt;ref&gt;W. C. White, ''Battle Creek Enquirer'' 25 July 1915. As quoted by Tarling&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Margaret Rowen ====
Margaret W. Rowen claimed to receive visions, and formed an alternative short-lived church, the Reformed Seventh-day Adventist Church (not to be confused with the much more significant [[Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement]]).

Rowen became an Adventist in 1912. She claimed to receive her first vision on June 22, 1916 which she shared with members of a prayer group at her South Side Los Angeles Church, gaining a small following. Several church leaders, especially Dr. Bert E. Fullmer, supported her. A periodical ''The Reform Advocate and Prayer Band Appeal'' was printed.&lt;!-- Gardner says from 1922 to 1926, but this seems to contradict other accounts--&gt; The [[Southern California Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|Southern California Conference]] investigated the claims, but was originally inconclusive.
She authored ''A Stirring Message for the Time'' (Pasadena, California: The Grant Press, 1918). In 1918, [[A. G. Daniells]] reported the investigators had concluded her visions were not of heavenly origin. The following year Rowen, Fullmer, a physician, and at least two other ministers were disfellowshipped.

In 1920, a false document was planted by Fullmer (under Rowen's directive) in the [[Ellen G. White Estate]] files in White's home. Dated 1911 and supposedly written by White, it announced Rowen as a succeeding prophetess. At its peak, the movement had around 1000 followers. Rowen gave several false predictions. Fullmer authored ''Bearing Witness'' (Los Angeles: The Reform Press, 1923). In 1925, Fullmer admitted the fraudulent letter. In the March 1926 issue of the periodical, he presented his conclusion that Rowen was a fraud. In response, she conspired to murder him the following year, but was unsuccessful. She served a one-year sentence in the [[San Quentin State Prison]] in California, by which time her movement had fallen apart.&lt;ref&gt;"Reformed Seventh-day Adventist Church" in ''Historical Dictionary of Seventh-day Adventists'' by [[Gary Land]], p243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Seeking a Sanctuary]]'', p203–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larry White, "[http://archives.llu.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/advhert&amp;CISOPTR=731&amp;REC=11 Margaret W.

==== Others ====
Numerous leaders of offshoot groups have also claimed the gift of prophecy for themselves, for example [[Victor Houteff]], founder of the [[Shepherd's Rod]] offshoot. [[Benjamin Roden]] was another, founder of the [[Branch Davidian]] offshoot of Shepherd's Rod,&lt;ref&gt;''The Branch Davidians of Waco'' by [[Kenneth Newport|Kenneth G. C. Newport]], 136&lt;/ref&gt; whose wife [[Lois Roden]] succeeded him as prophetess, and claimed a vision about the feminity of the Holy Spirit. [[David Koresh]] considered himself the final prophet. He apparently saw himself as Ellen White's successor.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.atoday.com/content/koresh-ellen-white Koresh on Ellen White]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}" by Dennis Hokama.

He is known as Wayne Travesser within that community.

Adventist author [[Clifford Goldstein]] has described some "nut cases" and meeting "some of the weirdest and most bizarre folks you could imagine", with these types of claims.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.atoday.com/content/do-we-attract-them-or-do-we-create-them Do We Attract Them or Do We Create Them?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918154518/http://atoday.com/content/do-we-attract-them-or-do-we-create-them |date=2010-09-18 }}" by Clifford Goldstein, ''[[Adventist Today]]'' blog, 9 August 2008. "More than 23 years ago, for instance, some guy came to the GC [General Conference] and wanted us to hire him. If not, he said, he was going to call on the Lord bring a black cloud over the GC and envelop the church headquarters into total darkness for as long as it took until we saw the light and gave him a job. I remember, too, another fellow who every year used to sit at Annual Council because, from his study of the Book of Revelation, the silence in heaven meant that the Annual Council would supernaturally be silenced and, at that moment, God would give him the message for the world church. He was dead serious."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abkhaz native religion==
{{see also|Abkhaz neopaganism}}
The Abkhaz native religion has undergone a revival in recent decades.&lt;ref name="russiaotherpointsofview.com"/&gt; As of 2003 8% of the population of Abkhazia (thus a higher percentage among ethnic Abkhazians) declares to be "pagan". It is worthwhile to note that the equivalent of the term "pagan" in Abkhazian (as well as Russian) language, язычник ''yazychnik'', means "ethnic" rather than "country dweller" like its Western counterpart. One scholar has asserted that the Abkhazian traditional religion has become so well established and intertwined with the government to be almost the state religion of the country.&lt;ref name=Agababyan2016/&gt;

In the Abkhaz native religion, Antsua (also spelled Antzva) is the supreme God and the creator of life. The native religion is animistic, there are deities that represents thunder and the weather like Afy, others that represent the forests, wild animals, and hunting like Ayerg and Azhvepshaa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The religion has a host of different Gods that cater for each aspect of the world. Abkhaz gods have "Apaimbari" meaning angels and observers that function as representatives of the Gods on earth. They keep track of everything that is done amongst the people, while reporting everything back to the Gods.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discoverabkhazia.org/single-post/2015/07/20/Ancient-Religion-of-Abkhazia|title=Discover Abkhazia|website=Discover Abkhazia|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The followers of this religion have 7 holy temples among which 6 have been restored “Dydrypsh-nykha,” “Lashkendar-nykha,” “Ldzaa-nykha,” “Lykh-nykha” and “Ulyr-nykha.” The sixth sanctuary “Inal-Kuba” is located in a mountain valley of Pskhu, which is now populated by Russians. However, the name of the 7th temple is still disputed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to the 2003 census, 60% of respondents identified themselves as Christian.&lt;ref name=portal-credo/&gt; The two main churches active in Abkhazia are the [[Abkhazian Orthodox Church]] and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. There are approximately 140 church buildings in Abkhazia, most of which date from the first millennium.&lt;ref name="uzel162065"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abkhasia.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/162065/|script-title=ru:Абхазская православная церковь обратилась к духовенству Грузии с братским посланием|last=Kuchuberia|first=Anzhela|date=17 November 2009|publisher=Caucasian Knot|language=Russian|accessdate=29 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abkhazian Orthodox Church operates outside the official [[Eastern Orthodox Church organization|Eastern Orthodox ecclesiastical hierarchy]], as all Eastern Orthodox churches recognise Abkhazia as belonging to the jurisdiction of the [[Georgian Orthodox church]].&lt;ref&gt;Witness through troubled times : a history of the Orthodox Church of Georgia, 1811 to the present, Abashidze, Zaza.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A long walk to church: a contemporary history of Russian Orthodoxy, 2nd ed, Davis, Nathaniel&lt;/ref&gt; The Georgian Orthodox Church lost effective control over the ''Sukhumi-Abkhazian eparchy'' following the [[War in Abkhazia (1992-1993)|1992-1993 war in Abkhazia]], when ethnically Georgian priests had to flee Abkhazia.

The [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] has accused the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] of interfering in its internal affairs, thereby violating Orthodox [[canon law]], by training and sending into Abkhazia priests,&lt;ref name="state"/&gt; publishing translations of the [[Gospels]] into the [[Abkhaz language]] and annexing Georgian Orthodox property in Abkhazia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geotimes.ge/index.php?m=home&amp;newsid=2810 The Georgian Times on the Web: Comprehensive news site, daily international, national and local news coverage , breaking news updates, sports, reviews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928085246/http://www.geotimes.ge/index.php?m=home&amp;newsid=2810 |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Orthodox Church claims that the priests it has sent serve in Abkhazia only temporarily while the local Orthodox believers do not have contacts with the Georgian Orthodox Church.&lt;ref name=blagovest/&gt;

May 15, 2011 at the National Assembly of the Church in the city of New Athos (Anakopiya), proclaimed the establishment of a new church organization - the Holy Metropolis of Abkhazia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.anyha.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628120907/http://en.anyha.org/ |archivedate=2012-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church in Abkhazia]] is the third largest Christian denomination and mostly consists of mainly Armenians, Poles, and expatriates living in Abkhazia. The Holy See does not have diplomatic relations with Abkhazia, but has enjoyed two high level visits from the apostolic nuncio.

====History of Christianity in Abkhazia====
The earliest accounts of the introduction of Christianity into the present-day Abkhazia date from the 1st century AD,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patriarchate.ge/istoria/1e.htm HISTORY OF THE ORTHODOX CHURCH OF GEORGIA {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728121453/http://www.patriarchate.ge/istoria/1e.htm |date=28 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 325, when the bishop of Pityus (present day [[Pitsunda]]) participated in the [[First Council of Nicaea|First Ecumenical Council in Nicaea]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/syriac_misc.htm EXTRACTS FROM THE SYRIAC MS. NO. 14528 IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM. WRITTEN A.D. 501. Names of Bishops&lt;/ref&gt; From around the 9th century onwards, the Orthodox dioceses of Abkhazia were governed by the [[Catholicate of Abkhazia]], subordinated to the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]]. The Catholicate of Abkhazia and the Georgian Orthodox Church were abolished in 1795 and 1811 and the dioceses taken over by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. The Georgian Orthodox Church regained its independence in 1917, after the fall of [[Tsar Nicholas II]].

During the 1992-1993 war in Abkhazia, the Georgian Orthodox church effectively lost control of Abkhazian church affairs as ethnically Georgian priests had to flee Abkhazia and the Abkhaz Priest [[Vissarion Aplaa]] became acting head of the Sukhumi-Abkhazian eparchy. In the following years, recently consecrated clerics from the neighbouring Russian [[Maykop Eparchy]] arrived in Abkhazia, who eventually came into conflict with Vissarion. Through the mediation of Russian church officials, the two sides managed to reach a power-sharing agreement at Maikop in 2005, but this did not hold.&lt;ref name=blagovest&gt;[http://www.blagovest-info.ru/index.php?ss=2&amp;s=3&amp;id=6177 Вновь обострился конфликт внутри православной общины Абхазии].

In April 2008, the last Georgian Orthodox priest remaining in the predominantly Georgian-populated [[Gali District, Abkhazia|Gali district]] was expelled, reportedly by Abkhaz security officers, after a "special decree" of the Sukhumi-Abkhazian Eparchy, effectively leaving the local Georgian community without access to clergy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=1118 Abkhazia: Only Georgian Orthodox priest expelled.].

On 15 September 2009, the Sukhumi-Abkhazian Eparchy led by Vissarion declared that it no longer considered itself part of the Georgian Orthodox Church, that it was re-establishing the [[Catholicate of Abkhazia]], and that it would henceforth be known as the ''Abkhazian Orthodox Church''.&lt;ref name="agov23092"/&gt;

Thousands of Abkhaz, known as ''[[Ethnic Cleansing of Circassians|muhajirun]]'', fled Abkhazia for [[Ottoman Empire]] in the mid-19th century after resisting the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] conquest of the Caucasus. Today, [[Turkey]] is home to the world's largest Abkhaz diaspora community.

[[Romania]] is a [[secular state]], and it has no state religion. Romania is one of the most religious countries in the [[European Union]] and a majority of the country's citizens are [[Christian]]. The Romanian state officially recognizes 18 religions and denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.culte.gov.ro/biserici-culte |title=Culte recunoscute oficial în România |work=Secretariatul de Stat pentru Culte |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814135847/http://www.culte.gov.ro/biserici-culte |archivedate=2016-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 81.04% of the country's stable population identified as part of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in the 2011 census (see also: [[History of Christianity in Romania]]). Other Christian denominations include the [[Catholic Church]] (both [[Latin Church|Latin Catholicism]] (4.33%) and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Greek Catholicism]] (0.75%–3.3%)), [[Calvinism]] (2.99%), and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] denominations (1.80%). This amounts to approximately 92% of the population identifying as Christian. Romania also has a small but historically significant [[Islam|Muslim]] minority, concentrated in [[Northern Dobruja]], who are mostly of [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] ethnicity and number around 44,000 people. According to the 2011 census data, there are also approximately 3,500 [[Jews]], around 21,000 atheists and about 19,000 people not identifying with any religion. The 2011 census numbers are based on a stable population of 20,121,641 people and exclude a portion of about 6% due to unavailable data.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.recensamantromania.ro/rezultate-2/ |title=Populația stabilă după religie – județe, municipii, orașe, comune |work=Institutul Național de Statistică}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Greek Catholics live in the northern part of [[Transylvania]]. Most are Romanians (124,563), with the remainder mostly Hungarians or Roma.

On the other hand, according to data published in the 2012 ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'', the Romanian Greek Catholic Church had 663,807 members (3.3% of the total population), 8 bishops, 1,250 parishes, some 791 diocesan priests and 235 seminarians of its own rite at the end of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnewa.org/source-images/Roberson-eastcath-statistics/eastcatholic-stat12.pdf |title=The Eastern Catholic Churches 2012 |work=Annuario Pontificio |publisher=CNEWA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute over the figure is included in the [[United States Department of State]] report on [[religious freedom]] in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/238636.pdf |title=Romania 2014 International Religious Freedom Report |work=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] continues to claim many of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church's properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/au-tr-dat-greco-catolicii-ortodoxia |title=Au trădat greco‑catolicii ortodoxia? |work=Historia.ro |author=George Rădulescu |date=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protestantism ===
{{See also|Reformed Church in Romania|Unitarian Church of Transylvania|Evangelical Lutheran Church of Romania|Evangelical Church of Augustan Confession in Romania}}
According to the 2011 census, [[Protestant]]s make up 6.2% of the total population. They have been historically been made up of [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], although in recent years [[Evangelical Protestants]], [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]] and newer Protestant groups spread and are holding a greater share. In 1930, prior to [[World War II]], they constituted approximately 8.8% of the Romanian population. The largest denominations included in this figure (6.2%) are the [[Reformed Church in Romania|Reformed]] (2.99%) and the [[Pentecostal Union of Romania|Pentecostals]] (1.8%). Others also included are [[Baptist Union of Romania|Baptists]] (0.56%), [[Romanian Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|Seventh-day Adventists]] (0.4%), [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania|Unitarians]] (0.29%), [[Christian Evangelical Church of Romania|Plymouth Brethren]] (0.16%) and two Lutheran churches (0.13%), the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Romania]] (0.1%) and the [[Evangelical Church of Augustan Confession in Romania]] (0.03%). Of these various Protestant groups, Hungarians account for most of the Reformed, Unitarians, and Evangelical Lutherans; Romanians are the majority of the Pentecostals, Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists and Evangelical Christians; while Germans account for most of the Augustan Confession Evangelicals (i.e. Lutherans historically subscribing to the [[Augsburg Confession]]). The majority of Calvinist (Reformed Church) and Unitarians have their services in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].

Not to be confused with any of the above is the [[Evangelical Church of Romania]] (0.08%), an unrelated Protestant denomination.

According to the legal status of the Muslim denomination, the Romanian Muslim community is officially represented by a ''mufti'', while the Muftiat is the denominational and cultural representative institution of the Muslim community,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.muftiyat.ro/muftiatul/despre-noi/ |title=Despre noi |work=Muftiatul Cultului Musulman din România}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a status similar with that of the other denominations officially recognized by the Romanian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=dCAU6Bz5QIEC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;dq=muslims+in+romania&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3g4irTBnmp&amp;sig=_XqofhA8onCq_afGSCBa0dSZqQA&amp;hl=ro&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ7qG94a7OAhVJSBQKHQSlBlA4ChDoAQhhMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=muslims%20in%20romania&amp;f=false |chapter=Muslim institutions and organizations in Romania |title=Muslims in Poland and Eastern Europe: Widening the European Discourse on Islam |editor=Katarzyna Górak-Sosnowska |publisher=University of Warsaw |date=2011 |page=268 |isbn=978-83-903229-5-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Muslims in Constanța, which comprise approx. 6% of the population of this county, are represented in the [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] by the [[Democratic Union of Turkish-Muslim Tatars of Romania]], founded on 29 December 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} {{cite web |url=http://uniuneatatara.ro/despre-noi |title=Despre noi |work=Uniunea Democrată a Tătarilor Turco-Musulmani din România}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other religions ===
Other denominations not listed above but recognised as official religions by the Romanian state are listed here. The [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] number around 50,000 adherents (0.25% of the stable population). [[Old Believers]] make up about 0.16% of the population with 30,000 adherents, who are mainly ethnic [[Russians]] living in the [[Danube Delta]] region. [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] believers are present in the areas which border [[Serbia]] and number about 14,000 people. Once fairly well represented in Romania, [[Judaism]] has fallen to around 3,500 adherents in 2011, which is about 0.02% of the population. Less still is the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Christian]] minority, numbering about 400 people in total. The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] reports 1,869 [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] in the country as of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40.asp |title=Most Baha'i Nations (2005) |work=Association of Religion Data Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the number of people who have identified with other religions than the ones explicitly mentioned in the 2011 census comes to a total of about 30,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/publicatii/pliante%20statistice/08-Recensamintele%20despre%20religie_n.pdf |title=Ce ne spune recensământul din anul 2011 despre religie? |work=Institutul Național de Statistică |date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paganism ===

[[File:Dacian Sacred Fire ceremony year 2013.jpg|thumb|200px|Zalmoxian fire rite]]
[[Neopagan]] groups have emerged in Romania over the latest decade, virtually all of them being ethno-pagan as in the other countries of [[Eastern Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=1863263 |title=Romanian and Hungarian Ethno-Pagan Organizations on the Net |author=Hubbes László-Attila, Rozália Klára Bakó |work=Reconect Working Paper No. 1/2011 |publisher=Sapientia – Hungarian University of Transylvania |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1863263}}&lt;/ref&gt; although still small in comparison to other movements such as ''[[Ősmagyar Vallás]]'' in [[Hungary]] and ''[[Rodnovery]]'' in the [[Slavs|Slavic Europe]].

The revived [[ethnic religion]] of the Romanians is called [[Zalmoxianism]] and is based on 
[[Thracian]] mythological sources, with prominence given to the figure of god [[Zalmoxis]].&lt;ref name="pfi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ro.paganfederation.org/zalmoxianism/ |title=Zalmoxianism |work=Federația Păgână Internațională – România}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most prominent Zalmoxian groups is the [[Gebeleizis]] Association ({{lang-ro|Societatea Gebeleizis}}).&lt;ref name="pfi" /&gt;

=== Irreligion ===
{{Main article|Irreligion in Romania}}
Approximately 40,000 people have identified as nonreligious in Romania in the 2011 census, out of which 21,000 declared [[atheist]]s and 19,000 [[agnostic]]s. Most of them are concentrated in major cities such as Bucharest or Cluj-Napoca.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} {{cite web |url=http://incont.stirileprotv.ro/infografice/religiile-romaniei-bucurestiul-cel-mai-mare-procent-de-atei-din-tara-judetul-unde-se-regasesc-cei-mai.html |title=Religiile României.

== Attitudes towards religion ==
In 2008, 19%&lt;!-- The figure listed in the study was 31, but it seems it was an error as it was changed to 19% --&gt; of Romanians placed "Faith" among maximum four answers to the question "Among the following values, which one is most important in relation to your idea of happiness?". It is the third highest number, after [[Cyprus]] (27%), and [[Malta]] (26%), at equality with [[Turkey]] (19%). The mean in EU-27 was 9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb69/eb69_values_en.pdf |title=Eurobarometer 69 |work=European Commission |date=November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study by the [[Soros Foundation]], over three quarters of Romanians consider themselves religious people, in a greater amount from rural areas, from women, from elders and from those with low income.&lt;ref name="soros"&gt;{{ro icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.fundatia.ro/sites/default/files/Romanii%20devin%20mai%20toleranti%20religios_analiza%20studiului.pdf |title=Atitudini religioase la români: religia și biserica sunt în continuare foarte importante; cu toate acestea, românii au un model religios valoric mai critic și mai tolerant |work=Fundația Soros |author=Raluca Popescu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romanians believe in religious dogmas and the church, without absolutizing this belief, showing tolerance towards those who do not fully comply with the divine word, towards other religions and even towards some scientific truths.&lt;ref name="soros" /&gt; 

In 2011, 49% of Bucharesters declared that they only go to church on social occasions (weddings, [[Easter]], etc.) or not at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.csb2035.ro/pdf/facts/cartografiere_socio.pdf |title=Cartografierea socială a Bucureștiului |work=Școala Națională de Studii Politice și Administrative}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to preliminary data from the national 2011 census, 98.4% of the population declared themselves adherents of a religious denomination. This figure was contested,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-13125809-asociatia-secular-umanista-din-romania-contesta-datele-privind-religia-din-rezultatele-preliminare-ale-recensamantului-anuntate-ins.htm |title=Asociația Secular-Umanistă din România contestă datele privind religia din rezultatele preliminare ale Recensământului anunțate de INS |work=HotNews.ro |date=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the number of believers in disproportionately large. The final data for the 2011 national census shows a reduction of this figure to about 93.5% but includes a much larger portion of the population where religion-related data is missing (6.26%).

According to a survey conducted in July 2015, 96.5% of Romanians believe in [[God]], 84.4% believe in [[saint]]s, 59.6% believe in the existence of [[heaven]], 57.5% in that of [[hell]], and 54.4% in [[afterlife]].&lt;ref name="digi"&gt;{{ro icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Actualitate/Social/Sondaj+96+5+dintre+romani+cred+in+Dumnezeu |title=Sondaj: 96,5% dintre români cred în Dumnezeu |work=Digi24 |date=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 83% of Romanians say they observe Sundays and religious holidays, 74.6% worship when they pass by a [[church (building)|church]], 65.6% say they pray regularly, 60.2% state they sanctify their belongings, house, car, and 53.6% of Romanians donate regularly to the church.&lt;ref name="digi" /&gt;

The Cambodian '''Republican Party''' was a short-lived political movement established during the [[Khmer Republic]] period (1970–75).

==History==

The Republican Party was one of the new parties established in the aftermath of the [[Cambodian coup of 1970]], which had overthrown the [[Sangkum]] regime of Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]].

It was first formed in 1971, as the "Independent Republican Association", by Tep Khunnah, a close associate of coup leader Prince [[Sisowath Sirik Matak]]. The Republican Party was formally created on June 15, 1972 in preparation for parliamentary elections to be held that year; Sirik Matak became its Secretary-General. It adopted the symbol of male and female heads, to indicate its emphasis on "family values".&lt;ref name=corfieldsummers350&gt;Corfield, J. and Summers, L. ''Historical dictionary of Cambodia'', Scarecrow Press, p.350&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican Party was essentially a vehicle for Sirik Matak's interests, and functioned mainly as an alternative to the power bloc of the other coup leader General [[Lon Nol]], whose brother [[Lon Non]] controlled the [[Social Republican Party|Socio-Republican Party]] (PSR). Whereas the latter cultivated a populist power base, encompassing both radical students and - importantly - the [[Khmer National Armed Forces]], the Republicans attracted the urban elite, Sino-Khmer businessmen, and a handful of military officers (such as [[Thongvan Fanmuong]]). Although the Republicans' nationalist platform was in many ways similar to that of the PSR, Sirik Matak's rather aloof style placed him at a disadvantage to the populism of Lon Nol. When the elections were eventually held on September 3, 1972, the Republicans refused to participate, citing numerous irregularities in favour of the PSR.&lt;ref name=corfield79&gt;Corfield, J. ''The History of Cambodia'', ABC-CLIO, 2009, p.79&lt;/ref&gt;

The political situation in the Khmer Republic continued to unravel, and on March 25, 1973, Tep Khunnah was the target of an assassination attempt when a grenade was thrown into his car.&lt;ref name=corfield80&gt;Corfield, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was widely believed to be the work of Lon Non, whose "Republican Security Battalion" was linked with such activities by Western intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name=clymer69&gt;Clymer, K. J. The United States and Cambodia, 1969-2000: a troubled relationship, Routledge, p.69&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressure from the Americans, who wished to see a broader government in Phnom Penh, eventually led to Non resigning his positions and removing himself to Paris. A "High Political Council" was set up, including Sirik Matak, Lon Nol, [[Cheng Heng]], and [[In Tam]].&lt;ref name=corfield80&gt;Corfield, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; Republican Party delegates were invited into the ''de facto'' coalition government, although they were not allowed to vote in an Assembly they still regarded as illegal. Tep Khunnah had in the meantime run into Lon Non in a Paris nightclub, punching him and causing him to lose several teeth.&lt;ref name=corfield80&gt;Corfield, p.80&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the appointment of the "High Political Council", Sirik Matak and the Republicans were unable to break the dominance of the PSR before the total collapse of the Khmer Republic on April 17, 1975.

The '''''Sahaj Paath''''' or ''Sadharan Path'' is the reading from beginning to end, with no time-limit for completion. of the ''[[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]]'', the [[Sikh]] Scriptures, which can be done at the reader's schedule. A ''Paath'' may be fulfilled by one or more readers, and the pace depends entirely on those reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sikhanswers.com/worship-ceremonies-institutions/procedure-for-sehaj-paath/|title=What is the procedure for a Sehaj Paath? {{!}} Sikh Answers|last=|first=|date=2010-04-12|website=www.sikhanswers.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulfilling the ''Paath'' can be done in honor of a particular occasion or simply to increase one’s feeling of connection to the [[Guru]]. When done monthly, it gives the [[Sadh Sangat]] Congregation a beautiful opportunity to establish a close relationship with the Guru and provides the blessing of His Word to the community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5256">'''Secularism in Egypt''' has had a very important role to play in both the history of Egypt and that of the Middle East.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Egypt’s first experience of Secularism started with the [[History of Egypt under the British|British Occupation (1882–1952)]], the atmosphere which allowed the protection of debate. In this environment pro-secularist intellectuals like Ya'qub Sarruf, Faris Nimr, Nicola Haddad whom sought political asylum from Ottoman Rule were able to publish their work. This debate had then became a burning issue with the work of Egyptian Shaykh [[Ali Abdel Raziq]] (1888–1966), “''The most momentous document in the crucial intellectual and religious debate of modern Islamic history''”&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Fauzi Najjar, ''The debate on Islam and Secularism'', Arab Studies Quarterly; 1996, Vol. 18 Issue 2&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 1919 Egypt had its first political secular entity called the ''Hizb 'Almani'' (Secular Party) - this name was later changed to the [[Wafd Party]]. It combined secular policies with a nationalist agenda and had the majority support in the following years against both the rule of the king and the British influence. The Wafd party supported the allies during [[World War II]] and then proceeded to win the 1952 parliamentary elections. Following these elections the prime minister was [[Egyptian revolution of 1952|overthrown]] by the King leading to riots. These riots precipitated a military coup after which all political parties were banned including the Wafd Party and the [[Muslim Brotherhood]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The government of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] was secularist-nationalist in nature which at the time gathers a great deal of support both in Egypt and other Arab states{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}.

Key elements of [[Nasserism]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opendemocracy.net/conflict-middle_east_politics/egypt_mahfouz_4025.jsp Mahfouz's grave, Arab liberalism's deathbed | openDemocracy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Secularist/Nationalist dictatorship; No religious or other political movements allowed to impact government
*Modernization
*Industrialization
*Concentration on Arab values rather than Muslim values

Following the death of Nasser, President [[Anwar Sadat]] (1970–1981) continued [[economic liberalization]] and maintained the government's secularist policy{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, even going as far as signing [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|peace agreements with Israel]] which was a first for any Middle Eastern country. However, following further intensive clampdowns on political opposition, Sadat was assassinated and replaced by [[Hosni Mubarak]] who again faces the issue of keeping the Islamist support at bay whilst keeping his power base during increased pressure to be democratic.&lt;ref&gt;David Marquand and Ronald L. Nettler, ''Religion and democracy'', p 67&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, most proponents of secularism emphasize the link between secularism and ‘national unity’ between [[Coptic Christians]] and [[Muslims]].

Following the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011]] as part of the regional [[Arab Spring]] protests,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/world/middleeast/25egypt.html&lt;/ref&gt; Mubarak was ousted and the following year [[Mohamed Morsi]] who is backed by the Muslim Brotherhood won Egypt's first democractic [[Egyptian presidential election, 2012|elections]]. In 2013 Morsi was removed from power in a [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|coup]] led by [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/03/mohamed-morsi-egypt-second-revolution&lt;/ref&gt; Sisi has called for religious tolerance and has cracked down and banned the Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/05/egypt-salafist-sufi-religion-extremism-azhar-quran-sheikh.html&lt;/ref&gt; He has closed thousands of mosques and has banned '[[burkini]]s' on some beaches. A ''[[The Economist]]'' report in 2017 stated that Egyptians were turning more secular again, with supporters of [[sharia]] law dropping by more than half since 2011, people praying less than before, and gender equality now being widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21730899-they-are-consolidating-their-own-power-process-despots-are-pushing&lt;/ref&gt; The government has also acted to preserve its [[Jewish]] heritage through the restoration of the abandoned [[Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue (Alexandria)|Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue]] in [[Alexandria]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/08/egypt-antiquities-ministry-renovate-jewish-temples.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21728590-egypts-leaders-have-increased-their-outreach-shrinking-jewish&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Shadchan''''' ({{Lang-he|שַׁדְּכָן}}, plural '''''shadchanim''''' or '''''shadchonim''''' {{Lang-he|שַׁדְּכֳנִם}}) is a [[Hebrew]] word for [[matchmaking|matchmaker]].

The word Shadchan often refers to ''Shadchanim'' or people who carry out [[Shidduchim]] as a profession within the religious Jewish community. However, Shadchan can also be used to refer to anyone who introduces two single Jews to one another with the hope that they will form a couple. Centuries of experience and tradition have shown that a good match is most likely to be formed between people with similar outlooks, attitudes, beliefs and backgrounds.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Therefore, a matchmaker is most likely to be someone who is familiar with both sides and is in a position to introduce the interested parties to each other. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Other sects and schools==
There may be some Shinto schools and sects, that even having a structure and followers, are not included in authoritative publications. This may be because of their small size and influence, fairly unknown presence or practices, or because those schools are new branches from older schools and still considered within their structure.
&lt;!-- Add under this line other schools and an inline citation with the source of that information --&gt;

'''Six of Cups''' is a [[Minor Arcana]] [[tarot]] card.

==History==
Tarot cards are used throughout much of [[Europe]] to play [[tarot card games]].&lt;ref name="DummettGame"&gt;
{{cite book
  | last = Dummett
  | first = Michael
  | authorlink = Michael Dummett
  | title = The Game of Tarot
  | publisher = [[Gerald Duckworth and Company Ltd.]]
  | date = 1980
  | isbn = 0-7156-1014-7
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, where the games are largely unknown, Tarot cards came to be utilized primarily for [[Tarot reading|divinatory]] purposes.&lt;ref name="DummettGame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]], (2004) ''Mystical Origins of the Tarot: From Ancient Roots to Modern Usage'', Vermont: Destiny Books, {{ISBN|0-89281-190-0}}
[http://www.innertraditions.com/Product.jmdx?action=displayDetail&amp;id=887&amp;searchString=huson&amp;y=7&amp;x=7 ''Mystical Origins of the Tarot''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225647/http://www.innertraditions.com/Product.jmdx?action=displayDetail&amp;id=887&amp;searchString=huson&amp;y=7&amp;x=7 |date=September 27, 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divination usage==
The six of cups in the esoteric use of the card stands for innocence and nostalgia when it is an upright position. When this card is in a reversed position, it represents the themes of being  stuck in the past, naïve, and unrealistic. Another way it has been interpreted is that it means that it is time to look back to a simpler way of thinking. Unquestionable love is a more modern interpretation. &lt;ref name="Biddy Tarot"/&gt; The children that are used on the card are there to promote the idea of children being able to hold on to love and to not respond with emotion like adults tend to do.&lt;ref name=Keen&gt;{{cite web|title=The Six of Cups Tarot Card|url=http://www.keen.com/documents/works/articles/tarot/6-of-cups-tarot-card.asp|publisher=Keen|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If the card appears in the reversed position, it indicates a fixation on times which have passed, nostalgia or ruminations on childhood. 

==Identification==
The six of cups card can be identified by the six cups that are filled with flowers The flowers have five points and they are white. Also in the picture, there is an older boy who seems to be smelling the flower while handing it to a younger girl. In the background of the photo, there is a figure walking away from the younger children which appears to be an older person. There is a house and a garden in the background as well. The main color of the image is yellow. Each of these symbols can be interpreted in different ways depending on who is interpreting them. Also there are certain card combinations that, if drawn with the Six of Cups during your reading, the card will be influenced in a certain way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lunarcafe.com/tarot/cards/the-suit-of-cups/six-of-cups |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140625222013/http://www.lunarcafe.com/tarot/cards/the-suit-of-cups/six-of-cups |archivedate=2014-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Biddy Tarot"&gt;{{cite web|title=Six of Cups Tarot Card Meanings|url=http://www.biddytarot.com/tarot-card-meanings/minor-arcana/suit-of-cups/six-of-cups/|publisher=Biddy Tarot|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=LearnTarot&gt;{{cite web|last=Bunning|first=Joan|title=Learn Tarot|url=http://www.learntarot.com/c6.htm|publisher=Learn Tarot|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biographical Sketch ==
Sabhāpati's earliest biographical sources&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; record that after being educated at a Christian missionary school, he traveled to [[Burma]] ([[Myanmar]]) on textile trade business with his father-in-law, where he interacted with Buddhist ''phongyi'' ("monks"). Returning to Tamil Nadu, he soon departed for the predominantly Islamic ''[[Marakkar|maraikkāyar]]'' port city of [[Nagore Dargah|Nagore]] (near [[Nagapattinam|Nagappatinam]]), where he interacted with [[fakir]]s at the 16th century ''[[dargah]]'' of the [[Sufism|Sufi]] pir [[Saiyid Abd al-Qadir Shahul Hamid Naguri]] (1502-1570 C.E.). [[File:A Minaret of the Nagore Dargah.jpg|thumb|A Minaret of the Nagore Dargah.]]Following his travels in Burma and Nagapattinam (which together lasted three years), Sabhāpati's "admirer" mentions that despite his exploits in comparative religion his "mind was not at ease" and that he was still "far from obtaining the true Spirituality (''brahma-jñāna'')." This anxiety gave way to a midnight vision at the age of twenty-nine, when the Vedic sage [[Agastya]] appeared and told him to go to Vedaśreṇi, a once rural temple site now situated amid a rapidly developing tech hub in modern Chennai ([[Velachery]], Tamil: Veḷacceri). At Vedaśreṇi it is said that he obtained ''śiva-darśana''. It is here that Agastya again communicated to Sabhāpati his desire for him to travel to a hermitage deep in the heavily-forested [[Nilgiri mountains|Nīlagiri]] ("Blue Mountain") range of South India, situated on the borders of the modern states of Tamil Nadu, [[Karnataka]] and [[Kerala]]. After a long journey his biography records that he encountered his guru who welcomed him into the company of adepts. Śrī Sabhāpati Swami then returned to Madras with a new-found spiritual passion, and the accounts agree that he began to publish his various works and that he also went on pilgrimages to many of the major Hindu temple circuits in India and Nepal ([[Kedarnath Temple|Kedarnāth]], [[Muktinath|Muktināth]], and [[Pashupatinath Temple|Paśupatināth]]) before traveling to [[Lahore]] (in modern-day [[Pakistan]]). The exact year or location of his death is as yet unknown, although he published his last book (in the Tamil language) in 1915.

== Teachings on Yoga ==
[[File:The Twelve Faculties of Sabhāpati Swami.png|thumb|The Twelve Faculties of Sabhāpati Swami (original diagram published in 1884, with new overlaid references pointing to the cakra referred to in the text itself).]][[File:Sabhāpati's diagram on svarūpa ("inherent forms").pdf|thumb|Sabhāpati's diagram on svarūpa ("inherent forms")]]Śrī Sabhāpati Swami’s literature contains detailed meditations that are designed to pierce one’s veils of delusion (''bhrānti''), caused by deceiving impressions (''vāsana''), in order to reach an isolated state of liberation (''mukti''). The delusions lift through a gradual awakening the ''kuṇḍalinī'' and its accompanying ''jñānākāśa'' ("aether of gnosis") or ''prāṇākāśa'' ("aether of vitality") along twelve ''cakra''s of the spine and through four transcendent principles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also advocated (yet kept distinct from Rājayoga proper) are "nine states of practice": [[Patanjali|Patañjali]]’s standard fare of ''aṣṭāṅga'' — ''yama'', ''niyama'', ''āsana'', ''prāṇāyāma'', ''dhāraṇā'', ''dhyāna'', ''samādhi'' — plus ''samyāma'', glossed as the cancellation "of consciousness of all internal and external faculties."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These practices allow the yogi to embody various "essential images" or "inherent forms" (''svarūpa''s), which Sabhāpati variously glosses as "spiritual visions," "spiritual states," or "spiritual phenomena." In one diagram, for instance, he outlines as many as seven ''svarūpa''s, which he calls the "seven spiritual states of God." These are formulated in the mind through processes of ''bhāvana'' "meditative formulation," a term used in a technical sense to describe the assumption of a specific form to the exclusion of anything else.

== Publication history ==
While lecturing in Lahore, Sabhāpati met his editor [[Srisa Chandra Vasu|Sriṣa Chandra Vasu]] (Bengali: Basu) (1861-1918), an educated Bengali civil servant and Sanskritist who himself moved in Theosophical circles and published widely on yoga, including an early edition of the ''[[Shiva Samhita|Śiva-saṃhitā]]''. Mark Singleton points out in his landmark study that Vasu later came to be an icon of early 20th century Hindu revivalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern Posture Practice|last=Singleton|first=Mark|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0195395341|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they published Sabhāpati's lectures in English with transliterated Sanskrit terms as early as 1880, over fifteen years ''before'' [[Swami Vivekananda]]'s ''Rāja Yoga'' (1896), the publication of which Elizabeth De Michelis convincingly demonstrates as marking the birth of modern yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Modern Yoga: Patañjali and Western Esotericism|last=De Michelis|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Continuum|year=2004|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original title of Sabhāpati's work was ''Om: a treatise on Vedantic Raj Yoga and Philosophy'' (1880), and it attracted even the attention of Indologists such as [[Max Müller]], who cites it in his work ''The Six Systems of Indian Philosophy'' (1899). [[Henry Steel Olcott|Henry Olcott]]'s personal copy of this book has also been located in the library at [[Adyar, Chennai|Adyar]], and reviews of it and Sabhāpati's other works populate early Theosophical periodicals. Elaborations and revisions of this 1880 text were later published in various languages, including in Sanskrit, Hindi and a Tamil version that, if the account of Sabhāpati's "admirer" is to be believed, likely contains material that predates the 1880 work in English. One of the most notable versions is a much more precisely edited and visually stunning two-part volume entitled ''Om: Cosmic Psychological Spiritual Philosophy and Science'', published four years later in 1884.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This work combined material published in 1880 with even more practical instructions, visual diagrams and associative correspondences. Another version was published in 1892 in Sanskrit ([[Devanagari|Devanāgarī]] script) and Hindi, using the Sanskrit version of the previous work's title, ''Rājayoga brahmajñānānubhūti saṅgraha veda''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rājayoga Brahmajñānānubhūti saṅgraha veda nāmaka grantha|last=Swami|first=Sabhapaty|publisher=Tattvavivecaka Chāpakhāna|year=1892|isbn=|location=Mumbai|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work also stayed in print well into the 20th century. In 1908 a German translation based on the 1880 work was made by one of the founders of the O.T.O., the Theosophist author [[Franz Hartmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Die Philosophie und Wissenschaft des Vedanta und Rāja-Yoga oder Das Eingehen in Gottheit von Mahātma Ināna Guru Yogi Sabhapatti Svāmī aus dem Englischen übersetzt von Franz Hartmann|last=Hartmann|first=Franz|publisher=Jaeger|year=1909|isbn=|location=Leipzig|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915 an exclusively Tamil Sanskrit edition was published in Madras with a few new diagrams. Sabhāpati's works also made their way to the United States, and the eclectic and profiteering William Estep published a stripped down version of the two-volume 1884 edition in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Esoteric cosmic yogi science, or, Works of the world teacher|last=Swami|first=Sabhapaty|last2=Estep|first2=Wm|publisher=Super Mind Science Publications|year=1929|isbn=|location=Excelsior Springs, MO|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, a revised edition based on a later edition of the 1880 work was published in 1950 from a Hindu temple publisher in [[Mumbai]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Philosophy and science of Vedanta and Raja Yoga|last=Swami|first=Sabhapaty|publisher=C.P.

== Relationship with Traditions of Early Modern Yoga ==

}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Michael Kolson and Kurt Leland, however, Sabhāpati has been mostly overlooked by authors and practitioners researching the subject of early modern yoga and tantra.

=== Relationship with the Theosophical Society ===
Sabhāpati originally seems to have been on good terms with members of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society]], as he is cited favorably in their works and periodical journals. However, he lost their favor after a misunderstanding over a vision in which he claimed to have been caught up to [[Lake Manasarovar]]a in modern Tibet to commune with [[Shiva|Mahādeva]] on [[Mount Kailash|Mount Kailāśa]]. The vision, which he communicated as happening in his physical body, is reminiscent of [[Kālidāsa]]'s classical Sanskrit poem "[[Meghadūta]]," in which a cloud-messenger travels in the air to Mount Kailāśa to send a message on behalf of a lonely ''[[Yaksha|yakṣa]]'' to his lover. In any event, the Theosophists seem to have taken it literally — [[Henry Steel Olcott|Henry Olcott]] (1832-1907) records in his diaries that both he and [[Helena Blavatsky|H.P. Blavatsky]] (1831-1891) were disenchanted with Sabhāpati after they met with him personally and he recounted his vision to them in terms of a physical experience. Olcott writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;Whatever good opinion we may have formed of him before was spoilt by a yarn he told us of his exploits as a Yog. He had, he said, been taken up at Lake Mânsarovara, Tibet, high into the air and been transported two hundred miles along the high level to Mount Kailâs, where he saw Mahadeva! Ingenuous foreigners as H.P.B. and I may have been, we could not digest such a ridiculous falsehood as that. I told him so very plainly. If, I said, he had told us that he had gone anywhere he liked in astral body or clairvoyant vision, we might have believed it possible, but in physical body, from Lake Mânsarovara, in company with two Rishis mentioned in the Mahabharata, and to the non-physical Mount Kailâs—thanks, no: he should tell it to somebody else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Old Diary Leaves, Second Series 1878-83|last=Olcott|first=Henry S.|publisher=The Theosophical Publishing Society|year=1900|isbn=|location=London|pages=258–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A response to this negative view can be traced in later editions of Śrī Sabhāpati Swami's works. For example, the 1895 reprint to ''OM'' adds the following footnote (presumably written by Vasu) in the part of Sabhāpati's account that mentions this vision: &lt;blockquote&gt;"This need not have been in the ''physical'' body of the Rishis; they might have flown towards the holy mountain in their ''Mayavi Rupa Kama Rupa'' (astral body), which to our author (who certainly is not an Adept in the sense the Theosophists use the word) must have been as real as if he had travelled through air in his physical body."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Om. The Philosophy &amp; Science of Vedanta and Raja Yoga.|last=Svāmi|first=Sabhāpati|publisher=The New Lyall Press|year=1895|isbn=|editor-last=Vasu|editor-first=Srīṣa-Candra|location=Lahore|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;In any event, either from this misunderstanding or from other issues the Theosophical Society subsequently abandoned the support it may have had previously for Sabhāpati and his works.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Relationship with Thelema ===
Whereas the early Theosophists ultimately dismissed Sabhāpati, the British occultist and poet [[Aleister Crowley]] (1875-1947) came to deeply appreciate his work and cited him often in his literature. He wrote in his ''Confessions'' that he first became attracted to Sabhāpati's literature during his travels in 1901 to [[Ceylon]] (modern [[Sri Lanka]]) and Madurai en route to visit his friend [[Charles Henry Allan Bennett|Allan Bennett / Ananda Maitreya Bhiksu]] (1872-1923), a fellow initiate of Crowley's in the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Confessions of Aleister Crowley: An Autohagiography|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|publisher=Hill and Wang|year=1970|isbn=|editor-last=Symonds|editor-first=John|location=New York|pages=252–258|editor-last2=Grant|editor-first2=Kenneth}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Crowley's sojourn in [[Madurai]] he became exposed to Sabhāpati's works and became particularly interested in Sabhāpati's rich visual meditations (''dhyāna'') on the spinal cord as a phallus (''liṅga'') and the cranial vault as the kteis (''yoni''), which he published in modified form as an instruction for his students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Liber HHH: SSS" in The Equinox, vol. I, no. 5|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|publisher=Simpkin Marshall|year=1911|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabhāpati's subtle physiology is situated around twelve tantric cakras and four transcendent states, which in part may also explain Crowley's willingness to entertain notions of additional ''cakra'' to the commonly known system of seven (or "six plus one") as usually found in Western "New Age" systems of the ''cakra'' that follow the pattern laid out by [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|Charles W. Leadbeater]] (1854-1934) and [[John Woodroffe|John Woodroffe / Arthur Avalon]] (1865-1936). In any case, the continuing practice of certain aspects of Sabhāpati's system does live on in Thelema, a religio-philosophical tradition deeply associated with Crowley.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''''Tafsir Urwa-Tul-Wusqa''''' is a ''[[tafsir]]'' (Islamic exegesis) claiming to disprove the [[virgin birth of Jesus]] by reference to [[Quran]]ic verses. This contradicts traditional Islamic views [[Jesus in Islam|of Jesus]] and [[Mary in Islam|of Mary]]. The text was written in [[Urdu]] by Abdul Kareem Asri, and [[Ahl-i Hadith]] scholar from [[Gujrat City]], Pakistan. It incorporates the ideology of [[Sir Syed Ahmad Khan]] with traditional Ahl-i Hadith thought.

Japan|accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most often used in the religious and moral sense.&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt; Originally, the word indicated a divine punishment due to the violation of a divine taboo through evil deeds, defilement (''[[kegare]]'') or disasters.&lt;ref&gt;Iwanami {{nihongo|[[Kōjien]]|広辞苑}} Japanese dictionary, 6th Edition (2008), DVD version, "Tsumi"&lt;/ref&gt; When translated in English as "sin", the term covers therefore only one of the three meanings of the Japanese word.&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt;

==History==
The term evolved to its present form as a contraction of {{nihongo|''tsutsumu''|障む・恙む|to hinder, be hindered, to have an accident, to have some trouble}},&lt;ref&gt;Definition from the Iwanami [[Kōjien]] Japanese dictionary, 6th Edition (2008), DVD version, "Tsutsumu"&lt;/ref&gt; a verb which very generally indicated the occurrence of a negative event.&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt; In ancient Japan the word thus indicated not only crimes and other forbidden human actions, but also diseases, disasters, pollution, ugliness and any other unpleasant object or fact.&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt; 
 
The [[Engishiki]], a 927 AD Japanese book of laws and regulations, for example, distinguishes two kinds of ''tsumi'', the {{nihongo|Amatsutsumi|天津罪|heaven tsumi}} and the {{nihongo|kunitsutsumi|国津罪|land tsumi|}}.&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt; The first category deals with infractions against property, the second mainly with infractions against people. Some of the ''tsumi'' have to do with disease and natural disasters, and are not therefore ''sins'' in the modern sense, but order perturbations (''[[kegare]]'') which had to be dealt with and solved by the person or persons concerned in certain ways, for example through purification rites called ''[[harae]]''.

The '''Universal Waite tarot deck''' is based on original line drawings for the [[Rider-Waite-Smith deck|Rider-Waite-Smith]] [[tarot]] deck by [[Pamela Colman Smith]]. It is not known whether the flat colours used in the standard Rider-Waite were Smith's idea or her publisher's, especially since the [[Rider-Waite tarot deck|Original Rider-Waite Tarot]], a facsimile edition of the deck as it first appeared in 1907, shows slightly deeper, richer colours.

By popular demand, illustrator [[Mary Hanson-Roberts]], creator of the [[Hanson-Roberts Tarot]], was commissioned to produce a more subtly and attractively coloured rendition of the [[Rider-Waite-Smith deck]]. The Universal deck first appeared in the early 1990s.  The copyright held on the original deck appears only to be valid towards particular coloured editions, thus recreating from the original line art with new colouring has allowed this deck to grow in popularity based on familiarity and visual appeal. It comes in a standard large size and a minuscule travel edition in a keyring case.

'''William Erwin Eisner''' (March 6, 1917 – January 3, 2005) was an American [[cartoonist]], writer, and entrepreneur. He was one of the earliest cartoonists to work in the [[American comic book]] industry, and his series ''[[The Spirit]]'' (1940–1952) was noted for its experiments in content and form. In 1978, he popularized the term "[[graphic novel]]" with the publication of his book ''[[A Contract with God]]''. He was an early contributor to formal [[comics studies]] with his book ''[[Comics and Sequential Art]]'' (1985). The [[Eisner Award]] was named in his honor, and is given to recognize achievements each year in the comics medium; he was one of the three inaugural inductees to the [[List of Eisner Award winners#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame]].

==Biography==

===Family background===

Eisner's father Shmuel "Samuel" Eisner was born March 6, 1886, in [[Kolomyia]], [[Austria-Hungary]], and was one of eleven children.  He aspired to be an artist, and as a teenager painted murals for rich patrons and Catholic churches in [[Vienna]].  To avoid conscription in the army, he moved to New York before the outbreak of [[World War I]].{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=2}}  There he found getting work difficult as his English skills were poor.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|pp=2–3}}  He made what living he could painting backdrops for [[vaudeville]] and the [[Jewish theater]].{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=3}}

Eisner's mother, Fannie Ingber, was born to [[Jewish]] parents from Romania April 25, 1891, on a ship bound for the US.  Her mother died on her tenth birthday, and was quickly followed by her father.  An older stepsister thereafter raised her and kept her so busy with chores that she had little time for socializing or schooling; she did what she could later in life to keep knowledge of her illiteracy from her children.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=3}}

Family introduced Shmuel and Fannie, who were distant relatives.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|pp=3–4}}  They had three children: son Will Erwin, born on his father's birthday in 1917; son Julian, born February 3, 1921; and daughter Rhoda, born November 2, 1929.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=4}}

===Early life===

Eisner was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York City.  He grew up poor, and the family moved frequently.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=4}}  Young Eisner often got into physical confrontations when subjected to [[antisemitism]] from his schoolmates.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=6}}  His family were not orthodox followers of [[Judaism]]; Eisner himself, while he prided his cultural background, turned against the religion when his family was denied entry to a synagogue over lack of money for admission.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|pp=7–8}}

Young Eisner was tall and of sturdy build, but lacked athletic skills.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=10}}  He was a voracious consumer of [[pulp magazines]] and film, including avant-garde films such as those by [[Man Ray]].{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|pp=8–9}}  To his mother's disappointment, Eisner had his father's interest in art, and his father encouraged him by buying him art supplies.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=10}}

Eisner's mother frequently berated his father for not providing the family a better income, as he went from one job to another.  Without success he also tried his hand at such ventures as a furniture retailer and a coat factory.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=5}}  The family situation was especially dire following the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] that marked the beginning of the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=11}}  In 1930, the situation was so desperate that Eisner's mother demanded that he, at thirteen, find some way to contribute to the family's income.  He entered working life selling newspapers on street corners, a competitive job where the toughest boys fought for the best locations.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=12}}

Eisner attended [[DeWitt Clinton High School]]. With influences that included the early 20th-century commercial artist [[J. C. Leyendecker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Cons: New York 1974! | publisher = | work=The Journal Summer Special | year=1974 | editor-first = Paul Kowtiuk | editor-last = Maple Leaf Publications | place = Box 1286, Essex, ON, CA N0R 1E0) | author=Lovece, Frank | authorlink= Frank Lovece}}&lt;/ref&gt; he drew for the [[school newspaper]] (''The Clintonian''), the literary magazine (''The Magpie'') and the [[yearbook]], and did [[stage design]], leading him to consider doing that kind of work for theater. Upon graduation, he studied under Canadian artist [[George Brandt Bridgman]] (1864–1943) for a year at the [[Art Students League of New York]]. Contacts made there led to a position as an advertising writer-[[cartoonist]] for the ''[[New York American]]'' newspaper. Eisner also drew $10-a-page illustrations for [[pulp magazines]], including ''Western Sheriffs and Outlaws''.

In 1936, high-school friend and fellow cartoonist [[Bob Kane]], of future [[Batman]] fame, suggested that the 19-year-old Eisner try selling cartoons to the new comic book ''Wow, What A Magazine!'' "Comic books" at the time were tabloid-sized collections of [[comic strip]] reprints in color. By 1935, they had begun to include occasional new comic strip-like material. ''Wow'' editor [[Jerry Iger]] bought an Eisner adventure strip called ''Captain Scott Dalton'', an [[H. Rider Haggard]]-styled hero who traveled the world after rare artifacts. Eisner subsequently wrote and drew the [[pirate]] strip "The Flame" and the [[secret agent]] strip "Harry Karry" for ''Wow'' as well.

Eisner said that on one occasion a man who Eisner described as "a [[Mafia|Mob]] type straight out of [[Damon Runyon]], complete with pinkie ring, broken nose, black shirt, and white tie, who claimed to have "exclusive distribution rights for all [[Brooklyn]]" asked Eisner to draw [[Tijuana bible]]s for $3 a page. Eisner said that he declined the offer; he described the decision as "one of the most difficult moral decisions of my life".&lt;ref name="Spiegelman2"&gt;[[Art Spiegelman|Spiegelman, Art]].

==Eisner &amp; Iger==
{{Main|Eisner &amp; Iger}}

''Wow'' lasted four issues (cover-dated July–September and November 1936). After it ended, Eisner and Iger worked together producing and selling original comics material, anticipating that the well of available reprints would soon run dry, though their accounts of how their partnership was founded differ. One of the first such comic-book "packagers", their partnership was an immediate success, and the two soon had a stable of comics creators supplying work to [[Fox Comics]], [[Fiction House]], [[Quality Comics]] (for whom Eisner co-created such characters as [[Doll Man]] and [[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawk]]), and others.
Turning a profit of $1.50 a page, Eisner claimed that he "got very rich before I was 22,"&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, Marilyn, "The Only Real Middle-Class Crimefighter," ''New York'' (Sunday supplement, ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]''), January 9, 1966; reprinted ''Alter Ego'' No. 48, May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; later detailing that in [[Great Depression|Depression-era]] 1939 alone, he and Iger "had split $25,000 between us",&lt;ref&gt;Heintjes, Tom, ''The Spirit: The Origin Years'' #3 (Kitchen Sink Press, September 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; a considerable amount for the time.

Among the studio's products was a self-syndicated Sunday comic strip, ''Hawks of the Sea'', that initially reprinted Eisner's old strip ''Wow, What A Magazine!'' feature "The Flame" and then continued it with new material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://toonopedia.com/hawkseas.htm ''Hawks of the Sea''] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/66BzKll86 Archived] from the original on March 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Eisner's original work even crossed the Atlantic, with Eisner drawing the new cover of the October 16, 1937 issue of [[Boardman Books]]' comic-strip reprint tabloid ''Okay Comics Weekly.''{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In 1939, Eisner was commissioned to create [[Wonder Man (Fox Publications)|Wonder Man]] for [[Fox Publications#Victor Fox|Victor Fox]], an accountant who had previously worked at [[DC Comics]] and was becoming a comic book publisher himself. Following Fox's instructions to create a [[Superman]]-type character, and using the pen name Willis, Eisner wrote and drew the first issue of ''Wonder Comics.'' Eisner said in interviews throughout his later life that he had protested the derivative nature of the character and story, and that when subpoenaed after [[National Periodical Publications]], the company that would evolve into [[DC Comics]], sued Fox, alleging Wonder Man was an illegal copy of Superman, Eisner testified that this was so, undermining Fox's case;&lt;ref name=spirited44-45&gt;Andelman, Bob. ''Will Eisner: A Spirited Life'' (M Press: [[Milwaukie, Oregon]], 2005) {{ISBN|978-1-59582-011-2}}, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; Eisner even depicts himself doing so in his semi-autobiographical graphic novel ''[[The Dreamer (graphic novel)|The Dreamer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Dreamer (graphic novel)|The Dreamer: A Graphic Novella Set During the Dawn of Comic Books]]'' ([[DC Comics]] : New York City, 1986 edition) {{ISBN|978-1-56389-678-1}}.

[[File:TheSpiritNo21.jpg|260px|thumb|Eisner's cover for ''The Spirit'', Oct 6, 1946.]]
In "late '39, just before Christmas time," Eisner recalled in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;"Art &amp; Commerce: An Oral Reminiscence by Will Eisner." ''Panels'' #1 (Summer 1979), pp. 5–21, quoted in {{cite web|last=Quattro|first= Ken|url= http://www.comicartville.com/rareeisner.htm |title=Rare Eisner: Making of a Genius| publisher=Comicartville Library |year= 2003| archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5mAYF8MXe |archivedate=December 20, 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quality Comics publisher [[Everett M. "Busy" Arnold]] "came to me and said that the Sunday newspapers were looking for a way of getting into this comic book boom," In a 2004 interview,&lt;ref name="ae48"&gt;Will Eisner interview, ''Alter Ego'' No. 48 (May 2005), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; he elaborated on that meeting:
{{blockquote|"Busy" invited me up for lunch one day and introduced me to Henry Martin [sales manager of [[The Des Moines Register|The Des Moines Register and Tribune Syndicate]], who] said, "The newspapers in this country, particularly the Sunday papers, are looking to compete with comics books, and they would like to get a comic-book insert into the newspapers." ... Martin asked if I could do it. ... It meant that I'd have to leave Eisner &amp; Iger [which] was making money; we were very profitable at that time and things were going very well. A hard decision. Anyway, I agreed to do the Sunday comic book and we started discussing the deal [which] was that we'd be partners in the 'Comic Book Section,' as they called it at that time. And also, I would produce two other magazines in partnership with Arnold.}}

Eisner negotiated an agreement with the syndicate in which Arnold would copyright ''The Spirit,'' but, "Written down in the contract I had with 'Busy' Arnold&amp;nbsp;— and this contract exists today as the basis for my copyright ownership&amp;nbsp;— Arnold agreed that it was my property. They agreed that if we had a split-up in any way, the property would revert to me on that day that happened. My attorney went to 'Busy' Arnold and his family, and they all signed a release agreeing that they would not pursue the question of ownership".&lt;ref name="ae48" /&gt; This would include the eventual backup features "[[Mr. Mystic]]" and "[[Lady Luck (comics)|Lady Luck]]".

"They gave me an adult audience", Eisner said in 1997, "and I wanted to write better things than superheroes. Comic books were a ghetto. I sold my part of the enterprise to my associate and then began The Spirit. They wanted an heroic character, a costumed character. They asked me if he'd have a costume. And I put a mask on him and said, 'Yes, he has a costume!'"&lt;ref&gt;Will Eisner interview, [http://www.twomorrows.com/kirby/articles/16eisner.html ''Jack Kirby Collector'' #16 (June 1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Spirit'', an initially eight- and later seven-page urban-crimefighter series, ran with the initial backup features "Mr. Mystic" and "Lady Luck" in a 16-page Sunday supplement (colloquially called "The Spirit Section") that was eventually distributed in 20 newspapers with a combined circulation of as many as five million copies.&lt;ref&gt;Eisner, ''The Dreamer'', "About the Author", p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered June 2, 1940, and continued through 1952.&lt;ref name=gcd1940series&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series/10295/|title=GCD :: Series :: The Spirit|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisner has cited the Spirit story "Gerhard Shnobble" as a particular favorite, as it was one of his first attempts at injecting his personal point of view into the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartoonician.com/eisner-wide-open/|title=Eisner Wide Open|work=Hogan's Alley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II and ''Joe Dope''==

[[File:PSJune1951.jpg|thumb|Premiere issue of the [[U.S. Army]] publication ''[[PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly|PS]]'' (June 1951), designed to be a "postscript" to related publications. Art by Eisner.]]
Eisner was [[military conscription|drafted]] into the [[U.S. Army]] in "late '41, early '42"&lt;ref name=tcj46p45&gt;"Will Eisner Interview", ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' No. 46 (May 1979), p. 45. Interview conducted October 13 and 17, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; and then "had about another half-year which the government gave me to clean up my affairs before going off" to fight in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=tcj46p37&gt;Eisner interview, ''The Comics Journal'' No. 46, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned to the camp newspaper at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], where "there was also a big training program there, so I got involved in the use of comics for training. ... I finally became a [[Warrant Officer (United States)|warrant officer]], which involved taking a test – that way you didn't have to go through [[Officer Candidate School]]."&lt;ref name=tcj46p45 /&gt;

En route to Washington, D.C., he stopped at the [[Fort Holabird|Holabird Ordnance Depot]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], where a [[mimeograph]]ed publication titled ''Army Motors'' was put together. "Together with the people there ... I helped develop its format. I began doing cartoons – and we began fashioning a magazine that had the ability to talk to the [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]]s in their language. So I began to use comics as a teaching tool, and when I got to Washington, they assigned me to the business of teaching – or selling – preventive maintenance."&lt;ref name=tcj46pp45-46&gt;Eisner interview, ''The Comics Journal'' No. 46, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisner then created the educational comic strip and titular character ''Joe Dope'' for ''Army Motors'', and spent four years working in [[The Pentagon]] editing the [[wikt:ordnance|ordnance]] magazine ''Firepower'' and doing "all the general illustrations – that is, cartoons" for ''Army Motors''. He continued to work on that and its 1950 successor magazine, ''[[PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly]]'' until 1971.&lt;ref name=tcj46pp45-46 /&gt; Eisner also illustrated an official Army pamphlet in 1968 and 1969 called ''The M16A1 Rifle'' specifically for troops in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] to help minimize the [[M-16 rifle]]'s notorious early reliability problems with proper maintenance. Eisner's style helped to popularize these officially-distributed works in order to better educate soldiers on equipment maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_M16A1_Rifle.html?id=RyzonQEACAAJ |title=The M16A1 Rifle: Operation and Preventive Maintenance |author1=[[United States Department of the Army]] |author2=Robert A. Sadowski |publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing]] |date=2013 |accessdate=2014-07-13 |isbn=9781616088644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=[[Lincoln Journal Star]]|url=http://journalstar.com/entertainment/arts-and-culture/books/unl-professor-s-new-book-explores-the-weird-world-of/article_f153acdc-1aa3-50cd-a0e1-edf49148e8d3.html|title=UNL professor's new book explores the weird world of government comics|date=November 5, 2011|first=Micah|last=Mertes|quote=Will Eisner should be credited for using sequences of cartoon images to teach people how to do things, rather than merely as a way to dramatize a story or illustrate text. One of the last military projects he worked on dealt with the use and care of the problematic M16 rifle. The weapon was issued in the mid-'60s to great fanfare but soon developed a reputation for unreliability. Full of double entendres, ''Operation and Preventive Maintenance The M16A1 Rifle'' is a classic example of Eisner's incredible ability to combine effectively informational/instructional design with graphic design.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Eisner's later graphic novels were entirely his own work, he had a studio working under his supervision on ''The Spirit''. In particular, [[letterer]] [[Abe Kanegson]] came up with the distinctive lettering style which Eisner himself would later imitate in his book-length works, and Kanegson would often rewrite Eisner's dialogue.&lt;ref name="sim1"&gt;[[Dave Sim|Sim, Dave]], "My Dinner With Will &amp; Other Stories," ''Following Cerebus'' No. 4 (May 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisner's most trusted assistant on ''The Spirit,'' however, was [[Jules Feiffer]], later a renowned cartoonist, playwright and screenwriter in his own right. Eisner later said of their working methods "You should hear me and Jules Feiffer going at it in a room. 'No, you designed the splash page for this one, then you wrote the ending&amp;nbsp;— I came up with the idea for the story, and you did it up to this point, then I did the next page and this sequence here and...' And I'll be swearing up and down that 'he' wrote the ending on that one. We never agree".&lt;ref name="sim1" /&gt;

So trusted were Eisner's assistants that Eisner allowed them to "ghost" ''The Spirit'' from the time that he was drafted into the [[U.S. Army]] in 1942 until his return to civilian life in 1945. The primary wartime artists were the uncredited [[Lou Fine]] and [[Jack Cole (artist)|Jack Cole]], with future ''[[Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'' artist [[Jack Keller (comics)|Jack Keller]] drawing backgrounds. Ghost writers included [[Manly Wade Wellman]] and [[William Woolfolk]]. The wartime ghosted stories have been reprinted in [[DC Comics]]' hardcover collections ''The Spirit Archives'' Vols. 5 to 11 (2001–2003), spanning July 1942 – December 1944.

==Post-war comics==

On Eisner's return from service and resumption of his role in the studio, he created the bulk of the ''Spirit'' stories on which his reputation was solidified. The post-war years also saw him attempt to launch the comic-strip/comic-book series ''Baseball,'' ''John Law,'' ''Kewpies,'' and ''Nubbin the Shoeshine Boy;'' none succeeded, but some material was recycled into ''The Spirit''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

''The Spirit'' ceased publishing in 1952. During the 1960s and 1970s, various publishers  reprinted the adventures often with covers by Eisner and with a few new stories from him.

==American Visuals Corporation==
During his World War II military service, Eisner had introduced the use of comics for training personnel in the publication ''Army Motors'', for which he created the cautionary bumbling soldier Joe Dope, who illustrated various methods of [[preventive maintenance]] of various military equipment and weapons. In 1948, while continuing to do ''The Spirit'' and seeing television and other post-war trends eat at the readership base of newspapers, he formed the American Visuals Corporation in order to produce instructional materials for the government, related agencies, and businesses.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010}}

One of his longest-running jobs was ''[[PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly]],'' a [[digest size]]d magazine with comic book elements that he started for the Army in 1951 and continued to work on until the 1970s with [[Klaus Nordling]], [[Mike Ploog]], and other artists. In addition, Eisner produced other military publications such as the graphic manual in 1969, ''[http://www.ep.tc/problems/25/index.html The M-16A1 Rifle: Operation and Preventative Maintenance]'', which was distributed along with cleaning kits to address serious reliability concerns with the [[M16 Rifle]] during the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Schumacher|2010}}

Other clients of his Connecticut-based company included [[RCA Records]], the [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] [[NFL]] [[American football|football]] team, and [[New York Telephone]].

==Graphic novels==
[[File:Contractwithgod.png|thumb|[[Trade paperback (comics)|Trade paperback]] edition of ''A Contract with God''; the concurrent 1,500-copy hardcover release did not use the term "graphic novel" on its cover.]]
In the late 1970s, Eisner turned his attention to longer storytelling forms. ''[[A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories]]'' (Baronet Books, October 1978) is an early example of an American graphic novel, combining thematically linked short stories into a single square-bound volume. Eisner continued with a string of graphic novels that tell the history of New York's immigrant communities, particularly [[Jew]]s, including ''[[The Building (comics)|The Building]]'', ''A Life Force'', ''Dropsie Avenue'' and ''To the Heart of the Storm''. He continued producing new books into his seventies and eighties, at an average rate of nearly one a year. Each of these books was done twice&amp;nbsp;— once as a rough version to show editor Dave Schreiner, then as a second, finished version incorporating suggested changes.&lt;ref&gt;Sim, Dave, "Advice &amp; Consent: The Editing of Graphic Novels" (panel discussion with Eisner and [[Chester Brown]]) and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] interview, both ''Following Cerebus'' No. 5 (August 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his last work was the retelling in [[sequential art]] of novels and [[Mythology|myth]]s, including ''[[Moby-Dick]]''. In 2002, at the age of 85, he published ''[[Epic of Sundiata|Sundiata]]'', based on the part-historical, part-mythical stories of a West African king, "The Lion of [[Mali]]". ''[[Fagin the Jew]]'' is an account of the life of Dickens' character Fagin, in which Eisner tries to get past the stereotyped portrait of Fagin in ''[[Oliver Twist]]''.

His last graphic novel, ''The Plot: The Secret Story of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'', an account of the making, and refutation, of the [[anti-semitic]] [[hoax]] ''[[The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]]'', was completed shortly before his death and published in 2005.

In 2008, Will Eisner's ''The Spirit: A Pop-Up Graphic Novel'' was published, with [[Bruce Foster]] as paper engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacDonald|first1=Heidi|title=When the Gift is a Graphic Novel|journal=PublishersWeekly.com|date=Oct 20, 2008|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/11219-when-the-gift-is-a-graphic-novel.html|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==

In his later years especially, Eisner was a frequent lecturer about the craft and uses of sequential art. He taught at the [[School of Visual Arts]] in New York City, where he published ''Will Eisner's Gallery'', a collection of work by his students&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/930648436|title=Will Eisner : champion of the graphic novel|last=Levitz|first=Paul|publisher=Abrams|others=|year=2015|isbn=9781613128640|location=New York|pages=|oclc=930648436}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote two books based on these lectures, ''[[Comics and Sequential Art]]'' and ''[[Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative]]'', which are widely used by students of cartooning. In 2002, Eisner participated in the Will Eisner Symposium of the 2002 University of Florida Conference on Comics and Graphic Novels.&lt;ref&gt;Eisner, Will.

Until then, only Eisner's closest friends were aware of his daughter's life and death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5109">{{more footnotes|date=August 2016}}'''Worship dance''' is any kind of [[dance]] that is undertaken for the specific purpose of religious [[worship]].

As a basic element of human expression, [[dance]] is found within many of the world's [[religion]]s, and is frequently associated with [[worship]]. However, use of the term '''worship dance''' appears to be restricted to [[Christianity]] and [[Messianic Judaism]].

==Christianity==
[[Dance]] has had a chequered history within [[Christianity]]. Many records exist of prohibitions by leaders within most branches of the [[Christian Church]], for such reasons as the association of dance with [[paganism]], fears relating to sexuality, and a Greek-influenced belief in the separation of soul and body.

However, beginning in the latter half of the 20th century there was a significant growth in the use of dance within [[Christian worship]]. This received a boost within the framework of the [[charismatic movement]] of the 1970s, which initiated a transition to [[contemporary worship]] in many churches.

==Hinduism==
[[Image:classical indian dance 8.jpg|right|260px|thumb|Classical Indian dance]]
From a Hindu point of view, the whole Universe is being brought into existence as the manifestation of the dance of the Supreme Dancer, [[Nataraja]]. In the Hindu scriptures every god has his or her own style ([[lasya]] and [[tandava]] respectively represent two aspects of dance). We read about 23 celestial beings called [[Apsara]]s who dance to please the gods and express the supreme truths in the magic of movement.

The dance in Hinduism used to be a part of a sacred temple ritual, especially in South and Eastern India, where the female priestesses [[devadasi]]'s worshipped different aspects of the Divine through the elaborate language of mime and gestures. [[Natyashastra]] is the most ancient and the most elaborate scripture describing every element and aspect of this sacred art-worship.

The temple dance gradually evolved into what is known today as the South Indian Classical Dance that still preserves many ritualistic elements of Hinduism. Some of the [[classical Indian dance]]rs are believed to be incarnations of apsaras.

[[File:Tari Pendet.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Pendet dancers hold silver bowl of flowers.]]
'''Pendet''' is a traditional dance from [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]], in which floral offerings are made to purify the temple or theater as a prelude to ceremonies or other dances. Pendet is typically performed by young girls, carrying bowls of flower petals, handfuls of which are cast into the air at various times in the dance. Pendet can be thought of as a dance of greeting, to welcome the audience and invite spirits to enjoy a performance.&lt;ref name="BaliNOW"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nowbali.co.id/pendet-a-beautiful-welcoming-dance/|title=Pendet: A Beautiful Welcoming Dance - NOW! Bali|date=2015-12-09|work=NOW! Bali|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pendet can be divided into two types, the sacred dances called ''Wali'' and entertainment dances called ''Bebalihan''. ''Wali'' (sacred dances) are usually performed only during certain ritual ceremonies. [[Balinese Hinduism|Balinese Hindus]] believed that the sacred dances has strong religious significance and spiritual power, thus only can be performed during specific religious ceremony by specific dancers. ''Bebalihan'' are usually performed in social events. In addition to entertain, ''Bebalihan'' also has other purposes including welcoming guests, celebration of harvests, or gathering crowds. ''Bebalihan'' has more variations than ''Wali''. Pendet is considered as a form of ''Bebalihan'', often performed secularly to welcome guests or audiences. Pendet believed as a representation of Balinese floral offering ritual, which offered ''banten'' or ''canang'' (floral offerings) from shrine to shrine within [[Balinese temple]] or residential compounds. Initially, Pendet dance is used as a complement of ''piodalan'' ceremonies in temples or family shrines, as a symbol of gratitude, respect, and joy when welcoming the presence of the gods who descend from ''khayangan'' (realm of gods).

==Judaism==
A distinctive style of worship dance has developed within [[Messianic Judaism]]. Known as ''messianic dance'' or ''davidic dance'' (named after [[King David]], who famously danced before the [[Ark of the Covenant]]), it takes a similar form to [[Israeli Folk Dancing]]. And there also is a dance known as Lippo dancing that was originated in the late 1800's by a handsome , clever man known as Chevaughn Rowe III, who later became a wealthy astronomer and mathematician.

{{wikisource|Kitêba Cilwe}}

The '''''Yazidi Book of Revelation''''' (''Kitêba Cilwe'' in [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]]; also transliterated as ''Kitab Al Jilwah'') is one of two books on the [[Yazidi]] religion written in the style of a holy book in the [[Kurmanji]] dialect of the [[Northern Kurdish]] language, the other being the ''[[Yazidi Black Book]]'' (''Mishefa Reş'' in Kurdish).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford encyclopedia of the modern Islamic world |last=Esposito |first=John L., ed. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that the original text of the ''Book of Revelation'' is kept in the Yazidi village of [[Ba'idn]] and the original text of the ''Yazidi Black Book'' is kept in the village of [[Qasr 'tzz at-Din]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Survival Among the Kurds: A History of the Yezidis |last=Guest |first=John S |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1993 |publisher=Kegan Paul International |location=London |isbn=0-7103-0456-0 |page=154n |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars generally agree that the ''Book of Revelation'' and the ''Black Book'', which were published in English translation in 1911 and 1913, respectively, "are 'forgeries' in the sense they were written by non-Yazidis in response to Western travelers’ and scholars’ interest in the Yazidi religion". Nonetheless they do reflect authentic Yazidi traditions.&lt;ref name=iryez&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/yazidis-i-general-1 Encyclopaedia Iranica:Yazidis]&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual core texts of the religion that exist today are the hymns known as ''qewl''.&lt;ref name=iryez/&gt;

== Chapters ==
The ''Book of Revelation'' contains five chapters in order of decreasing length. In all five chapters of this book, the words of God are given in the first person, in contrast to the ''Black Book'', which records the acts of God in the third person.

* Chapter one of the ''Book of Revelation'' discusses the Yazidi doctrine of the [[nature of God]], who is made to declare that he is the author of what "outsiders call evils". The rest of the chapter deals with the exercise of [[omnipotence|divine power]].
* Chapter two describes the [[omnipotence]] of God.
* Chapter three treats of the omnipotence of God, and begins with the statement that God guides without a [[scripture]].
* Chapter four contains a warning against outsiders, and enunciates a doctrine concerning the "corruption" of holy books very similar to that of the [[Muslim]]s.
* Chapter five is a short [[wikt:exhortation|exhortation]] to the faithful.

'''Yuanshi Tianzun''' ({{zh|c=元始天尊|p=Yuánshǐ Tīanzūn}}), the ''Celestial Venerable of the Primordial Beginning'' or the ''Primeval Lord of Heaven'', is one of the highest deities of religious [[Taoism]]. He is one of the [[Three Pure Ones]] ({{zh|c=三清|p=Sānqīng}}), and is also known as the ''Jade Pure One'' ({{zh|c=玉清|p=Yùqīng}}). He resides in the Heaven of Jade Purity. It is believed that he came into being at the beginning of the universe as a result of the merging of pure breaths. He then created Heaven and Earth.

==In Taoist mythology==
He once was the supreme administrator of Heaven but later entrusted that task to his assistant ''Yuhuang'', the [[Jade Emperor]]. Yuhuang took over the administrative duties of Yuanshi Tianzun, and became the overseer of both Heaven and Earth. At the beginning of each age, Yuanshi Tianzun transports the [[List of Lingbao texts|''Lingpao ching'']] (or "Yuanshi Ching"), the Scriptures of the Magic Jewel, to his students (who are lesser deities), who in turn instruct mankind in the teachings of the [[Tao]].

Yuanshi Tianzun is said to be without beginning and the most supreme of all beings. He is in fact, a representation of the principle of all being. From him all things arose. He is eternal, limitless, and without form.

==Role in ''Fengshen Yanyi''==
In the ''[[Investiture of the Gods]]'', Yuanshi Tianzun is a superior man who has maintained his will for generations. He would be known as the master of the [[Kunlun Mountains]], in which he had many disciples—one of such being [[Jiang Ziya]]. In time, Yuanshi Tianzun would tell Jiang that it would be time to head down to the world in order to attain a level of wealth and honor. Because Jiang Ziya was destined to assist in the creation of the new [[Zhou dynasty]]—as like [[Nezha]]—Yuanshi Tianzun would stay loyal to heaven's will and effectively send Jiang away to his new destiny. After telling Jiang what to do through a poetic format, Yuanshi Tianzun says his final words of farewell to his student.

==Worship==
Taoists claim that sacrifices offered to Yuanshi Tianzun by the king predate the [[Xia dynasty]]. The [[Oracle bone#Discovery|surviving archaeological record]] shows that by the [[Shang dynasty]], the [[scapula|shoulder blades]] of sacrificed oxen were used to send questions or communication through fire and smoke to the divine realm, a practice known as [[scapulimancy]]. The heat would cause the bones to crack and royal diviners would interpret the marks as Yuanshi Tianzun's response to the king. Inscriptions used for divination were buried into special orderly pits, while those that were for practice or records were buried in common [[midden]]s after use.&lt;ref&gt;Xu Yahui. Caltonhill, Mark &amp; al., trans. ''Ancient Chinese Writing: Oracle Bone Inscriptions from the Ruins of Yin.'' Academia Sinica. Nat'l Palace Museum (Taipei), 2002. Govt. Publ. No. 1009100250.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Yuanshi Tianzun or his later names, the deity received sacrifices from the ruler of China in every Chinese dynasty annually at a great [[Temple of Heaven]] in the imperial capital. Following the principles of [[fengshui|Chinese geomancy]], this would always be located in the southern quarter of the city.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the Classic of History records the Duke of Zhou building an altar in the southern part of Luo.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the ritual, a completely healthy bull would be slaughtered and presented as an animal sacrifice to Yuanshi Tianzun.&lt;ref&gt;Although the Duke of Zhou is presented as sacrificing two.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Rites]] states the sacrifice should occur on the "[[summer solstice|longest day]]" on a round-mound altar.{{clarify|date=October 2012}} The altar would have three tiers: the highest for Yuanshi Tianzun and the [[Son of Heaven]]; the second-highest for the sun and moon; and the lowest for the natural gods such as the stars, clouds, rain, wind, and thunder.

It is important to note that Yuanshi Tianzun is never represented with either images or idols. Instead, in the center building of the Temple of Heaven, in a structure called the "Imperial Vault of Heaven", a "spirit tablet" (神位, or shénwèi) inscribed with the name of Yuanshi Tianzun is stored on the throne, ''Huangtian Shangdi'' (皇天上帝). During an annual sacrifice, the emperor would carry these tablets to the north part of the Temple of Heaven, a place called the "Prayer Hall For Good Harvests", and place them on that throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsdj.com/luyou/tp2/BJTT12.jpg|title=JSDJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
