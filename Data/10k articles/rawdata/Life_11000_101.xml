'''Abd-al-Masih''' (or '''Abda''') is the name of two [[Christian]] [[martyr]]s of the [[Middle Ages]]. 

One, of unknown date but later canonised as a [[saint]], was a [[religious conversion|converted]] [[Jew]]ish shepherd boy (known as Aser) who was killed by his father for his faith. The story is set in [[Singara]] and is a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] text with later versions in Arabic and Armenian.&lt;ref&gt;This text was the subject of the PhD thesis of Michael L. Morris, University of Southampton, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He lived near [[Sinjar]] in the Persian Empire. Having been converted to Christianity he pierced his ear to wear earring (probably indication of his slavery). &lt;ref&gt;[http://syriaca.org/person/1102#bib1102-2/ Abdelmasih - ‹•‹í‹ï‹ê‹†‹°‹£‹ù‹ö] Retrieved on 7 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt;. He died in 390 AD. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syriacstudies.com/AFSS/Syriac_Articles_in_English/Entries/2008/3/18_The_Lives_of_the_Martyrs_of_Edessa,_Samosata_and_Persia_-_Mor_Ignatius_Aphram_Barsoum.html/ The Lives of the Martyrs of Edessa, Samosata and Persia] Retrieved on 7 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt;There is disagreement about the location of his martyrdom. Some sources say [[Singar]] (in modern [[Iraq]] near the Syrian border), and others say [[Taglibis]] in Arabia. He is regarded as the [[patron saint]] of sterile women in Syria, and has his feast day observed on July 13, and July 22 or October 3.&lt;ref&gt;Holweck, F. G. ''A Biographical Dictionary of the Saints''. St. Louis, MO: B. Herder Book Co., 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another medieval martyr was 'Abd al-Masih, also known as '''Qays al-Ghassani'''. He died in the 9th century, during a wave of conversions to [[Islam]]. His death was recorded in a 10th-century manuscript now belonging to [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Obscure+text,+illuminating+conversation:+reading+The+Martyrdom+of...-a0186594231 Obscure text, illuminating conversation: reading The Martyrdom of 'Abd al-Masih (Qays al-Ghassani)].&lt;/ref&gt;

The only information known about him is derived from two passages in [[Josephus]]'s ''[[Against Apion]]'', i.17 and i.18.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gam10TAOZusC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;lpg=PA162&amp;dq=Abibaal+Tyre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AU14XrCU5N&amp;sig=mdmszxfobnV-sYqZWXNb8dRrEek&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result#PPA162,M1 Lowell K. Handy, ''The Age of Solomon'' (Leiden: Brill, 1997) 162]&lt;/ref&gt; All that is said in these passages is that he preceded his son Hiram on the throne of Tyre. Neither his length of reign nor his immediate predecessors are known. The dating of Abibaal is therefore dependent on the dates assigned to his son, and here it is only the date of Abibaal's death that can be determined, based on the information preserved in Josephus regarding the length of time between the founding of Carthage (or from Dido's flight from Tyre) until the first year of Hiram. See the [[Hiram I]] article for details on the determination of this date.

Elements of his ''KitƒÅb Sirr al-'Amal'', "Book of the secret action", are also reproduced in the 12th century ''Book of Nine Judges'', compiled by [[Hugo of Santalla]].

[[File:RAMmummy.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mummy]] of Ramesses II&lt;ref&gt;[[Ramesses II]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''S≈´rat an-NƒÅzi ªƒÅt''' ({{lang-ar|ÿ≥Ÿàÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßÿ≤ÿπÿßÿ™}}, ‚ÄúThose Who Pull Out‚Äù, in reference to ‚Äúthe angels who tear out the souls of the wicked‚Äù) is the seventy-ninth sura of the [[Qur'an]] with 46 [[ayat]]. Its name derived from the word ''wan-nazi‚Äòat'' with which it opens. The root (n-z-‚Äò) roughly means ‚Äúto yank out with great force‚Äù,&lt;ref&gt;Tafsir; [https://tafseerstudy.wordpress.com/juzz-amma/79-an-naziat/79-an-naziat/ ‚ÄòAn-Nazi‚Äòat‚Äô]&lt;/ref&gt; although it can also mean ‚Äúto yearn for‚Äù or ‚Äúto yearn after‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Maulana Muhammad; ''The Holy Qur'an with English Translation and Commentary'', p. 1138 {{ISBN|091332101X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Period of revelation==
Its subject matter testifies that ''S≈´rat an-NƒÅzi ªƒÅt'' belongs to the earliest period at [[Makkah]]. According to Abdullah bin Abbas, this Surah was sent down before Surah [[An-Naba]], whilst [[Mu·∏•ammad Kha·π≠ƒ´b]] has opined that surah 79 was revealed around five years before the [[Hegira]], although other commentators have dated the surah‚Äôs revelation at eight years before the Hegira.&lt;ref&gt;Kha·π≠ƒ´b, Mu·∏•ammad; ''The Bounteous Koran: A Translation of Meaning and Commentary''&lt;/ref&gt; Western Qur‚Äôan scholar [[Richard Bell (Arabist)|Richard Bell]] has argued that parts of surah 79, notably the opening verses, may date from a later Meccan period,&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Richard (translator); ''The Qur‚Äôan'' (volume 2; p. 633. Published 1937 (reprint 1960) by T. &amp; T. Clark&lt;/ref&gt; though this is not generally accepted by other scholars.

==Theme and subject matter==
Its theme is affirmation of [[Resurrection]] and the life [[hereafter]]. It also warns of the consequences of belying the Messenger of God.

The Surah opens with oaths sworn by the [[angels]] who take the [[soul]] at [[deaths]] and those who hasten to carry out Allah‚Äôs Commands, and those who conduct the affairs of the [[universe]] according to Divine Will, to assure that the [[Resurrection]] will certainly come to pass and the second life after death will certainly take place. For the angels who are employed to pluck out the soul today can also be employed to restore the soul tomorrow, and the angels who promptly execute Allah's Commands and conduct the affairs of the universe today can also upset the order of the universe tomorrow by orders of the same [[God]] and can also bring about a new order.

After this the people have been told, so as to say: ‚ÄúThis work which you regard as absolutely impossible, is not any difficult for [[Allah]], for which He may have to make lengthy preparations. Just a single jolt will upset this system of the world and a second jolt will be enough to cause you to appear as living beings in the new world. At that time the same people who were wont to deny it, would be trembling with fear and seeing with awe struck eyes all that they thought was impossible.

Then, relating the story of the [[Prophet]] [[Moses]] and [[Pharaoh]] briefly (it is the chronologically earliest sura to do this),&lt;ref&gt;Starkovsky, Nicolas; ''The Koran Handbook: An Annotated Translation''&lt;/ref&gt; the people have been warned to the effect: ‚ÄúYou know full well what fate the [[Pharaoh]] met in consequence of belying the Messenger and rejecting the guidance brought by him and endeavoring to defeat his mission by trickery and deceit. If you do not learn any lesson from it and do not change your ways and attitude accordingly, you also will have to meet the same fate.

Then, in vv. 27-13, arguments have been given for the Hereafter and life after death. In this regard, the deniers have been asked the question:"Is your resurrection a more difficult task or the creation of the huge Universe which spreads around you to infinite distances with myriads of its stars and planets? Your recreation cannot be difficult for the God for Whom this was an easy task. Thus, after presenting in a single sentence, a decisive argument for the possibility of the Hereafter, attention has been drawn to the earth and its provisions that have been arranged in it for the sustenance of man and animal and of which everything testifies that it has been created with great wisdom for fulfilling some special purpose. Pointing to this the question has been left for the intellect of man to ponder for itself and form the opinion whether calling man to account after having delegated authority and responsibilities to a creature like him in this wise system would be more in keeping with the demands of wisdom, or that he should die after committing all sorts of misdeeds in the world and should perish and mix in the dust for ever and should never be called to account as to how he employed the authority and fulfilled the responsibilities entrusted to him. Instead of discussing this question, in vv. 34-41, it has been said: "When the Hereafter is established, men's eternal future will be determined on the criterion as to which of them rebelled against his God transgressing the bounds of service and made the material benefits and pleasures his objective of life and which of them feared standing before his Lord and refrained from fulfilling the unlawful desires of the self." This by itself provides the right answer to the above question to every such person who considers it honestly, free from stubbornness. For the only rational, logical and moral demand of giving authority and entrusting responsibilities to man in the world is that he should be called to account on this very basis ultimately and rewarded or punished accordingly.

In conclusion, the question of the disbelievers of Makkah as to when Resurrection will take place, has been answered. They asked the Prophet this question over and over again. In reply it has been said that the knowledge of the time of its occurrence rests with Allah alone. The Messenger is there only to give the warning that it will certainly come. Now whoever wishes may mend his ways, fearing its coming, and whoever wishes may behave and conduct himself as he likes, fearless of its coming. When the appointed time comes, those very people who loved the life of this world and regarded its pleasures as the only object of life, would feel that they had stayed in the world only for an hour or so. Then they will realize how utterly they had ruined their future for ever for the sake of the short lived pleasures of the world.

'''Anna Carolina Reston Macan''' (June 4, 1985 &amp;ndash; November 14, 2006) was a [[Brazil]]ian [[Model (person)|fashion model]].

Reston was born to a middle-class family in [[Jundia√≠]], on the outskirts of [[S√£o Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. At the age of 13, she began her modeling career after winning a local beauty contest in her hometown in 1999. Despite being shorter than the usual model at 1.68 m (5 ft 6 in), she was represented by renowned modeling agencies such as [[Ford Models|Ford]], [[Elite Model Management|Elite]] and [[L'√âquipe]] in countries such as [[China]], [[Turkey]], [[Mexico]], and [[Japan]], and appeared in prestigious [[ad campaign]]s such as [[Giorgio Armani]]. During her career, she listed her height as just over 5 ft 7 in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/jan/14/fashion.features4|title=Anna Carolina Reston: the model who starved herself to death|last=Phillips|first=Tom|date=2007-01-14|website=the Guardian|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2004 Reston made her first overseas trip to [[Guangzhou]],  [[People's Republic of China|China]]. While attending a [[casting (performing arts)|casting call]] there, she was reportedly informed that she was 'too fat', a criticism, it has been said, that led to her decline into [[anorexia nervosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phillips|first1=Tom|title='Everyone knew she was ill. The other girls, the model agencies ... don't believe it when they say they didn't'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/jan/14/fashion.features4|website=The Guardian|accessdate=21 December 2017|date=January 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model's cousin reported that Reston also suffered from [[bulimia nervosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/anorexia-kills-88-pound-brazilian-model-1.624551|title=Anorexia kills 88-pound Brazilian model|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Reston died on Wednesday, November 15th, 2006. At the time of her death, Reston weighed just 40&amp;nbsp;kg (88&amp;nbsp;lbs) at a height of 1.68 m (5&amp;nbsp;ft 6 in), and had been hospitalized since October 25, 2006, for kidney malfunction due to [[anorexia nervosa]] and [[bulimia nervosa]], which included a diet consisting only of [[apple]]s and [[tomato]]es. She had a [[body mass index|body mass index (BMI)]] of only 14.1, well below the index value of 16 which the [[World Health Organization]] considers to be severe thinness.&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.who.int/bmi/index.jsp?introPage=intro_3.html&lt;/ref&gt; Her condition became more serious and deteriorated into generalized [[infection]] that led to her death at the age of 21.

Reston's mother Miriam told the [[Estado de Sao Paulo]] newspaper, "''I noticed something was wrong when she returned from Japan. She was too thin when she returned and when I told her to eat something, she would say:'' '' 'Mom please don't fight with me; there is nothing wrong with me, I'm fine.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/16/AR2006111601392.html Washington Post]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reston was the second model who was reported to have died of anorexia-related complications in 2006, after 22-year-old [[Luisel Ramos]].

The '''Arno''', was a 1,825 ton, [[iron]] [[sailing ship]] with a [[length]] of {{convert|270.7|ft|m}}, breadth of {{convert|39|ft|m}} and depth of {{convert|22.5|ft|m}}. She was built by Charles Connell &amp; Company, [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], for the [[Nourse Line]], named after the [[Arno River]] in central [[Italy]], which flows past [[Florence]] and [[Pisa]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and launched on 19 January 1893. She was primarily used for the transportation of [[Indian indenture system|Indian indentured labourers]] to the colonies. Details of some of these voyages are as follows:
&lt;div align=center&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

In 1896 she was grounded at [[West Hartlepool]], inward bound under tow from [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]].

''Arno'' was sold to [[Norway|Norwegian]] owners in 1910. On 10 October 1913 she left [[Fredrikstad]] for [[Pernambuco]] and was not seen or heard from again.

A '''bond vigilante''' is a [[bond (finance)|bond]] market investor who protests monetary or fiscal policies they consider inflationary by selling bonds, thus increasing [[Yield (finance)|yields]].&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;May 29, 2009. [http://bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a6eMpGVUDeeE&amp;refer=home Bloomberg - Bond Vigilantes Confront Obama as Housing Falters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123033802/http://bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a6eMpGVUDeeE&amp;refer=home |date=January 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the [[bond market]], prices move inversely to yields.  When investors perceive that inflation risk or credit risk is rising they demand higher yields to compensate for the added risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investmentrarities.com/thebestofrr04-29-04.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430095009/http://www.investmentrarities.com/thebestofrr04-29-04.html |archivedate=2008-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, bond prices fall and yields rise, which increases the net cost of borrowing. The term references the ability of the bond market to serve as a restraint on the government's ability to over-spend and over-borrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-bond-vigilantes-return-or-bad-ideas-never-die-2017-01-11 |title=Don‚Äôt expect the bond vigilantes to do the Fed‚Äôs work |date=January 11, 2017 |author=Caroline Baum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
===Clinton administration===
From October 1993 to November 1994 US 10-year yields climbed from 5.2% to just over 8.0% fueled by concerns about federal spending in what became informally known as the "[[Great Bond Massacre]]".  With some guidance from [[Robert Rubin]], the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], the Clinton Administration and Congress made an effort to reduce the deficit.  10-year yields dropped to approximately 4% by November 1998.&lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt; 

Clinton political adviser [[James Carville]] said at the time that ‚ÄúI used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a .400 baseball hitter. But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody." &lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt;

===Obama administration===
During the Obama administration some suggest that bond vigilantes were making a return with worries over sustainability and budgetary responsibility.  Mark MacQueen, a partner and money manager at Austin, Texas-based Sage Advisory Services Ltd., said ‚ÄúThe vigilante group is different this time around.  It‚Äôs major foreign creditors. This whole idea that we need to spend our way out of our problems is being questioned."&lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt; However, economist [[Paul Krugman]] and other [[New Keynesian]]s pointed out that there was no evidence for bond vigilante activity by pointing out the fact that 10-year yields remained quite low.&lt;ref name="krugman"&gt;https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/invisible-bond-vigilantes/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eurozone==
During the [[Eurozone crisis]] that started in 2009, bond vigilantes were blamed for pushing up the government borrowing in the [[PIIGS]] countries.  However Ed Yardini, who coined the term Bond Vigilantes in the 1980s, said that actions of central banks were able to keep rates low against the pressure of the vigilantes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DQHLqhM2uA |title=Ed Yardeni: "Bond Vigilantes" Get to Work in the Eurozone |publisher=NZZ Capital Markets forum |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bruno''', also called '''Brun''' or '''Braun''' ({{circa|830/840}} {{ndash}} 2 February 880), a member of the [[Ottonian dynasty]], was [[List of rulers of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]] from 866 until his death. He is rated as an ancestor of the [[Brunonids]], a cadet branch of the Ottonians, though an affiliation is uncertain. Bruno was killed fighting against [[Norsemen|Norse]] warriors in the [[Battle of Luneberg Heath|Battle of Luneburg Heath]] and is venerated as one of the [[Martyrs of Ebsdorf|Ebsdorf Martyrs]].

==Life==
He was the eldest son of the Saxon count [[Liudolf, Duke of Saxony|Liudolf]] (died 866) and his wife, Oda of [[Billung]]. His father held large estates in [[Eastphalia]] along the [[Leine]] river, where in 852 he founded the [[Gandersheim Abbey|Brunshausen]] monastery. Bruno succeeded his father and is mentioned as a count in 877. 

While Liudolf is described as ''[[dux]] orientalis Saxonum'', i.e. leader in East Saxony (Eastphalia), it is possible that Bruno, according to the ''[[Res gestae saxonicae sive annalium libri tres|Res gestae saxonicae]]'' by the medieval chronicler [[Widukind of Corvey]], already was ''dux totius Saxonum'', duke (''[[Herzog]]'') of all Saxony. The rise of his family in [[East Francia]] is documented by the fact that Bruno's sister [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 885)|Liutgard]] in 874 married the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] prince [[Louis the Younger]], second son of King [[Louis the German]], whereafter he is called ''ducem et fratrem rein√¶'', "duke and the queen's brother" in the ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]''. Nothing is known of Bruno's marriage and children.

He supported his brother-in-law Louis the Younger in the fights with his uncle, Emperor [[Charles the Bald]]. As Saxon commander-in-chief during the [[Viking expansion|Viking invasions]], he died, along with several other noblemen, in a battle against "Norsemen" warriors (probably a [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] contingent of the [[Great Heathen Army]], defeated by King [[Alfred the Great]]) on [[Candlemas]] Day, 2 February 880.&lt;ref&gt;AF, 880 (p. 88 and n4).&lt;/ref&gt; The mid-winter battle was a crushing defeat; Duke Bruno, the bishops of [[Bishopric of Minden|Minden]] and [[Bishopric of Hildesheim|Hildesheim]], as well as twelve Saxon counts and several other noblemen were killed. According to the chronicler Bishop [[Thietmar of Merseburg]], Bruno died in a flooded river, which probably took place during the battle or a retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno, son of Liudolf, died in one of two battles (one at the river [[Scheldt]] and one in Saxony) which are reported separately in the ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]''. The ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'' lists "Bardonum‚Ä¶alterum Bardonum [et] tertium Bardonum" as three of the twelve counts who were killed fighting the Danes in 880[120]. The other two counts named "Bardo" or "Bruno" have not been identified.&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by his younger brother [[Otto I, Duke of Saxony|Otto the Illustrious]], whose son [[Henry the Fowler]] became [[List of German monarchs|King of East Francia]] in 919.

==Veneration==
[[File:Ebstorf-Klosterkirche-1168.jpg|thumb|Ebstorf Abbey]]
Bruno is venerated as a [[saint]] and martyr in the [[Catholic Church]], being honored with a feast day on 2 February under the name '''St. Bruno of Saxony'''. About 1160 his relics were [[Translation (relic)|translated]] by the [[County of Dannenberg|Dannenberg]] counts to [[Ebstorf Abbey]] near [[Uelzen]], which from the 14th century was defined as the place of the 880 battle and became a major [[pilgrimage]] site.

According to tradition, Bruno is also the founder of [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] as well as the ancestor of the local count [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Brun I]] (a candidate in the [[German royal election, 1002|royal election of 1002]]) and his Brunonid descendants. Consistent naming suggests a kinship, however, some mentions appear to refer to an earlier [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] margrave called Brun the Younger, possibly Bruno's grandfather.

'''''Changeling''''' is a 2008 American [[mystery film|mystery]] [[crime drama film]] directed, produced, and scored by [[Clint Eastwood]] and written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]],&lt;ref name="Changeling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/676834/Changeling/full-credits.html |title=Changeling |work=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]]) |location=[[Atlanta]] |accessdate=November 16, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117144744/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/676834/Changeling/full-credits.html |archivedate=November 17, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that explores child endangerment, female disempowerment, political corruption, mistreatment of mental health patients, and the repercussions of violence. The script was based on real-life events, specifically the 1928 [[Wineville Chicken Coop Murders]] in [[Mira Loma, California]]. The film stars [[Angelina Jolie]] as a woman reunited with a boy whom she immediately realizes is not her missing son. When she tries to demonstrate this to the police and city authorities, she is vilified as delusional, labeled as an unfit mother, and then confined to a psychiatric ward.

Straczynski spent a year researching the story after hearing about the Wineville Chicken Coop case from a contact at Los Angeles City Hall. Almost all of the film's script was drawn from thousands of pages of documentation.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Straczynski described 95% of the script as being drawn from around 6,000 pages of documentation.&lt;/ref&gt; His first draft became the [[shooting script]]; it was his first film [[screenplay]] to be produced. [[Ron Howard]] had intended to direct the film, but scheduling conflicts led to his replacement by Eastwood. Howard and his [[Imagine Entertainment]] partner [[Brian Grazer]] produced ''Changeling'' alongside [[Malpaso Productions]]' [[Robert Lorenz]] and Eastwood. [[Universal Pictures]] financed and distributed the film.

Several actors campaigned for the leading role; ultimately, Eastwood decided that Jolie's face would suit the 1920s period setting. The film also stars [[Jeffrey Donovan]], [[Jason Butler Harner]], [[John Malkovich]], [[Michael Kelly (American actor)|Michael Kelly]], and [[Amy Ryan]]. While some characters are [[Composite character|composites]], most are based on actual people. [[Principal photography]], which began on October 15, 2007, and concluded a few weeks later in December, took place in Los Angeles and other locations in [[southern California]]. Actors and crew noted that Eastwood's low-key direction resulted in a calm set and short working days. In [[post-production]], scenes were supplemented with computer-generated skylines, backgrounds, vehicles and people.

''Changeling'' premiered to critical acclaim at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival|61st Cannes Film Festival]] on May 20, 2008. Additional festival screenings preceded a limited release in the United States on October 24, 2008, followed by a general release in North America on October 31, 2008; in the United Kingdom on November 26, 2008; and in Australia on February 5, 2009. Critical reaction was more mixed than at Cannes. While the acting and story were generally praised, the film's "conventional staging" and "lack of nuance" were criticized. ''Changeling'' earned $113&amp;nbsp;million in box-office revenue worldwide{{spaced ndash}}of which $35.7&amp;nbsp;million came from the United States and Canada{{spaced ndash}}and received nominations in three [[Academy Award]] and eight [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0824747/awards?ref_=tt_awd |title=Changeling- Awards |publisher=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=June 6, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128024304/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0824747/awards?ref_=tt_awd |archivedate=November 28, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=changeling08.htm |title=Changeling |publisher=BoxOfficeMojo.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601150907/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=changeling08.htm |archivedate=June 1, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

In [[Los Angeles]] in 1928, single mother [[Christine Collins]] returns home to discover her nine-year-old son, Walter, is missing. Reverend Gustav Briegleb publicizes Christine's plight and rails against the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) for its incompetence, corruption and the [[extrajudicial punishment]] meted out by its "Gun Squad" led by [[James E. Davis (police)|Chief James E. Davis]]. Several months after Walter's disappearance, the LAPD tells Christine that the boy has been found alive. Believing the positive publicity will negate recent criticism of the department, the LAPD organizes a public reunion. Although "Walter" claims he is Christine's son, she says he is not. Captain J. J. Jones, the head of the LAPD's Juvenile Division, insists the boy is Walter and pressures Christine into taking him home "on a trial basis".

After Christine confronts Jones with physical discrepancies between "Walter" and her son, Jones arranges for a medical doctor to visit her. He tells Christine that "Walter" is three inches shorter than before his disappearance because trauma has shrunk his spine, and that the man who took Walter had him [[Circumcision|circumcised]]. A newspaper prints a story that implies Christine is an unfit mother; Briegleb tells Christine it was planted by police to discredit her. Walter's teacher and dentist each give Christine signed letters confirming "Walter" is an impostor. Christine tells her story to the press; as a result, Jones sends her to [[Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center|Los Angeles County Hospital]]'s "[[Psychiatric ward|psychopathic ward]]". She befriends inmate Carol Dexter, who tells Christine she is one of several women who were sent there for challenging police authority. Dr. Steele (O'Hare) diagnoses Christine as delusional and forces her to take mood-regulating pills. Steele says he will release Christine if she admits she was mistaken about "Walter"; she refuses.

Detective Ybarra travels to a ranch in [[Mira Loma, California|Wineville]], [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], to arrange the deportation of 15-year-old Sanford Clark to [[Canada]]. The boy's uncle, Gordon Northcott, has fled after a chance encounter with Ybarra, who mentions his business there being a juvenile matter. Clark tells Ybarra that Northcott forced him to help kidnap and murder around twenty children, and identifies Walter as one of them. Jones tells Briegleb that Christine is in protective custody following a mental breakdown. Jones orders Clark's deportation, but Ybarra takes Clark to the murder site and tells him to dig where the bodies are buried. Clark hesitates, but soon uncovers body parts. Briegleb secures Christine's release by showing Steele a newspaper story about the Wineville killings that names Walter as a possible victim. Under interrogation by Ybarra, Walter's impostor reveals his motive was to secure transport to Los Angeles to see his favorite actor, [[Tom Mix]], and says the police told him to lie about being Christine's son. The police capture Northcott in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada. Meanwhile, Briegleb introduces Christine and her case to famed attorney "S.S." Hahn who takes the case ''pro bono'' and quickly secures a court order for the release of other unjustly imprisoned women whom the police wanted to silence.

On the day of the city council's hearing into the case, Christine, Hahn, and Briegleb arrive at Los Angeles City Hall, where they encounter thousands of protesters who are demanding answers from the city and decrying the LAPD. The hearing is intercut with scenes from Northcott's trial. The council concludes that Jones and Davis should be removed from duty, and that extrajudicial internments by police must be stopped. Northcott's jury finds him guilty of murder and the judge sentences him to death by hanging.

Two years later, Christine has still not given up her search for Walter. Northcott sends her a message saying he is willing to admit to killing Walter on condition that Christine meets him before his execution. She visits Northcott, but he refuses to tell her if he killed her son. Northcott is executed the next day.

In 1935, David Clay, one of the boys assumed to have been killed, is found alive in [[Hesperia, California]]. He reveals that one of the boys with whom he was imprisoned was Walter. David, Walter, and another boy escaped, but were separated. David does not know whether Walter was recaptured, but he says Walter helped him escape, giving Christine hope he is alive.

In the epilogue, it states that after the hearing, Captain Jones was suspended, Chief Davis was demoted, and Los Angeles Mayor [[George E. Cryer|George Cryer]] chose not to run for reelection. California's [[state legislature]] made it illegal to forcibly commit people to psychiatric facilities by mere words alone of authorities, and Rev. Briegleb continued to use his radio show to expose police misconduct and political corruption. Wineville is said to have changed its name to Mira Loma to escape the stigma of the murders, and Christine Collins reportedly never stopped searching for her son.

==Historical context==

{{Main|Wineville Chicken Coop Murders}}
In 1926, 13-year-old Sanford Clark was taken from his home in [[Saskatchewan]] (with the permission of his mother and reluctant father) by his uncle, 19-year-old Gordon Stewart Northcott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flacco|first=Anthony|others=Clark, Jerry|title=The Road Out of Hell: Sanford Clark and the True Story of the Wineville Murders|publisher=Union Square Press|isbn=978-1-4027-6869-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northcott took Clark to a ranch in Wineville, California, where he regularly beat and sexually abused the boy ‚Äî until {{Nowrap|August 1928}}, when the police took Clark into custody after his sister, 19-year-old Jessie Clark, informed them of the situation.&lt;ref name="stokley"/&gt; Clark revealed that he was forced to help Northcott and his mother, Sarah Louise Northcott, in killing three young boys after Northcott had kidnapped and molested them.&lt;ref name="stokley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="howells"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.film.com/movies/spoilers-changeling-the-real-story-behind-eastwoods-movie |title=Spoilers: Changeling - The Real Story Behind Eastwood's Movie |author=Sacha Howells |work=film.com |publisher=[[RealNetworks]] |date=November 7, 2008 |accessdate=November 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203003243/http://www.film.com/movies/spoilers-changeling-the-real-story-behind-eastwoods-movie |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The police found no bodies at the ranch ‚Äî Clark said they were dumped in the desert ‚Äî but discovered body parts, blood-stained axes, and personal effects belonging to missing children. The Northcotts fled to Canada, but were arrested and extradited to the United States. Sarah Louise initially confessed to murdering Walter Collins, she later retracted her statement; Gordon, who had confessed to killing five boys, did likewise.&lt;ref name="howells"/&gt;

Christine Collins was placed in Los Angeles County Hospital by Captain Jones. After her release, she sued the police department twice, winning the second lawsuit. Although Captain Jones was ordered to pay Collins $10,800, he never did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/07/local/me-5769 |title=The Boy Who Vanished‚Äîand His Impostor |author=Cecilia Rasmussen |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 7, 1999 |accessdate=February 23, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308060243/http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/07/local/me-5769 |archivedate=March 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A city council welfare hearing recommended that Jones and Chief of Police [[James E.

Sarah Louise was convicted of Walter Collins' murder and served almost 12 years in prison.&lt;ref name="stokley"/&gt; In 1930, the residents of Wineville changed the town's name to [[Mira Loma]] to escape the notoriety brought by the case.&lt;ref name="howells"/&gt;

==Production==

===Development===
Several years before writing ''Changeling'', television screenwriter and former journalist [[J. Michael Straczynski]] was contacted by a source at [[Los Angeles City Hall]]. The source told him that officials were planning to burn numerous archive documents,&lt;ref name="united"/&gt; among them "something [Straczynski] should see".

===Writing===
Straczynski viewed "sitting down and ferreting out [the] story" as a return to his journalistic roots. He also drew on his experience writing crime drama for the [[Police procedural|procedural]] elements of the plot.&lt;ref name="wga"/&gt; Straczynski said he had gathered so much information about the case that it was difficult to work out how to tell it. To let the story develop at its own pace, he put the project aside to allow himself to forget the less essential elements and bring into focus the parts he wanted to tell. He described what he saw as two overlaid triangles: "the first triangle, with the point up, is Collins' story. You start with her, and her story gets broader and broader and begins having impact from all kinds of places. The overlay on that was an upside down triangle with the base on top, which is the panorama of Los Angeles at that time‚Äî1928. And it begins getting narrower and narrower toward the bottom, bearing down on her." Once Straczynski saw this structure, he felt he could write the story.&lt;ref name="creative"/&gt; He chose to avoid focusing on the atrocities of the Wineville murders in favor of telling the story from Collins' perspective;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95935010 |title=Behind 'Changeling,' A Tale Too Strange For Fiction |author=Elizabeth Blair |work=[[National Public Radio]] |date=October 24, 2008 |accessdate=October 24, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026095347/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95935010 |archivedate=October 26, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Straczynski said she was the only person in the story without a hidden agenda,&lt;ref name="creative"/&gt; and it was her tenacity‚Äîas well as the legacy the case left throughout California's legal system‚Äîthat had attracted him to the project. He said, "My intention was very simple: to honor what Christine Collins did."&lt;ref name="notes"&gt;{{cite web|title='Changeling' production notes|work=universalpicturesawards.com|publisher=[[Universal Pictures]]|url=http://www.universalpicturesawards.com/docs/prodNotes/Changeling_Notes.doc|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225171820/http://www.universalpicturesawards.com/docs/prodNotes/Changeling_Notes.doc|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 25, 2009|accessdate=October 18, 2008|format=[[Microsoft Word]] document}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One was the sequence set in the psychopathic ward, for which there was only limited after-the-fact testimony.&lt;ref name="amc"/&gt; Straczynski originally wrote a shorter account of Collins' incarceration. His agent suggested the sequence needed development, so Straczynski extrapolated events based on standard practice in such institutions at the time. It was at this stage he created composite character Carol Dexter, who was intended to symbolize the women of the era who had been unjustly committed.&lt;ref name="creative"/&gt; Straczynski cited his academic background, including [[Academic major|majors]] in psychology and sociology, as beneficial to writing the scenes, specifically one in which Steele distorts Collins' words to make her appear delusional.&lt;ref name="wga"/&gt; Straczynski worked at making the dialogue authentic, while avoiding an archaic tone. He cited his experience imagining alien psyches when writing ''[[Babylon 5]]'' as good practice for putting himself in the cultural mindset of the 1920s.&lt;ref name="creative"/&gt;

Straczynski described specific visual cues in the screenplay, such as in Sanford Clark's confession scene. Clark's flashback to a falling axe is juxtaposed with the crumbling ash from Detective Ybarra's cigarette. The image served two purposes: it was an aesthetic correlation between the axe and the cigarette, and it suggested that Ybarra was so shocked by Clark's confession that he had not moved or even smoked in the 10 minutes Clark took to tell his story. As with most of the cues, Eastwood shot the scene as written.&lt;ref name="creative"/&gt; To ensure the veracity of the story, Straczynski incorporated quotes from the historical record, including court testimony, into the dialogue. He also included photocopies of news clippings every 15‚Äì20 pages in the script to remind people the story was a true one.&lt;ref name="notes"/&gt; So the credits could present the film as "a true story" rather than as "based on" one, Straczynski went through the script with Universal's legal department, providing attribution for every scene.&lt;ref name="cruz"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1852963,00.html |title=Q&amp;A: Changeling Writer J.

Among the changes Straczynski made from the historical record was to omit Northcott's mother‚Äîwho participated in the murders‚Äîfrom the story.

[[James J. Murakami]] supervised the production design.

Suburban areas in [[San Dimas, California|San Dimas]], [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] and [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] doubled for 1920s Los Angeles instead. The Old Town district of San Dimas stood in for Collins' neighborhood and some adjacent locales. Murakami said Old Town was chosen because very little had changed since the 1920s. It was used for interiors and exteriors; the crew decorated the area with a subdued color palette to evoke feelings of comfort.&lt;ref name="notes"/&gt; For some exterior shots they renovated derelict properties in neighborhoods of Los Angeles that still possessed 1920s architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Clint Eastwood]], [[Jon Stewart]]|date=October 2, 2008|title=The Daily Show with Jon Stewart|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=186778&amp;title=Clint-Eastwood|medium=Television production|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|location=[[New York City]]|accessdate=October 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew staged the third floor of the Park Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles into a replica of the 1920s [[Los Angeles City Council]] chambers.&lt;ref name="asc"/&gt;

The production sourced around 150 vintage motor cars, dating from 1918 to 1928, from collectors throughout Southern California. In some cases the cars were in too good a condition, so the crew modified them to make the cars appear like they were in everyday use; they sprayed dust and water onto the bodywork, and to "age" some of the cars they applied a coating that simulated rust and scratches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2008/11/scene-stealer-c.html |title=Scene Stealer: 'Changeling's' vintage autos |author=Patrick Kevin Day |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109062226/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2008/11/scene-stealer-c.html |archivedate=November 9, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The visual effects team retouched shots of Los Angeles City Hall‚Äîon which construction was completed in 1928‚Äîto remove weathering and newer surrounding architecture.&lt;ref name="notes"/&gt; Costume designer [[Deborah Hopper]] researched old [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears department store]] catalogs, back issues of [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]], and high-school yearbooks to ensure the costumes were historically accurate.&lt;ref name="brisbane"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/life-and-style/changeling-your-wardrobe/2009/02/02/1233423111748.html |title=Changeling your wardrobe |author=Rachel Wells |work=[[Brisbane Times]] |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |date=February 2, 2009 |accessdate=February 2, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214124741/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/life-and-style/changeling-your-wardrobe/2009/02/02/1233423111748.html |archivedate=December 14, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopper sourced 1920s clothing for up to 1,000 people; this was difficult because the fabrics of the period were not resilient.

All he's there to do is tell the story, and he hired actors to tell their story."&lt;ref name="united"/&gt; [[Gaffer (filmmaking)|Gaffer]] Ross Dunkerley said he often had to work on a scene without having seen a rehearsal: "Chances are we'll talk about it for a minute or two, and then we're executing it."&lt;ref name="asc"/&gt;

The original edit was almost three hours long; to hone it to 141 minutes, Eastwood cut material from the first part of the film to get to Collins' story sooner. To improve the pacing he also cut scenes that focused on Reverend Briegleb.&lt;ref name="creative"/&gt; Eastwood deliberately left the ending of the film ambiguous to reflect the uncertain fates of several characters in the history. He said that while some stories aimed to finish at the end of a film, he preferred to leave it open-ended.&lt;ref name="le monde"/&gt;

====Cinematography====
''Changeling'' was director of photography [[Tom Stern (cinematographer)|Tom Stern]]'s sixth film with Eastwood.&lt;ref name="asc"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heuring|first=David|title=Lost and Seemingly Found|journal=[[American Cinematographer]]|publisher=[[American Society of Cinematographers]]|date=November 2008|volume=89|issue=11|pages=18‚Äì20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the muted palette, the film is more colorful than some previous Stern‚ÄìEastwood collaborations. Stern referenced a large book of period images. He attempted to evoke [[Conrad Hall]]'s work on [[Great Depression|Depression]]-set film ''[[The Day of the Locust (film)|The Day of the Locust]]'', as well as match what he called the "leanness" of ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]''{{'}}s look. Stern said the challenge was to make ''Changeling'' as simple as possible to shoot. To focus more on Jolie's performance, he tended to avoid the use of [[fill light]]ing.&lt;ref name="asc"/&gt; Eastwood did not want the flashbacks to Northcott's ranch to be too much like a horror film‚Äîhe said the focus of the scene was the effect of the crimes on Sanford Clark‚Äîso he avoided graphic imagery in favor of casting the murders in shadow.&lt;ref name="andrew"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Changeling Man | author=Geoff Andrew | journal=[[Sight &amp; Sound]] | issn= 0037-4806 | page=17 | volume=18 | issue=9 | date=September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stern shot ''Changeling'' in [[anamorphic format]] on [[35 mm film|35mm film]] using [[List of motion picture film stocks#VISION color negative (ECN-2 process 1996‚Äì2002)|Kodak Vision 500T 5279]] film stock. The film was shot on [[Panavision]] cameras and C-Series lenses. Due to the large number of sets, the lighting rigs were more extensive than on other Eastwood productions. The crew made several ceilings from bleached [[muslin]] tiles. Stern lit the tiles from above to produce a soft, warm light that was intended to evoke the period through tones close to antique and [[Sepia (color)|sepia]]. The crew segregated the tiles using fire safety fabric Duvatyn to prevent light spilling onto neighboring clusters. The [[key light]] was generally softer to match the warm tones given off by the toplights. Stern used stronger [[skypan]]s‚Äîmore intense than is commonly used for key lighting‚Äîto reduce contrasts when applying daytime rain effects, as a single light source tended to produce harder shadows.&lt;ref name="asc"/&gt;

Stern lit scenes filmed at the Park Plaza Hotel using dimmable [[hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide lamp|HMI]] and tungsten lights rigged within [[balloon light]]s. This setup allowed him to "dial in" the color he wanted, as the blend of tones from the tungsten fixtures, wooden walls and natural daylight made it difficult to illuminate the scenes using HMIs or daylight exclusively. Stern said the period setting had little effect overall on his lighting choices because the look was mostly applied in the production design and during [[digital intermediate]] (DI), the post-production digital manipulation of color and lighting. [[Thomson SA|Technicolor Digital Intermediates]] carried out the DI. Stern supervised most of the work via e-mailed reference images as he was in Russia shooting another film at the time. He was present at the laboratory for the application of the finishing touches.&lt;ref name="asc"/&gt;

[[Rainmaker Digital Effects|CIS Vancouver]] and Pac Title created most of the visual effects, under the overall supervision of Michael Owens.

The team's work began with research into 1928 Los Angeles; they referenced historical photographs and data on the urban core's population density.&lt;ref name="vfx"/&gt; CIS had to generate mostly new computer models, textures and motion capture because the company's existing effects catalog consisted primarily of modern era elements.&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt; CIS supplemented exteriors with skylines and detailed backdrops.&lt;ref name="notes"/&gt; They created set extensions digitally and with matte paintings.&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt; CIS created city blocks by using shared elements of period architecture that could be combined, rearranged and restacked to make buildings of different widths and heights; that way, the city could look diverse with a minimum of textural variation. CIS referenced vintage aerial photographs of downtown Los Angeles so shots would better reflect the geography of the city, as Hancock felt it important to have a consistency that would allow audiences to understand and become immersed in the environment.&lt;ref name="vfx"/&gt;

To maintain the rapid shooting pace Eastwood demanded, Owens chose to mostly avoid using [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] technology, as the process can be time-consuming and difficult to light. He instead used [[rotoscoping]], the process whereby effects are drawn directly onto live action shots.&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt; Rotoscoping is more expensive than bluescreen, but the technique had proved reliable for Eastwood when he made extensive use of it on ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]''&amp;nbsp;(2006) to avoid shooting against bluescreen on a mountaintop. For Owens, the lighting was better, and he considered rotoscoping to be "faster, easier and more natural".&lt;ref name="vfx"/&gt; Owens used bluescreen in only a few locations, such as at the ends of backlot streets where it would not impact the lighting.&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt; The Universal Studios backlot had been used for so many films that Owens thought it important to disguise familiar architecture as much as possible, so some foreground and middle distance buildings were swapped. One of his favorite effects shots was a scene in which Collins exits a taxi in front of the police station. The scene was filmed almost entirely against bluescreen; only Jolie, the [[sidewalk]], the taxi cab and an extra were real. The completed shot features the full range of effects techniques used in the film: digital extras in the foreground, set extensions, and computer-generated vehicles.&lt;ref name="vfx"/&gt;

====Digital extras====
For crowd scenes, CIS supplemented the live-action extras with digital pedestrians created using motion capture.&lt;ref name="vfx"/&gt; House of Moves captured the movements of five men and four women during a two-day shoot supervised by Hancock.&lt;ref name="vfx2"/&gt; The motion capture performers were coached to make the "small, formal and refined" movements that Owens said reflected the general public's conduct at the time.&lt;ref name="vfx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt; CIS combined the motion data with the [[Massive (software)|Massive]] software package to generate the interactions of the digital pedestrians. The use of Massive presented a challenge when it came to blending digital pedestrians with live-action extras who had to move from the foreground into the digital crowd.&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt; Massive worked well until this stage, when the effects team had to move the digital pedestrians to avoid taking the live-action extras out of the shot.&lt;ref name="vfx"/&gt; To allow close-ups of individual Massive extras, the effects team focused on their faces and walking characteristics. Hancock explained, "We wanted to be able to push Massive right up to the camera and see how well it held up. In a couple of shots the characters might be 40 feet away from the camera, about 1/5 screen height. The bigger the screen is, the bigger the character. He could be 10 feet tall, so everything, even his hair, better look good!"&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt; Typically, a limited number of motion performances are captured and Massive is used to create further variety, such as in height and walking speed. Because the digital extras were required to be close to the foreground,&lt;ref name="vfx2"/&gt; and to integrate them properly with the live action extras, House of Moves captured twice as much motion data than CIS had used on any other project.&lt;ref name="vfx"/&gt; CIS created nine distinct digital characters. To eliminate inaccuracies that develop when creating a digital extra of different proportions to the motion capture performer, CIS sent nine skeleton rigs to House of Moves before work began. This gave House of Moves time to properly adapt the rigs to its performers, resulting in motion capture data that required very little editing in Massive.&lt;ref name="vfx2"/&gt; CIS wrote [[shader]]s for their clothing; [[displacement mapping|displacement maps]] in the air shader were linked with the motion capture to animate wrinkles in trousers and jackets.&lt;ref name="vfx"/&gt;

====Closing sequence====
[[File:Changeling closing sequence.png|300px|thumb|alt=Elevated daytime view of a busy city crossroads, looking down one street along which a series of tall buildings recede into the distance. Pedestrians line the sidewalks, cars litter the streets; a bright red electric streetcar features in the foreground|In the final shot, the perspective slowly lifts to take in the city scene. The sequence was introduced to give the audience room for emotional reflection after previous versions of the film ended with a [[Fade (lighting)|cut to black]].&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt; The streetcars, tracks, power lines and most of the extras were computer generated.&lt;ref name="vfx"/&gt; The buildings in the distance were created digitally with [[matte painting]]s.&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt;]]
Forgoing the [[Closure (psychology)|closure]] favored by its contemporaries, ''Changeling''{{'}}s final sequence reflects Collins' renewed hope that Walter is alive.&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hanks"/&gt; The shot is a two and a half minute sequence showing Collins' walking off to become lost in a crowd.&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt; The sequence is representative of the range of effects that feature throughout the film; Los Angeles is presented as major character,&lt;ref name=vfx/&gt; brought to life by unobtrusive peripheral imagery that allows the viewer to focus on the story and the emotional cues. The "hustle and bustle" of the sequence was required to convey that downtown Los Angeles in 1935 was a congested urban center. In the closing shot, the camera tilts up to reveal miles of city blocks,&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt; pedestrians on the streets, cars going by and streetcars running along their tracks.&lt;ref name="vfx"/&gt; The version of the film that screened at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] did not include this sequence; the scene faded to black as Collins walked away. The new 4,000-frame shot was Owens' idea. He felt the abrupt cut to black pulled the viewer out of the film too quickly, and that it left no room for emotional reflection. Owens said, "There is a legend at the end before the credits. The legend speaks to what happened after the fact, and I think you need to just swallow that for a few moments with the visual still with you." Owens told Eastwood the film should end like ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''&amp;nbsp;(1974), in which the camera lifts to take in the scene: "The camera booms up and she walks away from us from a very emotional, poignant scene at the end, walks away into this mass of people and traffic. It's very hopeful and sad at the same time."&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt;

Owens did not have time to complete the shot before the Cannes screenings, but afterwards he used [[cineSync]] to conduct most of the work from home. The shot includes two blocks of computer-generated buildings that recede into the distance of a downtown set extension. As Collins disappears into the crowd about a minute into the shot, the live footage is gradually joined with more digital work.&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt; The streetcars, tracks and power lines were all computer generated. Live-action extras appear for the first minute of the shot before being replaced by digital ones. The shot was made more complicated by the need to add [[Massive (software)|Massive]] extras.&lt;ref name="vfx"/&gt; Owens constructed the scene by first building the digital foreground around the live action footage. He then added the background before filling the scene with vehicles and people.&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt;

===Music===
{{main|Changeling (soundtrack)}}
Eastwood composed ''Changeling''{{'}}s [[jazz]]-influenced score. Featuring lilting guitars and strings, it remains largely low-key throughout. The introduction of [[brass instrument]]s evokes film noir, playing to the film's setting in a city controlled by corrupt police. The theme shifts from piano to a full orchestra, and as the story develops, the strings become more imposing, with an increasing number of [[sustain]]s and [[Melodic motion|rises]]. Eastwood introduces voices reminiscent of those in a horror film score during the child murder flashbacks.&lt;ref name="musicmag"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.filmmusicmag.com/?p=2110 |title=CD Review: Changeling‚ÄîOriginal Soundtrack |author=Daniel Schweiger |work=Film Music Magazine |publisher=Global Media Online |date=November 25, 2008 |accessdate=November 26, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231035040/http://www.filmmusicmag.com/?p=2110 |archivedate=December 31, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95990500 |title='Changeling' Another Step In Eastwood's Evolution |author=Elizabeth Blair |work=[[National Public Radio]] |date=October 24, 2008 |accessdate=April 23, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317054011/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95990500 |archivedate=March 17, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The score was orchestrated and conducted by [[Lennie Niehaus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=[[Changeling (soundtrack)|Changeling Soundtrack]]|others=[[Clint Eastwood]]|date=2008|type=CD liner|publisher=[[Var√®se Sarabande]]|id=3020669342}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on CD in North America on {{Nowrap|November 4}}, 2008, through record label [[Var√®se Sarabande]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varesesarabande.com/servlet/the-251/Changeling/Detail |title=Changeling: Product Details |work=varesesarabande.com |publisher=[[Var√®se Sarabande]] |accessdate=November 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105164849/http://www.varesesarabande.com/servlet/the-251/Changeling/Detail |archivedate=January 5, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

===Disempowerment of women===
''Changeling'' begins with an abduction, but largely avoids framing the story as a family drama to concentrate on a portrait of a woman whose desire for independence is seen as a threat to male-dominated society.&lt;ref name="le monde"/&gt;&lt;ref name="liberation"/&gt; The film depicts 1920s Los Angeles as a city in which the judgment of men takes precedence; women are labeled "hysterical and unreliable" if they dare to question it.&lt;ref name="honeycutt"/&gt; Film critic Prairie Miller said that in its portrayal of female courage the film was "about as feminist as Hollywood can get", and that because of this it had been the subject of sexist disdain. She compared this with the sexism shown to the women in ''Changeling'' and those who vied for high political office in 2008. Miller surmised that attitudes to independent, career-minded women had not changed significantly in the intervening years: Collins defies male-generated cultural expectations that women are not suited for professional careers and are punished for it.&lt;ref name="newsblaze"/&gt; Rather than "an expression of feminist awareness", [[David Denby (film critic)|David Denby]] argues, the film‚Äîlike Eastwood's ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]''‚Äîis "a case of awed respect for a woman who was strong and enduring".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/03/08/100308fa_fact_denby?currentPage=all#ixzz0hnyNNTgl |title=Out of the West |author=David Denby |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=March 8, 2010 |accessdate=March 10, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307020408/http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/03/08/100308fa_fact_denby?currentPage=all |archivedate=March 7, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait of a vulnerable woman whose mental state is manipulated by the authorities was likened to the treatment of [[Ingrid Bergman]]'s character in ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]''&amp;nbsp;(1944), who also wondered if she might be insane;&lt;ref name="le monde"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216215113/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/files/2008/10/why-i-disagree.html|archivedate=February 16, 2009|deadurl=yes|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/files/2008/10/why-i-disagree.html|author=Scott Feinberg|title='Changeling' and Angelina Jolie: Awards are not won on paper|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 7, 2008|accessdate=October 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood cited photographs that show Collins smiling with the child she knows is not hers.&lt;ref name="le monde"/&gt; Like many other women of the period who were deemed disruptive, Collins is forced into the secret custody of a mental institution. The film shows that psychiatry became a tool in the gender politics of the era, only a few years after [[History of women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage in the United States]] was guaranteed by the ratification of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]]. As women ceased to be second-class citizens and began to assert their independence, the male establishment used mental institutions in an effort to disempower them; in common with other unmanageable women, Collins is subjected to medical treatment designed to break her spirit and compel obedience, though some of the treatments, specifically the [[electroconvulsive therapy]] depicted in the film, did not exist ca. 1928-1930.&lt;ref name="newsblaze"/&gt; The film quotes the testimony of the psychiatrist who treated Collins. Eastwood said the testimony evidenced how women were prejudged, and that the behavior of the police reflected how women were seen at the time. He quoted the words of the officer who sent Collins to the mental facility: {{" '}}Something is wrong with you. You're an independent woman.{{' "}} Clint Eastwood said, "The period could not accept [it]".&lt;ref name="le monde"/&gt;

===Corruption in political hierarchies===
Romantic notions of the 1920s as a more innocent period are put aside in favor of depicting Los Angeles as ruled by a despotic political infrastructure, steeped in sadistic, systematic corruption throughout the city government, police force and medical establishment.&lt;ref name="notes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="honeycutt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1807949,00.html |author=Richard Corliss |title=Clint and Angelina Bring a Changeling Child to Cannes |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=May 20, 2008 |accessdate=October 10, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917113917/http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0%2C8599%2C1807949%2C00.html |archivedate=September 17, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being a [[Kafkaesque]] drama about the search for a missing child,&lt;ref name="hanks"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/film-of-the-week-changeling-15-1038392.html |title=Film of the week: Changeling |author=Robert Hanks |work=[[The Independent]] |date=November 28, 2008 |accessdate=April 16, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420042336/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/film-of-the-week-changeling-15-1038392.html |archivedate=April 20, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="new man"/&gt; the film also focuses on issues relevant to the modern era.&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/a/-/technology/5356827/eastwood-given-special-honour-cannes/|author=Staff|title=Eastwood given special honour by Cannes|work=[[Yahoo News]]/[[Australian Associated Press]]|date=February 27, 2009|accessdate=March 2, 2009}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood noted a correlation between the corruption of 1920s Los Angeles and that of the modern era, manifesting in the egos of a police force that thinks it cannot be wrong and the way in which powerful organizations justify the use of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brad-balfour/clint-eastwood-as-a-emcha_b_143287.html |title=Clint Eastwood As a Changeling |author=Brad Balfour |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=November 12, 2008 |accessdate=December 12, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405215800/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brad-balfour/clint-eastwood-as-a-emcha_b_143287.html |archivedate=April 5, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[The] Los Angeles police department every so often seems to go into a period of corruption," he said, "It's happened even in recent years&amp;nbsp;... so it was nice to comment [on that] by going back to real events in 1928."&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt; Eastwood said that Los Angeles had always been seen as "glamorous",&lt;ref name="andrew"/&gt; but he believed there had never been a "golden age" in the city.&lt;ref name="le monde"/&gt; In ''Changeling'', this dissonance manifests in the actions of Arthur Hutchins, who travels to the city in the hope of meeting his favorite actor. Eastwood said that given the corruption that the story covers, Hutchins' na√Øvete seemed "bizarre".&lt;ref name="andrew"/&gt; As a lesson in democratic activism, the film shows what it takes to provoke people to speak against unchecked authority, no matter the consequences. [[Richard Brody]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' said this rang as true for 1928 Los Angeles as it did for [[Gda≈Ñsk Agreement|Poland in 1980]] or [[Pakistani general election, 2008|Pakistan in 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/events/revivals/2009/03/09/090309gomo_GOAT_movies_brody |title=Eastwood Ho! |author=[[Richard Brody]] |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |date=March 9, 2009 |accessdate=March 2, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306081036/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/events/revivals/2009/03/09/090309gomo_GOAT_movies_brody |archivedate=March 6, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film directly quotes Chief of police James E. Davis: "We will hold trial on gunmen in the streets of Los Angeles. I want them brought in dead, not alive, and I will reprimand any officer who shows the least bit of mercy to a criminal."&lt;ref name="notes"/&gt; It compares police excess to the [[vigilante|vigilantism]] of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] of the 1920s, as the department's "Gun Squad" carries out illegal executions of criminals‚Äî"not to stamp out crime&amp;nbsp;... but 'competition{{'"}}. The pressure from the police hierarchy was a motivator for officers to quickly solve Walter Collins' disappearance, and a potential reason why they ignored the fact they had returned the wrong child.&lt;ref name="newsblaze"/&gt;

===Children and violence===
''Changeling'' sits with other late-period Eastwood films in which parenting‚Äîand the search for family‚Äîis a theme. It makes literal the parental struggle to communicate with children. It can also be seen as a variation of the Eastwood "revenge movie" ethic; in this case, the "avenging grunt" transforms into a courteous woman who only once makes a foul-mouthed outburst.&lt;ref name="new man"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article5814534.ece|title=How Clint Eastwood became a New Man|author=Andrew Billen|work=[[The Times]]|date=February 28, 2009|accessdate=March 2, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood dealt with themes of child endangerment in ''[[A Perfect World]]''&amp;nbsp;(1993) and ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]''&amp;nbsp;(2003).&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{cite news|author=David Germain|title=Eastwood takes on mother's story; Jolie plays single mom whose child goes missing|work=[[The Chronicle Herald]]|agency=Associated Press|date=May 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Changeling'' is a thematic companion piece to ''Mystic River'',&lt;ref name="le monde"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mccarthy"/&gt; which also depicted a community contaminated by an isolated, violent act against a child‚Äîa comparison with which Eastwood agreed.&lt;ref name="le monde"/&gt; He said that showing a child in danger was "about the highest form of drama you can have", as crimes against them were to him the most horrible.&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt; Eastwood explained that crimes against children represented a theft of lives and innocence.&lt;ref name="andrew"/&gt; He said, "When [a crime] comes along quite as big as this one, you question humanity. It never ceases to surprise me how cruel humanity can be."&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt; Samuel Blumenfeld of ''[[Le Monde]]'' said the scene featuring Northcott's execution by hanging was "unbearable" due to its attention to detail; he believed it one of the most convincing pleas against the death penalty imaginable. Eastwood noted that for a supporter of capital punishment, Northcott was an ideal candidate, and that in a perfect world the death penalty might be an appropriate punishment for such a crime.&lt;ref name="le monde"/&gt; He said that crimes against children would be at the top of his list for justifications of capital punishment,&lt;ref name="revisits"/&gt; but that whether one were pro- or anti-capital punishment, the barbarism of public executions must be recognized. Eastwood argued that in putting the guilty party before his victims' families, justice may be done, but after such a spectacle the family would find it hard to find peace. The scene's realism was deliberate: the audience hears Northcott's neck breaking, his body swings, and his feet shake. It was Eastwood's intention to make it unbearable to watch.&lt;ref name="le monde"/&gt;

The producers and Universal considered opening ''Changeling'' wide in its first weekend to capitalize on Jolie's perceived [[box office]] appeal, but they ultimately modeled the release plan after those of other Eastwood-directed films, ''Mystic River'' in particular.

The film's screening at Cannes met with critical acclaim, prompting speculation it could be awarded the [[Palme d'Or]].&lt;ref name="creative"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2008/05/clint-eastwood.html |title=Clint Eastwood could win the Palme d'Or for his Angelina Jolie pic (whatever the title is) |author=Tom O'Neil |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 21, 2008 |accessdate=May 21, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612155432/http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2008/05/clint-eastwood.html |archivedate=June 12, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The award eventually went to ''[[Entre les murs]]'' (''The Class'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kenneth Turan |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-cannes26-2008may26,0,7548309.story |title=Palme d'Or goes to France's 'Entre les Murs' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 28, 2008 |accessdate=October 7, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926175120/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-cannes26-2008may26%2C0%2C7548309.story |archivedate=September 26, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Straczynski claimed that ''Changeling''{{'}}s loss by two votes was due to the judges' not believing the story was based on fact.

Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said Jolie was more affecting than in ''[[A Mighty Heart (film)|A Mighty Heart]]''&amp;nbsp;(2007) because she relied less on artifice. He also noted a surfeit of good supporting performances, Michael Kelly's in particular.&lt;ref name="mccarthy"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=awardcentral&amp;jump=review&amp;id=film&amp;reviewid=VE1117937210 |title='Changeling' review |author=Todd McCarthy |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=May 20, 2008 |accessdate=May 21, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530214100/http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=awardcentral |archivedate=May 30, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver S√©guret of ''[[Lib√©ration]]'' said the cast was the film's best feature.

He said that with the distractions of Jolie's celebrity and beauty put aside, she carried the role with restraint and intensity.&lt;ref name="ansen"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/164500 |title=The Horror Of It All |author=David Ansen |journal=[[Newsweek]] |date=October 18, 2008 |accessdate=October 21, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021004044/http://www.newsweek.com/id/164500 |archivedate=October 21, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' felt that Jolie's celebrity was distracting enough to render her unconvincing,&lt;ref name="dargis"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/21/movies/21dargis.html |title=A California of Noir Shadows and Blood |author=[[Manohla Dargis]] |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 21, 2008 |accessdate=November 11, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525044111/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/21/movies/21dargis.html |archivedate=May 25, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Denby (film critic)|David Denby]] of ''The New Yorker'' said that while Jolie showed skill and selflessness, the performance and character were uninteresting. He said Collins was one-dimensional, lacking desires or temperament. He cited similar problems with Malkovich's Briegleb, concluding, "The two of them make a very proper and dull pair of collaborators."&lt;ref name="denby"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2008/10/27/081027crci_cinema_denby?currentPage=all |title=Troubled Sons |author=David Denby |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |date=October 27, 2008 |accessdate=October 20, 2008 |authorlink=David Denby (film critic) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023054716/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2008/10/27/081027crci_cinema_denby?currentPage=all |archivedate=October 23, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCarthy admired the "outstanding" script, calling it ambitious and deceptively simple. He said Eastwood respected the script by not playing to the melodramatic aspects and not telegraphing the story's scope from the start.&lt;ref name="mccarthy"/&gt; Honeycutt wrote that due to its close adherence to the history the drama sagged at one point, but that the film did not feel as long as its 141 minutes because the filmmakers were "good at cutting to the chase".&lt;ref name="honeycutt"/&gt; Ansen said Straczynski's dialogue tended to the obvious, but that while the film lacked the moral nuance of Eastwood's others, the well-researched screenplay was "a model of sturdy architecture", each layer of which built audience disgust into a "fine fury". He said, "when the tale is this gripping, why resist the moral outrage?"&lt;ref name="ansen"/&gt;

S√©guret said the film presented a solid recreation of the era, but that Eastwood did not seem inspired by the challenge. S√©guret noted that Eastwood kept the embers of the story alight, but that it seldom burst into flames. He likened the experience to being in a luxury car: comfortable yet boring.&lt;ref name="liberation"/&gt; Denby and Ansen commented that Eastwood left the worst atrocities to audiences' imaginations. Ansen said this was because Eastwood was less interested in the lurid aspects of the case.&lt;ref name="ansen"/&gt; McCarthy praised the thoughtful, unsensationalized treatment,&lt;ref name="mccarthy"/&gt; while Denby cited problems with the austere approach, saying it left the film "both impressive and monotonous". He said Eastwood was presented with the problem of not wanting to exploit the "gruesome" material because this would contrast poorly with the delicate emotions of a woman's longing for her missing son. Denby said Eastwood and Straczynski should have explored more deeply the story's perverse aspects. Instead, he said, the narrative methodically settled the emotional and dramatic issues‚Äî"reverently chronicling Christine's apotheosis"‚Äîbefore "[ambling] on for another forty minutes".&lt;ref name="denby"/&gt; Ansen said the classical approach lifted the story to another level, and that it embraced horror film conventions only in the process of transcending them.&lt;ref name="ansen"/&gt; McCarthy said ''Changeling'' was one of Eastwood's most vividly realized films, noting Stern's cinematography, the set and costume design, and CGI landscapes that merged seamlessly with location shots.&lt;ref name="mccarthy"/&gt; Dargis was not impressed by the production design; she cited the loss of Eastwood's regular collaborator [[Henry Bumstead]]‚Äîwho died in 2006‚Äîas a factor in ''Changeling''{{'}}s "overly pristine" look.&lt;ref name="dargis"/&gt;

Damon Wise of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' called ''Changeling'' "flawless",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/cannes2008/Post.asp?id=145 |title=Clint Eastwood's Changeling Is The Best Of The Festival So Far |author=Damon Wise |journal=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |date=May 20, 2008 |accessdate=May 21, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117034517/http://www.empireonline.com/features/cannes2008/Post.asp?id=145 |archivedate=November 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and McCarthy said it was "emotionally powerful and stylistically sure-handed". He stated that ''Changeling'' was a more complex and wide-ranging work than Eastwood's ''Mystic River'', saying the characters and social commentary were brought into the story with an "almost breathtaking deliberation". He said that as "a sorrowful critique of the city's political culture", ''Changeling'' sat in the company of films such as ''Chinatown'' and ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]''.&lt;ref name="mccarthy"/&gt; Honeycutt said the film added a "forgotten chapter to the L.A. noir" of those films, and that Eastwood's melodic score contributed to an evocation of a city and a period "undergoing galvanic changes". Honeycutt said, "[the] small-town feel to the street and sets&amp;nbsp;... captures a society resistant to seeing what is really going on".&lt;ref name="honeycutt"/&gt; S√©guret said that while ''Changeling'' had few defects, it was mystifying that other critics had such effusive praise for it.&lt;ref name="liberation"/&gt; Denby said it was beautifully made, but that it shared the chief fault of other "righteously indignant" films in congratulating the audience for feeling contempt for the "long-discredited" attitudes depicted.&lt;ref name="denby"/&gt; Ansen concluded that the story was told in such a sure manner that only a hardened cynic would be left unmoved by the "haunting, sorrowful saga".&lt;ref name="ansen"/&gt;

===Awards and honors===
In addition to the following list of awards and nominations, the [[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]] named ''Changeling'' one of the 10 best films of 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.variety.com/VR1117996815.html|title=NBR names 'Slumdog' best of year|author=Staff|journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 4, 2008|accessdate=December 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did the [[International Press Academy]], which presents the annual [[Satellite Award]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gregg Kilday |title=Int'l Press Academy announces nominations |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=November 30, 2008 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/intl-press-academy-announces-nominations-123650 |accessdate=December 3, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313054830/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/intl-press-academy-announces-nominations-123650 |archivedate=March 13, 2014 |df= }} (registration required for online access)&lt;/ref&gt; Several critics included the film on their lists of the top 10 best films of 2008.

'''Cheeseface''' was a [[dog]] who featured on the famous "Death" Issue of the ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' [[magazine]], released January 1973. The cover, [[photograph]]ed by Ronald G.

==Early life==
Chubbuck was born in [[Hudson, Ohio]], the daughter of Margaretha D. "Peg" (1921‚Äì1994) and George Fairbanks Chubbuck (1918‚Äì2015). She had two brothers, Greg and Tim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:KGR3-9SY |title=Margaretha D Chubbuck public record |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chubbuck attended the [[Laurel School|Laurel School for Girls]] in [[Shaker Heights, Ohio|Shaker Heights]], a suburb of [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]. During her years at Laurel, she started a small tongue-in-cheek group called the "Dateless Wonders Knitting Club." She attended [[Miami University]] in [[Oxford, Ohio]], for one year, majoring in theater arts, then attended [[Endicott College]] in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]], before earning a degree in [[broadcasting]] at [[Boston University]] in 1965.

==Career==

===Early work===
She worked for [[WVIZ]] in Cleveland for a year in 1966/1967, and attended a summer workshop in radio and television at [[New York University]] in 1967. Also in 1967, Chubbuck worked in [[Canton, Ohio]] and for three months at [[WQED-TV]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] as an assistant producer for two local shows, "Women's World" and "Keys to the City"&lt;ref name="pittspress"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lrMeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SVUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5410%2C40425 |title=TV Hostess Dies in 'Suicide Show' |newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press |date=July 16, 1974 |page=8 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; before leaving, in 1968, to spend four years as a hospital computer operator and two years with a cable television firm in [[Sarasota, Florida]]. Immediately before joining [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate WXLT-TV (now [[WWSB]]), she worked in the traffic department of [[WTOG]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]].&lt;ref name="dietz"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dietz |first=Jon |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mT0gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5mYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3508%2C10156 |title=On-Air Shot Kills TV Personality |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=July 16, 1974 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thurs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mj0gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5mYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6857,577333&amp;hl=en |title=Chris Chubbuck Memorial Services Thursday |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=July 17, 1974 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years before dying, Chubbuck had moved into her family's summer cottage on [[Siesta Key, Florida]]. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' later reported that she had painted the bedroom and canopied bed to look like that of a young teenager. After the [[divorce]] of their parents, her mother Peg and younger brother Greg came to live in the Florida home. When Greg left, her elder brother Timothy moved in. She had a close relationship with her family, describing her mother and Greg as her closest friends.&lt;ref name="manship2"/&gt;

Chubbuck volunteered at [[Sarasota Memorial Hospital]], giving [[Puppetry|puppet shows]] to children with [[intellectual disabilities]], and occasionally incorporated the homemade puppets into her WXLT-TV [[talk show]].&lt;ref name="manship2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manship2.lsu.edu/perkins/Handouts/chubbucknew.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041226184750/http://www.manship2.lsu.edu/perkins/Handouts/chubbucknew.pdf |title=Christine Chubbuck: 29, Good-Looking, Educated.

WXLT-TV's owner, Bob Nelson, had initially hired Chubbuck as a reporter but later gave her a community affairs talk show, ''Suncoast Digest'', which ran at 9:00 am. Production Manager Gordon J. Acker described Chubbuck's new show to a local paper: "It will feature local people and local activities. It will give attention, for instance, to the storefront organizations that are concerned with alcoholics, drug users, and other 'lost' segments of the community." Page five of the article showed a smiling Chubbuck posed with an ABC camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wesson |first=Helen |title=WXLT-TV Adds A.M. Talk Show |newspaper=Siesta Key Pelican |date=August 30, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chubbuck took her position seriously, inviting local [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]]‚Äì[[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]] officials to discuss matters of interest to the growing beach community. After her death, the ''[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]'' reported that Chubbuck had been nominated for a Forestry and Conservation Recognition Award by the Bradenton district office of the [[Florida Division of Forestry]]. She was considered a "strong contender" by district forester Mike Keel, who had been originally scheduled to appear as a guest on Chubbuck's show the morning of her suicide; he had cancelled out because of the birth of his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chris Chubbuck is Posthumous Award Candidate |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=July 20, 1974 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nD0gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5mYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4643%2C1741234 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

===Depression===
Chubbuck spoke to her family at length about her struggles with [[major depressive disorder|depression]] and suicidal tendencies, though she did not inform them of her specific intent beforehand. She had attempted to overdose on drugs in 1970 and frequently made reference to that event. She had also been seeing a [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] up until several weeks before her death. Chubbuck's mother chose not to tell station management of her daughter's suicidal tendencies, because she feared Chubbuck would be fired as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://archive.org/details/sixty90_protonmail_CC/page/n35 |last=Kamstock |first=Dr. Edwin L. |title=Autopsy report #A-74-203 |work=Sarasota County Sheriff's Dept. file, case #74-15120 |date=July 15, 1974 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her focus on her lack of intimate relationships is generally considered to be the driving force for her depression; her mother later summarized "her suicide was simply because her personal life was not enough." She lamented to co-workers that her 30th birthday was approaching and she was still a [[virginity|virgin]] who had never been on more than two dates with a man. Her brother Greg later recalled several times she had gone out with a man before moving to Sarasota, but agreed she had trouble connecting socially in the beach resort town. He believed her constant [[self-deprecation]] for being "dateless" contributed to her ongoing depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Interview with Greg Chubbuck for "Boulevard of Broken Dreams: Christine Chubbuck" |work=E! Entertainment Television |date=February 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later interview, Greg stated that Christine had been in two serious relationships: the first had been when she was a teenager and was with a man in his 20s who had subsequently died in a car accident, and the second had been as an adult, but she had broken it off under pressure from her bigoted father because the boyfriend was Jewish.&lt;ref name="Sun Interview"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1935393/troubled-life-christine-chubbuck-the-tv-anchor-who-shocked-the-world-by-shooting-herself-in-the-head-live-on-telly-coming-to-big-screen/ |newspaper=The Sun (U.K.) |title='I THINK ABOUT IT EVERY DAY' Bro of TV anchor Christine Chubbuck, who shot herself in the head live on telly, opens up about her troubled life in new films |last=Rollings |first=Grant |date=October 8, 2016 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She had her right [[ovary]] removed in an operation the year before, and had been told that if she did not become pregnant within two to three years, it was unlikely she would ever be able to [[Fertilisation|conceive]].&lt;ref name="manship2" /&gt;

According to the 1974 Sally Quinn article in the ''Washington Post'', Chubbuck had an unrequited crush on co-worker George Peter Ryan. She baked him a cake for his birthday and sought his romantic attention, only to find out he was already involved with sports reporter Andrea Kirby. Kirby had been the co-worker closest to Chubbuck, but she was offered a new job in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], which had further depressed Chubbuck.&lt;ref name="manship2" /&gt;

Chubbuck's lack of a romantic partner was considered a tangent of her desperate need to have close friends, though co-workers said she tended to be brusque and defensive whenever they made friendly gestures toward her. She was self-deprecating, criticizing herself constantly and rejecting any compliments others paid her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chubbuck Rites On Beach |newspaper=The Hudson Hub |date=July 28, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, her brother Greg recalled that she displayed many symptoms of [[bipolar disorder]], which was not generally recognized in the psychiatric community at the time of her death.&lt;ref name="Sun Interview" /&gt;

A week before her suicide, she told Rob Smith, the night news editor, that she had bought a gun and joked about killing herself on air. Smith later stated that he did not respond to what he thought was Chubbuck's "sick" attempt at humor, and changed the subject.&lt;ref name="dietz" /&gt;

===Suicide===
On the morning of July 15, 1974, Chubbuck confused co-workers by claiming she had to read a [[newscast]] to open ''Suncoast Digest'', something she had never done before. That morning's talk show guest waited across the studio while Chubbuck sat at the news anchor's desk.&lt;ref name="dietz"/&gt; During the first eight minutes of her program, Chubbuck covered three national news stories and then a shooting from the previous day at local restaurant Beef &amp; Bottle, at the [[Sarasota-Bradenton Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://archive.org/details/sixty90_protonmail_CC/ |title=Sarasota County Sheriff's Dept. file, case #74-15120 |date=July 15, 1974 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film reel of the restaurant shooting had jammed and would not run, so Chubbuck shrugged it off and said on-camera, "In keeping with Channel 40's policy of bringing you the latest in 'blood and guts' and in living color, you are going to see another first‚Äîan attempted suicide." She drew the revolver and shot herself behind her right ear.&lt;ref name="dietz"/&gt; Chubbuck fell forward violently and the technical director faded the broadcast rapidly to black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rubin |first=Valerie |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mT0gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5mYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=christine%20chubbuck&amp;pg=2581%2C10179 |title=Tragic TV drama unfolds before unbelieving eyes |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=July 16, 1974 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station quickly ran a standard [[public service announcement]] and then a movie.&lt;ref name="dmn"&gt;{{cite news |title=Newswoman shoots self on live TV |newspaper=The Dallas Morning News |date=July 16, 1974 |page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some television viewers called the police, while others called the station to inquire if the shooting was staged.&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;{{cite news |title=Florida TV talk show host dies after shooting herself during broadcast |newspaper=Associated Press |date=July 16, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rquote|right|She had written something like 'TV 40 news personality Christine Chubbuck shot herself in a live broadcast this morning on a Channel 40 talk program. She was rushed to Sarasota Memorial Hospital, where she remains in [[critical condition]].'|Mike Simmons, TV-40 news director|quoted in ''The Dallas Morning News''&lt;ref name="dmn"/&gt;}}After the shooting, news director Mike Simmons found the papers from which Chubbuck had been reading her newscast contained a complete script of her program, including not only the shooting, but also a third-person account to be read by whichever staff member took over the broadcast after the incident. He said her script called for her condition to be listed as "critical."&lt;ref name="dmn"/&gt;

Chubbuck was taken to Sarasota Memorial Hospital, where she was pronounced dead 14 hours later. Upon receiving the news, a WXLT staffer released the information to other stations using Chubbuck's script.&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt; For a time, WXLT aired [[rerun]]s of the TV series ''[[Gentle Ben]]'' in place of ''Suncoast Digest.&lt;ref name="thurs"/&gt;

===Aftermath===
Chubbuck's body was [[cremation|cremated]]. The funeral ceremony was held on the beach, where her ashes were scattered into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Approximately 120 people attended, including local officials who had appeared on her show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Special Memorial Service Held On Public Beach For TV Personality Christine Chubbuck |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mz0gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5mYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5894%2C1393341 |date=July 19, 1974 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three songs by Chubbuck's favorite singer, [[Roberta Flack]], were played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Timothy Chubbuck Eulogizes Sister in Beach Service |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=July 18, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] Thomas Beason delivered the [[eulogy]], stating, "We suffer at our sense of loss, we are frightened by her rage, we are guilty in the face of her rejection, we are hurt by her choice of isolation and we are confused by her message."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chris Chubbuck is Eulogized |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=July 18, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chubbuck's show, ''Suncoast Digest'', stayed on the air for several years with new hosts. Simmons, the station director, said Chubbuck's suicide was unrelated to the station. "The crux of the situation was that she was a 29-year-old girl who wanted to be married and who wasn't," he said in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19770801&amp;id=k9UTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7QUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6620,14651 |title='Suncoast Digest' Survives |newspaper=[[Ocala Star-Banner]] |date=August 1, 1977 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The footage of Chubbuck's death has not been seen since its initial airing, and numerous theories on what happened to the footage have been advanced. One was that the station owner Robert Nelson kept it, and it was in the possession of his widowed wife, Mollie. It was confirmed in June 2016 that the footage of Chubbuck's death exists and had indeed been in Robert Nelson's possession, but was handed over to a "very large law firm" for safekeeping by Mollie Nelson. She has no plans on making it publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/06/christine-chubbuck-suicide-video-exists.html |title=The Existence of Christine Chubbuck's Suicide Video Has Been Confirmed |website=Vulture.com |first=Abraham |last=Riesman |date=June 8, 2016 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Greg Chubbuck spoke publicly about his sister for the first time since 1974 in an [[E!]] Entertainment Television special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Christine Chubbuck |series=Boulevard of Broken Dreams |series-link=Boulevard of Broken Dreams (TV series) |network=[[E!]] Television |date=February 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Greg gave an interview to ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, stating that the tape had been locked away and that he had obtained an injunction to ensure that it would never be released.&lt;ref name="Sun Interview" /&gt;

==In popular culture==

In 2003, [[Christopher Sorrentino]] published "Condition," a short story based on Chubbuck's suicide, in the literary magazine ''[[Conjunctions]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=Conjunctions |url=http://www.conjunctions.com/conj40.htm |title=Conjunctions:40 |access-date=November 17, 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005180337/http://www.conjunctions.com/conj40.htm |archive-date=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, two films about Chubbuck played at the [[2016 Sundance Film Festival]]. The first, ''[[Christine (2016 film)|Christine]],'' was directed by Antonio Campos, and starred [[Rebecca Hall]] as Christine Chubbuck and [[Michael C. Hall]] as George Peter Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|4666726|Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/movies/rebecca-hall-interview-christine.html |title=When Rebecca Hall First Got This Script, She Hid It |last=Buckley |first=Cara |work=[[New York Times]] |date=October 9, 2016 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second was the documentary ''[[Kate Plays Christine]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title| 5278592 |Kate Plays Christine (2016)}}&lt;/ref&gt; which depicts actress [[Kate Lyn Sheil]]'s preparation for the part of Chubbuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Guerrasio |first=Jason |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/movie-one-most-horrific-moments-164632666.html |title=A movie about one of the most horrific moments in TV history has become the talk of the Sundance Film Festival |work=Yahoo!

The '''Cimeti√®re des Chiens et Autres Animaux Domestiques''' is often claimed to be the first [[Zoology|zoological]] necropolis in the modern world (the ancient [[Ashkelon dog cemetery]], of course, predates it by thousands of years). It opened in 1899 at 4 pont de Clichy on √éle des Ravageurs in [[Asni√®res-sur-Seine]], [[√éle-de-France]].

This "Cemetery of Dogs and Other Domestic Animals" is an elaborate [[pet cemetery]], the burial site for dogs, cats, and a wide variety of pets ranging from horses to monkeys to lions and even fish.

Located in a northwest suburb of Paris, the pet cemetery caters to a very elite clientele. It contains many ornate sculptures, and at the entry is the monument to [[Barry (dog)|Barry]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostandfond.co.uk/pet-tribute/barry/206 Tribute to Barry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313005727/http://www.lostandfond.co.uk/pet-tribute/barry/206 |date=2012-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[St. Bernard (dog)|Saint Bernard]] mountain rescue dog who died in 1814. The plaque says that during his lifetime, "Barry" was responsible for saving the lives of 40 people lost or trapped in the mountain snow.&lt;ref&gt;Legend has it that the 41st person whom Barry tried to rescue was the one who took the unfortunate dog's life.&lt;/ref&gt; (Barry himself is not buried at the cemetery; his stuffed body is on display at the [[Natural History Museum of Bern|Swiss Natural History Museum in Bern]]).



Some of the cemetery's residents are famous in their own right such as [[Rin Tin Tin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostandfond.co.uk/pet-tribute/rin-tin-tin/237 Tribute to Rin Tin Tin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313063917/http://www.lostandfond.co.uk/pet-tribute/rin-tin-tin/237 |date=2011-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the star of [[Hollywood]] films following his rescue during [[World War I]], while others are the beloved pets of the wealthy who could afford this elaborate burial place such as film director [[Sacha Guitry]]. Buried here too, is the pet lion of stage actress, feminist, and co-founder of the cemetery, [[Marguerite Durand]] and the pet of [[Camille Saint-Sa√´ns]], composer of ''Carnival of the Animals''.

In 1987, the government of France classified the cemetery as a [[Monument historique|historical monument]]. The cemetery presently is owned and managed by the city of Asni√®res and is open to visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asnieres-sur-seine.fr/Tourisme-international/Patrimoine/Le-cimetiere-des-animaux Tourisme International]&lt;/ref&gt;

The impressive entrance to the cemetery was designed by noted architect Eug√®ne Petit in [[Art Nouveau]] style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostandfond.co.uk/news-features/2010-08/tour-parisian-pet-cemetery-cimetiere-du-chiens A tour of Parisian pet cemetery Cimeti√®re des Chiens on Lost &amp; Fond] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222084040/http://www.lostandfond.co.uk/news-features/2010-08/tour-parisian-pet-cemetery-cimetiere-du-chiens |date=2012-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, the gates of the cemetery were reproduced in the city of Curitiba, Paran√° (Brazil), for the entrance of its first urban park, the Public Walk.The reference is indicated on bronze plates next to the construction.

[[Image:RobertFuddBewusstsein17Jh.png|thumb|Representation of consciousness from the seventeenth century by [[Robert Fludd]], an English Paracelsian physician]]

'''Consciousness''' is the state or [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] of [[awareness]] or of being aware of an external object or something within oneself.&lt;ref name="consciousness"&gt;{{cite web|title=consciousness|publisher=Merriam-Webster|location=|accessdate=June 4, 2012|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consciousness}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="van_Gulick2004"&gt;{{cite web |author=Robert van Gulick |year=2004 |title=Consciousness |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined variously in terms of [[sentience]], awareness, [[qualia]], [[subjectivity]], the ability to [[experience]] or to  [[feeling|feel]], [[wakefulness]], having a sense of [[self]]hood or [[soul]], the fact that there is something "that it is like" to "have" or "be" it,  and the executive control system of the [[mind]].&lt;ref name=Farthing1992Psychology&gt;{{cite book| title=The Psychology of Consciousness |author=Farthing G |year=1992 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-728668-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the difficulty in definition, many philosophers believe that there is a broadly shared underlying intuition about what consciousness is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[John Searle]] |year=2005 |editor=Honderich T |title=The Oxford companion to philosophy |chapter=Consciousness |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-926479-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Max Velmans]] and Susan Schneider wrote in ''The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness'': "Anything that we are aware of at a given moment forms part of our consciousness, making conscious experience at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Susan Schneider and [[Max Velmans]] |year=2008 |chapter=Introduction |editors=Max Velmans, Susan Schneider |title=The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-75145-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philosophy#Western philosophy|Western philosophers]], since the time of [[Ren√© Descartes|Descartes]] and [[John Locke|Locke]], have struggled to comprehend the nature of consciousness and identify its essential properties.  Issues of concern in the philosophy of consciousness include whether the concept is fundamentally coherent; whether consciousness can ever be explained [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistically]]; whether [[non-human]] consciousness exists and if so how it can be recognized; how consciousness relates to [[language]]; whether consciousness can be understood in a way that does not require a [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic]] distinction between mental and physical states or properties; and whether it may ever be possible for computing machines like [[computer]]s or [[robot]]s to be conscious, a topic studied in the field of [[artificial intelligence]].

Thanks to developments in technology over the past few decades, consciousness has become a significant topic of interdisciplinary research in [[cognitive science]], with significant contributions from fields such as [[psychology]], anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.cz/books?hl=cs&amp;lr=&amp;id=PKCHAgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Consciousness+in+anthropology&amp;ots=jlAk1G7WkX&amp;sig=B_xQWrB72d-SPL3CXojvKgF_3KM&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Questions of Consciousness|last=Cohen A.P., Rapport N.|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308792484_Quantum_Anthropology_Man_Cultures_and_Groups_in_a_Quantum_Perspective|title=section on consciousness on pp.33-42 in Quantum anthropology: Man, cultures, and groups in a quantum perspective|last=Trnka R., Lorencova R.|first=|publisher=Charles University Karolinum Press|year=2016|isbn=978-80-246-3470-8|location=Prague|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[neuropsychology]] and [[neuroscience]]. The primary focus is on understanding what it means biologically and psychologically for [[information]] to be present in consciousness‚Äîthat is, on determining the neural and psychological correlates of consciousness.  The majority of experimental studies assess consciousness in humans by asking subjects for a verbal report of their experiences (e.g., "tell me if you notice anything when I do this").  Issues of interest include phenomena such as [[subliminal stimuli|subliminal perception]], [[blindsight]], [[anosognosia|denial of impairment]], and [[altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]] produced by alcohol and other drugs, or spiritual or meditative techniques.

In [[medicine]], consciousness is assessed by observing a patient's arousal and responsiveness, and can be seen as a continuum of states ranging from full alertness and comprehension, through disorientation, delirium, loss of meaningful communication, and finally loss of movement in response to painful [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=G√ºven G√ºzeldere |title=The Nature of Consciousness: Philosophical debates |year=1997 |editors=Ned Block, Owen Flanagan, G√ºven G√ºzeldere |pages=1‚Äì67 |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Issues of practical concern include how the presence of consciousness can be assessed in severely ill, comatose, or anesthetized people, and how to treat conditions in which consciousness is impaired or disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Late recovery from the minimally conscious state: ethical and policy implications |authors=J.

==Etymology==
[[File:JohnLocke.png|thumb|right|150px|[[John Locke]], British philosopher active in the 17th century]]
The origin of the modern concept of consciousness is often attributed to [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', published in 1690.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (Chapter XXVII)|last=Locke|first=John|publisher=University of Adelaide|location=Australia|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/l/locke/john/l81u/B2.27.html|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Locke defined consciousness as "the perception of what passes in a man's own mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/133274/consciousness|title=Science &amp; Technology: consciousness|publisher=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His essay influenced the 18th-century view of consciousness, and his definition appeared in [[Samuel Johnson]]'s celebrated ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary]]'' (1755).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of the English Language |authors=[[Samuel Johnson]] |publisher=Knapton |year=1756 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcVEAAAAcAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Consciousness" (French: ''conscience'') is also defined in the 1753 volume of Diderot and d'Alembert's [[Encyclop√©die]], as "the opinion or internal feeling that we ourselves have from what we do." &lt;ref&gt;Jaucourt, Louis, chevalier de. "Consciousness." The Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert Collaborative Translation Project. Translated by Scott St. Louis. Ann Arbor: Michigan Publishing, University of Michigan Library, 2014. http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.did2222.0002.986. Originally published as "Conscience," Encyclop√©die ou Dictionnaire raisonn√© des sciences, des arts et des m√©tiers, 3:902 (Paris, 1753).&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest English language uses of "conscious" and "consciousness" date back, however, to the 1500s.  The English word "conscious" originally derived from the Latin ''conscius'' (''con-'' "together" and [[wikt:scio|''scio'']] "to know"), but the Latin word did not have the same meaning as our word‚Äîit meant "knowing with", in other words "having joint or common [[knowledge]] with another".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies in words |author =[[C. S. Lewis]]|year=1990 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |chapter=Ch. 8: Conscience and conscious |isbn=978-0-521-39831-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were, however, many occurrences in Latin writings of the phrase ''conscius sibi'', which translates literally as "knowing with oneself", or in other words "sharing knowledge with oneself about something".  This phrase had the figurative meaning of "knowing that one knows", as the modern English word "conscious" does.  In its earliest uses in the 1500s, the English word "conscious" retained the meaning of the Latin ''conscius''.  For example, [[Thomas Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' wrote: "Where two, or more men, know of one and the same fact, they are said to be Conscious of it one to another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Leviathan: or, The Matter, Forme &amp; Power of a Commonwealth, Ecclesiasticall and Civill |author=[[Thomas Hobbes]] |publisher=University Press |year=1904 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2oc6AAAAMAAJ |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Latin phrase ''conscius sibi'', whose meaning was more closely related to the current concept of consciousness, was rendered in English as "conscious to oneself" or "conscious unto oneself".  For example, [[Archbishop Ussher]] wrote in 1613 of "being so conscious unto myself of my great weakness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The whole works, Volume 2 |author=[[James Ussher]], [[Charles Richard Elrington]] |page=417 |year=1613 |publisher=Hodges and Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Locke's definition from 1690 illustrates that a gradual shift in meaning had taken place.

A related word was ''[[:la:conscientia|conscientia]]'', which primarily means [[morality|moral]] [[conscience]]. In the literal sense, "conscientia" means knowledge-with, that is, shared knowledge. The word first appears in Latin juridical texts by writers such as [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Dictionary of Untranslatables. A Philosophical Lexicon| authors=Barbara Cassin |publisher=Princeton University Press| isbn=978-0-691-13870-1| year=2014|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, ''conscientia'' is the knowledge that a witness has of the deed of someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=G. Molenaar|title=Seneca's Use of the Term Conscientia|journal=Mnemosyne| volume=22|year=1969|pages=170‚Äì180|doi=10.1163/156852569x00670}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ren√© Descartes]] (1596‚Äì1650) is generally taken to be the first philosopher to use ''conscientia'' in a way that does not fit this traditional meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Boris Hennig |title=Cartesian Conscientia|journal=British Journal for the History of Philosophy |year=2007 |volume=15 |pages=455‚Äì484 |doi=10.1080/09608780701444915}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes used ''conscientia'' the way modern speakers would use "conscience".  In ''Search after Truth'' (''{{lang|la|Regul√¶ ad directionem ingenii ut et inquisitio veritatis per lumen naturale}}'', Amsterdam 1701) he says "conscience or internal testimony" (''conscienti√¢, vel interno testimonio'').&lt;ref&gt;Charles Adam, [[Paul Tannery]] (eds.), ''Oeuvres de Descartes'' X, [https://archive.org/stream/oeuvresdedescar10desc#page/524/mode/2up 524] (1908).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=205‚Äì206 |title=Consciousness: from perception to reflection in the history of philosophy |isbn=978-1-4020-6081-6 |publisher=Springer |author=Sara Hein√§maa, Vili L√§hteenm√§ki, Pauliina Remes (eds.) |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dictionary definitions==
The dictionary meanings of the word ''consciousness'' extend through several centuries and several associated related meanings. These have ranged from formal definitions to definitions attempting to capture the less easily captured and more debated meanings and usage of the word.

One formal definition indicating the range of these related meanings is given in ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'' stating that ''consciousness'' is:
#* ''awareness or perception of an inward psychological or spiritual fact: intuitively perceived knowledge of something in one's inner self''
#* ''inward awareness of an external object, state, or fact''
#* ''concerned awareness: INTEREST, CONCERN‚Äîoften used with an attributive noun. ''
# ''the state or activity that is characterized by sensation, emotion, volition, or thought: mind in the broadest possible sense: something in nature that is distinguished from the physical. ''
# ''the totality in psychology of sensations, perceptions, ideas, attitudes and feelings of which an individual or a group is aware at any given time or within a particular time span‚Äîcompare STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS."''

The [[Cambridge Dictionary]] defines consciousness as "''the state of understanding and realizing something.''"&lt;ref&gt;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/consciousness&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Oxford Living Dictionary]] defines consciousness as "''The state of being aware of and responsive to one's surroundings.''", "''A person's awareness or perception of something.''" and "''The fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world.''"&lt;ref&gt;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/consciousness&lt;/ref&gt;

Most definitions include awareness, but some include a more general state of being.

==Philosophy of mind==
The [[philosophy of mind]] has given rise to many stances regarding consciousness. The ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' in 1998 defines consciousness as follows:
{{quote|'''Consciousness'''‚ÄîPhilosophers have used the term 'consciousness' for four main topics: knowledge in general, intentionality, introspection (and the knowledge it specifically generates) and phenomenal experience... Something within one's mind is 'introspectively conscious' just in case one introspects it (or is poised to do so). Introspection is often thought to deliver one's primary knowledge of one's mental life. An experience or other mental entity is 'phenomenally conscious' just in case there is 'something it is like' for one to have it. The clearest examples are: perceptual experience, such as tastings and seeings; bodily-sensational experiences, such as those of pains, tickles and itches; imaginative experiences, such as those of one's own actions or perceptions; and streams of thought, as in the experience of thinking 'in words' or 'in images'. Introspection and phenomenality seem independent, or dissociable, although this is controversial.&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Edward Craig (philosopher)|Edward Craig]] |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Routledge |chapter=Consciousness |year=1998 |isbn=0415-18707-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a more skeptical definition of ''consciousness'', [[Stuart Sutherland]] has exemplified some of the difficulties in fully ascertaining all of its cognate meanings in his entry for the 1989 version of the ''Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology'':
{{quote|'''Consciousness'''‚ÄîThe having of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings; awareness. The term is impossible to define except in terms that are unintelligible without a grasp of what consciousness means.  Many fall into the trap of equating consciousness with self-consciousness‚Äîto be conscious it is only necessary to be aware of the external world. Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon: it is impossible to specify what it is, what it does, or why it has evolved. Nothing worth reading has been written on it.&lt;ref name=Sutherland&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Stuart Sutherland]] |title=Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology |publisher=Macmillan |chapter=Consciousness |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-333-38829-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Most writers on the philosophy of consciousness have been concerned with defending a particular point of view, and have organized their material accordingly.  For surveys, the most common approach is to follow a historical path by associating stances with the philosophers who are most strongly associated with them, for example Descartes, Locke, Kant, etc. An alternative is to organize philosophical stances according to basic issues.

===The coherence of the concept===
Philosophers and non-philosophers differ in their intuitions about what consciousness is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Justin Sytsma and Edouard Machery |title=Two conceptions of subjective experience |journal=Philosophical Studies |year=2010 |volume=151 |pages=299‚Äì327 |doi=10.1007/s11098-009-9439-x|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00004888/01/Two_Conceptions_of_Subjective_Experience.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; While most people have a strong intuition for the existence of what they refer to as consciousness,&lt;ref name=Antony2001&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michael V. Antony |title=Is ''consciousness'' ambiguous? |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=8 |year=2001 |pages=19‚Äì44}}&lt;/ref&gt; skeptics argue that this intuition is false, either because the concept of consciousness is intrinsically incoherent, or because our intuitions about it are based in illusions.  [[Gilbert Ryle]], for example, argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualist]] outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and body, or between mind and world. He proposed that we speak not of minds, bodies, and the world, but of individuals, or persons, acting in the world. Thus, by speaking of "consciousness" we end up misleading ourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings.&lt;ref name=RyleConsciousness&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Concept of Mind]] |author=[[Gilbert Ryle]] |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1949 |pages=156‚Äì163|isbn=978-0-226-73296-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, many philosophers and scientists have been unhappy about the difficulty of producing a definition that does not involve circularity or fuzziness.&lt;ref name=Sutherland/&gt;

===Types of consciousness===
Many philosophers have argued that consciousness is a unitary concept that is understood intuitively by the majority of people in spite of the difficulty in defining it.&lt;ref name="Antony2001"/&gt;  Others, though, have argued that the level of disagreement about the meaning of the word indicates that it either means different things to different people (for instance, the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] versus [[Subjectivism|subjective]] aspects of consciousness), or else is an [[umbrella term]] encompassing a variety of distinct meanings with no simple element in common.&lt;ref name=Velmans2009&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Max Velmans]] |title=How to define consciousness‚Äîand how not to define consciousness |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |year=2009 |volume=16 |pages=139‚Äì156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ned Block]] proposed a distinction between two types of consciousness that he called ''phenomenal'' (P-consciousness) and ''access'' (A-consciousness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nature of Consciousness: Philosophical Debates |editors=N. Block, O. Flanagan, G. Guzeldere |chapter=On a confusion about a function of consciousness |author=[[Ned Block]] |pages=375‚Äì415 |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-262-52210-6 |publisher=MIT Press |url=http://cogprints.org/231/1/199712004.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  P-consciousness, according to Block, is simply raw experience:  it is moving, colored forms, sounds, sensations, emotions and feelings with our bodies' and responses at the center. These experiences, considered independently of any impact on behavior, are called [[qualia]].  A-consciousness, on the other hand, is the phenomenon whereby information in our minds is accessible for verbal report, reasoning, and the control of behavior. So, when we [[perception|perceive]], information about what we perceive is access conscious; when we [[introspection|introspect]], information about our thoughts is access conscious; when we [[memory|remember]], information about the past is access conscious, and so on.  Although some philosophers, such as [[Daniel Dennett]], have disputed the validity of this distinction,&lt;ref name="D375"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Daniel Dennett]] |year=2004 |title=[[Consciousness Explained]] |page=375 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=0-7139-9037-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; others have broadly accepted it.  [[David Chalmers]] has argued that A-consciousness can in principle be understood in mechanistic terms, but that understanding P-consciousness is much more challenging:  he calls this the [[hard problem of consciousness]].&lt;ref name=ChalmersHardProblem&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/chalmers.html |title=Facing up to the problem of consciousness |author=[[David Chalmers]] |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=2 |year=1995 |pages=200‚Äì219 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308163649/http://www.imprint.co.uk/chalmers.html |archivedate=2005-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers believe that Block's two types of consciousness are not the end of the story.  [[William Lycan]], for example, argued in his book ''Consciousness and Experience'' that at least eight clearly distinct types of consciousness can be identified (organism consciousness; control consciousness; consciousness ''of''; state/event consciousness; reportability; introspective consciousness; subjective consciousness; self-consciousness)‚Äîand that even this list omits several more obscure forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[William Lycan]] |title=Consciousness and Experience |pages=1‚Äì4 |year=1996 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-12197-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also debate over whether or not a-consciousness and p-consciousness always co-exist or if they can exist separately.  Although p-consciousness without a-consciousness is more widely accepted, there have been some hypothetical examples of A without P. Block for instance suggests the case of a ‚Äúzombie‚Äù that is computationally identical to a person but without any subjectivity. However, he remains somewhat skeptical concluding "I don‚Äôt know whether there are any actual cases of A-consciousness without P-consciousness, but I hope I have illustrated their conceptual possibility." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Block N | year = 1995 | title = How many concepts of consciousness? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 272‚Äì84 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00038486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mind‚Äìbody problem===
{{main|Mind‚Äìbody problem}}
[[Image:Descartes mind and body.gif|thumb|200px|right|Illustration of dualism by [[Ren√© Descartes]]. Inputs are passed by the sensory organs to the [[pineal gland]] and from there to the immaterial spirit.]]
Mental processes (such as consciousness) and physical processes (such as brain events) seem to be correlated: but what is the basis of this connection and correlation between what seem to be two very different kinds of processes?

The first influential philosopher to discuss this question specifically was [[Ren√© Descartes|Descartes]], and the answer he gave is known as [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]].  Descartes proposed that consciousness resides within an immaterial domain he called [[mental substance|res cogitans]] (the realm of thought), in contrast to the domain of material things, which he called [[res extensa]] (the realm of extension).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy of Man: selected readings|last=Dy, Jr.|first=Manuel B.|publisher=Goodwill Trading Co.|year=2001|isbn=971-12-0245-X|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He suggested that the interaction between these two domains occurs inside the brain, perhaps in a small midline structure called the [[pineal gland]].&lt;ref name="Stanford_pineal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Descartes and the Pineal Gland|publisher=Stanford University|date=November 5, 2008|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pineal-gland/|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is widely accepted that Descartes explained the problem cogently, few later philosophers have been happy with his solution, and his ideas about the pineal gland have especially been ridiculed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Descartes and the pineal gland |author=Gert-Jan Lokhorst |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/pineal-gland/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no alternative solution has gained general acceptance.  Proposed solutions can be divided broadly into two categories:  [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] solutions that maintain Descartes' rigid distinction between the realm of consciousness and the realm of matter but give different answers for how the two realms relate to each other; and [[monism|monist]] solutions that maintain that there is really only one realm of being, of which consciousness and matter are both aspects.  Each of these categories itself contains numerous variants.  The two main types of dualism are [[substance dualism]] (which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics) and [[property dualism]] (which holds that the laws of physics are universally valid but cannot be used to explain the mind).  The three main types of monism are [[physicalism]] (which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way), [[idealism]] (which holds that only thought or experience truly exists, and matter is merely an illusion), and [[neutral monism]] (which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them).  There are also, however, a large number of idiosyncratic theories that cannot cleanly be assigned to any of these schools of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Jaworski |title=Philosophy of Mind: A Comprehensive Introduction |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4443-3367-1 |pages=5‚Äì11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the dawn of Newtonian science with its vision of simple mechanical principles governing the entire universe, some philosophers have been tempted by the idea that consciousness could be explained in purely physical terms. The first influential writer to propose such an idea explicitly was [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]], in his book ''[[Man a Machine]]'' (''L'homme machine'').  His arguments, however, were very abstract.&lt;ref name=LaMettrie&gt;{{cite book| editor=Ann Thomson |author=[[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] |title=Machine man and other writings |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-521-47849-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most influential modern physical theories of consciousness are based on [[psychology]] and [[neuroscience]]. Theories proposed by neuroscientists such as [[Gerald Edelman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On the Matter of the Mind |author=[[Gerald Edelman]] |publisher=Basic Books |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-465-00764-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ant√≥nio Dam√°sio|Antonio Damasio]],&lt;ref name=DamasioFeeling&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Antonio Damasio]] |year=1999 |title=The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt Press |isbn=978-0-15-601075-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by philosophers such as [[Daniel Dennett]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Daniel Dennett]] |year=1991 |title=Consciousness Explained |location=Boston |publisher=Little &amp; Company |isbn=978-0-316-18066-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; seek to explain consciousness in terms of neural events occurring within the brain. Many other neuroscientists, such as [[Christof Koch]],&lt;ref name=KochQuest&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Christof Koch]] |year=2004 |title=The Quest for Consciousness |location=Englewood CO |publisher=Roberts &amp; Company |isbn=978-0-9747077-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; have explored the neural basis of consciousness without attempting to frame all-encompassing global theories. At the same time, computer scientists working in the field of [[artificial intelligence]] have pursued the goal of creating digital computer programs that can [[Artificial consciousness|simulate or embody consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Ron Sun and Stan Franklin, Computational models of consciousness: A taxonomy and some examples.   In:  P. D. Zelazo, M. Moscovitch, and E. Thompson (eds.), The Cambridge Handbook of Consciousness, pp.151-174. Cambridge University Press, New York. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A few theoretical physicists have argued that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of consciousness, but that [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] may provide [[quantum mind|the missing ingredients]]. Several theorists have therefore proposed [[quantum mind]] (QM) theories of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Stanford_qm_cos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantum Approaches to Consciousness|publisher=Stanford University|date=December 25, 2011|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable theories falling into this category include the [[holonomic brain theory]] of [[Karl H. Pribram|Karl Pribram]] and [[David Bohm]], and the [[Orch-OR|Orch-OR theory]] formulated by [[Stuart Hameroff]] and [[Roger Penrose]]. Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness, as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness. None of the quantum mechanical theories has been confirmed by experiment. Recent publications by G. Guerreshi, J. Cia, S. Popescu, and H. Briegel&lt;ref name="Cai2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.82.021921 |last1=Cai |first1=J. |last2=Popescu |first2=S. |last3=Briegel |first3=H. |title=Persistent dynamic entanglement from classical motion: How bio-molecular machines can generate non-trivial quantum states |journal=Physical Review E |volume=82 |pages=021921 |arxiv=0809.4906 |bibcode=2010PhRvE..82b1921C }}&lt;/ref&gt; could falsify proposals such as those of Hameroff, which rely on [[quantum entanglement]] in protein. At the present time many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=[[John Searle]] |year=1997 |title=The Mystery of Consciousness |publisher=The New York Review of Books |pages=53‚Äì88 |isbn=978-0-940322-06-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the general question of the [[Hard problem of consciousness|"hard problem" of consciousness]], roughly speaking, the question of how mental experience arises from a physical basis,&lt;ref name=Gennaro&gt;

For a discussion see {{cite book |title=The Consciousness Paradox: Consciousness, Concepts, and Higher-Order Thoughts |author= Rocco J. Gennaro |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-XgKMgzwk4C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75 |page=75 |chapter=¬ß4.4 The hard problem of consciousness |isbn=0-262-01660-5 |year=2011 |publisher=MIT Press}}

&lt;/ref&gt; a more specialized question is how to square the subjective notion that we are in control of our decisions (at least in some small measure) with the customary view of causality that subsequent events are caused by prior events. The topic of [[free will]] is the philosophical and scientific examination of this conundrum.

===Problem of other minds===
{{main|Problem of other minds}}

Many philosophers consider experience to be the essence of consciousness, and believe that experience can only fully be known from the inside, subjectively.  But if consciousness is subjective and not visible from the outside, why do the vast majority of people believe that other people are conscious, but rocks and trees are not?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Knobe J |year=2008 |title=Can a Robot, an Insect or God Be Aware? |journal=Scientific American: Mind |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=can-a-robot-an-insect-or |doi=10.1038/scientificamericanmind1208-68 |volume=19 |pages=68‚Äì71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is called the [[problem of other minds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Alec Hyslop |title=Other Minds |year=1995 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-7923-3245-9 |pages=5‚Äì14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is particularly acute for people who believe in the possibility of [[philosophical zombie]]s, that is, people who think it is possible in principle to have an entity that is physically indistinguishable from a human being and behaves like a human being in every way but nevertheless lacks consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Robert Kirk |title=Zombies |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2009 Edition) |editor=Edward N.

The most commonly given answer is that we attribute consciousness to other people because we see that they resemble us in appearance and behavior; we reason that if they look like us and act like us, they must be like us in other ways, including having experiences of the sort that we do.&lt;ref name=HyslopAnalogy/&gt;  There are, however, a variety of problems with that explanation.  For one thing, it seems to violate the [[Occam's razor|principle of parsimony]], by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe.&lt;ref name=HyslopAnalogy&gt;{{cite book|authors=Alec Hyslop |chapter=The analogical inference to other minds |title=Other Minds |year=1995 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-7923-3245-9 |pages=41‚Äì70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some philosophers, such as [[Daniel Dennett]] in an essay titled ''The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies'', argue that people who give this explanation do not really understand what they are saying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=[[Daniel Dennett]] |title=The unimagined preposterousness of zombies |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=2 |year=1995 |pages=322‚Äì325}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More broadly, philosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected in behavior (including verbal behavior), and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior.  A more straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to people because of what they can ''do'', including the fact that they can tell us about their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=[[Stevan Harnad]] |title=Why and how we are not zombies |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |year=1995 |volume=1 |pages=164‚Äì167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal consciousness===
{{see also|Animal consciousness}}

The topic of animal consciousness is beset by a number of difficulties.  It poses the problem of other minds in an especially severe form, because non-human animals, lacking the ability to express human language, cannot tell us about their experiences.&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;{{cite web |author=Colin Allen |title=Animal consciousness |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/consciousness-animal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, it is difficult to reason objectively about the question, because a denial that an animal is conscious is often taken to imply that it does not feel, its life has no value, and that harming it is not morally wrong.  Descartes, for example, has sometimes been blamed for mistreatment of animals due to the fact that he believed only humans have a non-physical mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=[[Peter Carruthers (philosopher)|Peter Carruthers]] |title=Sympathy and subjectivity |journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy |year=1999 |volume=77 |pages=465‚Äì482 |doi=10.1080/00048409912349231}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most people have a strong intuition that some animals, such as cats and dogs, are conscious, while others, such as insects, are not; but the sources of this intuition are not obvious, and are often based on personal interactions with pets and other animals they have observed.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;

Philosophers who consider subjective experience the essence of consciousness also generally believe, as a correlate, that the existence and nature of animal consciousness can never rigorously be known. [[Thomas Nagel]] spelled out this point of view in an influential essay titled ''[[What Is it Like to Be a Bat?]]''.  He said that an organism is conscious "if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism ‚Äî something it is like ''for'' the organism"; and he argued that no matter how much we know about an animal's brain and behavior, we can never really put ourselves into the mind of the animal and experience its world in the way it does itself.&lt;ref name=NagelBat&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Thomas Nagel]] |title=Mortal Questions |chapter=Ch. 12 What is it like to be a bat? |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-521-40676-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other thinkers, such as [[Douglas Hofstadter]], dismiss this argument as incoherent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Douglas Hofstadter]] |chapter=Reflections on ''What Is It Like to Be a Bat?'' |pages=403‚Äì414 |title=[[The Mind's I]] |editors=[[Douglas Hofstadter]] and [[Daniel Dennett]] |publisher=Basic Books |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-7108-0352-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several psychologists and ethologists have argued for the existence of animal consciousness by describing a range of behaviors that appear to show animals holding beliefs about things they cannot directly perceive ‚Äî [[Donald Griffin]]'s 2001 book ''Animal Minds'' reviews a substantial portion of the evidence.&lt;ref name=Griffin2001&gt;{{cite book |title=Animal Minds: Beyond Cognition to Consciousness |author=[[Donald Griffin]] |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-226-30865-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7, 2012, eminent scientists from different branches of neuroscience gathered at the [[University of Cambridge]] to celebrate the Francis Crick Memorial Conference, which deals with consciousness in humans and pre-linguistic consciousness in nonhuman animals. After the conference, they signed in the presence of [[Stephen Hawking]], the 'Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness', which summarizes the most important findings of the survey:

"We decided to reach a consensus and make a statement directed to the public that is not scientific. It's obvious to everyone in this room that animals have consciousness, but it is not obvious to the rest of the world. It is not obvious to the rest of the Western world or the Far East. It is not obvious to the society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSbom5MsfNM|title=Animal Consciousness Officially Recognized by Leading Panel of Neuroscientists|date=3 September 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals [...], including all mammals and birds, and other creatures, [...] have the necessary neural substrates of consciousness and the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf|title=Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artifact consciousness===
{{see also|Artificial consciousness}}

The idea of an [[wikt:artifact|artifact]] made conscious is an ancient theme of mythology, appearing for example in the Greek myth of [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]], who carved a statue that was magically brought to life, and in medieval Jewish stories of the [[Golem]], a magically animated homunculus built of clay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Moshe Idel |title=Golem: Jewish Magical and Mystical Traditions on the Artificial Anthropoid |year=1990 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-7914-0160-6}} Note: In many stories the Golem was mindless, but some gave it emotions or thoughts.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the possibility of actually constructing a conscious machine was probably first discussed by [[Ada Lovelace]], in a set of notes written in 1842 about the [[Analytical Engine]] invented by [[Charles Babbage]], a precursor (never built) to modern electronic computers.  Lovelace was essentially dismissive of the idea that a machine such as the Analytical Engine could think in a humanlike way.  She wrote:

{{quote|It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine.&amp;nbsp;... The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to ''originate'' anything. It can do whatever we ''know how to order it'' to perform. It can ''follow'' analysis; but it has no power of ''anticipating'' any analytical relations or truths. Its province is to assist us in making ''available'' what we are already acquainted with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Ada Lovelace]] |title=Sketch of The Analytical Engine, Note G |url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of the most influential contributions to this question was an essay written in 1950 by pioneering computer scientist [[Alan Turing]], titled ''[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]''.  Turing disavowed any interest in terminology, saying that even "Can machines think?" is too loaded with spurious connotations to be meaningful; but he proposed to replace all such questions with a specific operational test, which has become known as the [[Turing test]].&lt;ref name="tu"&gt;{{cite book |authors=Stuart Shieber |title=The Turing Test : Verbal Behavior as the Hallmark of Intelligence |publisher=MIT Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-262-69293-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To pass the test, a computer must be able to imitate a human well enough to fool interrogators. In his essay Turing discussed a variety of possible objections, and presented a counterargument to each of them.  The Turing test is commonly cited in discussions of [[artificial intelligence]] as a proposed criterion for machine consciousness; it has provoked a great deal of philosophical debate. For example, [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Douglas Hofstadter]] argue that anything capable of passing the Turing test is necessarily conscious,&lt;ref name=MindsI&gt;{{cite book |authors=[[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Douglas Hofstadter]] |year=1985 |title=The Mind's I |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-553-34584-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[David Chalmers]] argues that a [[philosophical zombie]] could pass the test, yet fail to be conscious.&lt;ref name=Chalmers&gt;{{cite book| authors=[[David Chalmers]] |year=1997 |title=The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-511789-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third group of scholars have argued that with technological growth once machines begin to display any substantial signs of human-like behavior then the dichotomy (of human consciousness compared to human-like consciousness) becomes pass√© and issues of machine autonomy begin to prevail even as observed in its nascent form within contemporary industry and technology.&lt;ref name="Ridley Scott pp. 133-144"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Machine Morals 2010"/&gt; [[J√ºrgen Schmidhuber]] argues that consciousness is simply the result of compression.&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber2009"&gt;{{cite book| authors=[[J√ºrgen Schmidhuber]]|year=2009|title="Driven by Compression Progress: A Simple Principle Explains Essential Aspects of Subjective Beauty, Novelty, Surprise, Interestingness, Attention, Curiosity, Creativity, Art, Science, Music, Jokes"}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an agent sees representation of itself recurring in the environment, the compression of this representation can be called consciousness.

In a lively exchange over what has come to be referred to as "the [[Chinese room]] argument", [[John Searle]] sought to refute the claim of proponents of what he calls "strong artificial intelligence (AI)" that a computer program can be conscious, though he does agree with advocates of "weak AI" that computer programs can be formatted to "simulate" conscious states.  His own view is that consciousness has subjective, first-person causal powers by being essentially intentional due simply to the way human brains function biologically; conscious persons can perform computations, but consciousness is not inherently computational the way computer programs are.  To make a Turing machine that speaks Chinese, Searle imagines a room with one monolingual English speaker (Searle himself, in fact), a book that designates a combination of Chinese symbols to be output paired with Chinese symbol input, and boxes filled with Chinese symbols.  In this case, the English speaker is acting as a computer and the rulebook as a program.  Searle argues that with such a machine, he would be able to process the inputs to outputs perfectly without having any understanding of Chinese, nor having any idea what the questions and answers could possibly mean.  If the experiment were done in English, since Searle knows English, he would be able to take questions and give answers without any algorithms for English questions, and he would be effectively aware of what was being said and the purposes it might serve.  Searle would pass the Turing test of answering the questions in both languages, but he is only conscious of what he is doing when he speaks English.  Another way of putting the argument is to say that computer programs can pass the Turing test for processing the syntax of a language, but that the syntax cannot lead to semantic meaning in the way strong AI advocates hoped.&lt;ref name=Searle1990&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[John R. Searle]]|title=Is the brain's mind a computer program |journal=Scientific American |year=1990 |volume= 262|pages=26‚Äì31 |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos116/Is_The_Brains_Mind_A_Computer_Program.pdf |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0190-26 |pmid=2294583|bibcode=1990SciAm.262a..26S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SearleSEP&gt;{{cite web| title=The Chinese Room Argument| url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the literature concerning artificial intelligence, Searle's essay has been second only to Turing's in the volume of debate it has generated.&lt;ref name=Searle1980&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[John Searle]]|title=Minds, brains, and programs |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |year=1980 |volume=3 |pages=417‚Äì457 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00005756|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Searle himself was vague about what extra ingredients it would take to make a machine conscious: all he proposed was that what was needed was "causal powers" of the sort that the brain has and that computers lack. But other thinkers sympathetic to his basic argument have suggested that the necessary (though perhaps still not sufficient) extra conditions may include the ability to pass not just the verbal version of the Turing test, but the [[Robotics|robotic]] version,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Graham Oppy |author2=David Dowe |year=2011 |title=The Turing test |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/turing-test |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2011 Edition)}}&lt;/ref&gt; which requires [[Symbol grounding|grounding]] the robot's words in the robot's sensorimotor capacity to [[Categorization|categorize]] and interact with the things in the world that its words are about, Turing-indistinguishably from a real person. Turing-scale robotics is an empirical branch of research on [[embodied cognition]] and [[situated cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Margaret Wilson |title=Six views of embodied cognition |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review |volume=9 |year=2002 |pages=625‚Äì636 |url=http://philosophy.wisc.edu/shapiro/PHIL951/951articles/wilson.htm |doi=10.3758/BF03196322 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927020804/http://philosophy.wisc.edu/shapiro/PHIL951/951articles/wilson.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Victor Argonov has suggested a non-Turing test for machine consciousness based on machine's ability to produce philosophical judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Victor Argonov |title=Experimental Methods for Unraveling the Mind-body Problem: The Phenomenal Judgment Approach |journal=Journal of Mind and Behavior |volume=35 |year=2014 | pages=51‚Äì70 | url=http://philpapers.org/rec/ARGMAA-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that a deterministic machine must be regarded as conscious if it is able to produces judgments on all problematic properties of consciousness (such as qualia or binding) having no innate (preloaded) philosophical knowledge on these issues, no philosophical discussions while learning, and no informational models of other creatures in its memory (such models may implicitly or explicitly contain knowledge about these creatures‚Äô consciousness). However, this test can be used only to detect, but not refute the existence of consciousness. A positive result proves that machine is conscious but a negative result proves nothing. For example, absence of philosophical judgments may be
caused by lack of the machine‚Äôs intellect, not by absence of consciousness.

==Scientific study==
For many decades, consciousness as a research topic was avoided by the majority of mainstream scientists, because of a general feeling that a phenomenon defined in subjective terms could not properly be studied using objective experimental methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Horst Hendriks-Jansen |title=Catching ourselves in the act: situated activity, interactive emergence, evolution, and human thought |year=1996 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |page=114 |isbn=0-262-08246-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1975 [[George Mandler]] published an influential psychological study which distinguished between slow, serial, and limited conscious processes and fast, parallel and extensive unconscious ones.&lt;ref&gt;Mandler, G. Consciousness: Respectable, useful, and probably necessary. In R.Solso (Ed.)Information processing and cognition: NJ: LEA.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1980s, an expanding community of neuroscientists and psychologists have associated themselves with a field called ''Consciousness Studies'', giving rise to a stream of experimental work published in books,&lt;ref&gt;Mandler, G.  Consciousness recovered: Psychological functions and origins of thought. Philadelphia: John Benjamins. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; journals such as ''[[Consciousness and Cognition]]'', ''[http://www.frontiersin.org/Consciousness_Research Frontiers in Consciousness Research]'', ''[[Psyche (consciousness journal)|Psyche]]'', and the ''[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]]'', along with regular conferences organized by groups such as the [[Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Toward a Science of Consciousness III: The Third Tucson Discussions and Debates |authors=[[Stuart Hameroff]], Alfred Kaszniak, [[David Chalmers]] |chapter=Preface |isbn=978-0-262-58181-3 |publisher=MIT Press |year=1999 |pages=xix‚Äìxx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern medical and psychological investigations into consciousness are based on psychological experiments (including, for example, the investigation of [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] effects using [[subliminal stimuli]]), and on [[case studies]] of alterations in consciousness produced by trauma, illness, or drugs.  Broadly viewed, scientific approaches are based on two core concepts.  The first identifies the content of consciousness with the experiences that are reported by human subjects; the second makes use of the concept of consciousness that has been developed by neurologists and other medical professionals who deal with patients whose behavior is impaired.  In either case, the ultimate goals are to develop techniques for assessing consciousness objectively in humans as well as other animals, and to understand the neural and psychological mechanisms that underlie it.&lt;ref name=KochQuest/&gt;

===Measurement===
[[File:Necker cube.svg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Necker cube]], an ambiguous image]]
Experimental research on consciousness presents special difficulties, due to the lack of a universally accepted [[operational definition]]. In the majority of experiments that are specifically about consciousness, the subjects are human, and the criterion used is verbal report:  in other words, subjects are asked to describe their experiences, and their descriptions are treated as observations of the contents of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=[[Bernard Baars]] |title=A Cognitive Theory of Consciousness |year=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42743-2| pages=15‚Äì18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, subjects who stare continuously at a [[Necker cube]] usually report that they experience it "flipping" between two 3D configurations, even though the stimulus itself remains the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Perception: Theory, Development, and Organization |authors=Paul Rooks and Jane Wilson |year=2000 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-19094-7 |pages=25‚Äì26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The objective is to understand the relationship between the conscious awareness of stimuli (as indicated by verbal report) and the effects the stimuli have on brain activity and behavior. In several paradigms, such as the technique of [[response priming]], the behavior of subjects is clearly influenced by stimuli for which they report no awareness, and suitable experimental manipulations can lead to increasing priming effects despite decreasing prime identification (double dissociation).&lt;ref name=Schmidt&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Thomas Schmidt and Dirk Vorberg |title=Criteria for unconscious cognition: Three types of dissociation |journal=Perception and Psychophysics |volume=68 |year=2006 |pages=489‚Äì504 |doi=10.3758/bf03193692 |pmid=16900839 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Verbal report is widely considered to be the most reliable indicator of consciousness, but it raises a number of issues.&lt;ref name=Destrebecqz/&gt;  For one thing, if verbal reports are treated as observations, akin to observations in other branches of science, then the possibility arises that they may contain errors‚Äîbut it is difficult to make sense of the idea that subjects could be wrong about their own experiences, and even more difficult to see how such an error could be detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Quining qualia |authors=[[Daniel Dennett]] |title=Consciousness in Modern Science |editors=A. Marcel and E. Bisiach |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1992 |url=http://cogprints.org/254/ |accessdate=2011-10-31 |isbn=978-0-19-852237-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Daniel Dennett]] has argued for an approach he calls [[heterophenomenology]], which means treating verbal reports as stories that may or may not be true, but his ideas about how to do this have not been widely adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Daniel Dennett]] |year=2003 |title=Who's on first? Heterophenomenology explained |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=10 |pages=19‚Äì30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another issue with verbal report as a criterion is that it restricts the field of study to humans who have language:  this approach cannot be used to study consciousness in other species, pre-linguistic children, or people with types of brain damage that impair language.  As a third issue, philosophers who dispute the validity of the [[Turing test]] may feel that it is possible, at least in principle, for verbal report to be dissociated from consciousness entirely:  a [[philosophical zombie]] may give detailed verbal reports of awareness in the absence of any genuine awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=[[David Chalmers]] |title=The Conscious Mind |year=1996 |chapter=Ch. 3: Can consciousness be reductively explained? |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-511789-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although verbal report is in practice the "gold standard" for ascribing consciousness, it is not the only possible criterion.&lt;ref name=Destrebecqz&gt;{{cite book |title=The Boundaries of Consciousness: Neurobiology and Neuropathology |chapter=Methods for studying unconscious learning |authors=Arnaud Destrebecqz and Philippe Peigneux |editor=Steven Laureys |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-444-52876-6 |pages=69‚Äì80}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In medicine, consciousness is assessed as a combination of verbal behavior, arousal, brain activity and purposeful movement.  The last three of these can be used as indicators of consciousness when verbal behavior is absent.&lt;ref name=Giacino/&gt;  The scientific literature regarding the neural bases of arousal and purposeful movement is very extensive.  Their reliability as indicators of consciousness is disputed, however, due to numerous studies showing that alert human subjects can be induced to behave purposefully in a variety of ways in spite of reporting a complete lack of awareness.&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt;  Studies of the [[neuroscience of free will]] have also shown that the experiences that people report when they behave purposefully sometimes do not correspond to their actual behaviors or to the patterns of electrical activity recorded from their brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Human volition: towards a neuroscience of will |authors=Patrick Haggard |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |year=2008 |volume=9 |pages=934‚Äì946 |pmid=19020512 |doi=10.1038/nrn2497 |issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach applies specifically to the study of [[self-awareness]], that is, the ability to distinguish oneself from others.  In the 1970s [[Gordon G. Gallup|Gordon Gallup]] developed an operational test for self-awareness, known as the [[mirror test]].  The test examines whether animals are able to differentiate between seeing themselves in a mirror versus seeing other animals. The classic example involves placing a spot of coloring on the skin or fur near the individual's forehead and seeing if they attempt to remove it or at least touch the spot, thus indicating that they recognize that the individual they are seeing in the mirror is themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Gordon G. Gallup|Gordon Gallup]] |title=Chimpanzees: Self recognition |journal=Science |volume=167 |pages=86‚Äì87 |year=1970 |doi=10.1126/science.167.3914.86 |pmid=4982211 |issue=3914|bibcode=1970Sci...167...86G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Humans (older than 18 months) and other [[Hominidae|great apes]], [[bottlenose dolphin]]s, [[killer whale]]s, [[Columbidae|pigeons]], [[Eurasian magpie|European magpies]] and [[elephants]] have all been observed to pass this test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Animal consciousness: a synthetic approach |authors=David Edelman and Anil Seth |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |year=2009 |volume=32 |pages=476‚Äì484 |pmid=19716185 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2009.05.008 |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neural correlates===
[[File:Neural Correlates Of Consciousness.jpg|thumb|right|550px|{{center|Schema of the neural processes underlying consciousness, from [[Christof Koch]]}}]]

A major part of the scientific literature on consciousness consists of studies that examine the relationship between the experiences reported by subjects and the activity that simultaneously takes place in their brains‚Äîthat is, studies of the [[neural correlates of consciousness]].  The hope is to find that activity in a particular part of the brain, or a particular pattern of global brain activity, which will be strongly predictive of conscious awareness.  Several brain imaging techniques, such as [[EEG]] and [[fMRI]], have been used for physical measures of brain activity in these studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authors=[[Christof Koch]] |year=2004 |title=The Quest for Consciousness |location=Englewood CO |publisher=Roberts &amp; Company |isbn=978-0-9747077-0-9 |pages=16‚Äì19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another idea that has drawn attention for several decades is that consciousness is associated with high-frequency (gamma band) [[neural oscillations|oscillations in brain activity]].  This idea arose from proposals in the 1980s, by Christof von der Malsburg and Wolf Singer, that gamma oscillations could solve the so-called [[binding problem]], by linking information represented in different parts of the brain into a unified experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Binding by synchrony |author=Wolf Singer |publisher=[[Scholarpedia]] |url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Binding_by_synchrony |accessdate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rodolfo Llin√°s]], for example, proposed that consciousness results from [[recurrent thalamo-cortical resonance]] where the specific thalamocortical systems (content) and the non-specific (centromedial thalamus) thalamocortical systems (context) interact in the [[gamma wave|gamma]] band frequency via synchronous oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Rodolfo Llin√°s]] |year=2002 |title=I of the Vortex.

A number of studies have shown that activity in primary sensory areas of the brain is not sufficient to produce consciousness:  it is possible for subjects to report a lack of awareness even when areas such as the [[primary visual cortex]] show clear electrical responses to a stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, ''The Quest for Consciousness'', pp. 105‚Äì116&lt;/ref&gt;  Higher brain areas are seen as more promising, especially the [[prefrontal cortex]], which is involved in a range of higher cognitive functions collectively known as [[executive functions]].  There is substantial evidence that a "top-down" flow of neural activity (i.e., activity propagating from the frontal cortex to sensory areas) is more predictive of conscious awareness than a "bottom-up" flow of activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A framework for consciousness |authors=[[Francis Crick]] and [[Christof Koch]] |year=2003 |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=6 |pages=119‚Äì126 |pmid=12555104 |url=http://papers.klab.caltech.edu/29/1/438.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1038/nn0203-119 |issue=2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522054447/http://papers.klab.caltech.edu/29/1/438.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prefrontal cortex is not the only candidate area, however:  studies by [[Nikos Logothetis]] and his colleagues have shown, for example, that visually responsive neurons in parts of the [[temporal lobe]] reflect the visual perception in the situation when conflicting visual images are presented to different eyes (i.e., bistable percepts during binocular rivalry).&lt;ref&gt;Koch, ''The Quest for Consciousness'', pp. 269‚Äì286&lt;/ref&gt;

Modulation of neural responses may correlate with phenomenal experiences. In contrast to the raw electrical responses that do not correlate with consciousness, the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with an important aspect of consciousness: namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity (brightness, contrast). In the research group of Danko Nikoliƒá it has been shown that some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Biederlack J. |author2=Castelo-Branco M. |author3=Neuenschwander S. |author4=Wheeler D.W. |author5=Singer W. |author6=Nikoliƒá D. | year = 2006 | title = Brightness induction: Rate enhancement and neuronal synchronization as complementary codes | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 1073‚Äì1083 | doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2006.11.012 | pmid=17178409}}&lt;/ref&gt; An fMRI investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Williams Adrian L. |author2=Singh Krishna D. |author3=Smith Andrew T. | year = 2003 | title = Surround modulation measured with functional MRI in the human visual cortex | url = | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | volume = 89 | issue = 1| pages = 525‚Äì533 | doi=10.1152/jn.00048.2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that, in the primary visual areas, changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural correlates of qualia‚Äîat least for some type of qualia.

In 2011, [[Michael Graziano|Graziano]] and Kastner&lt;ref name="Graziano&amp;Kastner2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Graziano, M.S.A.  |author2=Kastner, S | year=2011 | title=Human consciousness and its relationship to social neuroscience: A novel hypothesis | journal=Cog.

In that theory, specific cortical areas, notably in the superior temporal sulcus and the temporo-parietal junction, are used to build the construct of awareness and attribute it to other people. The same cortical machinery is also used to attribute awareness to oneself. Damage to these cortical regions can lead to deficits in consciousness such as [[hemispatial neglect]]. In the [[attention]] schema theory, the value of explaining the feature of awareness and attributing it to a person is to gain a useful predictive model of that person's attentional processing. [[Attention]] is a style of [[information processing]] in which a brain focuses its resources on a limited set of interrelated signals. Awareness, in this theory, is a useful, simplified schema that represents attentional states. To be aware of X is explained by constructing a model of one's attentional focus on X.

In the 2013, the perturbational complexity index (PCI) was proposed, a measure of the algorithmic complexity of the electrophysiological response of the cortex to [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]]. This measure was shown to be higher in individuals that are awake, in REM sleep or in a locked-in state than in those who are in deep sleep or in a vegetative state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Adenauer G.

Assuming that not only humans but even some non-mammalian species are conscious, a number of evolutionary approaches to the problem of neural correlates of consciousness open up. For example, assuming that birds are conscious ‚Äî a common assumption among neuroscientists and ethologists due to the extensive cognitive repertoire of birds ‚Äî there are comparative neuroanatomical ways to validate some of the principal, currently competing, mammalian consciousness‚Äìbrain theories. The rationale for such a comparative study is that the avian brain deviates structurally from the mammalian brain. So how similar are they? What homologues can be identified? The general conclusion from the study by Butler, et al.,&lt;ref name=Butler2005&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ann B. Butler |author2=Paul R.

The structures assumed to be critical for consciousness in mammalian brains have homologous counterparts in avian brains. Thus the main portions of the theories of Crick and Koch,&lt;ref name="Crick1995"/&gt; Edelman and Tononi,&lt;ref name="Edelman2000"/&gt; and Cotterill &lt;ref name="Cotterill2001"/&gt; seem  to be compatible with the assumption that birds are conscious. Edelman also differentiates between what he calls primary consciousness (which is a trait shared by humans and non-human animals) and higher-order consciousness as it appears in humans alone along with human language capacity.&lt;ref name="Edelman2000"/&gt; Certain aspects of the three theories, however, seem less easy to apply to the hypothesis of avian consciousness. For instance, the suggestion by Crick and Koch that layer 5 neurons of the mammalian brain have a special role, seems difficult to apply to the avian brain, since the avian homologues have a different morphology. Likewise, the theory of Eccles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| year=1982 |author=[[John Eccles (neurophysiologist)|J.C.

The assumption of an avian consciousness also brings the reptilian brain into focus. The reason is the structural continuity between avian and reptilian brains, meaning that the phylogenetic origin of consciousness may be earlier than suggested by many leading neuroscientists.

[[Joaquin Fuster]] of UCLA has advocated the position of the importance of the prefrontal cortex in humans, along with the areas of Wernicke and Broca, as being of particular importance to the development of human language capacities neuro-anatomically necessary for the emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Joaquin Fuster, ''The Prefrontal Cortex'', Second Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological function and evolution===
Opinions are divided as to where in biological [[evolution]] consciousness emerged and about whether or not consciousness has any survival value. Some argue that consciousness is a byproduct of evolution. It has been argued that consciousness emerged (i) exclusively with the first humans, (ii) exclusively with the first mammals, (iii) independently in mammals and birds, or (iv) with the first reptiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Peter √Örhem, B.

[[Thomas Henry Huxley]] defends in an essay titled ''On the Hypothesis that Animals are [[Automaton|Automata]], and its History'' an [[epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenalist]] theory of consciousness according to which consciousness is a causally inert effect of neural activity ‚Äî ‚Äúas the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=[[T.

Huxley]] |title=On the hypothesis that animals are automata, and its history |journal=The Fortnightly Review |volume=16 |pages=555‚Äì580|year=1874}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this [[William James]] objects in his essay ''Are We Automata?'' by stating an evolutionary argument for mind-brain interaction implying that if the preservation and development of consciousness in the biological evolution is a result of [[natural selection]], it is plausible that consciousness has not only been influenced by neural processes, but has had a survival value itself; and it could only have had this if it had been efficacious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=[[William James|W.

Regarding the primary function of conscious processing, a recurring idea in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and information-processing that would otherwise be independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=[[Bernard Baars]] |title=The conscious access hypothesis: Origins and recent evidence |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=6 |pages=47‚Äì52 |pmid=11849615 |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01819-2 |issue=1 |date=January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been called the ''integration consensus''. Another example has been proposed by [[Gerald Edelman]] called dynamic core hypothesis which puts emphasis on [[reentry (neural circuitry)|reentrant]] connections that reciprocally link areas of the brain in a massively parallel manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seth|first=Anil|author2=Eugene Izhikevich |author3=George Reeke |author4=Gerald Edelman |title=Theories and measures of consciousness: An extended framework|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2006|volume=103|issue=28|doi=10.1073/pnas.0604347103 |pages=10799‚Äì10804 |pmid=16818879 |pmc=1487169|bibcode=2006PNAS..10310799S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edelman also stresses the importance of the evolutionary emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans from the historically older trait of primary consciousness which humans share with non-human animals (see ''[[#Neural correlates|Neural correlates]]'' section above). These theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness: differentiation and unity. They show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details (differentiation) because it integrates those details from our sensory systems, while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts. However, it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays, nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness. Obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity related to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyses, etc.) and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness, as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Ezequiel Morsella |year=2005 |title=The function of phenomenal states: Supramodular Interaction Theory |journal=Psychological Review |volume=112 |pages=1000‚Äì1021 |pmid=16262477 |issue=4 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.112.4.1000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious. For a review of the differences between conscious and unconscious integrations, see the article of E. Morsella.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

As noted earlier, even among writers who consider consciousness to be a well-defined thing, there is [[Animal consciousness|widespread dispute]] about which animals other than humans can be said to possess it.&lt;ref name = "ingvww"&gt;{{cite book |author=S. Budiansky |title=If a Lion Could Talk: Animal Intelligence and the Evolution of Consciousness |year=1998 |publisher=The Free Press |isbn=978-0-684-83710-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edelman has described this distinction as that of humans possessing higher-order consciousness while sharing the trait of primary consciousness with non-human animals (see previous paragraph). Thus, any examination of the evolution of consciousness is faced with great difficulties.  Nevertheless, some writers have argued that consciousness can be viewed from the standpoint of  [[evolutionary biology]] as an [[adaptation]] in the sense of a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] that increases [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=S.

Other philosophers, however, have suggested that consciousness would not be necessary for any functional advantage in evolutionary processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| authors=[[Owen Flanagan]] and T.

===States of consciousness===
[[File:Abbot of Watkungtaphao in Phu Soidao Waterfall.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A Buddhist monk meditating]]
There are some brain states in which consciousness seems to be absent, including dreamless sleep, coma, and death.  There are also a variety of circumstances that can change the relationship between the mind and the world in less drastic ways, producing what are known as [[altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]].  Some altered states occur naturally; others can be produced by drugs or brain damage.&lt;ref name=Vaitl&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Dieter Vaitl |title=Psychobiology of altered states of consciousness |year=2005 |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=131 |pages=98‚Äì127 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.131.1.98 |pmid=15631555 |issue=1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altered states can be accompanied by changes in thinking, disturbances in the sense of time, feelings of loss of control, changes in emotional expression, alternations in body image and changes in meaning or significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schacter|first1=Daniel|last2=Gilbert|first2=Daniel|last3=Wegner|first3=Daniel|title=Psychology 2nd Ed.|year=2011|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=41 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10010|page=190|isbn=1-4292-3719-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two most widely accepted altered states are [[sleep]] and [[dream]]ing.  Although dream sleep and non-dream sleep appear very similar to an outside observer, each is associated with a distinct pattern of brain activity, metabolic activity, and eye movement;  each is also associated with a distinct pattern of experience and cognition.  During ordinary non-dream sleep, people who are awakened report only vague and sketchy thoughts, and their experiences do not cohere into a continuous narrative.  During dream sleep, in contrast, people who are awakened report rich and detailed experiences in which events form a continuous progression, which may however be interrupted by bizarre or fantastic intrusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Anton Coenen |title=Subconscious Stimulus Recognition and Processing During Sleep | url = http://journalpsyche.org/archive/volume-16-no-2-2010/ |year=2010 |journal=Psyche |volume=16-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thought processes during the dream state frequently show a high level of irrationality.  Both dream and non-dream states are associated with severe disruption of memory:  it usually disappears in seconds during the non-dream state, and in minutes after awakening from a dream unless actively refreshed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=[[J. Allan Hobson]], Edward F.

Research conducted on the effects of partial epileptic seizures on consciousness found that patients who suffer from partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, M., Valli, K., Revonsuo, A., &amp; Wedlund, J., 2008.

Studies found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures, patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the experience of the seizure, followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention.

A variety of [[psychoactive drug]]s, including [[Ethanol|alcohol]], have notable effects on consciousness.&lt;ref name="DSMIV"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV | url = https://books.google.com/?id=W-BGAAAAMAAJ | date = 31 July 1994 | publisher = American Psychiatric Association | location = Washington, DC | isbn = 978-0-89042-025-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These range from a simple dulling of awareness produced by [[sedative]]s, to increases in the intensity of sensory qualities produced by [[stimulant]]s, [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], empathogens‚Äìentactogens such as MDMA ("Ecstasy"), or most notably by the class of drugs known as [[psychedelic drug|psychedelics]].&lt;ref name=Vaitl/&gt; [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], [[mescaline]], [[psilocybin]], [[Dimethyltryptamine]], and others in this group can produce major distortions of perception, including hallucinations; some users even describe their drug-induced experiences as mystical or spiritual in quality. The brain mechanisms underlying these effects are not as well understood as those induced by use of [[Ethanol|alcohol]],&lt;ref name="DSMIV"/&gt; but there is substantial evidence that alterations in the brain system that uses the chemical neurotransmitter [[serotonin]] play an essential role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Lyvers |title=The neurochemistry of psychedelic experiences |year=2003 |publisher=ePublications@bond |url=http://epublications.bond.edu.au/hss_pubs/10 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some research into physiological changes in yogis and people who practise various techniques of meditation.  Some research with brain waves during meditation has reported differences between those corresponding to ordinary relaxation and those corresponding to meditation.  It has been disputed, however, whether there is enough evidence to count these as physiologically distinct states of consciousness.&lt;ref name=MurphyMeditation&gt;{{cite book |authors=M. Murphy, S.

The most extensive study of the characteristics of altered states of consciousness was made by psychologist [[Charles Tart]] in the 1960s and 1970s.  Tart analyzed a state of consciousness as made up of a number of component processes, including exteroception (sensing the external world); interoception (sensing the body); input-processing (seeing meaning); emotions; memory; time sense; sense of identity; evaluation and cognitive processing; motor output; and interaction with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Charles Tart]] |title=States of Consciousness |chapter=Ch. 2: The components of consciousness |year=2001 |publisher=IUniverse.com |isbn=978-0-595-15196-7 |url=http://www.psychedelic-library.org/soc2.htm |accessdate=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these, in his view, could be altered in multiple ways by drugs or other manipulations.  The components that Tart identified have not, however, been validated by empirical studies.  Research in this area has not yet reached firm conclusions, but a recent questionnaire-based study identified eleven significant factors contributing to drug-induced states of consciousness:  experience of unity; spiritual experience; blissful state; insightfulness; disembodiment; impaired control and cognition; anxiety; complex imagery; elementary imagery; audio-visual [[synesthesia]]; and changed meaning of percepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Psychometric evaluation of the altered states of consciousness rating scale (OAV)| authors=E.

===Phenomenology===
Phenomenology is a method of inquiry that attempts to examine the structure of consciousness in its own right, putting aside problems regarding the relationship of consciousness to the physical world. This approach was first proposed by the philosopher [[Edmund Husserl]], and later elaborated by other philosophers and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert Sokolowski |title=Introduction to Phenomenology |year=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=211‚Äì227 |isbn=978-0-521-66792-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Husserl's original concept gave rise to two distinct lines of inquiry, in philosophy and psychology. [[phenomenology (philosophy)|In philosophy]], phenomenology has largely been devoted to fundamental metaphysical questions, such as the nature of [[intentionality]] (''"aboutness"''). [[phenomenology (psychology)|In psychology]], phenomenology largely has meant attempting to investigate consciousness using the method of [[introspection]], which means looking into one's own mind and reporting what one observes. This method fell into disrepute in the early twentieth century because of grave doubts about its reliability, but has been rehabilitated to some degree, especially when used in combination with techniques for examining brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Trusting the Subject?: The Use of Introspective Evidence in Cognitive Science, Volume 1 |editors=Anthony Jack, Andreas Roepstorff |publisher=Imprint Academic |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-907845-56-0 |chapter=Valid and non-reactive verbalization of thoughts during performance of tasks: towards a solution to the central problems of introspection as a source of scientific evidence |author=[[K.

Introspectively, the world of conscious experience seems to have considerable structure.  [[Immanuel Kant]] asserted that the world as we perceive it is organized according to a set of fundamental "intuitions", which include 'object' (we perceive the world as a set of distinct things); 'shape'; 'quality' (color, warmth, etc.); 'space' (distance, direction, and location); and 'time'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kant's view of the mind and consciousness of self |author=Andrew Brook |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-mind/#3.2.1}}  Note: translating Kant's terminology into English is often difficult.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these constructs, such as space and time, correspond to the way the world is structured by the laws of physics; for others the correspondence is not as clear. Understanding the physical basis of qualities, such as redness or pain, has been particularly challenging. David Chalmers has called this the [[hard problem of consciousness]].&lt;ref name=ChalmersHardProblem /&gt; Some philosophers have argued that it is intrinsically unsolvable, because qualities ("[[qualia]]") are [[ineffability|ineffable]]; that is, they are "raw feels", incapable of being analyzed into component processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=On leaving out what it's like |author=[[Joseph Levine (philosopher)|Joseph Levine]] |title=The Nature of Consciousness: Philosophical Debates |editors=N. Block, O. Flanagan, G. Guzeldere |year=1998 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-52210-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other psychologists and neuroscientists reject these arguments. For example, research on [[ideasthesia]] shows that qualia are organised into a semantic-like network. Nevertheless, it is clear that the relationship between a physical entity such as light and a perceptual quality such as color is extraordinarily complex and indirect, as demonstrated by a variety of [[optical illusion]]s such as [[neon color spreading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Science of Color |editor=Steven K. Shevell |chapter=Color appearance |author=Steven K. Shevell |pages=149‚Äì190 |year=2003 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-444-51251-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In neuroscience, a great deal of effort has gone into investigating how the perceived world of conscious awareness is constructed inside the brain. The process is generally thought to involve two primary mechanisms: (1) hierarchical processing of sensory inputs, and (2) memory. Signals arising from sensory organs are transmitted to the brain and then processed in a series of stages, which extract multiple types of information from the raw input. In the visual system, for example, sensory signals from the eyes are transmitted to the [[thalamus]] and then to the [[primary visual cortex]]; inside the cerebral cortex they are sent to areas that extract features such as three-dimensional structure, shape, color, and motion.&lt;ref name=BennettHacker&gt;{{cite book |title=Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience |authors=M. R. Bennett and Peter Michael Stephan Hacker |year=2003 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4051-0838-6 |pages=121‚Äì147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memory comes into play in at least two ways. First, it allows sensory information to be evaluated in the context of previous experience. Second, and even more importantly, [[working memory]] allows information to be integrated over time so that it can generate a stable representation of the world‚Äî[[Gerald Edelman]] expressed this point vividly by titling one of his books about consciousness ''The Remembered Present''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Gerald Edelman]] |title=The Remembered Present: A Biological Theory of Consciousness |publisher=Basic Books |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-465-06910-1 |pages=109‚Äì118}}&lt;/ref&gt; In computational neuroscience, [[Bayesian approaches to brain function]] have been used to understand both the evaluation of sensory information in light of previous experience, and the integration of information over time. Bayesian models of the brain are probabilistic inference models, in which the brain takes advantage of prior knowledge to interpret uncertain sensory inputs in order to formulate a conscious percept; Bayesian models have successfully predicted many perceptual phenomena in vision and the nonvisual senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Knill DC | year = 2007 | title = Learning Bayesian priors for depth perception | url = http://journalofvision.org//7/8/13/ | journal = Journal of Vision | volume = 7 | issue = 8| pages = 1‚Äì20 | doi = 10.1167/7.8.13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Battaglia PW, Jacobs RA, Aslin RN | year = 2003 | title = Bayesian integration of visual and auditory signals for spatial localization | url = http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josaa-20-7-1391 | journal = Journal of the Optical Society of America | volume = 20 | issue = 7| pages = 1391‚Äì7 | doi=10.1364/josaa.20.001391| bibcode = 2003JOSAA..20.1391B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldreich|first=Daniel|author2=Tong, Jonathan|title=Prediction, Postdiction, and Perceptual Length Contraction: A Bayesian Low-Speed Prior Captures the Cutaneous Rabbit and Related Illusions|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=10 May 2013|volume=4|issue=221|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00221|url=http://www.frontiersin.org/consciousness_research/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00221/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the large amount of information available, many important aspects of perception remain mysterious. A great deal is known about low-level signal processing in sensory systems. However, how sensory systems, action systems, and language systems interact are poorly understood. At a deeper level, there are still basic conceptual issues that remain unresolved.&lt;ref name=BennettHacker/&gt;  Many scientists have found it difficult to reconcile the fact that information is distributed across multiple brain areas with the apparent unity of consciousness: this is one aspect of the so-called [[binding problem]].&lt;ref&gt;Koch, ''The Quest for Consciousness'', pp. 167‚Äì170&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some scientists who have expressed grave reservations about the idea that the brain forms representations of the outside world at all: influential members of this group include psychologist [[James J. Gibson|J. J. Gibson]] and roboticist [[Rodney Brooks]], who both argued in favor of "intelligence without representation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=[[Rodney Brooks]] |title=Intelligence without representation |year=1991 |journal=Artificial Intelligence |volume=47 |pages=139‚Äì159 |doi=10.1016/0004-3702(91)90053-M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical aspects==
The medical approach to consciousness is practically oriented.   It derives from a need to treat people whose brain function has been impaired as a result of disease, brain damage, toxins, or drugs.  In medicine, conceptual distinctions are considered useful to the degree that they can help to guide treatments.   Whereas the philosophical approach to consciousness focuses on its fundamental nature and its contents, the medical approach focuses on the amount of consciousness a person has:  in medicine, consciousness is assessed as a "level" ranging from coma and brain death at the low end, to full alertness and purposeful responsiveness at the high end.&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld&gt;{{cite book |title=The Neurology of Consciousness: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuropathology |editors=Steven Laureys, Giulio Tononi |chapter=The neurological examination of consciousness |author=Hal Blumenfeld |year=2009 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-374168-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consciousness is of concern to patients and physicians, especially [[neurology|neurologists]] and [[anesthesia|anesthesiologists]]. Patients may suffer from disorders of consciousness, or may need to be anesthetized for a surgical procedure.  Physicians may perform consciousness-related interventions such as instructing the patient to sleep, administering [[general anesthesia]], or inducing [[induced coma|medical coma]].&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld/&gt; Also, [[bioethics|bioethicists]] may be concerned with the ethical implications of consciousness in medical cases of patients such as the [[Karen Ann Quinlan case]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kinney HC, Korein J, Panigrahy A, Dikkes P, Goode R |date=26 May 1994|issue=21|journal=N Engl J Med|pages=1469‚Äì1475|pmid=8164698|title=Neuropathological findings in the brain of Karen Ann Quinlan -- the role of the thalamus in the persistent vegetative state|volume=330|doi=10.1056/NEJM199405263302101}}&lt;/ref&gt; while neuroscientists may study patients with impaired consciousness in hopes of gaining information about how the brain works.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, ''The Quest for Consciousness'', pp. 216‚Äì226&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment===
In medicine, consciousness is examined using a set of procedures known as [[neuropsychological assessment]].&lt;ref name=Giacino&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J. T. Giacino |author2=C. M. Smart |year=2007 |doi=10.1097/WCO.0b013e3282f189ef |journal=Current Opinion in Neurology |pages=614‚Äì619 |pmid=17992078 |title=Recent advances in behavioral assessment of individuals with disorders of consciousness |volume=20 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two commonly used methods for assessing the level of consciousness of a patient: a simple procedure that requires minimal training, and a more complex procedure that requires substantial expertise.  The simple procedure begins by asking whether the patient is able to move and react to physical stimuli.  If so, the next question is whether the patient can respond in a meaningful way to questions and commands.  If so, the patient is asked for name, current location, and current day and time.  A patient who can answer all of these questions is said to be "alert and oriented times four" (sometimes denoted "A&amp;Ox4" on a medical chart), and is usually considered fully conscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Essentials of Abnormal Psychology |authors=V. Mark Durand and David H. Barlow |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-495-59982-1 |pages=74‚Äì75}}  Note: A patient who can additionally describe the current situation may be referred to as "oriented times four".&lt;/ref&gt;

The more complex procedure is known as a [[neurological examination]], and is usually carried out by a [[neurology|neurologist]] in a hospital setting.  A formal neurological examination runs through a precisely delineated series of tests, beginning with tests for basic sensorimotor reflexes, and culminating with tests for sophisticated use of language.  The outcome may be summarized using the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]], which yields a number in the range 3‚Äî15, with a score of 3 to 8 indicating coma, and 15 indicating full consciousness.  The Glasgow Coma Scale has three subscales, measuring the best motor response (ranging from "no motor response" to "obeys commands"), the best eye response (ranging from "no eye opening" to "eyes opening spontaneously") and the best verbal response (ranging from "no verbal response" to "fully oriented").  There is also a simpler [[Paediatric Glasgow Coma Scale|pediatric]] version of the scale, for children too young to be able to use language.&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld/&gt;

In 2013, an experimental procedure was developed to measure degrees of consciousness, the procedure involving stimulating the brain with a magnetic pulse, measuring resulting waves of electrical activity, and developing a consciousness score based on the complexity of the brain activity.&lt;ref name=NBCnews20130814&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/new-tool-peeks-brain-measure-consciousness-6C10919906 |title=New tool peeks into brain to measure consciousness |last=Neergaard |first=Lauren |date=August 14, 2013 |publisher=Associated Press through NBC News |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IsYP826u?url=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/new-tool-peeks-brain-measure-consciousness-6C10919906 |archivedate=August 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disorders of consciousness===
Medical conditions that inhibit consciousness are considered [[disorders of consciousness]].&lt;ref name="chronic"/&gt; This category generally includes [[minimally conscious state]] and [[persistent vegetative state]], but sometimes also includes the less severe [[locked-in syndrome]] and more severe [[coma|chronic coma]].&lt;ref name="chronic"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bernat JL|date=8 Apr 2006|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68508-5|issue=9517|journal=Lancet|pages=1181‚Äì1192|pmid=16616561|title=Chronic disorders of consciousness|volume=367}}

===Anosognosia===
{{main|Anosognosia}}
One of the most striking disorders of consciousness goes by the name [[anosognosia]], a Greek-derived term meaning 'unawareness of disease'.  This is a condition in which patients are disabled in some way, most commonly as a result of a [[stroke]], but either misunderstand the nature of the problem or deny that there is anything wrong with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editors=George Prigatano, [[Daniel Schacter]]|title=Awareness of Deficit After Brain Injury: Clinical and Theoretical Issues |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |chapter=Introduction |authors=George P. Prigatano and [[Daniel Schacter]]|pages=3‚Äì16 |isbn=0-19-505941-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most frequently occurring form is seen in people who have experienced a stroke damaging the [[parietal lobe]] in the right hemisphere of the brain, giving rise to a syndrome known as [[hemispatial neglect]], characterized by an inability to direct action or attention toward objects located to the left with respect to their bodies.  Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the right side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move.  When questioned about the obvious problem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that doesn't make sense.  Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies:  one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in, and when asked what he was doing, complained that somebody had put a dead leg into the bed with him.  An even more striking type of anosognosia is [[Anton‚ÄìBabinski syndrome]], a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editors=George Prigatano, [[Daniel Schacter]]|title=Awareness of Deficit After Brain Injury: Clinical and Theoretical Issues |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |chapter=Anosognosia: possible neuropsychological mechanisms |authors=Kenneth M. Heilman|pages=53‚Äì62 |isbn=0-19-505941-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stream of consciousness==
{{Main|Stream of consciousness (psychology)}}

[[William James]] is usually credited with popularizing the idea that human consciousness flows like a stream, in his ''Principles of Psychology'' of 1890.  According to James, the "stream of thought" is governed by five characteristics:  "(1) Every thought tends to be part of a personal consciousness. (2) Within each personal consciousness thought is always changing. (3) Within each personal consciousness thought is sensibly continuous. (4) It always appears to deal with objects independent of itself. (5) It is interested in some parts of these objects to the exclusion of others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=[[William James]] |title=The Principles of Psychology, Volume 1 |year=1890 |publisher=H. Holt |page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar concept appears in Buddhist philosophy, expressed by the Sanskrit term ''Citta-sa·πÉtƒÅna'', which is usually translated as [[mindstream]] or "mental continuum". Buddhist teachings describe that consciousness manifests moment to moment as sense impressions and mental phenomena that are continuously changing.&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal|author= Karunamuni N.D.|title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind|journal=SAGE Open|volume=5 |issue=2 |date=May 2015 | url= http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf | doi=10.1177/2158244015583860}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teachings list six triggers that can result in the generation of different mental events.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; These triggers are input from the five senses (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or touch sensations), or a thought (relating to the past, present or the future) that happen to arise in the mind. The mental events generated as a result of these triggers are: feelings, perceptions and intentions/behaviour.  The moment-by-moment manifestation of the mind-stream is said to happen in every person all the time. It even happens in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, or analyses the material body including the organ brain.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The manifestation of the mindstream is also described as being influenced by physical laws, biological laws, psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The purpose of the Buddhist practice of [[mindfulness]] is to understand the inherent nature of the consciousness and its characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Losing the Clouds, Gaining the Sky: Buddhism and the Natural Mind |chapter=Taming the mindstream |author=Dzogchen Rinpoche |editor=Doris Wolter |year=2007 |publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn=978-0-86171-359-2 |pages=81‚Äì92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narrative form ===

In the west, the primary impact of the idea has been on literature rather than science:  [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness as a narrative mode]] means writing in a way that attempts to portray the moment-to-moment thoughts and experiences of a character.  This technique perhaps had its beginnings in the monologues of Shakespeare's plays, and reached its fullest development in the novels of [[James Joyce]] and [[Virginia Woolf]], although it has also been used by many other noted writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Robert Humphrey |title=Stream of Consciousness in the Modern Novel |year=1954 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-00585-3 |pages=23‚Äì49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here for example is a passage from Joyce's [[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]] about the thoughts of Molly Bloom:

{{quote|Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the City Arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authors=[[James Joyce]] |title=Ulysses |year=1990 |publisher=BompaCrazy.com |page=620}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Role in quantum mechanics==
Consciousness may have a determinative role in [[quantum mechanics]].  Since consciousness is the primary aspect of an observer, and observation is sometimes viewed as a primary reason for apparent [[wave function collapse]],&lt;ref&gt;Aharonov, Y., Anandan, J., &amp; Vaidman, L. (1993). Meaning of the wave function. Physical Review A, 47(6), 4616.&lt;/ref&gt; consciousness may account for aspects of the  [[measurement problem]] exemplified by the [[Schr√∂dinger's cat]] paradox. This area has been an area of lively debate for decades,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-88026-1_2|chapter = Quantum Mechanics without "The Observer"|title = Quantum Theory and Reality| volume=2| pages=7‚Äì44|series = Studies in the Foundations Methodology and Philosophy of Science|year = 1967|last1 = Popper|first1 = Karl R.| isbn=978-3-642-88028-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; with recent efforts to substitute randomly caused [[decoherence]] as the source of apparent wave function collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = quant-ph/0512078|last1 = Zeh|first1 = H.

[[Max Tegmark]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler]] provided a useful survey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = quant-ph/0101077|last1 = Zeh|first1 = H. D.|title = 100 Years of the Quantum|year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; of some of the issues.

==Spiritual approaches==
{{Further|Level of consciousness (esotericism)|Higher consciousness}}
To most philosophers, the word "consciousness" connotes the relationship between the mind and the world. To writers on spiritual or religious topics, it frequently connotes the relationship between the mind and God, or the relationship between the mind and deeper truths that are thought to be more fundamental than the physical world.  [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Krishna consciousness]], for example, is a term used to mean an intimate linkage between the mind of a worshipper and the god Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lynne Gibson |title=Modern World Religions: Hinduism |publisher=Heinemann Educational Publishers |year=2002 |isbn=0-435-33619-3|pages=2‚Äì4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mystical psychiatrist [[Richard Maurice Bucke]] distinguished between three types of consciousness:  'Simple Consciousness', awareness of the body, possessed by many animals; 'Self Consciousness', awareness of being aware, possessed only by humans; and 'Cosmic Consciousness', awareness of the life and order of the universe, possessed only by humans who are enlightened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=[[Richard Maurice Bucke]]|title=Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind |publisher=Innes &amp; Sons |year=1905 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxRWAAAAMAAJ |pages=1‚Äì2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many more examples could be given, such as the various levels of spiritual consciousness presented by [[Prem Saran Satsangi]] and [[Stuart Hameroff]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Prem Saran Satsangi|Satsangi, Prem Saran]] and [[Stuart Hameroff|Hameroff, Stuart]] (2016) [https://www.amazon.com/Consciousness-Integrating-Eastern-Western-Perspectives/dp/8178224933 ''Consciousness: Integrating Eastern and Western Perspectives''] New Age Books. {{ISBN|978-8178224930}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most thorough account of the spiritual approach may be [[Ken Wilber]]'s book ''The Spectrum of Consciousness'', a comparison of western and eastern ways of thinking about the mind. Wilber described consciousness as a spectrum with ordinary awareness at one end, and more profound types of awareness at higher levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=[[Ken Wilber]] |title=The Spectrum of Consciousness |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |year=2002 |isbn=978-81-208-1848-4|pages=3‚Äì16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cookie Monster''' is a [[The Muppets|Muppet]] on the long-running [[children's television series|children's television show]] ''[[Sesame Street]].'' He is best known for his voracious appetite and his famous eating phrases, such as "Me want cookie!", "Me eat cookie!" (or simply "COOKIE!"), and "Om nom nom nom" (said through a mouth full of food). He eats almost anything, including normally inedible objects. However, as his name suggests, his preferred food is cookies. [[Chocolate chip cookie]]s are his favorite kind. In a song in 2004, Cookie Monster revealed that, before he ate his first cookie, he believed his name was Sid or Sidney.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4432415.stm |title=Cookie Monster curbs cookie habit |date=2005-04-11 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2008-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="first"&gt;{{cite video |date=7 April 2004 |title=Sesame Street - "The First Time Me Eat Cookie" |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ji2z4GqUSd8 |format= |medium= |language= |trans_title= |publisher= |location= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |time=0:30 |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote=Me was just a mild-mannered little kid.

Me don‚Äôt remember me real name‚Ä¶ maybe it was Sidney?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his voracious appetite for cookies, Cookie Monster shows awareness of [[Healthy diet|healthy eating]] habits for young children and also enjoys fruits and [[eggplant]].

He is known to have a mother, a younger sister, and an identically-designed cousin (who ironically does not like cookies), who all share his characteristic [[navy blue]] fur and "[[googly eyes]]." He also has a father, who appeared in a ''[[Monsterpiece Theater]]'' sketch promoting [[energy conservation]], [[water conservation]] and [[environmentalism]]. Both Cookie Monster's mother and father share his enormous appetite and craving for cookies. He and his ''Sesame Street'' friends are popular motifs on T-shirts.

==Origin==

The book ''[[Jim Henson's Designs and Doodles]]'' explains Cookie Monster's origin as follows: "In 1966, Henson drew three monsters that ate cookies and appeared in a [[General Foods]] commercial&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QngRWeEJGo Jim Henson's 1966 test commercial for General Foods Canada snack products Wheels, Flutes and Crowns] on the Jim Henson Company's YouTube official channel.&lt;/ref&gt; that featured three crunchy snack foods: [[Wheels, Flutes and Crowns|Wheels, Crowns and Flutes]]. Each snack was represented by a different monster. The Wheel-Stealer was a short, fuzzy monster with wonky eyes and sharply pointed teeth. The Flute-Snatcher was a speed demon with a long, sharp nose and windblown hair. The Crown-Grabber was a hulk of a monster with a [[Boris Karloff]] accent and teeth that resembled giant knitting needles."{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

"These monsters had insatiable appetites for the snack foods they were named after. Each time the Muppet narrator, a human-looking fellow, fixes himself a tray of Wheels, Flutes and Crowns, they disappear before he can eat them. One by one, the monsters sneak in and zoom away with the snacks. Frustrated and peckish, the narrator warns viewers that these pesky monsters could be disguised as someone in your own home, at which point the monsters briefly turn into people and then dissolve back to monsters again."{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

As it turns out, these commercials were never aired ‚Äî but all three monsters had a future in the Muppet cast. The "Crown-Grabber" was used in a sketch on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', in which he ruins a girl's beautiful day. Known from then on as the [[Beautiful Day Monster]], he made a number of appearances on ''Sesame Street'' and ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. The "Flute-Snatcher" turned into [[The Frackles|Snake Frackle]], a background monster from ''[[The Great Santa Claus Switch]]'' and ''The Muppet Show''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In 1967, Henson used the "Wheel-Stealer" puppet for an [[IBM]] training film called ''[[The Coffee Break Machine|Coffee Break Machine]]''. In the sketch, called "The Computer Dinner", the monster (with frightening eyes and fangs) devours a complex coffee making machine as it describes its different parts. When he is finished, the machine announces the monster has activated the machine's anti-vandalism system, which contains the most powerful explosives known to man. The monster promptly explodes. This sketch was also performed in October, 1967 on ''The Ed Sullivan Show''. It was also later performed on the [[George Burns]] episode of ''The Muppet Show''' using the [[Luncheon Counter Monster]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Two years later, Henson used a similarly-designed and equally ravenous monster for three commercials selling [[Munchos]], a [[Frito-Lay]] potato chip. This time, the puppet was called Arnold, the Munching Monster. After the three ads were produced, Henson had the opportunity to renew the contract. He chose not to, because at that point he was working on ''Sesame Street'' ‚Äî and that monster puppet was moving on to the next stage in his career. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}} According to Frank Oz, in a later routine the then unnamed monster won a quiz show and for winning was "given the choice of $10,000 cash, a new car, a trip to Hawaii, or a cookie." He took the cookie and from then on he was Cookie Monster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=439454321|title=Not My Job: We Quiz Frank Oz On L. Frank Baum, Author Of 'Wizard Of Oz'|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cookie Monster, still unnamed, made his ''Sesame Street'' debut in the first episode, interfering with [[Kermit the Frog]]'s "famous W lecture" by eating a model "W" bit by bit. He turns it into an "N," a "V," and finally an "I," to Kermit's frustration. He then tries to eat Kermit.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

It was during the first season that Cookie Monster got his name and began using the growly vernacular (e.g., "Me eat cookie!") that would become part of his character. His signature song, "[[C Is For Cookie]]", was first aired during the 1971‚Äì72 season, and became one of the best-known songs from ''Sesame Street''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Development==
In 2006, in response to growing concerns about record levels of [[childhood obesity]] in the United States, ''Sesame Street'' began airing segments titled [[Healthy Habits for Life]]. In these segments, the Muppet characters of ''Sesame Street'' talk about healthy habits, such as eating properly and exercising. The ''Healthy Habits for Life'' segments spawned Internet rumors that Cookie Monster's name had been changed to Veggie Monster or would be taken off the show entirely.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;
{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18659731 |title=Cookie Monster: A Sweet, Sensual Id, Unfiltered |first=Elizabeth |last=Blair |date=2008-02-11 |work=[[All Things Considered]]: In Character |publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]] |accessdate=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-04-07-cookie-monster_x.htm |title=Cookie Monster: 'Me eat less cookies' |work=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2005-04-07 |last=Carter |first=Chelsea J |accessdate=2008-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 appearance on [[Martha Stewart]]'s TV program, Cookie Monster explained his new philosophy that "Cookies are a sometimes food."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=November 20, 2007 |url=http://blog.sfgate.com/parenting/2007/11/20/why-is-cookie-monster-eating-carrots/ |title=Why is Cookie Monster eating carrots? |first=Mike |last=Adamick |work=[[SF Gate]] (blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 10, 2008, [[NPR]] host Elizabeth Blair interviewed Cookie Monster for the ''[[All Things Considered]]'' segment ''In Character''. He answered the [[Proust Questionnaire]], as well as revealing some of his favorite and non-favorite things.&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/incharacter/2008/02/cookie_monster_comes_to_npr.html |title=On Air: Cookie Monster |first=Trey |last=Graham |date=2008-02-11 |work=The 'In Character' Blog |publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]] |accessdate=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a June 19, 2008, appearance on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', Cookie Monster again explained that "Cookies are a sometimes food." Colbert had asked agitatedly why Cookie Monster had "abandoned the pro-cookie agenda" and thus caused [[fruit]] to become the favorite snack of American children, according to a study Colbert had heard. Colbert criticized Cookie Monster for not wearing a cookie [[lapel pin]]. Cookie Monster also claimed to have "crazy times during the '70s and '80s," referring to himself as "the [[Robert Downey Jr.#Substance abuse|Robert Downey Jr.]] of cookies." After eating a cookie to prove he still likes cookies, Cookie Monster asked if the Peabody Award, a round medallion on a small pedestal, was a cookie.&lt;ref name="Colbert interview"&gt;{{cite interview|subject=Cookie Monster|interviewer=[[Stephen Colbert (character)|Stephen Colbert]]|title=Cookie Monster|url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/zcd35g/the-colbert-report-cookie-monster|type=Interview: video|work=[[The Colbert Report]]|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=2008-06-19|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Colbert returned to speak to Cookie Monster at the end of the show, the award had disappeared and Cookie Monster was wiping his mouth with a napkin.&lt;ref name="Colbert interview" /&gt;

On November 24, 2010, Cookie Monster started a Facebook page as part of a campaign to host ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2010/11/24/cookie-monster-auditions-for-snl-hosting-gig/ | work=CNN | title=Cookie Monster auditions to be 'SNL' host &amp;ndash; The Marquee Blog | date=2010-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though his bid to host ''Saturday Night Live'' failed, he was allowed to appear with [[Jeff Bridges]] when Jeff hosted the show and sang the Christmas song "[[Silver Bells]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/snl-clip-jeff-bridges-dueting-61580 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | title='SNL' Clip of Jeff Bridges Dueting With Cookie Monster Becomes Viral Video Hit | date=2010-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casting history==

* [[Eric Jacobson]] ‚Äì occasionally since 2001{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

David Rudman officially became Cookie Monster in ''Sesame Street's'' 2002 season (taped 2001), but the year before that, Rudman shared the part with [[Eric Jacobson]], Frank Oz's primary successor. Once Jacobson was cast as Grover and Bert, Sesame Workshop chose Rudman as Cookie Monster to allow for more interaction between Cookie Monster and [[Bert (Sesame Street)|Bert]]/[[Grover]]. Frank Oz still performs Cookie Monster and his other ''Sesame Street'' characters a couple of times per year.

==Merchandise==
Various toys and other icons of the Cookie Monster have been produced over the years. The most obvious is a cookie jar, of which numerous types have been available.

In 1990 U.S. Budget Director [[Richard Darman]] wrote an introduction to the [[United States federal budget|federal budget]] with a section "Green Eyeshades and the Cookie Monster" in which he called Cookie "the quintessential consumer," and the enormous budget "the Ultimate Cookie Monster."{{quote|As all monsters are, Cookie Monster is initially intimidating. His manner is gruff. His clumsiness occasionally causes damage. But quickly, Cookie Monster comes to be seen as benign&amp;mdash;indeed, downright friendly. He has a few bad habits. He cannot resist gobbling up anything and everything that might be consumed, especially cookies. And he cannot quite control the way he spews forth crumbs. He is the quintessential consumer... The budget, for all its intimidating detail, might be seen similarly: as the Ultimate Cookie Monster. ... Its massive presence might be understood as little more than a compilation of cookies received, cookies crumbled, and crumbs spewed forth.

In the [[Food Network]] program ''[[Good Eats]]'' episode "Three Chips for Sister Marsha" (first aired December 13, 2000), a puppet named Maj. Wilfred D. Cookie who looks like a green version of Cookie Monster appears. Asked about his well-known "brother", he responds, "I told you never to mention that ruffian. All he knows about cookies is how to shovel them into his face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goodeatsfanpage.com/Season3/EA1C05.htm |title=EA1C05: Three Chips for Sister Marsha |accessdate=2008-03-29 |work=Good Eats Fan Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] animated series ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Model Misbehavior]]", Cookie Monster is shown in a [[psychiatric hospital]], repeatedly foiling [[Drug rehabilitation|drug rehab]]-styled efforts to cure his cookie addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= Model Misbehavior |episodelink=Model Misbehavior |series=Family Guy |serieslink=Family Guy |network=Fox Broadcasting Company |airdate=24 July 2005 |season=4 |number=10}} &amp;ndash; Cookie Monster hides a plate of cookies under his sheets.

===Music===
[[John Lennon]]'s song "[[Hold On (John Lennon song)|Hold On]]," recorded in 1970 (only a year after ''Sesame Street'' debuted), features Lennon shouting "Cookie!" in Cookie Monster's voice, in the middle of the instrumental break in an otherwise calm, quiet song.

The [[Death growl|guttural singing style]] in [[death metal]] bands is commonly (if facetiously) compared to Cookie Monster's low-pitched, gravelly voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fusilli |first=Jim |url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110007902 |title=That's Good Enough for Me |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=February 1, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103110228/http://opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110007902|archivedate=January 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kaja Bordevich Ballo''' (1988&amp;nbsp;‚Äì March 28, 2008) was a [[university student]] in the [[France|French]] town of Nice; her father was [[Olav Gunnar Ballo]], a member of the [[Stortinget|Norwegian Parliament]]. On March 28, 2008 Kaja Ballo took the [[Oxford Capacity Analysis|personality test]] run by the [[Church of Scientology]], and committed [[suicide]] later the same day. Family and friends stated that Ballo was happy prior to taking the test, and that her mood dramatically shifted after receiving the results. She committed suicide hours after getting the results of the test back; Ballo jumped from the fourth floor of her dorm room. In addition to a note, her family found the Scientology personality test among her belongings. [[French police]] investigated connections between Scientology and Ballo's death, and interviewed two leaders of the organization in France. Prosecutors stated in December 2008 that they were unable to establish a causative link between the Scientology test and Ballo's death.

A Scientology representative in France asserted that the Scientology personality test was not created by the Church of Scientology, and that it was not related to Ballo's death. The Church of Scientology's information chief in Norway, Matthias Fosse stated that the test was not dangerous and that the organization did not bear any responsibility for Ballo's death. Ballo's father retained a lawyer to investigate his daughter's death, and the family considered filing a lawsuit against Scientology. 500 people attended Ballo's funeral on April 11, 2008 at [[Grefsen Church]] in [[Oslo]], Norway.

The incident received significant media coverage in Norway, and ''[[Verdens Gang]]'' and ''[[Dagbladet]]'' devoted multiple [[Article (publishing)|cover stories]] to investigating the controversy. The media faced criticism for its extensive coverage of Ballo's death.&lt;ref name="kritikk"/&gt; Norway parliament member [[Inga Marte Thorkildsen]] commented that she thought indications were that Scientology had a role in Ballo's suicide. [[Psychologist]] Rudy Myrvang told ''[[Aftenposten]]'' that the Scientology personality test was designed to break down an individual; he characterized the test as a form of recruitment tool for the organization. Scientology critic [[Andreas Heldal-Lund]] stated parents of those involved in Scientology contacted him with similar concerns. The Norwegian Psychological Association warned individuals against taking such types of personality tests.

Ballo's father wrote a book about his daughter's death, and refrained from interviews with the press until the book was published in 2009. Titled '''''Kaja: 1988‚Äì2008''''', the book became a [[bestseller]] in Norway. It reached second place on the bestseller list of the Bestseller Association in Norway for general literature, in May 2009. The author stated he wrote the book as an expository method to both process his grief, inform his family about the controversy, and educate the public about suicide.

Norway parliament member [[Inga Marte Thorkildsen]] weighed in on the situation, and stated to the [[Oslo]], Norway newspaper ''Dagbladet'', "All indications are that the Scientologist sect has played a direct role in Kaja's choice to take her own life."&lt;ref name="berglund" /&gt; Ballo's friend and study partner Henry M√∏inichen told ''Dagbladet'', "I think Kaja would be alive today if she had not gone to the Scientologists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Gjerstad | first =Tore | title = Ville v√¶rt i live i dag hvis hun ikke hadde g√•tt til scientologene | work =Dagbladet | publisher = www.dagbladet.no | date =April 15, 2008 | url = http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2008/04/15/532571.html | accessdate = 2010-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychologist]] Rudy Myrvang told ''Aftenposten'' that testing procedures such as the personality test conducted by Scientology could have negative consequences; he said the goal was focused on "breaking you down, and then they'll offer to build you up again".&lt;ref name="berglund" /&gt; Myrvang characterized the Scientology personality test as a recruitment tactic for the organization.&lt;ref name="berglund" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Den eneste positive egenskapen jeg hadde var at jeg var god p√• kommunikasjon | work = Dagbladet | language = Norwegian | publisher = www.dagbladet.no | date = April 15, 2008 | url = http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2008/04/15/532596.html | accessdate =2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dagbladet'' consulted an expert on the subject of assessment tests, Ole I.

Scientology critic [[Andreas Heldal-Lund]] stated that the Church of Scientology views candidates for the test as "raw meat from the street".&lt;ref name="berglund" /&gt; "You're told you're worth nothing," he said.&lt;ref name="berglund" /&gt; Heldal-Lund stated that, "thousands of desperate parents contact me because they have children who have had major mental problems, or taken their own life after similar circumstances to Kaja Ballo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Lillebo | first = Maria R√∏bech | title = Ikke la deg lure | work =P4 Radio Hele Norge ASA | language = Norwegian| publisher = www.p4.no | date =April 15, 2008 | url =http://www.p4.no/story.aspx?id=268915 | accessdate = 2010-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology-associated celebrity, [[Hank Von Helvete]], commented to the press that he thought psychiatry, not Scientology, was the cause of Ballo's suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Thorkildsen | first =Joakim | title =Trygve (31) er Hanks scientolog-manager | work =Dagbladet | publisher =www.dagbladet.no | date =June 13, 2009 | url =http://www.dagbladet.no/labrador/articles/668/668947/6689478/6689478/6689478.php5 | accessdate =2010-05-28 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20120525032042/http://www.dagbladet.no/labrador/articles/668/668947/6689478/6689478/6689478.php5# | archive-date =2012-05-25 | dead-url =yes | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[TV 2 (Norway)|TV 2]]'' reported that psychologists advised that subsequent to the personality test, there should be proper follow-up attention with the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Du kan bl√•se av deg hodet.

'''Desmond Mpilo Tutu''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order for Meritorious Service|OMSG]] [[Order of the Companions of Honour|CH]] [[GCStJ]]}} (born 7 October 1931) is a South African [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] cleric and [[theologian]] known for his work as an [[anti-apartheid movement|anti-apartheid]] and [[human rights]] activist. He was the [[Anglican Diocese of Johannesburg|Bishop of Johannesburg]] from 1985 to 1986 and then the [[Archbishop of Cape Town]] from 1986 to 1996, in both cases being the first indigenous black African to hold the position. Theologically, he sought to fuse ideas from [[black theology]] with [[African theology]]; politically, he identifies as a [[socialist]].

Tutu was born of mixed [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and [[Tswana people|Motswana]] heritage to a poor family in [[Klerksdorp]], [[Union of South Africa|British Imperial South Africa]]. Entering adulthood, he trained as a teacher and married [[Nomalizo Leah Tutu]], with whom he had several children. In 1960, he was ordained as an Anglican priest and in 1962 moved to the United Kingdom to study theology at [[King's College London]]. In 1966 he returned to southern Africa, teaching at the [[Federal Theological Seminary of Southern Africa|Federal Theological Seminary]] and then the [[University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland]]. In 1972, he became the Theological Education Fund's director for Africa, a position based in [[London]] but necessitating regular tours of the African continent. Back in southern Africa in 1975, he served first as [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] of [[St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg|St Mary's Cathedral]] in [[Johannesburg]] and then as [[Bishop of Lesotho]], taking an active role in opposition to South Africa's [[apartheid]] system of [[racial segregation]] and [[White South African|white-minority]] rule. From 1978 to 1985 he was general-secretary of the [[South African Council of Churches]], emerging as one of South Africa's most prominent anti-apartheid activists. Although warning the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government that apartheid would lead to racial violence, as an activist he stressed [[non-violent protest]] and foreign economic pressure to bring about change.

In 1985 he became Bishop of Johannesburg and in 1986 the Archbishop of Cape Town, the most senior position in southern Africa's Anglican hierarchy. In this position he emphasised a consensus-building model of leadership and oversaw the [[Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion|introduction of women priests]]. Also in 1986, he became president of the [[All Africa Conference of Churches]], resulting in further tours of the continent. After President [[F. W. de Klerk]] released the anti-apartheid activist [[Nelson Mandela]] from prison in 1990 and the pair led negotiations to dissolve apartheid, Tutu assisted as a mediator between rival black factions. After the [[South African general election, 1994|1994 general election]] resulted in a [[Government of National Unity (South Africa)|coalition government]] headed by Mandela, the latter selected Tutu to chair the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] to investigate past human rights abuses committed by both pro and anti-apartheid groups. Since apartheid's fall, Tutu has campaigned for [[gay rights]] and spoken out on a wide range of subjects, among them the [[Israel-Palestine conflict]], his opposition to the [[Iraq War]], and his criticism of South African Presidents [[Thabo Mbeki]] and [[Jacob Zuma]]. In 2010, he retired from public life.

Tutu polarised opinion as he rose to notability in the 1970s. White conservatives who supported apartheid despised him, while many white [[liberalism|liberals]] regarded him as too radical; many black radicals accused him of being too moderate and focused on cultivating white goodwill, while [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninists]] criticised his [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] stance. He was widely popular among South Africa's black majority, and was internationally praised for his anti-apartheid activism, receiving a range of awards, including the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. He has also compiled several books of his speeches and sermons.

==Early life==

In 1936, the family moved to [[Tshing]], where Zachariah was employed as the principal of a Methodist school; they lived in a hut in the school yard.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=20}} There, Tutu started his primary education and played football with the other children,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=21}} also becoming the server at St Francis Anglican Church.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=33}} He developed a love of reading, particularly enjoying comic books and European [[fairy tales]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=30|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=4|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=21}} Here, he also learned [[Afrikaans]], the main language of the area.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=23|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=4|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=21}} It was in Tshing that his parents had a third son, Tamsanqa, who also died in infancy.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=21}} Around 1941, Tutu's mother moved to [[Witwatersrand]] to work as a cook at Ezenzeleni, an institute for the blind in western Johannesburg. Tutu joined her in the city, first living with an aunt in [[Roodepoort|Roodepoort West]] before they secured their own house in the township.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=5|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=24}} In Johannesburg, he attended a Methodist primary school before transferring to the [[Swedish Boarding School]] (SBS) in the [[St. Martin's School (Rosettenville)|St Agnes Mission]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=24}} Several months later, he moved with his father to [[Ermelo]], eastern Transvaal.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=25}} After six months, the duo returned to live with the rest of the family in Roodepoort West, where Tutu resuming his studies at SBS.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=25}} He had pursued his interest in [[Christianity]] and at the age of 12 underwent [[confirmation]] at St Mary's Church, Roodepoort.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=34}}

Tutu failed the arithmetic component of his primary school exam, but despite this, his father secured him entry to the Johannesburg Bantu High School in 1945, where he excelled academically.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=25, 34‚Äì35}} There, he joined a school [[rugby union|rugby]] team, developing a lifelong love of the sport.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=36}} Outside of school, he earned money selling oranges and as a [[caddie]] for white [[Golf|golfers]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=27|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=7|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=37}} To avoid the expense of a daily train commute to school, he briefly lived with family nearer to Johannesburg, before moving back in with his parents when they relocated to [[Munsieville]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=36, 37‚Äì38}} He then returned to Johannesburg by moving into a hostel that was part of the Anglican complex surrounding the Church of Christ the King in [[Sophiatown]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=29|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=8|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=42}} He became a server at the church and came under the influence of its priest, [[Trevor Huddleston]];{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=10|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=43‚Äì45}} later biographer [[Shirley du Boulay]] suggested that Huddleston was "the greatest single influence" in Tutu's life.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=31}} In 1947, Tutu contracted [[tuberculosis]] and was hospitalised in [[Rietfontein]] for 18 months, during which he spent much of his time reading and was regularly visited by Huddleston.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=29‚Äì30|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=9|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=45‚Äì46}} In the hospital, he underwent a [[circumcision]] to mark his transition to manhood.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=47}} He returned to school in 1949 and took his national exams in late 1950, gaining a second-class pass.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=47‚Äì48}}

===College and teaching career: 1951‚Äì1955===

Wanting to become a doctor, Tutu secured admission to study medicine at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]]; however, his parents could not afford the tuition fees.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=47‚Äì48}} Instead, he turned toward teaching, gaining a government scholarship to start a course at Pretoria Bantu Normal College, a teacher training institution, in 1951.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=12|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=48}} There, he served as treasurer of the Student Representative Council, helped to organise the Literacy and Dramatic Society, and chaired the Cultural and Debating Society for two years.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=48}} It was during one local debating event that he first met the lawyer‚Äîand future president of South Africa‚Äî[[Nelson Mandela]]; the latter did not remember the meeting and they would not encounter each other again until 1990.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=17|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=48‚Äì49}} At the college, Tutu attained his Transvaal Bantu Teachers Diploma, having gained advice about taking exams from the activist [[Robert Sobukwe]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=37|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=18|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=50}} He had also taken five correspondence courses provided by the [[University of South Africa]] (UNISA), graduating in the same class as future Zimbabwean leader [[Robert Mugabe]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=37|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=18|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=49‚Äì50}}

In 1954, he began teaching English at Madibane High School; the following year, he transferred to the [[Krugersdorp High School]], where he taught English and history.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=37|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=17, 18|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=50‚Äì51}} He began courting Nomalizo Leah Shenxane, a friend of his sister Gloria who was studying to become a primary school teacher.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=18|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=51}} They were legally married at Krugersdorp Native Commissioner's Court in June 1955, before undergoing a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] wedding ceremony at the Church of Mary Queen of Apostles; although he was an Anglican, Tutu had agreed to the ceremony due to Leah's Roman Catholic faith.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=38|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=51‚Äì52}} The newly married couple initially lived in a room at Tutu's parental home before renting their own home six months later.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=52}} Their first child, Trevor, was born in April 1956;{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=22|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=53}} their first daughter, Thandeka, appeared 16 months later.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=53}} The couple worshipped at St Paul's Church, where Tutu volunteered as a [[Sunday school]] teacher, assistant choirmaster, church councillor, lay preacher, and sub-deacon,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=53}} while outside of the church he also volunteered as a football administrator for a local team.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=52}}

[[File:St Albans, Golders Green-2.jpg|thumb|right|Tutu first ministered to a white congregation at the Church of St Alban the Martyr in Golder's Green, living with his family in the curate's flat]]

In 1953, the white-minority [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government had introduced the [[Bantu Education Act, 1953|Bantu Education Act]] as a means of furthering their [[apartheid]] system of racial segregation and white domination; both Tutu and his wife disliked these reforms and decided to leave the teaching profession.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=41‚Äì45|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=20‚Äì21|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=60‚Äì61}} With Huddleston's support, Tutu left the teaching profession to become an Anglican priest.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=23|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=61}} In January 1956, his request to join the [[Ordinands Guild]] was turned down due to the debts he had accrued; these were then paid off by the wealthy industrialist and philanthropist [[Harry Oppenheimer]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=61‚Äì62}} Tutu was admitted to [[St. Martin's School (Rosettenville)|St Peter's Theological College]] in [[Rosettenville, Gauteng|Rosettenville]], Johannesburg, which was run by the Anglican [[Community of the Resurrection]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=46|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=25|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=63‚Äì64}} The college was residential, and Tutu lived there while his wife moved to train as a nurse in [[Sekhukhuneland]] and his children lived with his parents in Munsieville.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=26|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=64}} In August 1960, his wife gave birth to another daughter, Naomi.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=68}}

At the college, Tutu studied the Bible, Anglican doctrine, church history, and Christian ethics,{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=47|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=64‚Äì65}} earning a [[Licentiate of Theology]] degree.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=47}} The college's principal, [[Godfrey Pawson]], wrote that Tutu "has exceptional knowledge and intelligence and is very industrious. At the same time he shows no arrogance, mixes in well and is popular... He has obvious gifts of leadership."{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=67}} He won the archbishop's annual essay prize for his discussion of Christianity and [[Islam]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=62‚Äì63|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=35|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=72}} During his years at the college, there had been an intensification in anti-apartheid activism in South Africa, accompanied by a growing government crackdown on this dissent; in March 1960 several hundred casualties resulted from the [[Sharpeville massacre]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=26|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=68‚Äì69}} Tutu and his other trainees did not mobilise in support of the anti-apartheid movement;{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=49|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=70}} he later noted that "we were in some ways a very apolitical bunch".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=70}}

[[File:Bletchingley Church in September 2010.jpg|thumb|left|During his master's degree, Tutu worked as assistant curate at St Mary's Church in Bletchingley, Surrey]]

In December 1960, [[Edward Paget (bishop)|Edward Paget]] ordained Tutu as an Anglican minister at [[St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg|St Mary's Cathedral]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=54|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=28|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=74}} Tutu was then appointed assistant curate in St Alban's Parish, [[Benoni, Gauteng|Benoni]], where he was reunited with his wife and children; they lived in a converted garage.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=54‚Äì55|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=28|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=74}} He earned 72.50 rand a month, which was two-thirds of what his white counterparts were given.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=75}} In 1962, Tutu was transferred to St Philip's Church in [[Thokoza]], where he was placed in charge of the congregation and developed a passion for pastoral ministry.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=55|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=28|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=76}} Many in South Africa's white-dominated Anglican establishment felt the need for a greater number of indigenous Africans in positions of ecclesiastical authority; to assist in this, [[Aelfred Stubbs]] proposed that Tutu be trained as a theology teacher at [[King's College London]] (KCL) in Britain.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=57|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=31|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=77}} Funding was secured from the [[International Missionary Council]]'s Theological Education Fund (TEF),{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=81}} and the government agreed to give the Tutus permission to move to Britain.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=31|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=79‚Äì81}} They duly did so in September 1962.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=57}} 

At KCL's theology department, Tutu studied under theologians like [[Dennis Nineham]], [[Christopher Evans (theologian)|Christopher Evans]], [[Sydney Evans (priest)|Sydney Evans]], [[Geoffrey Parrinden]], and [[Eric Mascall]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=86}} In London, the Tutus felt liberated experiencing a life free from apartheid and the [[pass laws]] of South Africa;{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=58|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=32|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=87}} he later noted that "there is racism in England, but we were not exposed to it".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=87}} He was also impressed by the [[freedom of speech]] available in the country, especially that at [[Speakers' Corner]].{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=59}} The family moved into the curate's flat behind the Church of St Alban the Martyr in [[Golders Green]]; they were allowed to live rent-free on the condition that Tutu assisted Sunday services, the first time that he had ministered to a white congregation.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=57‚Äì58, 63|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=31, 33|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=84, 87}} It was in the flat that a daughter, Mpho Andrea, was born in 1963.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=34|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=88}} Tutu was academically successful and his tutors suggested that he convert to an [[honours degree]], which entailed him also studying Hebrew.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=89‚Äì90}} He received his degree from [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] in a ceremony held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=61}}

Nearing the end of his bachelor of arts studies, he decided to continue on to a master's degree, securing a TEF grant to fund it;{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=61‚Äì62|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=92}} he studied for this degree from October 1965 until September 1966, completing his dissertation on Islam in West Africa.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=35|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=92, 95}} During this period, the family moved from Golders Green to [[Bletchingley]] in [[Surrey]], where Tutu worked as the assistant curate of St Mary's Church.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=63|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=35|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=93}} In the village, he encouraged cooperation between his Anglican parishioners and the local Roman Catholic and Methodist communities.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=35}} Tutu's time in London helped him to jettison any bitterness to whites and feelings of racial inferiority; he overcame his habit of automatically deferring to whites.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=34}}

===Teaching in South Africa and Lesotho: 1966‚Äì1972===

In 1966, the Tutus left the UK and travelled, via [[Paris]] and [[Rome]], to [[East Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=98‚Äì99}} Spending two months in the city, Tutu studied Arabic and Greek at [[St. George's College, Jerusalem|St George's College]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=39|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=98‚Äì99}} He was shocked at the level of tension between the city's Jewish and Arab citizens.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=39}} From there, the family returned to South Africa, spending Christmas with family in Witwatersrand.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=101}} They found it difficult readjusting to a society where they were impacted by segregation and pass laws.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=69|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=101}} He explored the possibility on conducting a PhD at UNISA, on the subject of [[Moses in Islam|Moses]] in the [[Quran]], but this project never materialised.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=73‚Äì74|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=42|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=95}} In 1967 they proceeded to [[Alice, Eastern Cape]], where the [[Federal Theological Seminary of Southern Africa|Federal Theological Seminary]] (Fedsem) had recently been established, an amalgamation of training institutions from different Christian denominations.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=69|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=41|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=101, 103}} There, Tutu was employed teaching doctrine, the Old Testament, and Greek.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=73|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=104}} Tutu was the college's first black staff-member, with most of the others being European or American expatriates.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=104, 105}} The campus allowed a level of racial-mixing which was absent in most of South African society.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=71‚Äì72|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=105}} Leah also gained employment there, as a library assistant.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=105}} They sent their children to a private boarding school in Swaziland, thereby ensuring that they were not instructed under the government's Bantu Education syllabus.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=42|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=101}}

While at St Peter's, Tutu had also joined a pan-Protestant group, the [[Church Unity Commission]], and served as a delegate at Anglican-Catholic conversations in southern Africa.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=116}} It was also at this point that he began publishing in [[academic journals]] and journals of current affairs.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=116}}
Tutu was also appointed as the Anglican chaplain to the neighbouring [[University of Fort Hare]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=42|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=108}} In an unusual move for the time, he invited female students to become servers during the Eucharist alongside their male counterparts.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=108}} He joined Anglican student delegations to meetings of the [[Anglican Students' Federation]] and the [[University Christian Movement]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=109}} It was from this environment that the [[Black Consciousness Movement]] emerged under the leadership of figures like [[Steve Biko]] and [[Barney Pityana]]; although not averse to working with other racial groups to fight apartheid, as the exponents of Black Consciousness often were, Tutu was supportive of the movement's efforts.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=75‚Äì77|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=43‚Äì44|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=109‚Äì110}} In August 1968, he gave a sermon comparing the situation in South Africa with that in the [[Eastern Bloc]], likening anti-apartheid protests to the recent [[Prague Spring]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=78|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=44|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=110}} In September, Fort Hare students held a sit-in protest at the university administration's policies; after they were surrounded by police with [[police dogs|dogs]], Tutu waded into the crowd to pray with the protesters.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=78‚Äì79|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=44|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=111}} This was the first time that he had witnessed state power used to suppress dissent, and he cried during public prayers the next day.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=79|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=45|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=112}}

Although plans were afoot for Tutu to become Vice Principal of Fedsem, he decided to leave the seminary to accept a teaching post at the [[University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland]] (UBLS) in [[Roma, Lesotho]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=80|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=45|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=113}} The new position allowed him to live closer to his children and offered twice the salary he earned at Fedsem.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=81|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=45|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=113}} In January 1970, he and his wife moved to the UBLS campus; most of his fellow staff members were white expatriates from the U.S. or Britain although the university's policy was non-racial and inclusive.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=114‚Äì115}} As well as his teaching position, he also became the college's Anglican chaplain and the warden of two student residences.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=115}} In Lesotho, he joined the executive board of the [[Lesotho Ecumenical Association]] and served as an [[external examiner]] for both Fedsem and [[Rhodes University]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=116}} He returned to South Africa on several occasions, including to visit his father shortly before the latter's death in February 1971.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=116}}

===Africa Director for the TEF: 1972‚Äì1975===

{{Quote box
| quote = Black theology seeks to make sense of the life experience of the black man, which is largely black suffering at the hands of rampant white racism, and to understand this in the light of what God has said about himself, about man, and about the world in his very definite Word... Black theology has to do with whether it is possible to be black and continue to be Christian; it is to ask on whose side is God; it is to be concerned about the humanisation of man, because those who ravage our humanity dehumanise themselves in the process; [it says] that the liberation of the black man is the other side of the liberation of the white man‚Äîso it is concerned with human liberation.

The TEF offered Tutu a job as their director for Africa, a position that would require relocating to London. Tutu agreed, although was initially refused permission to leave by the South African authorities; they regarded him with suspicion ever since his involvement in the Fort Hare student protests and were also increasingly antagonistic toward the WCC, which ran the TEF, bceause it had condemned apartheid as un-Christian. After Tutu insisted that taking the position would be good publicity for South Africa, the authorities relented.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=88|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=49, 51|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=119‚Äì120}} In March 1972, he returned to Britain. The TEF's headquarters were in [[Bromley]], a town in the southeast of the city, with the Tutu family settling in nearby [[Grove Park, Lewisham|Grove Park]], where Tutu became honorary curate of St Augustine's Church.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=88, 92|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=51‚Äì53|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=123, 143‚Äì144}}

Tutu's job entailed assessing grants to theological training institutions and students.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=53|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=123}} This required him touring much of Africa in the early 1970s, and he wrote accounts of his experiences.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=53|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=124}} In [[Zaire]], he for instance lamented the widespread corruption and poverty, while complaining that [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]'s "military regime... is extremely galling to a black from South Africa".{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=125‚Äì127}} In Nigeria, he first witnessed the interaction between Christians and Muslims in real life, and expressed concern at the [[Igbo people]]'s resentment following the crushing of their [[Biafra|Republic of Biafra]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=128}} In 1972 he travelled around East Africa, where he was impressed by [[Jomo Kenyatta]]'s Kenyan government and witnessed [[Idi Amin]]'s expulsion of Ugandan Asians.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=129‚Äì130}} Back in England, he experienced one of his only racist encounters in the country when a stranger told him "You bastard, get back to Uganda", mistaking him for a Ugandan Asian refugee.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=52}} He also acknowledged that he retained his own subconscious anti-black racist thoughts; when on a Nigerian plane, he felt a "nagging worry" on discovering that both pilot and co-pilot were black, having been conditioned to thinking that only whites could be entrusted with such positions of responsibility.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=54}}

During the early 1970s, Tutu's theology fundamentally changed as a result both of his experiences in Africa and his discovery of [[liberation theology]], a term coined in 1971 by the Peruvian priest [[Gustavo Guti√©rrez]] and introduced to Tutu by the TEF's associate director for Latin America, [[Aharon Sapsezian]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=135}} On discovering [[black theology]], he had been immediately attracted to it,{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=85|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=46}} in 1973 attending a conference on the subject at [[New York City]]'s [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=137}} There, he presented a paper in which he stated that "black theology is an engaged not an academic, detached theology. It is a gut level theology, relating to the real concerns, the life and death issues of the black man."{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=138}} He stated that his paper was not an attempt to demonstrate the academic respectability of black theology but rather to make "a straightforward, perhaps shrill, statement about an existent. Black theology is. No permission is being requested for it to come into being... Frankly the time has passed when we will wait for the white man to give us permission to do our thing. Whether or not he accepts the intellectual respectability of our activity is largely irrelevant. We will proceed regardless."{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=139}} Tutu sought to fuse the African-American derived black theology with [[African theology]], an approach which contrasted with that of other African theologians like [[John Mbiti]] who regarded black theology as a foreign import not relevant to the African situation.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=137}}

===Dean of Johannesburg and Bishop of Lesotho: 1975‚Äì1978===

In 1975, Tutu was nominated to be the new [[Anglican Diocese of Johannesburg|Bishop of Johannesburg]], although lost out to [[Timothy Bavin]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=94|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=54}} Bavin suggested that Tutu take his newly vacated position, that of the [[Dean (religion)|dean]] of St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg. Tutu was elected to this position‚Äîthe fourth highest in South Africa's Anglican hierarchy‚Äîin March 1975, becoming the first black man to do so, an appointment making headline news in South Africa.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=94‚Äì96|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=55, 58|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=139, 144‚Äì145}} Tutu decided to return to South Africa, a decision opposed by Leah, resulting in a strain on their marriage.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=144}} Tutu was officially installed as dean in an August 1975 ceremony. The cathedral was packed for the event; in attendance was the TEF's chairman, Archibishop [[Karekin Sarkissian]] of the [[Armenian Orthodox Church]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=145‚Äì146}} Moving to the city, Tutu lived not in the official dean's residence in the white suburb of [[Houghton Estate|Houghton]] but rather in [[Tutu House|a house]] on a middle-class street in the [[Orlando West]] township of [[Soweto]], a largely impoverished area for blacks.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=96‚Äì97|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=58|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=146}} The cathedral's congregation was racially mixed but with a white majority; this mixing gave Tutu hope that a racially equal, de-segregated future was possible for South Africa.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=59‚Äì60|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=147}} He attempted to modernise the liturgies used by the cathedral's congregation although found that this was not desired by most.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=98|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=60|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=149}} He also divided opinion among the congregation for his support of the ordination of women and for replacing masculine pronouns with gender neutral ones in his sermons and liturgy.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=98‚Äì99|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=60}}

[[File:Lesotho mountain village (5285775857).jpg|thumb|left|As Bishop of Lesotho, Tutu travelled around the country's mountains visiting the people living there]]

Tutu used his position to speak out about what he regarded as social injustice.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=60}} He met with Black Consciousness Movement figures like [[Mamphela Ramphele]] and Soweto community leaders like [[Nthano Motlana]],{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=102‚Äì103|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=61}} and publicly endorsed international [[Disinvestment from South Africa|economic boycott of South Africa]] over its apartheid policy.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=155}} He opposed the government's [[Terrorism Act, 1967]] and shared a platform with anti-apartheid campaigner [[Winnie Mandela]] in condemning it.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=150}} He held a 24-hour vigil for racial harmony at the cathedral where he included special prayers for those activists detained under the act.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=150‚Äì151}} In May 1976, he wrote a letter to Prime Minister [[B.

Over the course of ten months, at least 660 were killed, the majority of them under the age of 24.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=106|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=62‚Äì64|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=154, 156‚Äì158}} Tutu was upset by what he regarded as the lack of outrage from South Africa's white community; he raised the issue in his Sunday sermon, stating that the white silence was "deafening" and asking if they would have shown the same nonchalance had the school children killed by police and pro-government paramilitaries been white.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=107|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=64|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=158}}

Tutu had been scheduled to serve a seven-year term as dean, however after seven months he was nominated as a candidate in an election for the position of [[Bishop of Lesotho]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=65|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=149}} Although Tutu stipulated that he did not want the position, he was elected to the position regardless in March 1976, at which he reluctantly accepted it.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=65|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=151}} This decision upset some of his congregation, who felt that he had used their parish as a stepping stone for his personal career advancement.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=65}} In July, [[Bill Burnett]] consecrated Tutu as a bishop at St Mary's Cathedral.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=109|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=65|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=159}} In August, Tutu was enthroned as the Bishop of Lesotho in a ceremony at [[Maseru]]'s [[Cathedral of St Mary and St James]]; thousands attended, including King [[Moshoeshoe II]] and Prime Minister [[Leabua Jonathan]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=109|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=65|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=159}} In this position, he travelled around the diocese, often visiting parishes in the mountains.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=111|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=160‚Äì161}} He learned the [[Sesotho]] language and developed a deep affection for the country.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=161}} He appointed [[Philip Mokuku]] as the first dean of the diocese and placed great emphasis on [[further education]] for the Basotho clergy.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=160}} He befriended the royal family although his relationship with Jonathan's right-wing government, of which he disapproved, was strained.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=66‚Äì67|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=162}} In September 1977 he returned to South Africa after being invited to speak at the [[Eastern Cape]] funeral of Black Consciousness activist Steve Biko, who had been killed by police while in their custody.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=117‚Äì118|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=67|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=163}} At the funeral, Tutu stated that Black Consciousness was "a movement by which God, through Steve, sought to awaken in the black person a sense of his intrinsic value and worth as a child of God".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=164}}

After John Rees stepped down as general secretary of the [[South African Council of Churches]], Tutu was among the nominees for his successor. John Thorne was ultimately elected to the position, although stepped down from the position after three months. Tutu was nominated once more, this time being selected. Tutu was unsure whether to accept, but agreed to do so at the urging of the synod of bishops.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=120|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=69|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=164‚Äì165}} His decision angered many Anglicans in Lesotho, who felt that Tutu was abandoning them.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=121|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=69}} Tutu took charge of the SACC in March 1978.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=130|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=72|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=167}} Returning to Johannesburg‚Äîwhere the SACC's headquarters were based at [[Khotso House]]{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=74|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=170}}‚Äîthe Tutus returned to their former Orlando West home, now bought for them by an anonymous foreign donor.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=169‚Äì170}} Leah gained employment as the assistant director of the [[Institute of Race Relations]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=170}}

Tutu was the SACC's first black leader,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=72}} and at the time, the SACC was one of the only Christian institutions in South Africa where black people had the majority representation.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=168}} There, he introduced a schedule of daily staff prayers, regular Bible study, monthly Eucharist, and silent retreats.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=169}} He also developed a new style of leadership, appointing senior staff who were capable of taking the initiative, delegating much of the SACC's detailed work to them, and keeping in touch with them through meetings and memorandums.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=171}} Many of his staff referred to him as "Baba" (father).{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=73}} He was determined that the SACC become one of South Africa's most visible [[human rights]] advocacy organisations, a course which would anger the government.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=72}} His efforts gained him international recognition; in 1978 Kings College London elected him a fellow while the [[University of Kent]] and General Theological Seminary gave him honorary doctorates; the following year [[Harvard University]] also gave him an honorary doctorate.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=169|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=89‚Äì90}}

As head of the SACC, Tutu's time was dominated by fundraising efforts, particularly attempts to secure funds from overseas to pay for the organisation's various projects.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=154|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=73}} While Tutu was in charge of the SACC, it was revealed that one of its divisional director's had been stealing funds. In November 1981 an all-white government commission was launched to investigate the issue, headed by the judge C. F. Eloff.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=172‚Äì177|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=82|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=192‚Äì197}} Tutu gave evidence to the commission, during which he criticised apartheid as "evil" and "unchristian".{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=83‚Äì84|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=197‚Äì199}} When the Eloff report was published, Tutu criticised it, focusing particularly on the absence of any theologians on its board, likening it to "a group of blind men" judging the [[Chelsea Flower Show]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=178|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=197‚Äì199}} Tutu also missed pastoral work, and in 1981 also became the rector of St Augustine's Church in Soweto's [[Orlando West]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=135|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=75|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=215}} He also began collecting some of his sermons and speeches, publishing them in a collection titled ''Crying in the Wilderness: The Struggle for Justice in South Africa'' in 1982.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=144}} This was followed by another collected volume, ''Hope and Suffering'', in 1984.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=144}}

====Activism and the Nobel Peace Prize====

During this period, he testified on behalf of a captured cell of the [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]], an armed anti-apartheid group linked to the banned [[African National Congress]] (ANC). He stated that although he was committed to non-violence and censured those on all sides who used violence, he could understand why other black Africans would turn towards it when all their non-violent tactics had proved fruitless in overturning apartheid.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=172}} In an earlier address, he had expressed the view that an armed struggle against the South African government had little chance of succeeding but also called out Western nations for hypocrisy, noting that they were condemning armed liberation groups in southern Africa while they had praised armed liberation groups operating in Europe during the [[Second World War]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=162‚Äì163}}

In January 1981, the government returned Tutu's passport to him.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=90|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=189}} In March, he embarked on a five-week visit to ten countries in Europe and North America, meeting politicians including the UN Secretary General [[Kurt Waldheim]], and addressing the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1761|UN Special Committee Against Apartheid]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=189‚Äì190|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=90‚Äì91|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=189}} In the UK, he met Runcie gave a sermon in [[Westminster Abbey]], while in [[Rome]] he spent a few minutes with Pope [[John Paul II]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=190|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=91|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=190}} On his return to South Africa, Botha again ordered his passport confiscated, preventing Tutu from personally collecting several further honorary degrees.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=91|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=190‚Äì191}} It was returned to him 17 months later.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=91}} In September 1982 he addressed the Triennial Convention of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in [[New Orleans]] before traveling to [[Kentucky]] to see his daughter Naomi, who lived there with her American husband.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=191|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=91‚Äì92}} He was troubled that President [[Ronald Reagan]] adopted a warmer relationship with the South African government than his predecessor [[Jimmy Carter]], relating that Reagan's government was "an unmitigated disaster for us blacks".{{sfn|Gish|2004|pp=92‚Äì93, 95}} Tutu gained a popular following in the US, where he was often compared to civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], although white [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] like [[Patrick Buchanan]] and [[Jerry Falwell]] lambasted him as an alleged communist sympathiser.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=196, 198|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=93‚Äì94}}

By the 1980s, Tutu had become an icon for many black South Africans, his stature among them rivalled only by Mandela.{{sfn|Gish|2004|pp=79, 86}} In August 1983, South Africans opposed to apartheid formed the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] (UDF), with Tutu selected as one of the organisation's patrons.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=235|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=95|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=206}} Conversely, he angered the government as well as much of the press and white public.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=78}} Most of his critics were conservative whites who did not want apartheid to end.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=78}} He was criticised in pro-government press outlets like ''[[The Citizen (South Africa)|The Citizen]]'' and the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]],{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=202}} with this criticism often centring on how his middle-class lifestyle contrasted with the poverty of the blacks he claimed to represent.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=85}} He received [[hate mail]] as well as death threats from white far-right white groups like the [[Barend Strydom|Wit Wolwe]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=78|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=201}} His rhetoric of angry defiance against the government alienated many white liberals, who believed that apartheid could be gradually reformed away; among the white liberals who publicly criticised Tutu were [[Alan Paton]] and [[Bill Burnett]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=203‚Äì205}} He nevertheless remained close with other prominent white liberals like [[Helen Suzman]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=203}}

In 1984, Tutu embarked on a three-month sabbatical leave at the [[General Theological Seminary of the Episcopal Church]] in New York.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=200|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=95|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=211}} In the city, he was invited to address the [[United Nations Security Council]] in October,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=99}} and in December he met the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] and the subcommittees on Africa in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]], urging them to put pressure on South Africa.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=100}} He was also invited to the [[White House]] to visit President [[Ronald Reagan]]; he urged Reagan to change his approach to the South African government although was unsuccessful.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=207|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=100‚Äì101|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=249‚Äì250}} Referring to Reagan's decision to put Cold War alliances before the rights of black South Africans, Tutu later described Reagan as "a racist pure and simple".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=255}}

It was while in New York that Tutu was informed that he had won the 1984 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]; he had previously been nominated in 1981, 1982, and 1983.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=200|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=209‚Äì210}} When the Nobel Prize selection committee met to decide 1984's award, they agreed that it should go to a South African to recognise the problems in that country, deciding that Tutu would be a less controversial choice than other South African nominees Mandela and [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=210‚Äì211}} Tutu travelled to London, where he gave a public statement dedicating his award to "the little people" in South Africa.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=211‚Äì213}} In December, he attended the award ceremony in [[Oslo]]‚Äîwhich was hampered by a bomb scare‚Äîbefore returning home via Sweden, Denmark, Canada, Tanzania, and Zambia.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=208|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=101‚Äì102|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=219‚Äì220}} He shared the $192,000 prize money with his family, SACC staff, and a scholarship fund for South Africans in exile.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=215}} He was the second South African to receive the award, after [[Albert Luthuli]] in 1960.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=95}} The South African government and mainstream media either downplayed or criticised the award,{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=203|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=97‚Äì98}} while the [[Organisation of African Unity]] hailed it as evidence of apartheid's impending demise.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=96}}

===Bishop of Johannesburg: 1985‚Äì1986===

After Bavin retired as Bishop of Johannesburg, Tutu was among five candidates considered as his replacement. An elective assembly met at [[St Barnabas College (Johannesburg)|St Barnabas' College]] in October 1984 and although Tutu was one of the two most popular candidates, the white laity voting bloc consistently voted against his candidature. After a deadlock ensued, a bishops' synod was called to make the final decision; they decided to give the role to Tutu.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=210‚Äì211|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=105|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=217‚Äì218}} Black Anglicans celebrated, although many of their white co-religionists were angry at the selection.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=212|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=105|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=218}} Tutu was enthroned as the sixth Bishop of Johannesburg at a ceremony in St Mary's Cathedral in February 1985.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=107|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=220}} He was the first black man to hold the role,{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=210|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=105}} and took over the largest diocese in South Africa, comprising 102 parishes and 300,000 Anglican parishioners, approximately 80% of whom were black.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=108}} In his inaugural sermon, Tutu declared that he would call on the international community to introduce punitive economic sanctions against South Africa unless apartheid had not begun to be dismantled within 18 to 24 months.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=212‚Äì213|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=107|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=221}} As bishop, he resigned as patron of the UDF.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=221}}

Tutu sought to reassure white South Africans that he was not the "horrid ogre" some believed him to be, and as bishop he spent much time visiting white-majority parishes and wooing the support of white Anglicans in his diocese.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=212, 214|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=221}} Some white parishes had withdrawn their diocesan quota in protest at his appointment, but he was able to make up the shortfall by attracting foreign donations.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=215}} 

In the mid-1980s, there were an increasing number of clashes between angry black youths and the security services, resulting in a growing death toll; Tutu was invited to speak at many of their funerals, which attracted crowds of thousands.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=221|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=228}} At a funeral in [[Duduza]], he stepped in to prevent members of the crowd from killing a black man suspected to be a government informant.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=221‚Äì222|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=110|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=224‚Äì225}} He spoke out against the torture and killing of suspected collaborators, angering some of those in the black community.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=226}} For these young militants, Tutu and his calls for non-violence were perceived as an obstacle on the path to revolution;{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=111}} one young woman was quoted as saying that Tutu was "too moderate for most of us, too much within the system".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=111}} When Tutu accompanied the U.S. politician [[Ted Kennedy]] on the latter's speaking tour of South Africa in January 1985, he was angered and humiliated that protesters from the [[Azanian People's Organisation]] (AZAPO)‚Äîwho regarded Kennedy as an agent of capitalism and [[American imperialism]]‚Äîrepeatedly disrupted proceedings.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|pp=217‚Äì219}}

Amid the violence, the ANC called on black South Africans to make the country "ungovernable",{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=229}} while foreign companies increasingly disinvested in the country and the rand reached a record low.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=229‚Äì230}} In July 1985, Botha declared a state of emergency in 36 magisterial districts, further suspending civil liberties and giving the security services additional powers;{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=223‚Äì224|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=111|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=227}} Tutu criticised this, and offered to serve as a go-between for the government and leading black organisations, but was rebuffed by the former.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=227}} He also continued with his protests; in April 1985, Tutu led a small march of clergy through Johannesburg to protest the arrest of Reverend [[Geoff Moselane]].{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|pp=220‚Äì221}} In October 1985, he backed the [[National Initiative for Reconciliation]]'s proposal for people to refrain from work and engage in a day of prayer, fasting and mourning.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|pp=237‚Äì238}} He also proposed a [[General strike|national strike]] against apartheid, angering trade unions whom he had not consulted about such an idea.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|pp=238‚Äì239}}

Tutu had continued to make foreign visits to promote his cause. In May he embarked on a speaking tour of the U.S.,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=110}} and in October 1985 addressed the political committee of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] urging that the international community impose sanctions on South Africa if apartheid was not dismantled within six months.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=231}} He proceeded to the United Kingdom, where he met with Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=224|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=113}} He also announced the formation of a Bishop Tutu Scholarship Fund to financially assist South African students living in exile.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=113}} He returned to the U.S. in May 1986,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=116}} and in August 1986 visited Japan, China, and Jamaica to promote sanctions.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=118}} Given that most senior anti-apartheid activists were imprisoned, Mandela referred to Tutu as "public enemy number one for the powers that be".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=79}}

===Archbishop of Cape Town: 1986‚Äì1994===

[[File:Desmond Tutu, 1986 Jan (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Tutu on a visit to San Francisco in 1986]]

After [[Philip Russell (bishop)|Philip Russell]] announced his retirement as the [[Archbishop of Cape Town]],{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=121}} in February 1986 the [[Black Solidarity Group]] formed a plan to get Tutu appointed as his replacement.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=263‚Äì264}} At the time of the meeting, Tutu was in Atlanta, Georgia receiving the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Nonviolent Peace Prize]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=263}} Tutu's name was put forward for the position alongside that of [[Michael Nuttall]], although both expressed hesitation at the nomination. In the vote, Tutu secured a two-thirds majority from both the clergy and laity and was then ratified in a unanimous vote by the synod of bishops.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=248‚Äì249|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=121|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=264}} He was the first black man to hold the post.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=121}} Some white Anglicans left the church in protest at his election.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=254‚Äì255|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=265}} Over 1300 people attended his enthronement ceremony at the Cathedral of St George the Martyr.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=122|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=266}} After the ceremony, Tutu held an open-air Eucharist for 10,000 people at the Cape Showgrounds in Goodwood, where he invited [[Albertina Sisulu]] and [[Allan Boesak]] to give political speeches.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=259|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=267}}

On becoming archbishop, he moved into the post's official residence at [[Bishopscourt, Cape Town|Bishopscourt]]. He did so illegally, because he had not sought official permission to reside in what the state allocated as a "white area".{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=122‚Äì123|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=1, 268}} He obtained money from the church to oversee renovations of the house,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=269}} and had a children's playground installed in its ground, opening this and the Bishopscourt swimming pool open to members of his diocese.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=123|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=270}} He invited the English priest [[Francis Cull]] to set up the [[Institute of Christian Spirituality]] at Bishopscourt, with the latter moving into a building in the house's grounds.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=276}} Such projects led to Tutu's ministry taking up an increasingly large portion of the Anglican church's budget, which Tutu sought to expand through requesting donations from overseas.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=276}} Some Anglicans were critical of his spending.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=277}}

His work as archbishop, coupled with his political activism and regular foreign trips, led to him accumulating a vast workload, which he managed with the assistance of his executive officer [[Njongonkulu Ndungane]] and with Nuttall, who in 1989 was elected dean of the province.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=277‚Äì279}} In church meetings, Tutu drew upon traditional African custom by adopting a consensus-building model of leadership, seeking to ensure that competing groups in the church reached a compromise and thus all votes would be unanimous rather than divided.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=279}} He secured approval for the ordination of female priests in the Anglican church, having likened the exclusion of women from the position to the exclusionary system of apartheid.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=280}} He also appointed gay priests to senior positions and privately‚Äîalthough not at the time publicly‚Äîcriticised the church's insistence that gay priests remain celibate, regarding it as impractical.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=280‚Äì281}}

Along with Boesak and [[Stephen Naidoo]], Tutu became one of the church leaders involved in mediating conflicts between black protesters and the security forces; they for instance worked to avoid clashes at the 1987 funeral of ANC guerrilla [[Ashley Kriel]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=284‚Äì285}} In February 1988, the government banned 17 black or multi-racial organisations, including the UDF, and restricted the activities of trade unions. Church leaders organised a protest march, and after that too was banned they established the [[Committee for the Defense of Democracy]]. When the group's rally was banned, Tutu, Boesak, and Naidoo organised a service at St George's Cathedral to replace it.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=127|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=290}}

In March 1988, he took up the cause of the [[Sharpeville Six]] who had been sentenced to death; opposed on principle to [[capital punishment]], he called for their lives to be spared.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=1‚Äì4}} He telephoned representatives of the U.S., British, and German governments urging them to pressure Botha on the issue,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=4}} and personally met with Botha at the latter's [[Tuynhuys]] home to discuss the issue. The two did not get on well, and argued.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=127|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=1‚Äì5}} Botha accused Tutu of supporting the ANC's armed campaign; Tutu said that while he did not support their use of violence, he supported the ANC's objective of a non-racial, democratic South Africa.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=5‚Äì6}} The death sentences were ultimately commuted.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=6}}

In May 1988, the government launched a covert campaign against Tutu, organised in part by [[State Security Council#Stratkom|Stratkom]] wing of the [[State Security Council]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=293, 294}} The security police printed leaflets and stickers with anti-Tutu slogans while unemployed blacks were paid to protest at the airport when he arrived there.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=293, 294}} Traffic police arrested Leah and locked her in a cell when she was late to renew her motor vehicle license.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=294}} Although the security police organised assassination attempts on various anti-apartheid Christian leaders, they later claimed to have never done so for Tutu, regarding him as too high-profile.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=295}}

Tutu remained actively involved in acts of [[civil disobedience]] against the government; he was encouraged by the fact that many whites also took part in these protests.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=307}} In August 1989 he helped to organise an "Ecumenical Defiance Service" at St George's Cathedral,{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=301‚Äì302}} and shortly after joined protests at segregated beaches outside Cape Town.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=131|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=303}} To mark the sixth anniversary of the UDF's foundation he held a "service of witness" at the cathedral,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=304}} and in September organised a church memorial for those protesters who had been killed in clashes with the security forces.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=131|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=308}} He organised a protest march through Cape Town for later that month, which the new President [[F. W. de Klerk]] agreed to permit; a multi-racial crowd containing an estimated 30,000 people took part.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=132|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=308‚Äì311|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=397}} That the march had been permitted inspired similar demonstrations to take place across the country.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=311}} In October, de Klerk met with Tutu, Boesak, and [[Frank Chikane]]; Tutu was impressed that "we were listened to".{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=312‚Äì313}} In 1994, a further collection of Tutu's writings, ''The Rainbow People of God'', was published, and followed the next year with his ''An African Prayer Book'', a collection of prayers from across the continent accompanied by the Archbishop's commentary.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=144}}

====Dismantling of apartheid====

[[File:Nelson Mandela-2008 (edit).jpg|thumb|right|Tutu welcomed Mandela (pictured) to Bishopscourt when the latter was released from prison and later organised the religious component of his presidential inauguration ceremony.]]

In February 1990, de Klerk un-banned political parties like the ANC; Tutu phoned him to congratulate him on the move.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=135|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=313}} Shortly after, de Klerk announced that Mandela was to be released from prison. The ANC asked Tutu if Mandela and his wife Winnie could stay at Bishopscourt on the first night of his freedom, to which Tutu agreed.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=135‚Äì136|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=313|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=409}} They met for the first time in 35 years at Cape Town City Hall, where Mandela gave a speech to assembled crowds from the balcony.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=314}} Tutu invited Mandela to attend an Anglican synod of bishops in February 1990, at which the latter described Tutu as the "people's archbishop".{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=315‚Äì316}} At that synod, Tutu and the bishops decide to call for an end to foreign sanctions once the transition to universal suffrage was "irreversible", urged anti-apartheid groups to end their use of armed struggle, and ban Anglican clergy from belonging to political parties.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=316}} Many clergy protested about the latter point, particularly as it has been imposed without consultation.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=320}} Tutu publicly defended the decision, stating that if priests openly affiliated with political parties then it would prove divisive, particularly amid the growing violence between the supporters of rival parties throughout South Africa.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=320‚Äì321}}

In March, violence broke out between supporters of the ANC and of [[Inkatha Freedom Party|Inkatha]] in [[kwaZulu]]; Tutu cancelled a visit to the US to join the SACC delegation in talks within Mandela, de Klerk, and Inkatha leader [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] in [[Ulundi]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=317}} Church leaders urged Mandela and Buthelezi to hold a joint rally to quell the violent rivalry between their respective parties.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=319}} Although Tutu's relationship with Buthelezi had always been strained‚Äîparticularly due to Tutu's opposition to Buthelezi's collaboration in the apartheid government's [[Bantustan]] system‚Äîthe clergyman visited Buthelezi on a number of occasions to encourage his involvement in the democratic process.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=318‚Äì319}} As the ANC-Inkatha violence spread from kwaZulu into the Transvaal, Tutu toured affected townships in Witwatersrand, visiting those made homeless and calling for peace.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=137|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=321‚Äì322}} He visited the victims of the massacre at [[Sebokeng]],{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=137‚Äì138|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=323}} and later those of the [[Boipatong massacre]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=139|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=329}} 

Like many other activists, Tutu believed that there was a "[[Third Force (South Africa)|third force]]" stoking the tensions between the ANC and Inkatha; it later emerged that sectors of the intelligence agencies were supplying Inkatha with weapons to weaken the ANC's negotiating position.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=138|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=325}} Unlike some ANC figures, Tutu never accused de Klerk of personal complicity in these operations.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=325‚Äì326}} In November 1990, Tutu organised a "summit" at Bishopscourt attended by both church leaders and leaders of political groups like the ANC, PAC, and AZAPO, in which he encouraged them to call on their supporters to avoid violence and allow free political campaigning.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=138|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=328}} After the [[South African Communist Party]] leader [[Chris Hani]] was assassinated by a white man, Tutu served as preacher at Hani's funeral outside Soweto; despite his objections to Hani's Marxist beliefs, Tutu had admired him as an activist.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=140|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=333‚Äì334}} Amid these events, Tutu had experienced physical exhaustion and ill-health,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=327}} and he undertook a four-month sabbatical at [[Emory University]]'s Candler School of Theology in Atlanta, Georgia.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=138|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=329}}

Tutu had been exhilarated by the prospect that South Africa was transforming towards universal suffrage via a negotiated transition rather than a racial civil war.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=315}} He allowed his face to be used on posters encouraging South Africans to vote.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=142}} When the [[South African general election, 1994|April 1994 multi-racial general election]] took place, Tutu was visibly exuberant, telling reporters that "we are on cloud nine".{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=142|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=338}} He voted in Cape Town's [[Gugulethu]] township.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=142|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=338}} The ANC won the election and Mandela was declared president, overseeing the formation of a government of national unity.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=143|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=339}} Tutu attended Mandela's inauguration ceremony and had been responsible for planning its religious component; Tutu had insisted that it be a multi-religious ceremony, with Christian, Muslim, Jewish, and Hindu leaders taking part in prayers and readings.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=338‚Äì339}}

====International affairs====

Alongside his domestic work, he also turned his attention to events elsewhere in Africa, and in 1987 gave the keynote speech at the [[All Africa Conference of Churches]] (AACC) in [[Lom√©]], Togo. There, he called on churches to champion the oppressed throughout the continent, stating that "it pains us to have to admit that there is less freedom and personal liberty in most of Africa now then there was during the much-maligned colonial days."{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=347‚Äì348}} At the conference, he was elected president of the AACC, while [[Jos√© Belo]] was elected its general-secretary. Calling for an "African renaissance" across the continent, the pair formed a partnership that would last a decade.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=130|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=375}} In 1989 they visited Zaire to encourage the country's churches to distance themselves from Seko's autocratic government.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=130|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=375}} In 1994, he and Belo visited war-torn Liberia in a mission co-organised by the AACC and the [[Carter Center]]. There, they met [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]], but Tutu did not trust his promise of a ceasefire.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=376‚Äì377}} In 1995, Mandela sent Tutu to Nigeria to meet with Nigerian military leader [[Sani Abacha]] to request the release of imprisoned politicians [[Moshood Abiola]] and [[Olusegun Obasanjo]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=377}} In July 1995, he visited Rwanda a year after the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]], where he preached to 10,000 people in [[Kigali]]. Drawing on his experiences in South Africa, he called for justice to be tempered with mercy towards the Hutu who had orchestrated the genocide.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=377‚Äì378}} Tutu also travelled to other parts of world, for instance spending March 1989 in Panama and Nicaragua.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=130}}

Tutu also spoke out on the [[Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict]]. While in New York in 1989, he had praised God for the creation of the state of Israel and asserted its right to "territorial integrity and fundamental security against attacks from those who deny her right to exist".{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=129|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=383}} He visited [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] leader [[Yasser Arafat]] in Cairo, urging him to accept Israel's existence.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=385}} At the same time he expressed anger that Israel had supplied military hardware to South Africa during the apartheid era, expressing bemusement as to how the Jewish state could co-operate with a government that had contained many Nazi sympathisers.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=382‚Äì383, 384}} Referring to the [[Israeli-occupied territories]] in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, he stated that there were "deeply, deeply distressing" parallels with the situation in apartheid South Africa.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=384}} He called for the formation of a distinct Palestinian state,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=382}} and emphasised that his criticisms were of the Israeli government rather than Jews as a broader group.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=388}} At the invite of Palestinian bishop [[Samir Kafity]], he undertook a [[Christmas]] pilgrimage to Jerusalem, where he gave a sermon at [[Shepherd's Field]] near [[Bethlehem]], in which he called for a [[two-state solution]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=384, 386}} On that trip, he also visited the [[Yad Vashem]] Holocaust memorial, where he laid a wreath and spoke to journalists on the importance of forgiveness.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=386‚Äì387}} His calls to forgive those who perpetrated the Holocaust, coupled with his support for a Palestinian state, brought criticism from many Jewish groups across the world.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=387}} This was exacerbated by the fact that he sought to evade suspicions of [[anti-Semitism]] through comments such as "my dentist is a Dr. Cohen".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=385}}

Tutu also spoke out regarding [[The Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. At the Lambeth conference of 1988, he backed a resolution on the issue which condemned the use of violence by all sides; Tutu believed that, given Irish republicans had the right to vote, they had not exhausted peaceful means of bringing about change and thus should not resort to armed struggle.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=381}} Three years later, he gave a televised service from [[Dublin]]'s [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]] where he called for negotiations to take place between all factions, including the Irish republican [[Sinn F√©in]] and the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], groups which Thatcher's UK government had refused to engage with.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=381}} He visited [[Belfast]] in 1998 and again in 2001.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=382}}

==Later life==

[[File:Desmond Tutu.jpg|thumb|right|Tutu in 2009, speaking at the [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos, Switzerland in 2009]]

In October 1994, Tutu announced his intention to retire as archbishop in 1996.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=144}} Although retired archbishops normally return to the position of bishop, the other bishops bestowed on him a new title: "archbishop emeritus".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} A farewell ceremony was held at St George's Cathedral in June 1996, attended by senior politicians like Mandela and de Klerk.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} There, Mandela awarded Tutu the [[Order for Meritorious Service]], South Africa's highest honour.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} Tutu was succeeded as archbishop by Ndungane.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} 

In January 1997, Tutu was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] and travelled abroad for treatment.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=153|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=370}} He publicly revealed his diagnosis, hoping to encourage other men to go for prostate exams.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=153}} He faced recurrences of the disease in 1999 and 2006.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=370}} Back in South Africa, he divided his time between homes in Soweto's Orlando West and Cape Town's [[Milnerton]] area.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In 2000, he opened an office in Cape Town.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In June 2000, the Cape Town-based Desmond Tutu Peace Centre was launched, which in 2003 launched an Emerging Leadership Program.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}}

Conscious that his presence in South Africa might overshadow Ndungane, Tutu agreed to a two-year [[visiting professor|visiting professorship]] at Emory University.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} This took place between 1998 and 2000, and during the period he wrote a book about the TRC, ''No Future Without Forgiveness''.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=162}} In early 2002 he taught at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} From January to May 2003 he taught at the [[University of North Carolina]].{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} In January 2004, he was visiting professor of postconflict societies at KCL, his ''alma mater''.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} While in the United States, he signed up with a speakers' agency and travelled widely on speaking engagements; this gave him financial independence in a way that his clerical pension would not.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In his speeches, he focused on South Africa's transition from apartheid to universal suffrage, presenting it as a model for other troubled nations to adopt.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=161}} In the US, he thanked anti-apartheid activists for campaigning for sanctions, also calling for US companies to now invest in South Africa.{{sfn|Gish|2004|pp=161‚Äì162}} 

===Truth and Reconciliation Commission: 1996‚Äì1998===

Tutu popularised the term "[[Rainbow Nation]]" as a metaphor for [[post-apartheid South Africa]] after 1994 under ANC rule.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=520}} He had first used the metaphor in 1989 when he described a multi-racial protest crowd as the "rainbow people of God".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=391}} Tutu advocated what liberation theologians call "critical solidarity", offering support for pro-democracy forces while reserving the right to criticise his allies.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=315}} He criticised Mandela on several points, such as his tendency to wear brightly coloured [[Madiba shirt|Madiba shirts]], which he regarded as inappropriate; Mandela offered the tongue-in-cheek response that it was ironic coming from a man who wore dresses.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=345}} More serious was Tutu's criticism of Mandela's retention of South Africa's apartheid-era armaments industry and the significant pay packet that newly elected Members of Parliament adopted.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=143‚Äì144|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=345|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=517}} Mandela hit back, calling Tutu a "populist" and stating that he should have raised these issues privately rather than publicly.{{sfnm|1a1=Allen|1y=2006|1p=345|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2p=517}}

[[File:Archbishop Desmond Tutu on his 80th birthday (10666682906).jpg|thumb|left|Tutu on his eightieth birthday in 2011]]

A key question facing the post-apartheid government was how they would respond to the various human rights abuses that had been committed over the previous decades by both the state and by anti-apartheid activists. The National Party had wanted a comprehensive amnesty package whereas the ANC wanted trials of former state figures.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=343‚Äì344}} [[Alex Boraine]] helped Mandela's government to draw up legislation for the establishment of a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC), which was passed by parliament in July 1995.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=344‚Äì345}} Nuttall suggested that Tutu become one of the TRC's seventeen commissioners, while in September a synod of bishops formally nominated him.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=147|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=345}} Tutu proposed that the TRC adopt a threefold approach: the first being confession, with those responsible for human rights abuses fully disclosing their activities, the second being forgiveness in the form of a legal amnesty from prosecution, and the third being restitution, with the perpetrators making amends to their victims.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=344}}

Mandela named Tutu as the chair of the TRC, with Boraine as his deputy.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=147, 148|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=345‚Äì346|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=529}} The commission was a significant undertaking, employing over 300 staff, dividing into three committees, and holding as many as four hearings simultaneously.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=346}} In the TRC, Tutu advocated "restorative justice", something which he considered characteristic of traditional African jurisprudence "in the spirit of ''ubuntu''".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=347}} As head of the commission, Tutu had to deal with its various inter-personal problems, with much suspicion between those on its board who had been anti-apartheid activists and those who had supported the apartheid system.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=349}} He acknowledged that "we really were like a bunch of prima donnas, frequently hypersensitive, often taking umbrage easily at real or imagined slights".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}} Tutu opened meetings with prayers and often referred to Christian teachings when discussing the TRC's work, frustrating some who saw him as incorporating too many religious elements into an expressly secular body.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}}

The first hearing took place in April 1996.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}} The hearings were publicly televised and had a considerable impact on South African society.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=350}} He had very little control over the committee responsible for granting amnesty, instead chairing the committee which heard accounts of human rights abuses perpetrated by both anti-apartheid and apartheid figures.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=348}} While listening to the testimony of victims, Tutu was sometimes overwhelmed by emotion and cried during the hearings.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=352}} He singled out those victims who expressed forgiveness towards those who had harmed them and used these individuals as his leitmotif.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=351}} The ANC's image was tarnished by the revelations that some of its activists had engaged in torture, attacks on civilians, and other human rights abuses. It sought to suppress part of the final TRC report, infuriating Tutu.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=157|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=366‚Äì367|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3pp=531‚Äì532}} He warned of the ANC's "abuse of power", stating that "yesterday's oppressed can quite easily become today's oppressors... We've seen it happen all over the world and we shouldn't be surprised if it happens here".{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=532}} Tutu presented the five-volume TRC report to Mandela in a public ceremony in Pretoria in October 1998.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=157}} Ultimately, Tutu was pleased with the TRC's achievement, believing that it would aid long-term reconciliation, although recognised its short-comings.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=158}}

Post-apartheid, Tutu's status as a gay rights activist kept him in the public eye more than any other [[Anglican views of homosexuality|issue facing the Anglican Church]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=372}} Tutu regarded discrimination against homosexuals as being the equivalent to discrimination against black people and women,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=372}} and his views on this known through speeches and sermons.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=373}} After the 1998 Lambeth Conference of bishops reaffirmed the church's opposition to same-sex sexual acts, Tutu wrote to [[George Carey]] stating "I am ashamed to be an Anglican".{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=372‚Äì373}} He regarded the Archbishop of Canterbury [[Rowan Williams]] as too accommodating of conservatives who wanted to eject various US and Canadian Anglican churches from the Anglican Communion after they expressed a pro-LGB rights stance.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=373‚Äì374}} Tutu expressed the view that if these conservatives disliked the inclusiveness of the Anglican Communion, they always had "the freedom to leave".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=374}} In 2007, Tutu accused the church of being obsessed with homosexuality and declared: "If God, as they say, is homophobic, I wouldn't worship that God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7100295.stm |title=Desmond Tutu chides Church for gay stance |website=BBC News |date=18 November 2007 |accessdate=25 May 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903172341/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7100295.stm |archivedate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he called on the Anglican Church of Southern Africa to accept and conduct same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/desmond-tutu/religion-homosexuality_b_874804.html|title=All Are God's Children: On Including Gays and Lesbians in the Church and Society |author=Desmond Tutu |date=11 June 2011 |website=The Huffington Post |accessdate=12 August 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803215812/http://www.huffingtonpost.com:80/desmond-tutu/religion-homosexuality_b_874804.html |archivedate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tutu also spoke out on the need to combat the [[HIV/AIDS]] pandemic, in June 2003 stating that "Apartheid tried to destroy our people and apartheid failed. If we don't act against HIV-AIDS, it may succeed, for it is already decimating our population".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=166}} On the April 2005 election of [[Pope Benedict XVI]]‚Äîwho was known for his conservative views on issues of gender and sexuality‚ÄîTutu described it as unfortunate that the Roman Catholic Church was now unlikely to change its opposition to the use of [[condoms]] "amidst the fight against HIV/AIDS" nor its opposition to the ordination of women priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4463873.stm |title=Africans hail conservative Pope |website=BBC News |date=20 April 2005 |accessdate=26 May 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313044706/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4463873.stm |archivedate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help combat child trafficking, in 2006 Tutu launched a global campaign, organised by the aid organisation [[Plan (aid organisation)|Plan]], to ensure that all children are registered at birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4289393.stm |title=Tutu calls for child registration |date= 22 February 2005 |website=BBC News |accessdate=23 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007233951/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4289393.stm |archivedate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tutu retained his interest in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and after the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]] was invited to [[Tel Aviv]] to attend the [[Peres Centre for Peace]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=388}} He became increasingly frustrated following the collapse of the [[2000 Camp David Summit]],{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=388}} and in 2002 gave a widely publicised speech denouncing Israeli policy regarding the Palestinians and calling for sanctions against Israel.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=388}} Comparing the Israeli-Palestinian situation with that in South Africa, he said that "one reason we succeeded in South Africa that is missing in the Middle East is quality of leadership - leaders willing to make unpopular compromises, to go against their own constituencies, because they have the wisdom to see that would ultimately make peace possible."{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=388}} Tutu was named to head a United Nations fact-finding mission to [[Beit Hanoun]] in the [[Gaza Strip]] to investigate the [[Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident|November 2006 incident]] in which soldiers from the [[Israel Defense Forces]] killed 19 civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |title=Tutu to head UN rights mission to Gaza |date=29 November 2006 |author=Jacob Slosberg |website=Jerusalem Post |url=https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Tutu-to-head-UN-rights-mission-to-Gaza |accessdate=10 June 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319215130/https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Tutu-to-head-UN-rights-mission-to-Gaza |archivedate=19 March 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; Israeli officials expressed concern that the report would be biased against Israel.

In 2003, Tutu was the scholar in residence at the [[University of North Florida]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=388}} It was there, in February, that he broke his normal rule on not joining protests outside South Africa by taking part in a New York demonstration against plans for the U.S. to launch the [[Iraq War]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=164|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=388‚Äì389}} He telephoned [[Condoleezza Rice]] urging the U.S. government not to go to war without a resolution from the [[United Nations Security Council]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=389}} Tutu questioned why Iraq was being singled out for allegedly possessing [[weapons of mass destruction]] when Europe, India, and Pakistan also had many such devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |title=Tutu condemns Blair's Iraq stance |website=BBC News |date=5 January 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2628607.stm |accessdate=23 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060604020148/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2628607.stm |archivedate=4 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he appeared in ''[[Honor Bound to Defend Freedom]]'', an [[Off Broadway]] play in New York City critical of the U.S. detention of prisoners at [[Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba|Guant√°namo Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |title=Tutu in anti-Guantanamo theatre |website=BBC News |date=2 October 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3709288.stm |accessdate=23 January 2008 |author=Jeremy Cooke |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525193742/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3709288.stm |archivedate=25 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2005, he added his voice to the growing dissent over terrorist suspects held at Guant√°namo's [[Camp X-Ray]], stating that these detentions without trial were "utterly unacceptable" and comparable to the apartheid-era detentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |title=Tutu calls for Guantanamo release |website=BBC News |date=12 January 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4167369.stm |accessdate=22 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230175304/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4167369.stm |archivedate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticised the UK's introduction of measures to detain terrorist subjects for 28 days without trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |title=Tutu calls for Guantanamo closure |website=BBC News |date=17 February 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4723512.stm |accessdate=22 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222190031/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4723512.stm |archivedate=22 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012, he called for U.S. President [[George W.

In 2004, he gave the inaugural lecture at the Church of Christ the King, where he commended the achievements made in South Africa over the previous decade although warned of widening wealth disparity among its population.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=392}} He questioned the government's spending on armaments, its policy regarding Mugabe's government in Zimbabwe, and the manner in which [[Nguni languages|Nguni-speakers]] dominated senior positions, stating that this latter issue would stoke ethnic tensions.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=392}} He made the same points three months later when giving the annual Nelson Mandela Lecture in Johannesburg.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=392}} There, he charged the ANC under Mbeki's leadership of demanding "sycophantic, obsequious conformity" among its members.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=393}} Tutu and Mbeki had long had a strained relationship; Mbeki had accused Tutu of criminalising the ANC's military struggle against apartheid through the TRC, while Tutu disliked Mbeki's active neglect of the HIV/AIDS pandemic.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=393}} Like Mandela before him, Mbeki accused Tutu of being a populist, further claiming that the cleric had no understanding of the ANC's inner workings.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=393}} Tutu later criticised ANC leader and South African President [[Jacob Zuma]]; in 2006, he criticised Zuma's "moral failings" as a result of accusations of rape and corruption that he was facing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5384310.stm |title=S Africa is losing its way ‚Äì Tutu |date=27 September 2006 |website=BBC News |accessdate=10 June 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308122917/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5384310.stm |archivedate=8 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he again criticised South Africa's policy of "quiet diplomacy" toward Mugabe's government, calling for the [[Southern Africa Development Community]] to chair talks between Mugabe's [[ZANU-PF]] and the opposition [[Movement for Democratic Change ‚Äì Tsvangirai|Movement for Democratic Change]], to set firm deadlines for action, with consequences if they were not met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/09/19/wtutu119.xml |title=Zimbabwe needs your help, Tutu tells Brown|date= 19 September 2007 |website=The Daily Telegraph  |accessdate=4 April 2008 |first1=Peta |last1=Thornycroft |first2=Sebastien |last2=Berger}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he called for a [[United Nations peacekeeping|UN Peacekeeping]] force to be sent to Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7479696.stm |title=Tutu urges Zimbabwe intervention |date=29 June 2008 |website=BBC News |accessdate=10 June 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224125214/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7479696.stm |archivedate=24 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[31st G8 summit]] at [[Gleneagles (Scotland)|Gleneagles, Scotland]], in 2005, Tutu called on world leaders to promote free trade with poorer countries and to end expensive taxes on anti-AIDS drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4356821.stm |title=Archbishop Tutu calls for G8 help |date=17 March 2005 |website=BBC News |accessdate=23 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230062048/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4356821.stm |archivedate=30 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TutuCOP17.JPG|thumb|Tutu at the COP17 "We Have Faith: Act Now for Climate Justice Rally", in Durban, November 2011]]

In October 2010, Tutu announced his retirement from public life so that he could spend more time "at home with my family - reading and writing and praying and thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/07/22/south.africa.tutu.retires/index.html#fbid=ZeXEgKJ1qcV |title=South Africa's Tutu Announces Retirement |website=CNN |date=22 July 2010 |accessdate=25 May 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831090429/http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/07/22/south.africa.tutu.retires/index.html |archivedate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, Tutu declared that he would no longer vote for the ANC, stating that while the party was "very good at leading us in the struggle to be free from oppression", it had done a poor job in countering inequality, violence, and corruption in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=South Africa's Desmond Tutu: 'I will not vote for ANC' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22478916 |accessdate=5 June 2013 |website=BBC News |date=10 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203011352/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22478916 |archivedate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, he welcomed Raphele's launch of a new party, [[Agang South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |title=Tutu endorses Ramphele's Agang SA |date=21 June 2013 |author=Natasha Marrian |website=Business Day |url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/politics/2013-06-21-tutu-endorses-rampheles-agang-sa/ |accessdate=25 May 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525204614/https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/politics/2013-06-21-tutu-endorses-rampheles-agang-sa/ |archivedate=25 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Mandela died in December 2013, Tutu initially stated that he had not been invited to the funeral, but the government denied this and Tutu subsequently announced that he would attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/desmond-tutu-changes-mind-going-to-mandela-funeral-1.2464192 |title=Desmond Tutu changes mind, going to Mandela funeral |website=CBC News |date=14 December 2013 |accessdate=18 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118171239/http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/desmond-tutu-changes-mind-going-to-mandela-funeral-1.2464192 |archivedate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He publicly criticised the memorials held for Mandela, stating that they had given too much prominence to the ANC and that Afrikaners had been marginalised from them, believing that Mandela himself would have been appalled by this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Chothia Farouk |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25413501 |title=Archbishop Tutu: Nelson Mandela services excluded Afrikaners |website=BBC News |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=18 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517225759/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25413501 |archivedate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tutu also maintained an interest in social issues.

Tutu also continued to comment on international affairs.

==Personal life and personality==

{{Quote box
| quote =[Tutu's] extravert nature conceals a private, introvert side that needs space and regular periods of quiet; his jocularity runs alongside a deep seriousness; his occasional bursts of apparent arrogance mask a genuine humility before God and his fellow men. He is a true son of Africa who can move easily in European and American circles, a man of the people who enjoys ritual and episcopal splendour, a member of an established Church, in some ways a traditionalist, who takes a radical, provocative and fearless stand against authority if he sees it to be unjust. It is usually the most spiritual who can rejoice in all created things and Tutu has no problem in reconciling the sacred and the secular, but critics note a conflict between his socialist ideology and his desire to live comfortably, dress well and lead a life that, while unexceptional in Europe or America, is considered affluent, tainted with capitalism, in the eyes of the deprived black community of South Africa.

Du Boulay noted that Tutu was "a man of many layers" and "contradictory tensions".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=18}} His personality has been described as warm,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=35}} exuberant,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=35}} and outgoing.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=53}} Du Boulay noted that his "typical African warmth and a spontaneous lack of inhibition" proved shocking to many of the "reticent English" whom he encountered when in England,{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=68}} but that it also meant that he had the "ability to endear himself to virtually everyone who actually meets him".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=239}} 

Du Boulay noted that as a child, Tutu had been hard-working and "unusually intelligent".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=28}} She added that he had a "gentle, caring temperament and would have nothing to do with anything that hurt others",{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=29}} commenting on how he had "a quicksilver mind a disarming honesty".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=181}} Tutu was rarely angry in his personal contacts with others, although could become so if he felt that his integrity was being challenged.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=171}} He had a tendency to be highly trusting, something which some of those close to whom sometimes believed was unwise in various situations.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=73}} He was also reportedly bad at managing finances and prone to overspending, resulting in accusations of irresponsibility and extravagance.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=62}} 

Tutu had a passion for preserving African traditions of courtesy.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=115}} He could be offended by discourteous behaviour and careless language,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=53}} as well as by [[Profanity|swearing]] and ethnic slurs.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=133|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=73}} He could get very upset if a member of his staff forgot to thank him or did not apologise for being late to a prayer session.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=133}} He also disliked gossip and discouraged it among his staff.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=73|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=170}} He was very punctual,{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=114}} and insisted on punctuality among those in his employ.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=170, 275}} Du Boulay noted that "his attention to the detail of people's lives is remarkable", for he would be meticulous in recording and noting people's birthdays and anniversaries.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=137}} He was attentive to his parishioners, making an effort to regularly visit and spend time with them; this included making an effort to visit parishioners who disliked him.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|pp=134‚Äì136}}

According to Du Boulay, Tutu had "a deep need to be loved",{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=18}} a facet that the clergyman recognised about himself and referred to as a "horrible weakness".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=133}} Tutu has also been described as being sensitive,{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=133|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=53}} and very easily hurt, an aspect of his personality which he concealed from the public eye;{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=133}} Du Boulay noted that he "reacts to emotional pain" in an "almost childlike way".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=148}} He never denied being ambitious,{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|pp=247‚Äì248}} and acknowledged that he enjoyed the limelight which his position gave him, something that his wife often teased him about.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=272}} He was, according to Du Boulay, "a man of passionate emotions" who was quick to both laugh and cry.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=133}}

As well as English, Tutu could speak Zulu, Sotho, Tswana, and Xhosa.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=114}} Tutu was often praised for his public speaking abilities; Du Boulay noted that his "star quality enables him to hold an audience spellbound".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=157}} Gish noted that "Tutu's voice and manner could light up an audience; he never sounded puritanical or humourless".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=76}} Quick witted, he used humour to try and win over audiences.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=103}} He had a talent for [[mimicry]] but, according to Du Boulay, "his humour has none of the cool acerbity that makes for real wit".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=65}} His application of humour included jokes that made a point about apartheid;{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=192}} "the whites think the black people want to drive them into the sea. What they forget is, with apartheid on the beaches - we can't even ''go'' to the sea."{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=100}} In a speech made at the Sixth Assembly of the World Council of Churches in Vancouver, he for instance drew laughs from the audience for referring to South Africa as having a "few local problems".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=194}}

[[File:Tutu meets Schweitzer (8).jpg|thumb|left|240px|Tutu with his daughter Mpho Andrea in the Netherlands, 2012]]

Tutu had a lifelong love of literature and reading,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=11}} and was a fan of cricket.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=133|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=75}} To relax, he enjoyed listening to [[classical music]] and reading books on politics or religion.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=123}} His favourite foods included [[samosas]], [[marshmallows]], [[Vetkoek|fat cakes]], and [[Yogi Sip]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=133|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=75}} When hosts asked what his culinary tastes were, his wife responded: "think of a five year old".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=272}} 
Tutu awoke at 4{{nbsp}}am each morning, before engaging in an early morning walk, prayers, and the Eucharist.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=133, 141|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=274}} On Fridays, he fasted until supper.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=275}} 

Tutu was a committed Christian since boyhood.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=23}} Prayer was a big part of his life; he often spent an hour in prayer at the start of each day, and would ensure that every meeting or interview that he was part of was preceded by a short prayer.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=141}} He was even known to often pray while driving.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=141}} He reads the Bible every day.&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/12/15/ctw.tutu.climate.interview/index.html| title=Tutu urges leaders to agree climate deal|date=15 December 2009|accessdate=15 December 2009 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tutu says he reads the Bible every day and recommends that people read it as a collection of books, not a single constitutional document: &lt;!-- don't copy-edit the direct quote --&gt;
"You have to understand is that the Bible is really a library of books and it has different categories of material," he said.
"There are certain parts which you have to say no to. The Bible accepted slavery. St Paul said women should not speak in church at all and there are people who have used that to say women should not be ordained. There are many things that you shouldn't accept."&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"/&gt;

On 2 July 1955, Tutu married [[Nomalizo Leah Tutu|Nomalizo Leah Shenxane]], a teacher whom he had met while at college. They had four children: Trevor Thamsanqa, Theresa Thandeka, Naomi Nontombi and Mpho Andrea, all of whom attended the [[Waterford Kamhlaba]] School in [[Swaziland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helpkids.org.za/pages.php?id=26|publisher=Cape Town Child Welfare|title=Our Patron ‚Äì Archbishop Desmond Tutu|accessdate=6 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518020115/http://www.helpkids.org.za/pages.php?id=26|archivedate=18 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Du Boulay referred to him as "a loving and concerned father",{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=81}} while Allen described him as a "loving but strict father" to his children.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=170}}

==Ideology==

===Anti-apartheid and political views===

[[File:ApartheidSignEnglishAfrikaans.jpg|thumb|right|Apartheid legislation impacted all areas of life]]
Allen stated that the theme running through Tutu's campaigning was that of "democracy, human rights and tolerance, to be achieved by dialogue and accommodation between enemies."{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=374}} Racial equality was one of his core principles,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=xii}} and his opposition to apartheid was unequivocal.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=157}} He believed that the apartheid system had to be wholly dismantled rather than being reformed in a piecemeal fashion.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=252|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=76}} Tutu compared the apartheid ethos of South Africa's National Party to the ideas of the [[Nazi Party]], and drew comparisons between apartheid policy and the [[Holocaust]]. He noted that whereas the latter was a quicker and more efficient way of exterminating whole populations, the National Party's policy of forcibly relocating black South Africans to areas where they lacked access to food and sanitation had much the same result.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=212}} In his words, "Apartheid is as evil and as vicious as Nazism and Communism".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=84}}

Despite his experiences under the white-minority government, Tutu never became anti-white, in part due to the many positive experiences that he had had with white people in both South Africa and Britain.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=129}} He promoted racial reconciliation between South Africa's different communities, believing that most blacks fundamentally wanted to live in harmony with whites,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=80}} although he stressed that reconciliation would only be possible among equals, after blacks had been given full civil rights.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=100}} In his speeches, he stressed that it was apartheid itself‚Äîrather than white people‚Äîthat was the enemy.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=68}} He tried to cultivate goodwill from the country's white community, making a point of showing white individuals gratitude when they made concessions to black demands.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=80}} He also spoke to many white audiences, urging them to support his cause, referring to it as the "winning side",{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=161|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=81}} and reminding them that when apartheid had been overthrown, black South Africans would remember who their friends had been.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=186}} When he held public prayers, he always included mention of those who upheld the apartheid system, such as politicians and police, as well as the system's victims, emphasising his view that all humans were the children of God.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=74}} He stated that "the people who are perpetrators of injury in our land are not sporting horns or tails. They're just ordinary people who are scared. Wouldn't you be scared if you were outnumbered five to one?"{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=191|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=91|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=239}}

Tutu was always committed to non-violent activism,{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=243|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=xii}} and in his speeches was also cautious never to threaten or endorse violence, even when he warned that it was a likely outcome of government policy.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=162|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=77}} He nevertheless described himself as a "man of peace" rather than a [[pacifism|pacifist]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=77|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=212}} He for instance accepted that violence had been necessary to stop Nazism.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=77}} In the South African situation, he criticised the use of violence by both the government and anti-apartheid groups, although was also critical of white South Africans who would only condemn the use of violence by the latter, regarding such a position as a case of double-standards.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=77}} To end apartheid, he advocated foreign economic pressure be put on South Africa.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=77}} To critics who claimed that this measure would only cause further hardship for impoverished black South Africans, he responded that said communities were already experiencing significant hardship and that it would be better if they were "suffering with a purpose".{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=160|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=90}}

[[File:Desmond tutu wef.jpg|thumb|left|Tutu at the [[World Economic Forum]] in 2009]]

During the apartheid period, he criticised the black leaders of the Bantustans, describing them as "largely corrupt men looking after their own interests, lining their pockets";{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=168}} Buthelezi, the leader of the Zulu Bantustan, privately claimed that there was "something radically wrong" with Tutu's personality.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=265}} In the 1980s, he also condemned Western political leaders, namely Reagan, Thatcher, and West Germany's [[Helmut Kohl]], for retaining links with the South African government, stipulating that "support of this racist policy is racist".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=257}} Regarding Reagan, he stated that although he once thought him a "crypto-racist" for his soft stance on the National Party administration, he would "say now that he is a racist pure and simple".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=255}} He and his wife boycotted a lecture given at the Federal Theological Institute by former British Prime Minister [[Alec Douglas-Home]] in the 1960s; Tutu noted that they did so because Britain's [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] had "behaved abominably over issues which touched our hearts most nearly".{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=77|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=105}} Later in life, he also spoke out against various African leaders, for instance describing Zimbabwe's [[Robert Mugabe]] as the "caricature of an African dictator", who had "gone bonkers in a big way".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=377}}

According to Du Boulay, "Tutu's politics spring directly and inevitably from his Christianity".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=164}} He believed that it was the duty of Christians to oppose unjust laws,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=75}} and that there could be no separation between the religious and the political just as‚Äîaccording to Anglican theology‚Äîthere is no separation between the spiritual realm (the Holy Ghost) and the material one (Jesus Christ).{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=87}} However, he was adamant that he was not personally a politician.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=164}} He felt that religious leaders like himself should stay outside of party politics, citing the example of [[Abel Muzorewa]] in Zimbabwe, [[Makarios III]] in Cyprus, and [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] in Iran as examples in which such crossovers proved problematic.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=164|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=206}} He tried to avoid alignment with any particular political party; in the 1980s he for instance signed a plea urging anti-apartheid activists in the United States to support both the ANC and the [[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania|Pan Africanist Congress]] (PAC).{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=206‚Äì207}} Du Boulay however noted that Tutu was "most at home" with the UDF umbrella organisation,{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=234}} and that his views on a multi-racial alliance against apartheid placed him closer to the approach of the ANC and UDF than the blacks-only approach favoured by the PAC and Black Consciousness groups like AZAPO.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=236}} When, in the late 1980s, there were suggestions that he should take political office, he rejected the idea.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=125}}

When pressed to describe his ideological position, Tutu has described himself as a [[socialism|socialist]].{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=236}} In 1986 he related that "All my experiences with capitalism, I'm afraid, have indicated that it encourages some of the worst features in people. Eat or be eaten. It is underlined by the survival of the fittest. I can't buy that. I mean, maybe it's the awful face of capitalism, but I haven't seen the other face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=Desmond Tutu |author=Earley, Pete |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/1986/02/16/desmond-tutu/3fc3da7f-4926-44cf-896a-5d1bf7f00206/ |website=The Washington Post |date=16 February 1986 |accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the 1980s, he was reported as saying that "apartheid has given free enterprise a bad name".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=248}} While identifying with socialism, he opposed forms of socialism like Marxism-Leninism which promoted communism, being critical of Marxism-Leninism's promotion of [[atheism]].{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=236}} Tutu has often used the aphorism that "African communism" is an oxymoron because‚Äîin his view‚ÄîAfricans are intrinsically spiritual and this conflicts with the atheistic nature of Marxism.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=66}} He was critical of the Marxist governments in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Bloc]], comparing the way that they treated their populations with the way that the National Party treated South Africans.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=212}} In 1985 he stated that he hated Marxism-Leninism "with every fiber of my being" although sought to explain why black South Africans turned to it as an ally: "when you are in a dungeon and a hand is stretched out to free you, you do not ask for the pedigree of the hand owner."{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=237|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=107}}

Mandela had foregrounded the idea of ''[[Ubuntu theology|Ubuntu]]'' as being of importance to South Africa's political framework.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=10}} In 1986, Tutu had defined Ubuntu: "It refers to gentleness, to compassion, to hospitality, to openness to others, to vulnerability, to be available to others and to know that you are bound up with them in the bundle of life."{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=10}} Reflecting this view of ubuntu, Tutu was fond of the Xhosa saying that "a person is a person through other persons".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=114}}

===Theology===

[[File:Desmond Tutu - Kirchentag Cologne 2007 (7137).jpg|thumb|right|Tutu in Cologne in 2007]]

Tutu was attracted to Anglicanism because of what he saw as its tolerance and inclusiveness, its appeal to reason alongside scripture and tradition, and the freedom that its constituent churches had from any centralized authority.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=373}} Tutu's approach to Anglicanism has been characterised as [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] in nature.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=239‚Äì240}} He regarded the Anglican Communion as a family, replete with its internal squabbles.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=259|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=373}}

Tutu rejected the idea that any particular variant of theology was universally applicable, instead maintaining that all understandings of God had to be "contextual" in relating to the socio-cultural conditions in which they existed.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=116|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=135}} 
In the 1970s, Tutu became an advocate of both black theology and African theology, seeking ways to fuse the two schools of Christian theological thought.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=136, 137}} Unlike other theologians, like John Mbiti, who saw the traditions as largely incompatible, Tutu emphasised the similarities between the two.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=115}}
He believed that both theological approaches had arisen in contexts where black humanity had been defined in terms of white norms and values, in societies where "to be really human", the black man "had to see himself and to be seen as a chocolate coloured white man."{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=116}} He also argued that both black and African theology shared a repudiation of the supremacy of Western values.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=116}} In doing so he spoke of an underlying unity of Africans and the African diaspora, stating that "All of us are bound to Mother Africa by invisible but tenacious bonds. She has nurtured the deepest things in us blacks."{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=115}}

He became, according to Du Boulay, "one of the most eloquent and persuasive communicators" of black theology.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=87}} He expressed his views on theology largely through sermons and addresses rather than in extended academic treatises.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=87}}
Tutu expressed the view that Western theology sought answers to questions that Africans were not asking.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=135‚Äì136}} For Tutu, two major questions were being posed by African Christianity: how to replace imported Christian expressions of faith with something authentically African, and how to liberate people from bondage.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=136}} He believed that there were many comparisons to be made between contemporary African understandings of God and those featured in the Old Testament.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=137}} He nevertheless criticised African theology for failing to sufficiently address contemporary societal problems, and suggested that to correct this it should learn from the black theology tradition.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=116}}

When chairing the TRC, Tutu advocated an explicitly Christian model of reconciliation, as part of which he believed that South Africans had to face up to the damages that they had caused and accept the consequences of their actions.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}} As part of this, he believed that the perpetrators and beneficiaries of apartheid must admit to their actions but that the system's victims should respond generously, stating that it was a "gospel imperative" to forgive.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}} At the same time, he argued that those responsible had to display true repentance in the form of restitution.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}}

==Reception and legacy==

[[File:Desmond tutu 20070607 2.jpg|thumb|Tutu at the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]], 2007]]

Gish noted that by the time of apartheid's fall, Tutu had attained "worldwide respect" for his "uncompromising stand for justice and reconciliation and his unmatched integrity".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=148}} According to Allen, Tutu "made a powerful and unique contribution to publicizing the antiapartheid struggle abroad", particularly in the United States.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=233}} In the latter country, he was able to rise to prominence as a South African anti-apartheid activist because‚Äîunlike Mandela and other members of the ANC‚Äîhe had no links to the South African Communist Party and thus was more acceptable to Americans amid the Cold War anti-communist sentiment of the period.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=253}} In the U.S., he was often compared to Martin Luther King, with the African-American civil rights activist [[Jesse Jackson]] referring to him as "the Martin Luther King of South Africa"; this was a comparison that Tutu was embarrassed by.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=198}}
After the end of apartheid, Tutu became "perhaps the world's most prominent religious leader advocating gay and lesbian rights", according to Allen.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=372}} Ultimately, Allen thought that perhaps Tutu's "greatest legacy" was the fact that he gave "to the world as it entered the twenty-first century an African model for expressing the nature of human community".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=396}}

During Tutu's rise to notability during the 1970s and 1980s, responses to him were "sharply polarized".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=201}} Noting that he was "simultaneously loved and hated, honoured and vilified",{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=170}} Du Boulay attributed his divisive reception to the fact that "strong people evoke strong emotions".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=138}} Tutu gained much adulation from black journalists, inspired imprisoned anti-apartheid activists, and led to many black parents naming their children after him.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=201}} For many black South Africans, he was a respected religious leader and a symbol of black achievement.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=247}} By 1984 he was‚Äîaccording to Gish‚Äî"the personification of the South African freedom struggle".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=103}} In 1988, Du Boulay described him as "a spokesman for his people, a voice for the voiceless".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=18}} 

The response he received from South Africa's white minority was more mixed. Most of those who criticised him were conservative whites who did not want a shift away from apartheid and white-minority rule.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=138|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=78}} Many of these whites were angered that he was calling for economic sanctions against South Africa and that he was warning that racial violence was impending.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=98}} Said whites often accused him of being a tool of the communists.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=236}} This hostility was exacerbated by the government's campaign to discredit Tutu and distort his image,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=97}} which included repeatedly misquoting him to present his statements out of context.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=263}} According to Du Boulay, the SABC and much of the white press went to "extraordinary attempts to discredit him", something that "made it hard to know the man himself".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=18}} Allen noted that in 1984, Tutu was "the black leader white South Africans most loved to hate" and that this antipathy extended beyond supporters of the far-right government to liberals too.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=202}} The fact that he was "an object of hate" for many was something that deeply pained him.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=138}}

Tutu also drew criticism from within the anti-apartheid movement and the black South African community. He was criticised repeatedly for making statements on behalf of black South Africans without consulting other community leaders first.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=239}} Some black anti-apartheid activists regarded him as too moderate,{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=138|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=79}} and in particular too focused on cultivating white goodwill.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=79}} The African-American civil rights campaigner Bernice Powell for instance complained that he was "too nice to white people".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=242}} According to Gish, Tutu "faced the perpetual dilemma of all moderates - he was often viewed suspiciously by the two hostile sides he sought to bring together".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=79}} Tutu's critical view of Marxist-oriented communism and the governments of the [[Eastern Bloc]], and the comparisons he drew between these administrations and far-right ideologies like Nazism and apartheid brought criticism from the South African Communist Party in 1984.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=214}} After the transition to universal suffrage, Tutu's criticism of presidents Mbeki and Zuma brought objections from their supporters; in 2006, Zuma's personal advisor [[Elias Khumalo]] claimed that it as a double standard that Tutu could "accept the apology from the apartheid government that committed unspeakable atrocities against millions of South Africans", yet "cannot find it in his heart to accept the apology" from Zuma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |url=http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=282735&amp;area=/insight/insight__national/ |author=

Tutu gained many international awards and honorary degrees, particularly in South Africa, the United Kingdom, and United States.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} By 2003, he had approximately 100 honorary degrees;{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=164}} he was, for example, the first person to be awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[Ruhr University]] of West Germany, and only the third person whom [[Columbia University]] in the U.S. agreed to award an honorary doctorate off-campus to.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|pp=188‚Äì189}}  Many schools and scholarships were named after him.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} For instance, in 2000 the Munsieville Library in Klerksdorp was renamed the Desmond Tutu Library.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} At Fort Hare University, the Desmond Tutu School of Theology was launched in 2002.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}}

On 16 October 1984, the then Bishop Tutu was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. The Nobel Committee cited his "role as a unifying leader figure in the campaign to resolve the problem of apartheid in South Africa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/1984/press.html|title=The Nobel Peace Prize for 1984|publisher=[[Norwegian Nobel Committee]]|accessdate=26 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen as a gesture of support for him and The South African Council of Churches which he led at that time. In 1987 Tutu was awarded the [[Pacem in Terris Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=S6UYpCoGUkgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=1987+Tutu+was+awarded+the+Pacem+in+Terris+Award|title = Desmond Tutu: A Biography |last = Gish|first = Steven|year = 1963|publisher=Greenwood Press|place = Westport, Connecticut|accessdate=6 June 2008|page = 126|isbn = 978-0-313-32860-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after a 1963 [[encyclical]] letter by [[Pope John XXIII]] that calls upon all people of good will to secure peace among all nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url = http://www.habitat.org/newsroom/2007archive/11_01_2007_HFH_Freedom_Award.aspx|title = Habitat for Humanity Lebanon Chairman to receive prestigious Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award|date = 1 November 2007|accessdate = 6 June 2008|publisher = Habitat for Humanity|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080705175359/http://www.habitat.org/newsroom/2007archive/11_01_2007_HFH_Freedom_Award.aspx|archivedate = 5 July 2008|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Arduin moved to [[Finland]]. For 15 years she worked as a guide in Finnish [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] and received dual citizenship. She said that she had grown up in the [[Alps]], that she had been orphaned at an early age, had recovered from [[cancer]] and had been the only child aside from a dead sister. This backstory of hers was discovered to be lies after her disappearance.

Arduin reached the [[Magnetic North Pole]] in the spring 2001. She was rescued after the first failed attempt to reach the geographic [[North Pole]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="urlEverest news - Mount Everest by climbers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mounteverest.net/story/stories/TheMessnerofAsiagoingforthePolesApr282003.shtml |title=Everest news - Mount Everest by climbers |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2003-04-16 |work= |publisher= |pages= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ZV3uzMJb?url=http://www.mounteverest.net/story/stories/TheMessnerofAsiagoingforthePolesApr282003.shtml |archivedate=2008-07-22 |accessdate=2008-07-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her toes had to be amputated due to [[frostbite]].&lt;ref name="urlMount Everest news - Mount Everest by climbers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mounteverest.net/story/ExplorersWebWeekinReviewNov282003.shtml |title=Mount Everest news - Mount Everest by climbers |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2008-11-28 |work= |publisher= |pages= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ZV3ykTvl?url=http://www.mounteverest.net/story/ExplorersWebWeekinReviewNov282003.shtml |archivedate=2008-07-22 |accessdate=2008-07-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her disappearance the Finnish author Sven Pahajoki decided to write a book about her life and while researching her background, realized she'd been lying all along about her accomplishments and life. Her sister and uncle were found and it was found out she'd done disappearances earlier as well and that they did not believe she had died, but just done another disappearance to start anew yet another time due to financial reasons and getting caught of lying. She was born and grew up in Paris, she never had cancer, her sister never died. Her father died when she was 19, her mother a few years later. &lt;ref&gt;https://seura.fi/asiat/mysteeri/naparetkeilija-katosi-jaljettomiin-koko-elamantarina-huijausta/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dominick Arduin, Seikkailijan salaisuus'' (Revontuli 2004, {{ISBN|9789525170405}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''femininism''' (also capitalized as '''Femininism''') is related to the adjective [[feminine]]. The concept originates as far back as the 19th century. It is a philosophy of elevating and attempting to live by traits or virtues that accentuate the [[femininity]] of women, while still supporting intellectual equality between the sexes. It is acceptance of womanhood as strength.

Unlike the similar-sounding [[feminism]], ''femininism'' has a distinct meaning associated with gender differences rather than gender equality, though historically it has also been used to mean feminism.

Femininism is influenced by queer theory and disassociates female qualities from sex. It is a celebration of qualities typically considered female and supports the adoption of these qualities by both women and men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Athena doctrine :how women (and the men who think like them) will rule the future|last=Gerzema|first=John|last2=D'Antonio|first2=Michael|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=2013|isbn=9781118452950|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He came to the conclusion that "there exist in nature several bodily conformations in which the morphological characters of the male are associated in the same individual with those of the female."

They held to the motto of [[Erminia Fus Fusinato]], a poetess and the foundress of several educational institutions: "In my opinion the emancipation of woman means emancipation from want and ignorance." Page 830 "The Italian workwoman, thanks to her native cleverness and intelligence, might become a powerful ally for the cause of '''femininism'''. The leaders of the movement understand this, and lose no opportunity..." Page 831 "It is true that the "New Woman" in Italy is relatively prudent and abstains from vapouring against the marriage bond. It is also true that there are among the leaders of the movement some able individuals. But new ideas inevitably attract to themselves the discontented, the eccentric, the anarchic, those seeking an outlet. One of the apostles of French '''femininism''', M. Jules..."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;The Economic Dependence of Women by Vernon Lee from The North American Review, Vol. 175, No. 548 (Jul., 1902), pp. 71-90 (Page 72) "it does not quire the generalizing genius of Dr. Nordau, clapping Tolstoy and Ibsen into his specimen-box of "Degenerates," to tell us that the Woman Question, '''Femininism''', is likely to be taken up by those disconnected and disjointed personalities who are attracted by every other kind of thing in ''ism''; whose power consists of a little in their very inferiority; and whose abnormal and often morbid "pleasure in saying 'no'" (as [[Nietzsche]] puts it) is, after all, alas! so very necessary in this world of quite normally stupid and normally selfish and normally virtuous "pleasure in saying 'yes'"&lt;/ref&gt;

Teitaro Suzuki from The Monist, Vol. 18, No. 2 (APRIL, 1908), pp. 242-285 (Page 260) "The doctrine of [[Wu wei|Wu Wei]] is in its passivity the ethics of '''femininism'''. It teaches submissive humiliation, moderation, meekness, and often nonchalance; though, according to [[Lao-tze]], these things are not prized for their intrinsic virtue, but as the means of attaining the end of self-preservation or self-affirmation."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the feet stance|the Disney character|Goofy}}

'''Footedness''' is the natural preference of one's left or right [[foot]] for various purposes. It is the foot equivalent of [[handedness]]. While purposes vary, such as applying the greatest force in a certain foot to complete the action of kick as opposed to stomping, footedness is most commonly associated with the preference of a particular foot in the leading position while engaging in foot, or kicking related sports, such as [[association football]] and [[kickboxing]].

==In [[ball games]]==
In [[football]], the ball is predominately struck by the foot. Footedness may refer to the foot a player uses to kick with the greatest force and skill. Most people are right-footed, kicking with the right leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=BRW|volume=29|issue=28‚Äì29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hDK3AAAAIAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Business Review Weekly|page=26|quote=...a skilful left-footer (a rare trait in soccer), his services are sure to be in demand.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capable left-footed footballers are rare and therefore quite sought after. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brenner|first=David|title=Successful soccer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mmBohI1ee5gC|year=1990|publisher=Sackville|isbn=978-0-948615-31-3|page=40|quote=As a natural left-sided player, you'll already know how rare you are as a footballer ‚Äî and how valuable.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As rare are "two-footed" players, who are equally capable with both feet. Such players make up only one sixth of players in the top professional leagues in Europe.&lt;ref name=CEPDiscuss&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp0948.pdf | title=The Returns to Scarce Talent: Footedness and Player Remuneration in European Soccer | author=Bryson, Alex | journal=CEP Discussion Papers |date=September 2009  | volume=#948}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two-footedness can be learnt, a notable case being England international [[Tom Finney]], but can only be properly developed in the early years.&lt;ref name=CEPDiscuss/&gt; In [[Australian rules football|Australian Rules Football]], several players are equally adept at using both feet to kick the ball, such as [[Sam Mitchell (footballer)|Sam Mitchell]] and Charles Bushnell (footballer, retired).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/sam-mitchell-uses-his-non-preferred-foot-more-than-any-other-afl-footballer/story-e6frf3e3-1227393226605&lt;/ref&gt; In [[basketball]], a sport composed almost solely of right-handed players, it is common for most athletes to have a dominant left leg which they would use when jumping to complete a right-hand layup&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scholarsresearchlibrary.com/articles/performance-comparison-of-the-right-and-left-basketball-layup-in-hand-and-foot-ipsilateral-and-contralateral-conditions.pdf|title=Performance comparison of the right and left basketball lay-up in hand and foot ipsilateral and contralateral conditions|last=Aftabi|first=Gholam|date=2011|website=Scholar's Research Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hence, left handed basketball players tend to use their right leg more as they finish a left handed layup (although both right and left handed players are usually able to use both hands when finishing near the basket). 

In the [[National Football League]], a disproportionate, and increasing, number of [[punter (football)|punters]] punt with their left leg, where punting is the position in play that receives and kicks the ball once it leaves the line of scrimmage. At the end of the [[2017 NFL season]], 10 out of the league's 32 punters were left-footed, up from four out of 31 (not counting dual-footed punter [[Chris Hanson (American football)|Chris Hanson]], who left the league in 2009) at the beginning of the millennium; in contrast, [[placekicker]]s were almost exclusively right-footed. The only apparent advantage to punting with the left foot is because it is not as common, [[return specialist]]s are not as experienced handling the ball spinning in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/punting-takes-a-left-turn/ar-BBIfW9V?li=BBnb7Kz&amp;ocid=AARDHP|title=Punting Takes a Left Turn |first=Jenny|last=Vrentas|work=Sports Illustrated|date=January 11, 2018|accessdate=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In [[boardsport]]==
In boardsports, such as surfing, skateboarding and snowboarding, one must stand erect on a single, lightweight object that slides along the ground or on water. The need for balance causes one to position the body perpendicular to the direction of motion, with one foot leading the other. As with handedness, when this task is repetitively performed, one tends to naturally choose a particular foot for the leading position.

Boardsport riders are "footed" in one of two stances, generally called "regular" and "goofy". Riders will generally quickly choose a preferred stance that becomes permanently preferred. A "regular" stance indicates the left foot leading and a "Goofy" leads with the right. Professionals seem to be evenly distributed between the stances, as in the case of Luke Hopkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/edge/2015/11/12/tech-talk-boarding-onewheel-on-land-sport|title=Onewheel offering board riders a new on-land sport|work=SI.com|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practice can yield a high level of [[ambidexterity]] between the two stances, such that even seasoned participants of a boardsport have difficulty discerning the footedness of an unfamiliar rider in action.
 
To increase the difficulty, variety, and aesthetic value of tricks, riders can ride "switch stance" (abbreviated to "switch"). For example, a goofy-footed skateboarder normally performs an [[Ollie (skateboarding trick)|ollie]] with the right foot forward, but a "switch ollie" would have the rider standing with the left foot at the front of the board. In sports where switch riding is common and expected, like [[street skateboarding]], riders have the goal of appearing natural at, and performing the same tricks in, both regular and goofy stances. Some sports like [[kitesurfing]] and [[windsurfing]] generally require the rider to be able to switch stance depending on the wind or travel direction rather than rider preference. Each time direction is changed, the stance changes. Snowboarders who ride switch may adopt a "duck stance", where the feet are mounted turned out, or pointed away from the mid-line of the body, typically at a roughly 15 degree angle. In this position, the rider will have the leading foot facing forward in either regular or switch stance.

===Switch, Fakie and Nollie===
When a rider rolls backwards, this is called "riding [[fakie]]". A "fakie" trick is performed while riding backwards but taking off on the front foot. Although it is the same foot that jumps in one's traditional stance, it is normally the back foot. A rider can also land in the fakie position. While there are some parallels between switch stance and fakie, riding switch implies opening the shoulders more to face the direction headed, though not as much as in traditional stance, while fakie stance implies a slightly more backwards facing, closed shoulder posture. '[[Nollie]]' (nose ollie) is when the front foot takes off when one is riding in their normal stance, the same foot that jumps when doing tricks switch. In nollie position, the body and shoulders are facing forward as much as when riding in normal stance. Generally switch and nollie are done off the nose, whereas normal and fakie are done off the tail. 

In skateboarding, most tricks are performed riding backwards ‚Äî with respect to the rider's preferred stance ‚Äî are exclusively categorized as "switch" (in a switch stance) or as fakie, with the general rule that tricks off the [[List of skateboarding terms#Board parts|tail]] are almost always described as fakie, and those off the nose are nollie. For example, a jump using the tail rolling backwards is a "fakie [[Ollie (skateboarding)|ollie]]" (not a "switch nollie"), and a jump off the nose is a "nollie" (not a "fakie nollie").

====Mongo foot====
Mongo foot refers to the use of the rider's front foot for pushing. Normally, a skateboarder will feel more with comfortable using their back foot to push, while their front foot remains on the board. In the minority case of mongo-footed skateboarders, the opposite is true. Some skateboarders who don't push mongo in their regular stance may still push mongo when riding in switch stance, rather than push with their weaker back foot. Some well-known skaters who change between mongo and normal when pushing switch include Jacob Vance, [[Stevie Williams]], and [[Eric Koston]].

Although its origins remain uncertain, it is widely believed the term is a pejorative reference to the band [[Mungo Jerry|Mungo Jerry]].

==BMX==
In [[BMX]], there is a de facto relationship between footedness and preferences of grinding position and of mid-air turning direction. The terms "regular" and "goofy" do not indicate a foot preference as in boardsports, but rather they point out if the rider's footedness has the usual relationship with their grinding and mid-air turning preferences. For example, consider the following classes of riders:

* right-footed riders who prefer turning counter-clockwise in the air, and grinding on their right.
* left-footed riders who prefer turning clockwise in the air, and grinding on their left.

Both classes are of equal size and would be considered "regular". "Goofy" would describe riders whose trick preferences do not match their footedness: a rider who prefers to grind on the opposite side as do most is considered a "goofy grinder"; one who prefers to turn the opposite direction in mid-air as do most is considered a "goofy spinner". Few riders have either goofy trait, but some riders may have both. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://whitelines.com/archive/features/goofy-vs-regular-an-infographic.html|title=Goofy vs. Regular - The Infographic - Whitelines Snowboarding|work=Whitelines Snowboarding|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kickboxing, professional wrestling and MMA==
In many combat sports, most people have a more powerful kick with the same side as their handedness.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3353">'''Infomax''' is an optimization principle for [[artificial neural networks]] and other information processing systems.  It prescribes that a function that maps a set of input values ''I'' to a set of output values ''O'' should be chosen or learned so as to maximize the average [[Claude Shannon|Shannon]] [[mutual information]] between ''I'' and ''O'', subject to a set of specified constraints and/or noise processes.  Infomax algorithms are learning [[algorithms]] that perform this optimization process. The principle was described by Linsker in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/2.36 |author=Linsker R |title=Self-organization in a perceptual network |journal=IEEE Computer |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=105‚Äì17 |year=1988  |url=http://www.kovan.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~erol/Courses/CENG569/papers%20for%20presentation/linsker-88.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infomax, in its zero-noise limit, is related to the principle of redundancy reduction proposed for biological sensory processing by [[Horace Barlow]] in 1961,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Barlow, H. |chapter=Possible principles underlying the transformations of sensory messages |editor=Rosenblith, W. |title=Sensory Communication |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge MA |year=1961 |pages=217‚Äì234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and applied quantitatively to retinal processing by Atick and Redlich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/neco.1992.4.2.196 |author=Atick JJ, Redlich AN |title=What does the retina know about natural scenes? |journal=Neural Computation |volume=4 |pages=196‚Äì210 |year=1992 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the applications of infomax has been to an [[independent component analysis]] [[algorithm]] that finds independent signals by maximizing [[entropy]].  Infomax-based ICA was described by Bell and Sejnowski, and Nadal and Parga in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/neco.1995.7.6.1129 |author=Bell AJ, Sejnowski TJ |title=An information-maximization approach to blind separation and blind deconvolution |journal=Neural Comput |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=1129‚Äì59 |date=November 1995 |pmid=7584893 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nadal J.P., Parga N. |title= Sensory coding: information maximization and redundancy reduction |journal=Neural information processing, G.

'''Jason Kemper Sears''' (23 January 1968 ‚Äì 31 January 2006) was an [[United States|American]] [[punk rock]] [[vocalist]] from Santa Barbara, California, best known for his work with [[Rich Kids on LSD]] (RKL), from 1982 to their first breakup in 1990 and again from 1993 to 2006. He was also a nationally ranked snowboarder at one time and sponsored by Barfoot [[snowboarding]] team.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitty (November 13, 2002).  [http://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/music-interviews/rkl/ Between that and the drugs...I mean cut through the crap, it was the drugs] ''[[Thrasher Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Sears was one of many singers to contribute to the album ''[[Strait Up]]'', made in memory of [[Lynn Strait]], the late lead singer of the band [[Snot (band)|Snot]]. Sears provided vocals for the track "Until Next Time".&lt;ref name=cmj2000&gt;{{cite journal |last=Richards |first=Sean |title=Reviews |journal=CMJ New Music Monthly |volume=70 |date=December 2000 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Sears died in a detoxification clinic in [[Tijuana]], Mexico, of pulmonary [[thrombosis]] unrelated to the treatment. According to Mexican authorities he had been suffering from serious skin abscesses and an infection. He was being treated for addiction with [[ibogaine]], a psychoactive compound with anti-addictive properties that is illegal in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Cearley, Anna (February 3, 2006).

Sears is remembered by [[NOFX]] in the song ''Doornails'' from the 2006 album ''[[Wolves in Wolves' Clothing]]'', a tribute to punk rock musicians from Southern California who have died. The Sears reference is in the line, "This Patr√≥n's for Jason."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metrolyrics.com/door-nails-lyrics-nofx.html Full lyrics of this song] at [[MetroLyrics]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jo√£o Teixeira de Faria''' (born June 24, 1942), known also as '''Jo√£o de Deus''', is a Brazilian [[medium (spirituality)|medium]] and "[[psychic surgery|psychic surgeon]]" who has been accused of being a [[confidence trick]]ster.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.9news.com.au/national/2014/10/27/07/00/controversial-brazilian-spiritual-healer-john-of-god-set-to-visit-sydney-next-month&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/good-weekend/john-of-god-miracle-worker-or-charlatan-20141002-10jl7q.html&lt;/ref&gt; He is based in [[Abadi√¢nia]], [[Brazil]], where he runs the Casa de Dom In√°cio de Loyola, a "spiritual healing center".

==Biography==

===Early life===
Jo√£o Teixeira de Faria was born in Cachoeira da Fuma√ßa, [[Goi√°s]] (now [[Cachoeira de Goi√°s]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://biblioteca.ibge.gov.br/visualizacao/dtbs/goias/cachoeiradegoias.pdf |title=Cachoeira de Goi√°s: History |work=IBGE: Biblioteca |year=2015 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |language=Portuguese }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Faria has no medical training and describes himself as a "simple farmer".&lt;ref name="belief"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.beliefnet.com/News/Science-Religion/2002/11/John-Of-God-Investigating-A-Brazilian-Faith-Healer.aspx |title=Faith Healer John of God |first=John  |last=Qui√±ones |work=Beliefnet.com |year=2015 |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed two years of education and spent a number of years travelling from village to village in the states of Goi√°s and [[Minas Gerais]].

===Abadi√¢nia===
Faria says he was told by his spirit guides that he must expand his work to reach more people and [[Spiritism|spiritist]] medium [[Chico Xavier]] told him he should go to the small Goi√°s town of Abadi√¢nia to fulfill his healing mission. Around 1978, when Jo√£o first performed healings there, he just sat outdoors in a chair near the main road where people began to arrive seeking cures for their various illnesses and conditions. Gradually the numbers increased to thousands per day and he developed his centre, Casa de Dom In√°cio de Loyola.&lt;ref name="johnofgodhealing.com"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.johnofgodhealing.com/casa.htm |title=Casa de Dom In√°cio de Loyola |work=johnofgodhealing.com |year=2015 |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Casa de Dom In√°cio de Loyola has since been visited by millions of people seeking healing. He also owns a nearby cattle ranch, which covers about 1,000 acres and is valued over 2 million reais.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Primetime/story?id=939529&amp;page=1&amp;singlePage=true |title=Is 'John of God' a Healer or a Charlatan? |work=[[ABC News]] |date=14 July 2005 |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="translate.google.com"&gt;https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fvejabrasilia.abril.com.br%2Fmateria%2Fgente%2Fjoao-do-ceu-e-da-terra%2F&amp;sandbox=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of his income comes from selling passionflower preparations, the single herb prescribed by Faria to cure a variety of ailments. The company which bears Jo√£o Teixeira Faria's initials, JTF Ltda., markets the drug and is registered in the name of his wife, Ana Keyla Teixeira, and his driver and employee Abadio da Cruz.&lt;ref name="translate.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=pt&amp;u=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/cotidiano/38796-joao-de-deus-sa.shtml&amp;prev=search&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Faria was diagnosed with an aggressive stomach cancer. In August, 2015 a doctor of conventional medicine, Raul Cutait, extracted a malignant tumor of 6&amp;nbsp;cm - a [[gastric adenocarcinoma]]. The surgery and follow up of 5 months of [[chemotherapy]] took place at the [[Syrian-Lebanese Hospital]] in S√£o Paulo.&lt;ref&gt;https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.paulopes.com.br%2F2016%2F07%2Fmedicina-salva-o-curandeiro-joao-de-um-cancer.html%23.V_65cuArLIU&amp;edit-text=&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/the-right-chemistry-brazilian-healer-john-of-god-leads-cancer-patients-by-the-nose&lt;/ref&gt; Faria did not report these facts to the public originally saying he was being hospitalised for a stomach hernia.&lt;ref&gt;https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=pt&amp;u=http://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/app/noticia/cidades/2015/09/11/interna_cidadesdf,498180/medium-joao-de-deus-e-operado-em-sao-paulo-apos-problemas-no-intestin.shtml&amp;prev=search&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims of spiritual healing powers==
[[Image:Joao teixeira 1.jpg|thumb|300px|Jo√£o on stage after performing a "psychic surgery"]]
Faria regularly prescribes meditation and walks to a nearby waterfall as part of treatment. The Casa also sells herbs, blessed items and artefacts such as magic triangles. It was estimated by [[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes Australia]] in 2014 that these sales earn Faria over $10 million per year.&lt;ref name="9Jumpin"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.9jumpin.com.au/show/60minutes/stories/2014/october/john-of-god/ |title=60 Minutes: John of God |first=Michael |last=Usher |work=9jumpin.com.au |date=26 October 2014 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |quote=Usher revealed that ...'Meeting John [de] Faria is free, but he often prescribes visits to these crystal beds. At $25 a session, they earn him around $1.8 million a year. Then there‚Äôs the blessed water, a dollar a bottle. There‚Äôs a gift shop and next door to that, a pharmacy. It sells one thing: blessed herbal pills, only available by a John of God prescription apparently. They‚Äôre $25 a bottle and would make Mr. de Faria about $40,000 a day. That‚Äôs more than $14 million a year.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When called for a [[Psychic surgery|spiritual surgery]] by Faria, patients are offered the choice of 'visible' or 'invisible' operations. If they select an 'invisible' operation (or are younger than 18 or older than 52) they are directed to sit in a room and meditate. Faria says that spiritual physicians can perform surgery on the actual patient via a surrogate when the actual patient is unable to make the trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.friendsofthecasa.info/index.php?page=intervention |title=Intervention |work=The Friends of the Casa de Dom Inacio Abadiania Brazil |year=2015 |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very small percentage of people choose a 'visible' operation where Faria operates without traditional anesthetic. Instead he says he uses "energized" mineral water and the spiritual energies present, the latter which are provided by groups of volunteers who meditate in a separate room called the 'current room'. These practices such as inserting scissors or forceps deep into a nose and scraping an eye without an anesthetic or antiseptics have been scrutinised by medical authorities and skeptical investigators such as [[James Randi]], who has called for Faria to stop victimizing people with stunts and trickery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://web.randi.org/home/from-the-archives-randis-inside-scoop-into-abc-news-john-of-god-investigation-2005 |title=From the Archives: Randi's inside scoop into ABC News' 'John of God' investigation (2005) |work=James Randi Educational Foundation |date=6 October 2014  |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Nickell]] has described these procedures as old carnival tricks.&lt;ref name="csicop.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.csicop.org/si/show/john_of_god_healings_by_entities/ |title=‚ÄòJohn of God‚Äô: Healings by Entities?  |first=Joe |last=Nickell |work=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |date=October 2007 |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faria tells people not to stop taking their medicine and says not everyone he serves will be cured. Often the treatment includes capsules containing pure [[passion flower]] that he says carry special blessed spiritual energy to support the individual's healing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://pr.b5z.net/i/u/10059842/i/A_guide_to_the_Casa_de_Dom_Inacio_V2.3.pdf |title=Guide for English Speaking Visitors |work=Casa de Dom In√°cio |year=2009 |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faria has undergone trials and scrutiny of his work. He has been arrested several times for practicing medicine without a licence and has been jailed once.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

==Live events outside Brazil==

Faria has travelled to other countries to perform healing ceremonies called Live Events. [[Gail Harris|Gail Thackray]], Casa Medium said in her book ''Spiritual Journeys: Visiting John of God'' that the main entities that incorporate in Brazil are the same ones at Live Events, along with thousands of other entities  doing healing work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gailthackray.com/#!The-Spirits-of-John-of-God/c1srj/E02455AB-25ED-46F7-921A-14720A853F11|title=The Spirits of John of God |first=Gail |last=Thackray |work=gailthackray.com |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://johnofgodlive.com/about-events/ |title=About Events |work=johnofgodlive.com |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the medical laws around the world, blessed water instead of the herbs is prescribed. It is available for about $3 a bottle. Everyone who receives a spiritual intervention must drink this blessed water.&lt;ref name="johnofgodlive.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://johnofgodlive.com/live/faq/ |title=F.A.Q. |work=johnofgodlive.com |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
===ABC news report===
On July 14, 2005, the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) ran a news report about Faria on ''[[Primetime (U.S. TV program)|Primetime Live]]''.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; The programme featured five people with various medical conditions, including [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[Lou Gehrig's disease]] and an inoperable brain tumour. Each patient saw Faria and ABC claimed that in three of the cases there had been an improvement.  A young female athlete who had been paraplegic was shown beginning to move her legs.

ABC's update on the five subjects,&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; while not mentioning subject Mary Hendrickson, indicated that one subject is making either slow progress or none at all, two are worse, and one shows improvement. Subject David Ames died from complications July 16, 2008.&lt;ref name="Death"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sfgate/obituary.aspx?pid=117040324 |title=David Ames Obituary |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=7 September 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; And despite undergoing Faria's psychic surgery and being declared cured, Lisa Melman's breast cancer got progressively worse. She stated the tumor had grown and became painful. She continued to suffer and died in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Melman Obit, March 2012  http://www.sajr.co.za/docs/default-source/pdf/2012/2012-03/16-march-2012.pdf?sfvrsn=2&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptic [[James Randi]] spent about an hour in New York being interviewed and taped for the report. James Randi later critiqued ABC for having cherry-picked his comments to show more credibility for the 'faith-healer' than justified. Randi went on to have given scientific explanations for all the activities observed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.randi.org/jr/021805a.html&lt;/ref&gt; Randi revealed the natural explanations for activities ranging from putting forceps in the nose, random cutting of the flesh, 'scraping' of the eyeball, the subsequent absence of infection, and other activities one by one as age old parlor tricks. However, he was dismayed that none of his critical comments were shown in the final segment. This was cut down to under 20 seconds of screen time.&lt;ref name="skepdic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/johnofgod.html|title=John of God |work=The Skeptic's Dictionary |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Oprah Winfrey Show''===

'''2010 Show 'Leap of Faith: Meet John of God'''

On November 17, 2010, Susan Casey wrote in ''[[O: The Oprah Magazine|O Magazine]]'' about her trip to see Faria in Brazil and was subsequently covered on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. The article was entitled "Leap of Faith: Meet John of God". The show was entitled "Do You Believe in Miracles?". In both, she discusses her need to deal with the traumatic loss of her father. After he suddenly died in 2008, Casey experienced a "tsunami of grief" that she says she couldn't escape from. She wondered if Faria could help heal her grief. She met him twice and later stated, "Three hours went by like 20 minutes, and it was blissful--it was like I was floating." Casey claims she was able to speak with her dead father. "It was very real," she says. "More of a vision than I had ever had before. ... I got this feeling like I shouldn't be sad, that everything was okay."

While Casey stated that the whole experience sounds unusual, she claimed that she is "not a woo-woo person" and that Faria helped her find healing. Casey stated that she was a neutral observer.&lt;ref name="O Magazine Leap of Faith: Meet John of God"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/spirit/Spiritual-Healer-John-of-God-Susan-Casey |title= Leap of Faith: Meet John of God |date=November 17, 2010 |publisher=Oprah.com |accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Rediger, a psychiatrist from Harvard Medical School in Boston, was provided as a skeptic.&lt;ref name="The Initiative for Spiritual Development"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.drrediger.com/ |title=the center for psychological and spiritual development |work=drrediger.com |date=December 10, 2010 |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rediger was astonished to discover bleeding from his torso after "invisible" surgery.  The show did not provide scientific or medical explanations for the procedures performed.  There is no established medical or scientific reasoning for these procedures.&lt;ref name="How Low Can Oprah Go?"&gt;{{cite web | title=How Low Can Oprah Go? |url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=8349 |publisher=ScienceBasedMedicine.org |date=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In depth critical investigative reports followed this broadcast.&lt;ref name="skepdic.com"/&gt;

'''2013 Oprah's Next Chapter: 'John of God'

On March 17, 2013, ''[[Oprah's Next Chapter]]'', Season 2, Episode 116, aired a televised show entitled [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MenNIoHiO5Y 'John of God']. Oprah traveled to Brazil to meet and talk with Faria, and see his unexplained miracles firsthand. She also interviewed Magnus Kemppii, from Sweden, about his 'surgery' and five Americans who hope to be cured from their ailments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/own-oprahs-next-chapter/Oprahs-Next-Chapter-John-of-God |title=Oprah's Next Chapter: John of God |work=Oprah.com |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/19/john-of-god-oprah-faith-healer-spiritual-surgery_n_2903520.html |title=John Of God: Oprah Says Faith Healer's Surgeries Almost Made Her Faint (VIDEO) |work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 60 Minutes Australia===

Faria's first visit to Australia and a 'Live Event' scheduled November 22‚Äì24, 2014 at the  [[Sydney Showground (Olympic Park)|Sydney Showground]] in Sydney Olympic Park garnered much media attention.&lt;ref name="theaustralian"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/critics-show-little-faith-in-healing-powers-of-brazilian-trickster/story-e6frg6so-1227079512656?nk=6c276b34c89886bfcac5dbfc8aa5b704 |first=Ean |last=Higgins |title=Critics show little faith in healing powers of Brazilian 'trickster' |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=4 October 2014 |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/controversial-brazilian-faith-healer-john-of-god-visits-sydney-20141122-11rrty.html |title=Controversial Brazilian faith healer John of God visits Sydney |first=Julie |last=Power |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=23 November 2014 |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After visiting Faria at his "Casa" in Abadi√¢nia, Brazil, the [[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|Australian 60 Minutes]] television program aired a critical investigative report on 25 October 2014, examining Faria's healing treatment practices,  the amount of money being made and raising questions about sexual assault allegations against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.9jumpin.com.au/show/60minutes/extraminutes/3859303292001/ |title=Reporter Interview with Michael Usher |first=Michael |last=Usher |work=9jumpin.com.au |year=2015 |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-part program hosted by reporter [[Michael Usher]] was a follow-up to [[Liz Hayes]]' 1998 investigation of Faria.&lt;ref name="O Magazine Leap of Faith: Meet John of God"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.9jumpin.com.au/show/60minutes/extraminutes/3859303296001/ |title=Rewind: John Of God - 1998 |work=9jumpin |year=2015 |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://web.randi.org/swift/no-healing-miracles-found-in-john-of-god-follow-up-investigation |title=No Healing Miracles Found in ‚ÄòJohn of God‚Äô Follow-Up Investigation |first=William M. |last=London |work=James Randi Educational Foundation |date=3 November 2014 |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Part 1 of the follow-up, reporter Michael Usher revealed that a woman declared as cured of breast cancer by a spirit entity channeled by Faria died in 2003. A woman in a wheelchair with multiple sclerosis, who in the 1998 report said she visited Faria with the expectation of walking again, didn‚Äôt feel any effect, is still in a wheelchair, and her condition deteriorated. Her trip to the Casa cost $5,000. Usher reported that none of the other people (forty Australians) who made the pilgrimage that Hayes joined for investigation improved.&lt;ref&gt;Part I video 60 Minutes: John of God&lt;/ref&gt;

Usher‚Äôs report mentioned that some of the thousands in Faria's audience hope to receive ‚Äú[[Psychic surgery|spiritual surgery]]‚Äù from him. In an extended interview, Emergency medicine specialist Dr. David Rosengren personally examined and reported these practices as horrendous and barbaric, stating:  ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the modern medical world could not condone this behavior in any way whatsoever‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.9jumpin.com.au/show/60minutes/extraminutes/3859303294001/ |title=Extended Interview with Dr. David Rosengren |work=9Jumpin |year=2015 |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prospect of Faria coming to Australia had also alarmed the [[Australian Medical Association]], reported Ean Higgins, in a 4 October 2014  article in ''[[The Australian]]'': ‚ÄúI am extremely sceptical about this person [Mr Faria]; I can find it hard to see any motivation apart from personal profit for him and his organisation,‚Äù AMA vice president Stephen Parnis said. ‚ÄúIf he undertakes any of these surgical procedures they should be reported to the health complaints commission ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2807437/Meet-spiritual-healer-Brazil-claims-cured-millions-people-including-Oprah-Winfrey-hes-coming-Australia.html |title=Meet John Of God who claims to have cured millions including Oprah Winfrey |first=Nelson |last=Groom |work=Daily Mail Australia |date=25 October 2014 |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Part 2 of his report, Usher stated that there were two deaths in recent years at the Casa that warranted investigations, but no one was charged. He also reported that in 2010, when Faria visited Sedona, Arizona, the police department investigated him because a woman said he took her hands and placed them on his genitals; Faria also tried to pull down her skirt. The case never went to court; one of his associates encouraged the woman to drop the allegations.&lt;ref name="9Jumpin"/&gt;

The Catholic Church, through its representative Rev. Brian Lucas, issued an televised verbal warning,  stating "John of God doesn't have any official affiliation with the Catholic Church". He cautioned all to be very skeptical of people seeking publicity with claims of miracles and faith healing, more so when there is a lot of money involved.&lt;ref name="9Jumpin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/good-weekend/john-of-god-miracle-worker-or-charlatan-20141003-10jl7q.html |title=John of God: Miracle worker or charlatan? |first=Tim |last=Elliott |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=4 October 2014 |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 Montreal Gazette===
On July 22, 2016, The [[Montreal Gazette]] published a report on John of  God, "Brazilian 'healer' John of God leads cancer patients by the nose", by columnist Dr [[Joe Schwarcz]], accompanied by a video report from 'Dr Joe's' The Right Chemistry series.
Schwarcz is an author and a professor at [[McGill University]] in Montreal, Quebec. He is the director of McGill's Office for Science &amp; Society, which is dedicated to demystifying science for the public.
The report starts by detailing Faria's life history as a medium and psychic surgeon. It then examines his practice and supposed treatments, such as the 'Up Your Nose' surgery to treat cancers. The report criticised this as quackery highlighting the resulting death of Lisa Melman. 
Schwarcz also criticised Faria's choices of treatment for his own health problems.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTZqZnKHbq0&amp;t=53s&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen''' (LAPSS) is a method of identifying potential [[stroke]] patients in a pre-hospital setting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/34/1/71.full American Heart Association - Stroke]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screening Criteria==

* Over 45 years old
* No history of seizures
* Neurologic symptoms started to present within the last 24 hours
* Patient is not hospitalized
* Blood sugar is 60 - 400 mg/dL
* Unilateral (and not bilateral) exhibition of Facial Droop, Grip weakness, Arm weakness or other observable motor asymmetries
If '''all''' of these criteria are met (or not ascertainable) the LAPSS is positive for stroke. Patients may still be experiencing a stroke even if LAPSS criteria are not met.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strokecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAPSS.pdf LAPSS Protocol]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Validity==
A January 2000 study, conducted by 3 teams of [[Los Angeles]]-based [[paramedic]] units resulted in "sensitivity of 91% (95% CI, 76% to 98%), specificity of 97% (95% CI, 93% to 99%), positive predictive value of 86% (95% CI, 70% to 95%), and negative predictive value of 98% (95% CI, 95% to 99%). With correction for the 4 documentation errors, positive predictive value increased to 97% (95% CI, 84% to 99%)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Identifying stroke in the field.

In a Chinese study, [[Beijing]] paramedics using the protocol, completed LAPSS screenings in an average of 4.3¬±3.0 minutes (median, 5 minutes). The study resulted in a sensitivity of 78.44% and a specificity of 90.22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Validation of the Los Angeles pre-hospital stroke screen (LAPSS) in a Chinese urban emergency medical service population. | date=2013-08-07 | pmid=23950994 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0070742 | volume=8 | pmc=3737357 | journal=PLoS One | pages=e70742 | last1 = Chen | first1 = S | last2 = Sun | first2 = H | last3 = Lei | first3 = Y | last4 = Gao | first4 = D | last5 = Wang | first5 = Y | last6 = Wang | first6 = Y | last7 = Zhou | first7 = Y | last8 = Wang | first8 = A | last9 = Wang | first9 = W | last10 = Zhao | first10 = X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luz Chavita''' (1880‚Äì?) was the stage name of '''Luisa Lacalle''', a Spanish dancer who gained international fame during the [[Belle √âpoque]] and was a leading dancer in Paris before returning to Spain to become an entrepreneur.

==Biography==
Luisa Lacalle was born in 1880 in [[Jerez de la Frontera]], Spain to a poor family originally from Seville. Showing promise for dancing at an early age, she began taking dancing classes with [[Juana la Macarrona]]. By the time she was fourteen, Lacalle was dancing professionally using the artistic name Lulu or Luz Chavita.{{sfn|Jim√©nez Garc√≠a|2016}} Having gained a reputation for her talent, she moved to Paris with a letter for introduction for the Count de Pradere (also known as [[Carballo (name)#Carballo family|Daniel de Carbalho y de Prat]]). Pradere introduced her to Antonin Perivier and {{ill|Fernand de Rodays|fr}}, the directors of the newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]''. The pair frequently gave entertainments for aristocratic subscribers and invited Chavita to appear. Almost overnight, she became a sensation and was proclaimed as a new star.{{sfn|Jim√©nez Garc√≠a|2016}}

Before her official debut, Chavita studied with [[Mariquita (dancer)|Madame Mariquita]], where she studied for the next two years.{{sfn|Jim√©nez Garc√≠a|2016}} Soon after, she had her official debut at [[La Scala]] and from there she went to the [[Folies Berg√®re]], where she was hired along with Juanita de Frezia, La Belle Gerrero, and Mlle Hernandez, to dance their Spanish repertoire which showed off their [[d√©colletage]] and bare legs.{{sfn|Jim√©nez Garc√≠a|2016}}{{sfn|Gutsche-Miller|2015|p=17}} She toured Europe, visiting [[Berlin]], [[Budapest]], London, [[Vienna]] and other major cities and then was engaged at El Alc√°zar in [[Marseilles]].{{sfn|Jim√©nez Garc√≠a|2016}} By 1898, she was among the soloists performing at the [[Op√©ra-Comique|Ballet de l'Op√©ra Comique]] along with such dancers as {{ill|R√©gina Badet|fr}}, {{ill|A√Øda Boni|fr}}, [[Jeanne Chasles]], [[Cl√©o de M√©rode]] and [[Stacia Napierkowska]]. The theater soon earned the reputation as the "most artistic of Paris".{{sfn|''Bulletin D‚Äôinformation du Centre Chor√©graphique National''|2007|p=6}}

[[File:Luz Chavita, by Reutlinger.jpg|thumb|Luz Chavita by Reutlinger]]
At another of ''[[Le Figaro]]''‚Ä≤s entertainments in 1899, Chavita enhanced her fame even more. The newspaper had sided with [[Alfred Dreyfus]] and agreed to publish documents which would impact the government handling of the [[Dreyfus affair]]. The police planned a raid to confiscate the documents, but when they arrived, Chavita began her performance, delaying the search until the documents could be safely hidden.{{sfn|Jim√©nez Garc√≠a|2016}} The story was retold in newspapers ranging from Madrid to the United States.{{sfn|Jim√©nez|2016}}{{sfn|''El Adelanto''|1899}}{{sfn|''The Evening Gazette''|1899|p=2}} Other noted performances at the Op√©ra-Comique were her portrayal of ''[[Carmen]]'' in 1901 and in ''la Danse au temps de Gavarni'' (The Dance in the Time of Gavarni) in 1903 in which her polka was called exquisite.{{sfn|''La Corespondencia de Espa√±a''|1901|p=2}}{{sfn|''Le Figaro''|1903}}

Chavita saved all of her earnings, investing them carefully, and announced her retirement from the stage in 1905. She reconfirmed she was leaving Paris in 1908 and returned to Seville, where she bought real estate on Santa Clara Street, and later another house on Goyonetta Street. She outfitted her homes with modern refinements from Paris, took care of her parents in their old age, and purchased a vineyard in Jerez, which she administered for many years.{{sfn|Jim√©nez Garc√≠a|2016}}{{sfn||Andalusian Patrimony &amp; History|2015}}{{sfn|Cavestany|1908}}

==Death and legacy==
Chavita's death date is unknown.{{sfn|Jim√©nez Garc√≠a|2016}} In 1905, the ceiling of Paillard Restaurant of Paris, where aristocrats and royalty gathered to dine was painted with a tribute called ''Women of the Twentieth Century'' by [[Lucien-Victor Guirand de Sc√©vola]]. Chavita's was one of the likenesses that was included.{{sfn|Wassenaar|2015}}

'''Lying in state''' is the tradition in which the body of a dead [[official]] is placed in a state building, either outside or inside a [[coffin]], to allow the public to pay their respects. It traditionally takes place in the principal government building of a country, state, or city. While the practice differs among countries, a viewing in a location other than the principal government building may be referred to as [[lying in repose]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdw.army.mil/reagan/General/lying_in_state.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611215010/http://www.mdw.army.mil/reagan/General/lying_in_state.html |date=June 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
In [[Canada]], official lying in state is a part of a [[state funeral]], an honor generally reserved for former [[Governor General of Canada|Governors General]] and former [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Ministers]]. It is held in the [[Centre Block]] of [[Parliament Hill]], in the national capital, [[Ottawa]], Ontario. Ex-governors general lie in state in the [[Senate of Canada|Senate Chamber]] while former prime ministers lie in the Hall of Honour. During the period of lying in state, the coffins are flanked at each corner by a [[Guard of honour]], made up of four members drawn from the [[Canadian Forces]] and [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], as well as members of the [[Governor General's Foot Guards]] for former governors general, and guards from the parliamentary security forces for former prime ministers. Guards stand at each corner with heads bowed and weapons inverted (resting on Arms reversed) with their backs turned towards the casket.

Provinces may also mount state funerals and have a lying in state for a distinguished former resident. For instance, [[Maurice Richard]], nationally known hockey player, was given a state funeral by the province of [[Quebec]] when he died in 2000; his coffin lay in state at the [[Bell Centre|Molson Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2000/05/28/rocketfuneral000528.html | work=CBC News | title=Rocket to get state funeral | date=May 28, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process was repeated for fellow [[Canadiens]] legend [[Jean B√©liveau]] in December 2014.

Municipalities may offer civic funerals to prominent deceased current or former politicians.

==North Korea==
In [[North Korea]], the body of the late leader [[Kim Jong-il]] was displayed in a glass coffin surrounded with red flowers at the [[Kumsusan Palace of the Sun|Kumsusan Memorial Palace]] in [[Pyongyang]] prior to his funeral, which began and ended at the palace. An honor guard armed with AK-47s was present. Jong-il's father [[Kim Il-sung]], the founding president, is on display elsewhere in the palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kim's body on show in North Korea amid mass mourning |url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/world/12403169/kim-s-body-on-show-in-n-korea-amid-mass-mourning/ |work=AFP |publisher=The West Australian |accessdate=3 January 2012 |authorlink=Kim's body on show in North Korea amid mass mourning |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64P6ngzMi?url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/world/12403169/kim-s-body-on-show-in-n-korea-amid-mass-mourning/ |archivedate=3 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russia==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
In [[Russia]], during the time of the [[Soviet Union]] (1917‚Äì1991), the [[state funeral]]s of the most senior political and military leaders, such as [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Leonid Brezhnev]], [[Yuri Andropov]], and [[Konstantin Chernenko]] all followed the same basic outline. They took place in Moscow, beginning with a public lying in state of the deceased in the [[House of the Unions]], and ending with an interment at [[Red Square]].

For the lying in state at the [[House of the Unions]], the coffin would be placed on display in the Column Hall, which would be decorated by flowers, numerous [[red flag (politics)|red flags]] and other [[communist symbolism|communist symbols]]. The mourners, which usually would be brought in by the thousands, shuffled up a marble staircase beneath chandeliers draped in black gauze. On the stage at the left side of the Column Hall, a full orchestra in black tailcoats played classical music. The deceased's [[embalmed]] body, dressed in a black suit, white shirt and a tie, was displayed in an open coffin on a [[catafalque]] banked with carnations, red roses and tulips, facing the queue of mourners. A small [[guard of honour]] would be in attendance in the background. At the right side of the hall, seats were placed for guests of honour, with the front row reserved for the dead leader's family.

On the day of the funeral, a military funeral parade would take place during which the coffin would be conveyed from the House of the Unions to Red Square where burial would take place. Lenin and Stalin were placed inside the [[Lenin Mausoleum]], while Brezhnev, Andropov, and Chernenko were interred in individual graves in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]].

==Singapore==
At [[state funeral]]s in [[Singapore]], the national flag is put on the coffin. The vigil guard may be deployed during the public lying in state of the deceased person at [[Parliament House, Singapore|Parliament House]]. The deployment of the vigil guard is the highest form of respect accorded by the nation to the deceased. Similar to British traditions, the vigil guard is composed of groups of five [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]]s from the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) and [[Singapore Police Force]] (SPF) who stand guard around the clock in shifts of 30 minutes. One of the five officers stands facing outward at each of the four corners of the casket, while the fifth and most senior one stands in front and faces inward. Their heads are bowed and their ceremonial swords are inverted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cheong|first1=Danson|title='An honour to stand vigil for Mr Lee Kuan Yew'|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/an-honour-to-stand-vigil-for-mr-lee-kuan-yew|agency=The Straits Times|accessdate=21 March 2016|date=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vigil guards were stationed at the public lying in state of [[Goh Keng Swee]] in May 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Of state funerals and state-assisted funerals|url=http://publicopinion.sg/242/of-state-funerals-and-state-assisted-funerals|agency=Public Opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lee Kuan Yew]] in March 2015 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vigil guard, highest form of respect, accorded to Lee Kuan Yew during lying in state|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/vigil-guard-highest-form/1739864.html|agency=Channel News Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[S R Nathan]] in August 2016.

==South Africa==
{{See also|state funeral}}
[[Nelson Mandela]] was the first democratically elected president to lie in state in [[South Africa]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The event took place at the [[Union Buildings]], the same site where he was inaugurated as the [[President of South Africa]] on May 10, 1994. The body of Mandela was lying in State for three days, starting on Wednesday, December 11, 2013 and ending Friday, December 13. The body was viewed by thousands of South Africans before it was airlifted to [[Qunu]] in the Eastern Cape where Mandela was buried on December 15, 2013.

==United Kingdom==
{{see also|State funerals in the United Kingdom|Vigil of the Princes}}

In [[State funeral|state and ceremonial]] funerals in the [[United Kingdom]], the lying-in-state takes place in [[Westminster Hall]]. The coffin is placed on a [[catafalque]] and is guarded, around the clock, by detachments, each of four men, from the following units:
* [[Sovereign's Bodyguard]]
** [[Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms|Her Majesty's Bodyguard of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms]]
** [[Yeomen of the Guard|The Queen's Bodyguard of the Yeomen of the Guard]]
** [[Royal Company of Archers|The Royal Company of Archers, The Queen's Bodyguard for Scotland]]
* [[Household Cavalry]]
** [[Life Guards (Britain)|The Life Guards]]
** [[The Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons)]]
* [[Foot Guards]]
** [[Grenadier Guards]]
** [[Coldstream Guards]]
** [[Scots Guards]]
** [[Irish Guards]]
** [[Welsh Guards]]

Each unit mans the guard for a total of six hours, with each detachment standing post for twenty minutes. The four men stand at each corner with heads bowed and weapons inverted; their backs are turned towards the coffin.

On two occasions, the [[Vigil of the Princes|guard]] has been mounted by four male members of the [[Royal Family]]. At the lying in state of [[George V|King George V]] in 1936, the guard was mounted by his four sons [[Edward VIII|King Edward VIII]], the [[George VI|Duke of York]] (George VI), the [[Henry, Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]] and the [[George, Duke of Kent|Duke of Kent]]. For [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]]'s lying-in-state in 2002, the guard was mounted by her four grandsons, the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]], the [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Duke of York]], the [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Earl of Wessex]], and [[David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley|Viscount Linley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/clips/ram-newsworld/qmum_vigil020408.ram] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QjUz5p50?url=http://www.cbc.ca/clips/ram-newsworld/qmum_vigil020408.ram |date=July 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lying in state in the [[United States]] is the rare honor either authorized by a congressional resolution or approved by the congressional leadership, when permission is granted by survivors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aoc.gov/nations-stage/lying-state-honor |title= "Lying in State or in Honor" |publisher=US Architect of the Capitol (AOC) |accessdate=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, to a deceased official whereby his or her remains are placed in the [[United States Capitol rotunda|rotunda]] of the [[United States Capitol]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] for public viewing. The casket is guarded by members of the [[United States armed forces|armed forces]]. By regulation and custom, only [[President of the United States|Presidents]], military commanders, and [[Member of Congress|members of Congress]] are granted the honor of lying in state. Except for Presidents and former Presidents, the honor is not automatic. Not all those entitled to the honor have it accepted by their survivors. The first leader to receive this honor was [[Henry Clay]], former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]], when he died in 1852. Since then, the honor has been extended to 31 people, including eleven Presidents, and to 4 Unknown Soldiers, representing U.S. service members who have died without their remains being identified. An additional four individuals have lain in honor, a similar privileged.

The process of lying in state at the Capitol is as follows. The [[coffin]] or casket is usually placed on a [[catafalque]], usually the [[Lincoln catafalque]], so named as it was constructed for lying in state upon the death of [[Abraham Lincoln]], after his [[Lincoln Assassination|assassination]] in 1865. The casket is guarded at each of its corners by a serviceperson from each of the branches of the armed forces. In contrast to the practice in the [[United Kingdom]] and other countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], guards at the Capitol face the casket, hold their rifles with their right hand, and keep the rifle butt resting on the floor. After the viewing and ceremony at the Capitol, the remains are taken to the burial location.

=== Lain in honor ===
The United States Congress has created a similar‚Äîthough not identical‚Äîprivilege for distinguished Americans who do not qualify for a lying in state designation. In the process of "lying in honor," the honor guard in the Rotunda is provided by the Capitol Police or another suitable source.

In 1998, [[United States Capitol shooting incident (1998)|Chestnut and Gibson were killed]] while defending the Capitol against a shooter. Congress approved their remains to lie in honor in the Rotunda.  Chestnut was the first [[African American]] to lie in honor. In 2005, upon the death of civil rights activist [[Rosa Parks]], Congress authorized her remains to lie in honor at the Rotunda; Parks was the second African American and the first woman to lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda.&lt;ref name="parks"/&gt; Graham was the first religious leader to be honored in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2018/02/22/billy-graham-to-lie-in-honor-at-the-u-s-capitol/ |title= Billy Graham to lie in honor at the U.S. Capitol |first=Ed |last=O'Keefe |date=February 22, 2018 |access-date=2018-02-28 |newspaper=The Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===States and cities===
Some U.S. states and cities extend similar honors. For example, in the state of Hawaii, three people have been laid in state at the [[Hawaii State Capitol]], among which include famous Hawaiian singer [[Israel Kamakawiwo ªole]] upon his death in 1997, and the aforementioned [[Daniel Inouye]], President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate and Senator from Hawaii. Similarly, after the death of U.S. Senator [[John McCain]], it was announced that he would lie in state at the [[Arizona State Capitol|State Capitol]] in his home state of [[Arizona]] before receiving the same honor at the U.S. Capitol.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the City of [[San Francisco, California]], Mayor [[Ed Lee (politician)|Ed Lee]] laid in state at the Rotunda of [[San Francisco City Hall]] after his death in office in 2017.

==Vatican City==
[[File:Giovanni Paolo II 0013.JPG|thumb|[[Pope John Paul II]]'s body lying in state.]]

A deceased [[pope]] customarily lies in state in the chapel of the [[Apostolic Palace]] and then in [[St. Peter's Basilica]], between the holding of a [[Mass of Visitation]] and a [[Mass of Requiem]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The [[funeral of Pope John Paul II]] was an example of this custom.

==Coptic Patriarchate==
The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] has a tradition of mummifying the deceased pope and placing his body on his throne to enable church followers to have a farewell look at him for a short period of time.
This tradition is one of the ways that ancient Egyptian rituals have survived in the Egyptian church.

The mental world is usually considered to be [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and not [[Objectivity (science)|objective]].

In [[psychologism]], [[mathematical objects]] are mental objects.

[[Descartes]] argued for a mental world as separate from the physical world.&lt;ref name="medi-descart"&gt;''Meditations'', [[Renes Descartes]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Debates regarding [[free will]] include how it could be possible for anything in the mental world to have an effect on the physical world.

[[Reasoning]] laws about a mental world are different than the ones for a [[physical world]].

'''Mindstream''' (''citta-santƒÅna'') in [[Buddhist philosophy]] is the moment-to-moment continuum (Sanskrit: ''sa·πÉtƒÅna'') of sense impressions and mental phenomena,&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal|author= Karunamuni N.D.|title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind|journal=SAGE Open|volume=5 |issue=2 |date=May 2015 | url= http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf | doi=10.1177/2158244015583860}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is also described as continuing from one life to another.&lt;ref&gt;The Noble Eightfold Path: The Way to the End of Suffering by Bhikkhu Bodhi

==Definition==
''{{IAST|Citta-sa·πÉtƒÅna}}'' (Sanskrit), literally "the stream of mind",&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (ed.) with Hodge, Stephen; Jones, Charles; Tinti, Paola (2003). ''A Dictionary of Buddhism''.  Great Britain, Oxford:  Oxford University Press. P.62.  {{ISBN|0-19-860560-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the stream of succeeding moments of mind or awareness. It provides a continuity of the personality in the absence of a permanently abiding "self" ([[ƒÄtman (Hinduism)|ƒÅtman]]), which Buddhism denies. The mindstream provides a continuity from one life to another, akin to the flame of a candle which may be passed from one candle to another:{{sfn|Kyimo|2007|p=118}}{{sfn|Panjvani|2013|p=181}}{{refn|group=note|Compare the analogies in the [[Milinda Panha]]}} 
{{quote|Indian Buddhists see the 'evolution' of mind i[n] terms of the continuity of individual mind-streams from one lifetime to the next, with [[karma]] as the basic causal mechanism whereby transformations are transmitted from one life to the next.&lt;ref name="Waldron, William S. 2007"&gt;Waldron, William S. (undated). ''Buddhist Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Thinking about &lt;nowiki&gt;'Thoughts without a Thinker'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''.

According to Waldron, 
{{quote|[T]he mind stream (''santƒÅna'') increases gradually by the mental afflictions (''kle≈õa'') and by actions (''karma''), and goes again to the next world. In this way the circle of existence is without beginning."&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, William S. (2003). "Common Ground, Common Cause: Buddhism and Science on the Afflictions of Identity" in Wallace, B.

==Etymology==

===Sanskrit===
''Citta'' holds the [[semantic field]] of "that which is conscious", "the act of mental apprehension known as ordinary consciousness", "the conventional and relative mind/heart".&lt;ref name="dharmafellowship.org"&gt;Source: [http://www.dharmafellowship.org/library/essays/buddhist-glossary.htm#santana] (accessed: 13 December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Citta'' has two aspects: "...Its two aspects are attending to and collecting of impressions or traces (Sanskrit: ''[[Vasanas|vƒÅsanƒÅ]]'') cf. ''[[vij√±ƒÅna]]''."&lt;ref name="dharmafellowship.org"/&gt; ''{{IAST|Sa·πÉtƒÅna}}'' or ''santƒÅna'' (Sanskrit) holds the semantic field of "eternal", "continuum", "a series of momentary events" or "life-stream".&lt;ref name="dharmafellowship.org"/&gt;

===Tibetan===
''Citta'' is often rendered as ''sems'' in Tibetan and sa·πÉtƒÅna corresponds to ''rgyud'', which holds the [[semantic field]] of "continuum", "stream", and "thread"--{{IAST|Citta-sa·πÉtƒÅna}} is therefore rendered ''sems rgyud.'' ''Rgyud'' is the term that Tibetan translators (Tibetan: ''lotsawa'') employed to render the Sanskrit term "''[[tantra]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Berzin, Alexander (2002; 2007). ''Making Sense of Tantra''. Source: [http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/archives/e-books/unpublished_manuscripts/making_sense_tantra/pt1/making_sense_tantra_01.html] (accessed: 13 December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Thugs-rgyud'' is a synonym for ''sems rgyud''&lt;ref name="Dharma Dictionary"&gt;[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/Main_Page Dharma Dictionary] (28 December 2005). Source: [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/thugs_rgyud] (accessed: 17 July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;--''Thugs'' holds the semantic field: "Buddha-mind", "([[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightened]]) mind", "[[mind]]", "[[soul]]", "[[spirit]]", "purpose", "intention", "unbiased perspective", "spirituality", "responsiveness", "spiritual significance", "awareness", "primordial (state, experience)", "enlightened mind", "heart", "breast", "feelings" and is sometimes a homonym of "citta" (Sanskrit).&lt;ref&gt;[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/Main_Page Dharma Dictionary] (4 October 2006). Source: [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/thugs] (accessed: 17 July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thugs-rgyud'' holds the [[semantic field]] "wisdom", "transmission", "heart-mind continuum", "mind", "[continuum/ stream of mind]" and "nature of mind."

===Chinese, Korean and Japanese===
The Chinese equivalent of Sanskrit ''citta-sa·πÉtƒÅna'' and Tibetan ''sems-kyi rgyud'' ("mindstream") is ''xin xiangxu'' ({{zh|s=ÂøÉÁõ∏Áª≠|t=ÂøÉÁõ∏Á∫å|p=''xƒ´n xiƒÅngx√π''|w=''hsin hsiang-hs√º''}}).  According to the ''[[Digital Dictionary of Buddhism]]'', ''xƒ´n xiƒÅngx√π'' means "continuance of the mental stream" (from Sanskrit ''citta-sa·πÉtƒÅna'' or ''citta-sa·πÉtati''), contrasted with ''w√∫ xi√†ngx√π'' ÁÑ°Áõ∏Á∫å "no continuity of the mental stream" (from ''asa·πÉtƒÅna'' or ''asa·πÉdhi'') and ''sh√¨ xiƒÅngx√π'' Ë≠òÁõ∏Á∫å "stream of consciousness" (from ''vij√±ƒÅna-sa·πÉtƒÅna'').

This compound combines ''xin'' [[Wikt:ÂøÉ|ÂøÉ]] "heart; mind; thought; conscience; core" and ''xiangxu'' "succeed each other", with ''xiang'' [[Wikt:Áõ∏|Áõ∏]] "each other; one another; mutual; reciprocal" and ''xu'' [[Wikt:Á∫å|Á∫å]] or [[Wikt:Áª≠|Áª≠]] "continue; carry on; succeed". Thus it means "thoughts succeeding each other".

''Xin xiangxu'' is pronounced ''sim sangsok'' in [[Korean language|Korean]] and ''shin s≈çzoku'' in Japanese.

==Origins and development==

The notion of ''citta-santƒÅna'' developed in later Yogacara-thought, where ''citta-santƒÅna'' replaced the notion of [[ƒÅlayavij√±ƒÅna]],{{sfn|Lusthaus|2014|p=7}} the store-house consciousness in which the karmic seeds were stored. It is not a "permanent, unchanging, transmigrating entity", like the atman, but a series of momentary consciousnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Davids, C.A.F. Rhys (1903). "The Soul-Theory in Buddhism" in ''The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland''. Source: [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ENG/rhy.htm] (accessed: Sunday 1 February 2009), pp. 587-588&lt;/ref&gt;

Lusthaus describes the development and doctrinal relationships of [[ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna|the store consciousness]] (''ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna'') and [[tathƒÅgatagarbha|Buddha nature]] (''tathƒÅgatagarbha'') in [[YogƒÅcƒÅra]]. To avoid reification of the ''ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna'',
{{quote|The logico-epistemological wing in part sidestepped the critique by using the term ''citta-santƒÅna'', "mind-stream", instead of ''ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna'', for what amounted to roughly the same idea. It was easier to deny that a "stream" represented a reified self.&lt;ref&gt;Lusthaus, Dan (undated). ''What is and isn't YogƒÅcƒÅra.'' Source: {{cite web|url=http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331102337/http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm |archivedate=31 March 2010 |df= }} (accessed: 4 December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Dharmakirti|Dharmakƒ´rti]] (fl. 7th century) wrote a treatise on the nature of the mind stream in his ''Substantiation of Other mind streams'' (''Sa·πÉt√£n√£ntarasiddhi'').&lt;ref&gt;Source: {{cite web|url=http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_1/fiindolo/gretil/1_sanskr/6_sastra/3_phil/buddh/bsa059_u.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110082146/http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_1/fiindolo/gretil/1_sanskr/6_sastra/3_phil/buddh/bsa059_u.htm |archivedate=10 November 2010 |df= }} (accessed: Wednesday 28 October 2009). There is an English translation of this work by Gupta (1969: pp.81-121) which is a rendering of [[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy|Stcherbatsky]]'s work from the Russian: Gupta, Harish C. (1969). ''Papers of Th. Stcherbatsky''. Calcutta: Indian Studies Past and Present. (translated from Russian by Harish C. Gupta).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dharmakirti the mind stream was beginningless temporal sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, John D. (2004). ''Foundations of Dharmakƒ´rti's philosophy''.

The notion of mind stream was further developed in [[Vajrayana|VajrayƒÅna]] (tantric Buddhism), where "mind stream" (''sems-rgyud'') may be understood as a stream of succeeding moments,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche]] (2002). ''Healing with Form, Energy, and Light''. Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion Publications. {{ISBN|1-55939-176-6}}. p.82&lt;/ref&gt; within a lifetime, but also in-between lifetimes. The 14th Dalai Lama holds it to be a continuum of consciousness, extending over succeeding lifetimes, though without a self or soul.&lt;ref&gt;Lama, Dalai (1997).

'''''Neopets: Petpet Adventures: The Wand of Wishing''''' is an [[Action game|action]] video game, released on March 14, 2006. It is a single-player [[PlayStation Portable]] action/adventure game based on the [[Neopets]] franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=US Playstation|date=2005-05-14|url=http://www.us.playstation.com/NeopetsPetpetAdventures/

==Gameplay==
There are four playable Petpets: Doglefox, Krawk, Mazzew, and Meowclops. Throughout the game, the player can acquire items such as swords, staves, wands, magic spells, and armor for the head and body. It can then be customized with the items. As an [[anthropomorphic]] Petpet from Neopia, the player must find and utilize various items. There is no experience or leveling up to improve the petpet. Instead, tokens have to be won by paying a fee and challenging bosses in the Battledome. Once a player has the correct token for a particular statistic, it then can be used at a trainer. Also available in the Battledome is a  wireless feature where a player's Petpet can fight his friends'. If [[Wireless ad hoc network|Ad Hoc]] multiplayer is used, the entrance fee is removed and the winner still receives the token corresponding to the battledome challenged in.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

==Plot==
The game takes place in the hidden [[Petpet]] world of Petaria, in which the player must retrieve the magical "Wand of Wishing" in order to succeed as a warrior.

==Reception==
IGN praised the game for its cute protagonists and outdoing typical expectations of a franchise game. However, there is criticism of imbalance, such as the difficulty when starting off and the overpowering bows that can be acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=IGN|date=2006-03-24|url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/698/698384p1.html

'''Pelicans''' are a [[genus]] of large [[water bird]]s that make&lt;!-- birds is the subject? --&gt; up the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Pelecanidae'''. They are characterised by a long [[beak]] and a large [[throat pouch]] used for catching [[prey]] and draining water from the scooped-up contents before swallowing. They have predominantly pale plumage, the exceptions being the [[Brown pelican|brown]] and [[Peruvian pelican]]s. The bills, pouches, and bare facial skin of all species become brightly coloured before the breeding season. The eight living pelican species have a patchy global distribution, ranging [[latitude|latitudinally]] from the [[tropics]] to the [[temperate zone]], though they are absent from interior South America and from [[polar region]]s and the open ocean.

Long thought to be related to [[frigatebird]]s, [[cormorant]]s, [[tropicbird]]s, and [[Sulidae|gannets and boobies]], pelicans instead are now known to be most closely related to the [[shoebill]] and [[hamerkop]], and are placed in the order [[Pelecaniformes]]. [[Ibis]]es, [[spoonbill]]s, [[heron]]s, and the desolate [[bittern]]s have been classified in the same order. Fossil evidence of pelicans dates back  at least 30 million years to the remains of a beak very similar to that of modern species recovered from [[Oligocene]] strata in France. They are thought to have evolved in the [[Old World]] and spread into the Americas; this is reflected in the relationships within the genus as the eight species divide into Old World and [[New World]] lineages.

Pelicans frequent inland and coastal waters, where they feed principally on fish, catching them at or near the water surface. They are [[wikt:gregarious|gregarious]] birds, travelling in flocks, [[Cooperative hunting|hunting cooperatively]], and breeding [[bird colony|colonially]]. Four white-plumaged species tend to nest on the ground, and four brown or grey-plumaged species nest mainly in trees. The relationship between pelicans and people has often been contentious. The birds have been persecuted because of their perceived competition with commercial and recreational fishing. Their populations have fallen through habitat destruction, disturbance, and environmental pollution, and three species are of conservation concern. They also have a long history of cultural significance in [[mythology]], and in Christian and [[heraldry|heraldic]] [[iconography]].

==Taxonomy and systematics==

===Etymology===
The genus ''Pelecanus'' was first formally described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in 1758 in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] of his ''Systema Naturae'''. He described the distinguishing characteristics as a straight bill hooked at the tip, linear nostrils, a bare face, and fully webbed feet. This early definition included frigatebirds, cormorants, and [[Sulidae|sulids]], as well as pelicans.&lt;ref name="linnaeus"&gt;{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C. | authorlink=Carl Linnaeus | title=Systema Naturae per Regna Tria Naturae, Secundum Classes, Ordines, Genera, Species, cum Characteribus, Differentiis, Synonymis, Locis.

===Taxonomy===
{{main|Pelecaniformes#Systematics and evolution}}
The family Pelecanidae was introduced (as Pelicanea) by the French [[polymath]] [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Rafinesque | first=Constantine Samuel | author-link=Constantine Samuel Rafinesque | year=1815 | title=Analyse de la nature ou, Tableau de l'univers et des corps organis√©s | publisher=Self-published | place=Palermo | language=French | page=72 | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/48310150 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bock | first=Walter J. | year=1994 | title=History and Nomenclature of Avian Family-Group Names | series=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History | volume= Number 222 | publisher=American Museum of Natural History | place=New York | pages=131, 252 | url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/handle/2246/830 }}&lt;!--Linked page allows download of the 48MB pdf--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Pelicans give their name to the Pelecaniformes, an [[order (biology)|order]] which has a varied taxonomic history. [[Tropicbird]]s, [[darter]]s, cormorants, gannets, boobies, and frigatebirds, all traditional members of the order, have since been reclassified: tropicbirds into their own order, [[Phaethontiformes]], and the remainder into the Suliformes. In their place, herons, ibises, spoonbills, the hamerkop, and the shoebill have now been transferred into the Pelecaniformes.&lt;ref name=Hackett/&gt; Molecular evidence suggests that the shoebill and the hamerkop form a [[sister group]] to the pelicans,&lt;ref name="smith2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Smith | first= N.D. | year=2010 | title= Phylogenetic Analysis of Pelecaniformes (Aves) Based on Osteological Data: Implications for Waterbird Phylogeny and Fossil Calibration Studies | journal= PLoS ONE | volume=5 | issue = 10 | page= e13354 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0013354 | editor1-last= Desalle | editor1-first= Robert | pmid=20976229 | pmc=2954798| bibcode= 2010PLoSO...513354S }}&lt;/ref&gt; though  some doubt exists as to the exact relationships among the three lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mayr | first1 = G. | title = Avian higher-level phylogeny: Well-supported clades and what we can learn from a phylogenetic analysis of 2954 morphological characters | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0469.2007.00433.x | journal = Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research | volume = 46| pages = 63‚Äì72 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Living species===
The eight living pelican species were traditionally divided into two groups, one containing four ground-nesters with mainly white adult plumage ([[Australian pelican|Australian]], [[Dalmatian pelican|Dalmatian]], [[Great white pelican|great white]], and [[American white pelican]]s), and one containing four grey- or brown-plumaged species which nest preferentially either in trees ([[Pink-backed pelican|pink-backed]], [[Spot-billed pelican|spot-billed]] and [[brown pelican]]s), or on sea rocks ([[Peruvian pelican]]). The largely marine brown and Peruvian pelicans, formerly considered [[conspecific]],&lt;ref name=NSS/&gt; are sometimes separated from the others by placement in the [[subgenus]] ''[[Leptopelicanus]]''&lt;ref name="hanzab1a"&gt;{{cite book| others = Marchant, S.; Higgins, P.J.

DNA sequencing of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes yielded  quite different relationships; the three [[New World]] pelicans formed one lineage, with the American white pelican sister to the two brown pelicans, and the five Old World species the other. The Dalmatian, pink-backed, and spot-billed were all closely related to one another, while the Australian white pelican was their next-closest relative. The great white pelican also belonged to this lineage, but was the first to diverge from the common ancestor of the other four species. This finding suggests that pelicans evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas, and that preference for tree- or ground-nesting is more related to size than genetics.&lt;ref name=kennedy&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kennedy, Martyn |author2=Taylor, Scott A. |author3=N√°dvorn√≠k, Petr |author4=Spencer, Hamish G. |date=2013|title=The phylogenetic relationships of the extant pelicans inferred from DNA sequence data|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=66|issue=1|pages=215‚Äì22|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2012.09.034|pmid=23059726 |url=https://www.colorado.edu/lab/taylor/sites/default/files/attached-files/kennedy_et_al._2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- cites para --&gt;

===Air sacs===
Anatomical dissections of two brown pelicans in 1939 showed that pelicans have a network of subcutaneous [[Bird anatomy#Skeletal system|air sacs]] under their skin situated across the ventral surface including the throat, breast, and undersides of the wings, as well as having air sacs in their bones.&lt;ref name="richardson39"/&gt; The air sacs are connected to the airways of the respiratory system, and the pelican can keep its air sacs inflated by closing its [[glottis]], but  how air sacs are inflated is not clear.&lt;ref name="richardson39"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=Frank|year=1939|title=Functional Aspects of the Pneumatic System of the California Brown Pelican|journal=The Condor|volume=41|issue=1|pages=13‚Äì17|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v041n01/p0013-p0017.pdf|doi=10.2307/1364267}}&lt;/ref&gt; The air sacs serve to keep the pelican remarkably buoyant in the water&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bumstead| first = Pat| title = Canadian Feathers : a Loon-atics Guide to Anting, Mimicry and Dump-nesting| url = https://books.google.com/?id=vmkmuyvhxqAC| year = 2001| publisher = Simply Wild Publications| location = Calgary, Alberta| isbn = 0968927807| page = 129 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may also cushion the impact of the pelican's body on the water surface when they dive from flight into water to catch fish.&lt;ref name="richardson39"/&gt; Superficial air sacs may also help to round body contours (especially over the abdomen, where surface protuberances may be caused by viscera changing size and position) to enable the overlying feathers to form more effective heat insulation and also to enable feathers to be held in position for good aerodynamics.&lt;ref name="richardson39"/&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
Modern pelicans are found on all continents except Antarctica. They primarily inhabit warm regions, although breeding ranges extend to latitudes of 45¬∞ South (Australian pelicans in [[Tasmania]]) and 60¬∞ North (American white pelicans in western Canada).&lt;ref name="NSS"&gt;{{cite book| last = Nelson| first = J.

==Behaviour and ecology==
[[File:Australian pelican in flight.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Australian pelican gliding|An Australian pelican gliding with its large wings extended]]
Pelicans swim well with their strong legs and their webbed feet. They rub the backs of their heads on their [[preen gland]]s to pick up an oily secretion, which they transfer to their [[plumage]] to waterproof it.&lt;ref name=NSS/&gt; Holding their wings only loosely against their bodies, pelicans float with relatively little of their bodies below the water surface.&lt;ref name="beaman"/&gt; They dissipate excess heat by gular flutter ‚Äì rippling the skin of the throat and pouch with the bill open to promote [[evaporative cooling]].&lt;ref name=hanzab1a/&gt; They roost and loaf communally on beaches, sandbanks, and in shallow water.&lt;ref name=hanzab1a/&gt;

A fibrous layer deep in the breast muscles can hold the wings rigidly horizontal for gliding and soaring. Thus, they use [[thermal]]s for soaring to heights of 3000&amp;nbsp;m (10,000&amp;nbsp;ft) or more,&lt;ref name=ag/&gt; combined both with gliding and with flapping flight in [[V formation]], to commute distances  up to {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} to feeding areas.&lt;ref name=NSS/&gt; Pelicans also fly low (or "skim") over stretches of water, using a phenomenon known as [[Ground effect (aircraft)|ground effect]] to reduce [[Lift-induced drag|drag]] and increase [[Lift (force)|lift]]. As the air flows between the wings and the water surface, it is compressed to a higher density and exerts a stronger upward force against the bird above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loyno.edu/lucec/natural-history-writings/bird-flight-over-water|title=Bird Flight Over Water|last=Thomas|first=Bob|date=2 June 2011|work=College of Social Sciences Intranet |publisher=Center for Environmental Communication, Loyola University|accessdate=1 August 2012|location=New Orleans, Louisiana}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, substantial energy is saved while flying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hainsworth|first=F.

Pelicans are [[wikt:gregarious|gregarious]] and nest colonially. Pairs are monogamous for a single season, but the pair bond extends only to the nesting area; mates are independent away from the nest. The ground-nesting (white) species have a complex communal courtship involving a group of males chasing a single female in the air, on land, or in the water while pointing, gaping, and thrusting their bills at each other. They can finish the process in a day. The tree-nesting species have a simpler process in which perched males advertise for females.&lt;ref name=NSS/&gt; The location of the breeding colony is constrained by the availability of an ample supply of fish to eat, although pelicans can use thermals to soar and commute for hundreds of kilometres daily to fetch food.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

The Australian pelican has two reproductive strategies depending on the local degree of environmental predictability. Colonies of tens or hundreds, rarely thousands, of birds breed regularly on small coastal and subcoastal islands where food is seasonally or permanently available. In arid inland Australia, especially in the [[endorheic basin|endorheic]] [[Lake Eyre basin]], pelicans breed opportunistically in very large numbers of up to 50,000 pairs, when irregular major floods, which may be many years apart, fill [[ephemeral]] [[salt lake]]s and provide large amounts of food for several months before drying out again.&lt;ref name="ag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/pelicans-in-australia.htm |title=Mysteries of the Australian pelican |accessdate=18 June 2012 |first=Julian |last=Reid |publisher=Australian Geographic |date=28 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614181957/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/pelicans-in-australia.htm |archive-date=14 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all species, copulation takes place at the nest site; it begins shortly after pairing and continues for 3‚Äì10&amp;nbsp;days before egg-laying. The male brings the nesting material, in ground-nesting species (which may not build a nest) sometimes in the pouch, and in tree-nesting species crosswise in the bill. The female then heaps the material up to form a simple structure.&lt;ref name=NSS/&gt;

The eggs are oval, white, and coarsely textured.&lt;ref name=hanzab1a/&gt; All species normally lay at least two eggs; the usual clutch size is one to three, rarely up to six.&lt;ref name=hanzab1a/&gt; Both sexes incubate with the eggs on top of or below the feet; they may display when changing shifts. Incubation takes 30‚Äì36 days;&lt;ref name=hanzab1a/&gt; hatching success for undisturbed pairs can be as high as 95%, but because of sibling competition or [[siblicide]], in the wild, usually all but one nestling dies within the first few weeks (later in the pink-backed and spot-billed species). Both parents feed their young. Small chicks are fed by [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]]; after about a week, they are able to put their heads into their parents' pouches and feed themselves.&lt;ref name="DofB"&gt;{{cite book| editor = Campbell, Bruce| editor2 =  Lack, Elizabeth| title = A Dictionary of Birds| year = 1985| publisher = Poyser| location = Calton, United Kingdom| isbn = 0-85661-039-9| page = 443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes before, or especially after, being fed, they may seem to have a [[seizure]] that ends in falling unconscious; the reason is not clearly known.&lt;ref name=NSS/&gt;

Parents of ground-nesting species sometimes drag older young around roughly by the head before feeding them. From about 25 days old,&lt;ref name=hanzab1a/&gt; the young of these species gather in "pods" or "[[Cr√®che (zoology)|cr√®ches]]" of up to 100 birds in which parents recognise and feed only their own offspring. By 6‚Äì8&amp;nbsp;weeks they wander around, occasionally swimming, and may practise communal feeding.&lt;ref name=NSS/&gt; Young of all species [[fledge]] 10‚Äì12&amp;nbsp;weeks after hatching. They may remain with their parents afterwards, but are now seldom or never fed. They are mature at three or four years old.&lt;ref name=hanzab1a/&gt; Overall breeding success is highly variable.&lt;ref name=NSS/&gt; Pelicans live for 15 to 25 years in the wild, although one reached an age of 54 years in captivity.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

===Feeding===
The diet of pelicans usually consists of fish,&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Perrins, Christopher M. |editor2=Middleton, Alex L.A | title = Encyclopedia of Birds| origyear = 1985| year = 1998| publisher = Facts on File| location = New York, New York| isbn = 0-8160-1150-8| pages = 53‚Äì54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but occasionally [[amphibian]]s, turtles, [[crustacean]]s, [[insect]]s, birds, and mammals are also eaten.&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Pelican Swallows Pigeon in Park|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6083468.stm|publisher = BBC News|date = 25 October 2006|accessdate =25 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Pelican's Pigeon Meal not so Rare|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6098678.stm|publisher = BBC News|author=Clarke, James |date = 30 October 2006|accessdate =5 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elliott 295‚Äì298, 309‚Äì311"&gt;Elliott (1992), p. 295-298, 309-311&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the preferred prey fish varies depending on pelican species and location. For example, in Africa, the pink-backed pelican generally takes fish ranging in size from [[Juvenile fish|fry]] up to {{convert|400|g|lb|abbr=on|1}} and the great white pelican prefers somewhat larger fish, up to {{convert|600|g|lb|abbr=on|1}}, but in Europe, the latter species has been recorded taking fish up to {{convert|1850|g|lb|abbr=on|1}}.&lt;ref name="Elliott 295‚Äì298, 309‚Äì311"/&gt; In deep water, white pelicans often fish alone. Nearer the shore, several encircle schools of small fish or form a line to drive them into the shallows, beating their wings on the water surface and then scooping up the prey.&lt;ref name="NationalGeographic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/pelican/ |title=Pelican ''Pelecanus''|work=Factsheet |publisher=National Geographic |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although all pelican species may feed in groups or alone, the Dalmantian, pink-backed, and spot-billed pelicans are the only ones to prefer solitary feeding. When fishing in groups, all pelican species have been known to work together to catch their prey, and Dalmantian pelicans may even cooperate with [[great cormorant]]s.&lt;ref name="Elliott 295‚Äì298, 309‚Äì311"/&gt; They catch multiple small fish by expanding the throat pouch, which must be drained above the water surface before swallowing. This operation takes up to a minute, during which time other seabirds may [[kleptoparasitism|steal]] the fish.

[[File:Pelecanus occidentalis -Jamaica -fishing-8.ogv|left|thumb|thumbtime=2.5|alt=Brown pelicans diving|[[Brown pelican]]s diving into the sea to catch fish in [[Jamaica]]]]

==Status and conservation==

===Populations===
Globally, pelican populations are adversely affected by these main factors: declining supplies of fish through overfishing or water pollution, destruction of habitat, direct effects of human activity such as disturbance at nesting colonies, hunting and culling, entanglement in fishing lines and hooks, and the presence of pollutants such as [[DDT]] and [[endrin]]. Most species' populations are more or less stable, although three are classified by the [[IUCN]] as being at risk. All species breed readily in zoos, which is potentially useful for conservation management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Crivelli | first1= Alain J.| last2= Schreiber| first2= Ralph W.| doi = 10.1016/0006-3207(84)90063-6 | title = Status of the Pelecanidae | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 147‚Äì56 | year = 1984 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Peruvian pelican is listed as near threatened because, although the population is estimated by [[BirdLife International]] to exceed 500,000 mature individuals, and is possibly increasing, it has been much higher in the past. It declined dramatically during the 1998 [[El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation|El Ni√±o]] event and could experience similar declines in the future. Conservation needs include regular monitoring throughout the range to determine population trends, particularly after El Ni√±o years, restricting human access to important breeding colonies, and assessing interactions with fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3816 |title=Peruvian Pelican |accessdate=7 August 2012 |work=BirdLife species factsheet |publisher=BirdLife International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spot-billed pelican has an estimated population between 13,000 and 18,000 and is considered to be near threatened in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Numbers declined substantially during the 20th century, one crucial factor being the eradication of the important [[Sittaung River|Sittaung valley]] breeding colony in Burma through deforestation and the loss of feeding sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3812 |title=Spot-billed Pelican |accessdate=11 August 2012 |work=Species factsheet |publisher=BirdLife International}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief threats it faces are from habitat loss and human disturbance, but populations have mostly stabilised following increased protection in India and Cambodia.&lt;ref name="iucnphillippenis"&gt;{{IUCN2010 |assessor=BirdLife International |year=2011 |id=106003812 |title=Pelecanus philippensis |version=2011.2 |downloaded=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pink-backed pelican has a large population ranging over much of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. In the absence of substantial threats or evidence of declines across its range, its conservation status is assessed as being of least concern. Regional threats include the drainage of wetlands and increasing disturbance in southern Africa. The species is susceptible to [[bioaccumulation]] of toxins and the destruction of nesting trees by logging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3810|title=Pink-backed Pelican |accessdate=7 August 2012 |work=BirdLife species factsheet |publisher=BirdLife International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pelecanus onocrotalus -Kenya -several-8.jpg|right|thumb|[[Great white pelican]]s loafing in Kenya]]
Great white pelicans range over a large area of Africa and southern Asia. The overall trend in numbers is uncertain, with a mix of regional populations that are increasing, declining, stable, or unknown, but  no evidence has been found of rapid overall decline, and the status of the species is assessed as being of least concern. Threats include the drainage of wetlands, persecution and sport hunting, disturbance at the breeding colonies, and contamination by pesticides and heavy metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3809|title=Great White Pelican |accessdate=7 August 2012 |work=BirdLife species factsheet |publisher=BirdLife International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dalmatian pelican has a population estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 following massive declines in the 19th and 20th centuries. The main ongoing threats include hunting, especially in eastern Asia, disturbance, coastal development, collision with overhead power lines, and the over-exploitation of fish stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3811 |title= Dalmatian Pelican |accessdate=9 August 2012 |work=Species factsheet |publisher=BirdLife International}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is listed as near threatened by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as the population trend is downwards, especially in Mongolia, where it is nearly extinct.

===Culling and disturbance===
Pelicans have been persecuted by humans for their perceived competition for fish, despite the fact that their diet overlaps little with fish caught by people.&lt;ref name=Keith05/&gt; Starting in the 1880s, American white pelicans were clubbed and shot, their eggs and young were deliberately destroyed, and their feeding and nesting sites were degraded by water management schemes and wetland drainage.&lt;ref name=Keith05/&gt; Even in the 21st century, an increase in the population of American white pelicans in southeastern Idaho in the US was seen to threaten the recreational [[cutthroat trout]] fishery there, leading to official attempts to reduce pelican numbers through systematic harassment and [[culling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Management of American White Pelicans in Idaho.

Great white pelicans on Dyer Island, in the Western Cape region of South Africa, were culled during the 19th century because their predation of the eggs and chicks of [[guano]]-producing seabirds was seen to threaten the livelihood of the guano collectors.&lt;ref name=esr/&gt; More recently, such predation at South African seabird colonies has impacted on the conservation of threatened seabird populations, especially crowned cormorants, Cape cormorants, and [[bank cormorant]]s. This has led to suggestions that pelican numbers should be controlled at vulnerable colonies.&lt;ref name=esr/&gt;

Apart from habitat destruction and deliberate, targeted persecution, pelicans are vulnerable to disturbance at their breeding colonies by birdwatchers, photographers, and other curious visitors. Human presence alone can cause the birds to accidentally displace or destroy their eggs, leave hatchlings exposed to predators and adverse weather, or even abandon their colonies completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.showFile&amp;rep=file&amp;fil=CodeofPractice.pdf |title= Code Of Practice for the Protection of the Dalmatian Pelican: |accessdate=3 August 2012 |work=Information leaflet |publisher=Life Natura Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.mprnews.org/statewide/2012/05/loving_em_to_death/ |title=Loving 'em to death |accessdate=14 February 2017 |work=Statewide |first=Dan |last=Gunderson |publisher=MPR News |date=16 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cfgc07"&gt;{{cite book |title=Status Review of California Brown Pelican |author1=Burkett, Esther |author2=Logsdon, Randi J. |author3=Fien, Kristi M. |year=2007 |series=California Fish and Game Commission Reports |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Planning and Evaluation |url=http://www.dfg.ca.gov/wildlife/nongame/publications/docs/BRPEStatusReviewJan0308.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220103002/http://www.dfg.ca.gov/wildlife/nongame/publications/docs/BRPEStatusReviewJan0308.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DDT pollution in the environment was a major cause of decline of brown pelican populations in North America in the 1950s and 1960s. It entered the oceanic [[food web]], contaminating and accumulating in several species, including one of the pelican‚Äôs primary food fish ‚Äì the [[northern anchovy]]. Its [[metabolite]] [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]] is a reproductive [[wikt:toxicant|toxicant]] in pelicans and many other birds, causing eggshell thinning and weakening, and consequent breeding failure through the eggs being accidentally crushed by brooding birds. Since an effective ban on the use of DDT was implemented in the US in 1972, the eggshells of breeding brown pelicans there have thickened and their populations have largely recovered.&lt;ref name="usepa1980"&gt;{{cite book |title= National accomplishments in pollution control, 1970‚Äì1980: some case histories|isbn=1236274539 |author=Anon |year=1980 |publisher= U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Planning and Evaluation|pages=183‚Äì184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/DDT_and_Birds.html |title=DDT and Birds |accessdate=6 August 2012 |author1=Ehrlich, Paul R. |author2=Dobkin, David S. |author3=Wheye, Darryl |publisher=Stanford University |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, following the major decline in brown pelican numbers in Louisiana from DDT poisoning, 500 pelicans were imported from Florida to augment and re-establish the population; over 300 subsequently died in April and May 1975 from poisoning by the pesticide endrin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19820428&amp;id=075dAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Fl4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3543,7071462|title= Bird species regroup with residue decline |accessdate=8 August 2012 |work=The Victoria Advocate: Julius Ermis‚Äô Outdoors |author=Ermis, Julius |publisher=Google News |date=29 April 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 14,000 pelicans, including 7500 American white pelicans, perished from [[botulism]] after eating fish from the [[Salton Sea]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=Keith05/&gt; In 1991, abnormal numbers of brown pelicans and [[Brandt's cormorant]]s died at [[Santa Cruz, California]], when their food fish (anchovies) were contaminated with [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] [[domoic acid]], produced by the [[diatom]] ''[[Pseudo-nitzschia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Work, Thierry M. |author2=Barr, Bradd |author3=Beale, Allison M. |author4=Fritz, Lawrence |author5=Quilliam, Michael A. |author6=Wright, Jeffrey L.C. |year=1993|title=Epidemiology of domoic acid poisoning in Brown Pelicans (''Pelecanus occidentalis'') and Brandt's Cormorants (''Phalacrocorax penicillatus'') in California|jstor=20460314 |journal=Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=54‚Äì62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As waterbirds that feed on fish, pelicans are highly susceptible to [[oil spill]]s, both directly by being oiled and by the impact on their food resources. A 2007 report to the California Fish and Game Commission estimated that during the previous 20 years, some 500‚Äì1000 brown pelicans had been affected by oil spills in California.&lt;ref name=cfgc07/&gt; A 2011 report by the [[Center for Biological Diversity]], a year after the April 2010 [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]], said that 932 brown pelicans had been collected after being affected by oiling and estimated that 10 times that number had been harmed as a result of the spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/public_lands/energy/dirty_energy_development/oil_and_gas/gulf_oil_spill/pdfs/GulfWildlifeReport_2011.pdf |title=A Deadly Toll |accessdate=6 August 2012 |work=Report |publisher=Center for Biological Diversity |date= April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where pelicans interact with fishers, through either sharing the same waters or scavenging for fishing refuse, they are especially vulnerable to being hooked and entangled in both active and discarded fishing lines. [[Fish hook]]s are swallowed or catch in the skin of the pouch or webbed feet, and strong [[monofilament fishing line]] can become wound around bill, wings, or legs, resulting in crippling, starvation, and often death. Local rescue organisations have been established in North America and Australia by volunteers to treat and rehabilitate injured pelicans and other wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbwcn.org/#!news-&amp;-events/vstc3=pelican-crisis |title=The Brown Pelican Crisis|accessdate=5 August 2012 |work=News and Events |publisher= Santa Barbara Wildlife Care Network }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collier.ifas.ufl.edu/SeaGrant/pubs/PelicanPub.pdf |title=Quick Reference for Rescuing Hooked Pelicans |accessdate=5 August 2012 |publisher=University of Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Impact of Recreational Fishing on Estuarine Birdlife on the Far North Coast of New South Wales |author1=Ferris, Lance |author2=Ferris, Rochelle |year=2004 |publisher=Australian Seabird Rescue |location=Ballina, New South Wales |url= https://www.box.com/shared/8fcmrpsvobv8y7yg0uap }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parasites and disease===
As with other bird families, pelicans are susceptible to a variety of [[parasitism|parasites]]. Specialist [[bird louse|feather lice]] of the genus ''Piagetella'' are found in the pouches of all species of pelican, but are otherwise only known from New World and Antarctic cormorants. [[Avian malaria]] is carried by the [[mosquito]] ''Culex pipens'', and high densities of these biting insects may force pelican colonies to be abandoned. [[Leech]]es may attach to the [[cloaca|vent]] or sometimes the inside of the pouch.&lt;ref name="Rothschild "&gt;{{cite book |title= Fleas, Flukes and Cuckoos.

Many of these do little harm, but flies may be implicated in the death of nestlings, particularly if they are weak or unwell, and the [[Argasidae|soft tick]] ''Ornithodoros capensis'' sometimes causes adults to desert the nest. Many pelican parasites are found in other bird groups, but several [[louse|lice]] are very [[host (biology)|host-specific]].&lt;ref name= overstreet/&gt;

Healthy pelicans can usually cope with their lice, but sick birds may carry hundreds of individuals, which hastens their demise.

The pelican (''henet'' in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]) was associated in [[Ancient Egypt]] with death and the [[afterlife]]. It was depicted in art on the walls of tombs, and figured in [[funeral|funerary]] texts, as a protective symbol against snakes. ''Henet'' was also referred to in the [[Pyramid Texts]] as the "mother of the king" and thus seen as a goddess. References in nonroyal funerary [[papyrus|papyri]] show that the pelican was believed to possess the ability to prophesy safe passage in the [[underworld]] for someone who had died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Hart, George| title = The Routledge Dictionary Of Egyptian Gods And Goddesses| series = Routledge Dictionaries| year = 2005| publisher = Routledge| location = Abingdon, United Kingdom| isbn = 978-0-415-34495-1| page = 125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[origin myth]] from the [[Murri people]] of [[Queensland]], cited by [[Andrew Lang]], describes how the Australian pelican acquired its black and white plumage. The pelican, formerly a black bird, made a canoe during a flood  to save drowning people. He fell in love with a woman he thus saved, but her friends and she tricked him and escaped. The pelican consequently prepared to go to war against them by daubing himself with white clay as war paint. However, before he had finished, another pelican, on seeing such a strange piebald creature, killed him with its beak, and all such pelicans have been black and white ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Lang, Andrew| title = Myth, Ritual &amp; Religion, Volume 1| origyear=1887|year = 2005| publisher = Cosimo Inc.| location = New York, New York| isbn = 978-1-59605-204-8| pages = 140‚Äì41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alcatraz Island]] was given its name by the Spanish because of the large numbers of brown pelicans nesting present. The word ''alcatraz'' is itself derived from the Arabic ''al-caduos'', a term used for a water-carrying vessel and likened to the pouch of the pelican. The English name albatross is also derived by corruption of the Spanish word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An etymological dictionary of the English Language|author=Skeat, Walter W.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1888|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/stream/etymologicaldict00skeauoft#page/14/mode/2up|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Origin of the Common Names of Birds| first= Martin L. |last=Grant| journal=Bios| volume=22| issue=2 | year=1951| pages=116‚Äì119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Europe, the pelican was thought to be particularly attentive to her young, to the point of providing her own blood by wounding her own breast when no other food was available. As a result, the pelican came to symbolise the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] of Jesus and the [[Eucharist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Gauding, Madonna| title = The Signs and Symbols Bible: The Definitive Guide to Mysterious Markings| url = https://books.google.com/?id=SImTll3uupIC| accessdate = 29 June 2012| year = 2009| publisher = Sterling Publishing Company| location = New York, New York| isbn = 1402770049| page = 263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and usurped the image of the [[lamb of God|lamb and the flag]].&lt;ref name="mcgrath"&gt;{{cite book| author = McGrath, Alister E.| authorlink = Alister McGrath| title = In the beginning: the story of the King James Bible and how it changed a nation, a language and a culture| url = https://books.google.com/?id=kcPkMxCWcZQC| accessdate = 29 June 2012| origyear = 2002| year = 2012| publisher = Anchor Books, a Division of Random House, Inc.| location = New York| isbn = 1444745263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A reference to this mythical characteristic is contained for example in the hymn by [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]], "[[Adoro te devote]]" or "Humbly We Adore Thee", where in the penultimate verse, he describes Christ as the "loving divine pelican, able to provide nourishment from his breast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marajoy.blogspot.co.uk/2007/01/better-translation-please-vote.html |title=Adore Te Devote |author=Joy, Mara |accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The mention of the pelican is in the extra verse included in the comments.--&gt; [[Elizabeth I of England]] adopted the symbol, portraying herself as the "mother of the Church of England".

The self-sacrificial aspect of the pelican was reinforced by the widely read medieval [[bestiary|bestiaries]]. The device of "a pelican in her piety" or "a pelican vulning (from Latin ''vulno'', "to wound") herself" was used in [[heraldry]]. An older version of the myth is that the pelican used to kill its young then resurrect them with its blood, again analogous to the sacrifice of Jesus. Likewise, a folktale from India says that a pelican killed her young by rough treatment, but was then so contrite that she resurrected them with her own blood.&lt;ref name=NSS/&gt;

The legends of self-wounding and the provision of blood may have arisen because of the impression a pelican sometimes gives that it is stabbing itself with its bill. In reality, it often presses this onto its chest to fully empty the pouch. Another possible derivation is the tendency of the bird to rest with its bill on its breast; the Dalmatian pelican has a blood-red pouch in the early breeding season and this may have contributed to the myth.&lt;ref name=NSS/&gt;

====Heraldry====
[[File:Coa Hungary Family Kiszely - Benedekfalva.svg|thumb|The arms of the Kiszely family of [[Benedekfalva]] depict a "pelican in her piety" both in the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] and [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]].]]
Pelicans have featured extensively in heraldry, generally using the Christian symbolism of the pelican as a caring and self-sacrificing parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saunders|first1=Rev.

The Christian Democratic political party known as the [[American Solidarity Party]] uses the pelican as its animal symbol, alluding to its Catholic social teaching platform.

'''Personal web pages''' are [[World Wide Web]] [[web page|pages]] created by an individual to contain content of a personal nature rather than content pertaining to a company, organization or institution.  Personal web pages are primarily used for informative or entertainment purposes but can also be used for personal career marketing (by containing a list of the individual's skills, experience and a [[Curriculum vitae|CV]]), [[social networking]] with other people with shared interests, or as a space for personal expression.

These terms do not usually refer to just a single "page" or [[HTML]] file, but to a collection of webpages and related files under a common [[URL]] or Web address.  In strictly technical terms, a site's actual [[home page]] (index page) often only contains sparse content with some catchy introductory material and serves mostly as a pointer or [[table of contents]] to the more content-rich pages inside, such as [[r√©sum√©]]s, family, hobbies, family genealogy, a web log/diary ("[[blog]]"), opinions, online journals and diaries or other writing, examples of written work, [[digital audio]] sound clips, [[digital video]] clips, [[digital photo]]s, or information about a user's other interests.&lt;ref&gt;"People's Personal Web Sites - People Tell About Themselves"  ..."[http://personalweb.about.com/sitesearch.htm?q=%22some+great+personal+Web+sites%22&amp;SUName=personalweb some great personal Web sites]" -- about.com.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many personal pages only include information of interest to friends and family of the author. However, some webpages set up by hobbyists or enthusiasts of certain subject areas can be valuable topical [[web directories]].

==History==
Since the early 1990s, most Internet Service Providers ([[ISP]]s) provided a free small personal, user-created webpage along with free [[Usenet]] News service.  These were all considered part of full Internet service.  Also several [[free web hosting service]]s such as [[Geocities]] provided free web space for personal web pages.  These free web hosting services would typically include web-based site management and a few pre-configured scripts to easily integrate an input form or [[guestbook]] script into the user's site.  Since the early 2000s, the rise of [[blogging]] and the development of [[user friendly]] web page designing software made it easier for amateur users who did not have [[computer programming]] or [[website designer]] training to create personal web pages. Some website design websites provided free ready-made blogging scripts, where all the user had to do was input her content into a template. At the same time, a personal web presence became easier with the increased popularity of [[social networking service]]s, some with blogging platforms such as [[LiveJournal]] and [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]. These websites provided an attractive and easy-to-use [[content management system]] for regular users. Most of the early personal websites were [[Web 1.0]] style, in which a static display of text and images or photos was displayed to individuals who came to the page. About the only interaction that was possible on these early websites was signing the virtual "[[guestbook]]".

With the collapse of the [[dot-com bubble]] in the late 1990s, the ISP industry consolidated, and the focus of web hosting services shifted away from the surviving ISP companies to independent [[Internet hosting service]]s and to ones with other affiliations.  For example, many university departments provided personal pages for professors  and television broadcasters provided them for their on-air personalities. These free webpages served as a  [[perquisite]] ("perk") for staff, while at the same time boosting the Web visibility of the parent organization.  [[Web hosting]] companies either charge a monthly fee, or provide service that is "free" (advertising based) for personal web pages.  These are priced or limited according to the total size of all files in bytes on the host's hard drive, or by [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], (traffic), or by some combination of both.  For those customers who continue to use their ISP for these services, national ISPs commonly continue to provide both disk space and help including ready-made drop-in scripts.&lt;ref&gt;HostingLords.com: "Personal Web Page [http://hostinglords.com/getting-started-with-personal-web-pages/]"&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of [[Web 2.0]]-style websites, both professional websites and user-created, amateur websites tended to contain interactive features, such as "clickable" links to online newspaper articles or favourite websites, the option to comment on content displayed on the website, the option to [[Tag (metadata)|"tag"]] images, videos or links on the site, the option of "clicking" on an image to enlarge it or find out more information, the option of [[Crowdsourcing|User participation]] for website guests to evaluate or review the pages, or even the option to create new [[user-generated content]] for others to see. A key difference between Web 1.0 personal webpages and Web 2.0 personal pages was while the former tended to be created by [[hacker]]s, [[computer programmer]]s and computer hobbyists, the latter were created by a much wider variety of users, including individuals whose main interests lay in hobbies or topics outside of computers (e.g., [[indie music]] fans, [[political activism|political activists]], and [[social entrepreneur]]s).

==Motivations==
[[File:Nikitak de tl.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A personal web page user's [[logo]] from their homepage.]]
Many people maintain personal web pages to express their opinions on issues ranging from news and politics to movies or to serve as a showcase for their creative endeavors in writing, [[songwriting]], poetry or music.  They also provide a link from the world to the individual (and from the individual to the world) along the lines of a [[telephone book]] listing. Some people use their personal web page as a communication method. For example, an aspiring artist might give out business cards with her personal web page, and invite people to visit her page and see her artwork, "like" her page or sign her guestbook. For users not well-versed in [[HTML]] and other Web technologies, personal accounts with social networking services may be faster to set up for creating a simple personal [[Web presence]] (due in part to the communal nature of social networks), provided that the page's author does not object to the network's [[online advertising]] and in some cases exclusion of readers and browsers who do not wish to open an account.  Institutions such as universities often provide home page facilities to their members which are both advertisement-free and world-readable without registration, although the content might be subject to institutional rules (e.g., against inappropriate photos or [[hate speech]]).

A personal web page can be used for [[self promotion]] for a person's [[small business]] or [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial venture]], to promote an amateur [[rock band]] they play in, to promote community activities or charitable causes they support, to provide quick access to information about the user, or just as something "cool" to do.&lt;ref&gt;Eight [http://lifehacker.com/5881321/eight-clever-things-you-can-do-with-your-underused-personal-domain-name Clever Things You Can Do] with Your Underused Personal Domain Name - lifehacker.com&lt;/ref&gt; A personal web page gives the owner generally more control on presence in search results and how he/she wishes to be viewed online. It also allows more freedom in types and quantity of content than a social network profile offers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2013/09/30/why-you-need-your-own-website-for-a-job-search/|title=Beyond LinkedIn - Why You Need Your Own Website For A Job Search|first=Next|last=Avenue|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can link various social media profiles with each other. It can be used to correct the record on something, or clear up potential confusion between you and someone with the same name.&lt;ref&gt;Motivation for: "A Web Page of One's Own" - WSJ.com --  http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121562102257039585.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iammarkzuckerberg.com/|title=Mark Zuckerberg - Facebook - The Social Network|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early personal web pages were often called "home pages" and were intended to be set as a default page in a web browser's preferences, usually by their owner. These pages would often contain links, to-do lists, and other information their author found useful. In the days when [[search engine]]s were in their infancy, these pages (and the links they contained) could be an important resource in navigating the web.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In the 2010s, some amateur writers, bands and [[filmmaker]]s release digital versions of their stories, [[song]]s and [[short films]] online, with the aim of gaining an audience and becoming more well-known. While the huge number of aspiring artists posting their work online makes it unlikely for individuals and groups to become popular via the Internet, there are a small number of [[YouTube]] stars who were unknown until their online performances garnered them a huge audience.

==Contrast with social network accounts==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
Both individual, personal web sites and personal social networking accounts give the user a personally customized Web presence.  In the 2010s most casual Internet users join free social networking services such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], or [[Google+]] ''accounts'' to serve many of the same purposes as a personal webpage without having to learn [[web design]] and writing HTML markup.  Yet that prerequisite in many cases is not required, as Web hosting services provide more help to enable regular users to create Web pages.&lt;ref&gt;Create a free personal web page with Google -- "[http://www.google.com/sites/help/intl/en/overview.html Get started with &amp;#91;free&amp;#93; Personal Web Pages]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Social networks often used prefabricated "black box" structures. On one hand, these templates are much easier for neophyte users to work with, since users simply have to add in information in spaces which indicate the required information. Once the user "saves" or finishes entering the information, the social network website's software system automatically creates a fairly professional-looking layout. "Black box" templates are much simpler to begin using and navigating, but more  advanced users may be frustrated that they cannot "tweak" the formatting, amount of content, type of content, etc.  For example, most social networks have rules regarding casual users who are [[uploading]] (loading files onto the website) audio files to their account.  Furthermore, these companies intentionally retain the specific service's [[look and feel]] and identity of each user personal account within that corporate social network.  For example, all profiles may have the same background color, font and website trademark. The emphasis there is on being part of a branded "network," not on the "personal," or the individual.  Thus, these ''accounts'' are not normally thought of as (personal) web sites or home pages.

There are other differences.  Unlike actual personal web pages, social networking services and ad-based "free" web hosting service personnel, advertisers and nanny-[[Internet bot|bots]] can see everything inside the user accounts, and rules are enforced by the firm,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} ''not by the courts'' as would be the case with a personally owned, full-featured personal web page.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}  However some social services allow the display of almost any content or media produced by the site's creator.  This avenue of distribution satisfies most amateurs and aspiring content creators.  Web site creation tools permitted by some companies have the potential to allow users more flexibility. As a rule of thumb, the amount of creative freedom one is allowed in creating a personal Web page can be predicted by the site's [[URL]].  A pure URL similar to www.yourname.com predicts total ownership and the resulting rights.  But a shared-name URL similar to www.yourname.home.othercompany.com suggests account rental and regulations which benefit or protect a corporation (in this case, Othercompany Inc).{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

"Free" sites based on advertising revenue face the dilemma that while relaxation of the rules encourages users to post their feelings and opinions and upload [[user-generated content]] with less fear of being censored or shut down, it also increases the risk of an offended sponsor pulling its sponsorship, if offensive materials or comments are made online.  With more uploading and content-posting freedom comes an increased risk of copyright and defamation lawsuits, [[hate speech]] charges and other legal problems.  Free hosting services do not allow users many options to customize the look of pages, because this would reduce page uniformity, thus reducing the common "look and feel" on the website, which becomes a key part of its identity and "branding".  In short, if a social networking company allowed total personal freedom of content posting and profile modification for users, it also risks a degradation of its own look-and-feel, branding, function, and profit and legal risks.  In the 2010s, this balance of interests is leading toward more user choices and a narrowing of the differences between personal web sites and other personal web presence providers.

==Official celebrity sites==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
Many [[celebrity|celebrities]] from the [[movie]]s, [[TV show]]s, [[professional sports]] and [[popular music]] have websites.  Were their owners not famous, some might think due to their tone and personal ambiance that these sites were personal web pages.  However, the celebrity is the "product" or brand being sold, and however casual a celebrity website may appear, with short [[blog]] posts and comments appearing on a regular basis, these are typically professionally authored and maintained. Some celebrities' [[public relations]] firms and managers hire [[ghostwriter]]s to author blog posts and Tweets in the style of the celebrity.  The celebrity status of the subject and the existence of separate [[fansite|fan-created sites]] (over which the celebrity in question has no direct control) leads the existence of multiple websites for each celebrity: a personal site authorized by the celebrity and maintained by an individual or company directly associated with the celebrity to be labeled an "official website", and one or more fan-run websites.  This designation is often a seal of approval and an assurance to the public that the information provided on the site (including [[News release|press release]]s, tour dates, and promotional materials) has been authored or approved by the celebrity in question.  Some celebrities involved in criminal and civil trials, such as late pop star [[Michael Jackson]] and media mogul [[Martha Stewart]], as well as celebrity chef [[Paula Deen]] establish official websites to issue statements to the press and to respond to statements and press releases issued by the prosecuting officials. Most celebrity sites are created and maintained by marketing and web professionals employed by the celebrity or the celebrity's [[publicist]]; however, some celebrities, such as film director [[Roger Avary]], actor [[Wil Wheaton]], and [[video game]] developer [[John Romero]], maintain their own official sites without professional help, although many of them still use third-party templates and blogging software.

==Sites of academics==
Academic professionals (especially at the college and university level), including [[professor]]s and researchers, are often given online space for creating and storing personal [[web document]]s, including personal web pages, [[Curriculum vitae|CV]]s and a list of their books, academic papers and conference presentations, on the websites of their employers.  This goes back to the early decade of the World Wide Web and its original purpose of providing a quick and easy way for academics to share research papers and data. Many professors post a digital photo on their profile page. In the 2010s, some professors and researchers have excerpts from their published articles and books, or even the full text of some articles. Some academics in the 2010s use content-rich, interactive [[Web 2.0]] features on their websites, such as clips of television interviews, [[podcast]]s, and space for online comments or discussion.

==Domain names==
Many people choose a domain name like ''FirstnameLastname.com'' to host their personal website on (e.g., patxhosa.com), whereas outside the English-speaking world, the home country's [[top level domain]] (TLD) is commonly used. People with common names may choose to add their middle name or initial in the URL if the primary choice of domain name is already in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fizzle.co/sparkline/personal-domain-names|title=8 Great Examples of Personal Domain Names in Action|date=14 June 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a woman named "Jane Doe" will probably find that "janedoe.com" is already taken, so she may have to use a variant of her name, such as adding in a number ("janedoe1.com"), a birth year ("janedoe1980.com") or a middle initial ("janeqdoe.com"). The [[.name]] [[TLD]] is specifically intended to be used for personal web pages, but has not proven to be popular. Personal websites may instead use other generic TLDs like [[.me]], [[.co]], [[.net]] and [[.info]], but also [[.com]], [[.biz]] and [[.org]], even though individuals rarely think of themselves as companies or (non-profit) organizations. Some people opt to find a TLD that forms a word when combined with the domain name; this is known as [[domain hacks|domain hacking]].

They are enhanced remakes of the 1998 video game ''[[Pok√©mon Yellow]]''. The games also feature integration with the mobile game ''[[Pok√©mon Go]]'' and support a new optional controller, the Pok√© Ball Plus.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Pok√©mon Let's Go.png|thumb|left|A screenshot from [[Nintendo]]'s [[Nintendo Treehouse]] [[live stream]] broadcast at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018]] (E3 2018) depicting the [[player character]] moving through tall grass with visible [[List of Pok√©mon|Pok√©mon]] walking around in the grass]]{{Subsections|date=November 2018}}
''Pok√©mon: Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'' are set in the [[Pok√©mon universe#Kanto|Kanto region]] and include the original 151 [[List of Pok√©mon|Pok√©mon]] creatures in addition to their respective Mega Evolved forms from ''[[Pok√©mon X and Y]]'' &amp; ''[[Pok√©mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]]'', and their Alolan Forms from [[Pok√©mon Sun and Moon|''Sun'' and ''Moon'']]. ''Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'' feature common elements of the main series, such as battling [[non-player character]] Pok√©mon Trainers and Gym Leaders with caught Pok√©mon creatures. However, instead of battling them like the traditional battle system of other major [[List of Pok√©mon video games|''Pok√©mon'' role-playing games]] (RPGs), the catching of Pok√©mon creatures uses a different mechanic that is based on the mobile spin-off game ''[[Pok√©mon Go]]'' where players throw [[Pok√© Ball]]s at a wild Pok√©mon by using the [[motion controls]] of the [[Joy-Con]] controller.&lt;ref name="Polygon"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/29/17407414/pokemon-nintendo-switch-lets-go-pikachu-version-eevee-version |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530042425/https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/29/17407414/pokemon-nintendo-switch-lets-go-pikachu-version-eevee-version |title=Pok√©mon Let's Go! launches on Nintendo Switch in November |last=Frank |first=Allegra |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=May 29, 2018 |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |archivedate=May 30, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="announcement"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-and-lets-go-eevee-announce/1100-6459249 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530041241/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-and-lets-go-eevee-announce/1100-6459249 |title=Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu And Let's Go Eevee Announced For Nintendo Switch |last=Plagge |first=Kallie |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=May 29, 2018 |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |archivedate=May 30, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action can also be performed with a button press when the Joy-Con controllers are docked to the console in hand-held mode, but this still requires using the motion controls to aim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-07-motion-controls-are-compulsory-for-catching-pokemon-in-lets-go-pikachu-and-eevee|title=Motion controls are compulsory for catching Pok√©mon in Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee|work=Eurogamer.net|access-date=June 22, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a player uses the motion controls, the catching of Pok√©mon is based on the player's timing rather than accuracy. Although it {{em|is}} possible to miss a throw, the ball is almost guaranteed to hit the Pok√©mon.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer post-E3 2018"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-12-pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-eevee-guide-release-date-5010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614013403/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-12-pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-eevee-guide-release-date-5010 |title=Pok√©mon Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee release date, confirmed feature list, plus everything we know about the 2019 Pok√©mon Switch RPG |last=Tapsell |first=Chris |website=[[Eurogamer]] |date=June 12, 2018 |accessdate=June 14, 2018 |archivedate=June 14, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The games' control scheme is designed to only require one Joy-Con per player, and the games support cooperative [[multiplayer]]. If another player shakes a second Joy-Con, they join the current player and are able to partake in battles with Pok√©mon Trainers and wild Pok√©mon encounters, allowing them to aid the catching of wild Pok√©mon. When playing multiplayer, Trainer battles become battles of two Pok√©mon against one, and in wild encounters, there is the possibility for each player to throw a Pok√© Ball at the same time, doubling the chances of capturing the Pok√©mon.

The player character starts with either a [[Pikachu]] or an [[Eevee]]‚Äîdepending on the version‚Äîwhich sits on the player character's shoulder in the [[overworld]]. This mechanic is similar to the "walking Pok√©mon" mechanic first introduced in ''[[Pok√©mon Yellow]]'', in which Pikachu followed the player character throughout the entire game.&lt;ref name="Polygon" /&gt; The player character's partner Pok√©mon wiggles its tail when the player is near a hidden item, and it can be dressed up for further customization. Similarly to [[Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pok√©mon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']], the player may also choose a secondary Pok√©mon to follow them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17455722/pokemon-lets-go-preview-poke-ball-plus-controller-e3-nintendo |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613205353/https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17455722/pokemon-lets-go-preview-poke-ball-plus-controller-e3-nintendo |title=Pok√©mon: Let's Go is a simple game improved by its pricey pok√©ball controller |last=Farokhmanesh |first=Megan |website=[[The Verge]] |date=June 12, 2018 |accessdate=June 13, 2018 |archivedate=June 13, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some larger Pok√©mon can also be ridden, a mechanic first seen in [[Pok√©mon X and Y|''Pok√©mon X'' and ''Y'']] and later refined in ''Sun and Moon''. The eight Gym Leaders and the members of Elite Four from the original game also appear, as well as the antagonist faction Team Rocket, including Jessie, James and Meowth from the anime series.

A notable feature in ''Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'' is that wild Pok√©mon show up in the overworld, rather than as random encounters in grass or caves like in previous main-series ''Pok√©mon'' RPGs. To start a battle, the player has to simply interact with a Pok√©mon in the environment. The battle screen is reminiscent of ''Pok√©mon Go'', with the use of berries to pacify a Pok√©mon and the toss of a Pok√© Ball to capture it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/14/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-e3-impressions |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619050942/https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/14/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-e3-impressions |archive-date = June 19, 2018 |title='Pok√©mon: Let's Go, Pikachu!' doesn't feel like a remake |website=[[Engadget]] |last=Souppouris |first=Aaron |date=June 14, 2018 |accessdate=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pok√©mon evolution|evolution]] mechanic from previous games returns in ''Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!''; however, the player's starting Pikachu or Eevee cannot evolve, like ''Pok√©mon Yellow''. Only other Pok√©mon that the player has caught can evolve, including the ones of the same species of the partner Pok√©mon. Some features, like [[Pok√©mon breeding]] and [[HM (Pok√©mon)|HMs]], are absent from the games.&lt;ref name="GameSpot post-E3 2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-eevee-everything-we-know-s/1100-6459253|title=Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu, Eevee: Everything We Know So Far|last=Plagge|first=Kallie|date=June 12, 2018|website=[[GameSpot]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613205331/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-eevee-everything-we-know-s/1100-6459253|archivedate=June 13, 2018|deadurl=no|accessdate=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ''Pok√©mon X'' and ''Y'', [[experience point]]s are rewarded to Pok√©mon not only by defeating opponent Pok√©mon but also by catching wild Pok√©mon. However, in ''Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'' experience points rewarded by catching wild Pok√©mon are affected by various multiplier bonuses depending on the timing of the throw and the technique used to throw the Pok√© Ball, such as performing an overarm or underarm throw. The game also introduces new items called "candies," which are used to power up a Pok√©mon's statistics, such as [[Health (gaming)|HP]], Attack, Defense, Sp. Attack, Sp. Defense, and Speed. Different types of candy are awarded to players who transfer their Pok√©mon to [[Professor Oak]] via an in-game storage box. "Combat Power" (CP) also returns from ''Pok√©mon Go''.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer post-E3 2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN post-E3 2018"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nordic.ign.com/switch/15916/news/e3-2018-new-pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-and-eevee-gameplay-detai |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619061737/http://nordic.ign.com/switch/15916/news/e3-2018-new-pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-and-eevee-gameplay-detai |title=E3 2018: New Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee Gameplay Details |last=Osborn |first=Alex |website=[[IGN]] |date=June 12, 2018 |accessdate=June 19, 2018 |archivedate=June 19, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players can also trade Pok√©mon and battle other players both locally and online, with said online features being simplified in comparison with previous games. Some features‚Äîincluding the Global Trade System, Wonder Trade, and Battle Spot‚Äîare absent from ''Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!''. To connect with other players to trade online, players use a code made out of the names of three freely-selected Pok√©mon which, when two players enter the same code, allow them to trade Pok√©mon with or battle each other.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer post-E3 2018" /&gt; A subscription to the [[Nintendo Switch#Online services|Nintendo Switch Online]] service is required to trade and battle online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/pokemon-lets-go-online-functionality-requires-paid-nintendo-online-account|title=Pokemon Let's Go Online Functionality Requires Paid Nintendo Online Account|last=Oxford|first=Nadia|date=June 6, 2018|website=US Gamer|access-date=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players can also transfer the original first-generation Pok√©mon and their respective Alolan forms from ''Pok√©mon Go'' to ''Let's Go, Pikachu!'' or ''Let's Go, Eevee!''. They then appear at the Go Park; an in-game location that the player can explore where they can interact or catch Pok√©mon that are walking around, although Pok√©mon with higher CP or levels are harder to catch, in that the catch attempt has a higher chance of failing.&lt;ref name="IGN post-E3 2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GameSpot post-E3 2018" /&gt; Users are also able to exchange unspecified "gifts" between ''Pok√©mon Go'' and ''Let's Go, Pikachu!'' or ''Let's Go, Eevee!''.&lt;ref name="announcement" /&gt;

The games support an optional controller, the Pok√© Ball Plus. It is shaped like a Pok√© Ball and features an [[analog stick]], motion control support, [[HD Rumble]] feedback, and lighting effects. The analog stick doubles as a capture button in case the player does not wish to use the motion controls. During Nintendo's E3 2018 [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation on June 12, 2018, it was revealed that the Pok√© Ball Plus would come with a [[Mew (Pok√©mon)|Mew]] that can be transferred to the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/06/12/pokemon-lets-go-mew-pokeball|title=Nintendo Puts Mew in Every PokeBall Plus for Pokemon: Let's Go|website=[[Comic Book (website)|Comic Book]] ''(''WWG'')''|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pokeballplus.nintendo.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619050159/https://pokeballplus.nintendo.com/ |title=Pok√© Ball‚Ñ¢ Plus |website=pokeballplus.nintendo.com |publisher=[[Nintendo of America]] |accessdate=June 19, 2018 |archivedate=June 19, 2018 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;Although ''Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'' feature integration with ''Pok√©mon Go'', this is optional.&lt;ref name="GameSpot post-E3 2018" /&gt;

== Development ==
''Pok√©mon: Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'' were unveiled during a press conference in Japan on May 30, 2018. They are primarily aimed toward a younger audience and those who are new to the ''Pok√©mon'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17406032/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-lets-go-eevee-switch-game-freak |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530041804/https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17406032/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-lets-go-eevee-switch-game-freak |title=Two new Pokemon RPGs are coming to the Switch this November |last=Farokhmanesh |first=Megan |website=[[The Verge]] |date=May 29, 2018 |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |archivedate=May 30, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Verge"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17380526/pokemon-switch-2019-core-rpg-nintendo |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530042153/https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17380526/pokemon-switch-2019-core-rpg-nintendo |title=Another Pok√©mon game is still coming in 2019 |last=Farokhmanesh |first=Megan |website=[[The Verge]] |date=May 29, 2018 |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |archivedate=May 30, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of announcement game director [[Junichi Masuda]] mentioned that the games have been in development for around two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everything-we-know-about-pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-a/1100-6459253/|title=Everything We Know About Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu And Eevee|last=Plagge|first=Kallie|date=June 29, 2018|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Junichi Masuda also stated that he considered the games to be remakes of ''Pok√©mon Yellow'', explaining that ''Yellow'' "resonated" best with younger players because it incorporated elements from the [[Pok√©mon (anime)|''Pok√©mon'' anime television series]].&lt;ref name="Polygon" /&gt;

Although they are the first main series ''Pok√©mon'' role-playing games for the [[Nintendo Switch]], ''Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'' are a separate project from the ''Pok√©mon'' game on the same platform that was teased during Nintendo's [[E3 2017]] Nintendo Direct on June 13, 2017 presentation which is scheduled to be released in "late 2019."&lt;ref name="transfer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switchs-first-alternative-joy-con-is-a-po/1100-6459252|title=Nintendo Switch's First Alternative Joy-Con Is A Poke Ball|last=Plagge|first=Kallie|date=May 29, 2018|website=[[GameSpot]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530040953/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switchs-first-alternative-joy-con-is-a-po/1100-6459252|archivedate=May 30, 2018|deadurl=no|accessdate=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Verge" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/30/core-pokemon-rpg-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530040544/http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/30/core-pokemon-rpg-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2019 |title=Core Pokemon RPG Coming to Nintendo Switch 2019 |last=DeFreitas |first=Casey |date=May 29, 2018 |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |archivedate=May 30, 2018 |website=[[IGN]] |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masuda stated that he decided to make Eevee the mascot of the second game due to its popularity and abundance of [[fan art]]. He had previously considered [[Psyduck]] but ultimately changed his mind, stating that it was due to Psyduck being the same color as Pikachu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/30/17384582/pokemon-lets-go-eevee-pikachu-fan-art-nintendo-switch |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530231413/https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/30/17384582/pokemon-lets-go-eevee-pikachu-fan-art-nintendo-switch |title=Eevee's starring role in Pok√©mon: Let's Go was inspired by fan art |last=Farokhmanesh |first=Megan |website=[[The Verge]] |date=May 30, 2018 |accessdate=May 31, 2018 |archivedate=May 30, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Posterior cerebral artery syndrome''' is a condition whereby the blood supply from the [[posterior cerebral artery]] (PCA) is restricted, leading to a reduction of the function of the portions of the [[brain]] supplied by that vessel: the [[occipital lobe]], the inferomedial [[temporal lobe]], a large portion of the [[thalamus]], and the upper [[brainstem]] and [[midbrain]].&lt;ref name= "O'Sullivan" /&gt;

This event restricts the flow of blood to the brain in a near-immediate fashion. The blood hammer is analogous to the water hammer in hydrology and it consists of a sudden increase of the upstream blood pressure in a blood vessel when the bloodstream is abruptly blocked by vessel obstruction. Complete understanding of the relationship between mechanical parameters in vascular occlusions is a critical issue, which can play an important role in the future diagnosis, understanding and treatment of vascular diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tazraei|first1=P.|last2=Riasi|first2=A.|last3=Takabi|first3=B.|title=The influence of the non-Newtonian properties of blood on blood-hammer through the posterior cerebral artery|journal=Mathematical Biosciences|date=2015|volume=264|pages=119‚Äì127|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556415000802|doi=10.1016/j.mbs.2015.03.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending upon the location and severity of the occlusion, signs and symptoms may vary within the population affected with PCA syndrome. Blockages of the proximal portion of the vessel produce only minor deficits due to the collateral blood flow from the opposite hemisphere via the [[posterior communicating artery]].  In contrast, distal occlusions result in more serious complications. Visual deficits, such as [[agnosia]], [[prosopagnosia]] or [[cortical blindness]] (with bilateral infarcts) may be a product of ischemic damage to [[occipital lobe]]. Occlusions of the branches of the PCA that supply the thalamus can result in [[central post-stroke pain]] and lesions to the subthalamic branches can produce ‚Äúa wide variety of deficits‚Äù.&lt;ref name= "O'Sullivan" /&gt;
 
Left posterior cerebral artery syndrome presents alexia without agraphia; the lesion is in the splenium of the corpus callosum.

==Life and career==
Brooks was born in  [[St Pancras, London|Pancras, London]], the elder son of [[Shirley Brooks]], the satirical writer and editor of ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'',&lt;ref name="Stiff Upper Lips and Baggy Green Caps"&gt;{{cite book|last=Briggs|first=Simon|title=Stiff Upper Lips and Baggy Green Caps: A Sledger's History of the Ashes|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=jRpIZuqxejAC&amp;pg=PT19&amp;lpg=PT19&amp;dq=%22Reginald+Shirley+Brooks%22+son&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9xPrs3k2i-&amp;sig=g6de9B_IAAQca0Arr7uC4NMb0fs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7KqbVdrmDKe7mwWW2bXQDQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Reginald%20Shirley%20Brooks%22%20son&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 July 2015|date=1 September 2009|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|isbn=9781743513798}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/jun/11/ashes-origins-england-australia|title=Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, if Shirley can't further the cause his son must|last=[[Mike Selvey]]|date=11 June 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Emily Walkinshaw Brooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://search.ancestry.co.uk/cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv=1&amp;db=freebmdbirth&amp;gss=angs-d&amp;new=1&amp;rank=1&amp;msT=1&amp;gsfn=reginald+shirley+walkinshaw+&amp;gsln=brooks&amp;MSAV=1&amp;msbdy=1854&amp;msddy=1888&amp;cpxt=1&amp;cp=11&amp;catbucket=rstp&amp;uidh=j8v&amp;pcat=34&amp;fh=0&amp;h=34333300&amp;recoff=7+8+9+10&amp;ml_rpos=1 | title = Birth Certificate | publisher = www.ancestry.co.uk | accessdate = 9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks' father died in 1874; Reginald Shirley Brooks collated some of his father's satirical writing for ''Punch'' about a pompous middle-class couple called ''The Naggletons'' into book form and it was published the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = The Naggletons | newspaper = Morning Post/British Newspaper Archive | subscription = yes | page = 7 | location = London | date = 28 December 1875}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further volume of his father's epigrammatic verses was published under the title of ''Wit and Humour'' and reviewed in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = The Reader column | newspaper = The Graphic/British Newspaper Archive | subscription = yes | page = 21 | location = London | date = 12 January 1884 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks became a writer and journalist himself, joining ''[[The Sporting Times]]'' no later than 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rintoul|first=M.C.|title=Dictionary of Real People and Places in Fiction|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OxcCAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=Reginald+Shirley+Brooks&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O8eeVenZD6qX7Qas5q6YBw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Reginald%20Shirley%20Brooks&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 July 2015|date=15 August 2014|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9780415867658}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote under the pen-name "Peter Blobbs"; the newspaper, known as the "Pink Un", covered sports in general but particularly horse-racing, and also dealt in society gossip. In 1880 he was announced as the launch editor for ''The Sketch'', a weekly magazine of society news, though the launch did not then happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Literary and Art Gossip | newspaper = The Leeds Mercury/British Newspaper Archive | subscription = yes | page = 6 | location = Leeds | date = 7 January 1880}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1880 to 1884 he wrote for ''Punch''. According to a history of the magazine published in 1895: "He wrote some smart papers, but his groove was not that of the sober and respectable [[Fleet Street]] Sage. He preferred wilder spirits, and he accordingly retired, taking with him the sympathy of his companions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Spielman|first = M.H.|title = The History of "Punch"|url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/23881/23881-h/23881-h.htm|accessdate = 12 July 2015|date = 1895|publisher = [[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell]]|page = 387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was while writing for ''The Sporting Times'' in 1882 that Brooks published a spoof [[obituary]] of English cricket, following the [[England cricket team|England side's]] defeat in a [[Test cricket|Test match]] against [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]]. His mild satire resulted in subsequent cricket series between Australia and England becoming known as "[[The Ashes]]".&lt;ref name="The Daily Telegraph - 23 July 2009 - The Ashes: What are the origins of the England-Australia rivalry?"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/theashes/5893794/The-Ashes-What-are-the-origins-of-the-England-Australia-rivalry.html|title=The Ashes: What are the origins of the England-Australia rivalry?|date=23 July 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Mike Selvey]], besides the chance to be amusing Brooks had a more serious motive in writing his "obituary". At the time, [[cremation]] was still unlawful. Brooks' father had been a member of the [[Cremation Society of Great Britain]], which was campaigning to have it made legal. When his father died in 1874, Brooks was unable to have him cremated as he would have wished. However, eight years later he was able to give publicity to the cause through what he wrote.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt; A reference work on cremation states: "Cremation was the butt of many, usually very unwitty, jokes, and the obituary was at least as much a joke about cremation as about English cricket."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Douglas James Davies and Lewis H. Mates (eds) | title = Encyclopedia of Cremation | edition = 2005 | publisher = Ashgate | ISBN = 9781409423171 | page = 397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks ‚Äì and the ''Sporting Times'' as a whole ‚Äì had in any case a reputation as something of a joker. A story retold in a book of 1898 by one of the other journalists of Brooks' time recounts an incident when the newspaper was three columns short at the time of going to press "and nobody was sober enough to attempt the task of writing them"; Brooks solved the problem by reprinting an entire article from the magazine ''[[Truth (British periodical)|Truth]]'', merely adding the headline: "How on Earth Did this Story get into the Columns of ''Truth''?"&lt;ref name=Binstead&gt;{{cite book| last = Binstead | first = Arthur | title = A Pink 'Un and a Pelican | url = https://archive.org/details/pinkunandpelican00bins | pages = 38‚Äì42 | publisher = Bliss Sands &amp; Co. | date = 1898 | accessdate = 13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the publication of the memoirs of the theatrical impresario [[John Hollingshead]] in 1895, another journalist recounted an incident in which he and Brooks had successfully conned theatre tickets from Hollingshead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = A Theatrical Reminiscence| newspaper = Nottingham Evening Post/British Newspaper Archive | subscription = yes | page = 2 | location = Nottingham | date = 25 June 1895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Brooks' witticisms misfired. In 1886, the French actor/manager Marius was in charge of the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire Theatre]], which was owned by the [[Caf√© Royal]], and reacted badly when Brooks, in a review of a play at the Empire for a magazine called ''The Bat'', suggested the Caf√© Royal might have done better to employ Marius in his former profession of a waiter, rather than as a theatre manager. Marius claimed never to have been a waiter and sued for libel; Brooks took to the witness stand but the case was lost and Marius received ¬£100 damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = A Theatrical Libel| newspaper = Reynolds's Newspaper/British Newspaper Archive | subscription = yes | page = 6 | location = London | date = 12 December 1886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks' lifestyle meant that he was not a "morning person". According to a servant at the hotel in [[Covent Garden]] where he was a long-term resident, when asked what time he had breakfast: "Breakfast! He don't trouble no breakfast, but he's gener'ly sick about har' past eleven or a quarter to twelve!"&lt;ref name = Binstead/&gt;

In his novel ''[[Summer Lightning]]'', first published in 1929, [[P. G. Wodehouse]] invented a dissolute past for the character [[Galahad Threepwood]], in the course of which Brooks is mentioned. In his younger days Galahad had been "a brother-in-arms of the Shifter, the Pitcher, Peter Blobbs and the rest of an interesting but not strait-laced circle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Massingberd|first = Hugh|title = Noblemen who have gone wrong |url = http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/18th-december-1993/74/noblemen-who-have-gone-wrong|accessdate = 7 July 2015|date = 18 December 1993|work = [[The Spectator]]|page = 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than six years after his spoof obituary for English cricket was published, Brooks himself had died in London at the early age of 33.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Har02Typo-t1-g1-t7-body-d38.html |title=Typo: A Monthly Newspaper and Literary Review, Volume 2
|publisher=Robert Coupland Harding |date=28 July 1888 |accessdate=7 July 2015 |location=Napier, New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like his father before him, he was buried at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].&lt;ref name  = Binstead/&gt; He had been suffering from [[tuberculosis]] and [[rheumatism]], which had latterly prevented him from working. Obituaries said that his byline on the ''Sporting Times'' of Peter Blobbs was known all over the world, and in spite of his having led a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] lifestyle, "Few men could get through more work in less time, and its quality was invariably good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=WH18880714.2.5 |title=Wanganui Herald |publisher=Wanganui Herald |date=14 July 1888 |accessdate=7 July 2015 |location=Wanganui, New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; An obituary in the society magazine ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' (reprinted in the ''Sheffield Evening Telegraph'') wrote that he had inherited "much of the literary ability of his father" and was "endowed with a keen and very original sense of humour that was entirely his own".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Vanities | newspaper = Sheffield Evening Telegraph/British Newspaper Archive | subscription = yes | page = 2 | location = Sheffield | date = 14 May 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Briggs summed him up less charitably as "a stereotypical boozy hack who chased actresses, gambled recklessly and drank himself to an early grave".&lt;ref name="Stiff Upper Lips and Baggy Green Caps"/&gt; According to a colleague on the ''Sporting Times'': "Shirley had a sweet and gentle disposition that caused him to be beloved by everybody, nor did any of the petty ironies of life disturb him in the least." Ten years after his death, his former room when visiting the country residence that belonged to John Corlett, the paper's proprietor and editor, was still preserved as he had left it, with his photographs, pictures and sketches adorning the walls.&lt;ref name = Binstead/&gt;

'''K-141 ''Kursk''''' ({{lang-ru| –ê—Ç–æ–º–Ω–∞—è –ü–æ–¥–≤–æ–¥–Ω–∞—è –õ–æ–¥–∫–∞ ¬´–ö—É—Ä—Å–∫¬ª (–ê–ü–õ ¬´–ö—É—Ä—Å–∫¬ª)}}, [[Romanization of Russian|transl]]. {{transl|ru|Atomnaya Podvodnaya Lodka "Kursk" (APL "Kursk")}}, meaning "Nuclear-powered submarine ''Kursk''") was an [[Oscar class submarine|Oscar II]]-class nuclear-powered cruise-missile [[submarine]] of the [[Russian Navy]].

On 12 August 2000, K-141 ''Kursk'' was [[Kursk submarine disaster|lost when it sank]] in the [[Barents Sea]], killing all 118 personnel on board.

== Construction ==
K-141 ''Kursk'' was a Project 949A class ''Antey'' ({{lang-ru|A–Ω—Ç–µ–π, meaning [[Antaeus]]}}) submarine of the [[Oscar class|Oscar-class]], known as the Oscar II by its [[NATO reporting name]], and was the penultimate submarine of the Oscar II class designed and approved in the [[Soviet Union]]. Construction began in 1990 at the [[Soviet Navy]] military shipyards in [[Severodvinsk]], near [[Arkhangelsk]], in the northern [[Russian SFSR]]. During the construction of K-141, the [[Soviet Union collapse]]d; work continued, and she became one of the first naval vessels completed after the collapse. K-141 was inherited by [[Russia]] and launched in 1994, before being commissioned by the [[Russian Navy]] on December 30, as part of the [[Russian Northern Fleet]].&lt;ref name=potts/&gt; K-141 was named ''Kursk'' after [[Kursk|the city]], following the [[naming system]] for  Soviet submarines.

''Kursk'' was assigned to the [[home port]] of [[Vidyayevo]], [[Murmansk Oblast]].

== Capabilities ==

The Antey design represented the highest achievement of Soviet nuclear submarine technology. They were the second-largest attack submarines ever built, after the Typhoon Class submarine (Akula /Project 941).&lt;ref name=barany/&gt;{{rp|22‚Äì23}} It was built to defeat an entire United States aircraft carrier group. A single [[Type 65 torpedo]] carried a {{convert|450|kg|abbr=on}} warhead powerful enough to sink an aircraft carrier.&lt;ref name=weaponsystems&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weaponsystems.net/weapon.php?weapon=HH14%20-%20Type%2065 |title=Weapon |publisher=Weaponsystems.net |accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both missiles and torpedoes could be equipped with nuclear warheads. She was {{convert|30|ft|abbr=on|order=flip}} longer than the preceding Oscar I-class of submarines. The senior officers had individual staterooms and the entire crew had access to a gymnasium.&lt;ref name=cns&gt;{{cite web|title=Kursk Stats|url=http://cns.miis.edu/archive/rus_sub/kurstats.htm|date=11 February 2014|accessdate=11 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222153914/http://cns.miis.edu/archive/rus_sub/kurstats.htm|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore|first=Robert|title=A Time to Die 0|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/book/116819/a-time-to-die-by-robert-moore/9780609610008/?view=excerpt|publisher=Random House|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outer hull, made of high-[[nickel]], high-[[chromium]] [[stainless steel]] {{convert|8.5|mm|abbr=on}} thick, had exceptionally good resistance to corrosion and a weak [[magnetic]] signature which helped prevent detection by U.S. [[magnetic anomaly detector]] (MAD) systems.

== Naval exercise and disaster ==
{{main article|Kursk submarine disaster}}

''Kursk'' joined the "Summer-X" exercise, the first large-scale naval exercise planned by the Russian Navy in more than a decade,&lt;ref name=nucnews818&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian Sub Has 'Terrifying Hole'|url=http://nucnews.net/nucnews/2000nn/0008nn/000818nn.htm|accessdate=31 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101161935/http://nucnews.net/nucnews/2000nn/0008nn/000818nn.htm|archivedate=1 January 2011|date=18 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 10 August 2000. It included 30 ships including the fleet's flagship [[Russian battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy|''Pyotr Velikiy'']] ("Peter the Great"), four attack submarines,&lt;ref name=potts&gt;{{cite web|last=Potts|first=J.R.|title=K-141 Kursk Attack Submarine (1994)|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/ships/detail.asp?ship_id=K141-Kursk|publisher=militaryfactory.com|accessdate=3 February 2014|date=5 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220231704/http://www.militaryfactory.com/ships/detail.asp?ship_id=K141-Kursk|archivedate=20 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a flotilla of smaller ships.

It was one of the few ships authorized to carry a combat load at all times.

=== Explosion ===

On the first day of the exercise, ''Kursk'' successfully launched a Granit missile armed with a dummy warhead.&lt;ref name=potts/&gt;  Two days later, on the morning of 12 August, ''Kursk'' prepared to fire [[dummy torpedo]]es at the [[Kirov class battlecruiser|''Kirov''-class battlecruiser]] [[Pyotr Velikiy]] (''Peter The Great''). These practice torpedoes had no explosive warheads and were manufactured and tested at a much lower quality standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Dikkenberg | first = John | title = Raising the Kursk | newspaper = Sydney Morning Herald |publisher = Newspaper Source Plus | date = 19 October 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 August 2000, at 11:28 local time (07:28 [[UTC]]), there was an explosion while preparing to fire.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Debra, ''et al''. "A Mystery In The Deep." ''Newsweek'' 136.9 (2000): 34. Academic Search Premier. Web. 7 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Navy's final report on the disaster concluded the explosion was due to the failure of one of ''Kursk'''s hydrogen peroxide-fueled [[Type 65 torpedo]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Sviatov, George. "The Kursk's Loss Offers Lessons." ''U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings'', 129.6 (2003): 71. Academic Search Premier. Web. 7 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent investigation concluded that [[high-test peroxide]] (HTP), a form of highly concentrated [[hydrogen peroxide]] used as propellant for the torpedo, seeped through a faulty weld in the torpedo casing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Marshall | first = Geoff | title = The Loss of the HMS Sidon | newspaper = In Depth | publisher = Submarines Association Australia | date = July 2008 | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | url = http://submarinesaustralia.com/indepth_archive/in_depth__jul_08.html | accessdate = 2 September 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110216055128/http://submarinesaustralia.com/indepth_archive/in_depth__jul_08.html | archivedate = 16 February 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When HTP comes in contact with a catalyst, it rapidly expands by a factor of 5000, generating vast quantities of steam and oxygen. The pressure produced by the expanding HTP ruptured the kerosene fuel tank in the torpedo and set off an explosion equal to {{convert|100|‚Äì|250|kg}} of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]]. The submarine sank in relatively shallow water, bottoming at {{convert|108|m|ft}} about {{convert|135|km|abbr=on}} off [[Severomorsk]], at {{Coord|69|40|N|37|35|E}}. A second explosion 135 seconds after the initial event was equivalent to 3-7 tons of TNT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/umrcourses/ge342/Forensic%20Seismology-revised.pdf |work=[[Missouri University of Science and Technology]]|title=Some Practical Applications of Forensic Seismology |format=PDF|first1=J. David|last1=Rogers|first2=Keith D.|last2=Koper |accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explosions blew a large hole in the hull and collapsed the first three compartments of the sub, killing or incapacitating all but 23 of the 118 personnel on board.&lt;ref name="underwood"/&gt;{{rp|208}}

=== Rescue attempts ===
Though the [[Royal Navy|British]] and [[Norwegian Navy|Norwegian]] navies offered assistance, Russia initially refused all help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams |first1=Daniel |title='Terrifying Hole' in Russian Sub |url=http://nucnews.net/nucnews/2000nn/0008nn/000818nn.htm |website=Wayback Machine |publisher=Washington Post |accessdate=2 April 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101161935/http://nucnews.net/nucnews/2000nn/0008nn/000818nn.htm |archivedate=1 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All 118 sailors and officers aboard ''Kursk'' died. The Russian Admiralty initially told the public that the majority of the crew died within minutes of the explosion, but on 21 August, Norwegian and Russian divers found 24 bodies in the ninth compartment, the turbine room at the stern of the boat. Captain-lieutenant Dmitri Kolesnikov wrote a note listing the names of 23 sailors who were alive in the compartment after the ship sank.

''Kursk'' carried a [[potassium superoxide]] cartridge of a [[chemical oxygen generator]], used to absorb [[carbon dioxide]] and chemically release oxygen during an emergency. However, the cartridge became contaminated with sea water and the resulting chemical reaction caused a flash fire which consumed the available oxygen. The investigation showed that some men temporarily survived the fire by plunging under water, as fire marks on the bulkheads indicated the water was at waist level at the time. Ultimately, the remaining crew burned to death or suffocated.&lt;ref name="RM"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Robert|title=A Time to Die‚ÄìThe Untold Story of the Kursk Tragedy|publisher=Crown Publishers, Random House|location=New York|year=2003|pages=65‚Äì66|isbn=0-609-61000-7|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=917851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], though immediately informed of the tragedy, was told by the navy that they had the situation under control and rescue was imminent. He waited five days before he ended his [[holiday]] at a presidential resort in [[Sochi]] on the Black Sea. Only four months into his tenure as President, the public and media were extremely critical of Putin's decision to remain at a seaside resort, and his highly favourable ratings dropped dramatically.&lt;ref name=bbc3107&gt;{{cite news|title=Kursk closure leaves questions unanswered|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2164783.stm|accessdate=1 February 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=31 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The President's response appeared callous and the government's actions looked incompetent.&lt;ref name=sptimes&gt;{{cite news|title=Kursk Relatives Make a Plea for Facts and Justice|url=http://www.sptimesrussia.com/story/14499|accessdate=21 February 2011|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=23 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later he said, "I probably should have returned to Moscow, but nothing would have changed. I had the same level of communication both in Sochi and in Moscow, but from a PR point of view I could have demonstrated some special eagerness to return."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1487112.stm  ''Spectre of Kursk haunts Putin'']  ‚Äì BBC News, 12 August 2001 Retrieved on 8 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Submarine recovery==
[[File:Kursk wreck.jpg|thumb|Submarine wreck after the disaster]]

A consortium formed by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] companies [[Mammoet]] and [[Smit International]]&lt;ref&gt;Smit website on [http://www.smit.com/sitefactor/page.asp?pageid=148 Salvage project of Kursk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121000847/http://www.smit.com/sitefactor/page.asp?pageid=148 |date=21 January 2012 }}, URL visited 12 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; was awarded a contract by Russia to raise the vessel, excluding the bow. They modified the barge ''[[Giant 4]]'' which raised ''Kursk'' and recovered the remains of the sailors.&lt;ref name="Spitz, 2006"&gt;{{citation|last=Spitz|first=D.J.|title=Investigation of Bodies in Water.

Guideline for the Application of Pathology to Crime Investigations |edition=4th|publisher=|location= Springfield, Illinois.|year=2006|pages=846‚Äì881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During salvage in 2001, the team first cut the bow off the hull using a [[tungsten carbide]]-studded cable. As this tool had the potential to cause sparks which could ignite remaining pockets of reactive gases, such as hydrogen, the operation was carefully executed. Most of the bow was abandoned and the rest of the vessel was towed to Severomorsk and placed in a floating dry dock for analysis.

The remains of ''Kursk''{{'}}s reactor compartment was towed to Sayda Bay on Russia's northern [[Kola Peninsula]] ‚Äì where more than 50 reactor compartments were afloat at pier points ‚Äì after a shipyard had defuelled the boat in early 2003.&lt;ref name="bellona"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kudrik|first=Igor|title=Defuelled Kursk will join submarine graveyard|url=http://www.bellona.org/english_import_area/international/russia/navy/northern_fleet/incidents/28703|publisher=Bellona Foundation|location=Oslo|date=3 March 2003|accessdate=8 August 2007

Some torpedo and torpedo tube fragments from the bow were recovered and the rest was destroyed by explosives in 2002.

==Official inquiry results==
Notwithstanding the navy's oft-stated position that a collision with a foreign vessel had triggered the event, a report issued by the government attributed the disaster to a torpedo explosion caused when [[high-test peroxide]] (HTP), a form of highly concentrated [[hydrogen peroxide]], leaked from a faulty weld in the torpedo's casing.&lt;ref name="weaponsystems"/&gt;&lt;ref name=brannon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tony DiGiulian |url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WTRussian_post-WWII.htm |title=Russia / USSR Post-World War II Torpedoes |publisher=Navweaps.com |date=19 November 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report found that the initial explosion destroyed the torpedo room compartment and killed everyone in the first compartment.&lt;ref name=bbc0107&gt;{{cite news|title=Final report blames fuel for Kursk disaster|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2078927.stm|accessdate=1 February 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=1 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inquests2187&gt;{{cite web|last=–ú–∏–ª–∞—à–∏–Ω–∞|first=–ï–ª–µ–Ω–∞|script-title=ru:–ö–∞–∫ –ø–æ–≥–∏–± –ö—É—Ä—Å–∫|url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/inquests2187.html|accessdate=14 February 2014|date=15 July 2010 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blast entered the second and perhaps the third and fourth compartments through an air conditioning vent.

=== Alternative explanation ===
Vice-Admiral Valery Ryazantsev differed with the government's official conclusion. He cited inadequate training, poor maintenance, and incomplete inspections that caused the crew to mishandle the weapon.&lt;ref name=Ryazantsevix&gt;{{cite web| first=Valery |last=Ryazantsev |title=The death of the "Kursk"|url=http://www.avtonomka.org/vospominaniya/vitse-admiral-ryazantsev-valeriy-dmitrievich/45-glava-ix-spasatelnaya-operatsiya.html|accessdate=12 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613060146/http://www.avtonomka.org/vospominaniya/vitse-admiral-ryazantsev-valeriy-dmitrievich/45-glava-ix-spasatelnaya-operatsiya.html |archivedate= 13 June 2011 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the examination of the wrecked sub, investigators recovered a partially burned copy of the safety instructions for loading HTP torpedoes, but the instructions were for a significantly different type of torpedo and failed to include essential steps for testing an air valve. The 7th Division, 1st Submarine Flotilla never inspected ''Kursk''{{'}}s crew's qualifications and readiness to fire HTP torpedoes.&lt;ref name="inquests2187"/&gt; ''Kursk''{{'}}s crew had no prior experience with HTP-powered torpedoes and had not been trained in handling or firing HTP-powered torpedoes. Due to their inexperience and lack of training, compounded by incomplete inspections and oversight, and because the  ''Kursk''{{'}}s crew followed faulty instructions when loading the practice torpedo, Ryazantsev believes they set off a chain of events that led to the explosion.&lt;ref name="barany"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ryazantsevvii &gt;{{cite web| first=Valery |last=Ryazantsev |title=The death of the "Kursk"|url=http://avtonomka.org/vospominaniya/vitse-admiral-ryazantsev-valeriy-dmitrievich/43-glava-vii-gibel-kurska-kak-eto-bilo.html|accessdate=12 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120181513/http://avtonomka.org/vospominaniya/vitse-admiral-ryazantsev-valeriy-dmitrievich/43-glava-vii-gibel-kurska-kak-eto-bilo.html |archivedate= 20 November 2011 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&amp;pg=PA153 153]&lt;/ref&gt; He was Zahir's eldest son and generally known to be his most loyal son. However, he did join his brothers Uthman, Ahmad and Sa'id in a rebellion against their father, in which they were defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Joudah, 1987, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Salibi led a contingent of Zahir's troops to support [[Ali Bey al-Kabir]]'s bid to regain control of [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]] from [[Abu al-Dhahab]]. However, Salibi and Ali Bey's troops were decisively defeated and Salibi was killed in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N78KAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Sulaybi+Zahir&amp;dq=Sulaybi+Zahir&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMIysX-w_7vxgIVQZyACh1LEwAg|title=Middle East Forum|volume=48|publisher=Alumni Association of the American University of Beirut|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zahir was distressed by the death of his son and upon hearing the news, he collapsed to the ground and exclaimed "From this day I am undone".&lt;ref&gt;Sabbagh, 2008, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8CAzGKXK6acC&amp;pg=PP22 41]&lt;/ref&gt; Salibi was succeeded by his brother Ahmad al-Zahir as ''multazem'' of Tiberias.&lt;ref&gt;Joudah, 1987, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scott John Hutchison''' (20 November 1981 ‚Äì {{c.}}{{nbsp}}10 May 2018) was a Scottish singer, songwriter, guitarist and artist. He was the founding member and primary songwriter of the [[indie rock]] band [[Frightened Rabbit]], with whom he recorded five studio albums, and created the artwork for each release.&lt;ref name="Metro Lewis"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=John|title=We were never cold enough to be art school|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/02/07/frightened-rabbits-scott-hutchison-we-were-never-cold-or-germanic-enough-to-be-art-school-3383630|accessdate=21 October 2013|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutchison was also a member of the musical collective [[The Fruit Tree Foundation]], and released one solo album under the moniker Owl John. His last musical project was the indie "supergroup" [[Mastersystem]], featuring Frightened Rabbit bandmate and brother Grant alongside members of [[Editors (band)|Editors]] and [[Minor Victories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Trendell |title=Meet Mastersystem ‚Äì the 'gnarly' new supergroup from Editors, Frightened Rabbit and Minor Victories |url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/mastersystem-editors-frightened-rabbit-supergroup-album-dance-music-tour-interview-2247687 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=12 May 2018 |date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutchison studied [[illustration]] at the [[Glasgow School of Art]], before forming Frightened Rabbit in 2003. Initially a solo project, Hutchison collaborated with his brother [[Grant Hutchison|Grant]] on the band's debut album, ''[[Sing the Greys]]'' (2006), and recorded the band's critical breakthrough, ''[[The Midnight Organ Fight]]'' (2008), as a three-piece, following the collapse of a romantic relationship.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coscarelli|first1=Joe|title=Scott Hutchison, Frightened Rabbit Singer, Is Found Dead at 36|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/11/arts/music/scott-hutchison-frightened-rabbit-dead.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=12 May 2018|date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the album's release, the band's fanbase expanded significantly and a third studio album, ''[[The Winter of Mixed Drinks]]'', was released in 2010. Signing to [[Atlantic Records]], the band released their fourth studio album, ''[[Pedestrian Verse]]'', in 2013. The following year, Hutchison recorded a solo album as Owl John. In 2016, the band released their fifth studio album, ''[[Painting of a Panic Attack]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Luke |last=Morgan Britton |title=Frightened Rabbit announce new album and share track 'Death Dream'|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/frightened-rabbit-3-1199089|website=NME|accessdate=12 May 2018|date=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutchison disappeared on 9 May 2018, and his body was found the following day on the banks of the [[Firth of Forth]].&lt;ref name="BBC confirmation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/music/frightened-rabbit-singer-scott-hutchison-dead-age-36|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|first=Dave|last=Quinn|date=11 May 2018|access-date=11 May 2018|title=Frightened Rabbit Singer Scott Hutchison Found Dead at 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p4kd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frightened Rabbit's Scott Hutchison Dead at 36|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/body-found-in-search-for-frightened-rabbits-scott-hutchison|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|accessdate=11 May 2018|first1=Matthew|last1=Strauss|first2=Jazz|last2=Monroe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Childhood and early life===
Scott John Hutchison, described by his mother as a shy child, was born and raised in the [[Scottish Borders]] town of [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]], with his brother Grant.&lt;ref name=dirty/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/scott-hutchison-slccltclq Obituary: Scott Hutchison] thetimes.co.uk accessdate 10 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Moving to the city of [[Glasgow]], he studied [[illustration]] at the [[Glasgow School of Art]]: "I was there for four years and I didn't particularly want to be an illustrator, so I wanted to apply the rules that I learnt to everything I do, in terms of working in a bank or writing music."&lt;ref name=dirty&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dirtyzine.co.uk/content/view/528/39/|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081006060425/http://www.dirtyzine.co.uk/content/view/528/39/|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 6 October 2008|title=Interview: Scott Hutchison|work=Dirty Zine|last=Sharp |first=Craig |date=8 July 2007|accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While living in Glasgow, he worked in a specialist [[whisky]] shop in the residential area of [[Hyndland]], noting: "I began to appreciate and admire the heritage of flavour in a [[dram (unit)|dram]] of [[Single malt whisky|single malt]]."&lt;ref name="qwhisky"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qthemusic.com/articles/column/guest-column-whisky-frightened-rabbits-scott-hutchison?rq=Hutchison|date=October 2012|title=Guest column ‚Äì Whisky and me by Frightened Rabbit's Scott Hutchison|first=Scott|last=Hutchison|work=[[Q Magazine]]|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially considering himself solely a guitarist, Hutchison began singing at the age of nineteen, stating: "Up to that point I was just a guitar player. I didn't know I could sing, I had been told I couldn't."&lt;ref name=dirty/&gt; His early songwriting influences included such American artists as [[Ryan Adams]], [[Wilco]] and [[Laura Cantrell]], with Hutchison noting, "When I started writing songs, my references were [these] [[Americana (music)|Americana]] acts. [...] I could associate with those stories. And you can see American [[Folk music|folk]]'s deep connections with Scottish folk."&lt;ref name="Metro Lewis"/&gt;

===Formation of Frightened Rabbit, ''Sing the Greys'' and ''The Midnight Organ Fight'' (2003‚Äì2009)===
In 2003, Hutchison began performing under the name Frightened Rabbit, a name given to him by his mother to describe his once shy nature,&lt;ref name="Spin Marchese"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marchese|first1=David|date=25 January 2010|title=How They Became‚Ä¶ Frightened Rabbit|url=https://www.spin.com/2010/01/how-they-became-frightened-rabbit|website=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began recording and performing with his brother the following year. The duo recorded the band's debut album, ''[[Sing the Greys]]'', at The Diving Bell Lounge, with producer Marcus MacKay, and released it independently on local label, Hits the Fan, in 2006; the band signed soon after to [[Fat Cat Records]].&lt;ref name="GUAR"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Devlin|first1=Kieran|title=Frightened Rabbit's Scott Hutchison: a songwriter who found humanity in our flaws|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/11/frightened-rabbit-scott-hutchison-songwriter-humanity |date=11 May 2018 |accessdate=11 May 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joined by guitarist Billy Kennedy, the band reissued the album on their new label and began work on its follow-up, ''[[The Midnight Organ Fight]]'' (2008), with producer [[Peter Katis]], in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]. Influenced by the collapse of his relationship with his high school and college girlfriend [[Shell Jubin]],&lt;ref name="thepopcop.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thepopcop.co.uk/2013/01/frightened-rabbit-doomed-relationships-big-brother-and-the-missing-28000/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602141046/http://thepopcop.co.uk/2013/01/frightened-rabbit-doomed-relationships-big-brother-and-the-missing-28000/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-06-02 |title=Frightened Rabbit: Doomed relationships, Big Brother and the missing $28,000 |website=[[The Pop Cop]] |date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the deeply personal album was released to widespread critical acclaim and increased the band's exposure significantly.&lt;ref name="AVclub"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frightened Rabbit wraps up its session with the momentous 'Head Rolls Off'|url=https://music.avclub.com/frightened-rabbit-wraps-up-its-session-with-the-momento-1825757288|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=4 May 2018|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Owl John===
Owl John was a solo musical project by Hutchison, formed in 2014. Regarding Owl John and his decision to release a solo record, Hutchison noted, "It was approximately 10 years ago that I started a band called Frightened Rabbit. In that time I've dedicated so much of my life to that good wee band with a stupid name, I felt it was time to indulge Owl John."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/bands/Owl-John/59025/ |title=Owl John |work=Sputnik Music |accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/OWL-JOHN-Self-Titled-Debut-Album-Out-85-20140611-page2# |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094333/http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/OWL-JOHN-Self-Titled-Debut-Album-Out-85-20140611-page2 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 March 2016 |title=Owl John Self-Titled Debut Album Out 8/5 Page 2 |website=[[Broadway World]] |accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutchison recorded the project's sole album, ''Owl John'' (2014), alongside his Frightened Rabbit bandmate Andy Monaghan and the band's touring guitarist Simon Liddell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bermingham|first1=Finbarr|title=Saving Grace: Owl John on the record that rescued Frightened Rabbit|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/interviews/saving-grace-owl-john-on-the-record-that-rescued-frightened-rabbit|website=[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]]|date=1 August 2014|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, whilst touring in support of Frightened Rabbit's fourth studio album, ''[[Pedestrian Verse]]'' (2013), Hutchison expressed his desire to record solo material without the band, stating: "The process has to be different, otherwise I'm just going to make a Frightened Rabbit-sounding record, which I really don't want to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gavin |last=Butler |url=https://hhhhappy.com/owl-john-self-titled-album/ |title=Owl John ‚Äì Self Titled Album |work=Happy Media PTY. Limited |accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for a solo album stemmed from Frightened Rabbit's label, [[Atlantic Records]]: "It was actually the idea of the label to make it rather than me. I thought we were going to get off tour and go straight back into writing another album, and the guy at the label knew things weren't really quite right. He basically was like, 'We'll pay for this record. Go away, make a record and indulge yourself.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaplan|date=18 July 2014|first=Ilana|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/exclusive-video-premiere-and-interview-hate-music-owl-john#_ |title=Exclusive Video Premiere and Interview: 'Hate Music', Owl John |work=[[Interview Magazine]]|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, work began on the album, on the [[Isle of Mull]], with bandmate Andy Monaghan producing, alongside Simon Liddell. Released on 4 August 2014, the self-titled album debuted at number ninety-nine on the [[UK Albums Chart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-chart/20140810/7502|title=Official Albums Chart Top 100: 10‚Äì16 August 2014|website=[[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]]|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaborations==
===The Fruit Tree Foundation===
Hutchison wrote and recorded with [[The Fruit Tree Foundation]], a collaborative project featuring Scottish [[indie rock]] and [[Folk music|folk]] musicians. The resulting album, ''First Edition'', was released in 2011. Regarding the experience, Hutchison stated: "It was really beautifully done. I thought it was such a great thing, and also personally, for me, that was my first taste of proper collaboration and it really changed my outlook on songwriting. Before, I was kind of like, 'Yeah, I know how to write songs. I don't need anyone's help', and then, of course, you learn so much. So it changed my whole outlook, and I would love to get involved in that kind of thing again."&lt;ref name="list"&gt;{{cite web|date=7 October 2013|url=http://www.list.co.uk/article/55380-interview-scott-hutchison-from-frightened-rabbit|title=Interview: Scott Hutchison from Frightened Rabbit|first=Kelly|last=Smith|work=[[The List (magazine)|The List]]|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Birthday Suit===
Hutchison performed a guitar solo on the track, "A Bigger World", by the [[indie rock]] band [[The Birthday Suit]], and is featured in its accompanying music video. The song was the first single to be released from the band's third studio album, ''A Hollow Hole of Riches'' (2014).&lt;ref name="ABOF"&gt;{{cite web |date=5 March 2014 |title=The Birthday Suit announce single 'All Of This Everything' |url=http://www.abadgeoffriendship.com/news/entry/the-birthday-suit-announce-single-all-of-this-everything|website=A Badge of Friendship|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mastersystem===
{{main|Mastersystem}}
Hutchison formed the "indie supergroup" in 2017 with his brother Grant, and the brothers, Justin and James Lockey from [[Editors]] and [[Minor Victories]] respectively. The band released one album, ''Dance Music'', in 2018.&lt;ref name="NME"&gt;{{cite web|last=Trendell|first=Andrew|date=5 April 2018|title=Mastersystem 'Dance Music' review|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/album/mastersystem-dance-music-review|website=NME |accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oyster ===
Hutchison is credited for all of the artwork in ''Oyster'', a book of poetry written by Edinburgh poet Michael Pedersen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://store.warnermusic.com/oyster-poetry-illustrated-by-scott-hutchison.html|title=Oyster: Poetry Illustrated By Scott Hutchison|website=store.warnermusic.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stem cells'''     are [[cell (biology)|biological cells]] that can [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into other types of cells and can [[cell division|divide]] to produce more of the same type of stem cells. They are found in [[multicellular organisms]].

In [[mammal]]s, there are two broad types of stem cells: [[embryonic stem cell]]s, which are isolated from the [[inner cell mass]] of [[blastocyst]]s, and [[adult stem cell]]s, which are found in various [[tissue (biology)|tissues]]. In [[adult]] organisms, stem cells and [[progenitor cell]]s act as a repair system for the body, replenishing adult tissues. In a developing [[embryo]], stem cells can differentiate into all the specialized cells‚Äîectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm (see [[induced pluripotent stem cells]])‚Äîbut also maintain the normal turnover of regenerative organs, such as blood, skin, or intestinal tissues.

There are three known accessible sources of [[autologous]] adult stem cells in humans:
# [[Bone marrow]], which requires extraction by ''harvesting'', that is, drilling into bone (typically the [[femur]] or [[iliac crest]]).
# Adipose tissue (fat cells), which requires extraction by liposuction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coughlin RP, Oldweiler A, Mickelson DT, Moorman CT | title = Adipose-Derived Stem Cell Transplant Technique for Degenerative Joint Disease | journal = Arthroscopy Techniques | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = e1761-e1766 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29399463 | pmc = 5795060 | doi = 10.1016/j.eats.2017.06.048 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Blood, which requires extraction through [[apheresis]], wherein blood is drawn from the donor (similar to a blood donation), and passed through a machine that extracts the stem cells and returns other portions of the blood to the donor.
Stem cells can also be taken from [[umbilical cord blood]] just after birth. Of all stem cell types, autologous harvesting involves the least risk. By definition, autologous cells are obtained from one's own body, just as one may bank his or her own blood for elective surgical procedures.

Adult stem cells are frequently used in various medical therapies (e.g., [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone marrow transplantation]]). Stem cells can now be [[Cell culture|artificially grown]] and transformed (differentiated) into specialized cell types with characteristics consistent with cells of various tissues such as muscles or nerves. Embryonic [[cell line]]s and [[autologous]] embryonic stem cells generated through [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] or [[Cellular differentiation#Dedifferentiation|dedifferentiation]] have also been proposed as promising candidates for future therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuch BE | title = Stem cells--a clinical update | journal = Australian Family Physician | volume = 35 | issue = 9 | pages = 719‚Äì21 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16969445 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into stem cells grew out of findings by [[Ernest McCulloch|Ernest A. McCulloch]] and [[James Till|James E. Till]] at the [[University of Toronto]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Becker AJ, McCULLOCH EA, Till JE | title = Cytological demonstration of the clonal nature of spleen colonies derived from transplanted mouse marrow cells | journal = Nature | volume = 197 | issue = 4866 | pages = 452‚Äì4 | date = February 1963 | pmid = 13970094 | doi = 10.1038/197452a0 | bibcode = 1963Natur.197..452B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Siminovitch L, Mcculloch EA, Till JE | title = THE DISTRIBUTION OF COLONY-FORMING CELLS AMONG SPLEEN COLONIES | journal = Journal of Cellular and Comparative Physiology | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = 327‚Äì36 | date = December 1963 | pmid = 14086156 | doi = 10.1002/jcp.1030620313 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
The classical definition of a stem cell requires that it possesses two properties:
* ''Self-renewal'': the ability to go through numerous [[cell cycle|cycles]] of [[cell division]] while maintaining the undifferentiated state.
* ''Potency'': the capacity to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into specialized cell types. In the strictest sense, this requires stem cells to be either [[totipotency|totipotent]] or [[pluripotency|pluripotent]]‚Äîto be able to give rise to any mature cell type, although [[multipotent]] or [[unipotent cell|unipotent]] [[progenitor cell]]s are sometimes referred to as stem cells. Apart from this it is said that stem cell function is regulated in a feed back mechanism.

===Self-renewal===
Two mechanisms exist to ensure that a stem cell population is maintained:

1. [[Asymmetric cell division|Obligatory asymmetric replication]]: a stem cell divides into one mother cell that is identical to the original stem cell, and another daughter cell that is differentiated.

When a stem cell self-renews it divides and does not disrupt the undifferentiated state. This self-renewal demands control of cell cycle as well as upkeep of multipotency or pluripotency, which all depends on the stem cell.&lt;ref&gt;Shenghui, H. E., Nakada, D., &amp; Morrison, S. J. (2009). Mechanisms of stem cell self-renewal. Annual Review of Cell and Developmental, 25, 377‚Äì406.&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Stochastic differentiation: when one stem cell develops into two differentiated daughter cells, another stem cell undergoes [[mitosis]] and produces two stem cells identical to the original.

===Potency meaning===
{{Main|Cell potency}}
[[Image:Stem cells diagram.png|upright=1.5|thumb|right|Pluripotent, embryonic stem cells originate as inner cell mass (ICM) cells within a blastocyst. These stem cells can become any tissue in the body, excluding a placenta. Only cells from an earlier stage of the embryo, known as the [[morula]], are totipotent, able to become all tissues in the body and the extraembryonic placenta.]]
[[Image:Human embryonic stem cells.png|thumb|Human [[embryo]]nic stem cells &lt;br /&gt; A: Stem cell colonies that are not yet differentiated. &lt;br /&gt; B: [[Nerve]] cells, an example of a [[cell type]] after differentiation.]]

''Potency'' specifies the differentiation potential (the potential to differentiate into different cell types) of the stem cell.&lt;ref name=Schoeler&gt;{{cite book |title=Humanbiotechnology as Social Challenge |editor1=Nikolaus Knoepffler |editor2=Dagmar Schipanski |editor3=Stefan Lorenz Sorgner |page=28 |chapter=The Potential of Stem Cells: An Inventory |author=Sch√∂ler, Hans R. |publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7546-5755-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Totipotency|Totipotent]] (a.k.a. omnipotent) stem cells can differentiate into embryonic and extraembryonic cell types. Such cells can construct a complete, viable organism.&lt;ref name=Schoeler/&gt; These cells are produced from the [[Cell fusion|fusion]] of an egg and sperm cell. Cells produced by the first few divisions of the fertilized egg are also totipotent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mitalipov S, Wolf D | title = Totipotency, pluripotency and nuclear reprogramming | journal = Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology | volume = 114 | pages = 185‚Äì99 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19343304 | pmc = 2752493 | doi = 10.1007/10_2008_45 | isbn = 978-3-540-88805-5 | series = Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology | bibcode = 2009esc..book..185M }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pluripotency|Pluripotent]] stem cells are the descendants of totipotent cells and can differentiate into nearly all cells,&lt;ref name=Schoeler/&gt; i.e. cells derived from any of the three [[germ layer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ulloa-Montoya F, Verfaillie CM, Hu WS | title = Culture systems for pluripotent stem cells | journal = Journal of Bioscience and Bioengineering | volume = 100 | issue = 1 | pages = 12‚Äì27 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 16233846 | doi = 10.1263/jbb.100.12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Multipotency|Multipotent]] stem cells can differentiate into a number of cell types, but only those of a closely related family of cells.&lt;ref name=Schoeler/&gt;
* [[Oligopotency|Oligopotent]] stem cells can differentiate into only a few cell types, such as lymphoid or myeloid stem cells.&lt;ref name=Schoeler/&gt;
* [[Unipotency|Unipotent]] cells can produce only one cell type, their own,&lt;ref name=Schoeler/&gt; but have the property of self-renewal, which distinguishes them from non-stem cells (e.g. [[progenitor cell]]s, which cannot self-renew).

===Identification===
In practice, stem cells are identified by whether they can regenerate tissue. For example, the defining test for bone marrow or [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s (HSCs) is the ability to transplant the cells and save an individual without HSCs. This demonstrates that the cells can produce new blood cells over a long term. It should also be possible to isolate stem cells from the transplanted individual, which can themselves be transplanted into another individual without HSCs, demonstrating that the stem cell was able to self-renew.

Properties of stem cells can be illustrated ''[[in vitro]]'', using methods such as [[clonogenic assay]]s, in which single cells are assessed for their ability to differentiate and self-renew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Friedenstein AJ, Deriglasova UF, Kulagina NN, Panasuk AF, Rudakowa SF, Luri√° EA, Ruadkow IA | title = Precursors for fibroblasts in different populations of hematopoietic cells as detected by the in vitro colony assay method | journal = Experimental Hematology | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 83‚Äì92 | year = 1974 | pmid = 4455512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

However, ''in vitro'' culture conditions can alter the behavior of cells, making it unclear whether the cells shall behave in a similar manner ''[[in vivo]]''. There is considerable debate as to whether some proposed adult cell populations are truly stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-09-01|title=Stem Cell Therapy|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0976001611602093|journal=Apollo Medicine|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=271‚Äì276|doi=10.1016/S0976-0016(11)60209-3|issn=0976-0016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embryonic==
{{Main|Embryonic stem cell}}

[[Embryonic stem cell]]s (ESCs) are the cells of the [[inner cell mass]] of a [[blastocyst]], an early-stage [[embryo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomson JA, Itskovitz-Eldor J, Shapiro SS, Waknitz MA, Swiergiel JJ, Marshall VS, Jones JM | title = Embryonic stem cell lines derived from human blastocysts | journal = Science | volume = 282 | issue = 5391 | pages = 1145‚Äì7 | date = November 1998 | pmid = 9804556 | doi = 10.1126/science.282.5391.1145 | bibcode = 1998Sci...282.1145T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human [[embryo]]s reach the [[blastocyst]] stage 4‚Äì5 days post [[Human fertilization|fertilization]], at which time they consist of 50‚Äì150 cells. ESCs are [[pluripotent]] and give rise during development to all derivatives of the three primary [[germ layer]]s: ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. In other words, they can develop into each of the more than 200 cell types of the adult [[human body|body]] when given sufficient and necessary stimulation for a specific cell type. They do not contribute to the extra-embryonic membranes or the [[placenta]].

During embryonic development these inner cell mass cells continuously divide and become more specialized.  For example, a portion of the ectoderm in the dorsal part of the embryo specializes as '[[neurectoderm]]', which will become the future [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref name="Developmental biology"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Scott F.|last2=College|first2=Swarthmore| name-list-format = vanc  |title=Developmental biology|date=2014|publisher=Sinauer|location=Sunderland, Mass.|isbn=978-0878939787|edition=Tenth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in development, [[neurulation]] causes the neurectoderm to form the [[neural tube]].  At the neural tube stage, the anterior portion undergoes [[encephalization]] to generate or 'pattern' the basic form of the brain.  At this stage of development, the principal cell type of the CNS is considered a [[neural stem cell]].  These neural stem cells are pluripotent, as they can generate a large diversity of many different neuron types, each with unique gene expression, morphological, and functional characteristics.  The process of generating neurons from stem cells is called [[neurogenesis]].  One prominent example of a neural stem cell is the [[radial glial cell]], so named because it has a distinctive bipolar morphology with highly elongated processes spanning the thickness of the neural tube wall, and because historically it shared some [[glial]] characteristics, most notably the expression of [[glial fibrillary acidic protein]] (GFAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rakic P | title = Evolution of the neocortex: a perspective from developmental biology | journal = Nature Reviews. Neuroscience | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = 724‚Äì35 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19763105 | pmc = 2913577 | doi = 10.1038/nrn2719 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Noctor SC, Flint AC, Weissman TA, Dammerman RS, Kriegstein AR | title = Neurons derived from radial glial cells establish radial units in neocortex | journal = Nature | volume = 409 | issue = 6821 | pages = 714‚Äì20 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11217860 | doi = 10.1038/35055553 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The radial glial cell is the primary neural stem cell of the developing [[vertebrate]] CNS, and its cell body resides in the [[ventricular zone]], adjacent to the developing [[ventricular system]].  Neural stem cells are committed to the neuronal lineages ([[neuron]]s, [[astrocyte]]s, and [[oligodendrocyte]]s), and thus their potency is restricted.&lt;ref name="Developmental biology"/&gt;

Nearly all research to date has made use of mouse embryonic stem cells (mES) or human embryonic stem cells (hES) derived from the early inner cell mass.  Both have the essential stem cell characteristics, yet they require very different environments in order to maintain an undifferentiated state. Mouse ES cells are grown on a layer of [[gelatin]] as an [[extracellular matrix]] (for support) and require the presence of [[leukemia inhibitory factor]] (LIF) in serum media. A drug cocktail containing inhibitors to [[GSK3B]] and the [[MAPK/ERK pathway]], called 2i, has also been shown to maintain pluripotency in stem cell culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ying QL, Wray J, Nichols J, Batlle-Morera L, Doble B, Woodgett J, Cohen P, Smith A | title = The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal | journal = Nature | volume = 453 | issue = 7194 | pages = 519‚Äì23 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18497825 | pmc = 5328678 | doi = 10.1038/nature06968 | bibcode = 2008Natur.453..519Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human ESCs are grown on a feeder layer of mouse embryonic [[fibroblasts]] and require the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF-2).&lt;ref&gt;

A human embryonic stem cell is also defined by the expression of several transcription factors and cell surface proteins. The transcription factors [[Oct-4]], [[Homeobox protein NANOG|Nanog]], and [[Sox2]] form the core regulatory network that ensures the suppression of genes that lead to differentiation and the maintenance of pluripotency.&lt;ref&gt;

By using human embryonic stem cells to produce specialized cells like nerve cells or heart cells in the lab, scientists can gain access to adult human cells without taking tissue from patients. They can then study these specialized adult cells in detail to try and catch complications of diseases, or to study cells reactions to potentially new drugs.  The molecular definition of a stem cell includes many more proteins and continues to be a topic of research.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ES cells, being pluripotent cells, require specific signals for correct differentiation‚Äîif injected directly into another body, ES cells will differentiate into many different types of cells, causing a [[teratoma]].

The use of adult stem cells in research and therapy is not as [[Stem cell controversy|controversial]] as the use of [[embryonic stem cell]]s, because the production of adult stem cells does not require the destruction of an [[embryo]]. Additionally, in instances where adult stem cells are obtained from the intended recipient (an [[autograft]]), the risk of rejection is essentially non-existent. Consequently, more US government funding is being provided for adult stem cell research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2004pres/20040714b.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109104735/http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2004pres/20040714b.html |archive-date=2009-01-09 |publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services |title=Stem Cell FAQ |date=2004-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amniotic==
Multipotent stem cells are also found in [[amniotic fluid]]. These stem cells are very active, expand extensively without feeders and are not tumorigenic. [[Amniotic stem cells]] are multipotent and can differentiate in cells of adipogenic, osteogenic, myogenic, endothelial, hepatic and also neuronal lines.&lt;ref&gt;

Amniotic stem cells are a topic of active research.

Use of stem cells from [[amniotic fluid]] overcomes the ethical objections to using human embryos as a source of cells.  [[Roman Catholic]] teaching forbids the use of embryonic stem cells in experimentation; accordingly, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] newspaper "[[Osservatore Romano]]" called amniotic stem cells "the future of medicine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/vatican_newspaper_calls_new_stem_cell_source_future_of_medicine/ |title=Vatican newspaper calls new stem cell source 'future of medicine' :: Catholic News Agency (CNA) |publisher=Catholic News Agency |date=2010-02-03 |access-date=2010-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Induced pluripotent==
{{Main|Induced pluripotent stem cell}}

Adult stem cells have limitations with their potency; unlike [[embryonic stem cell]]s (ESCs), they are not able to differentiate into cells from all three [[germ layers]]. As such, they are deemed [[cell potency|multipotent]].

However, [[reprogramming]] allows for the creation of pluripotent cells, [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s (iPSCs), from adult cells. These are not adult stem cells, but adult cells (e.g. epithelial cells) reprogrammed to give rise to cells with pluripotent capabilities. Using genetic reprogramming with protein [[transcription factors]], pluripotent stem cells with ESC-like capabilities have been derived.&lt;ref name="Economist2007_11_22"&gt;{{cite news|title=Making human embryonic stem cells|publisher=The Economist|url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10170972|date=2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16466265|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|title=Skin Cells Can Become Embryonic Stem Cells|author1=Brand, Madeleine |author2=Palca, Joe |author3=Cohen, Alex |date=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/science/july-dec07/stemcells_11-20.html|title=Breakthrough Set to Radically Change Stem Cell Debate|publisher=[[News Hour with Jim Lehrer]]|date=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first demonstration of induced pluripotent stem cells was conducted by [[Shinya Yamanaka]] and his colleagues at [[Kyoto University]].&lt;ref name = "overview"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimbrel EA, Lanza R | title = Pluripotent stem cells: the last 10 years | journal = Regenerative Medicine | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 831‚Äì847 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27908220 | doi = 10.2217/rme-2016-0117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They used the transcription factors [[Oct-4|Oct3/4]], [[Sox2]], [[c-Myc]], and [[Klf4]] to reprogram mouse fibroblast cells into pluripotent cells.&lt;ref name="Economist2007_11_22"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "og Yak"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi K, Yamanaka S | title = Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors | journal = Cell | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 663‚Äì76 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16904174 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent work used these factors to induce pluripotency in human fibroblast cells.&lt;ref name= "2007 Yak"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi K, Tanabe K, Ohnuki M, Narita M, Ichisaka T, Tomoda K, Yamanaka S | title = Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors | journal = Cell | volume = 131 | issue = 5 | pages = 861‚Äì72 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18035408 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Junying Yu]], [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|James Thomson]], and their colleagues at the [[University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison]] used a different set of factors, Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Lin28, and carried out their experiments using cells from human [[foreskin]].&lt;ref name="Economist2007_11_22"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "wisconsin"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu J, Vodyanik MA, Smuga-Otto K, Antosiewicz-Bourget J, Frane JL, Tian S, Nie J, Jonsdottir GA, Ruotti V, Stewart R, Slukvin II, Thomson JA | title = Induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from human somatic cells | journal = Science | volume = 318 | issue = 5858 | pages = 1917‚Äì20 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18029452 | doi = 10.1126/science.1151526 | bibcode = 2007Sci...318.1917Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were able to replicate [[Yamanaka]]'s finding that inducing pluripotency in human cells was possible.

Induced pluripotent stem cells differ from embryonic stem cells. They share many similar properties, such as [[pluripotency]] and differentiation potential, the expression of [[pluripotency]] genes, [[epigenetic]] patterns, [[embryoid body]] and [[teratoma]] formation, and viable [[chimera (genetics)|chimera]] formation,&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "og Yak" /&gt; but there are many differences within these properties. The chromatin of iPSCs appears to be more "closed" or methylated than that of ESCs.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "og Yak" /&gt; Similarly, the gene expression pattern between ESCs and iPSCs, or even iPSCs sourced from different origins.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt; There are thus questions about the "completeness" of [[reprogramming]] and the somatic memory of induced pluripotent stem cells. Despite this, inducing [[adult cell]]s to be pluripotent appears to be viable.

As a result of the success of these experiments, [[Ian Wilmut]], who helped create the first cloned animal [[Dolly the Sheep]], has announced that he will abandon [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] as an avenue of research.&lt;ref&gt;"His inspiration comes from the research by Prof [[Shinya Yamanaka]] at [[Kyoto University]], which suggests a way to create human embryo stem cells without the need for human eggs, which are in extremely short supply, and without the need to create and destroy human cloned embryos, which is bitterly opposed by the pro life movement."{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3314696/Dolly-creator-Prof-Ian-Wilmut-shuns-cloning.html|title=Dolly creator Prof Ian Wilmut shuns cloning|author=Highfield, Roger |date=2007-11-16|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, induced pluripotent stem cells provide several therapeutic advantages. Like ESCs, they are [[pluripotent]]. They thus have great differentiation potential; theoretically, they could produce any cell within the human body (if [[reprogramming]] to pluripotency was "complete").&lt;ref name = "overview" /&gt; Moreover, unlike ESCs, they potentially could allow doctors to create a pluripotent stem cell line for each individual patient.&lt;ref name="R&amp;D"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robinton DA, Daley GQ | title = The promise of induced pluripotent stem cells in research and therapy | journal = Nature | volume = 481 | issue = 7381 | pages = 295‚Äì305 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22258608 | pmc = 3652331 | doi = 10.1038/nature10761 | bibcode = 2012Natur.481..295R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frozen blood samples can be used as a valuable source of induced pluripotent stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100703175036/http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/tre6604si-us-stemcells-frozen/ Frozen blood a source of stem cells, study finds]. newsdaily.com (2010-07-01)&lt;/ref&gt; Patient specific stem cells allow for the screening for side effects before drug treatment, as well as the reduced risk of transplantation rejection.&lt;ref name= "R&amp;D" /&gt; Despite their current limited use therapeutically, iPSCs hold create potential for future use in medical treatment and research.

==Lineage==
{{Main|Stem cell line}}
To ensure self-renewal, stem cells undergo two types of cell division (see ''Stem cell division and differentiation'' diagram). Symmetric division gives rise to two identical daughter cells both endowed with stem cell properties. Asymmetric division, on the other hand, produces only one stem cell and a [[progenitor cell]] with limited self-renewal potential. Progenitors can go through several rounds of cell division before terminally [[cell differentiation|differentiating]] into a mature cell. It is possible that the molecular distinction between symmetric and asymmetric divisions lies in differential segregation of cell membrane proteins (such as [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]]) between the daughter cells.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Beckmann J, Scheitza S, Wernet P, Fischer JC, Giebel B | title = Asymmetric cell division within the human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartment: identification of asymmetrically segregating proteins | journal = Blood | volume = 109 | issue = 12 | pages = 5494‚Äì501 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17332245 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2006-11-055921 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative theory is that stem cells remain undifferentiated due to environmental cues in their particular niche. Stem cells differentiate when they leave that niche or no longer receive those signals. Studies in ''Drosophila'' germarium have identified the signals [[decapentaplegic]] and adherens junctions that prevent germarium stem cells from differentiating.&lt;ref&gt;

==Treatments==
{{Main|Stem cell therapy}}

Stem cell therapy is the use of stem cells to treat or prevent a disease or condition.  [[Bone marrow transplant]] is a form of stem cell therapy that has been used for many years without controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Murnaghan for Explore Stem Cells. Updated: 16 December 2013  [http://www.explorestemcells.co.uk/WhyPerformStemCellTransplant.html Why Perform a Stem Cell Transplant?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCI&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Therapy/bone-marrow-transplant Bone Marrow Transplantation and Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation] In National Cancer Institute Fact Sheet web site. Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010.  Cited August 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advantages ===
Stem cell treatments may lower symptoms of the disease or condition that is being treated. The lowering of symptoms may allow patients to reduce the drug intake of the disease or condition. Stem cell treatment may also provide knowledge for society to further stem cell understanding and future treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Master |first=Zubin |last2=McLeod |first2=Marcus |last3=Mendez |first3=Ivar | name-list-format = vanc |date=2007 |title=Benefits, Risks and Ethical Considerations in Translation of Stem Cell Research to Clinical Applications in Parkinson's Disease |jstor=27719821 |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=169‚Äì73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
Stem cell treatments may require [[immunosuppression]] because of a requirement for radiation before the transplant to remove the person's previous cells, or because the patient's immune system may target the stem cells. One approach to avoid the second possibility is to use stem cells from the same patient who is being treated.

Pluripotency in certain stem cells could also make it difficult to obtain a specific cell type. It is also difficult to obtain the exact cell type needed, because not all cells in a population differentiate uniformly. Undifferentiated cells can create tissues other than desired types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Moore KL, Persaud TV, Torchia MG | title = Before We Are Born: Essentials of Embryology and Birth Defects. | location = Philadelphia, PA | publisher = Saunders, Elsevier | date = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved on July 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a request for the [[US Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) to re-examine the three patents was filed by the [[Public Patent Foundation]] on behalf of its client, the non-profit patent-watchdog group [[Consumer Watchdog]] (formerly the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights).&lt;ref name = "stemcellPatent"/&gt;   In the re-examination process, which involves several rounds of discussion between the USPTO and the parties, the USPTO initially agreed with Consumer Watchdog and rejected all the claims in all three patents,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Jenei for Patent Baristas, April 3, 2007 [http://www.patentbaristas.com/archives/2007/04/03/warf-stem-cell-patents-knocked-down-in-round-one/ WARF Stem Cell Patents Knocked Down in Round One]&lt;/ref&gt; however in response, WARF amended the claims of all three patents to make them more narrow, and in 2008 the USPTO found the amended claims in all three patents to be patentable. The decision on one of the patents (7,029,913) was appealable, while the decisions on the other two were not.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Jenei for Patent Baristas, March 3, 2008 [http://www.patentbaristas.com/archives/2008/03/03/ding-warf-wins-round-2-as-stem-cell-patent-upheld/ Ding!

March 12, 2008 [http://news.sciencemag.org/2008/03/warf-goes-3-3-patents WARF Goes 3 for 3 on Patents]&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer Watchdog appealed the granting of the '913 patent to the USPTO's Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (BPAI) which granted the appeal, and in 2010 the BPAI decided that the amended claims of the '913 patent were not patentable.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen G.

In July 2013, Consumer Watchdog announced that it would appeal the decision to allow the claims of the '913 patent to the US [[Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] (CAFC), the federal appeals court that hears patent cases.&lt;ref&gt;GenomeWeb staff, July 03, 2013 [http://www.genomeweb.com/consumer-watchdog-ppf-seek-invalidation-warfs-stem-cell-patent Consumer Watchdog, PPF Seek Invalidation of WARF's Stem Cell Patent]&lt;/ref&gt;  At a hearing in December 2013, the CAFC raised the question of whether Consumer Watchdog had [[legal standing]] to appeal; the case could not proceed until that issue was resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Antoinette Konski for Personalized Medicine Bulletin.

In more recent years, with the ability of scientists to isolate and culture [[embryonic stem cells]], and with scientists' growing ability to create stem cells using [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] and techniques to create [[induced pluripotent stem cells]], controversy has crept in, both related to [[abortion debate|abortion politics]] and to [[human cloning]].

[[Hepatotoxicity]] and drug-induced liver injury account for a substantial number of failures of new drugs in development and market withdrawal, highlighting the need for screening assays such as stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells, that are capable of detecting toxicity early in the [[drug development]] process.&lt;ref name="stem2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenhough S, Hay DC |title=Stem Cell-Based Toxicity Screening: Recent Advances in Hepatocyte Generation |url=http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Abstract/2012/26020/Stem_Cell_Based_Toxicity_Screening__Recent.2.aspx |journal=Pharm Med |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=85‚Äì89 |year=2012 |doi=10.1007/BF03256896 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616075657/http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Abstract/2012/26020/Stem_Cell_Based_Toxicity_Screening__Recent.2.aspx |archive-date=2012-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Sparkman was raised in [[Mulberry, Florida]], the oldest of three sons of a [[High school (United States)|high school]] [[Principal (education)|principal]] and a furniture company executive.&lt;ref name=native&gt;{{cite news | author=Chambliss, John | title=Census Worker Who Died Was a Mulberry Native | work=The Ledger | location=Lakeland, Florida | date=September 26, 2009 | url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20090925/NEWS/909265031 | accessdate=September 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sparkman was an [[altar boy]] as a child.  In high school, he wrote for the local weekly newspaper, ''The Mulberry Press'', and was the football team manager.&lt;ref name=friends&gt;{{cite news | author=Alford, Roger | title=Friends: Hanging victim devoted his life to kids | date=September 26, 2009 | work=[[The Associated Press]] | url=http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/friends-hanging-victim-devoted-his-life-to-kids-1.1478406 | accessdate=September 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], he worked for the [[Boy Scouts of America]] as an adult, overseeing the programs in [[Polk County, Florida|Polk]] and [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough]] counties.&lt;ref name=native/&gt; This work later took him to [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]],&lt;ref name=native/&gt; then [[London, Kentucky]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=survivor&gt;{{cite news | author=Kaprowy, Tara | title=Cancer survivor earns degree | date=April 3, 2008 | work=The Sentinel Echo | location=London, KY | url=http://sentinel-echo.com/local/local_story_094220413.html | accessdate=September 29, 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130202101259/http://sentinel-echo.com/local/local_story_094220413.html | archivedate=February 2, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once in Kentucky he raised his adopted son alone, joined a local [[Methodist Church]], and for nine years worked at an [[elementary school]] as a volunteer and [[instructional assistant]].  In 2005 Sparkman began part-time work with the [[United States Census Bureau]] and studied education with [[Western Governors University]], an [[online college]]. In 2007, after medical treatment of an ingrown toe nail, Sparkman's doctor identified a cyst which led to his diagnosis of [[Cancer staging#Overall stage grouping|Stage-3]] [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] cancer.  He continued teaching while receiving [[chemotherapy]] treatments from November 2007 to March 2008, during which time he completed his academic coursework and was invited to [[Commencement speech|speak at the commencement ceremony]] at Western Governors University in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]].&lt;ref name=survivor/&gt;  After graduation he pursued a position as a [[middle school]] math teacher.&lt;ref name=friends/&gt;&lt;ref name=survivor/&gt;

Authorities eventually determined that Sparkman's death was a suicide, staged to look like a homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/11/24/kentucky.census.worker.death/ | work=CNN | title=Police: Kentucky census worker committed suicide, staged scene - CNN.com | accessdate=May 1, 2010 | date=November 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, police said that Sparkman's death was not natural, but hadn't ruled whether it was a homicide, a suicide, or an accident.&lt;ref name=family&gt;{{cite news | author=Alford, Roger |author2=Jeffrey McMurray | title=Family cemetery visit led to hanged census worker | date=September 26, 2009 | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jbzG_BlkG2Hfc818EPRRn1bBlP6gD9AUTE6G0 | accessdate=September 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After an investigation lasting more than two weeks by the Kentucky State Police,&lt;ref name=speculation/&gt; Sparkman's 19-year-old son, Josh Sparkman, expressed frustration and called it "disrespectful" that suicide or accident were still being considered.&lt;ref name=son/&gt;  In the ensuing days, Sparkman's son further said he was certain the death was a homicide, noting his father's truck had been "ransacked" with items stolen, such as Sparkman's census laptop and a family wedding ring, items not discovered by investigators.&lt;ref name=releasebody&gt;{{cite news  | author=McMurray, Jeffrey | title=Officials release body of hanged Ky. census worker | date=October 7, 2009 | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jbzG_BlkG2Hfc818EPRRn1bBlP6gD9B5PF5G3 | accessdate=October 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preliminary findings of the local coroner indicated Sparkman died from [[asphyxiation]],&lt;ref name=censushalted/&gt; and the Census Bureau's regional office in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] said law enforcement called it "an apparent homicide".&lt;ref name=apsource&gt;{{cite news | author=Barrett, Devlin |author2=Jeffrey McMurray | title=AP Source: Census worker hanged with 'fed' on body | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | date=September 24, 2009 | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jbzG_BlkG2Hfc818EPRRn1bBlP6gD9ATASJ00 | accessdate=September 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 6, Sparkman's body was released to his family, but the State Medical Examiner's Office stated it was not resolving the case.  It had only established the cause of death, not the manner of death, and it was still learning "bits and pieces of information".&lt;ref name=releasebody/&gt;  The Kentucky State Police agreed the case was "perplexing".&lt;ref name=CSM&gt;{{cite news | author=Jonsson, Patrik | title=Why police are keeping quiet on Census worker Sparkman death | date=October 1, 2009 | work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/1001/p02s13-usju.html | accessdate=October 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that "the case so far is notable for the lack of details divulged by law enforcement officials".&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;  In late October, officials reported the case was close to resolution and they were careful in "not rushing a decision".&lt;ref name=WithinWeeks&gt;{{cite news | author=Riley, Jason | title=Death investigation of Census worker expected to be resolved within weeks | date=October 27, 2009 | work=[[The Courier-Journal]] | url=http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20091027/NEWS01/910270355/Death+investigation+of+Census+worker+expected+to+be+resolved+within+weeks | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119215528/http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20091027/NEWS01/910270355/Death+investigation+of+Census+worker+expected+to+be+resolved+within+weeks | dead-url=yes | archive-date=January 19, 2013 | accessdate=November 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Berry (administrator)|John Berry]], director of the [[Office of Personnel Management]], stated his resolve to "come down on these perpetrators as hell hath no fury."&lt;ref name=CSM/&gt;

On November 23, investigators declared the death a suicide.  According to reports, Sparkman, who had previously battled [[non-Hodgkins lymphoma]], was suspected to have believed his cancer had returned, and just prior to his death had taken out life insurance policies totalling $600,000&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jbzG_BlkG2Hfc818EPRRn1bBlP6gD9C694S00 Police: Ky. census worker staged death as homicide]&lt;/ref&gt; which would have been paid to his financially struggling son in the event of death and which would not pay out for suicide or death from cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Police: Ky. census worker staged death as homicide | author=Bruce Schreiner |author2=Roger Alford | date=November 25, 2009 | work=[[The Washington Post]] | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/24/AR2009112401632.html?hpid=moreheadlines | accessdate=November 25, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Census impact==
Regional Director Wayne Hatcher of the Census Bureau's [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte, N.C.]] regional office, which has jurisdiction over a five-state area that includes Kentucky,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=The Charlotte Region | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau | url=https://www.census.gov/rocha/www/ | accessdate=October 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; held a small memorial service at the cemetery in Clay County on October 11. He said other employees had reacted to the death by requesting to work in teams during census gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=McMurray, Jeffrey | title=Official: Census takers want teams after Ky. death | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | date=October 12, 2009 | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jbzG_BlkG2Hfc818EPRRn1bBlP6gD9B97PD80 | accessdate=October 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While law enforcement conducted its investigation of the death, the [[United States Census Bureau]] suspended its work in Clay County.&lt;ref name=censushalted/&gt;

==Media reaction==
Because of Sparkman's status as a Federal Census Bureau worker and the word "fed" written on his body, the incident drew national attention.  On [[MSNBC]]'s ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]'', [[Rachel Maddow|Maddow]] speculated that a dislike among area residents of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] may have contributed to Sparkman's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title='The Rachel Maddow Show' for Friday, September 25, 2009 | date=September 28, 2008 | work=[[MSNBC.com]] | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33058032/ns/msnbc_tv-rachel_maddow_show/ | accessdate=September 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars disagreed, saying there isn't "an outpouring of anti-government sentiment in the region" and that "distrust of government" in the area is comparable to the rest of the country.&lt;ref name=apsource/&gt;  However, an [[Associated Press]] report stated the area "has a reputation for mistrusting government, dating back to the days of [[moonshine]]rs and '[[revenuers]]'",&lt;ref name=residents&gt;{{cite news | author=Biesk, Joe | title=Clay County residents worry about area's image | date=September 27, 2009 | work=[[The Courier-Journal]] | url=http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20090927/NEWS01/909270357/-1/rss | accessdate=September 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is a top [[marijuana]] producer&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; where federal agents have held drug and corruption raids numerous times.  Among those convicted for drug and corruption charges locally were a former [[Mayor#United States|mayor]], former [[city council]]men, an assistant [[police chief]], a [[county clerk]], a [[Magistrate#County Magistrates in Kentucky|magistrate]], an [[election commissioner]], the county's school [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]], and [[Kentucky Circuit Courts|circuit court]] [[Judge#United States|judge]] were indicted for voter fraud in March 2009.&lt;ref name=censushalted/&gt;  ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' also reported on possible connections to nearby drug activities and anti-government motives.&lt;ref name=CSM/&gt;  Clay County is one of the poorest counties in the United States and residents feared the incident would add to its negative stereotype, despite progress in education and efforts against crime.&lt;ref name=residents/&gt;

Some suggested Sparkman's death may have been related to controversies over the [[2010 United States Census|upcoming 2010 federal census]].  Earlier in 2009 several leading conservatives and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political figures spoke out against [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now|ACORN]]'s involvement in census surveys&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt; and boycotted IT over concerns that the census could be used against citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Linkins, Jason | title=Bachmann Compares Census To WWII Internment Camps | date=June 25, 2009 | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/25/bachmann-compares-census_n_221081.html | accessdate=September 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] faulted the census for contributing to the expanding government and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] activists boycotted it to push for [[Immigration reform#Immigration reform in the United States|immigration reform]].&lt;ref name=benjamin&gt;{{Cite web| author=Benjamin, Richard M. | title=Sparkman: Casualty of Methland, USA? Or Victim of Anti-Government Bile? | date=September 25, 2009 | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-m-benjamin/sparkman-casualty-of-meth_b_300156.html | accessdate=September 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that in the absence of public findings by investigators, some writers in the liberal [[blogosphere]] concluded that the death was the result of anti-government rhetoric during the [[presidency of Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

The Kentucky State Police, which conducted the investigation, noted that there had been wide misinformation and speculation from the media coverage of the incident.&lt;ref name=speculation/&gt;  Robert Stivers, the Republican [[Kentucky Senate|state senator]] from Clay County, said Sparkman's death had been "sensationalized" because of his status as a federal census worker.&lt;ref name=residents/&gt;  In late October, the KSP commander in charge of the case said baseless media speculation "has been a detriment to the investigation" by requiring investigators to examine those claims.&lt;ref name=WithinWeeks/&gt;

On December 11, an episode of the TV show ''[[Law &amp; Order (season 20)#Episodes|Law &amp; Order]]'' entitled "FED" featured a murder victim based on Sparkman, found shirtless with the word "FED" written on his chest.  However, this victim was a conservative campaign employee who was plotting against an ACORN-like organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Law &amp; Order - "Fed" | work=TV Review | date=December 14, 2009 | url=http://blogcritics.org/video/article/tv-review-law-order-fed/ | accessdate=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family reaction==
Sparkman's son, Josh, was adamant that his father did not commit suicide.&lt;ref name=sullivan&gt;[[John Jeremiah Sullivan]]. [https://www.gq.com/news-politics/big-issues/201001/american-grotesque-john-jeremiah-sullivan-birthers?printable=true "American Grotesque"], ''GQ'', January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He said a man who fights cancer as long as Sparkman had does not commit suicide, after showing the fight to live every day.&lt;ref name=sullivan/&gt;

'''''The Choice''''' (2008) is a philosophy book, where the author [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] explains his way of thinking about reality and the consequences of thinking clearly.

The book is structured as a dialogue between the author and his daughter Efrat, where he attempts to explain clearly the way he thinks, and the obstacles that prevent people from thinking in the same fashion. Interspersed between the dialogues are short cases that demonstrate or further explore the points raised in the discussion.

The content of this book might be seen as explaining the basic principles upon which are based the [[Theory of Constraints|TOC]] [[Thinking Processes (Theory of Constraints)|Thinking Processes]].

In the Revised Edition (2010) Efrat's own notes are included as she made during the conversation with her father, helping the reader determine the true essence of the book.

'''''The Secret''''' is a best-selling 2006 [[self-help]] book by [[Rhonda Byrne]], based on the [[The Secret (2006 film)|earlier film]] of the same name. It is based on the belief of the [[Law of attraction (New Thought)|law of attraction]], which claims that thoughts can change a person's life directly.&lt;ref name="Scientific American"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Shermer | first = Michael | authorlink = Michael Shermer | title = The (Other) Secret | work = [[Scientific American]] | date = 1 June 2007 | url = https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-other-secret/ | accessdate = 2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Live Science"&gt;{{cite web | last = Radford | first = Benjamin | authorlink = Benjamin Radford | title = 'The Secret' | work = [[Live Science]] | date = 3 February 2009 | url = http://www.livescience.com/5303-pseudoscience-secret.html | accessdate = 2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book has sold 30 million copies worldwide and has been translated into 50 languages.

==Background==
''The Secret'' was released as a film in March 2006, and later the same year as a book.  The book is influenced by [[Wallace Wattles]]' 1910 book ''[[The Science of Getting Rich]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Synopsis ==
Byrne re-introduces a notion originally popularized by persons such as [[Madame Blavatsky]] and [[Norman Vincent Peale]], which suggests that thinking about certain things will make them appear in one's life.  Byrne provides examples of historical persons who have allegedly achieved this.  Byrne cites a three-step process: ask, believe, and receive.&lt;ref&gt;The Secret, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is based on a quotation from the [[Bible]]'s [[Matthew 21:22]]: "And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive."

Byrne highlights the importance of gratitude and visualization in achieving one's desires, along with alleged examples.  Later chapters describe how to improve one's prosperity, relationships, and health, with more general thoughts about the universe.

==Reception==

===Gross===
The book has been translated into 50 languages and has sold over 30 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesecret.tv/creative-biography.html |title=Creative Biography :: Official Web Site of The Secret and The Power |publisher=Thesecret.tv |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due partly to an appearance on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'', the book and film had grossed $300 million in sales by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/01/15/self-help-industry-ent-sales-cx_ml_0115selfhelp.html |title=What People Are Still Willing To Pay For |publisher=Forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Byrne has subsequently released ''Secret'' merchandise and several related books.

===Critical response===
US TV host [[Oprah Winfrey]] is a proponent of the book. On [[The Larry King Show]] she said that the message of ''The Secret'' is the message she's been trying to share with the world on her show for the past 21 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zm3-exDWIg|title=Oprah Winfrey speaks about The Secret - Law of Attraction and how to use it!|first=|last=LearningTheSecret|date=9 May 2013|accessdate=11 January 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Rhonda Byrne]] was later invited to her show along with people who vow by ''The Secret''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/spirit/_75|title=Discovering The Secret|website=Oprah.com|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth Scott states the pros and cons of the book in her [[Verywell]] review. The pros she points out are that it is empowering, that even if things seem bleak it reminds you that there is a lot that you can do to change your circumstances. It gives the reader research on optimism, visualization, and the power of perspective, while stating that ''The Secret'' encourages people to really visualize their goals clearly in order to attract what they want. The cons that Scott points out are that some people believe that it conflicts with their religious values, while others see it as a complementary approach. The book does spend considerable time on how to use the Law of Attraction to gain expensive material possessions, and without direct action; many people have asserted that having such a focus on external things and material wealth goes against the spiritual wisdom of the Law of Attraction. Other cons that Scott points out are the criticism of the idea that we create our own difficult circumstances in life, pointing out people born in extreme poverty, and that The Law of Attraction is not scientifically proven, but more of an anecdotally-observed phenomenon." Her final thoughts are: "Though there are some hiccups to it, I would say that this book can provide some excellent opportunities for stress relief, and a rough road map to a better life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.verywell.com/the-secret-by-rhondy-byrne-book-review-3144495|last=Scott|first=Elizabeth|title=Book Review: The Secret by Rhonda Byrne|website=Verywell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valerie Frankel of ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'' wrote an article where she tries the principles of ''The Secret'' for four weeks. While she reached some of her goals, others had improved. Frankel's final assessment is: "Counting my blessings has been uplifting, reminding me of what's already great about my life. Visualization has forced me to pay attention to what I really desire. And laughing is never a bad idea. If you ignore The Secret's far-too-simplistic maxims (no, you will not be doomed to a miserable life for thinking negative thoughts) and the hocus-pocus (the cosmos isn't going to deliver a new car; it's busy), there's actually some helpful advice in the book. But it's nothing you don't already know." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/inspirational-stories/a12415/the-secret-1007/|title=Do You Know The Secret?|author=|date=18 September 2007|website=goodhousekeeping.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] published ''Bright-Sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America'' as a reaction to self-help books such as ''The Secret'', claiming that they promote political complacency and a failure to engage with reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrenreich|first= Barbara|title=Bright-sided: how the relentless promotion of positive thinking has undermined America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wxJlvB7bCO4C|accessdate=4 April 2010|year=2009|publisher=[[Metropolitan Books]] |location= New York|isbn= 978-0-8050-8749-9 |page= 235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Author Barbara Ehrenreich on 'Bright-Sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America' | date=13 October 2009 |publisher=[[Democracy Now!]]|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/10/13/author_barbara_ehrenreich_on_bright_sided|accessdate=29 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[John G. Stackhouse, Jr.]] has provided historical context, locating Byrne's book in the tradition of [[New Thought]] and popular religion, and concluding that "it isn‚Äôt new, and it isn‚Äôt a secret".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John |url=http://www.johnstackhouse.com/2007/02/21/oprahs-secret-new-old-good-bad/ |title=Oprah‚Äôs Secret: New?

Byrne's scientific claims, in particular concerning [[quantum physics]], have been rejected by a range of authors including Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons at ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chabris|first1=Christopher|last2=Simons|first2=Daniel|title=Fight ‚ÄòThe Power‚Äô|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/books/review/Chabris-t.html?_r=0|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Harvard University|Harvard]] physicist [[Lisa Randall]].&lt;ref&gt;Randall, Lisa. 2011. ''[[Knocking on Heaven‚Äôs Door: How Physics and Scientific Thinking Illuminate the Universe and the Modern World]]''. (Page 10)&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Carmichael and Ben Radford, writing for the [[Center for Inquiry]], have also pointed out that ''The Secret'' has no scientific foundation, stating that Byrne's book represents: "a time-worn trick of mixing banal [[truism]]s with [[magical thinking]] and presenting it as some sort of hidden knowledge: basically, it‚Äôs the new [[New Thought]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/secrets_and_lies/|title=Secrets and Lies|publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|date=29 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Cochran''' (1777&lt;ref&gt;[[David Allison (college president)|Allison, D]] [http://www.ourroots.ca/e/toc.aspx?id=11954 ''History of Nova Scotia, Vol. 2''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615040245/http://www.ourroots.ca/e/toc.aspx?id=11954 |date=June 15, 2011 }} p. 823&lt;/ref&gt; ‚Äì October 8, 1804) was a [[Nova Scotia]] lawyer and judge in [[Prince Edward Island]] and [[Upper Canada]].

Cochran was born in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], the son of [[Thomas Cochran (Nova Scotia politician)|Thomas Cochran]], a merchant and member of the [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly]] for [[Liverpool, Nova Scotia]] and Jane Allen. Cochran was one of 8 children born to his father's second wife.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/cochraninglisfam00eato_0#page/9/mode/1up/search/halifax&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied at [[University of King's College|King's College]], spent time in [[Quebec]] before headed to [[England]] to further his studies at [[Lincoln's Inn]] and was called to the English bar in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/cochraninglisfam00eato_0#page/9/mode/1up/search/halifax&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, Cochran was appointed Chief Justice for Prince Edward Island.

In June 1802, he was named judge for the Court of King's Bench for [[Upper Canada]] and headed west from Prince Edward Island. Cochran was travelling aboard the schooner [[HMS Speedy (1798)|HMS Speedy]] to attend a trial in the province when the ship sunk in a winter storm on [[Lake Ontario]] in 1804. There were no survivors. He was replaced on the bench by [[Robert Thorpe (judge)|Robert Thorpe]].

Major-General '''Sir William Henry Birkbeck''',  {{post-nominals|country=GBR|sep=,|KCB|CMG}} (8 April 1863 ‚Äì 16 April 1929) was a British Army officer and administrator. He served in the [[Second Boer War]] and [[First World War]], and was the director of [[Army Remount Service|remounts]] at [[British Army Headquarters]] from 1912 to 1920.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news |title=Major-General Sir W. H. Birkbeck ‚Äì Organizer and Administrator |work=[[The Times]] |publisher=The Times Digital Archive |page=21 |date=18 April 1929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Birkbeek was born on 8 April 1863 in [[Settle, North Yorkshire]] in [[England]] to banker Joseph Birkbeck and Mary Elizabeth (''n√©e'' Mackesy). He was educated at  [[Summer Fields School]] and [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington College]], where he was on the cricket team. He then entered the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]].&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

==Career==

In 1883, Birkbeek was commissioned as a [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] in the [[1st King's Dragoon Guards]], then sent to India. He served in the [[Hazara Expedition of 1888]] and Chin Lushai Expedition of 1889-90 as a signalling officer. He was [[mentioned in despatches]] and received the campaign medal and two clasps,&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; and was promoted to [[Captain (BARM)|captain]] on 31 January 1890.

He became ''aide-de-camp'' to Major-General [[Henry Clement Wilkinson]], commanding the North-Eastern District at York, while he prepared for entrance to [[Staff College, Camberley]]. He was in the famous 1896-97 class at Staff College that included [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig]] and [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby]], and many other officers who distinguished themselves in the Second Boer War and First World War, and was promoted to [[Major (British Army)|major]] on 3 April 1897.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

Birkbeck served throughout the Second Boer War in South Africa as assistant Inspector of Remounts and received the [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion to [[Lieutenant-colonel (British Army)|lieutenant-colonel]] on 29 November 1900. He impressed his superiors, the Commander-in-Chief in South Africa, [[Herbert Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], referred to him in a despatch as ''"perturbed by nothing"'' and with ''"considerable ability".''&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27459 |date=29 July 1902 |pages=4835‚Äì4836  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the war, he served with the War Office for two year as a Staff officer with military education and training under Field-Marshal Sir [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet|Henry Wilson]], who became  one of his closest friends. In 1905, he was posted for a year with the Japanese Army in Manchuria, "where his immense size and genial nature made an excellent impression on our Allies, and led them to help him with much valuable information for his reports."&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

After returning home, he spent several years as commander of the Cavalry School, on [[Netheravon]]. In 1912, he returned to the remount service, and served as its director with the War Office from 1912 to 1920.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

==Personal life==

In 1905, he married American Mabel (''n√©e'' Shaw), of New Brighton, Staten Island. They had three sons.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

In 1915, he suffered a fall from his horse and was injured, and never fully recovered. He died after a fall while hiking at [[Saint-Briac-sur-Mer|St. Briac]], near [[Dinard]] in France in 1929.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=General Sir W.

== Gene location and protein structure ==

Human ''YPEL3'' is located on the short arm of chromosome 16 (p1611.2) and covers 4.62kb from 30015754 to 30011130 on the reverse strand.&lt;ref name="Source1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/av.cgi?db=human&amp;l=YPEL3&lt;/ref&gt; The drosophilia Yippee protein was identified as a putative [[zinc finger]] motif containing protein exhibiting a high degree of conservation among the [[cysteine]]s and [[histidines]].&lt;ref name="Source5"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roxstr√∂m-Lindquist K, Faye I | title = The Drosophila gene Yippee reveals a novel family of putative zinc binding proteins highly conserved among eukaryotes | journal = Insect Molecular Biology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 77‚Äì86 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11240639 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2583.2001.00239.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinc fingers function as structural platforms for DNA binding.

== Nomenclature ==

YPEL3 was first identified as murine SUAP, named for small unstable apoptotic protein because of its apparent role in cellular growth inhibition via [[apoptosis]] when studied in myeloid precursor cell lines .&lt;ref name="Source4"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Baker SJ | title = Small unstable apoptotic protein, an apoptosis-associated protein, suppresses proliferation of myeloid cells | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pages = 705‚Äì12 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12566317 | url = http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/63/3/705.full }}&lt;/ref&gt; SUAP later attained its current designation as YPEL3 (Yippee like three), after it was discovered to be one of five human genes possessing [[homology (biology)|homology]] with the Drosophila Yippee protein.&lt;ref name="Source1"/&gt;

== Discovery ==

The Drosophilia Yippee protein was originally discovered in a yeast interaction trap screen when it was found to physically interact with ''Hyalophora cecropia'' [[Hemolin]].  After subsequent cloning and sequencing experiments Yippee was found to be a conserved gene family of proteins present in a diverse range of [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms, ranging from fungi to humans.&lt;ref name="Source5"/&gt; When analyzed at the [[amino acid]] level,  Drosophila melanogaster Yippee and YPEL1 displayed a high level of homology (76%). During later sequence analysis of human [[chromosome 22]], researchers identified a gene family ''YPEL1-YPEL5'', which had high homology with the Drosophila ''Yippee'' gene.&lt;ref name="Source1"/&gt;

YPEL3‚Äôs role as a novel tumor suppressor and its involvement in cellular proliferation were discovered during experiments to investigate [[p53]] dependent cell cycle arrest. While investigating the p53 [[tumor suppressor]] protein, [[microarray]] studies which targeted Hdmx and [[Mdm2|Hdm2]], both p53 negative regulators, revealed YPEL3 as a potential p53 regulated gene in [[MCF7]] breast cancer cells.&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; Investigation into its function led to the discovery of YPEL3 being a novel protein whose growth suppressive activity is thought to be mediated through a [[cellular senescence]] pathway.&lt;ref name="Source3"/&gt;

== Function ==

=== Regulation by p53 ===

[[p53]] is a tumor suppressor protein encoded by the human gene ''TP53'' whose function is to prevent unregulated cell growth.  p53 can be activated in response to a wide variety of cellular stressors, both [[oncogenic]] and non-oncogenic.   An important checkpoint in a complex pathway, activated p53 has been shown to bind [[DNA]] and transcriptionally regulate genes that can mediate a variety of cellular growth processes including [[DNA repair]], growth arrest, [[cellular senescence]] and [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="Source6"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Levine AJ, Oren M | title = The first 30 years of p53: growing ever more complex | journal = Nature Reviews Cancer | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 749‚Äì58 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19776744 | pmc = 2771725 | doi = 10.1038/nrc2723 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of functioning p53 in the regulation of the cell cycle is evident in that 55% of human cancers exhibit p53 mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hollstein M, Sidransky D, Vogelstein B, Harris CC | title = P53 mutations in human cancers | journal = Science | volume = 253 | issue = 5015 | pages = 49‚Äì53 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1905840 | doi = 10.1126/science.1905840 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1230948/files/article.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

YPEL3 was discovered to be a possible p53 target after a screen for such genes was performed in [[MCF7]] breast cancer cells following [[RNAi]] knockdown of p53 negative inhibitors.&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt;  In both human normal and tumor cell lines, YPEL3 has been shown to be a p53-inducible gene. Two putative p53 binding sites have been identified, one 1.3-Kbp 5' of the YPEL3 promoter and another upstream of the YPEL3 [[promoter (biology)|promoter]].&lt;ref name="Source1"/&gt;

=== Cellular senescence ===

As a part of the p53 pathway response and its anti-proliferation role, cellular [[senescence]] has gained attention for its working relationship with [[tumor suppressor]] genes.&lt;ref name="Source7"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ventura A, Kirsch DG, McLaughlin ME, Tuveson DA, Grimm J, Lintault L, Newman J, Reczek EE, Weissleder R, Jacks T | title = Restoration of p53 function leads to tumour regression in vivo | journal = Nature | volume = 445 | issue = 7128 | pages = 661‚Äì5 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17251932 | doi = 10.1038/nature05541 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Characterized by the limited ability of cultured normal cells to divide, senescence has been shown to be triggered through oncogenic activation( premature senescence) as well as telomere shortening as the result of successive rounds of DNA replication (replicative senescence).&lt;ref name="Source8"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Campisi J | title = Senescent Cells, Tumor Suppression, and Organismal Aging: Good Citizens, Bad Neighbors | journal = Cell | volume = 120 | issue = 4 | pages = 513‚Äì22 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15734683 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2005.02.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognized hallmarks of cellular senescence include senescence associated(SA)beta galactosidase staining and the appearance of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci(SAHF) within the nuclei of senescent cells.&lt;ref name="Source9"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dimri GP, Lee X, Basile G, Acosta M, Scott G, Roskelley C, Medrano EE, Linskens M, Rubelj I, Pereira-Smith O | title = A Biomarker that Identifies Senescent Human Cells in Culture and in Aging Skin in vivo | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 92 | issue = 20 | pages = 9363‚Äì7 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7568133 | pmc = 40985 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.92.20.9363 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Source10"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Narita M, N≈©nez S, Heard E, Narita M, Lin AW, Hearn SA, Spector DL, Hannon GJ, Lowe SW | title = Rb-Mediated Heterochromatin Formation and Silencing of E2F Target Genes during Cellular Senescence | journal = Cell | volume = 113 | issue = 6 | pages = 703‚Äì16 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12809602 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00401-X  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although studies in murine myeloid precursor cell lines indicated YPEL3 to have a role in apoptosis, human YPEL3 failed to demonstrate an apoptotic response using sub-G1 or poly ADP ribose polymerase cleavage as accepted indicators of programmed cell death.&lt;ref name="Source4"/&gt;  YPEL3 has been shown to trigger premature senescence when studied in IMR90 primary human [[fibroblasts]]. Studies in U2OS osteosarcoma cells and [[MCF7]] breast cancer cells have also demonstrated increased cellular senescence upon YPEL3 induction.&lt;ref name="Source3"/&gt;  As further possible evidence to its function, reduced expression of YPEL3 has been observed in ovarian, lung, and colon tumor cell lines.&lt;ref name="Source3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tuttle R, Simon M, Hitch DC, Maiorano JN, Hellan M, Ouellette J, Termuhlen P, Berberich SJ | title = Senescence-Associated Gene Ypel3 is Downregulated in Human Colon Tumors | journal = Annals of Surgical Oncology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 1791‚Äì6 | date = 18 June 2011 | pmid = 21267786 | doi = 10.1245/s10434-011-1558-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epigenetic modification ===

[[Epigenetics]] is the study of changes in gene activity that do not involve alterations to genetic code, or [[DNA]]. Instead, just above the [[genome]] sits various epigenetic markers which serve to provide instructions to activate or inactivate genes to varying degrees.  This silencing or activation of genes has been recognized to play an important role in the differentiation of nascent cells and several human disease states including [[cancer]]. Unlike genetic [[mutations]], epigenetic changes are considered reversible, although further study is needed.

Two common methods of epigenetic modification are [[DNA methylation]] and histone modification.  Specifically, hypermethylation of [[CpG islands]]( guanine and cytosine rich spans of DNA) near the promoters of tumor suppressor genes have been documented in specific tumor cell lines. In the case of  the tumor suppressors [[VHL]] (associated with von Hippel‚ÄìLindau disease), [[p16 (gene)|p16]], hMLH1, and [[BRCA1]](a gene associated with breast cancer susceptibility), hypermethylation of the CpG-island  has been shown to be a method of gene inactivation.&lt;ref name="Source11"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Esteller M | title = Epigenetics in Cancer | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 358 | issue = 11 | pages = 1148‚Äì59 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18337604 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra072067 | url = http://www.gpce.com.au/RXAU/RXAU_GPCE/documents/melbourne/alm-c/almc-wk.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both histone acetylation and DNA methylation have been studied as possible epigenetic means of regulating YPEL3 expression. When studied in Cp70 ovarian carcinoma cells, hypermethylation of a [[CpG island]] immediately upstream of the YPEL3 promoter has been seen to down regulate YPEL3 expression.&lt;ref name="Source3"/&gt; Hypermethylation seen in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes are cancer type specific, allowing each tumor type to be identifiable with an individual pattern.&lt;ref name="Source12"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Costello JF, Fr√ºhwald MC, Smiraglia DJ, Rush LJ, Robertson GP, Gao X, Wright FA, Feramisco JD, Peltom√§ki P, Lang JC, Schuller DE, Yu L, Bloomfield CD, Caligiuri MA, Yates A, Nishikawa R, Su Huang H, Petrelli NJ, Zhang X, O'Dorisio MS, Held WA, Cavenee WK, Plass C | title = Aberrant CpG-island methylation has non-random and tumour-type-specific patterns | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 132‚Äì8 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10655057 | doi = 10.1038/72785 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such discoveries have led researchers to investigate epigenetic markers as potential diagnostic tools, prognostic factors, and indicators for the responsiveness to treatment of human cancers, although continued study is needed.&lt;ref name="Source11"/&gt;
