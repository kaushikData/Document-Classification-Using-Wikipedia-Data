'''Acharya Shivpujan Sahay''' (9 August 1893 – 21 January 1963) was a noted [[Hindi]] [[novelist]], [[editing|editor]] and [[prose]] [[writer]].

== Personal life ==

Shivpujan Sahay was born in a [[middle class]] [[Kayastha]] land-owning family in the Unwans village of [[Buxar district, Bihar|Bhojpur District]] on 9 August 1893. His childhood name was 'Bholanath'. His early education was in village 'pathshalas'.

==Education and career==
[[File:Acharya Shivpujan Sahay's Letter.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Acharya Shivpujan Sahay's Letter to [[Ramesh Chandra Jha]]]]

After his early education and a short stint as a Hindi language teacher at [[Ara, Jharkhand|Ara]] (1903–1921), Acharya Shivpujan Sahay went to [[Kolkata]] to edit 'Marwari Sudhar' and then joined ''Matwala'' as an Editor in 1923. He moved to [[Lucknow]] in 1924 to join the editorial department of Dularelal Bhargava's ''Madhuri'' where he worked with noted Hindi author Munshi [[Premchand]] and edited his ''Rangbhumi'' and some of his other stories.

In 1925, he returned to [[Calcutta]] and engaged in editing short-lived journals such as ''Samanway'', ''Mauji'', ''Golmal'',''Upanyas Tarang''. Finally, Sahay moved to [[Varanasi]] (Kāśi) in 1926 to work as a [[Freelancer|freelance]] editor. For a short period in 1931, he went to [[Sultanganj]] near [[Bhagalpur]] to edit ''Ganga''. However, he returned to Varanasi in 1932 where he was commissioned to edit ''Jagaran'', a literary fortnightly brought out by [[Jaishankar Prasad]] and his circle of friends. Sahay once again found himself working with Premchand. He also went on to become a prominent member of the [[Nagari Pracharini Sabha]] and similar literary circles in [[Varanasi]].

In 1935, he moved to Laheria Sarai with his family ([[Darbhanga]]) to work as editor of ''Balak'' and other publications of Pustak Bhandar owned by [[Acharya Ramlochan Saran]]. In 1939, he joined Rajendra College, [[Chhapra]] as a Professor of Hindi Language. In 1946, on a year's leave, he moved to [[Patna]] to edit ''Himalaya'', a literary monthly which was published by Pustak Bhandar owned by [[Acharya Ramlochan Saran]].

In 1950, Sahay finally came to Patna to work as Secretary of Bihar Rashtra Bhasha Parished, a government academy where he edited and published more than 50  volumes of Hindi reference works. Later he became Director of the Parishad and compiled and edited ''Hindi Sahitya Aur Bihar'' a literary history. He retired from Parishad in 1959.

His own works were compiled and published in 4 volumes of ''Shipujan Rachanavali'' (1956–59) by the Parishad. Later, after his death, his complete works were edited and published by his son Prof. Mangal Murty as 'Shivapoojan Sahay Sahitya samagra'(2011) in 10 volumes.  Shivpujan Sahay is also remembered for his editing of several literary commemoration volumes, chiefly ''Dwivedi Abhinandan Granth'' (1933),''Anugrah Abhinandan Granth'' (1946), ''Rajendra Abhinandan Granth'' (1950) and ''Jayanti Smarak Granth'' (1942). He also edited Dr. [[Rajendra Prasad]]'s ''Atmakatha''. He was awarded [[Padma Bhushan]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |title=Padma Awards |publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India |date=2015 |accessdate=21 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6U68ulwpb?url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |archivedate=15 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Act structure''' explains how the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] of a [[film]]’s story is composed. Just like [[Play (theatre)|plays]] (staged drama) have 'acts', critics and [[screenwriters]] tend to divide films into acts; though films don't require to be physically broken down as such in reality.

Whereas plays are actual performances that need 'breaks' in the middle for change of set, costume, or for the artists' rest, films are recorded performances shown mechanically and therefore don't need actual breaks. Still they are divided into acts for reasons that are in aesthetic and structural conformation with the original idea of Act in theatre. Act breaks in a film are usually very obscure for lay audience, and only a trained person can detect the ending of one act and the beginning of another in the progression of a movie, although learned people can typically mark it by a '[[plot point]]' in writing process or film appreciation. The idea of act structure is of more value in [[screenwriting]] (i.e. while writing a [[screenplay]]) than watching a film, though the act breaks are never actually written in the final copies of screenplays, unlike in play scripts, where they are clearly mentioned as such; e.g. Act 1 Scene 3, etc. However, in television scripts called [[teleplay]]s, clear denotations about act breaks are almost always included, usually to coincide with commercial breaks.

Act is the broadest structural unit of enacted stories. The most common paradigm in theatre, and so in films, is that of the [[three-act structure]] proposed by [[Aristotle]]. Simply put, it means that any story has a 'beginning', a 'middle' and an 'end'. [[Playwrights]] and screenwriters divide their stories into three major parts viz. 'Set up', 'Confrontation' (alternatively called 'conflict' or 'complication') and 'Resolution'. These form the basic three acts of any performance – staged or screened.

Though various theories have been proposed and debated, the three-act structure stands as the most popular one. Also, this is what [[Hollywood]] has discovered and proved as the most successful in commercial movie making.

== The 'three-act structure' ==
{{main|Three-act structure}}
Native forms (including feature films) can often be seen in distinct parts called 'acts'.

It follows that the enacted story opens with the introduction of characters and situations, backdrop, locale etc. It creates interest in the audience and takes them to feel concerned as to what the real problem is and what may happen with it. Plays, and screenplays, usually revolve around main [[Character (arts)|characters]] – the '[[Protagonist]]' and the '[[Antagonist]]' who engage themselves into a battle. That is '''"Set up"'''.

The next part – and considered to be the most important – is complication of the problem of the story. It intrigues the audience all the more, giving them more and more information and putting various points of view for imaginative comparison. This eventually leads to higher points of audience interest. Because this second act of most screenplays add all the possible dramatic values to the plot, this is considered to be the core part of a [[Script (recorded media)|script]]. The antagonist and the protagonist try and experiment with all their strengths (and weaknesses of the other) to win the battle. That is '''"Confrontation".'''

This takes us to the third act, the '''"Resolution".''' This means it tends to 'solve' the problem (-s) of the story developed so far. But this is not obvious, as it is expected to bring the '[[Climax (narrative)|climax]]' (or a series of climaxes) to give the audience the pay-off. The tool usually implemented is a 'do or die' situation where doors of escape for either or both of the two characters go on closing one by one, leaving them with only a thin chance that demands the fullest exploitation of their qualities and energies. This so-called jaw-dropping, breath-taking, arm-rest-grabbing 'obligatory moment' for the audience leads to the final outcome of the entire plot. And it is usually the triumph of the good ([[Protagonist]]) over the evil ([[Antagonist]]), with rare exceptions.

== Limitations ==

This framework can not be rigidly applied to all the film stories, and there are a good proportion of Hollywood movies that defy this theory. Many films follow this pattern only to a subtle extent, where their [[genre]] demands a more delicate handling. Screenwriters and [[script doctor]]s have tried to provide alternative ideas, which again are open for debate. As alluded to previously, cinematic framework varies geographically and, through time, cinema has evolved unique approaches to storytelling. Also, this theory may not be fit for [[non-fiction]] films like [[Documentary film|documentary]] or corporate films, which may not have a '[[Plot (narrative)|plot]]' at their base with 'characters' and all their 'actions and speeches' predecided, like the [[feature films]] have. Such non-fiction films require their own forms of arrangement.

What is important here is that ideas of Act structure help us understand films better. More importantly, these are 'tools' of the screenplay writers who can break down the story at hand and play with various ways of presenting it to find the best possible one. Experts have gone long way ahead in dividing plot to even smaller structural units and they keep working to find the most effective formula of structuring a film story.

The '''Ahom language''' is a nearly extinct [[Tai language]] spoken by the [[Ahom people]] who ruled the [[Brahmaputra]] river valley in the present day [[India]]n state of [[Assam]] between the 13th and the 18th centuries. The language is classified in a Northwestern subgrouping of [[Southwestern Tai languages|Southwestern Tai]] owing to close affinities with [[Shan language|Shan]], [[Khamti language|Khamti]] and, more distantly, [[Thai language|Thai]]. As the Ahom rulers of the area assimilated with other indigenous  Assamese communities, they slowly adopted the [[Assamese language]](the lingua-franca of the region) as their mother tongue which gradually replaced Ahom as a spoken language, a process which became complete during the 19th century. As of 2000, Ahom was only known by approximately 200 priests of the traditional Ahom religion and only used for ceremonial or ritualistic purposes.

Although the language is no longer spoken, the exhaustive 1795 Ahom-Assamese lexicon known as the ''Bar Amra'' preserves the form of the language that was spoken during the [[Ahom Kingdom]]. Ahom is an important language in Tai studies. It was relatively free of both [[Mon-Khmer languages|Mon-Khmer]] and [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] influences and has a written tradition dating back to the 13th century.

== Language characteristics ==
Ahom is classified as a Southwestern Tai language. It has its own [[Ahom script|script]].
Ahom has characteristics typical of Tai languages, such as:

* Subject Verb Object (SVO) word order &lt;ref name="Diller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blake" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buragohain|first=Dipima|date=2011|title=Issues of Language Contact and Shift in Tai Ahom|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311770517_Issues_of_Language_Contact_and_Shift_in_Tai_Ahom}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tonality  &lt;ref name="Diller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blake" /&gt;&lt;ref name="French" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Monosyllabic roots &lt;ref name="Diller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blake" /&gt;&lt;ref name="French" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hongladarom"&gt;Hongladarom, K. (2005). Thai and Tai Languages. In ''Encyclopedia of linguistics'' (Vol. 2, pp. 1098-1101). New York, NY: Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Each syllable is tonal, and begins with a consonant or consonant cluster. A vowel or diphthong follows. A final consonant may be added, but is not necessary.&lt;ref name="Hongladarom" /&gt;
* Lack of inflection  &lt;ref name="Diller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="French" /&gt;
* Analytic syntax &lt;ref name="Blake"&gt;Blake, B. J. (1994). Language Classification. In ''The Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics'' (Vol. 4, pp. 1952-1957). New York, NY: Pergamon Press Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
When speaking and writing Ahom, much is dependent upon context and the audience interpretation. Multiple parts of the sentence can be left out; verb and adjectives will remain, but other parts of speech, especially pronouns, can be dropped. Verbs do not have tenses, and nouns do not have plurals. Time periods can be identified by adverbs, strings of verbs, or auxiliaries placed before the verb.&lt;ref name="Hongladarom" /&gt;
Ahom, like other Tai languages, uses classifiers to identify categories, and repetitions of words to express idiomatic expressions. However, the expressions, classifiers, pronouns, and other sentence particles vary between the Tai languages descended from Proto-Tai, making Tai languages mutually unintelligible.&lt;ref name="Hongladarom" /&gt;

== History of the language ==
The immediate parent language from which Ahom is descended has been reconstructed as [[Proto-Tai language|Proto-Tai]], a language from 2000 years ago,&lt;ref name="French"&gt;French, M. A. (1994). Tai Languages. In ''The Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics'' (Vol. 4, pp. 4520-4521). New York, NY: Pergamon Press Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hongladarom" /&gt; in the [[Tai–Kadai languages|Tai–Kadai]] family (unrelated to Chinese, but possibly related to the [[Austronesian languages]]),&lt;ref name="Blake" /&gt; within the (proposed but debated) subgroup of [[Kam–Tai languages|Kam–Tai]],&lt;ref name="Hongladarom" /&gt; although some say that Tai languages are a discrete family, and are not part of Tai–Kadai.&lt;ref name="French" /&gt;

The Ahom people and their language originated in [[Yunnan]] in south-west [[China]] and they migrated, from the border between Northern Vietnam and the Guangxi province of China,&lt;ref name="French" /&gt; into the south-east Asian peninsula and northern [[Burma]].
Ahom was then spoken by the [[Ahom people]] who ruled most of [[Assam]], a civilization in the Brahmaputra river valley, in Southeast Asia,&lt;ref name="Diller"&gt;Diller, A. (1993). Tai Languages. In ''International Encyclopedia of Linguistics'' (Vol. 4, pp. 128-131). Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; from 1228 to 1826. It was the exclusive court language of the [[Ahom kingdom]] till about the 15th&amp;ndash;16th century, when it gave way to [[Assamese language|Assamese]], a language formed out of a mixture of Austric, Tibeto-Burmese, Tai, Indo-Chinese and Aryan language. The language fell into complete disuse by the 19th century&lt;ref name="Hongladarom" /&gt; and the phonology has completely been lost. The language today is used chiefly for liturgical purposes, and is no longer used in daily life. It retains cultural significance and is used for religious chants and to read literature.&lt;ref name="Diller" /&gt; An effort has been made to revive the language by following the phonology of existing sister languages, especially [[Tai Aiton language|Tai-Aiton]] and [[Tai Phake language|Tai-Phake]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14269">In [[medicine]], a '''case report''' is a detailed report of the [[symptom]]s, [[medical sign|sign]]s, [[diagnosis]], treatment, and follow-up of an individual [[patient]]. Case reports may contain a [[demographic profile]] of the patient, but usually describe an unusual or novel occurrence. Some case reports also contain a [[literature review]] of other reported cases. Case reports are professional narratives that provide feedback on clinical practice guidelines and offer a framework for early signals of effectiveness, [[Adverse effect|adverse events]], and cost. They can be shared for medical, scientific, or educational purposes.

== Types ==
Most case reports are on one of six topics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Debra Volkland |author2=Robert L. Iles |title=Guidebook to better medical writing |publisher=Island Press |location=Washington, DC |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=0-9661831-0-X |oclc=41579709 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* An unexpected association between [[disease]]s or [[symptom]]s.
* An unexpected event in the course of observing or treating a patient.
* Findings that shed new light on the possible [[pathogenesis]] of a disease or an adverse effect.
* Unique or rare features of a disease.
* Unique therapeutic approaches.
* A positional or quantitative variation of the anatomical structures.

== Roles in research and education ==
A case report is generally considered a type of [[anecdotal evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Aronson JK | title=Anecdotes as evidence | journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7403 |pages=1346 |date=June 2003  | pmid=12816800 | pmc=1126236 | doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7403.1346 | url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given their intrinsic [[methodological]] limitations, including lack of [[statistical sampling]], case reports are placed at the foot of the [[hierarchy of evidence|hierarchy of clinical evidence]], together with [[case series]].&lt;ref name=Greenhalgh-HowToRead&gt;{{cite journal |author=Greenhalgh T |title=How to read a paper. Getting your bearings (deciding what the paper is about) |journal=BMJ |volume=315 |issue=7102 |pages=243–6 |date=July 1997  |pmid=9253275 |pmc=2127173 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.315.7102.243|url= |issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, case reports do have genuinely useful roles in [[medical research]] and [[evidence-based medicine]].&lt;ref name=Gagnier2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gagnier JJ, Kienle G, Altman DG, Moher D, Sox H, Riley D |title=The CARE guidelines: consensus-based clinical case reporting guideline development |journal=Headache |volume=53 |issue=10 |pages=1541–7 |year=2013 |pmid=24266334 |doi=10.1111/head.12246 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/head.12246/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they have facilitated recognition of new diseases and adverse effects of treatments.&lt;ref name=Aronson2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aronson JK, Hauben M |title=Anecdotes that provide definitive evidence |journal=BMJ |volume=333 |issue=7581 |pages=1267–9 |date=December 2006  |pmid=17170419 |pmc=1702478 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39036.666389.94 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (For example, recognition of the link between administration of [[thalidomide]] to mothers and malformations in their babies was triggered by the report of a particular case.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/illustrating/articles/thalidomide-an-unanticipated-adverse-effect |title=Thalidomide and congenital abnormalities |format= |work= |publisher=James Lind Library | accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Case reports have a role in [[pharmacovigilance]].&lt;ref name=Aronson2006/&gt; They can also help understand the clinical spectrum of [[rare diseases]], as well as unusual presentations of common diseases.&lt;ref name=Gagnier2013/&gt; They can help generate study [[hypotheses]], including plausible [[pathogenesis|mechanisms of disease]].&lt;ref name=Gagnier2013/&gt; Case reports may also have a role to play in guiding the [[Personalized medicine|personalization]] of treatments in clinical practice.&lt;ref name=Gagnier2013/&gt;

Proponents of case reports have outlined some particular advantages of the format. Case reports and series have a high sensitivity for detecting novelty and therefore remain one of the cornerstones of medical progress; they provide many new ideas in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vandenbroucke JP |title=In defense of case reports and case series |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=134 |issue=4 |pages=330–4 |date=February 2001 |pmid=11182844 |doi= 10.7326/0003-4819-134-4-200102200-00017|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas [[randomized clinical trial]]s usually only inspect one variable or very few variables, rarely reflecting the full picture of a complicated medical situation, the case report can detail many different aspects of the patient's [[medicine|medical]] situation (e.g. [[patient history]], [[physical examination]], [[diagnosis]], [[psychosocial]] aspects, follow up).&lt;ref name="Yitschaky, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yitschaky O, Yitschaky M, Zadik Y |title=Case report on trial: Do you, Doctor, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? |journal=J Med Case Reports |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=179 |date=May 2011 |pmid=21569508 |url=http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/pdf/1752-1947-5-179.pdf| format=PDF|doi=10.1186/1752-1947-5-179 |pmc=3113995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because typical, unremarkable cases are less likely to be published, use of case reports as scientific evidence must take into account [[publication bias]]. Some case reports also contain an extensive review of the relevant literature on the topic at-hand (and sometimes a [[systematic review]] of available evidence). Reports adopting this sort of approach can be identified by terms such as a "case report and review of the literature". Reports containing broader active research such as this might be considered [[case studies]] in the true definition of the term.

Case reports can also play a relevant role in medical education, providing a structure for [[Case-based reasoning|case-based]] learning.&lt;ref name=Gagnier2013/&gt;

A particular attraction of case reports is the possibility of quick publication (with respect to more extensive studies such as randomized control trials), allowing them to act as a kind of rapid short communication between busy clinicians who may not have the time or resources to conduct large scale research.&lt;ref name="Yitschaky, 2011"/&gt;

== Reporting guidelines ==
The quality of the scientific reporting of case reports is variable, and sub-optimal reporting hinders the use of case reports to inform research design or help guide clinical practice.&lt;ref name=Gagnier2013/&gt; In response to these issues, reporting guidelines are under development to facilitate greater transparency and completeness in the provision of relevant information for individual cases.&lt;ref name=Gagnier2013/&gt; The CARE (i.e. CAse REport) guidelines include a reporting checklist that is listed on the [[EQUATOR Network]],&lt;ref name=EQUATOR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/care/ |title=The CARE Guidelines: Consensus-based Clinical Case Reporting Guideline Development | publisher=The EQUATOR Network |format= |work= |accessdate=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; an international initiative aimed at promoting transparent and accurate reporting of health research studies to enhance the value and reliability of medical research literature. This 13-item checklist includes indications regarding the title, key words, [[abstract (summary)|abstract]], introduction, patient information, clinical findings, timeline, diagnostic assessment, therapeutic interventions, follow-up and outcomes, discussion, patient perspective, and [[informed consent]].&lt;ref name=Gagnier2013/&gt; An explanation and elaboration article (a manual for writing case reports following the CARE guidelines) was published in the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology in 2017.

== Publishing ==
Many international journals will publish case reports, but they restrict the number that appear in the print run because this has an adverse effect on the journal's  [[impact factor]]. Case reports are often put in the internet part of the journal and there is often still a [[paywall|requirement for a subscription]] to access them. However, there are a few that are devoted to publishing case reports alone, and these are all [[open access]]. The first of these to start publishing, in 2001, was ''Grand Rounds''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grandroundsjournal.com/ |title=Online open peer-reviewed case report journal  |format= |work=Grand Rounds |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar journals include ''Case Reports in Medicine'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/crim/ |title=Case Reports in Medicine |format= |work=hindawi |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Journal of Medical Case Reports]]'', ''Oncology Reports'', ''Oncology Letters'' and ''[[Cases Journal]]''; all of them publish [[peer-review]]ed case reports in all areas of medicine. ''Cases Journal'' recently merged with the ''Journal of Medical Case Reports'' but still maintains an independent internet portal. ''[[BMJ]] Case Reports'' is an online, peer-reviewed journal publishing cases in all disciplines. ''Radiology Case Reports''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radiology.casereports.net |title=Radiology Case Reports |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Journal of Radiology Case Reports''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiologycases.com |title=Case Reports |format= |work=Journal of Radiology Case Reports |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704190145/http://www.radiologycases.com/ |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are open-access peer-reviewed journals focusing on medical imaging. ''Journal of Surgical Case Reports''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jscr.co.uk |title=JSCR |format= |work=Journal of Surgical Case Reports |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an open access peer-reviewed journal that considers case reports in the field of surgery. ''Journal of Orthopaedic Case Reports''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jocr.co.in/wp/ |title=Journal of Orthopaedic Case Reports |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an open access, peer-reviewed journal. ''Oncology Reports'' and ''Oncology Letters'' both publish case reports exclusively as open access, peer-reviewed journals in the field of oncology and cancer medicine. ''Human Pathology: Case Reports'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanpathologycasereports.com/ |title=Human Pathology: Case Reports |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an open access, peer-reviewed journal publishing all aspects of pathology, regardless of the system affected.

There are a number of websites that allow patients to submit and share their own patient case reports with other people. [[PatientsLikeMe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.patientslikeme.com |title=Treatment and Side Effect Information |format= |work=Patients Like You |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Treatment Report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treatmentreport.com |title=Share and Find Treatment Reviews for Medical Conditions |format= |work=Treatment Report |accessdate= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729205207/http://www.treatmentreport.com/# |archive-date=2016-07-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are two such sites.

== Use of terminology outside science  ==
The term is also used to describe non-scientific reports usually prepared for educational reasons.
but at times, not usually considered to be standard of high level reporting system.

== Famous scientific case reports ==
* [[Sigmund Freud]] reported on numerous cases, including [[Anna O.]], [[Dora (case study)|Dora]], [[Oedipus complex#Little Hans: a case study by Freud|Little Hans]], [[Rat Man]], and [[Sergei Pankejeff|Wolf Man]]
* [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]] reported on "[[Joseph Merrick|The Elephant Man]]"
* [[Paul Broca]] reported on language impairment following left hemisphere lesions in the 1860s.
* [[Joseph Jules Dejerine]] reported on a case of [[pure alexia]].
* [[William MacIntyre]] reported on a case of [[multiple myeloma]] (described in the 1840s).
* [[Christiaan Barnard]] described the world's first [[heart transplant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grandrounds-e-med.com/articles/grHist-001.htm |title=Cardiac transplantation: since the first case report |work=Grand Rounds |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023181415/http://www.grandrounds-e-med.com/articles/grHist-001.htm |archivedate=2010-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a case report

[[File:Prints Pigment Giclee.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An image printed with a CcMmYKk ink set, on both paper and canvas stock.  The ink cartridges used are also shown.]]

'''CcMmYK''', sometimes referred to as '''CMYKLcLm''' or '''CMYKcm''', is a six color printing process used in some [[inkjet printer]]s optimized for photo printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Art of Fine Art Printing: Using today’s Inkjet Printers for Quality Prints | author = Uwe Steinmueller and Juergen Gulbins | publisher = Uwe Steinmueller | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-9787497-0-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xInmHAAJroAC&amp;pg=PT36&amp;ots=uoTdJlWEth&amp;dq=CcMmYK&amp;ei=Kfm7Ro2YJaDeoALSidXvBQ&amp;sig=4pr0Tp7f_YRmZRug3wM9FaVtICY }}&lt;/ref&gt; It complements the more common four color [[CMYK]] process, which stands for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Key (black), by adding light [[cyan]] and light [[magenta]]. Individually, light cyan is often abbreviated to Lc or c, and light magenta is represented as Lm or m.

== Advantages of CcMmYK over CMYK ==

The most noticeable result of using light cyan and light magenta inks is the removal of a distinct and harsh [[halftoning]] dot appearance that appears in prints that use light shades of cyan or magenta on the pure [[CMYK]] ink configuration. Usually when printing a dark color the printer will saturate the area with colored ink dots, but will use fewer ink dots to create the effect of a light color. The result is hard to notice with yellow because yellow is perceived as a very light color. However, the individual cyan and magenta ink dots will stand out in a sparse pattern due to their darker color against a white background; the result is undesirable when it is noticed.

By using light cyan or magenta, the printer can saturate areas that would typically use halftoning with these inks to remove the look of sparse magenta and cyan dots. The downside is the printer needs approximately twice as much light cyan and magenta ink in areas to achieve the same saturation as pure cyan/magenta which can lead to excess ink usage. The end result, however, is significantly better for some photos.

CcMmYK colorants reduce graininess in the middle tone region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Son|first=Chang-Hwan|title=Color Imaging IX: Processing, Hardcopy, and Applications|year=2004|publisher=SPIE and IS&amp;T|pages=110–120|url=http://cilab.knu.ac.kr/publication/%EA%B5%AD%EB%82%B4%EC%99%B8%20%EC%BB%A8%ED%8D%BC%EB%9F%B0%EC%8A%A4/2004/%EA%B5%AD%EC%99%B8/six%20color%20separation%20for%20improving%20graininess%20in%20a%20middle%20tone%20region.pdf |author2=Yun-Tae Kim |author3=Cheol-Hee Lee |author4=Yeong-Ho Ha|editor=Reiner Eschbach|accessdate=2013-07-16|archiveurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This reduced graininess typically improves the photographic appearance of blue skies and some flesh tones.

The {{nihongo|'''Charter Oath'''|五箇条の御誓文|Gokajō no Goseimon|more literally, the '''Oath in Five Articles'''}} was promulgated at the enthronement of [[Emperor Meiji]] of Japan on 6 April 1868 in [[Kyoto Imperial Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Keene, p. 137. Other translations are seen in the literature, such as '''Five-Article Oath''' or '''Charter Oath in Five Articles'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.meijijingu.or.jp/about/3-3.html 慶応４年（明治元年)３月１４日、明治天皇は京都御所紫宸殿に公卿・諸侯以下百官を集め、維新の基本方針を天地の神々にお誓いになりました。The Charter Oath was promulgated on the fourteenth day of the third month by the [[Japanese calendar#History|old calendar]], equivalent to April 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Oath outlined the main aims and the course of action to be followed during Emperor Meiji's reign, setting the legal stage for Japan's modernization. This also set up a process of urbanization as people of all classes were free to move jobs so people went to the city for better work. It remained influential, if less for governing than inspiring, throughout the [[Meiji era]] and into the twentieth century, and can be considered  the first [[constitution]] of modern Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Keene, p. 340, notes that one might "describe the Oath in Five Articles as a constitution for all ages."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
As the name implies, the text of the Oath consists of five clauses:

{{quotation|By this oath, we set up as our aim the establishment of the national wealth on a broad basis and the framing of a constitution and laws.

# Deliberative assemblies shall be widely established and all matters decided by open discussion.
# All classes, high and low, shall be united in vigorously carrying out the administration of affairs of state.
# The common people, no less than the civil and military officials, shall all be allowed to pursue their own calling so that there may be no discontent.
# Evil customs of the past shall be broken off  and everything based upon the just laws of Nature.
# Knowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to strengthen the foundation of imperial rule.&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, p. 8, quoted in De Bary ''et al.'', p. 672.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origin and subsequent influence==
The first draft of the Oath was written by junior councilor [[Yuri Kimimasa]] in January 1868, containing progressive language that spoke to the frustrations that the radical but modestly born Meiji leaders had experienced in "service to hereditary incompetents."&lt;ref name="Jansen 2002, p. 338"&gt;Jansen (2002), p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; Yuri's language was moderated by his colleague [[Fukuoka Takachika]] in February to be "less alarming," and [[Kido Takayoshi]] prepared the final form of the Oath, employing "language broad enough to embrace both readings."&lt;ref name="Jansen 2002, p. 338"/&gt; The Oath was read aloud by [[Sanjō Sanetomi]] in the main ceremonial hall of the [[Kyoto Imperial Palace]] in the presence of the Emperor and more than 400 officials. After the reading, the [[kuge|nobles]] and ''[[daimyō]]s'' present signed their names to a document praising the Oath, and swearing to do their utmost to uphold and implement it. Those not able to attend the formal reading afterwards visited the palace to sign their names, bringing the total number of signatures to 767.&lt;ref&gt;Keene, Meiji and His World, page 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the oath was both to issue a statement of policy to be followed by the post-[[Tokugawa shogunate]] government in the Meiji period, and to offer hope of inclusion in the next regime to pro-Tokugawa domains. This second motivation was especially important in the early stages of the [[Meiji Restoration|Restoration]] as a means to keep domains from joining the Tokugawa remnant in the [[Boshin War]]. Later, military victory "made it safe to begin to push court nobles and ''daimyō'' figureheads out of the way".{{attribution needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Jansen (2002), 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

The promise of reform in the document initially went unfulfilled: in particular, a parliament with real power was not established until 1890, and the [[Meiji oligarchy]] from [[Satsuma han|Satsuma]], [[Chōshū Domain|Chōshū]], [[Tosa Domain|Tosa]] and [[Hizen Domain|Hizen]] retained political and military control well into the 20th century. In general, the Oath was purposely phrased in broad terms to minimize resistance from the ''daimyōs'' and to provide "a promise of gradualism and equity":{{attribution needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Jansen (2002), p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|"Deliberative councils" and "public discourse" were, after all, terms that had been applied to cooperation between lords of great domains. That "all classes" were to unite indicated that there would continue to be classes. Even "commoners" were to be treated decently by "civil and military" officers, the privileged ranks of the recent past. No one was likely to be in favor of the retention of "evil customs"; a rather Confucian "Nature" would indicate the path to be chosen. Only in the promise to "seek knowledge throughout the world" was there a specific indication of change; but here, too, late Tokugawa activists had deplored the irrationality of Japan's two-headed government as the only one in the world. Moreover the search would be selective and purposeful, designed to "strengthen the foundations of imperial rule".&lt;ref&gt;Jansen (2002), p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Oath was reiterated as the first article of the constitution promulgated in June 1868, and the subsequent articles of that constitution expand the policies outlined in the Oath.&lt;ref&gt;De Bary ''et al.'', pp. 672–673.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost eighty years later, in the wake of the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[Emperor Hirohito]] paid homage to the Oath and reaffirmed it as the basis of [[kokutai|"national polity"]] in his [[Humanity Declaration]].&lt;ref&gt;De Bary ''et al.'', p. 1029. Jansen (2002), p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt; The ostensible purpose of the rescript was to appease the American occupiers with a renunciation of imperial divinity, but the emperor himself saw it as a statement of the existence of democracy in [[Meiji era]].&lt;ref&gt;Dower, 1999, pp. 314, 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

The internal '''classification of the [[Romance languages]]''' is a complex and sometimes controversial topic which may not have one single answer.  Several classifications have been proposed, based on different criteria.

==Variation among languages==

In spite of their common origin, the descendants of Vulgar Latin have many differences. These occur at all levels, including the sound systems, the orthography, the nominal, verbal, and adjectival inflections, the auxiliary verbs and the semantics of verbal tenses, the function words, the rules for subordinate clauses, and, especially, in their vocabularies. While most of those differences are clearly due to independent development after the breakup of the Roman Empire (including invasions and cultural exchanges), one must also consider the influence of prior languages in territories of Latin Europe that fell under Roman rule, and possible [[heterogeneity]] in Vulgar Latin itself.

Romanian, together with other related languages, like [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], has a number of grammatical features which are unique within Romance, but are shared with other non-Romance languages of the [[Balkans]], such as [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. These include, for example, the structure of the vestigial case system, the placement of articles as suffixes of the nouns (''{{wiktro|cer}}'' = "sky", ''{{wiktro|cerul}}'' = "the sky"), and several more. This phenomenon, called the [[Balkan language area]], may be due to contacts between those languages in post-Roman times.

===Formation of plurals===
{{Main|Romance plurals|La Spezia–Rimini Line}}
Some Romance languages form plurals by adding {{IPA|/s/}} (derived from the plural of the Latin accusative case), while others form the plural by changing the final vowel (by influence of Latin nominative plural endings, such as  {{IPA|/i/}}) from some  masculine nouns.
*Plural in {{IPA|/s/}}: Portuguese, Galician, Spanish, Catalan,&lt;ref&gt;Catalan plurals sometimes also involve a change in vowel (''la festa'' / ''les festes''). This is a secondary development, only found in the feminine; Catalan clearly belongs to the first set of languages, those in which plurals are formed by {{IPA|/s/}}, based on the Latin accusative.&lt;/ref&gt;  Occitan, Sardinian, Friulian, Romansh. 
*Vowel change: Italian, Romanian.
*Special case of French: Falls into the first group historically (and orthographically), but the final ''-s'' is no longer pronounced (except in [[liaison (linguistics)|liaison]] contexts), meaning that singular and plural nouns are usually homophonous in isolation. Many [[determiner (linguistics)|determiners]] have a distinct plural formed by both changing the vowel and allowing {{IPA|/z/}} in liaison.

===Words for "more"===
Some Romance languages use a version of Latin ''plus'', others a version of ''magis''.
*''Plus''-derived: French ''{{wiktfr|plus}}'' {{IPA|/plys/}}, Italian ''{{wiktit|più}}'' {{IPA|/pju/}}, Sardinian ''{{wiktsc|prus}}'' {{IPA|/ˈpruzu/}}, Piedmontese ''{{wiktpms|pi}}'', Lombard ''{{wiktlmo|pu}}'', Ligurian ''{{wiktlij|ciù}}'', Friulian ''{{wiktfur|plui}}'', Romansh ''{{wiktrm|pli}}'', Venetian ''{{wiktvec|pi}}''. In Catalan ''{{wiktca|pus}}'' {{IPA|/pus/}} is exclusively used on negative statements in Mallorcan Catalan dialect, and "{{wiktca|més}}" is the word mostly used.
*''Magis''-derived: Galician and Portuguese (''{{lang|gl|{{lang|pt|[[wikt:mais|mais]]}}}}''; medieval [[Galician-Portuguese]] had both words: ''mais'' and ''[[wikt:chus|chus]]''), Spanish (''{{wiktes|más}}''), Catalan (''{{wiktca|més}}''), Venetian (''{{wiktvec|massa}}'' or ''{{wiktvec|masa}}'', "too much") Occitan (''{{wiktoc|mai}}''), Romanian (''{{wiktro|mai}}'').

===Words for "nothing"===
Although the Classical Latin word for "nothing" is ''{{wiktla|nihil}}'', the common word for "nothing" became ''{{wiktit|nulla}}'' in Italian (from neuter plural ''nulla'', "no thing",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/nulla/ Entry ''nulla'' in Vocabolario Treccani] {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from ''nulla res'';&lt;ref name=Zanuttini&gt;R. Zanuttini, [http://lear.unive.it/bitstream/10278/2098/1/5-zanuttini.pdf Negazione e concordanza negativa in italiano e in piemontese]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian also has the word "{{wiktit|niente}}") ''{{wiktsc|nudda}}'' {{IPA|/nuɖːa/}} in Sardinian, ''{{lang|es|{{lang|pt|{{lang|gl|nada}}}}}}'' in Spanish,  Portuguese, and Galician (from ''(rem) natam'', "thing born";&lt;ref&gt;[http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=nada Entry ''nada'' in Diccionario de la lengua española] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galician also has the word "{{wiktgl|ren}}"), ''{{wiktfr|rien}}'' in French, ''{{wiktca|res}}'' in Catalan, ''{{wiktan|cosa}}'' and ''{{wiktan|res}}'' in Aragonese, ''{{wiktoc|ren}}'' in Occitan (from ''rem'', "thing",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/rien Entry ''rien'' in CNTRL] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or else from nominative ''res''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diccionari.cat/lexicx.jsp?GECART=0117642 Entry ''res'' in diccionari.cat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402122151/http://www.diccionari.cat/lexicx.jsp?GECART=0117642 |date=2015-04-02 }} {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{wiktro|nimic}}'' in Romanian, ''{{wiktrm|nagut}}'' in Romansh, ''{{lang|vec|{{lang|pms|gnente}}}}'' in Venetian and Piedmontese, ''{{wiktlmo|gnent}}'' and ''{{wiktlmo|nagott}}'' in Lombard, and ''{{wiktfur|nue}}'' and ''{{wiktfur|nuie}}'' in Friulian. Some argue that most roots derive from different parts of a Latin phrase ''nullam rem natam'' ("no thing born"), an emphatic idiom for "nothing".{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Meanwhile, Italian and Venetian ''niente'' and ''gnente'' would seem to be more logically derived from Latin ''ne(c) entem'' ("no being"), ''ne inde'' or, more likely, ''ne(c) (g)entem'', which also explains the French cognate word ''néant''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/niente/ Entry ''niente'' in Vocabolario Treccani] {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/n%C3%A9ant Entry ''néant'' in CNRTL] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Piedmontese negative adverb ''nen'' cames also directly from ''ne(c) (g)entem'',&lt;ref name=Zanuttini/&gt; while ''gnente'' is borrowed from Italian.&lt;!--"nulla omnia est divisa in partes tres", I suppose 8-, "NIHIL" meaning nothing in Latin, Romanian "nimic")--&gt;

===The number 16===
Romanian constructs the names of the numbers 11–19 by a regular Slavic-influenced pattern that could be translated as "one-over-ten", "two-over-ten", etc. All the other Romance languages use a pattern like "one-ten", "two-ten", etc. for 11–15, and the pattern "ten-and-seven, "ten-and-eight", "ten-and-nine" for 17–19. For 16, however, they split into two groups: some use "six-ten", some use "ten-and-six":
*"Sixteen": Italian ''sedici'', Catalan and Occitan ''setze'', French ''seize'', Venetian ''sédexe'', Romansh ''sedesch'', Friulian ''sedis'', Lombard ''sedas / sedes'', Franco-Provençal ''sèze'', Sardinian ''sèighi'', Piedmontese ''sëddes'' (''sëddes'' is borrowed from Lombard and replaced the original ''sëzze'' since the 18th century, such as the numbers from 11 to 16, ''onze'' but now ''óndes'', ''dose'' but now ''dódes'', ''trëzze'' but now ''tërdes'', ''quatòrze'' but now ''quatòrdes'', ''quinze'' but now ''quìndes'').
*"Ten and six": Portuguese ''dezasseis'' or ''dezesseis'', Galician ''dezaseis'' (''decem ac sex''), Spanish ''dieciséis'' (romance construction: ''diez y seis''), the Marchigiano dialect ''digissei''.
*"Six over ten": Romanian ''șaisprezece'' (where ''spre'' derives from [[Latin]] ''super'').
Classical Latin uses the "one-ten" pattern for 11–17 (''ūndecim'', ''duodecim'', ... , ''septendecim''), but then switches to "two-off-twenty" (''duodēvigintī'') and "one-off-twenty" (''ūndēvigintī''). For the sake of comparison, note that English and German use two special words derived from "one left over" and "two left over" for 11 and 12, then the pattern "three-ten", "four-ten", ... , "nine-ten" for 13–19.

===To have and to hold===
The verbs derived from Latin ''habēre'' "to have", ''tenēre'' "to hold", and ''esse'' "to be" are used differently in the various Romance languages, to express possession, to construct perfect tenses, and to make [[Existential clause|existential statements]] ("there is"). If we use '''T''' for ''tenēre'', '''H''' for ''habēre'', and '''E''' for ''esse'', we have the following distribution:
*'''HHE''': Romanian, Italian, Gallo-Italic languages.
*'''HHH''': Occitan, French, Romansh, Sardinian.
*'''THH''': Spanish, Catalan, Aragonese.
*'''TTH''': European Portuguese.
*'''T-T''': Brazilian Portuguese (colloquial; perfect tense is constructed with ''já'' + preterite).

For example:

Ancient Galician-Portuguese used to employ the auxiliary '''H''' for permanent states, such as ''Eu hei um nome'' "I have a name" (i.e. for all my life), and '''T''' for non-permanent states ''Eu tenho um livro'' "I have a book" (i.e. perhaps not so tomorrow), but this construction is no longer used in modern Galician and Portuguese. Informal [[Brazilian Portuguese]] uses the '''T''' verb even in the existential sense, e.g. ''Tem água no copo'' "There is water in the glass".

Languages that have not [[Grammaticalization|grammaticalised]] *''tenēre'' have kept it with its original sense "hold", e.g. Italian ''tieni il libro'', French ''tu tiens le livre'', Romanian ''ține cartea'', Friulian ''Tu tu tegnis il libri'' "You're holding the book". The meaning of "hold" is also retained to some extent in Spanish and Catalan.

Romansh uses, besides ''igl ha'', the form ''i dat'' (literally: it gives), [[calque]]d from German ''es gibt''.&lt;!-- Swiss colloquial German tends to use ''es hat'', though, interestingly enough. --&gt;

===To have or to be===
Some languages use their equivalent of 'have' as an [[auxiliary verb]] to form the compound forms (e. g. French ''passé composé'') of all verbs; others use 'be' for some verbs and 'have' for others.
*'have' only: Standard Catalan, Spanish, Romanian, Sicilian.
*'have' and 'be': Occitan, French, Sardinian, Italian, Northern-Italian languages (Piedmontese, Lombard, Ligurian, Venetian, Friulan), Romansh, Central Italian languages (Tuscan, Umbrian, Corsican) some Catalan dialects (although such usage is recessing in those).
In the latter type, the verbs which use 'be' as an auxiliary are [[unaccusative verb]]s, that is, intransitive verbs that often show motion not directly initiated by the subject or changes of state, such as 'fall', 'come', 'become'. All other verbs (intransitive [[unergative verb]]s and all transitive verbs) use 'have'. For example, in French, ''J'ai vu'' or Italian ''ho visto'' 'I have seen' vs. ''Je suis tombé'', ''sono caduto'' 'I have (lit. am) fallen'. Note, however, the difference between French and Italian in the choice of auxiliary for the verb 'be' itself: Fr. ''J'ai été'' 'I have been' with 'have', but Italian ''sono stato'' with 'be'. In Southern Italian languages the principles governing auxiliaries can be quite complex, including even differences in persons of the subject. A similar distinction exists in the Germanic languages, which share a [[Sprachbund|language area]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}; German and the Scandinavian languages use 'have' and 'be', while modern English now uses 'have' only (although 'be' remains in certain relic phrases: ''Christ is risen'', ''Joy to the world: the Lord is come'').

"Be" is also used for reflexive forms of the verbs, as in French ''j'ai lavé'' 'I washed [something]', but ''je me suis lavé'' 'I washed myself', Italian ''ho lavato'' 'I washed [something]' vs. ''mi sono lavato'' 'I washed myself'.

Tuscan uses ''si'' forms identical to the 3rd person reflexive in a usage interpreted as 'we' subject, triggering 'be' as auxiliary in compound constructions, with the subject pronoun ''noi'' 'we' optional. If the verb employed is one that otherwise selects 'have' as auxiliary, the past participle is unmarked: ''si è lavorato'' = ''abbiamo lavorato'' 'we (have) worked'. If the verb is one that otherwise selects 'be', the past participle is marked plural: ''si è arrivati'' = ''siamo arrivati'' 'we (have) arrived'.

==Classification==
[[File:Romance-lg-classification-en.svg|thumb|500px|Chart of Romance languages based on structural and comparative criteria not on socio-functional ones. Based on the chart published in "Koryakov Y.B. Atlas of Romance languages. Moscow, 2001".]]

===Difficulties of classification===
The [[comparative method]] used by linguists to build family language trees is based on the assumption that the member languages evolved from a single [[proto-language]] by a sequence of binary splits, separated by many centuries. With that hypothesis, and the [[glottochronology|glottochronological]] assumption that the degree of linguistic change is roughly proportional to elapsed time, the sequence of splits can be deduced by measuring the differences between the members.

However, the history of Romance languages, as we know it, makes the first assumption rather problematic. While the [[Roman Empire]] lasted, its educational policies and the natural mobility of its soldiers and administrative officials probably ensured some degree of linguistic homogeneity throughout its territory. Even if there were differences between the [[Vulgar Latin]] spoken in different regions, it is doubtful whether there were any sharp boundaries between the various dialects. On the other hand, after the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|Empire's collapse]], the population of [[Latin]] speakers was separated—almost instantaneously, by the standards of [[historical linguistics]]—into a large number of politically independent states and feudal domains whose populations were largely bound to the land. These units then interacted, merged and split in various ways over the next fifteen centuries, possibly influenced by languages external to the family (as in the so-called [[Balkan language area]]).

To sum it up, the [[history of Latin]] and Romance-speaking peoples can hardly be described by a binary branching pattern; therefore, one may argue that any attempt to fit the Romance languages into a tree structure is inherently flawed.&lt;ref&gt;"Not only is the tree model inadequate to express the relationships between diatopically related varieties, but it may seriously distort the diachronic and synchronic study of language. Some would argue that this model works well within Indo-European linguistics, where the varieties under consideration (all written and therefore partially or fully standardized) are usually well separated in space and time and where the intervening varieties have all vanished without trace, removing any possibility of viewing the Indo-European family as a continuum. However, where the object of study is a series of now-existing varieties or a range of closely related varieties from the past, the tree model is open to a number of grave objections." ([[#penny|Penny 2000]]: 22).&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, the genealogical structure of languages forms a typical ''[[Linkage (linguistics)|linkage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"A linkage consists of separate modern languages which are all related and linked together by intersecting layers of innovations; it is a language family whose internal genealogy cannot be represented by any tree." ([[#linkage|François 2014]]:171).&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the tree structure may be meaningfully applied to any subfamilies of Romance whose members did diverge from a common ancestor by binary splits.  That may be the case, for example, of the dialects of Spanish and Portuguese spoken in different countries, or the regional variants of spoken [[Italian language|standard Italian]] (but not the so-called "[[Languages of Italy|Italian dialects]]", which are distinct languages evolved directly from Vulgar Latin).

===The standard proposal===
Nevertheless, by applying the comparative method, some linguists have concluded that the earliest split in the Romance family tree was between [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] and the remaining group, called Continental Romance.  Among the many peculiar Sardinian distinguishing features are its articles (derived from Latin ''IPSE'' instead of ''ILLE'') and retention of the "hard" sounds of "c" and "g" before "e" and "i". This view is challenged in part by the existence of definite articles continuing {{smallcaps|ipse}} forms (e.g. ''sa mar'' 'the sea') in some varieties of [[Catalan language|Catalan]], best known as typical of [[Balearic dialect]]s.

According to this view, the next split was between [[Romanian language|Romanian]] in the east, and the other languages (the [[Italo-Western languages]]) in the west. One of the characteristic features of Romanian is its retention of three of Latin's seven noun cases.  The third major split was more evenly divided, between the Italian branch, which comprises many languages spoken in the [[Italian Peninsula]], and the Gallo-Iberian branch.

===Another proposal===
However, this is not the only view. Another common classification begins by splitting the Romance languages into two main branches, East and West. The East group includes Romanian, the languages of [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]], and all [[languages of Italy]] south of a line through the cities of [[Rimini]] and [[La Spezia]] (see ''[[La Spezia–Rimini Line]]''). Languages in this group are said to be more conservative, i.e. they retained more features of the original Latin.

The latter then split into a [[Gallo-Romance]] group, which became the [[Langues d'oïl|Oïl languages]] (including French), [[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italian]], Occitan, [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]] and [[Romansh language|Romansh]], and an [[Iberian Romance Languages|Iberian Romance]] group which became Spanish and Portuguese.

===The wave hypothesis===
Linguists like Jean-Pierre Chambon claim that the various regional languages did not evolve in isolation from their neighbours; on the contrary, they see many changes propagating from the more central regions (Italy and France) towards the periphery (Iberian Peninsula and Romania).&lt;ref&gt;[[#kf|Kalyan &amp; François (2018)]].&lt;/ref&gt; These authors see the Romance family as a [[Linkage (linguistics)|linkage]] rather than a tree-like family, and insist that the [[Wave model]] is better suited than the [[Tree model]] for representing the history of Romance.

==Degree of separation from Latin==
In a study by linguist [[Mario Pei]] (1949), the degrees of [[Language modernisation|evolution]] of the Romance languages with respect to the ancestral Latin were found to be as follows&lt;ref&gt;See [[#baati|''Italica'' 1950: 46]] (cf. [https://books.google.com/books?id=M0sbAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Demonstrates+a+comparative+statistical+method%22] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=M0sbAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22there+is+a+maximum+of+77+change+points%22]): "Pei, Mario A. "A New Methodology for Romance Classification." Word, v, 2 (Aug. 1949), 135–146. Demonstrates a comparative statistical method for determining the extent of change from the Latin for the free and checked accented vowels of French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Rumanian, Old Provençal, and Logudorese Sardinian. By assigning 3½ change points per vowel (with 2 points for diphthongization, 1 point for modification in vowel quantity, ½ point for changes due to nasalization, palatalization or umlaut, and −½ point for failure to effect a normal change), there is a maximum of 77 change points for free and checked stressed vowel sounds (11×2×3½=77). According to this system (illustrated by seven charts at the end of the article), the percentage of change is greatest in French (44%) and least in Italian (12%) and Sardinian (8%). Prof. Pei suggests that this statistical method be extended not only to all other phonological, but also to all morphological and syntactical, phenomena.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[#koutna|Koutna ''et al.'' (1990: 294)]]:  "In the late forties and in the fifties some new proposals for classification of the Romance languages appeared. A statistical method attempting to evaluate the evidence quantitatively was developed in order to provide not only a classification, but at the same time a measure of the divergence among the languages. The earliest attempt was made in 1949 by Mario Pei (1901–1978), who measured the divergence of seven modern Romance languages from Classical Latin, taking as his criterion the evolution of stressed vowels. Pei's results do not show the degree of contemporary divergence among the languages from each other but only the divergence of each one from Classical Latin. The closest language turned out to be Sardinian with 8% of change. Then followed Italian — 12%; Spanish — 20%; Romanian — 23,5%; Provençal — 25%; Portuguese — 31%; French — 44%."&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]: 8%;
*[[Italian language|Italian]]: 12%;
*[[Spanish language|Spanish]]: 20%;
*[[Romanian language|Romanian]]: 23.5%;
*[[Occitan language|Occitan]]: 25%;
*[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: 31%;
*[[French language|French]]: 44%.

'''Ecological land classification''' is a cartographical delineation or [[regionalisation]] of distinct [[ecology|ecological]] areas, identified by their [[geology]], [[topography]], [[soil]]s, [[vegetation]], [[climate]] conditions, living species, [[habitat]]s, water resources, and sometimes also [[wikt:anthropic|anthropic]] factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kellogg|first=Charles|title=A Method for the Classification of Rural Lands for Assessment in Western North Dakota|journal=The Journal of Land &amp; Public Utility Economics|date=February 1933|volume=9|issue=1|page=12|jstor=3138756}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors control and influence biotic composition and ecological processes.

==Concept==
The expression "ecological land classification" as understood in this article, is approximate with the biogeographical and ecological regionalisations in a scientific context (see [[biogeography#biogeographic units|biogeographic units]]).

However, its actual usage is more approximate with a tool used for [[land management]], in the context of [[environmental resource management]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, M.R. 1981. ''Ecological land classification terrestrial subsystem: a basic inventory system for planning and management on the Mark Twain National Forest''. USDA Forest Service, Eastern Region. 56 pp., [https://books.google.com/books?id=AOGkpcqyS44C].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, J. C., Bestelmeyer, B. T., McClaran, M. P., Robinett, D., Briske, D. D., Wu, X. B., &amp; Fernández-Giménez, M. E. (2016). Can ecological land classification increase the utility of vegetation monitoring data?. ''Ecological Indicators'' 69: 657-666.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada ecological land classification schemes are commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;Wicken, E. B. 1986. ''Terrestrial ecozones of Canada. Environment Canada''. Ecological Land Classification Series No. 19. Lands Directorate, Ottawa. 26 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Provincial authorities have adopted methods to classify [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] within various ecoregions of the province. Ontario is one such province that uses an extensive method to define [[ecological unit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LUEPS/Publication/264779.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements in hand held technology have allowed for more efficient collection of vegetation and physiological data in the field, such as with the ELC eTool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecosim.ca/ELCWebApp/ecological_land_classification/ELC_eTool.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification types==
Many different lists and ecological land classification schemes have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Part of the list proposed below is inspired by [[Miklos Udvardy]] ''classification of the Biographical Provinces in the World'' which was prepared by Unesco's Man and the Biosphere program, published in 1975 and updated in 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Udvardy, M. D. F. (1975). ''A classification of the biogeographical provinces of the world''. IUCN Occasional Paper no. 18. Morges, Switzerland: IUCN, [http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/udvardy.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcap-sk.org/docs/6_skecositeguide/Ecoregions_and_Ecosites.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Biogeography]] - Biogeographical provinces take into account both flora and fauna.
*[[Phytogeography]] - from Greek words phyto = [[plant]] and [[geography]] meaning also distribution, concerned with the geographic distribution of [[plant species]].
*[[Botany]] - botanists have identified [[floristic province]]s based on [[flora]]-[[plant community|plant communities]]
*[[Zoology]] - zoologists have identified zoogeographic provinces based on [[fauna]]l communities.
*[[Conservation ethic|Conservation]] - approximating ecosystem capacity and potentials.
*[[Geology]] and [[Pedology (soil study)]] - the physical matter and energy that constitute the Earth.

=== Approaches to classifications===

American geographer [[Robert Bailey (geographer)|Robert Bailey]] defines a hierarchy of ecosystem units ranging from micro-ecosystems (individual homogeneous sites, in the order of {{convert|10|km2|0}} in area), through meso-ecosystems ([[landscape ecology|landscape mosaics]], in the order of {{convert|1000|km2|-2}}) to macro-ecosystems ([[ecoregions]], in the order of {{convert|100000|km2|-4}}).&lt;ref name="BaileyCh2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ecosystem Geography|last=Bailey|first=Robert G.|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-0-387-89515-4|edition=Second|location=New York|pages=25-28|chapter=Chapter 2}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey outlined five different methods for identifying ecosystems: ''[[Holism|gestalt]]'' ("a whole that is not derived through considerable of its parts"), in which regions are recognized and boundaries drawn intuitively; a map overlay system where different layers like [[geology]], [[landform]]s and soil types are overlain to identify ecosystems; [[Cluster analysis|multivariate clustering]] of site attributes; [[digital image processing]] of [[remote sensing|remotely sensed]] data grouping areas based on their appearance or other [[Multispectral image|spectral]] properties; or by a "controlling factors method" where a subset of factors (like soils, climate, vegetation [[physiognomy]] or the [[species distribution|distribution]] of plant or animal species) are selected from a large array of possible ones are used to delineate ecosystems.&lt;ref name="BaileyCh3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ecosystem Geography|last=Bailey|first=Robert G.|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-0-387-89515-4|edition=Second|location=New York|pages=29–40|chapter=Chapter 3}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast with Bailey's methodology, Puerto Rico ecologist [[Ariel Lugo]] and coauthors identified ten characteristics of an effective classification system. For example that it be based on [[georeference]]d, quantitative data; that it should minimize subjectivity and explicitly identify criteria and assumptions; that it should be structured around the factors that drive ecosystem processes; that it should reflect the hierarchical nature of ecosystems; that it should be flexible enough to conform to the various scales at which ecosystem management operates.&lt;ref name="Lugo1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lugo|first=A.

'''''Emigre''''' ({{ISSN|1045-3717}}) was a graphic design magazine published by [[Emigre (type foundry)|Emigre Graphics]] between 1984 and 2005; it was first published in 1984 in [[San Francisco, California]], United States. Art-directed by [[Rudy VanderLans]] using fonts designed by his wife, [[Zuzana Licko]], ''Emigre'' was one of the first publications to use [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers and had a large influence on graphic designers moving into [[desktop publishing]] (DTP). Its variety of layouts, use of guest designers, and opinionated articles also had an effect on other design publications.

The focus of ''Emigre'' was both redundant and wandering — both positive qualities as a journal produced by a tight and evolving group of designers and writers with Vanderlans at the center. Vanderlans was typically editor, though guest-editors also appeared ([[Gail Swanlund]], Anne Burdick, Andrew Blauvelt) and the work/writing of Zuzana Licko and [[Jeffery Keedy]] reappeared throughout the magazine's history.

The magazine began in 1984 with a focus on the [[émigré]]. The first eight issues were concerned with boundaries, international culture, travel accounts and alienation (as the issues' titles suggest). The first eight issues also incorporated a dynamic aesthetic that caught the attention of designers and led to the next stage in the magazine's evolution.

Beginning with Issue 9 — devoted to the art of [[Vaughan Oliver]] at [[4AD]] — the magazine explored design in itself, devoting issues to [[Cranbrook Educational Community|Cranbrook]], the [[Macintosh]], type design and individual graphic designers. In two issues in 1992 and 1993, the magazine chronicled the work of [[David Carson (graphic designer)|David Carson]] and [[Ray Gun (magazine)|Raygun]].

Increasingly, ''Emigre'' became a platform for essays and writings on design. This aspect of ''Emigre'' came to the forefront with issues in 1994 and the magazine changed its format in 1995 from its oversized layout to a text-friendlier format that debuted with Issue 33. The magazine retained this character through Issue 59 in 2001.

Emigre then took a sharp turn with four re-formatted issues in 2001 and 2002 that included one DVD ("Catfish," an experimental documentary film on the work of designer and performance artist Elliott Earls) and three compact discs (featuring the music of [[Honey Barbara]], [[The Grassy Knoll (band)|The Grassy Knoll]] and Scenic.

In its fifth and final incarnation, the last six issues of ''Emigre'' were co-published by [[Princeton Architectural Press]] as small softcover books. The last issue, The End, was published in 2005.

==Formats==
The magazine changed formats several times: it was originally published quarterly in a large format where each page measures 285&amp;nbsp;mm x 425&amp;nbsp;mm (slightly shorter than 11" x 17" or US ledger/tabloid size); starting with issue 33, each page was about 8.5" x 11" (US letter size); it changed into a multimedia format (a booklet where each page was 133&amp;nbsp;mm x 210&amp;nbsp;mm, plus a [[CD]] or [[DVD]]) starting with issue 60; and finally, starting with issue 64, the magazine became a book format, published semi-annually, where each page measured 133&amp;nbsp;mm x 210&amp;nbsp;mm. The issues in the book format were co-published by [[Princeton Architectural Press]].

'''Euskaltzaindia''' (literally, "group of keepers of the Basque language"; often translated '''Royal Academy of the Basque Language''') is the official academic [[Language planning|language regulatory institution]] which watches over the [[Basque language]]. It carries out research on the [[language]], seeks to protect it, and establishes standards of use. It is known in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as '''La Real Academia de la Lengua Vasca''' (being under the royal patronage of the [[Spanish monarchy]], like the [[Real Academia Española]]) and in [[French language|French]] as '''Académie de la Langue Basque'''.

The academy was given status of a royal academy in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1976-6397&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
The Euskaltzaindia was established within the context of the [[Basque Renaissance]] (''Eusko Pizkundea'', 1876–1936) in the framework provided by the Congress of Basque Studies held in [[Oñati]] in 1918, at a time when the Basque language was being proclaimed as a central cultural value to be protected and promoted&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/895115828|title=Das zweigeteilte Baskenland : sprachkontakt, sprachvariation und regionale identität in Frankreich und Spanien|last=Claudia,|first=Schlaak,|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=9783110372397|location=Berlin|pages=51|oclc=895115828}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Important figures from the 19th century had already demanded the setting-up of an [[academy]] in defence of the language (Ulibarri, 1832; Aizkibel, 1856; d'Abbadie and Duvoisin, 1862; [[Jose Manterola]], 1880 and Artiñano, 1886), and it was during the first two decades of the 20th century when various entities – some scientific and others more popular ones – also emphasized the need for its immediate creation. The scientific contributions of major foreign figures ([[Louis Lucien Bonaparte]], Van Eys, [[Hugo Schuchardt]], Dodgson, Gavel etc.) and from within the country ([[Arturo Campión]], [[Resurrección María de Azkue|Azkue]], Urquijo etc.), as well as the express demand on the part of Basque language loyalist organisations (for example, ''Eusko Esnalea'') created a favourable climate for the public authorities to take on the task of setting up the academy.

The first initiative in this direction came from the provincial [[government]] of [[Biscay]], which the other three provincial governments in the [[Iberian Peninsula|peninsular]] part of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] subsequently joined (1918), with articles of association being approved and Euskaltzaindia being legally constituted in October 1919. One year later its journal ''Euskera'' was launched, the official organ for the publication of its rules and research work, which has survived to the present day.

The current internal structure and organisation can be summarised as follows: the academy is governed by a ruling body composed of the [[Chairman]], Deputy Chairman, [[Secretary]] and [[Treasurer]]. The heads of the Research and Watchdog Sections are also members. Plenary sessions must be held at least once a month. Under current rules the Academy has 24 full members and an unlimited number of associate members. The Academy is present throughout the area where Basque is used, with a head office in [[Bilbao]] and regional offices in [[Bayonne]] (Baiona), [[Donostia|Donostia-San Sebastián]], [[Pamplona|Iruñea-Pamplona]] and [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]].

== Goals ==
The Academy's articles of association set out the institution's objectives, first published in 1920. Those articles have been repeatedly reformed (and standing orders added) with the aim of adapting the institution to the [[Natural language|linguistic]] and [[cultural]] circumstances of the day. However, the initial articles defining ''Euskaltzaindia'''s ultimate goals have simply been ratified over the years, with new details being added where necessary (e.g. article 1 in 1976). The aims of the Academy were set out as follows in the original articles:

Art. 1 – The aim of this institution is to watch over the Basque language, paying close attention to its promotion, both philologically and socially.

Art. 2 – Accordingly, the Academy deals with both these areas in their respective sections: the Research Section and the Tutelary Section, with members belonging to both.

It is thus clear that the work of Euskaltzaindia is concerned with both the [[text corpus|corpus]] and the status of the language. Since then the Academy has maintained these two sections in order to carry out its mission.

== History ==
In the decade and a half prior to the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1919–1936), the Academy managed to consolidate itself as an institution and set about its project of promoting the birth of a standard [[literary language]], although it was unable to provide a precise, solid [[academic]] formulation for that aim. On the other hand, its work in that period contributed decisively to a better understanding of the language through  [[Resurrección María de Azkue]]'s studies (''Morfología Vasca'', 1923–1934) and far reaching surveys among speakers of the [[language]] (''Erizkizundi Irukoitza'', from 1922 onwards). The journal "Euskera" is a faithful witness to the work carried out at the time.

In 1936 and the years which followed, under the [[language politics of Francoist Spain]] the Academy's previous activities were reduced to silence until [[Resurrección María de Azkue|Azkue]], with the collaboration of [[Federico Krutwig]], was able to timidly{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} reinitiate academic life at the beginning of the 1950s. The articles of association were reformed in 1954, new full members were elected and from 1956 on the Academy started to enjoy a more settled existence both in its internal affairs and in its public conferences and open meetings (first postwar congress: [[Arantzazu]], 1956).

The following decade (1956–1968) coincided with a new generation of collaborators{{Clarify|date=September 2009}}, the increasing introduction of Basque in bilingual non-state schools ([[ikastola]]k), the revival of the Basque language press and the first attempts at teaching basic [[literacy]] in Basque, among other initiatives.

== ''Euskera Batúa '', unified Basque ==
The Euskaltzaindia has been a vocal and active advocate of the introduction of a unified [[dialect]] of the Basque language, known as "[[Batua|Euskera Batúa]]", or Unified Basque. Basque has been usually divided into 8 different dialects, varying in their level of mutual intelligibility. The first detailed dialectical analysis was by [[Louis Lucien Bonaparte]]. However, many people have seen this as a weakness in the language's fight for survival in a world in which minority languages spoken in states are wiped out by the states' official language. Having been for centuries pressured on both sides by [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]], and under the rule of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] coming close to extinction, the Academy felt the need to create a unified dialect of Basque, in order that the language have a greater chance of survival. Unified of Basque was heavily based on the [[Gipuzkoan]] dialect – the dialect with the richest [[literary]] heritage.

The 1968 [[Arantzazu Congress]] laid down the basic guidelines for achieving that objective in a systematic way (lexicon, morphology, declension and spelling). A further step was taken in 1973 with a proposal to establish a standard conjugation.

The debate arising from this new set of standard language rules (1968–1976) did not prevent it from becoming increasingly accepted in teaching, the media, and administration (1976–1983), within the context of burgeoning regional government (Statute of Autonomy in [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Euskadi]], 1979; Improvement of the Charter of [[Navarre]], 1982). Many people, however, continue to oppose the imposition of a single created dialect of Basque.

''Euskaltzaindia'' counsels the Basque administrations wishing to officialize Basque place names.
It is funded by the [[Biscay|Biscayne]], [[Gipuzkoa|Gipuzkoan]], [[Alava|Alavese]], [[Navarre|Navarrese]], [[Culture of Spain|Spanish]], and [[Culture of France|French]] authorities for culture.

[[File:Thomas Rowlandson (35).jpg|thumb|Artist [[Thomas Rowlandson|Thomas Rowlandson's]], [[hetaera]]s in the [[harem]]]]
A '''gang bang''' is a situation in which several people engage in physical [[sexual activity]] with one specific individual sequentially or at the same time.&lt;ref name=Partridge&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English]]|pages=327, 995|isbn=0415212588|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; That specific individual is the central focus of the sexual activity;&lt;ref name=Partridge/&gt; for example, it could be one woman surrounded by several men or a man with multiple women. Rather than serial couplings by two people, the gang bang is defined by the number and simultaneity of the various sex acts, such as [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal]], [[Anal sex|anal]] or [[Oral sex|oral]] sex or [[Double penetration#Multiple penetration|double penetration]] or triple penetration.

==Practice==
The largest gang bangs are sponsored by [[pornographic]] film companies, and [[Gang bang pornography|recorded]], but a gang bang is not unusual in the [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinger]] community. It is more often considered to have multiple men and one woman, while a so-called "reverse gang-bang" (one man and many women),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Swingland: Between the Sheets of the Secretive, Sometimes Messy, but Always Adventurous Swinging Lifestyle|page=296|isbn=1476732531|year=2013|author=Daniel Stern}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be seen in pornography, is rare in real life.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Male-on-male gangbangs also happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=86|title=Gay-2-Zee: A Dictionary of Sex, Subtext, and the Sublime|author=Donald F. Reuter|isbn=0312354274|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gang bangs are not defined by the precise number of participants, but usually involve more than three people and may involve a dozen or more. When the gang bang is organized specifically to culminate with the (near) simultaneous or rapid serial ejaculations of all male participants on the central man or woman, then it may be referred to by the Japanese term ''[[Bukkake (sex act)|bukkake]].&lt;ref name=Partridge/&gt;

By contrast, three people engaged in sex is normally referred to as a ''[[threesome]]'', and four people are normally referred to as a ''[[Foursome (group sex)|foursome]].'' Gang bangs also differ from [[group sex]], such as threesomes and foursomes, in that most (if not all) sexual acts during a gang bang are centered on or performed with just the central person. Although the participants of a gang bang may know each other, the spontaneity and anonymity of participants is often part of the attraction. Additionally, the other participants normally do not engage in sex acts with each other, but may stand nearby and masturbate while waiting for an opportunity to engage in sexual activity.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Pornography==
Though there have been numerous gang bang [[pornographic film]]s since the 1980s, they usually involved no more than half a dozen to a dozen men. However, starting with ''[[World's Biggest Gang Bang|The World's Biggest Gangbang]]'' (1995) starring [[Annabel Chong]], the [[pornographic]] industry began producing a series of films ostensibly setting gangbang records for most consecutive sex acts by one person in a short period.&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;[http://archive.salon.com/health/sex/urge/1999/08/31/houston "The gang's all here (Hope flickers at the World's Biggest Gangbang)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011064309/http://archive.salon.com/health/sex/urge/1999/08/31/houston/ |date=2009-10-11 }}, Kevin Bisch, ''[[Salon Magazine]]'', August 31, 1999, Retrieved June 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

These kinds of films were financially successful, winning [[AVN Awards]] for the best selling pornographic films of their year; however, the events were effectively unofficiated and the record-breaking claims often misleading.&lt;ref name=VillageVoice&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/people/0003,taormino,11859,24.html "The ABCs of Porn"], [[Tristan Taormino]], ''[[The Village Voice]]'', January 19–25, 2000, Retrieved June 22, 2007{{Dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jasmin St. Claire]] described her "record", purportedly set with 300 men in ''World's Biggest Gang Bang 2'', as "among the biggest cons ever pulled off in the porn business", with merely about 30 men "strategically placed and filmed," only ten of whom were actually able to perform sexually on camera.&lt;ref&gt;''"What The Hell Was I Thinking?!!" - Confessions of the World's Most Controversial Sex Symbol'', Jasmin St. Claire &amp; Jake Brown, BearManor Media, 2010, P. 131–32&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5105">A '''gender neutral title''' is an honorific title that does not indicate the gender of the person being formally addressed, such as in a letter or other communication, or when introducing the person to others. By comparison, the traditional honorifics of Miss, Mrs, Ms and Mr all indicate the [[gender binary|binary gender]] of the individual.

The newer term "Mx" avoids specifying gender not only for persons who wish not to indicate a binary gender (male or female) but also for persons whose [[gender identity]] does not fit the [[gender binary]]. Honorifics are used in situations when it is inappropriate to refer to someone only by their first or last name, such as when addressing a letter "Dear Mx Jones" or when introducing the person to others. Activists, supporters and others are working toward awareness and acceptance of alternative honorifics including Mx.

Note that in Britain, honorifics are not ended with a period, while in the [[United States]] a period is used with the honorifics "Mr." and "Mrs." because they are abbreviations (for master and mistress), as well as with "Ms." in order to preserve the form.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2011/11/what-are-mrs-and-ms-short-for/&lt;/ref&gt; "Miss" is not ended with a period because it is not an abbreviated form of a longer word. In Britain the periods are not included since where the period is placed there are no letters elided from the word.

==Gender neutral titles==
===Mx===
{{See also|Mx (title)}}
'''Mx''' is a title commonly used by [[genderqueer|non-binary people]] as well as those who do not identify with the gender binary,&lt;ref name="Beyond the Binary: Question 23"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnlester.wordpress.com/2013/07/08/beyond-the-binary-question-twenty-three/|accessdate=8 November 2014|title=Beyond the Binary: Question Twenty-Three}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was first written about in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="SundayTimesDict"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article1551885.ece|title=Now pick Mr, Mrs, Miss, Ms . . . or Mx for no specific gender|date=3 May 2015|publisher=The Sunday Times|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/11597192/Whats-it-like-to-be-a-Mx.html |title= What’s it like to be a Mx? |author= Olivia Goldhill |work= The Telegraph |date= 11 May 2015 |accessdate= 1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nat Titman]] spoke about its usage and brought it into popular acceptance.&lt;ref name="mxcreation"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Among all other gender neutral titles, Mx is the most commonly used one,&lt;ref name="NBGQsurvey2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=NB/GQ Survey 2016 - the worldwide results|url=http://gendercensus.tumblr.com/post/164635292070/the-big-pronouns-survey-results|website=Nonbinary Stats|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is accepted by government and other organisations throughout the UK.&lt;ref&gt;http://uktrans.info/attachments/article/249/mxevidencelowres.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The "x" is intended to stand as a wildcard character, and does not imply a "mixed" gender.&lt;ref name="mxcreation"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://practicalandrogyny.com/2014/08/28/when-was-the-mx-gender-inclusive-title-created/ |title= When was the Mx gender-inclusive title created? |author= Nat Titman |work= Practical Androgyny |date= 28 August 2014 |accessdate= 4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mx" is usually pronounced "mix" or with a schwa, "məx".&lt;ref name="mxpronunciation"&gt;{{cite web|title=On the pronunciation of Mx|url=http://nonbinarystats.tumblr.com/post/143382802540/on-the-pronunciation-of-mx|website=Nonbinary Stats|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misc===

'''Misc''' or sometimes 'misk' is another gender title pronoun.&lt;ref name="Beyond the Binary: Question 23" /&gt; The word is derived from the Latin word '''miscellus''', meaning “mixed,” following the rationale that a lot of non-binary people would say that they have aspects of various genders at various times.

In a 2016 international survey of non-binary participants, 0.8% of over 3,000 participants preferred the title Misc.&lt;ref name="NBGQsurvey2016"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ind.===
'''Ind''', which stands for Individual, is a newly created gender neutral title. This title may be more appropriate for those who do not feel Mx meets their gender neutral standards, as Mx can sometimes be taken to stand for "mix". Ind was created to be free of gender, entirely, thus making it a better option for [[Genderqueer|agender]] and gender nonconforming persons.

In a survey of over 3,000 nonbinary people in 2016, around 2.5% of nonbinary people used the title Ind.&lt;ref name="NBGQsurvey2016"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional titles==
There are a number of titles, such as [[Doctor (title)|Dr]] and [[Professor]], that are used regardless of gender by those qualified to use them. However, those professional titles being a legacy of the noninclusive past, [[Doctor (title)|Dx]] has been proposed as a title for doctors to denote a non-binary gender identity.{{who?|date=November 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4948">'''Hjalmar Steenstrup''' (11 October 1890 – 18 December 1945) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] insurance agent, and [[Milorg]] pioneer and intelligence agent during [[World War II]].

==Personal life==
Steenstrup was born in [[Modum]] as a son of curate Hjalmar Steenstrup (1847–1915) and his wife Fredrikke Brun (1861–1905). He was a descendant of [[Paul Steenstrup]] and [[Peter Steenstrup]], and a nephew of [[Johan Brun]] and brother-in-law of [[Gunnar Isachsen]]. He married Eva Glatved Martens (1896–1976) in August 1916 in [[Alversund]].&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Hjalmar Steenstrup |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Inger |last=Døving |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Hjalmar_Steenstrup/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son also bore the same name. He chose a career in agriculture, policing and soldiering within the Norwegian branch of SS.

==Career==
Steenstrup worked for and later managed the insurance company ''Det norske gjensidige Skogbrandforsikringsselskab''. He was co-founder and manager of the insurance association [[Samtrygd|Samtrygd Gjensidig Norsk Forsikringsforening]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He issued the book ''[[Hvem er hvem?]]'' (lit. "Who is Who?") for 1930, 1934 and 1938, and wrote journal articles on insurance matters as well as on language politics.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Hjalmar Steenstrup |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=|location=|url=http://www.snl.no/Hjalmar_Steenstrup |editor=|language=Norwegian|accessdate=14 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been a co-founder of [[Riksmålsvernet]] in 1919.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

==World War II==
During the [[German occupation of Norway]], Steenstrup was a central courier travelling between Norway and [[Sweden]]. He carried money from Government representative [[Anders Frihagen]] at the [[Norwegian legation in Stockholm]] to the underground movement in Norway. He was in contact with the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Special Operations Executive]] in [[Stockholm]] already in the Summer 1940, and in contact with [[Malcolm Munthe]] at the British legation in Stockholm. He was given the task of finding a suitable military leader to coordinate the emerging military resistance in Norway, which resulted in the recruitment of [[Ole Berg]]. Under the cover name "Cato" he coordinated [[Milorg]]'s transport of refugees from Norway to Sweden, and was also involved in intelligence.&lt;ref name=kl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Moland |first=Arnfinn |authorlink=Arnfinn Moland |encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]] |title=Steenstrup, Hjalmar |url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/s/s7.html#steenstrup-hjalmar |accessdate=19 December 2009 |language=Norwegian |editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit Nøkleby|Nøkleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[Øystein Sørensen|Sørensen]] |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo |isbn=82-02-14138-9 |page=397 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105214830/http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/s/s7.html#steenstrup-hjalmar |archivedate=5 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested in July 1941, and held at the prison [[Møllergata 19]] until September 1943.

By 1945, he could bring collected material on the fate of many prisoners to Sweden. He continued the registration work for the Norwegian Legation in Stockholm, and later for the Government in Oslo.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He was selected to represent the Norwegian concentration camp prisoners during the [[Nuremberg Trials]].&lt;ref name=kl/&gt; He participated at preparations for the Nuremberg Trials in Germany in December 1945.

The '''Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer''' is the [[Hugo Award]] given each year for writers of works related to science fiction or fantasy which appeared in low- or non-paying publications such as [[semiprozine]]s or [[fanzine]]s or in generally available electronic media during the previous calendar year. There is no restriction that the writer is not also a professional author, and several such authors have won the award for their non-paying works. The award was first presented in 1967 and has been awarded annually.

During the 58 regular and retro nomination years, 98 writers have been nominated; 21 of these have won, including ties. [[David Langford]] has received the largest number of awards, with 21 wins out of 31 nominations. He was nominated every year from 1979 through 2009, and won 19 times in a row from 1989 through 2007. The other writers to win more than once are [[Richard E. Geis]], with seven wins out of sixteen nominations; [[Mike Glyer]], with four wins out of twenty-five nominations; [[Susan Wood (science fiction)|Susan Wood Glicksohn]], with three of eight; [[Harry Warner, Jr.]], with two out of eight; [[Wilson Tucker]], with two out of seven; [[Bob Shaw]], who won both times he was nominated; [[Forrest J Ackerman]], with two out of four Retro Hugos; and [[Ray Bradbury]], who won both Retro Hugos he was nominated for. The writers with the most nominations without winning are [[Evelyn C. Leeper]], who was nominated twelve times in a row from 1990 through 2001, and [[Steven H Silver]], whose twelve nominations span 2000-2013.

==History==
The Hugo Awards are presented every year by the World Science Fiction Society for the best [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] works and achievements of the previous year. The award is named after [[Hugo Gernsback]], the founder of the pioneering science fiction magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', and was once officially known as the Science Fiction Achievement Award.&lt;ref name="LocusHugoinfo"/&gt; The award has been described as "a fine showcase for speculative fiction" and "the best known literary award for science fiction writing".&lt;ref name="GuardianHugo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LitroHugo"/&gt; In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or "Retro Hugos", have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt; To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1946, 1951, and 1954, and the fan writer award has been given each time.&lt;ref name="LocusRetroHugoinfo"/&gt;

{{quote|Fan writing is a peculiar entity, generally having little in common with professional fiction writing. Fan writing can be somber or witty (and even humorous, though that is rarer), expository or abstruse; it can make the momentous commonplace and the trivial momentous, according to the desire of the writer. Commonly, fan ''writing'' is a reflection of ''being'' a fan (as opposed to the many people who simply read science fiction) in a world mostly populated with people who aren't.|Hitchcock, Chip|Introduction, ''In and Out of Quandry'', 1982&lt;ref name="quote"/&gt;}}

Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]], or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as [[instant-runoff voting]] with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt; Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.&lt;ref name="thaabout"/&gt; Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations.&lt;ref name="2017change"/&gt; Worldcons are generally held near [[Labor Day]], and in a different city around the world each year.&lt;ref name="LocusHugoinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="worldcon"/&gt;

== Winners and nominees ==

=== Retro Hugos ===
Beginning with the [[54th World Science Fiction Convention|1996 Worldcon]], the World Science Fiction Society created the concept of "Retro Hugos", in which the Hugo award could be retroactively awarded for 50, 75, or 100 years prior. Retro Hugos may only be awarded for years in which a Worldcon was hosted, but no awards were originally given.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt; Retro Hugos have been awarded six times, for 1939, 1941, 1943, 1946, 1951, and 1954. The 1939, 1941, and 1943 awards were given 75 years later; the other three awards were given 50 years later.&lt;ref name="LocusRetroHugoinfo"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2485">In mathematics, the '''Kneser–Tits problem''', introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Tits|authorlink=Jacques Tits|year=1964}} based on a suggestion by [[Martin Kneser]], asks whether the Whitehead group ''W''(''G'',''K'') of a semisimple  simply connected isotropic [[algebraic group]] ''G'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' is trivial. The Whitehead group is the quotient of the [[rational point]]s of ''G'' by the [[normal subgroup]] generated by ''K''-subgroups isomorphic to the additive group.

==Fields for which the Whitehead group vanishes==

A special case of the Kneser–Tits problem asks for which fields the Whitehead group of a semisimple almost simple  simply connected [[linear algebraic group|isotropic algebraic group]] is always trivial.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9271">{{about|the Persian variety historically spoken in Kuwait|Kuwaiti people of Persian origins|Ayam (ethnicity)}}
'''Kuwaiti Persian''', known in Kuwait as ʿīmi and spelled Eimi in some works&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Written in Arabic alphabet as "عيمي", and pronounced {{IPA|/ʕi:mi/}} in Kuwaiti Arabic and {{IPA|/[ʔ]i:mi:/}} in Kuwaiti Persian. Sometimes it is also referred to as ايراني "Iranian", but this could refer to the [[Persian language|Persian]] language as well.)&lt;/ref&gt; is a dying (endangered) combination of different varieties of the [[Persian language]] and [[Achomi language]] that has been spoken in [[Kuwait]] for more than two centuries. Persian was spoken since the foundation of Kuwait, especially in the [[Sharg (Kuwait)|Sharg]] district of the historical [[Kuwait City]], where families that emigrated from [[Persia]] had settled.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1040&amp;context=history_theses page 62&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kuwaitis of Iranian ancestry are called [['Ajam of Kuwait|Ayam]] ({{IPA|ʕɐjɐm}}). After conducting research about the usage of Persian language in Kuwait in 2004, Abdulmuhsen Dashti, a professor at [[Kuwait University]], projects that the Persian language will disappear in Ayam families within two generations.&lt;ref&gt;Language Maintenance or Shift? An Ethnographic Investigation of the Use of Farsi among Kuwaiti Ajams: A Case Study. AbdulMohsen Dashti. Arab Journal for the Humanities. Volume 22 Issue : 87. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{see also|'Ajam of Kuwait}}
Kuwait is a country with no indigenous population. Starting in the eighteenth century, many people started emigrating to Kuwait seeking better life and escaping persecution. The immigration happened mainly (but not only) from territories geographically close to Kuwait, including [[Eastern Province (Saudi Arabia)|Eastern Province]] of the nowadays [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Nejd]], Persia (nowadays called [[Iran]]) and [[Iraq]]. Immigrants from Persia were the basis of [[multilingualism]] in Kuwait, since they brought with them a completely different and distinct language than Arabic. It is projected that more than 30% of Kuwaiti citizens are [[Ayam (people)|Ayam]]. 

Most Ayam resided in the [[Sharg (Kuwait)|Sharg]] historical district in the old [[Kuwait City]], thus forming a [[linguistic enclave]] that preserved the language for generations until the discovery of [[oil]]. They communicated in Persian between each other, and did not mingle a lot with Arabic speakers who resided in other districts of Kuwait City until after the industrialisation of Kuwait and Kuwait City that scattered people who lived in the districts of Kuwait City to the suburbs. The linguistic enclave wasn't there any longer and Ayam had to learn Kuwaiti Arabic to survive in the new environment.

The Persian emigrants spoke a variety of dialects and sub-dialects. This mixture came to be called 'imi ([language] of the Ayam in Arabic and Persian), over generations, the variety of Persian spoken today by Ayam developed. As all Ayam acquired Kuwaiti Arabic by time, Kuwaiti Persian is expected to be gone within no more than two generations. Ayam people who still speak Persian are bilingual in both Kuwait Arabic and Persian, while most young Ayam nowadays are native speakers of Kuwaiti Arabic only.

== Linguistics ==
`imi has no [[official language|official status]] and it is not standardised. As a Koine, `imi is often seen as a "childish" patois by the public.

Below is a table the compares some words in Kuwaiti and Standard Persian, as collected by Batoul Hasan. Some changes seen in Kuwaiti Persian are also common in other non-standard Persian dialects in Iran as well.

== Attitudes ==
The anti-[[language preservation|preservation]] attitude of the Kuwaiti government towards the Persian language led and will eventually lead to the disappearance of the language in the Kuwaiti society, as Abdulmuhsen Dashti projects. The government tried and tries to delegitimise the use of `imi in as many domains as possible.

{{quotation box|width=40%|Interviewer: Does it disappoint you that 50 years down the line Ajam will
not speak Eimi anymore?&lt;br&gt;
Interviewee: For what? Why? The minority is always'likely to be absorbed by the
majority. It is a historical fact, it is apart of life|author=from an interview with an Ayam conducted by Batoul Hasan}}

Some Ayam reported unwillingness to pass the language to future generations for pragmatic reasons, as it will hurdle integration into the [[dominant culture]]. The minority group may feel pressure to abandon ties that could be interpreted as showing belonging to other countries, in this case [[Iran]], as Persian is synonymous with Iranian for a lot of Kuwaitis, and the Persian language is actually called Iranian (Kuwaiti Arabic: إيراني) in Kuwaiti Arabic. In several interview conducted by PhD student Batoul Hasan, several have shown hesitation to use or learn Persian due to stigmatisation and prejudice. One person said: "We live in an Arab country where Arabic is the main language and Eimi has no place in this society.", "Speaking Eimi is a sensitive issue that could erupt. It would be more acceptable to speak Israeli (Hebrew) in public, but when you speak Farsi due to societies prejudices you are asking for problems". Many thought that Persian has no place and no use in the Kuwaiti society, as Arabic is the language of Kuwait (according to them). Multilingualism was not favourable, in the eyes of people interviewed by Batoul, unless it involved the acquisition of Arabic and English. Some people even believed that the acquisition of Kuwaiti Persian as a first or second language may affect the acquisition of Arabic.

== Persian in Kuwait ==

The Persian language in general has been considered a threat by some Sunni Islamists. In 2012, MP Muhammad Hassan al-Kandari called for a "firm action" against an advertisement for teaching Persian.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alaan.cc/pagedetails.asp?cid=47&amp;nid=108712&lt;/ref&gt;. The Kuwaiti TV series [[Karimo]] received some criticism for showing Kuwaiti actors speaking fluent Persian; with some calling it a dictated enforcement of Iranian culture on the Kuwaiti society.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ0DDDZ0vi8&lt;/ref&gt;

In the educated circle, Persian is seen as a language with high cultural value. According to an Iranian cultural advisor to Kuwait, Khameyar said that a lot of Kuwaitis speak Persian proudly. He also added that many state officials carry conversations in Persian; including non-Ayam Kuwaitis who speak and answer in Persian with embassy officials. Khameyar also expressed his surprise from the reception their Persian language courses had received.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1394/06/30/865357/%D8%B2%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%DA%A9%D9%88%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87%D9%86%DA%AF%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C-%D8%B4%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D9%87-%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%B4%D9%88%D8%AF&lt;/ref&gt;

Persian is taught in many institutes across Kuwait, including academic institutes, such as [[Kuwait University]], diplomatic cultural institutes, such as the Iranian Embassy cultural office, language institutes, such as [[Berlitz Corporation|Berlitz]], and religious institutes, such as Al-Imam Al-Mujtaba [[seminaries]].&lt;ref&gt;https://motaleaatfarhangi.persianblog.ir/J7raon4mbXs1bWJ4XvGK-%D9%88%D8%B6%D8%B9%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%B2%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%DA%A9%D9%88%DB%8C%D8%AA&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mahmud Pasha Angelović''' ({{lang-sr|Махмуд-паша Анђеловић/Mahmud-paša Anđelović}}; {{lang-tr|Veli Mahmud Paşa}}; 1420–1474) was the [[Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire|Grand Vizier]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1456 to 1466 and again from 1472 to 1474, who also wrote Persian and Turkish poems under the pseudonym '''''Adni''''' (the "Eden-like").{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=311}}

Born in Serbia, he was a descendant of the Byzantine [[Angelos|Angelos family]] that had left Thessaly in 1394. As a child, he was abducted by the Ottomans according to the ''[[devşirme]]'' system and raised as a [[Muslim]] in [[Edirne]]. A capable soldier, he was married to a daughter of Sultan [[Mehmed II]]. After distinguishing himself at the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)]], he was raised to the position of Grand Vizier as a reward, succeeding [[Zaganos Pasha]]. Throughout his tenure, he led armies or accompanied Mehmed II on his own campaigns.

==Origin and early life==

After the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of Thessaly in 1394, the ruling [[Angeloi]]&lt;ref&gt;Théoharis Stavrides The Sultan of vezirs: the life and times of the Ottoman Grand ... - Page 311 "Mahmud Pasha's Pseudonym According to all indications, the pseudonym (mahlas) used by Mahmud Pasha when writing poetry was Adni (the Eden-like) and this is indicated by most sources, most particularly Asik Celebi and Sehi Beg, who ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franz Babinger, William C. Hickman -Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time - 1992 Page 476 "With the possible exception of the grand vizier Mahmud Pasha, who under the pseudonym of Adni wrote Persian and Turkish rhymes, the period offers no further poets of above-average quality.34 Among the poets it seems fitting to mention as ..."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philanthropenoi]] family took refuge. The grandchildren of either [[Alexios Angelos Philanthropenos|Alexios]] or [[Manuel Angelos Philanthropenos|Manuel]] were Mahmud Pasha and his brother [[Mihailo Anđelović]]. He may have also been related to the noblemen [[Alessio Span|Alessio]] and [[Peter Spani (League of Lezhë)|Peter Spani]] through [[Alexios III Angelos]], who was possibly their ancestor. &lt;ref name="Stavrides2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stavrides|first=Théoharis|title=The Sultan of vezirs: the life and times of the Ottoman Grand Vezir Mahmud Pasha Angelovic̕ (1453–1474)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ptXG0uA70lAC&amp;pg=PA230|accessdate=20 January 2012|year=2001|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-12106-5|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the contemporary Byzantine sources and Ibn Kemal calls him Serbian, some late Ottoman sources call him Croatian.{{Cref2|b}}

It is estimated that Angelović was born in the early 1420s.{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=77}} Most historians accept that Angelović was born in [[Novo Brdo]] in the [[Serbian Despotate]], and that his father Mihailos was the son of either [[Alexios Angelos Philanthropenos]] or his son/nephew/brother [[Manuel Angelos Philanthropenos|Manuel]], rulers of [[Thessaly]].{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|pp=73–74, 76–77}} [[T. Stavrides]] views it more probable that Manuel was his grandfather.{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=77}} The only information on his father is that he lived in Serbia in the 1420s.{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=77}} His mother's ancestry is the matter of debate. [[Laonikos Chalkokondyles|Chalkokondyles]] (1430–1470) called her Serbian, [[Kritoboulos]] (1410–1470), Greek, while there are various theories on her noble ancestry.{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|pp=78–93}} Angelović had a brother, [[Mihailo Anđelović]], later a prominent Serbian statesman.{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|pp=93–100}}

According to T. Yazici / ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'', Angelović was "born to a Greek or Serbian family".{{sfn|Yazici|1983|page=470}}

Chalkokondyles mentions that Angelović was captured by Ottoman horsemen while traveling with his mother from Novo Brdo to [[Smederevo]] (the Serbian capital), and taken to the Ottoman court.{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=107}} It is assumed that this took place in 1427, when the Ottomans attacked Serbia.{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=108}} Furthermore, it is unconcluded whether he was captured according to the ''[[devşirme]]'' practice, the regular practice of taking children of conquered noble families, or as a [[prisoner of war]].{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=108–110}} [[Taşköprüzade]] (d. 1560) and [[Aşık Çelebi]] (1520–1572) name two other boys led with Angelović on horseback to Edirne, Molla Iyas and [[Mevlana Abdülkerim]], the latter which reached the rank of ''[[kadıasker]]'' (chief judge) and ''[[şeyhülislam]]'' (Islamic scholar).{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|pp=108–109}} Upon conversion to Islam, he received the name Mahmud.

Little is known about his activities before 1453. According to T. Stavrides, Angelović and his companions were educated in the palace, probably as ''[[içoğlan]]'', and Mahmud then entered service in the [[Enderûn]], later serving prince [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed]], the future sultan.{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=110}} Sources do not agree on which posts he held at the palace.{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=111–112}}

==Life==
Mahmud Pasha was a capable soldier. After distinguishing himself at the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)]], he was raised to the position of Grand Vizier as a reward, succeeding [[Zaganos Pasha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finkel|2006|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his tenure he led armies or accompanied Mehmed II on his own campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Finkel (2006), pp. 78–79, 559, 560&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1458, the Serbian Despot [[Lazar Branković]] died. Mahmud's brother Mihailo became member of a collective regency, but he was soon deposed by the anti-Ottoman and pro-Hungarian faction in the Serbian court. In reaction, Mahmud attacked and seized [[Smederevo Fortress]], although the citadel held out, and seized some additional strongholds in its vicinity. Threatened by a possible Hungarian intervention however he was forced to withdraw south and join the forces of Sultan Mehmed II at [[Skopje]].&lt;ref name="Finkel60"&gt;{{harvnb|Finkel|2006|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1461, he accompanied Mehmed in his campaign against the [[Empire of Trebizond]], the last surviving fragment of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Mahmud negotiated the surrender of the city of [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] with the ''[[protovestiarios]]'', the scholar [[George Amiroutzes]], who was also his cousin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finkel|2006|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1463, Mahmud led the [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina#War with the Bosnian Kingdom|invasion and conquest]] of the Ottoman vassal state of [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]], even though a peace treaty between Bosnia and the Ottomans had just been renewed. He captured the Bosnian king, [[Stephen Tomašević of Bosnia|Stephen Tomašević]], at [[Ključ, Una-Sana Canton|Ključ]], and obtained from him the cession of the country to the Empire.&lt;ref name="Finkel60"/&gt;

Angelović accompanied Mehmed II when he attacked [[Albania Veneta]] in the summer of 1467, and ravaged the lands. For 15 days he pursued [[Skanderbeg]], who was a Venetian ally at the time, but failed to find him, as Skanderbeg retreated into the mountains and then succeeded in fleeing to the coast.{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|pp=163, 164}} According to [[Tursun Beg]] and [[Ibn Kemal]], Angelović swam over [[Bojana (river)|Bojana]], attacked Venetian-controlled [[Shkodër|Scutari]], and plundered the surrounding area.{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=164}}

Mahmud was dismissed in 1468 due to the machinations of his successor, [[Rum Mehmed Pasha]], ostensibly due to irregularities regarding the resettlement of the [[Karamanids]] in [[Constantinople]] following the conquest of Karaman earlier in that year.&lt;ref&gt;Finkel (2006), pp. 78–79&lt;/ref&gt; He was reinstated in 1472, but his relations with the Sultan were now strained. He was dismissed and executed in 1474, allegedly because of Mehmed's son, prince Mustafa. Mahmud had been at loggerheads with Mustafa after divorcing his second wife for spending a night in the same house as Mustafa during Mahmud's absence on campaign in 1473. Mustafa's death later in 1474 was even attributed by later accounts to poisoning by Mahmud.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finkel|2006|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary efforts==
Mahmud Pasha wrote works in [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Turkish language|Turkish]] with "Adni" as his [[nom de plume]].{{sfn|Yazici|1983|page=470}} He composed a ''[[Diwan (poetry)|divan]]'' in Persian composed of 45 ''[[ghazal]]s'' and 21 ''mofrads'', and wrote several "successful ''naziras'' on the ''ghazals'' of [[Zahir-al-Din Faryabi|Zahir Faryabi]] and [[Hafez]]".{{sfn|Yazici|1983|page=470}} Mahmud Pasha also wrote numerous "official letters in Persian".{{sfn|Yazici|1983|page=470}}

==Family==
He married Selçuk Hatun, daughter of [[Zaganos Pasha]], by his wife Sitti Nefise Hatun, and had a son named Ali Bey and a daughter named Hatice Hatun.

'''N.E. Balaram''' &lt;!--Editors: not mistake in spelling last name; read early years--&gt;(Njalile Veettil Edavalathu Balaraman) (20 November 1919 – 16 July 1994) was one of the founding leaders of the [[Communism in Kerala|communist movement]] in [[Kerala]], India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/thiruvananthapuram/article183578.ece N E Balram remembered]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Marxist]] ideologue, scholar in Indian Philosophy and a well known literary critic in [[Malayalam]], he wrote on the history of the communist movement in Kerala, which is considered as the most authentic record of the early period. He also authored several works in history, philosophy, politics, and literature.

==Early life==
Balaram was born on 20 November 1919 in [[Pinarayi]], a village near [[Tellicherry]] Town in the [[Kannur District]] of India. Incidentally, Pinarayi is the birthplace of the [[Communist Party of India]] in kerala, where it held its first meeting in 1939. Young Balaram (His real name was Balaraman, which was somehow shortened to Balaram) was an active member of that landmark conference held in a house near the village library, hardly 200 meters away from his home. He did schooling at a nearby village school. He studied up to 8th standard, which was considered (comparatively) a good school education at that time. After completing school, he became a faculty in a nearby school for a while. By then he was a known scholar in [[Sanskrit]] and Indian philosophy and had a good taste for spirituality which ultimately took him to the Ramkrishna Mission in [[Calcutta]]. There he spent several months learning more about the [[Vedas]], the [[Upanishads]] and other ancient texts. He was dissatisfied with the [[ashram]] activities and returned to Kannur, a discontented young atheist.

Immediately upon return he jumped into political activities as a Congress worker. A [[Socialism|socialist]] group had already been formed in the Congress by that time at the national level and some of the Kerala leaders showed interest in that group. Within a short while Balram too became a member of the Socialist group. In 1938 he attended the 51st session of the [[Indian National Congress]] held in [[Haripura]], [[Gujarat]], where the socialist group came out openly against the policies of the Congress.

==Political Scenario==
Back in Malabar the Congress socialist group started the ground work to build a Communist movement in the state. [[P. Krishna Pillai]], [[K. Damodaran]], [[E. M. S. Namboodiripad]], and N. C. Sekhar were the first team of leaders who took up this cause for which they met unofficially. Then came the historic meeting in Pinarayi, where the entire socialist leadership decided to convert to the Communist Party. The young Balaram was one of the main organizers of this first meeting of the Communist Party of Kerala. The meeting was presided by Com. P. Krishna Pillai, who was elected as the Secretary of the party on that day.
All the senior members of the team were very happy about the meeting and all of them congratulated the organizers and especially the young Balaram for his organizational abilities. Even before the meeting, he had held informal discussions with top leaders like P. Krishna Pillai and theoretician K. Damodaran. They recognized him as a good communist and gave all support. He was actively involved in organizing the party. He was arrested by the police several times and imprisoned for almost six years. He was Secretary of the party in the [[Kottayam Taluk]] in the 1940s.

== Election to State Assembly ==
In 1957, he was elected to the first [[Kerala]] Legislative Assembly from the [[Mattannur]] constituency. In 1960, he again represented Mattannur. In 1964, when the communist movement split into two on some ideological differences, Balaram stood with the original group known as the CPI ([[Communist Party of India]]). He was a member from the Tellicherry constituency to the Legislative body in 1970. He became a minister in the [[C. Achutha Menon]] ministry and held important portfolios like Industry and Public Relations. Next year he resigned from the ministry to take charge as the State Secretary of the Communist party of India. He held that post till 1984.  Then he became the Secretary of the National Council of the party as well as the Member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament. He held both the posts till his death. He was the leader of the party in parliament also. He headed a  Constitutional Reform Committee of the party when the [[Soviet Crisis]] erupted.

==Other interests==
He was a passionate reader of world literature and a critic of Malayalam literature. He wrote several books on various subjects, which include economics, physics, history, philosophy, politics and archaeology. Once, he was invited by the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh to help the team of archaeologists who held excavation in [[Vijaya Nagara]], knowing fully that he was an expert in [[Pali language]]. During his last days he vehemently opposed the [[Hindutva Movement]] under the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] and wrote books and articles against their activities. His voice was heard even by opponents as it always contained valuable and authentic information and clear analysis.

==Death==
He died of a [[cardiac arrest]] on 16 July 1994, aged 75.&lt;ref&gt;[http://niyamasabha.org/codes/members/m078.htm Kerala Legislature - members page]&lt;/ref&gt; He is survived by his wife and four children.

'''Neon-noir''' cinema is a contemporary rendering of the [[film noir]]. A subset of the [[neo-noir]] genre, both take their name from the films noir: the highly stylised [[Hollywood]] [[crime film|crime dramas]] of the 1940s and 1950s. The term [[film noir]] when translated to English reads "dark film", alluding to the genre's dark or sinister sensibilities. This shaded undertone is highly characteristic of films noir, also marked by their dramatic use of lighting and shadow play, hard-boiled and often complex plot lines, reversed stereotypes, the presence of crime and violence, off-centre and tilted camera angles, cityscape shots or montages, and dreamlike aesthetic, to name but a few.

==Definition==
Neon-noir, like the neo-noir, adopts many of the same sensibilities as the noirs they hark back to. What distinguishes the neon-noir from the larger bracket of neo-noir, is primarily its recollection of the genre's highly stylised use of light. Neon-noir films are characterised by their hyper visual nature; utilising vibrant colours, dynamic (man made) lighting, and highly designed cinematic style to underpin the more seedy elements of the films noir, especially heightening their dream-like aesthetic.

==History==
The term [[film noir]] was originally coined by French critic [[Nino Frank]] in 1946, though wasn’t popularised in the cinematic vocabulary or used in film criticism [[film noir|until much later]]. Due to the term’s [[wikt:retroactive|retroactive]]{{clarify|date=July 2017|"Retroactive up-take" is logically impossible}} up-take, contemporary films of the neo, and more specifically, neon-noir genre, are endowed with a heightened self-awareness of their borrowings from the era of film noir. The presence of crime and violence, hyper-stylised aesthetic, moral ambiguity, and complex narratives continue to permeate the contemporary genre, but with updated themes, and use of technology and media that were absent from the noir films of the 40’s and 50’s. 
These characteristics permeate the films of the contemporary genre with their thematic content, aesthetic and sensibility as harking back to the film noir period.

Neon-noir film borrows from and reflects many of the characteristics of the film noir: a presence of crime, violence,  complex characters and plot-lines, mystery, ambiguity and moral ambivalence, all come into play in the neon-noir genre. But more so than the superficial traits of the genre, neon noir emphasises the socio-critique of film noir, recalling the specific socio-cultural dimensions of the interwar years when noirs first became prominent; a time of global existential crisis, depression and the mass movement of rural persons towards the cities. Long shots or montages of cityscapes, often portrayed as dark and menacing were suggestive of what Dueck referred to as a ‘bleak societal perspective’,&lt;ref&gt;Dueck, Cheryl. (November 2016) 'Secret Police in Style: The Aesthetics of Remembering Socialism'.
 A Journal of Germanic Studies, Volume 52:4&lt;/ref&gt; providing a critique on [[global capitalism]] and [[consumerism]]. Other tactics also made use of heavily stylised lighting techniques such the [[chiaroscuro]] juxtaposition of light and dark, with neon signs and brightly lit buildings providing a sense of [[Social alienation|alienation]] and [[entrapment]].

Accentuating the already present use of artificial or neon lighting in the noir films of the 40’s and 50’s, neon-noir films imbue this aesthetic style with electrifying colour and manipulated light to accentuate their socio-cultural critique as backdrop to thematic references to contemporary and pop culture. In doing so, films of the neon-noir genre orbit the themes of urban decay, consumerist decadence and capitalism, [[existentialism]], sexuality and issues of [[race and violence]] in the contemporary cultural landscape, not only of America, but the globalised world at large.

Neon-noirs seek to bring the contemporary noir, somewhat diluted under the umbrella of neo-noir, back into the exploration of culture: class, race, gender, patriarchy, capitalism are key thematic references and departures for the neon-noir; an existential confrontation of society in a hyper technological and golbalised world. Illustrating society as decadent and [[consumerist]], and identity as confused and anxious, neon-noirs reposition the contemporary noir in [[urban decay]], often setting their scenes in the underground city-haunts; brothels, nightclubs, casinos, strip bars, pawnshops, Laundromats, etc.

Neon noirs were popularised in the 70’s and 80’s by films like ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982), and [[David Lynch]] films such as ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986) and later, ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997). In the more current cinematic landscape, films like [[Harmony Korine]]’s highly provocative ''[[Spring Breakers]]'', and [[Danny Boyle]]’s ''[[Trance (2013 film)|Trance]]'' (2013) have been especially recognised for their neon-infused rendering of the noir genre; While ''Trance'' was celebrated for ‘shak(ing) the ingredients (of the noir) like coloured sand in a jar’, ''Spring Breakers'' notoriously produced a [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/22/spring-breakers-fever-dream_n_2929231.html slew of criticism]&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Christopher. '‘Spring Breakers’ Is A ‘Fever Dream’; Or, The Most Common Description Of Harmony Korine’s New Film [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/22/spring-breakers-fever-dream_n_2929231.html]'&lt;/ref&gt; referring to its ‘fever-dream’ aesthetic and ‘neon-caked explosion of excess’ (Kohn).&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, Eric.'From 'Trance' to 'Spring Breakers,' Is This the Golden Age of Film Noir?'. March 23, 2016. [http://www.indiewire.com/2013/03/from-trance-to-spring-breakers-is-this-the-golden-age-of-film-noir-39990/ Indiewire Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Another neon-noir endowed with the [http://screenanarchy.com/2017/07/exclusive-clip-the-persian-connection-a-man-a-woman-a-nightclub.html 'fever-dream'] aesthetic is [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4831810/ The Persian Connection], expressly linked to Lynchian aesthetics as a neon-drenched contemporary noir.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.us-iran.org/news/2017/7/10/reza-sixo-safai-on-his-film-the-persian-connection&lt;/ref&gt;

Neon-noir can be seen as a response to the over-use of the term neo-noir. While the contemporary term neo-noir functions to bring the noir into the contemporary landscape, it has been often criticised for its dilution of the noir genre, Arnett commenting on its ‘amorphous’ reach: ‘any film featuring a detective or crime qualifies’, and Cawelti recognising its ‘generic exhaustion’.&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, Robert (October 2006) Eighties Noir: The Dissenting Voice in Reagan's America'. [[Journal of Popular Film and Television]] : 123&lt;/ref&gt; The neon-noir, more specifically, seeks to revive the noir sensibilities in a more targeted manner of reference, focalising especially its socio-cultural commentary and hyper-stylised aesthetic.

==Geographical distribution==

===India===

Odia is mainly spoken in the state of Odisha, but there are significant Odia-speaking populations in the neighbouring states, such as [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[West Bengal]], [[Jharkhand]], and [[Chhattisgarh]]; as well as in the neighbouring country of [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=James Minahan |title=Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abNDLZQ6quYC&amp;pg=PA233 |year=2012 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-59884-659-1 |page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the increasing migration of labour, the west Indian state of [[Gujarat]] also has a significant population of Odia speakers, with [[Surat]] being the city with largest Odia-speaking population in Gujarat.&lt;ref&gt;http://indiapopulation2018.in/population-of-surat-2018.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2018}} Significant numbers of Odia speakers can also be found in the cities of [[Vishakhapatnam]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], [[Bangalore]], [[Chennai]], [[Goa]], [[Mumbai]], [[Raipur]], [[Jamshedpur]], [[Baroda]], [[Ahmedabad]], [[New Delhi]], [[Kolkata]], [[Kharagpur, West Bengal|Kharagpur]], [[Guwahati]], [[Shillong]], [[Pune]], and [[Silvassa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mapsofindia.com/events/republic-day/offical-languages-india.html |title= Official and Regional Languages of India |date= 2011-01-25 |accessdate= 2012-11-29 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130308031031/http://www.mapsofindia.com/events/republic-day/offical-languages-india.html |archive-date= 2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2018}}

==History==

[[File:Script Tree of India.jpg|thumb|Script Tree of India]]
[[File:Evolution of Oriya Language.jpg|thumb|A detailed chart depicting evolution of the Odia script as displayed in a museum at [[Ratnagiri, Odisha]]]]

Odia is an [[List of Eastern Indo-Aryan languages|Eastern Indo-Aryan language]] belonging to the Indo-Aryan language family. It is thought to be directly descended from an Odra[[Magadhi Prakrit]] similar to [[Ardha Magadhi]], which was spoken in eastern India over 1,500 years ago, and is the primary language used in early [[Jainism|Jain]] texts.&lt;ref name="The Harvard Lecture"&gt;Misra, Bijoy (April 11, 2009). [http://www.odia.org/articles/harvardLecture.pdf Oriya Language and Literature] (PDF) (Lecture). Languages and Literature of India. Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt; Odia appears to have had relatively little influence from [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], compared to other major North Indian languages.

The history of the Odia language is divided into eras:

* Old Odia (12th century and earlier): Inscriptions from 10th century onwards provide evidence for the existence of the Old Odia language, although the earliest known inscription that actually contains Odia lines is dated to 1249 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=B.

* Early Middle Odia (1200–1400): The earliest use of prose can be found in the ''[[Madala Panji]]'' of the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple at Puri]], which dates back to the 12th century. Such works as ''Shishu Veda'', ''Amara Kosha'', ''Gorakha Samhita'', ''Kalasha Chautisha'', and ''Saptanga'' are written in this form of Odia.&lt;ref name="patnaik 1989"&gt;{{cite book |last= Patnaik |first=Durga|title=Palm Leaf Etchings of Orissa |year=1989 |publisher= Abhinav Publications |place=New Delhi |isbn= 978-8170172482 |url= {{Google books |id=90_qAeMT1bwC |page=11 |plainurl=yes}} |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="panda"&gt;{{cite book |last=Panda |first=Shishir |title= Medieval Orissa: A Socio-economic Study |year=1991 |publisher= Mittal Publications |place=New Delhi |isbn= 978-8170992615 |url={{Google books|id=C_LT5Q-f3YEC |page=106 |plainurl= yes}}|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="patnaik 1997"&gt;{{cite book |last= Patnaik |first=Nihar |title =Economic History of Orissa |year=1997 |publisher= Indus Publishing |place=New Delhi |isbn= 978-8173870750 |url= {{Google books |id= 1AA9W9_4Z9gC |page=149 |plainurl=yes}} |page= 149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Middle Odia (1400–1700): [[Sarala Das]] writes the ''[[Vilanka Ramayana]]''.&lt;ref name="Sukhdeva2002"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sukhdeva |title=Living Thoughts of the Ramayana |url={{Google books|id=BMyxwk5g3NEC&amp;pg=PT7|plainurl=yes}}|year=2002 |publisher=Jaico Publishing House |isbn=978-81-7992-002-2 |pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mukherjee1998"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sujit Mukherjee |title=A Dictionary of Indian Literature: Beginnings-1850 |url={{Google books|id=YCJrUfVtZxoC&amp;pg=PA420|plainurl=yes}}|date=1998 |publisher=Orient Blackswan |isbn=978-81-250-1453-9 |pages=420}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the 16th century, poets emerged around the [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] leader [[Acyutananda|Achyutananda]], These five poets are Balaram Das, [[Jagannatha Dasa (Odia poet)|Jagannatha Dasa]], Achyutananda, Ananta Dasa and Jasobanta Dasa.
* Late Middle Odia (1700–1850): ''Ushabhilasa'' of Sisu Sankara Das, the ''Rahasya Manjari'' of Deba Durlabha Dasa and the ''Rukmini Bibha'' of Kartika Dasa were written. A new form of metrical epic-poems (called ''Chhanda-Kabya'') evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when Ramachandra Pattanayaka wrote ''Haravali.'' [[Upendra Bhanja]] took a leading role in this period- his creations ''Baidehisha Bilasa'', ''Koti Brahmanda Sundari'', ''Labanyabati'' were landmarks in Odia Literature. Dinakrushna Dasa's ''Rasokallola'' and Abhimanyu Samanta Singhara's ''Bidagdha Chintamani'' are prominent Kavyas of this time. Four major poets emerged in the end of the era are [[Baladeba Rath]], Bhima Bhoi, [[Brajanath Badajena]] and Gopala Krushna Pattanaik.
* Modern Odia (1850 till present day): The first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by the Christian missionaries which made a great revolution in Odia literature and language.

[[File:East-Hem 200ad.jpg|thumb|Eastern Hemisphere in the year 200.]]

===Charyapada of 8th Century and its affinity with Odia language===
The beginnings of Odia poetry coincide with the development of ''charya sahitya'', the literature started by [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhist poets]] such as in the ''Charyapada''. This literature was written in a specific metaphor called [[twilight language]] and prominent poets included [[Luipa]], [[Tilopa]] and [[Kanha (poet)|Kanha]]. Quite importantly, the Ragas that have mentioned for singing the Charyapadas are found abundantly in latter Odia literature.

===Poet Jayadeva's literary contribution===
[[Jayadeva]] was a Sanskrit poet. He was born in an [[Utkala Brahmin]] family of Puri in circa 1200&amp;nbsp;AD. He is most known for his composition, the epic poem [[Gita Govinda]], which depicts the divine love of the Hindu deity Krishna and his consort, Radha, and is considered an important text in the Bhakti movement of Hinduism. About the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th, the influence of [[Works of Jayadeva|Jayadeva's literary contribution]] changed the pattern of versification in Odia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[John Beames]], a British author and civil servant in [[British India]] who stayed for a considerable time in Odisha and worked for the survival of Odia language quotes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At a period when Odia was already a fixed and settled language, Bengali did not exist. The Bengalis spoke a vast variety of corrupt forms of Eastern Hindi. It is not till quite recent times that we find anything that can with propriety be called a Bengali language.&lt;ref&gt;Beames, ''Comparative Grammar of Four Languages'' Vol I, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Dialects have bit of variety from the literary language, and Bengal circulated in a vast region so that it have  some varieties, called dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bangla Sahityer Itibritwwo|last=Bondyopadhyay|first=Asit kumar|publisher=Morden Book Agency Pvt, Limited|year=1959|isbn=|location=Kolkata|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odia circulated in a small region and less no of speaker that's why variety is very less, rather it have a similarity to Bengali language.

We may place the Hindi with its subsidiary forms Gujurati and Punjabi first fixing their rise and establishment as a modern languages distinct from their previous existence as Prakrit till the 12th or 13th century. Odia must have quite completed its transformation by the end of the 14th century. Bengali was no separate independent language but a maze of dialects without a distinct national or provincial type till the 17th or beginning of the 18th century. It was not till the gradual decay of the central Mohammedan power of Delhi enabled the provincial governors to assume an independent position that Bengali severed itself from Hindi and assumed characteristics which now vindicate for its right to be called a separate language.&lt;ref&gt;Beames, ''Comparative Grammar of Four Languages'', Vol I, p.120&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Phonology==

==Morphology==
{{Main|Odia morphology}}
Unlike [[Hindi]], Odia retains most of the cases of [[Sanskrit]], though the nominative and vocative have merged (both without a separate marker), as have the accusative and dative. There are three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter) and two grammatical numbers (singular and plural). There are three true tenses (present, past and future), others being formed with auxiliaries.

The earliest literature in Odia language can be traced to the Charyapadas composed in the 7th to 9th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Medieval Indian Literature: Surveys and selections|url = {{Google books|id=KYLpvaKJIMEC|plainurl=yes}}|publisher = Sahitya Akademi|date = 1997-01-01|isbn = 9788126003655}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Sarala Das, the most important works in Odia literature are the Shishu Veda, Saptanga, Amara Kosha, Rudrasudhanidhi, Kesaba Koili, Kalasha Chautisha etc.&lt;ref name="patnaik 1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="panda" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patnaik 1997" /&gt; In the 14th century, the poet [[Sarala Dasa]]'s wrote the [[Sarala Mahabharata]], [[Chandi Purana]], and [[Vilanka Ramayana]], in praise of the goddess [[Durga]]. [[Rama-bibaha]], written by [[Arjuna Dasa]], was the first long poem written in the Odia language.

The following era is termed the [[Odia Literature|Panchasakha Age]] and stretches until the year 1700. The period begins with the writings of [[Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] whose Vaishnava influence brought in a new evolution in Odia literature.  Notable religious works of the Panchasakha Age include those of [[Balarama Dasa]], [[Jagannatha Dasa (Odia poet)|Jagannatha Dasa]], [[Yasovanta]], Ananta and [[Acyutananda]]. The authors of this period mainly translated, adapted, or imitated Sanskrit literature. Other prominent works of the period include the [[Usabhilasa]] of [[Sisu Sankara Dasa]], the [[Rahasya-manjari]] of [[Deva-durlabha Dasa]] and the Rukmini-bibha of [[Kartikka Dasa]]. A new form of novels in verse evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when [[Ramachandra Pattanayaka]] wrote Haravali. Other poets like Madhusudana, [[Bhima Bhoi]], [[Dhivara]], [[Sadasiva]] and [[Sisu Isvara-dasa]] composed another form called [[kavyas]] (long poems) based on themes from Puranas, with an emphasis on plain, simple language.

However, during the [[Odia literature#Age of Upendra Bhanja|Bhanja Age]] (also known as the Age of Riti Yuga) beginning with turn of the 18th century, verbally tricky Odia became the order of the day. Verbal jugglery, obscenity and eroticism characterise the period between 1700 and 1850, particularly in the works of the era's eponymous poet [[Upendra Bhanja]] (1670–1720). Bhanja's work inspired many imitators of which the most notable is Arakshita Das. Family chronicles in prose relating religious festivals and rituals are also characteristic of the period.

The first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by Christian missionaries. Although the handwritten Odia script of the time closely resembled the [[Bengali script|Bengali]] and [[Assamese script]]s, the one adopted for the printed typesets was significantly different, leaning more towards the [[Tamil script]] and [[Telugu script]]. [[Amos Sutton]] produced an Oriya Bible (1840), Oriya Dictionary (1841–43) and&lt;ref&gt;Biswamoy Pati Situating social history: Orissa, 1800-1997 p30&lt;/ref&gt; ''An Introductory Grammar of Oriya'' (1844).&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj To Jyoti):   2 p1030 ed. Amaresh Datta - 2006 "Amos Sutton also prepared a dictionary named Sadhu bhasharthabhidhan, a vocabulary of current Sanskrit terms with Odia definitions which was also printed in Odisha Mission Press in 1844."&lt;/ref&gt;

Odia has a rich literary heritage dating back to the thirteenth century. [[Sarala Dasa]] who lived in the fourteenth century is known as the [[Vyasa]] of Odisha. He translated the [[Mahabharata]] into Odia. In fact, the language was initially standardised through a process of translating classical Sanskrit texts such as the Mahabharata, [[Ramayana]] and Srimad Bhagabata Gita. The translation of the Srimad Bhagabata Gita by Jagannatha Dasa was particularly influential on the written form of the language. Odia has had a strong tradition of poetry, especially [[worship|devotional]] poetry.

Other eminent Odia poets include [[Kabi Samrat Upendra Bhanja]] and [[Kavisurya Baladev Rath|Kabisurya Baladev Ratha]].

Prose in the language has had a late development.

Three great poets and prose writers, [[Kabibar Radhanath Ray]] (1849–1908), [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]] (1843–1918) and [[Madhusudan Rao]] (1853–1912)  made Odia their own. They brought in a modern outlook and spirit into Odia literature. Around the same time the modern drama took birth in the works of [[Rama Sankara]] Ray beginning with Kanci-Kaveri (1880).

Among the contemporaries of Fakir Mohan, four novelists deserve special mention: Aparna Panda, Mrutyunjay Rath, Ram Chandra Acharya and Brajabandhu Mishra. Aparna Panda's Kalavati and Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati were both published in 1902, the year in which Chha Mana Atha Guntha came out in the book form. Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati, which came out from Bamanda, depicts the conflict between a poor but highly educated young man and a wealthy and highly egoistic young woman whose conjugal life is seriously affected by ego clashes. Through a story of union, separation and reunion, the novelist delineates the psychological state of a young woman in separation from her husband and examines the significance of marriage as a social institution in traditional Indian society. Ram Chandra Acharya wrote about seven novels during 1924-1936. All his novels are historical romances based on the historical events in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Odisha. Mrutyunjay Rath's novel, Adbhuta Parinama, published in 1915, centres round a young Hindu who gets converted to Christianity to marry a Christian girl.

One of the great writers in the 19th century was Pandit [[Krushna Chandra Kar]] (1907-1995) from Cuttack, who wrote many books for children like ''Pari Raija, Kuhuka Raija, Panchatantra, Adi Jugara Galpa Mala'', etc. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1971-72 for his contributions to Odia literature, development of children's fiction, and biographies.

One of the prominent writers of the 19th and 20th centuries was [[Muralidhar Mallick]] (1927–2002). His contribution to Historical novels is beyond words. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1998 for his contributions to Odia literature. His son [[Khagendranath Mallick]] (born 1951) is also a writer. His contribution towards poetry, criticism, essays, story and novels is commendable. He was the former President of Utkal Kala Parishad and also former President of Odisha Geeti Kabi Samaj. Presently he is a member of the Executive Committee of Utkal Sahitya Samaj. Another illustrious writer of the 20th century was Mr. Chintamani Das. A noted academician, he was written more than 40 books including fiction, short stories, biographies and storybooks for children. Born in 1903 in Sriramachandrapur village under Satyabadi block, Chintamani Das is the only writer who has written biographies on all the five 'Pancha Sakhas' of Satyabadi namely Pandit Gopabandhu Das, Acharya Harihara, Nilakantha Das, Krupasindhu Mishra and Pandit Godabarisha. Having served as the Head of the Odia department of Khallikote College, Berhampur, Chintamani Das was felicitated with the Sahitya Akademi Samman in 1970 for his outstanding contribution to Odia literature in general and Satyabadi Yuga literature in particular. Some of his well-known literary creations are 'Bhala Manisha Hua', 'Manishi Nilakantha', 'Kabi Godabarisha', 'Byasakabi Fakiramohan', 'Usha', 'Barabati'.

20th century writers in Odia include Pallikabi [[Nanda Kishore Bal]] (1875–1928), [[Gangadhar Meher]] (1862–1924), [[Chintamani Mahanti]] and [[Kuntala-Kumari Sabat Utkala-Bharati]], besides [[Niladri Dasa]] and [[Gopabandhu Das]] (1877–1928). The most notable novelists were [[Umesa Sarakara]], [[Divyasimha Panigrahi]], [[Gopala Praharaja]] and [[Kalindi Charan Panigrahi]]. [[Sachi Kanta Rauta Ray]] is the great introducer of the ultra-modern style in modern Odia poetry. Others who took up this form were [[Godabarisha Mohapatra]], [[Mayadhara Manasimha]], [[Nityananda Mahapatra]] and [[Kunjabihari Dasa]]. [[Prabhasa Chandra Satpathi]] is known for his translations of some western classics apart from [[Udayanatha Shadangi]], [[Sunanda Kara]] and [[Surendranatha Dwivedi]]. Criticism, essays and history also became major lines of writing in the Odia language. Esteemed writers in this field were Professor [[Girija Shankar Ray]], [[Pandit Vinayaka Misra]], Professor [[Gauri Kumara Brahma]], [[Jagabandhu Simha]] and [[Harekrushna Mahatab]]. Odia literature mirrors the industrious, peaceful and artistic image of the [[Odia people]] who have offered and gifted much to the Indian civilization in the field of art and literature. Now Writers [[Manoj Das]]'s creations motivated and inspired people towards a positive lifestyle .Distinguished prose writers of the modern period include [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]], [[Madhusudan Das]], Godabarisha Mohapatra, Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, [[Surendra Mohanty]], [[Manoj Das]],  Kishori Charan Das, Gopinath Mohanty, Rabi Patnaik, Chandrasekhar Rath, Binapani Mohanty, [[Bhikari Rath]], [[Jagadish Mohanty]], [[Sarojini Sahoo]], [[Yashodhara Mishra]], Ramchandra Behera, Padmaja Pal. But it is poetry that makes modern Odia literature a force to reckon with. Poets like [[Kabibar Radhanath Ray]], Sachidananda Routray, Guruprasad Mohanty, Soubhagya Misra, [[Ramakanta Rath]], Sitakanta Mohapatra, Rajendra Kishore Panda, Pratibha Satpathy have made significant contributions towards Indian poetry.

[[Anita Desai]]'s novella, ''Translator Translated'', from her collection ''The Art of Disappearance'', features a translator of a fictive Odian short story writer; the novella contains a discussion of the perils of translating works composed in regional Indian languages into English.

Four writers in Odia - [[Gopinath Mohanty]], [[Sachidananda Routray]], [[Sitakant Mahapatra]] and [[Pratibha Ray]] - have been awarded the [[Jnanpith Award|Jnanpith]], a prestigious Indian literary award.

'''Ram Ganesh Gadkari''' (May 26, 1885 - January 23, 1919) was a [[Marathi people|Marathi]] poet, playwright, and humorist from [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].

Ram Ganesh Gadkari was one of the writers the in new age transformation in Marathi literature. He wrote poetry under the pen name ''Govindagraj'' and humorous articles under the pen name ''Balakram''. He wrote plays under his legal name.

==Early life==
Gadkari was born on May 26, 1885 in a Marathi [[Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu]] family in the town of ''Ganadevi'' in [[Navsari]] district of [[Gujarat]]. He died at [[Saoner]] near [[Nagpur]] on January 23, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Ram Ganesh Gadkari | author=Ganesh Prabhakar Pradhan | year =1992 | page= 2| publisher = Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi |quote="Ram Ganesh Gadkari was born in a lower middle class Kayastha Prabhu family at Navasari in Surat District of Gujrat, on 26th may , 1885"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father Ganesh Raghunath[Vasudeo] Gadkari died on 24 September 1893, and poverty hindered his timely formal education. He finished his high school education at age 19 and enrolled in [[Pune]]'s [[Fergusson College]]. However, flunking in the mathematics examination, he abandoned his formal education at the end of the first year in college, and took up teaching to support himself while pursuing his keen literary interests. 

Till 19 years of his age, he was unable to speak Marathi. Afterwards, he read and studied [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Sanskrit]], and [[English literature|English]] literature extensively. He critically studied particularly the works of Sanskrit playwrights [[Kālidāsa|Kalidas]] and [[Bhavabhuti]]; modern Marathi poets of his era [[Keshavasuta]] and Shripad Krushna Kolhatkar; Marathi poets of earlier times like [[Dnyaneshwar]] and [[Moropant]]; and English writers like [[Shakespeare]], [[Percy Shelley]], and [[Mark Twain]].

==Personal==
Gadkari was married twice.His first wife Sitabai had left him though according to some contemporaries it was he who had abandoned her. His second wife Rama was younger by some 17 years than him but this too proved to be not a very happy marriage. Gadkari was bitterly disappointed when he realized that marital bliss that he was seeking was not going to come his way.

==Literary work==
Within his short life span of 35 years, Gadkari produced four complete plays, three unfinished plays, 150 poems, and some 
humorous articles. (On the day of his death, he had finished writing just a few hours earlier his play ''Bhava Bandhan'' (भावबंधन).) Literary critics have judged all of his works to be of very high caliber.

===Completed plays===

* Ekach Pyala (एकच प्याला)
* Prema Sanyas (प्रेमसंन्यास)
* Punyaprabhav (पुण्यप्रभाव)
* Bhava Bandhan (भावबंधन)
Celebrated playwright, Vijay Tendulkar considers Gadkari the greatest poet-dramatist in any Indian language after Kalidas. He feels that no other than Gadkari had the genius to describe Sambhaji's extraordinary sacrifice in his struggle against the monstrous emperor Aurangzeb. Similarly, another prominent Marathi literary figure, Acharya Atre, considered Gadkari's contribution to Marathi literature and in particular Marathi drama as one of highest order. He was associated with Kirloskar natak company. His drama ''Ekach Pyala'' was performed by 'Balgandharva' as Sindhu after his death in 1919, which was the story of a poor, devoted wife Sindhu and her alcoholic husband Sudhakar.

There was some speculation that his play ''Ekach Pyala'' was based upon his personal and real experience with hard drinking, but Acharya Atre has convincingly demolished this speculation in his own autobiographical works and has stated that the one obsession that Gadkari had in his entire life was literature. It is to be noted here that Acharya Atre knew Gadkari fairly intimately, and therefore this assertion has a reasonable basis.

===Unfinished plays===

* Garva Nirvan (गर्वनिर्वाण)
* Wedyancha Bajar (वेड्यांचा बाजार)
* Raj Sanyas (राजसंन्यास)

===Poetry===

* Vagvaijayanti (वाग्वैजयंती) (collection of poems)

===Humor===

* ''Balakram'' (बाळकराम) (collection of humorous articles)

==Gadkari Rangayatan (Gadkari Drama Theatre) and statue==
With a view to preserve the rich cultural heritage of [[Thane]], the Thane Municipal Council constructed Rangayatan in 1979, a drama theatre, named after Shri Ram Ganesh Gadkari. The theatre has been hosting different plays and cultural programmes since. Also in Pune city in the well-known [[Sambhaji]] Park Gadkari's statue has been installed. As a matter of coincidence this park is next door to the city's well-known drama theatre Bal Gandharva Ranga Mandir. The statue was uprooted and thrown into the Mutha river by the activists of the [[Maratha]] extremist group, [[Sambhaji Brigade]] on January 3, 2017 because Gadkari showed Sambhaji in a poor light in his incomplete play 'Rajsanyas'. The [[Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu]]([[CKP]]), the community to which Gadkari belonged later organized a meeting to protest this incident at the Gadkari Rangayatan. [[Indian National Congress]] leader [[Nitesh Rane]] rewarded the vandals and made inflammatory remarks claiming that he had announced a reward earlier in 2016 for removing the bust, and was proud of the act carried out by the accused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://punemirror.indiatimes.com/pune/civic/cong-mla-rane-rewards-vandals/articleshow/56606356.cms|title=Cong MLA Rane rewards vandals}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mukherjee|first1=Shoumojit|title=Sambhaji Brigade vandalises statue of litterateur R.G.

Resort fees are illegal in many countries. In other countries, including the United States, there is no specific legislation that either allows or outlaws resort fees.

==Definition==

A resort fee is a daily mandatory additional charge that the hotel separates out from the advertised price. Consumer advocates equate this to paying a second room rate.&lt;ref name="kill-resort-fees-home"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://killresortfees.com/|title=KILL RESORT FEES|website=Kill Resort Fees|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average resort fee is $24.93 per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hucks|first=David|date=2017-01-11|title=Hidden Resort Fees Hurt Tourism – Promote Corruption|url=https://www.myrtlebeachsc.com/hidden-resort-fees-hurt-tourism-promote-corruption/|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-travel-hotels-resortfees-idUSKCN0UQ1MX20160112|title=Hotel travelers gripe as resort fees rise|date=2016-01-12|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be more than the advertised cost of the room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Richberg|first=Kevin|date=2015-09-01|title=Hotel Absurd: When Your Resort Fee Costs More Than Your Room|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kevin-richberg/hotel-absurd-what-to-do-w_b_8068212.html|website=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no limit to what the resort fee can be.

This concept is widely known as [[drip pricing]], particularly in consumer rights contexts.&lt;ref name="ftc-2012"&gt;{{Cite press release|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2012/11/ftc-warns-hotel-operators-price-quotes-exclude-resort-fees-other|title=FTC Warns Hotel Operators that Price Quotes that Exclude 'Resort Fees' and Other Mandatory Surcharges May Be Deceptive|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; One price is advertised out front to lure in a customer but when the customer goes to book there are then mandatory unavoidable fees, taxes and other add-ons that incrementally drip and increase the original advertised price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2012/11/ftc-warns-hotel-operators-price-quotes-exclude-resort-fees-other|title=FTC Warns Hotel Operators that Price Quotes that Exclude 'Resort Fees' and Other Mandatory Surcharges May Be Deceptive|date=2012-11-28|work=Federal Trade Commission|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==

The concept of resort fees originated in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/top-tips-for-keeping-your-holiday-budget-in-check/news-story/e7d9213a60602b64f8a2389e1014cb6c|title=The Mercury|last=Mitchell|first=Celeste|date=May 7, 2018|work=The Mercury|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though mostly found in tourist destinations in the United States, some resorts in Mexico and the Caribbean also charge resort fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlantisbahamas.com/terms|title=Resort Fee Terms and Conditions, The Atlantis|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A handful of hotels in Canada have also recently taken up the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fairmont.com/whistler/activities-services/guest-services/resort-fee/|title=Resort Fee Charge - Fairmont Hotel|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resort fees are most prevalent in tourist locations and are usually seen as a nuisance by travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.frommers.com/deals/hotels/how-to-get-out-of-paying-a-hotels-resort-feeit-can-be-done|title=How to Get Out of Paying a Hotel's Resort Fee—It Can Be Done!|last=Shallcross|first=Juliana|date=|work=Frommer's|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/travel/ct-mandatory-resort-fees-on-the-rise-20170728-story.html|title=Mandatory resort fees are on the rise - again|last=Elliott|first=Christopher|date=|website=The Chicago Tribune|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also affect international tourists who are unfamiliar with the breakdown of a US hotel bill and may not speak English.&lt;ref name="kill-resort-fees-home" /&gt;

Resort fees are also commonly located in tourist areas, where there is collusion, and every hotel decides to charge resort fees. Currently, resort fees apply to all 62,000 rooms on the Las Vegas Strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://killresortfees.com/vegas|title=VEGAS|website=Kill Resort Fees|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resort fees, along with the recent introduction parking charges (neither of which are typically charged at the numerous alternative gaming locations in the United States), are believed to be a major cause of a reduction in tourism to Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/lasvegas/la-tr-las-vegas-fees-may-mean-fewer-visitors-20180501-story.html|title=Fewer people are visiting Las Vegas.

Resort fees are not found just at resorts. Many budget hotels also charge resort fees. The Days Inn in Miami Beach, the Super 8 in Las Vegas and the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City are all two star hotels that charge resort fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.daysinn.com/hotels/florida/miami-beach/days-inn-and-suites-miami-north-beach-oceanfront/hotel-overview|title=Days Inn &amp; Suites Miami/North Beach Oceanfront {{!}} Miami Beach, FL 33141 Hotel|website=www.daysinn.com|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York City has seen a surge in hotel resort fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/resort-fees-are-no-longer-only-for-resorts-1506078000|title=‘Resort’ Fees Are No Longer Only for Resorts|last=Kirkham|first=Chris|date=September 22, 2017|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City the fees are often called destination fees, facility fees or amenity fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/2018/02/04/grand-hyatt-new-york-destination-fee/|title=The Grand Hyatt New York Has A New $25 Destination Fee|last=Schlappig|first=Ben|date=February 4, 2018|work=One Mile At A Time|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://warwickhotels.com/new-york/services-and-amenities/urban-retreat-fee/|title=Facility Fee - The Warwick|last=|first=|date=|website=The Warwick|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 15 hotels in New York City with resort fees in 2016.

==Background==

Hotels have long charged guests for specific amenities at a hotel, such as for snacks, drinks and use of facilities.&lt;ref name="nyu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scps.nyu.edu/about/newsroom/news/2015/u_s_lodging_industry.html|title=U.S. Lodging Industry Fees and Surcharges Forecast to Increase to a New Record Level in 2015 – $2.47 Billion|website=www.scps.nyu.edu|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 some resort hotels began to charge mandatory fees, regardless of which facilities were actually used by the guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2014/08/25/hotels-fees/|title=Hotels are making record profits from extra fees on stuff you don't use|website=Mashable|agency=Associated Press|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enables the hotel to advertise a cheaper room rate, making up the balance from the mandatory fee.

==Benefit to hotels==
The major benefit to the hotels is the profit, while still being able to show 'reasonable' room prices to the public. Resort fees brought in $2.47 billion to the hotel industry in 2015.&lt;ref name="nyu" /&gt; MGM Resorts International stated that, for Las Vegas hotel rooms in 2011, "Our [[RevPAR]] (revenue per available room) in the first quarter was up 16%, including resort fees. Excluding resort fees, REVPAR was up 11% in the quarter year-over-year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MGM Resorts International Q1 2011 Earnings Call Transcript|date=2011-05-04|url=http://www.morningstar.com/earnings/PrintTranscript.aspx?id=25423704|website=morningstar.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320095351/http://www.morningstar.com/earnings/PrintTranscript.aspx?id=25423704|archive-date=2012-03-20|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online hotel search and booking tools like Expedia, Travelocity and Hotel Tonight take a percentage of a reservation and then pass the reservation on to the hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://skift.com/2015/02/19/what-expedia-and-priceline-growth-means-to-an-independent-hotel/|title=What Expedia and Priceline Growth Means to an Independent Hotel|date=2015-02-19|website=Skift|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hotel loses a certain percentage from every reservation made on one of the sites. Hotels that charge resort fees but are listed on these hotel search and booking sites list only their advertised rate and not their resort fee. That is because the hotel booking site takes a percentage of that advertised rate. When the hotel collects the resort fee at check in, separately from the rate purchased for online, the hotel collects 100% of that charge.
Resort fees also affect travel agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.travelmarketreport.com/articles/As-Resort-Fees-Increase-Travel-Agents-Talk-Tactics|title=As Resort Fees Increase, Travel Agents Talk Tactics|last=Rosen|first=Cheryl|date=February 22, 2018|work=Travel Market Report|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travel agents can earn commission on the advertised rate of the hotel and do not collect a percentage of taxes or fees. Furthermore, travel agencies must legally know what the resort fee for each hotel is so that they can properly pass it on to their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.travelweekly.com/Mark-Pestronk/When-and-where-agents-need-to-disclose-resort-fees|title=Resort fees: When and where agents need to disclose them|last=Pestronk|first=Mark|date=February 3, 2016|work=Travel Weekly|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to do so could result in a lawsuit to their agency. Individual travel agents have found it difficult to keep up with changing hotel resort fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.travelweekly.com/Mark-Pestronk/When-and-where-agents-need-to-disclose-resort-fees|title=Resort fees: When and where agents need to disclose them: Travel Weekly|website=www.travelweekly.com|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hotels and Resorts also often collect Resort Fees from guests who are paying for their stay with loyalty points, since the Resort Fee is categorized a mandatory charge for bundled services as opposed to part of the room rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/clairetsosie/2018/09/28/how-to-keep-sneaky-fees-from-derailing-your-free-travel/#31ff79c11946|title=How To Keep Sneaky Fees From Derailing Your 'Free' Travel|website=https://www.forbes.com|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefit to consumers==

The [[American Hotel and Lodging Association]] has stated that the resort fee provides many benefits to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resort Fees Overview|url=https://www.ahla.com/issues/resort-fees|website=AHLA|publisher=American Hotel and Lodging Association|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hotels say that customers like many features and amenities of the hotel to be included in the resort fee to avoid nickel and diming,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wxyz.com/money/consumer/dont-waste-your-money/watch-out-for-resort-fees-when-you-book-your-next-hotel-stay|title=Watch out for resort fees when you book your next hotel stay|last=|first=|date=December 21, 2017|work=ABC 7 Detroit|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no proof that any services are included in the fees, which leads many consumers to deem it to be dishonest pricing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hotelmanagement.net/dishonest-fees-will-lead-to-future-failure|title=Hotel and resort fees are driving a wedge between guests and properties|last=Haussman|first=Glenn|date=May 16, 2016|work=Hotel Management|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MGM Resorts International]] senior vice president Alan Feldman,has said “We have heard negative feedback from guests, but we’ve also heard positive feedback, from guests who are happy that they are no longer paying [[à la carte]] for different services. They don’t feel nickeled and dimed.”&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Segal|first=David|date=2011-09-24|title=Now You Don’t See Extra Fees, Now You Do|department=Your Money|website=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/your-money/hidden-fees-in-travel-deals-revisited.html|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exchange for service ==
Hotels have stated that tourists are paying a resort fee for a variety of amenities at the hotel. The American Hotel and Lodging Association said that resort fees pay for a range of hotel amenities, such as pool use, gym access, towel services, Wi-Fi, newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://skift.com/2016/01/13/resort-fees-are-on-the-rise-and-consumers-arent-happy/|title=Resort Fees Are on the Rise and Consumers Aren't Happy|date=2016-01-13|website=Skift|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; They state that the resort fee is a payment for a group of services.

Consumer advocates such as the National Consumers League&lt;ref name="national-consumers-league"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Young|first=Brian|date=October 2016|title=What's wrong with hotel resort fees?|url=http://www.nclnet.org/resort_fees|publisher=National Consumers League|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Travelers United&lt;ref name="travelers-united"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hotelfees.travelersunited.org/|title=End Hotel and Resort Fees –|website=hotelfees.travelersunited.org|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; have stated that since it is a mandatory fee, it is not an exchange of service. A guest could decline all of the services allegedly offered by the resort fee and still be forced to pay the resort fee. The advocates state that there is no exchange of service. It is simply an additional amount that the hotel collects, on top of the advertised room rate.

Most hotels tax the resort fee at the hotel occupancy tax rate. This is a tax rate reserved for hotel room rates. Services are taxed at the sales tax rate in the United States. The hotel occupancy tax is higher than the sales tax rate. Consumer advocates argue this shows that the hotel resort fee is considered part of the room rate for the hotel and for tax purposes, not an exchange of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecapitolforum.cmail19.com/t/ViewEmail/j/FC4EBD0280DB1E6A2540EF23F30FEDED/60089AD0AA3F39B520B193FBA00ED1DB|title=Marriott: Multi-State Investigation into Company’s Use of Resort Fees; A Closer Look at Regulatory Risk Associated with Resort Fees|website=thecapitolforum.cmail19.com|access-date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A direct exchange of service, such as a hotel charge of bringing an extra bed to the room, would always be taxed at sales tax. A resort fee is normally not taxed as an exchange of service, but as a second room rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.travelersunited.org/hotel-fees/new-york-city-hotel-resort-fees/|title=New York City Hotel Resort Fees|last=Wolfe|first=Lauren|date=August 11, 2017|website=Travelers United|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eturbonews.com/81398/tax-evasion-hawaiian-hotels-and-resorts-style|title=Tax evasion: Hawaiian hotels and resorts style?|last=|first=|date=January 8, 2014|work=eTurbo News|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disclosure of fees==

Resort fees have been criticized by consumers for not being fairly advertised prior to purchase.&lt;ref name="nyu" /&gt;

Katherine Lugar, president and Chief Executive Officer of the American Hotel and Lodging Association said that “throughout the booking process, hotels are transparent about costs, fees and taxes.”&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; That assertion has been debated by consumer advocates. They argue that though hotels may list a resort fee, they do so at the very end of the booking process in extremely small print. Charlie Leocha, President of Travelers United, said "The charging of mandatory resort fees by hotels results in a misrepresentation of the true price of the hotel room."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/is-the-ftc-doing-enough-to-stop-resort-fees/2015/07/09/df8e8a5a-2401-11e5-b72c-2b7d516e1e0e_story.html|title=Is the FTC doing enough to stop those mysterious hotel ‘resort fees’?|last=Elliott|first=Christopher|date=2015-07-09|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes hotels improperly list the fee as a tax.&lt;ref name="cbsnews" /&gt; The Arizona Grand Resort &amp; Spa lists its resort fee under taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://res.windsurfercrs.com/ibe/index.aspx?propertyID=13820&amp;nono=1&amp;_ga=2.159754555.700105045.1526254895-1929178016.1526254895|title=Arizona Grand Resort &amp; Spa|last=|first=|date=|website=Arizona Grand Resort &amp; Spa|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Life Hotel in New York City lists their fee as an "NYC mandatory City Hotel Fee."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lifehotel.com/|title=The Life Hotel|last=|first=|date=|website=The Life Hotel|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A resort fee is not a tax nor is it a mandatory city hotel fee. 

Consumer advocates have noted that if consumers choose to book their hotel based on price-based search tools on Expedia, Priceline, or Hotel Tonight, the resort fees are left off in the initial price comparison search. A hotel could be anywhere from $10 to $50 more expensive per night, but it is not listed with the advertised price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.expedia.com/OpaqueResortFees|title=Expedia Unpublished Rate Hotel: Resort Fees|website=www.expedia.com|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Priceline spokeswoman, Flavie Lemarchand-Wood, said the practice of tacking added fees onto the advertised price after a hotel is selected is not deceptive: "We are compliant in disclosing the fees prior to purchase. It is very important [for the consumer] to read everything on the page"&lt;ref name="cbsnews" /&gt; Expedia, Priceline and Hotel Tonight do not take commission from the resort fee. These online booking companies have no incentive to publish the resort fee. The hotel takes the entire amount of the resort fee. These companies are further disincentivized since if one site begins to add the resort fee to the advertised rate, it will look like the price on that site is higher and consumers would go to a competing online booking site.&lt;ref name="cbsnews" /&gt; 

Consumers groups such as Travelers United and Kill Resort Fees contend if a hotel charges a mandatory fee, it should be included the nightly room rate.&lt;ref name="travelers-united" /&gt; Hotel rating systems, such as AAA, have taken a policy of deducting points from a hotel being reviewed if they charge resort fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsroom.aaa.com/2012/07/new-aaa-hotel-rating-guidelines-accommodate-member-expectations-for-resort-and-wi-fi-fees/|title=New AAA Hotel Rating Guidelines Accommodate Member Expectations for Resort and Wi-Fi Fees|date=2012-07-31|website=AAA NewsRoom|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; AAA has said resort fees are a major annoyance of travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/lissapoirot/status/733335546962051074?lang=en|title=Lissa Poirot on Twitter|website=Twitter|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frommer's travel guides have come out with numerous articles against hotel resort fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.frommers.com/deals/hotels/how-to-get-out-of-paying-a-hotels-resort-feeit-can-be-done|title=How to Get Out of Paying a Hotel's Resort Fee—It Can Be Done!|last=Shallcross|first=Juliana|date=|work=Frommer's|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.frommers.com/blogs/arthur-frommer-online/blog_posts/resort-fees-are-a-tax-dodge-why-they-re-destructive-for-us-all|title=Resort Fees Are a Tax Dodge: Why They're Destructive for Us All|last=Cochran|first=Jason|date=February 21, 2018|work=Frommer's|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taxes ==
Since resort fees are a mandatory fee that is not included in the advertised room rate of the hotel, the fee can be taxed differently from the advertised room rate. Resort fees in Nevada are treated and taxed as a hotel room at hotel occupancy tax. Both hotel rooms and resort fees in Nevada are taxed at 13.38%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/nation-now/2017/03/03/caesars-mgm-up-resort-fees-las-vegas-strip/98701148/|title=Caesars, MGM raise resort fees on the Las Vegas Strip|last=Curtis|first=Anthony|date=March 3, 2017|work=USA Today|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2016/aug/01/chasing-the-room-tax-percentage-tacked-on-to-touri/|title=Chasing the room tax: Percentage tacked onto tourists’ bills has made enduring impact on valley|last=Morris|first=J.D.|date=August 1, 2016|work=Las Vegas Sun|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resort fees at many hotels in New York are taxed at 8.875% instead of the hotel occupancy tax of 14.75%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.frommers.com/blogs/arthur-frommer-online/blog_posts/resort-fees-are-a-tax-dodge-why-they-re-destructive-for-us-all|title=Resort Fees Are a Tax Dodge: Why They're Destructive for Us All|last=Cochran|first=Jason|date=February 21, 2018|work=Frommer's|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a 5.875% tax loss for New York City per resort fee per room per night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rownyc.com/|title=Times Square Hotel - NYC Hotel - Row NYC|website=Row NYC Hotel|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer advocates estimate that hotel resort fees in New York City cause $10 million of lost tax revenue annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://killresortfees.com/newyorkcity/|title=Kill Resort Fees - New York City|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
===Australia===
In Australia, under the [[Australian Consumer Law]], it is illegal to charge, or even advertise it is a requirement to pay, mandatory fees (including resort fees), if they were not reflected in a total cost as a single figure at the time of booking. Under Australian law, any fees that are mandatory and are able to be calculated, including resort fees, must be included as a part of the total price in a single figure at the time of booking, deliberately doing otherwise are grounds for prosecution for misleading and unconscionable conduct.

When advertising the sale price of a consumer good or service (i.e. non business-to-business transactions) a price "must state the total price of the good or service as a single figure, which is the minimum total cost that is able to be calculated. This should include any tax, duty, fee, levy or other additional charges."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Displaying prices|website=Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission|url=https://www.accc.gov.au/business/pricing-surcharging/displaying-prices|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this requirement under Australian law, unlike the U.S., consumer goods and services always have ticket prices which reflect the actual monetary cost which a consumer pays out of pocket, with no additional tax or fees calculated on top at [[point of sale]].

Additionally, by virtue of Australian anti-price drip laws, it is also not sufficient, and it is illegal, to add a mandatory fee (including resort fees) in circumstances where it was only disclosed and added to the final single figure in the late stages of a booking process. This price-dripping practice constitutes a [[bait and switch]] tactic which is misleading and detrimental to both consumers and competitors. Any mandatory fee must be included in the single figure which is advertised, it must be disclosed, and the disclosure must be early on in the booking process.

In order to protect Australian consumers, heavy penalties are applied and enforced (up to hundreds of thousands of dollars) for each instance of a breach of the Australian Consumer Law provisions.

===Europe===
In the [[European Economic Area]], which comprises the [[European Union]] plus three more countries, Articles 5(1)(c) and 6(1)(e) of [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex:32011L0083 Directive 2011/83/EU (Consumer Rights Directive)] require businesses to quote "''the total price of the goods or services inclusive of taxes''". Therefore it is unlawful to charge or advertise unavoidable fees and taxes that are not included within the total room rate, such as resort fees and city taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2014/12/24/hidden-hotel-fees/|title=Travel watchdog warns vacationers about resort fees hidden in the small print|last=Plautz|first=Jessica|website=Mashable|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/donald-trump-turnberry-hotel-resort-fee-nightly-charge-golf-a8269836.html|title=TRUMP BRINGS ILLEGAL US-STYLE ‘RESORT FEES’ TO UK FOR FIRST TIME|last=Calder|first=Simon|date=March 23, 2018|work=The Independent|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation also applies when booking non-EEA accommodation via EEA-based travel agents and web sites, which are bound by the same requirement to quote the "''total price''".

===United States===
In the United States, the legality of charging resort fees has been a decades-long issue of contention. Currently there is no U.S. law that allows for hotels to charge mandatory fees in addition to their base room rate. However, there is also no law banning this practice.

Numerous bodies have authority on this issue in the United States, including the [[U.S. Congress]], state legislatures, the [[Federal Trade Commission]], and the [[National Association of Attorneys General]]. So far only 47 Attorneys General have opened an investigation into hotel resort fees. Marriott was issued a subpoena on June 6, 2017 by the Attorney General of Washington, DC regarding their non-cooperation in the investigation, as the hospitality industry continues to stall any legislative solution to the issue.

== U.S. Federal Trade Commission ==
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the US government organization with authority to regulate the hotel industry. On the subject of resort fees, FTC attorney Mamie Kresses said "The fees are not illegal as long as they're disclosed."&lt;ref name="cbsnews" /&gt; What constitutes a clear disclosure, however, has been a matter of debate between the hotel industry and consumers. In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission advised 22 hotel operators that their online rate quote totals, which did not include certain fees, may need to be updated to comply with FTC regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hunter|first=Marnie|title=FTC warns hotels about 'resort fees'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/28/travel/hotels-resort-fees-warning/index.html|date=28 November 2012|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then the FTC has taken no legal action on resort fees. Consumer advocate Chris Elliott wrote "The FTC has failed to protect consumers from what is perhaps the most dishonest fee in the travel industry."&lt;ref name="ftc-2012" /&gt; In 2016, FTC Chairperson Ramirez wrote a letter to Congress on the subject of resort fees and said “in my view……the most efficient and effective means to mandate the type of industry-wide requirement you propose would be through legislation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Martin|first=Hugo|date=2016-01-10|title=FTC chairwoman calls for legislation to tackle hidden resort fees|website=Los Angeles Times|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-legislation-hidden-resort-fees-20160108-story.html|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; US Senator McCaskill introduced the “Truth in Hotel Advertising Act of 2016” in the US Senate on February 25, 2016.&lt;ref name="usa-today"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/roadwarriorvoices/2016/02/25/sen-mccaskill-introduces-bill-against-hidden-resort-fees/80935922/|title=Sen.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published a report on the harm of resort fees on January 5, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wood|first1=Donald|title='Hidden' hotel resort fees come under fire in FTC report|url=http://www.foxnews.com/travel/2017/01/06/hidden-hotel-resort-fees-come-under-fire-in-ftc-report.html|accessdate=February 14, 2017|date=January 6, 2017|website=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report concluded "that consumers are likely being harmed by the hotel industry practice of disclosing mandatory resort fees separate from posted room rates, without first disclosing the total price."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=FTC Economic Issue Paper Examines the Impact of Disclosing Mandatory Hotel Resort Fees Separately From Room Rates|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/01/ftc-economic-issue-paper-examines-impact-disclosing-mandatory|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges to Resort Fees==

Due to the increasing use of resort fees at hotels, many consumers have begun to challenge them being applied to their hotel bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Elliott|first=Christopher|date=2010-05-24|title=Yes, you can fight a resort fee - and win|url=http://elliott.org/blog/yes-you-can-fight-a-resort-fee-and-win/|website=Elliott|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been done by asking the hotel desk manager to remove the fee, by disputing the fee with the guest's credit card company or by suing the hotel in small claims court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://killresortfees.com/dontpay|title=DON'T PAY|website=Kill Resort Fees|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumer travel advocate Christopher Elliott advises anyone who was blindsided by an add-on fee to dispute the charge with their credit card company. While the booking sites may allow small-print disclosures, some credit card companies have taken the consumer's side in these disputes and reversed the charges. Moreover, merchants that have a high volume of disputed charges can run afoul of credit card providers, which in egregious cases have the ability to terminate a vendor's right to accept credit cards.&lt;ref name="cbsnews" /&gt;

Kill Resort Fees, an advocacy group working to eliminate resort fees, stated that all resort fees should be challenged. Lauren Wolfe, Founder of Kill Resort Fees, said that "Resort fees are the equivalent of being charged a second room rate. No law exists protecting hotels ability to charge two room rates for one night so all of these second rates also known as resort fees should be challenged by consumers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://killresortfees.com/blog|title=BLOG|website=Kill Resort Fees|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rosagasario es de Centragasal.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A soccer-related example of ''rosarigasino'' in a graffiti.]]

'''Rosarigasino''' (also known as '''Gasó''') is a [[language game]] (in the form of a [[rhyme|rhyming]] [[slang]]) traditionally associated with the city of [[Rosario]], {{Province|Santa Fe|Argentina}}, even though very few people, if any, currently employ it.

It is similar to the much more common game of ''[[jeringonza]]''. The exact origins of this language remain uncertain, but scholars and historians agree that it was created in early 20th century by local prisoners to communicate with each other without being understood by guards.

''Rosarigasino'' functions by adding two [[syllable]]s to each word by inserting the sequence ''-gas-'' immediately after the [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]ed vowel and then repeating that vowel, followed by the rest of the word. The term ''rosarigasino'' itself is formed in this way, after the local residents' [[demonym]] (''rosarino''). Other examples (with the added sounds in '''bold'''):

:''colectivo'' ("bus") &amp;rarr; ''colecti'''gasi'''vo''
:''[[National Flag Memorial (Argentina)|Monumento a la Bandera]]'' ("Flag Memorial") &amp;rarr; ''Monume'''gase'''nto a la Bande'''gase'''ra''
:''peatonal'' ("pedestrian street") &amp;rarr; ''peatona'''gasa'''l''
:''[[Córdoba Street (Rosario)|Calle Córdoba]]'' ("Córdoba St.") &amp;rarr; ''Ca'''gasa'''lle Co'''gasó'''rdoba''

In the city of Rosario there is a sort of ''Academia'' or ''Association of Gasó''. Besides, in some places it is possible to purchase manuals or learning books. In 2005, a complete rosarigasino version of [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes']] novel [[Don Quixote de la Mancha]] was published, entitled ''Don Quijogasote de la Magasancha'' and translated by [[Chiquito Reyes|Bernardo "Chiquito" Reyes]].

'''S. Wajed Ali''' ({{lang-bn|এস ওয়াজেদ আলী}}; 4 September 1890 – 10 June 1951) was a Bengali writer, nationalist and Barrister-at-Law.

== Early life ==

Wajid Ali was born on 4 September 1890 in the village of [[Baratajpur]] of [[Hooghly District|Hooghly]] district. S. Wajed Ali's maternal grandmother hailed from the [[Nawabpur]] village in Chanditola of [[Hooghly District|Hooghly]] district. Her father, who came from Mungaer, had settled in [[Nawabpur]] with a 'Jaigir' and married into the local Bengali community. Wajed Ali's three maternal uncles were 'Hafiz' in Koran and his grandfather's home atmosphere was one of religious conservatism. However, the natural beauty of [[Nawabpur]] touched him deeply as expressed in his memoirs. Wajed Ali's education began in the village '[[Madrasa]]' or school. At this stage, in 1897 he had his first marriage, at the early age of seven, with his six-month-old cousin Ayesha (the daughter of his paternal uncle Sheikh Golam Rahman). In 1898, at the age of eight, Wajed Ali came to Shillong and started education under the tutelage of his father, S. Belayet Ali. Later, he was admitted to the English medium Mokhar School in Shillong, from where he graduated in his 'Entrance Exams' with a gold medal. This phase of his life in Shillong, Meghalaya had a lasting impression upon him.

He went to [[Aligarh]] [[Aligarh Muslim University|MAYO college]], where he was recognised as a meritorious student. He subsequently passed his I.A. and B.A. exams from [[Allahabad]] University in 1908 and 1910 respectively. After his graduation from [[Allahabad]], he returned to his village of [[Baratajpur]] and spent a happy family life amidst the rural idyllic surroundings. His first child, Lutfunnissa, was born at this time. He was trying hard to convince his family to allow him to go to England for further education. Finally, with the enthusiasm and recommendations of his second uncle, he succeeded in getting their permission and left for London just a couple of years before the start of World War I. Wajed Ali joined the Law school of the [[University of Cambridge]], from where he attained his B.A. and Barrister-at-Law degrees.

== Career ==

=== The beginnings ===
While in [[Cambridge]], he had fallen seriously ill and Miss Eleanor Saxby of [[Bristol]] had come forward to take care of him, and enable his subsequent recovery. From this episode started a relationship between them which culminated in his second marriage and divorce from Ayesha Begum, at the obvious displeasure of his family members back home. The year was 1915 – [[World War I]] was raging in Europe. It was at this time that S.Wajed Ali started the practice of Law in [[Calcutta High Court]] and continued till 1922. All this while, he lived with Eleanor in Mott Lane, Ripon Lane, Ripon Street etc. in Calcutta. Ill fortune struck when various factors of the failure of the family business, failing health, extravagant lifestyle – all combined together to drive him to bankruptcy. He immersed himself in deep studies about the contemporary society and involved himself in the elite literary world of the time. At the advice of his friend, [[Pramatha Chowdhury]] (editor of weekly Shobuj Potro), he started writing in Bengali and began an extraordinary literary career.

=== 1923 – 1928 ===

In 1923, he was appointed the third presidency magistrate of Calcutta and a few days later he started living with his family in No. 1 Canal Road in [[Calcutta]]. At this period he devoted himself to his literary pursuits. He expressed himself with supreme creative excellence in the fields of prose, symbolism, story-writing, translation, travelogues, etc. His troubled marriage with Mrs. Eleanor Saxby (Nellie) came to an end in 1928, when the mother of his two sons, Ahmed and Abdullah and daughter [[Zaib-un-Nissa Hamidullah|Zeb-un-Nissa]] separated from him and married his younger brother S. Shamsher Ali. This turn of events drove him into a family crisis and utter loneliness. The dramatic family complications made him hurt susceptible and psychologically isolated. In the face of all these adversities, he maintained his literary stability and creativity in matters of philosophical and nationalistic pursuits. He always maintained his clarity of vision and focus in all these matters, which were close to his heart.

=== 1929 – 1944 ===

Having been cast into loneliness and isolation in his family life, S. Wajed Ali, amidst his otherwise busy life with the duties of his job, literary pursuits, chairmanships of various societies and organisations etc., was like a prisoner of pain on a lonely island. At this time he met a learned [[Bamar|Burmese]] lady, who subsequently became his wife and life-partner, Mrs. Badrunnessa Ali. Descended from the line of Chengiz Khan, her father was the head of a Burmese royal family. When the British forces attacked [[Burma]], most of the royal family men folk were killed in the anti-British struggle. Along with her mother and aunt, the Burmese princess Badrunnessa was brought to [[Calcutta]] as a royal war-prisoner. Unfortunately, a grave tragedy befell Mr. S. Wajed Ali's life only two years after his marriage, when on 26 October 1931, Mrs. Badrunnessa Ali died a day after the birth of her only child. Her body was buried in the 'Gobra graveyard'. An English nurse was appointed to take care of his new-born child, Sheikh Badruddin Ali (Zaib-un-Nissa was also quite young at the time).

The founding of the magazine 'Gulistan' in December 1932 was an active and busy chapter of S. Wajed Ali's life. He built up around this magazine a cultural and literary circle embracing the cream of contemporary Bengali society. Its cover bore the vision behind its creation 'the pioneer of Hindu-Muslim unity'. The writer's list of 'Gulistan' bears evidence of the nobility, width of scope and seriousness of the magazine: Kazi Nazrul Islam, Dr. Mohammed Shahidullah, Kazi Abdul Wadud, Kedārnāth Chattopādhyāy, Tārāśankar Bandyopādhyāy, Pramathanāth Bishi, Buddhadeb Basu, Sajanikānta Dās (of '''Śanibārer Chithi''' fame), Kaviśekhar Kālidās Rāy, Bārindranāth Ghosh, Pabitra Gangopādhyāy, Poet Kader Nawaz, Poet Nirmal Dās, Anurupā Devī, Prabhābatī Devī Sarasvatī, Indirā Devīcaudhurāni, Manilāl Bannerjee, A. K. Jainal Abedin (Navayug), Humayun Kabir, Comrade Abdul Aziz, Phanindranāth Mukhopādhyāy, Dhīrāj Bhattacārya, Saurīndramohan Mukhopadhyāy, Abbasuddin Ahmed etc. At these heady times, S. Wajed Ali's residence at 48, Jhowtalla Road, was the usual venue for the Gulistan-centred literary evening gatherings. The contemporary elite of the intellectual, literary and art world of Calcutta were often present in those sessions. Besides being the founder of the 'Gulistan' magazine, S. Wajed Ali was also the publisher and editor of the English language magazine: 'Bulletin of the Indian Rationalistic Society'.

=== Retirement ===

On 31 October 1945, S. Wajed Ali retired from the position of third presidency magistrate and restarted his independent legal profession. At this time he still resided at his residence at 48, Jhowtolla Road.

S. Wajed Ali was a soft-spoken person with a reserved and contemplative nature. He was a unique and distinctive personality of his time with his aristocratic bearing, wide grasp of knowledge and intellectual pursuits. Regarding his personality Syed Ali Ahsan has justifiably commented: "S. Wajed Ali possessed an exceptionally generous nature. With such a magnanimous, righteous, broad-minded and pleasing personality, he was well loved by all he came into contact with…' 'He had an extraordinary depth of perception'. While never loud nor offensive, he was amusing and extremely well informed in his discussions. He loved talking to children and often listened to their stories, keeping them amused with his special simple magical simplicity and charm. He had some unique pursuits: he loved to walk the streets and parks in [[Calcutta]] so much so that he is quoted as having said that ' I am ready to deny myself many things in my life, but I am not ready to give up my pleasure of walking….. I usually like to walk in the Maidan.'. Towards the middle of 1949, S. Wajed Ali was affected with 'cerebral thrombosis', which rendered one side of his body paralysed. He was treated by the German doctor Mr. Troy and cared for by nurses. In these difficult days, his sons looked after him regularly. His younger brother Mr. S. Shamsher Ali visited him every day. His first wife Ayesha Khatun often visited him. Finally, at 9 o' clock of Sunday, 10 June 1951, he died at his 48, Jhowtolla residence. He was buried beside the grave of his last wife Mrs. Badrunnessa Ali at Gobra graveyard in [[Calcutta]], where he had bought the place for himself when she died in 1931, 20 years earlier. Bounded by marble railings, his tombstone bears dates of his birth and death. He is honoured every year in a festival at his birthplace of Baratajpur.

'''Septate''' is a [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] term defined in biology in two different instances:

*In human biology, it is used to describe a divide. For example, a septate uterus would be a divided uterus.
*In [[mycology]], it is used to describe the condition of [[spore]]s or [[hyphae]] that possess or lack a [[septum|septa]] to divide cells.

{{IPA notice}}
The '''phonology of [[Standard German]]''' is the standard pronunciation or accent of the [[German language]]. It deals with current [[phonology]] and [[phonetics]] as well as with [[History of German|historical developments]] thereof as well as the geographical variants and the influence of [[German dialects]].

While the spelling of German is officially standardised by an international organisation (the [[Council for German Orthography]]) the pronunciation has no official standard and relies on a ''de facto'' standard documented in reference works such as {{lang|de|Deutsches Aussprachewörterbuch}} (German Pronunciation Dictionary) by Eva-Maria Krech et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Pages 1-2 of the book ({{lang|de|Deutsches Aussprachewörterbuch}}) discuss {{lang|de|die Standardaussprache, die Gegenstand dieses Wörterbuches ist}} (the standard pronunciation which is the topic of this dictionary). It also mentions {{lang|de|Da sich das Deutsche zu einer plurizentrischen Sprache entwickelt hat, bildeten sich jeweils eigene Standardvarietäten (und damit Standardaussprachen)}} (German has developed into a pluricentric language separate standard varieties (and hence standard pronunciations)), but refers to these standards as {{lang|de|regionale und soziolektale Varianten}} (regional and sociolectal variants).&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|de|[[Duden]] 6 Das Aussprachewörterbuch}} (Duden volume 6, The Pronunciation Dictionary) by [[Max Mangold]] and the training materials of radio and television stations such as ''[[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]]'', ''[[Deutschlandfunk]]'', or ''[[Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen]]''. This standardised pronunciation was invented, rather than coming from any particular German-speaking city, but the city that Germans most consider to be closest to the standard is [[Hanover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angeblich sprechen die Hannoveraner das reinste - sprich dialektfreieste - Deutsch und kommen dem Hochdeutschen am nächsten. Stimmt's?|url=https://www.zeit.de/stimmts/2000/200024_stimmts_hannover|quote=Stimmt.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reflections on Diglossia |url=http://faculty.ce.berkeley.edu/coby/essays/refdigl.htm|quote=In northern Germany, it appears that in Hanover – perhaps because of the presence of the electoral (later royal) court – a parastandard High German was spoken by the 18th century as well, at least among the educated, with the curious result that Hanover speech – though non-native – became the model of German pronunciation on the stage (Bühnendeutsch), since everywhere else in Germany dialects were still spoken by everyone. Other capitals (Berlin, Dresden, Munich, Vienna) eventually developed their own Umgangssprachen, but the Hanover model remained the ideal.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reading Heinrich Heine |url=https://the-eye.eu/public/WorldTracker.org/College%20Books/Cambridge%20University%20Press/0521863996.Cambridge.University.Press.Reading.Heinrich.Heine.Apr.2007.pdf|quote=He spoke the dialect of Hanover, where – as also in the vicinity to the south of this city – German is pronounced best.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicht das beste Hochdeutsch in Hannover|url=http://www.haz.de/Nachrichten/Kultur/Uebersicht/Nicht-das-beste-Hochdeutsch-in-Hannover|quote=In Hannover wird zweifellos ein Deutsch gesprochen, das sehr nah an der nationalen Aussprachenorm liegt. Aber das gilt auch für andere norddeutsche Städte wie Kiel, Münster oder Rostock. Hannover hat da keine Sonderstellung.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Standard German is sometimes referred to as {{lang|de|[[Bühnendeutsch]]}} (stage German), but the latter has its own definition and is slightly different.&lt;ref&gt;Differences include the pronunciation of the endings {{lang|de|-er}}, {{lang|de|-en}}, and {{lang|de|-em}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars&lt;ref name="wiese1617"&gt;See the discussion in {{Harvcoltxt|Wiese|1996|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; treat {{IPA|/ə/}} as an unstressed allophone of {{IPA|/ɛ/}}. Likewise, some scholars&lt;ref name="wiese1617"/&gt; treat {{IPA|/ɐ/}} as an allophone of the unstressed sequence {{IPA|/ər/}}. The phonemic status of {{IPA|/ɛː/}} is also debated - see below.

====Notes====
* Close vowels
** {{IPA|/iː/}} is close front unrounded {{IPAblink|iː}}.&lt;ref name="Mangold37"&gt;See the vowel charts in {{Harvcoltxt|Mangold|2005|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler87"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kohler|1999|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lodge87"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lodge|2009|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** {{IPA|/yː/}} is close near-front rounded {{IPAblink|y|y̠ː}}.&lt;ref name="Mangold37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lodge87"/&gt;
** {{IPA|/uː/}} is close back rounded {{IPAblink|uː}}.&lt;ref name="Mangold37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lodge87"/&gt;
** {{IPA|/ɪ/}} has been variously described as near-close front unrounded {{IPAblink|ɪ|ɪ̟}}&lt;ref name="Lodge87"/&gt; and near-close near-front unrounded {{IPAblink|ɪ}}.&lt;ref name="Mangold37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler87"/&gt;
** {{IPA|/ʏ/}} is near-close near-front rounded {{IPAblink|ʏ}}.&lt;ref name="Mangold37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lodge87"/&gt;
** {{IPA|/ʊ/}} is near-close near-back rounded {{IPAblink|ʊ}}.&lt;ref name="Mangold37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lodge87"/&gt;
* Mid vowels
** {{IPA|/eː/}} is close-mid front unrounded {{IPAblink|eː}}.&lt;ref name="Mangold37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lodge87"/&gt;
*** In non-standard accents of the Low German speaking area, as well as in some Bavarian and Austrian accents it may be pronounced as a narrow closing diphthong {{IPA|[eɪ]}}.
** {{IPA|/øː/}} has been variously described as close-mid near-front rounded {{IPAblink|ø|ø̠ː}}&lt;ref name="Kohler87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lodge87"/&gt; and mid near-front rounded {{IPAblink|ø̞|ø̽ː}}.&lt;ref name="Mangold37"/&gt;
*** In non-standard accents of the Low German speaking area, as well as in some Austrian accents it may be pronounced as a narrow closing diphthong {{IPA|[øʏ]}}.
** {{IPA|/oː/}} is close-mid back rounded {{IPAblink|oː}}.&lt;ref name="Mangold37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lodge87"/&gt;
*** In non-standard accents of the Low German speaking area, as well as in some Austrian accents it may be pronounced as a narrow closing diphthong {{IPA|[oʊ]}}.
** {{IPA|/ə/}} has been variously described as mid central unrounded {{IPAblink|ə}}.&lt;ref name="Mangold37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lodge87"/&gt; and  close-mid central unrounded {{IPAblink|ɘ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Wells's phonetic blog: {{IPA|ɘ}}|url=http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.com/2009/06/blog-post.html|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs only in unstressed syllables, for instance in {{lang|de|b'''e'''setz'''e'''n}} {{IPA|[bəˈzɛt͡sən]}} ('occupy'). It is often considered a complementary allophone together with {{IPAblink|ɛ}}, but which cannot occur in unstressed syllables. If a [[sonorant]] follows in the [[syllable coda]], the schwa often disappears so that the sonorant becomes syllabic, for instance {{lang|de|Kiss'''en'''}} {{IPA|[ˈkɪsn̩]}} ('pillow'), {{lang|de|Es'''el'''}} {{IPA|[ˈʔeːzl̩]}} ('donkey').
** {{IPA|/ɛ/}} has been variously described as mid near-front unrounded {{IPAblink|ɛ̝|ɛ̽}}&lt;ref name="Kohler87"/&gt; and open-mid front unrounded {{IPAblink|ɛ}}.&lt;ref name="Mangold37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lodge87"/&gt;
** {{IPA|/ɛː/}} has been variously described as mid front unrounded {{IPAblink|ɛ̝|ɛ̝ː}}&lt;ref name="Mangold37"/&gt; and open-mid front unrounded {{IPAblink|ɛː}}.&lt;ref name="Mangold37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler87"/&gt;
** {{IPA|/œ/}} has been variously described as open-mid near-front rounded {{IPAblink|œ|œ̠}}&lt;ref name="Lodge87"/&gt; and somewhat lowered open-mid near-front rounded {{IPAblink|œ|œ̠˕}}.&lt;ref name="Mangold37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler87"/&gt;
** {{IPA|/ɔ/}} has been variously described as somewhat fronted open-mid back rounded {{IPAblink|ɔ|ɔ̟}}&lt;ref name="Kohler87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lodge87"/&gt; and open-mid back rounded {{IPAblink|ɔ}}.&lt;ref name="Mangold37"/&gt;
* Open vowels
** {{IPA|/ɐ/}} is near-open central unrounded {{IPAblink|ɐ}}.&lt;ref name="Mangold37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler88"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kohler|1999|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a common allophone of the sequence {{IPA|/ər/}} common to all German-speaking areas but Switzerland.
** {{IPA|/a/}} has been variously described as open front unrounded {{IPAblink|a}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wierzbicka|Rynkowska|1992|p=413}}&lt;/ref&gt; and open central unrounded {{IPAblink|ä}}.&lt;ref name="Mangold37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lodge87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiese8"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wiese|1996|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krechetal24"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Krech|Stock|Hirschfeld|Anders|2009|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Wierzbicka|Rynkowska|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; differentiate two short {{IPA|/a/}}, namely front {{IPA|/a/}} and back {{IPA|/ɑ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wierzbicka|Rynkowska|1992|p=412}}. Note that authors state that {{IPA|/ɑ/}} can be realized as Polish {{IPA|/a/}}, i.e. central {{IPA|[ä]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter occurs only in unstressed open syllables, exactly as {{IPA|/i, y, u, e, ø, o/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wierzbicka|Rynkowska|1992|pp=412–415}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Standard Austrian pronunciation of this vowel is back {{IPAblink|ɑ}}.&lt;ref name="moosjipa342344"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Moosmüller|Schmid|Brandstätter|2015|pp=342–344}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Front {{IPAblink|a}} or even {{IPAblink|æ}} is a common realization of {{IPA|/a/}} in northern German varieties influenced by [[Low German]].
** {{IPA|/aː/}} has been variously described as open central unrounded {{IPAblink|äː}}&lt;ref name="Mangold37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lodge87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiese8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krechetal24"/&gt; and open back unrounded {{IPAblink|ɑː}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wierzbicka|Rynkowska|1992|p=412}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, it is sometimes transcribed {{IPA|/ɑː/}}.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. by {{Harvcoltxt|Lodge|2009|pp=86–89}} (without length marks, i.e. as {{IPA|/ɑ/}} - note that the vowel chart on page 87 places {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/ɑ/}} in the same open central position {{IPA|[ä]}}!), {{Harvcoltxt|Morciniec|Prędota|2005}} (without length marks, i.e. as {{IPA|/ɑ/}}) and {{Harvcoltxt|Wierzbicka|Rynkowska|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Back {{IPAblink|ɑː}} is the Standard Austrian pronunciation.&lt;ref name="moosjipa342344"/&gt; It is also a common realization of {{IPA|/aː/}} in northern German varieties influenced by [[Low German]] (in which it may even be rounded {{IPAblink|ɒː}}).
** {{Harvcoltxt|Wiese|1996}} notes that "there is a tendency to neutralize the distinction between {{IPA|[a(ː)]}}, {{IPA|[aɐ̯]}}, and {{IPA|[ɐ]}}. That is, {{lang|de|Oda}}, {{lang|de|Radar}}, and {{lang|de|Oder}} have final syllables which are perceptually very similar, and are nearly or completely identical in some dialects."&lt;ref name="Wiese254"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wiese|1996|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also says that "outside of a word context, {{IPA|[ɐ]}} cannot be distinguished from {{IPA|[a]}}.&lt;ref name="Wiese254"/&gt; (As early as 1847, [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s librettist found it natural, when [[I masnadieri|adapting]] [[Die Räuber|a play]] by Schiller into the Italian language, to render the distinctly German name ''Roller'' as ''Rolla''.)

Although there is also a [[Vowel length|length contrast]], vowels are often analyzed according to a [[tenseness]] contrast, with long {{IPA|/iː, yː, uː, eː, øː, oː/}} being the tense vowels and short {{IPA|/ɪ, ʏ, ʊ, ɛ, œ, ɔ/}} their lax counterparts. Like the English [[checked vowel]]s, the German lax vowels require a following consonant, with the notable exception of {{IPA|[ɛː]}} (which is absent in many varieties, as discussed below). {{IPA|/a/}} is sometimes considered the lax counterpart of tense {{IPA|/aː/}} in order to maintain this tense/lax division. Short {{IPA|/i, y, u, e, ø, o/}} occur in unstressed syllables of [[loanwords]], for instance in {{lang|de|Ps'''y'''ch'''o'''m'''e'''trie}} {{IPA|/psyçomeˈtʁiː/}} ('psychometry'). They are usually considered [[allophone]]s of tense vowels, which cannot occur in unstressed syllables (unless in compounds).

Northern German varieties influenced by Low German could be analyzed as lacking contrasting vowel quantity entirely:
* {{IPA|/aː/}} has a different quality than {{IPA|/a/}} (see above).
* These varieties also consistently lack {{IPA|/ɛː/}}, and use only {{IPA|/eː/}} in its place.

====Phonemic status of {{IPA|/ɛː/}}====
The long [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPAblink|ɛː}} does not exist in many varieties of Standard German and is rendered as the [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPAblink|eː}}, so that both '''{{lang|de|Äh'''re}} ('ear of grain') and '''{{lang|de|Eh'''re}} ('honor') are pronounced {{IPA|[ˈʔeːʁə]}} (instead of "Ähre" being {{IPA|[ˈʔɛːʁə]}}) and both {{lang|de|B'''ä'''ren}} ('bears') and {{lang|de|B'''ee'''ren}} ('berries') are pronounced {{IPA|[ˈbeːʁən]}} (instead of {{lang|de|Bären}} being {{IPA|[ˈbɛːʁən]}}). It is debated whether {{IPAblink|ɛː}} is a distinct phoneme or even exists, except when consciously self-censoring speech,&lt;ref name="bären=beeren"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|von Polenz|2000|pp=151, 175}}&lt;/ref&gt; for several reasons:
# The existence of a phoneme {{IPAslink|ɛː}} is an irregularity in a vowel system that otherwise has pairs of long and tense vs. short and lax vowels such as {{IPAblink|oː}} vs. {{IPAblink|ɔ}}.
# Although some dialects (e.g. [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] and some [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] dialects) have an opposition of {{IPAblink|eː}} vs. {{IPAblink|ɛː}}, there is little agreement across dialects as to whether individual lexical items should be pronounced with {{IPAblink|eː}} or with {{IPAblink|ɛː}}.{{examples needed|date=July 2017}}
# The use of {{IPAblink|ɛː}} is a [[spelling pronunciation]] rather than an original feature of the language.&lt;ref name="bären=beeren"/&gt; It is an attempt to "speak as is printed" ({{lang|de|sprechen wie gedruckt}}) and to differentiate the spellings {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|ä}} (speakers of the language attempt to justify the appearance of {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|ä}} in writing by making them distinct in the spoken language).
# Speakers with an otherwise fairly standard [[idiolect]] find it rather difficult to utter longer passages with {{IPAblink|eː}} and {{IPAblink|ɛː}} in the right places. Such persons apparently have to picture the spellings of the words in question, which impedes the flow of speech.&lt;ref name="bären=beeren"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=October 2015}}&lt;!--Source is indirectly support; it would be nice to have a more direct statement--&gt;

* {{IPA|/aɪ̯/}} has been variously described as {{IPA|[äɪ]}},&lt;ref name="Mangold37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WieseDiph"&gt;Source: {{Harvcoltxt|Wiese|1996|pp=11, 14}}. On the page 14, the author states that {{IPA|/aɪ̯/}}, {{IPA|/aʊ̯/}} and {{IPA|/ɔʏ̯/}} are of the same quality as vowels of which they consist. On the page 8, he states that {{IPA|/a/}} is low central.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|[äe̠]}}&lt;ref name="Kohler87D"&gt;See vowel chart in {{Harvcoltxt|Kohler|1999|p=87}}. Note that despite their true ending points, Kohler still transcribes them as {{IPA|/aɪ̯ aʊ̯ ɔɪ̯/}}, i.e. with higher offsets than those actually have.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{IPA|[aɛ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Source: {{Harvcoltxt|Krech|Stock|Hirschfeld|Anders|2009|p=72}}. Authors do not provide a vowel chart. Rather, they state rather vaguely that "the diphthong {{IPA|[aɛ̯]}} is a monosyllabic compound consisting of the unrounded open vowel {{IPA|[a]}} and the unrounded mid front vowel {{IPA|[ɛ]}}."&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/aʊ̯/}} has been variously described as {{IPA|[äʊ]}},&lt;ref name="WieseDiph"/&gt; {{IPA|[äʊ̞]}},&lt;ref name="Mangold37"/&gt; {{IPA|[äo̟]}}&lt;ref name="Kohler87D"/&gt; and {{IPA|[aɔ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Source: {{Harvcoltxt|Krech|Stock|Hirschfeld|Anders|2009|pp=72–73}}. Authors do not provide a vowel chart. Rather, they state rather vaguely that "the diphthong {{IPA|[aɔ̯]}} is a monosyllabic compound consisting of the unrounded open vowel {{IPA|[a]}} and the rounded mid back vowel {{IPA|[ɔ]}}."&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/ɔʏ̯/}} has been variously described as {{IPA|[ɔʏ]}},&lt;ref name="WieseDiph"/&gt; {{IPA|[ɔʏ̞]}},&lt;ref name="Mangold37"/&gt; {{IPA|[ɔ̝e̠]}}&lt;ref name="Kohler87D"/&gt; and {{IPA|[ɔœ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Krech|Stock|Hirschfeld|Anders|2009|p=73}}. Authors do not provide a vowel chart. Rather, they state rather vaguely that "the diphthong {{IPA|[ɔœ̯]}} is a monosyllabic compound consisting of the rounded mid back vowel {{IPA|[ɔ]}} and the rounded mid front vowel {{IPA|[œ]}}."&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of [[Smoothing (phonetics)|smoothing]] is absent from standard German, so the sequences {{IPA|/aɪ̯ə, aʊ̯ə, ɔʏ̯ə/}} are never pronounced *{{IPA|[aə̯, aə̯, ɔə̯]}} or *{{IPA|[aː, aː, ɔː]}}.

====Phonetic====
Marginally, there are other diphthongs, for instance
* {{IPA|[ʊɪ̯]}} in [[interjection]]s such as {{lang|de|pf'''ui'''}} {{IPA|[p͡fʊɪ̯]}},

The following usually are not counted among the German diphthongs as German speakers often feel they are distinct marks of "foreign words" ({{lang|de|Fremdwörter}}). These appear only in loanwords:
* {{IPA|[o̯a]}}, as in {{lang|de|Cr'''oi'''ssant}} {{IPA|[kʁ̥o̯aˈsɑ̃]}}, colloquially: {{IPA|[kʁ̥o̯aˈsaŋ]}}.
* Many German speakers use {{IPA|[ɛɪ̯]}} and {{IPA|[ɔʊ̯]}} as adaptations of the English diphthongs {{IPAc-en|eɪ}} and {{IPAc-en|oʊ}} in English loanwords, according to {{Harvcoltxt|Wiese|1996}}, or they replace them with the native German long vowels {{IPA|/oː/}} and {{IPA|/eː/}}. Thus, the word {{lang|de|okay}} may be pronounced {{IPA|[ɔʊ̯ˈkɛɪ̯]}} or {{IPA|/oːˈkeː/}}.&lt;ref name="Wiese12"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wiese|1996|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, {{Harvcoltxt|Mangold|2005}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Krech|Stock|Hirschfeld|Anders|2009}} do not recognize these diphthongs as phonemes, and prescribe pronunciations with the long vowels {{IPA|/eː/}} and {{IPA|/oː/}} instead.

In the varieties where speakers vocalize {{IPA|/r/}} to {{IPAblink|ɐ}} in the syllable coda, a diphthong ending in {{IPA|[ɐ̯]}} may be formed with every vowel except {{IPA|/ə/}} and {{IPA|/ɐ/}}:

:{{note|1|1}}{{Harvcoltxt|Wiese|1996}} notes that the length contrast is not very stable before non-prevocalic {{IPA|/r/}}&lt;ref name="Wiese198"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wiese|1996|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "{{Harvcoltxt|Meinhold|Stock|1980|p=180}}, following the pronouncing dictionaries ({{Harvcoltxt|Mangold|1990}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Krech|Stötzer|1982}}) judge the vowel in {{lang|de|Art}}, {{lang|de|Schwert}}, {{lang|de|Fahrt}} to be long, while the vowel in {{lang|de|Ort}}, {{lang|de|Furcht}}, {{lang|de|hart}} is supposed to be short. The factual basis of this presumed distinction seems very questionable."&lt;ref name="Wiese198"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also supported by {{Harvcoltxt|Tröster-Mutz|2011|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on stating that in his own dialect, there is no length difference in these words, and that judgements on vowel length in front of non-prevocalic {{IPA|/r/}} which is itself vocalized are problematic, in particular if {{IPA|/a/}} precedes.&lt;ref name="Wiese198"/&gt;

:According to the "lengthless" analysis, the aforementioned "long" diphthongs are analyzed as {{IPA|[iɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[yɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[uɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[ɛɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[eɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[øɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[oɐ̯]}} and {{IPA|[aɐ̯]}}. This makes non-prevocalic {{IPA|/ar/}} and {{IPA|/aːr/}} homophonous as {{IPA|[aɐ̯]}} or {{IPA|[aː]}}. Non-prevocalic {{IPA|/ɛr/}} and {{IPA|/ɛːr/}} may also merge, but the vowel chart in {{Harvcoltxt|Kohler|1999}} shows that they have somewhat different starting points - [[mid-centralized]] open-mid front {{IPAblink|ɛ̝|ɛ̽}} for the former, open-mid front {{IPAblink|ɛ}} for the latter.&lt;ref name="Kohler88"/&gt;

:{{Harvcoltxt|Wiese|1996}} also states that "laxing of the vowel is predicted to take place in shortened vowels; it does indeed seem to go hand in hand with the vowel shortening in many cases."&lt;ref name="Wiese198"/&gt; This leads to {{IPA|[iɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[yɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[uɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[eɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[øɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[oɐ̯]}} being pronounced the same as {{IPA|[ɪɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[ʏɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[ʊɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[ɛɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[œɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[ɔɐ̯]}}. This merger is usual in the Standard Austrian accent, in which e.g. {{lang|de|Moor}} 'bog' is often pronounced {{IPA|[mɔɐ̯]}}; this, in contrast with the Standard Northern variety, also happens intervocalically, along with the diphthongization of the laxed vowel to {{IPA|[Vɐ̯]}}, so that e.g. {{lang|de|Lehrer}} 'teacher' is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈlɛɐ̯ʁɐ]}}&lt;ref name="moosjipa342"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Moosmüller|Schmid|Brandstätter|2015|p=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the corresponding Standard Northern pronunciation is {{IPA|[ˈleːʁɐ]}}). Another feature of the Standard Austrian accent is complete absorption of {{IPA|[ɐ̯]}} by the preceding {{IPA|/ɑ, ɑː/}}, so that e.g. {{lang|de|rar}} 'scarce' is pronounced {{IPA|[ʁɑː]}}.&lt;ref name="moosjipa342"/&gt;

==Consonants==
With approximately 25 phonemes, the German consonant system has an average number of consonants in comparison with other languages. One of the more noteworthy ones is the unusual [[affricate consonant#Non-sibilant affricates|affricate]] {{IPA|/p͡f/}}.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of the German consonants from a synchronic and diachronic point of view, see {{Harvcoltxt|Cercignani|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{IPA|/θ, ð/}} are used only in loanwords, mostly from English, such as {{lang|de|Thriller}} {{IPA|/ˈθʁɪlɐ/}},&lt;ref name="coronalsc"/&gt; though some speakers substitute {{IPA|/θ/}} with any of {{IPA|/t, s, f/}} and {{IPA|/ð/}} with any of {{IPA|/d, z, v/}}.

*** Distribution: Common in the south (Bavaria and many parts of Switzerland and Austria), but it is also found in some speakers in central and northern Germany, especially the elderly. It is also one of possible realizations of {{IPA|/r/}} in the Standard Austrian accent, but a more common alveolar realization is an approximant {{IPAblink|ɹ}}. Even more common are uvular realizations, fricatives {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ʁ}} ~ {{IPA link|χ}}]}} and a trill {{IPAblink|ʀ}}.&lt;ref name="moosjipa341342"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Moosmüller|Schmid|Brandstätter|2015|pp=341–342}}: "SAG features a wide variety of realizations of the trill. In approximately the past 40 years, the pronunciation norm has changed from an alveolar to a uvular trill. The latter is mostly pronounced as a fricative, either voiced or voiceless.

*** Distribution: Occurs in some conservative varieties - most speakers with a uvular {{IPA|/r/}} realize it as a fricative or an approximant.&lt;ref name="SOWL225"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of possible realizations of {{IPA|/r/}} in the Standard Austrian accent, but it is less common than a fricative {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ʁ}} ~ {{IPA link|χ}}]}}.&lt;ref name="moosjipa341342"/&gt;
** Dorsal continuant, about the quality of which there is not a complete agreement:
*** {{Harvcoltxt|Krech|Stock|Hirschfeld|Anders|2009}} describe two fricative variants, namely [[Voiced palatal fricative|post-palatal]] {{IPA|[ɣ˖]}} and [[Voiced velar fricative|velar]] {{IPA|[ɣ]}}.

**** {{Harvcoltxt|Mangold|2005}} states that "with educated professional radio and TV announcers, as with professional actors on the stage and in film, the [voiced uvular] fricative [realization of] {{IPA|/r/}} clearly predominates."&lt;ref name="coronalsd"/&gt;
***** In the Standard Austrian accent, the uvular fricative is also the most common realization, although its voicing is variable (that is, it can be either voiced {{IPAblink|ʁ}} or voiceless {{IPAblink|χ}}).&lt;ref name="moosjipa341342"/&gt;
**** {{Harvcoltxt|Kohler|1999}} writes that "the place of articulation of the consonant varies from uvular in e.g. {{lang|de|rot}} ('red') to velar in e.g. {{lang|de|treten}} ('kick'), depending on back or front vowel contexts." He also notes that {{IPAblink|ʁ}} is devoiced after voiceless plosives and fricatives, especially those within the same word, giving the word {{lang|de|treten}} as an example.

*** Distribution: Widespread, but less common in Switzerland.
*The voiceless stops {{IPAslink|p}}, {{IPAslink|t}}, {{IPAslink|k}} are [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] except when preceded by a [[sibilant]]. Many southern dialects do not aspirate {{IPA|/p t k/}}, and some northern ones do so only in a stressed position. The voiceless affricates {{IPA|/p͡f/}}, {{IPA|/t͡s/}}, and {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} are never aspirated,&lt;ref name="coronalse"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Mangold|2005|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; and neither are any other consonants besides the aforementioned {{IPA|/p, t, k/}}.&lt;ref name="coronalse"/&gt;
*The obstruents {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ, z, ʒ, dʒ/}} are voiceless lenis {{IPA|[b̥, d̥, ɡ̊, z̥, ʒ̊, d͜ʒ̊]}} in southern varieties, and they contrast with voiceless fortis {{IPA|[p, t, k, s, ʃ, t͡ʃ]}}.
*In Austria, [[intervocalic]] {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ/}} can be lenited to fricatives {{IPA|[{{IPA link|β}}, {{IPA link|ð}}, {{IPA link|ɣ}}]}}.&lt;ref name="moosjipa341"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Moosmüller|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Before and after front vowels ({{IPA|/ɪ, iː, ʏ, yː, ɛ, ɛː, eː, œ, øː/}} and, in varieties that realize them as front, {{IPA|/a/}} and/or {{IPA|/aː/}}), the velar consonants {{IPA|/ŋ, k, ɡ/}} are realized as post-palatal {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ŋ˖}}, {{IPA link|k̟}}, {{IPA link|ɡ˖}}]}}.&lt;ref name="wiese-velarpoa"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wiese|1996|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Krech|Stock|Hirschfeld|Anders|2009|pp=49, 92, 97}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to {{Harvcoltxt|Wiese|1996}}, in a parallel process, {{IPA|/k, ɡ/}} before and after back vowels ({{IPA|/ʊ, uː, ɔ, oː/}} and, in varieties that realize them as back, {{IPA|/a/}} and/or {{IPA|/aː/}}) are retracted to post-velar {{IPA|[{{IPA link|k̠}}, {{IPA link|ɡ˗}}]}} or even uvular {{IPA|[{{IPA link|q}}, {{IPA link|ɢ}}]}}.&lt;ref name="wiese-velarpoa"/&gt;
*There is no complete agreement about the nature of {{IPA|/j/}}; it has been variously described as a fricative {{IPAblink|ʝ}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Krech|Stock|Hirschfeld|Anders|2009|pp=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Morciniec|Prędota|2005|pp=77–78}}. The authors transcribe it {{IPA|/j/}}, i.e. as an approximant.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wiese|1996|p=12}}. The author transcribes it {{IPA|/j/}}, i.e. as an approximant.&lt;/ref&gt; a fricative, which can be fricated less strongly than {{IPA|/ç/}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Mangold|2005|p=51}}. The author transcribes it {{IPA|/j/}}, i.e. as an approximant.&lt;/ref&gt; a sound variable between a weak fricative an approximant&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hall|2003|p=48}}.

The authors transcribe it as {{IPA|/j/}}, i.e. as an approximant.&lt;/ref&gt; which is the usual realization in the Standard Austrian variety.&lt;ref name="moosjipa340"/&gt;
*In many varieties of standard German, {{IPAblink|ʔ}} occurs in careful speech before word stems that begin with a vowel. Some varieties of standard German do not have {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, e.g. [[Swiss Standard German]]. It is not usually considered a phoneme. In colloquial and dialectal speech, {{IPA|[ʔ]}} is often omitted, especially when the word beginning with a vowel is unstressed.
*The phonemic status of affricates is controversial. The majority view accepts {{IPAslink|p͡f}} and {{IPAslink|t͡s}}, but not {{IPAslink|t͡ʃ}} or the non-native {{IPAslink|d͡ʒ}}; some&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Kohler|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; accept none, some accept all but {{IPAslink|d͡ʒ}}, and some&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Wiese|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; accept all. {{IPAblink|d͡ʒ}} and {{IPAblink|ʒ}} occur only in words of foreign origin. In certain varieties, they are replaced by {{IPAblink|t͡ʃ}} and {{IPAblink|ʃ}} altogether.
*{{IPAblink|ʋ}} is occasionally considered to be an allophone of {{IPAslink|v}}, especially in southern varieties of German.
*{{IPAblink|ç}} and {{IPAblink|x}} are traditionally regarded as allophones after front vowels and back vowels, respectively. For a more detailed analysis see below at [[#Ich-Laut and ach-Laut|''ich-Laut'' and ''ach-Laut'']]. According to some analyses, {{IPAblink|χ}} is an allophone of {{IPAslink|x}} after {{IPA|/a, aː/}} and according to some also after {{IPA|/ʊ, ɔ, aʊ̯/}}.&lt;ref name="Kohler88"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moosjipa341"/&gt; However, according to {{Harvcoltxt|Moosmüller|Schmid|Brandstätter|2015}}, the uvular allophone is used after {{IPA|/ɔ/}} only in the Standard Austrian variety.&lt;ref name="moosjipa341"/&gt;
*Some phonologists{{Who|date=December 2010}} deny the phoneme {{IPAslink|ŋ}} and use {{IPA|/nɡ/}} instead along with {{IPA|/nk/}} instead of {{IPA|/ŋk/}}. The phoneme sequence {{IPA|/nɡ/}} is realized as {{IPA|[ŋɡ]}} when {{IPAslink|ɡ}} can start a valid onset of the next syllable whose nucleus is a vowel other than unstressed {{IPAslink|ə}}, {{IPAslink|ɪ}}, or {{IPAslink|ʊ}}. It becomes {{IPAblink|ŋ}} otherwise. For example:
**{{lang|de|Diphthong}} {{IPA|/ˈdɪftɔnɡ/ [ˈdɪftɔŋ]}}
**{{lang|de|diphthongieren}} {{IPA|/dɪftɔnˈɡiːʁən/ [ˌdɪftɔŋˈɡiːʁən]}}
**{{lang|de|Englisch}} {{IPA|/ˈɛnɡlɪʃ/ [ˈʔɛŋlɪʃ]}}
**{{lang|de|Anglo}} {{IPA|/ˈanɡloː/ [ˈʔaŋɡloː]}}
**{{lang|de|Ganges}} {{IPA|/ˈɡanɡəs/ [ˈɡaŋəs]}} ~ {{IPA|/ˈɡanɡɛs/ [ˈɡaŋɡɛs]}}

===''Ich-Laut'' and ''ach-Laut''===&lt;!-- the articles "Ich-Laut" and "Ach-Laut" redirect to this section heading--&gt;
'{{lang|de|Ich-Laut}}' is the [[voiceless palatal fricative]] {{IPAblink|ç}} (which is found in the word {{lang|de|ich}} {{IPA|[ʔɪç]}} 'I'), and '''{{lang|de|ach-Laut}}''' is the [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPAblink|x}} (which is found in the word {{lang|de|ach}} {{IPA|[ax]}} the interjection 'oh', 'alas'). Note that {{lang|de|Laut}} {{IPA|[laʊ̯t]}} is the German word for 'sound, [[phone (phonetics)|phone]]'. In German, these two sounds are [[allophone]]s occurring in [[complementary distribution]]. The allophone {{IPAblink|x}} occurs after back vowels and {{IPA|/a aː/}} (for instance in {{lang|de|Buch}} {{IPA|[buːx]}} 'book'), the allophone {{IPAblink|ç}} after front vowels (for instance in {{lang|de|mich}} {{IPA|[mɪç]}} 'me/myself') and consonants (for instance in {{lang|de|Furcht}} {{IPA|[fʊʁçt]}} 'fear', {{lang|de|manchmal}} {{IPA|[ˈmançmaːl]}} 'sometimes'). (This happens most regularly: if the {{angbr|r}} in {{lang|de|Furcht}} is pronounced as a consonant, {{lang|de|ch}} represents {{IPAblink|ç}}; however if, as often happens, it is vocalized as {{IPA|[ɐ]}}, resembling the vowel {{IPA|[a]}}, then {{angbr|ch}} may represent {{IPAblink|x}}, yielding {{IPA|[fʊɐ̯xt]}}.)

In [[loanword]]s, the pronunciation of potential [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] in [[Onset (linguistics)|onsets]] of [[stressed syllable]]s varies: in the Northern varieties of standard German, it is {{IPAblink|ç}}, while in Southern varieties, it is {{IPAblink|k}}, and in Western varieties, it is {{IPAblink|ʃ}} (for instance in {{lang|de|China}}: {{IPA|[ˈçiːna]}} vs. {{IPA|[ˈkiːna]}} vs. {{IPA|[ˈʃiːna]}}).

The [[diminutive]] [[suffix]] {{lang|de|-chen}} is always pronounced with an {{lang|de|ich-Laut}} {{IPA|[-çən]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wiese|1996|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, this ending triggers [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] (compare for instance {{lang|de|Hund}} {{IPA|[hʊnt]}} 'dog' to {{lang|de|Hündchen}} {{IPA|[ˈhʏntçn̩]}} 'little dog'), so theoretically, it could only occur after [[front vowel]]s. However, in some comparatively recent coinings, there is no longer an umlaut, for instance in the word {{lang|de|Frauchen}} {{IPA|[ˈfʀaʊ̯çən]}} (a diminutive of {{lang|de|Frau}} 'woman'), so that a back vowel is followed by a {{IPAblink|ç}}, even though normally it would be followed by a {{IPAblink|x}}, as in {{lang|de|rauchen}} {{IPA|[ˈʀaʊ̯xən]}} ('to smoke'). This exception to the allophonic distribution may be an effect of the morphemic boundary or an example of ''[[phonemic differentiation#Phonemic splits|phonemicization]]'', where erstwhile allophones undergo a split into separate [[phoneme]]s.

The allophonic distribution of {{IPAblink|ç}} after front vowels and {{IPAblink|x}} after other vowels is also found in other languages, such as [[Scots language|Scots]], in the pronunciation of ''light''. However, it is by no means inevitable: [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], and many Southern German dialects retain {{IPAblink|x}} (which can be realized as {{IPAblink|χ}} instead) in all positions. It is thus reasonable to assume that [[Old High German]] ''ih'', the ancestor of modern {{lang|de|ich}}, was pronounced with {{IPAblink|x}} rather than {{IPAblink|ç}}. While it is impossible to know for certain whether [[Old English language|Old English]] words such as ''niht'' (modern ''night'') were pronounced with {{IPAblink|x}} or {{IPAblink|ç}}, {{IPAblink|ç}} is likely (see [[Old English phonology#Consonant allophones|Old English phonology]]).

Despite the phonetic history, the complementary distribution of {{IPAblink|ç}} and {{IPAblink|x}} in modern [[Standard German]] is better described as backing of {{IPAslink|ç}} after a [[back vowel]], rather than fronting of {{IPAslink|x}} after a [[front vowel]], because {{IPAblink|ç}} is used in [[Syllable#Onset|onsets]] ({{lang|de|Chemie}} {{IPA|[çeˈmiː]}} 'chemistry') and after consonants ({{lang|de|Molch}} {{IPA|[mɔlç]}} 'newt'), and is thus the [[underlying form]] of the phoneme.

According to Kohler,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kohler|1977}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Kohler|1990}}, as cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Wiese|1996|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; the German {{lang|de|ach-Laut}} is further differentiated into two allophones, {{IPAblink|x}} and {{IPAblink|χ}}: {{IPAblink|x}} occurs after {{IPA|/uː, oː/}} (for instance in {{lang|de|Buch}} {{IPA|[buːx]}} 'book') and {{IPAblink|χ}} after {{IPA|/a, aː/}} (for instance in {{lang|de|Bach}} {{IPA|[baχ]}} 'brook'), while either {{IPAblink|x}} or {{IPAblink|χ}} may occur after {{IPA|/ʊ, ɔ, aʊ̯/}}, with {{IPAblink|χ}} predominating.

===Fortis–lenis pairs===
Various German consonants occur in pairs at the same [[place of articulation]] and in the same [[manner of articulation]], namely the pairs {{IPA|/p–b/}}, {{IPA|/t–d/}}, {{IPA|/k–ɡ/}}, {{IPA|/s–z/}}, {{IPA|/ʃ–ʒ/}}. These pairs are often called [[Fortis and lenis|fortis–lenis]] pairs, since describing them as voiced–voiceless pairs is inadequate. With certain qualifications, {{IPA|/t͡ʃ–d͡ʒ/}}, {{IPA|/f–v/}} and {{IPA|/θ–ð/}} are also considered fortis–lenis pairs.

Fortis-lenis distinction for {{IPA|/ʔ, m, n, ŋ, l, r, h/}} is unimportant.&lt;ref name=folemangold&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Mangold|2005|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fortis stops {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} are [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] in many varieties. The aspiration is strongest in the onset of a [[stressed syllable]] (such as {{lang|de|Taler}} {{IPA|[ˈtʰaːlɐ]}} 'thaler'), weaker in the [[Onset (linguistics)|onset]] of an [[unstressed syllable]] (such as {{lang|de|Vater}} {{IPA|[ˈfaːtʰɐ]}} 'father'), and weakest in the [[syllable coda]] (such as in {{lang|de|Saat}} {{IPA|[zaːtʰ]}} 'seed'). All fortis consonants, i.e. {{IPA|/p, t, k, f, θ, s, ʃ, ç, x, p͡f, t͡s, t͡ʃ/}}&lt;ref name=folemangold/&gt; are fully voiceless.&lt;ref name=vlessfortis&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Mangold|2005|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lenis consonants {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ, v, ð, z, ʒ, j, r, d͡ʒ/}}&lt;ref name=folemangold/&gt; range from being weakly voiced to almost voiceless {{IPA|[b̥, d̥, ɡ̊, v̥, ð̥, z̥, ʒ̊, j̥, r̥, d͜ʒ̊]}} after voiceless consonants:&lt;ref name=vlessfortis/&gt; {{lang|de|Kas'''b'''ah}} {{IPA|[ˈkasb̥a]}} ('kasbah)', {{lang|de|ab'''d'''anken}} {{IPA|[ˈʔapd̥aŋkn̩]}} ('to resign'), {{lang|de|rot'''g'''elb}} {{IPA|[ˈʁoːtɡ̊ɛlp]}} ('red-yellow'), {{lang|de|Ab'''w'''urf}} {{IPA|[ˈʔapv̥ʊʁf]}} ('dropping'), {{lang|de|Ab'''s'''icht}} {{IPA|[ˈʔapz̥ɪçt]}} ('intention'), {{lang|de|Holz'''j'''alousie}} {{IPA|[ˈhɔlt͜sʒ̊aluziː]}} ('wooden jalousie'), {{lang|de|weg'''j'''agen}} {{IPA|[ˈvɛkj̥aːɡn̩]}} ('to chase away'), {{lang|de|t'''r'''opfen}} {{IPA|[ˈtʁ̥ɔp͡fn̩]}} ('to drop'), {{lang|de|Obst'''j'''uice}} {{IPA|[ˈʔoːpstd͜ʒ̊uːs]}} ('fruit juice'). {{Harvcoltxt|Mangold|2005}} states that they are "to a large extent voiced" {{IPA|[b, d, g, v, ð, z, ʒ, j, r, d͡ʒ]}} in all other environments,&lt;ref name=folemangold/&gt; but some studies have found the stops {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ/}} to be voiceless word/utterance-initially in most dialects (while still contrasting with {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} due to the aspiration of the latter).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jessen|Ringen|2002|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA|/b, d, ɡ, z, ʒ/}} are [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] in most southern varieties of German. For clarity, they are often transcribed as {{IPA|[b̥, d̥, ɡ̊, z̥, ʒ̊]}}.

The nature of the phonetic difference between the voiceless lenis consonants and the similarly voiceless fortis consonants is controversial. It is generally described as a difference in articulatory force, and occasionally as a difference in articulatory length; for the most part, it is assumed that one of these characteristics implies the other.

In various central and southern varieties, the opposition between fortis and lenis is neutralized in the [[syllable onset]]; sometimes just in the onset of stressed syllables, sometimes in all cases.

The pair {{IPA|/f-v/}} is not considered a fortis–lenis pair, but a simple voiceless–voiced pair, as {{IPAslink|v}} remains [[voiced]] in all varieties, including the Southern varieties that [[Devoiced|devoice]] the lenes (with however some exceptions).&lt;ref&gt;{{clarify span|text=[v] written {{lang|de|v}}|explain=Mixing orthography with phonology; what's the phonological analysis here?|date=April 2013}} can devoice in nearly every place once the word has become common; {{lang|de|w}} is devoiced in {{lang|de|Möwe, Löwe}}. On the other hand, the keeping to the variety is so standard that {{lang|de|doof}} {{IPA|/do:f/}} induced the writing "(der) doofe" even though the standard pronunciation of the latter word is {{IPA|/ˈdoːvə/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the southern {{IPAslink|v}} is realized as the voiced [[approximant]] {{IPAblink|ʋ}}. However, there are southern varieties which differentiate between a fortis {{IPAslink|f}} (such as in {{lang|de|sträflich}} {{IPA|[ˈʃtrɛːflɪç]}} 'culpable' from [[Middle High German]] stræflich) and a lenis {{IPAslink|f}} ({{IPA|[v̥]}}, such as in {{lang|de|höflich}} {{IPA|[ˈhøːv̥lɪç]}} 'polite' from Middle High German hovelîch); this is analogous to the opposition of fortis {{IPAslink|s}} ({{IPAblink|s}}) and lenis {{IPA|[z̥]}}.

====Coda devoicing====
In varieties from Northern Germany, lenis stops in the [[syllable coda]] are realized as fortis stops. This does not happen in varieties from Southern Germany, Austria or Switzerland.{{refn|See {{harvtxt|Ammonn|Bickel|Ebner|Esterhammer|2004|page=LVII}}.}}

Since the lenis stops {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ/}} are unvoiced or at most variably voiced (as stated above), this cannot be called devoicing in the strict sense of the word because it does not involve the loss of [[Voice (phonetics)|phonetic voice]].&lt;ref name="uiowa.edu"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Beckman|Jessen|Ringen|2009|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; More accurately, it can be called coda [[fortition]] or a [[Phoneme#Neutralization, archiphoneme, and underspecification|neutralization]] of fortis and lenis sounds in the coda. Fricatives are truly and contrastively voiced in Northern Germany.{{refn|In Southern Germany, Austria or Switzerland there is no phonetic voice in fricatives either, see {{harvtxt|Ammonn|Bickel|Ebner|Esterhammer|2004|page=LVII}}.}} Therefore, the fricatives undergo [[Final-obstruent devoicing|coda devoicing]] in the strict sense of the word.&lt;ref name="uiowa.edu"/&gt; It is disputed whether coda devoicing is due to a constraint which specifically operates on syllable codas or whether it arises from constraints which "protect voicing in privileged positions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Beckman|Jessen|Ringen|2009|pp=264–265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As against standard pronunciation rules, in western varieties including those of the [[Rhineland]], coda fortis–lenis neutralization results in ''voicing'' rather than ''devoicing'' if the following word begins with a vowel. For example, {{lang|de|mit uns}} becomes {{IPA|[mɪ'''d'''‿ʊns]}} and {{lang|de|darf ich}} becomes {{IPA|[daʁ'''v'''‿ɪʃ]}}. The same [[sandhi]] phenomenon exists also as a general rule in the [[Luxembourgish]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infolux.uni.lu/phonetik/lautstruktur-des-luxemburgischen/wortuebergreifende-phaenomene/ |title=Lautstruktur des Luxemburgischen - Wortübergreifende Phänomene |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stress==
[[lexical stress|Stress]] in German usually falls on the first syllable, with the following exceptions:
* Many [[loanword]]s, especially proper names, keep their original stress. E.g. {{lang|de|Obama}} {{IPA|/oˈbaː.ma/}}
* Nouns formed with Latinate suffixes, such as {{lang|de|-ant, -anz, -enz, -ion, -ismus, -ist, -ment, -tät}}: {{lang|de|Idealismus}} {{IPA|/ide.aˈlɪsmʊs/}} ('idealism'), {{lang|de|Konsonant}} {{IPA|/kɔnzoˈnant/}} ('consonant'), {{lang|de|Tourist}} {{IPA|/tuˈʁɪst/}} ('tourist')
* Verbs formed with the French-derived suffix ''-ieren'', e.g. {{lang|de|studieren}} {{IPA|/ʃtuˈdiːʁən/}} ('to study'). This is often pronounced {{IPA|/iːɐ̯n/}} in casual speech.
* Compound adverbs with {{lang|de|her}}, {{lang|de|hin}}, {{lang|de|da}}, or {{lang|de|wo}} as they are stressed on the first syllable of the second element, e.g. {{lang|de|dagegen}} {{IPA|/daˈɡeːɡən/}} ('on the other hand'), {{lang|de|woher}} {{IPA|/voˈheːɐ̯/}} ('from where')
In addition, German uses different stress for separable [[prefix]]es and inseparable prefixes in verbs and words derived from such verbs:
* Words beginning with {{lang|de|be-}}, {{lang|de|ge-}}, {{lang|de|er-}}, {{lang|de|ver-}}, {{lang|de|zer-}}, {{lang|de|ent-}}, {{lang|de|emp-}} and a few other inseparable prefixes are stressed on the root.
* Words beginning with the separable prefixes {{lang|de|ab-}}, {{lang|de|auf-}}, {{lang|de|ein-}}, {{lang|de|vor-}}, and most [[prepositional adverb]]s are stressed on the prefix.
* Some prefixes, notably {{lang|de|über-}}, {{lang|de|unter-}}, {{lang|de|um-}}, and {{lang|de|durch-}}, can function as separable or inseparable prefixes and are stressed or not accordingly.
* A few homographs with such prefixes exist. They are not perfect homophones. Consider the word {{lang|de|umschreiben}}. As {{lang|de|ˈum•schreiben}} (separable prefix), it means 'to rewrite' and is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈʔʊmʃʀaɪ̯bən]}}, with stress on the first syllable. Its associated noun, {{lang|de|die ˈUmschreibung}} is also stressed on the first syllable - {{IPA|[ˈʔʊmʃʀaɪ̯bʊŋ]}}. On the other hand, {{lang|de|umˈschreiben}} (inseparable prefix) is pronounced {{IPA|[ʔʊmˈʃʀaɪ̯bən]}}, with stress on the second syllable. This word means 'to paraphrase', and its associated noun, {{lang|de|die Umˈschreibung}} is also stressed on the second syllable - {{IPA|[ʔʊmˈʃʀaɪ̯bʊŋ]}}. Another example is the word {{lang|de|umˈfahren}}; with stress on the root ({{IPA|[ʔʊmˈfaːʀən]}}) it means 'to drive around (an obstacle in the street)', and with stress on the prefix ({{IPA|[ˈʔʊmfaːʀən]}}) it means 'to run down/over' or 'to knock down'.

==Acquisition==

===General===
Like all infants, German infants go through a [[babbling]] stage in the early phases of phonological acquisition, during which they produce the sounds they will later use in their first words.&lt;ref name="Meibauer 261"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Meibauer|Demske|Geilfuß-Wolfgang|Pafel|2007|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phoneme]] inventories begin with [[Stop consonant|stops]], [[nasal consonant|nasals]], and [[vowel]]s; (contrasting) [[short vowel]]s and [[Liquid consonant|liquids]] appear next, followed by [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] and [[Affricate consonant|affricates]], and finally all other [[German phonology#Consonants|consonants]] and [[consonant cluster]]s.&lt;ref name="Meibauer 263"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Meibauer|Demske|Geilfuß-Wolfgang|Pafel|2007|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children begin to produce protowords near the end of their first year. These words do not approximate adult forms, yet have a specific and consistent meaning.&lt;ref name="Meibauer 261"/&gt; Early word productions are phonetically simple and usually follow the [[syllable]] structure CV or CVC, although this generalization has been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Grijzenhout|Joppen|1998|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[German phonology#Vowels|vowels]] produced are {{IPA|/ə/}}, {{IPA|/a/}}, and {{IPA|/aː/}}, followed by {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, with [[rounded vowel]]s emerging last.&lt;ref name="Meibauer 263"/&gt; German children often use phonological processes to simplify their early word production.&lt;ref name="Meibauer 263"/&gt; For example, they may delete an unstressed syllable ({{lang|de|Schokolade}} 'chocolate' pronounced {{IPA|[ˈlaːdə]}}),&lt;ref name="Meibauer 263"/&gt; or replace a fricative with a corresponding stop ({{lang|de|Dach}} {{IPA|[dax]}} 'roof' pronounced {{IPA|[dak]}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Meibauer|Demske|Geilfuß-Wolfgang|Pafel|2007|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; One case study found that a 17-month-old child acquiring German replaced the [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|[x]}} with the nearest available [[continuant]] {{IPA|[h]}}, or deleted it altogether ({{lang|de|Buch}} {{IPA|[buːx]}} 'book' pronounced {{IPA|[buh]}} or {{IPA|[buː]}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Grijzenhout|Joppen|1998|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowel space development===
In 2009, Lintfert examined the development of [[vowel space]] of German speakers in their first three years of life. During the [[babbling]] stage, vowel distribution has no clear pattern. However, [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] and [[unstressed vowel]]s already show different distributions in the vowel space. Once word production begins, [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed vowels]] expand in the [[vowel space]], while the [[Vowel height|F1]]-[[Vowel backness|F2]] vowel space of unstressed vowels becomes more centralized. The majority of infants are then capable of stable production of F1.&lt;ref name="Lintfert 159"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lintfert|2010|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that the variability of [[Formant|formant frequencies]] among individuals decreases with age.&lt;ref name="Lintfert 138"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lintfert|2010|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 24 months, infants expand their vowel space individually at different rates. However, if the parents' utterances possess a well-defined vowel space, their children produce clearly distinguished vowel classes earlier.&lt;ref name="Lintfert 160"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lintfert|2010|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; By about three years old, children command the production of all vowels, and they attempt to produce the four [[cardinal vowel]]s, {{IPA|/y/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/a/}}, at the extreme limits of the F1-F2 vowel space (i.e., the height and backness of the vowels are made extreme by the infants).&lt;ref name="Lintfert 138"/&gt;

===Grammatical words===
Generally, [[Closed class|closed-class]] grammatical words (e.g. articles and prepositions) are absent from children's speech when they first begin to combine words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Höhle|Weissenborn|2003|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, children as young as 18 months old show knowledge of these closed-class words when they prefer stories with them, compared to passages with them omitted. Therefore, the absence of these grammatical words cannot be due to perceptual problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Höhle|Weissenborn|2003|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers tested children's comprehension of four grammatical words: {{lang|de|bis}} {{IPA|[bɪs}}] ('up to'), {{lang|de|von}} {{IPA|[fɔn]}} ('from'), {{lang|de|das}} {{IPA|[das]}} ('the' neuter singular), and {{lang|de|sein}} {{IPA|[zaɪ̯n]}} ('his'). After first being familiarized with the words, eight-month-old children looked longer in the direction of a speaker playing a text passage that contained these previously heard words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Höhle|Weissenborn|2003|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this ability is absent in six-month-olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Höhle|Weissenborn|2003|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nasals===
The acquisition of nasals in German differs from that of [[Dutch language|Dutch]], a phonologically closely related language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Altvater-Mackensen|Fikkert|2007|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; German children produce proportionately more nasals in [[Syllable#Onset|onset position]] (sounds before a vowel in a syllable) than Dutch children do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Altvater-Mackensen|Fikkert|2007|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; German children, once they reached 16 months, also produced significantly more nasals in syllables containing [[schwa]]s, when compared with Dutch-speaking children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Altvater-Mackensen|Fikkert|2007|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may reflect differences in the languages the children are being exposed to, although the researchers claim that the development of nasals likely cannot be seen apart from the more general phonological system the child is developing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Altvater-Mackensen|Fikkert|2007|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonotactic constraints and reading===
A 2006 study examined the acquisition of German in [[Speech-Language Pathology|phonologically delayed]] children (specifically, issues with fronting of [[Velar consonant|velars]] and stopping of fricatives) and whether they applied [[Optimality Theory|phonotactic constraints]] to word-initial [[consonant cluster]]s containing these modified consonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ott|van de Vijner|Höhle|2006|p=323}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the subjects (mean age = 5;1) avoided making [[Phonotactics|phonotactic]] violations, opting instead for other consonants or clusters in their speech. This suggests that phonotactic constraints do apply to the speech of German children with phonological delay, at least in the case of word-initial consonant clusters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ott|van de Vijner|Höhle|2006|p=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional research&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Goswami|Ziegler|Richardson|2005|p=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; has also shown that spelling consistencies seen in German raise children's [[phonemic awareness]] as they acquire reading skills.

==Sound changes==

===Sound changes and mergers===
A [[Merger (phonology)|merger]] found mostly in Northern accents of German is that of {{IPA|/ɛː/}} (spelled {{angbr|ä, äh}}) with {{IPA|/eː/}} (spelled {{angbr|e}}, {{angbr|ee}}, or {{angbr|eh}}). Some speakers merge the two everywhere, some distinguish them everywhere, others keep {{IPA|/ɛː/}} distinct only in [[conditional mood|conditional]] forms of [[strong inflection|strong]] [[verb]]s (for example {{lang|de|ich gäbe}} {{IPA|[ˈɡɛːbə]}} 'I would give' vs. {{lang|de|ich gebe}} {{IPA|[ˈɡeːbə]}} 'I give' are distinguished, but {{lang|de|Bären}} {{IPA|[ˈbeːʁən]}} 'bears' vs. {{lang|de|Beeren}} {{IPA|[ˈbeːʁən]}} 'berries' are not. Standard pronunciation of {{lang|de|Bären}} is {{IPA|[ˈbɛːʁən]}}).

Another common [[Merger (phonology)|merger]] is that of {{IPA|/ɡ/}} at the end of a syllable with {{IPA|[ç]}} or {{IPA|[x]}}, for instance {{lang|de|Krieg}} {{IPA|[kʁ̥iː'''ç''']}} ('war'), but {{lang|de|Kriege}} {{IPA|[ˈkʁ̥iː'''ɡ'''ə]}} ('wars'); {{lang|de|er lag}} {{IPA|[laː'''x''']}} ('he lay'), but {{lang|de|wir lagen}} {{IPA|[ˈlaː'''ɡ'''ən]}} ('we lay'). This pronunciation is frequent all over central and northern Germany. It is characteristic of regional languages and dialects, particularly [[Low German]] in the North, where {{angbr|g}} represents a [[Fricative consonant|fricative]], becoming [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] in the [[syllable coda]], as is common in German ([[final-obstruent devoicing]]). However common it is, this pronunciation is considered sub-standard. Only in one case, in the grammatical ending {{lang|de|-ig}} (which corresponds to English ''-y''), the fricative pronunciation of final {{angbr|g}} is prescribed by the [[Theodor Siebs|Siebs]] standard, for instance {{lang|de|wichtig}} {{IPA|[ˈvɪçtɪç]}} ('important'). The merger occurs neither in [[Austro-Bavarian]] and [[Alemannic German]] nor in the corresponding varieties of [[Standard German]], and therefore in these regions {{lang|de|-ig}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ɪɡ̊]}}.

Many speakers do not distinguish the [[affricate]] {{IPA|/p͡f/}} from the simple [[fricative]] {{IPA|/f/}} in the beginning of a word, in which case the verb {{lang|de|(er) fährt}} ('[he] travels') and the noun {{lang|de|Pferd}} ('horse') are both pronounced {{IPA|[fɛɐ̯t]}}. This most commonly occurs in northern and western Germany, where the local dialects did not originally have the sound {{IPA|/p͡f/}}. Some speakers also have peculiar pronunciation for {{IPA|/p͡f/}} in the middle or end of a word, replacing the {{IPA|[f]}} in {{IPA|/p͡f/}} with a [[voiceless bilabial fricative]], i.e. a consonant produced by pressing air flow through the tensed lips. Thereby {{lang|de|Tropfen}} ('drop') becomes {{IPA|[ˈtʁ̥ɔp͡ɸn̩]}}, rather than {{IPA|[ˈtʁ̥ɔp͡fn̩]}}.

Many speakers who have a vocalization of {{IPA|/r/}} after {{IPA|/a/}} merge this combination with long {{IPA|/aː/}} (i.e. {{IPA|/ar/}} &gt; {{IPA|*[aɐ]}} or {{IPA|*[ɑɐ]}} &gt; {{IPA|[aː]}} or {{IPA|[ɑː]}}). Hereby, {{lang|de|Schaf}} ('sheep') and {{lang|de|scharf}} ('sharp') can both be pronounced {{IPA|[ʃaːf]}} or {{IPA|[ʃɑːf]}}. This merger does not occur where {{IPA|/a/}} is a front vowel while {{IPA|/aː/}} is realised as a back vowel. Here the words are kept distinct as {{IPA|[ʃɑːf]}} ('sheep') and {{IPA|[ʃaːf]}} ('sharp'). &lt;br&gt; 
In umlaut forms, the difference usually reoccurs: {{lang|de|Schäfer}} {{IPA|[ˈʃɛːfɐ]}} or {{IPA|{{IPA|[ˈʃeːfɐ]}}}} vs. {{lang|de|schärfer}} {{IPA|[ˈʃɛɐ̯fɐ]}}. Speakers with this merger also often use {{IPA|[aːç]}} (instead of formally normal {{IPA|/aːx/}}) where it stems from original {{IPA|/arç/}}. The word {{lang|de|Archen}} ('arks') is thus pronounced {{IPA|[ˈʔaːçn̩]}}, which makes a minimal pair with {{lang|de|[[Aachen]]}} {{IPA|[ʔaːxn̩]}}, making the difference between {{IPA|[ç]}} and {{IPA|[x]}} [[phonem]]ic, rather than just [[allophone|allophonic]], for these speakers.

In the standard pronunciation, the vowel qualities {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/ɪ/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, as well as {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/ʊ/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, are all still distinguished even in unstressed syllables. In this latter case, however, many simplify the system in various degrees. For some speakers, this may go so far as to merge all four into one, whence misspellings by schoolchildren such as {{lang|de|Bräut'''e'''gam}} (instead of {{lang|de|Bräut'''i'''gam}}) or {{lang|de|Port'''o'''gal}} (instead of ''Port'''u'''gal'').

In everyday speech, more [[Merger (phonology)|mergers]] occur, some of which are universal and some of which are typical for certain regions or dialect backgrounds. Overall, there is a strong tendency of reduction and contraction. For example, long vowels may be shortened, consonant clusters may be simplified, word-final {{IPA|[ə]}} may be dropped in some cases, and the suffix {{lang|de|-en}} may be contracted with preceding consonants, e.g. {{IPA|[ham]}} for {{lang|de|haben}} {{IPA|[ˈhaːbən]}} ('to have').

If the clusters {{IPA|[mp]}}, {{IPA|[lt]}}, {{IPA|[nt]}}, or {{IPA|[ŋk]}} are followed by another consonant, the stops {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} usually lose their phonemic status. Thus while the standard pronunciation distinguishes {{lang|de|ganz}} {{IPA|[ɡant͡s]}} ('whole') from {{lang|de|Gans}} {{IPA|[ɡans]}} ('goose'), as well as {{lang|de|er sinkt}} {{IPA|[zɪŋkt]}} from {{lang|de|er singt}} {{IPA|[zɪŋt]}}, the two pairs are homophones for most speakers. The commonest practice is to drop the stop (thus {{IPA|[ɡans]}}, {{IPA|[zɪŋt]}} for both words), but some speakers insert the stop where it is not etymological ({{IPA|[ɡants]}}, {{IPA|[zɪŋkt]}} for both words), or they alternate between the two ways. Only a few speakers retain a phonemic distinction.

===Middle High German===
The [[Middle High German]] vowels {{IPA|[ei̯]}} and {{IPA|[iː]}} developed into the modern [[Standard German]] diphthong {{IPA|[aɪ̯]}}, whereas {{IPA|[ou̯]}} and {{IPA|[uː]}} developed into {{IPA|[aʊ̯]}}. For example, Middle High German {{lang|gmh|heiz}} {{IPA|/hei̯s/}} and {{lang|gmh|wîz}} {{IPA|/wiːs/}} ('hot' and 'white') became Standard German {{lang|de|heiß}} {{IPA|/haɪ̯s/}} and {{lang|de|weiß}} {{IPA|/vaɪ̯s/}}. In some dialects, the Middle High German vowels have not changed, e.g. [[Swiss German]] {{lang|de|heiss}} {{IPA|/hei̯s/}} and {{lang|de|wiiss}} {{IPA|/viːs/}}, while in other dialects or languages, the vowels have changed but the distinction is kept, e.g. [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]] {{lang|bar|hoaß}} {{IPA|/hɔɐ̯s/}} and {{lang|bar|weiß}} {{IPA|/vaɪ̯s/}}, [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] {{lang|ksh|heeß}} {{IPA|/heːs/}} and {{lang|ksh|wieß}} {{IPA|/viːs/}}, [[Yiddish]] {{lang|yi|הײס}} ''{{transl|yi|heys}}'' {{IPA|/hɛɪ̯s/}} and {{lang|yi|װײַס}} ''{{transl|yi|vays}}'' {{IPA|/vaɪ̯s/}}.

The Middle High German [[diphthong]]s {{IPA|[iə̯]}}, {{IPA|[uə̯]}} and {{IPA|[yə̯]}} became the modern [[Standard German]] long vowels {{IPA|[iː]}}, {{IPA|[uː]}} and {{IPA|[yː]}} after the Middle High German long vowels changed to diphthongs. Most [[Upper German]] dialects retain the diphthongs. A remnant of their former diphthong character is shown when {{IPA|[iː]}} continues to be written {{lang|de|ie}} in German (as in {{lang|de|Liebe}} 'love').

==Loanwords==

German incorporates a significant number of [[loanword]]s from other languages. Loanwords are often adapted to German phonology but to varying degrees, depending on the speaker and the commonness of the word. {{IPA|/ʒ/}} and {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} do not occur in native German words but are common in a number of French and English loan words. Many speakers replace them with {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} respectively (especially in Southern Germany, Austria and Switzerland), so that {{lang|de|Dschungel}} (from English ''jungle'') can be pronounced {{IPA|[ˈd͡ʒʊŋl̩]}} or {{IPA|[ˈt͡ʃʊŋl̩]}}. Some speakers in Northern and Western Germany merge {{IPA|/ʒ/}} with {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}}, so that {{lang|de|Journalist}} (phonemically {{IPA|/d͡ʒʊʁnaˈlɪst ~ ʒʊʁnaˈlɪst/}}) can be pronounced {{IPA|[ʒʊɐ̯naˈlɪst]}}, {{IPA|[d͡ʒʊɐ̯naˈlɪst]}} or {{IPA|[ʃʊɐ̯naˈlɪst]}}. The realization of {{IPA|/ʒ/}} as {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}}, however, is uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;http://prowiki.ids-mannheim.de/bin/view/AADG/ZhimAnlaut&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loanwords from English===
Many English words are used in German, especially in technology and pop culture. Some speakers pronounce them similarly to their native pronunciation, but many speakers change non-native phonemes to similar German phonemes (even if they pronounce them in a rather English manner in an English-language setting):
* English {{IPA|/θ, ð/}} are usually pronounced as in RP or General American; some speakers replace them with {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} respectively ([[th-alveolarization]]) e.g. {{lang|de|Thriller}} {{IPA|[ˈθʁɪlɐ ~ ˈsʁɪlɐ]}}.
* English {{IPA|/ɹ/}} can be pronounced the same as in English, i.e. {{IPAblink|ɹ}}, or as the corresponding native German {{IPA|/r/}} e.g. {{lang|de|Rock}} {{IPA|[ʀɔk]}} or {{IPA|[rɔk]}}. German and Austrian speakers tend to be [[Rhotic_consonant#Other_Germanic_languages|variably rhotic]].
* English {{IPA|/w/}} is often replaced with German {{IPA|/v/}} e.g. {{lang|de|Whiskey}} {{IPA|[ˈvɪskiː]}}.
* word-initial {{IPA|/s/}} is often retained (especially in the South, where word-initial {{IPA|/s/}} is common),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowiki.ids-mannheim.de/bin/view/AADG/SimAnlaut|title=SimAnlaut &lt; AADG &lt; TWiki|author=|date=|website=prowiki.ids-mannheim.de|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but many speakers replace it with {{IPA|/z/}} e.g. {{lang|de|Sound}} {{IPA|[zaʊ̯nt]}}.
* word-initial {{IPA|/st/}} and {{IPA|/sp/}} are usually retained, but some speakers (especially in South Western Germany and Western Austria) replace them with {{IPA|/ʃt/}} and {{IPA|/ʃp/}} e.g. {{lang|de|Steak}} {{IPA|[ʃteɪk]}} or {{IPA|[ʃteːk]}}, {{lang|de|Spray}} {{IPA|[ʃpʁeɪ]}} or {{IPA|[ʃpʁeː]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowiki.ids-mannheim.de/bin/view/AADG/SteakSprayStSp|title=SteakSprayStSp &lt; AADG &lt; TWiki|author=|date=|website=prowiki.ids-mannheim.de|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* English {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} is usually retained, but in Northern and Western Germany, as well as Luxembourg it is often replaced with {{IPA|/ʃ/}} e.g. {{lang|de|Chips}} {{IPA|[ʃɪps]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowiki.ids-mannheim.de/bin/view/AADG/ChipsCh|title=ChipsCh &lt; AADG &lt; TWiki|author=|date=|website=prowiki.ids-mannheim.de|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Northern Standard German, [[final-obstruent devoicing]] is applied to English loan words just as to other words e.g. {{lang|de|Airbag}} {{IPA|[ˈɛːɐ̯bɛk]}}, {{lang|de|Lord}} {{IPA|[lɔʁt]}} or {{IPA|[lɔɐ̯t]}}, {{lang|de|Backstage}} {{IPA|[ˈbɛksteːt͡ʃ]}}. However, in Southern Standard German, in Swiss Standard German and Austrian Standard German, final-obstruent devoicing does not occur and so speakers are more likely to retain the original pronunciation of word-final lenes (although realizing them as fortes may occur because of confusing English spelling with pronunciation).
* English {{IPA|/eɪ/}} and {{IPA|/oʊ/}} are often replaced with {{IPA|/eː/}} and {{IPA|/oː/}} respectively e.g. {{lang|de|Homepage}} {{IPA|[ˈhoːmpeːt͡ʃ]}}.
* English {{IPA|/æ/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}} are pronounced the same, as German {{IPA|/ɛ/}} ([[met–mat merger]]) e.g. {{lang|de|Backup}} {{IPA|[ˈbɛkap]}}.
* English {{IPA|/ɒ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔː/}} are pronounced the same, as German {{IPA|/ɔ/}} ([[cot–caught merger]]) e.g. {{lang|de|Box}} {{IPA|[bɔks]}}.
* English {{IPA|/ʌ/}} is usually pronounced as German {{IPA|/a/}} e.g. {{lang|de|Cutter}} {{IPA|[ˈkatɐ]}}.
* English {{IPA|/ɜːr/}} is usually pronounced as German {{IPA|/œʁ/}} e.g. {{lang|de|Shirt}} {{IPA|[ʃœʁt]}} or {{IPA|[ʃœɐ̯t]}}.
* English {{IPA|/i/}} is pronounced as {{IPA|/iː/}} ([[happy-tensing]]) e.g. {{lang|de|Whisk(e)y}} {{IPA|[ˈvɪskiː]}}.

==Sample==
The sample text is a reading of the first sentence of "[[The North Wind and the Sun]]". The phonemic transcription treats every instance of {{IPA|[ɐ]}} and {{IPA|[ɐ̯]}} as {{IPA|/ər/}} and {{IPA|/r/}}, respectively. The phonetic transcription is a fairly narrow transcription of the educated northern accent. The speaker transcribed in the narrow transcription is 62 years old, and he is reading in a colloquial style.&lt;ref name="Kohler86"/&gt; Aspiration, glottal stops and devoicing of the lenes after fortes are not transcribed.

Note that the audio file contains the whole fable, and that it was recorded by a much younger speaker.

===Phonemic transcription===

[[File:Private wine licence sign.jpg|thumb|Information sign on a bicycle to a 'Strausse', a private wine licence in Boetzingen, Germany]]
A '''''Strausse''''' or '''''Strausswirtschaft''''' (also '''''Strauße''''' or '''''Straußwirtschaft''''') is a type of wine tavern in [[winegrowing]] areas of [[German language|German]]-speaking countries that is only open during certain times of the year. Typically it is a pub run by winegrowers and winemakers themselves, in which they sell their own wine directly to the public. The food served needs to be simple, regional cold dishes. Other expressions like ''Besenwirtschaft'' and ''Besenschänke'' ("broom pub"), ''Rädlewirtschaft'' ("cyclists' pub") as well as ''Hecken-'' or ''Häckerwirtschaft'' are also common.

==Characterization==

A ''Strausswirtschaft'' is essentially understood to be a winemaker serving his own wine on his own premises. These seasonal inns are not subject to normal business laws and are thus not obliged to have a licence or to pay extra taxes. They must, however, fulfil certain conditions instead. These conditions vary from [[States of Germany|state]] to state but they are in general agreement on certain essential points (see "Legal aspects" below).

The kinds of locations in which a ''Strausswirtschaft'' can be found can vary considerably. Besides ones funished like ordinary pubs there are also simple barns where benches and tables have been temporarily set up to accommodate guests. In earlier decades some winegrowers even cleared their flats or the stables to run such a tavern. In [[Austria]] this kind of pub is called a ''[[Buschenschank]]'' or ''[[Heuriger]]''. The name is derived from a bar or post to which a so-called ''Föhrenbusch'' or a ''Reisigbesen'' (a kind of besom or broom) was attached. This helps to explain another expression associated with the Strausswirtschaft: ''Ausg'steckt is{{'}}'' ("It is attached"). By attaching the bar outside, the pub owner was informing the tax collector about the pub's tax liability. The ''Buschenschank'' and the expression ''Ausg'steckt is{{'}}'' can be traced back to a regulation by [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Empress Maria Theresia]].

==Origins==

The enactment "''[[Capitulare de villis]] vel curtis imperii''" by [[Charlemagne]] is often mentioned as the historical standard for the ''Strausswirtschaft''. It enabled winemakers to sell their own products free of business tax. The ''Strausswirtschaft'' (''Strauss'' – German for bunch of flowers; ''Wirtschaft'' – pub, inn) had to be marked as such by a bunch of flowers put up at the entrance.

Typical dishes offered are rather simple and rich. Regional specialities are for instance:
[[File:Spundekaes-Bachus-1.jpg|thumb|''Spundekäs'' with pretzels]]
[[File:WeckWorschtWoi1.jpg|thumb|''Weck, Worscht un Woi'']]
* ''[[Schlachtplatte]]'' (black pudding, [[liverwurst]] and [[sauerkraut]])
* ''Spundekäs'' in [[Rheinhessen (wine region)|Rhenish Hesse]] and the [[Rheingau (wine region)|Rheingau]]
* ''Weck, Worscht un Woi'' in Rhenish Hesse, the Rheingau and the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]]
* ''Pfälzer [[Saumagen]]'' (Palatine sow’s stomach)
* ''[[Maultasche]]n'' (Swabian pockets) with potato salad
* ''Winzerteller'' (sausage and cheese dish)
* ''[[Wurstsalat]]'' (sausage salad)
* ''[[Zwiebelkuchen]]'' (onion pie)
* ''Flammkuchen'' ([[Tarte flambée]])
* [[Bratwurst]] and [[Kraut]]
* ''Blaue Zipfel'' (in [[Franconia]])
* Dressed [[Camembert (cheese)|Camembert]] (in Franconia)
* ''Kuhkäs'' (in Franconia - a cheese dish)

Elaborate dishes are not allowed.

==Legal aspects==

Almost nowhere are ''Strausswirtschaften'' considered restaurants, which means that owners do not need a concession. Nevertheless, the trade office needs to be notified in advance about the period during which the ''Stausswirtschaft'' intends to sell food and drink.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommunal-web.de/formulare/bundesrecht/133006.pdf Anzeige des Betriebs einer Straußwirtschaft]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although ''Strausswirtschaften'' do not need a licence, there are certain laws they have to follow. Among other things, a ''Strausswirtschaften'' is not allowed to offer lodging or engage in trade. Food and beverage must be served at the place of production. It is forbidden to rent any extra facilities for serving food and beverage. 
The following rules need to be respected: 

* Selling food and drink is limited to four months a year
* The opening times can be divided into two periods.
* There is a maximum capacity of 40 seats. There are no rules, however, dictating the number of people permitted to squeeze in on the benches or likewise the number of people allowed to stand around drinking their wine. Exception: In [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] there is no limit on the number of seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/gastg/__14.html Gaststättengesetz § 14 Straußwirtschaften]&lt;/ref&gt;
*A minimum of hygiene has to be considered and is subject to public control
* Strausswirtschaften are only allowed to serve very simple dishes. Hot sausages and loin ribs with sauerkraut are given as such an example in the regulations as well as coffee and cake.
* [[Beer]] and other alcoholic beverages (excluding wine) must not be served. Home distilled spirits, however, are allowed. Alongside wine and/or [[cider]] at least one non-alcoholic drink has to be offered. Tap water is explicitly excluded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forstexperten.de/Besteuerung.pdf Besteuerung der Land- und Forstwirtschaft]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sound change}}
In [[linguistics]], '''synaeresis''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɪ|ˈ|n|ɛ|r|ə|s|ɪ|s}}; also spelled '''syneresis''') is a phonological process of sound change in which two adjacent vowels within a word are ''combined'' into a single syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trask|first=R. L.|title=The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics|year=2000|publisher=Edinburgh UP|location=Edinburgh|page=333|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHeGzQ8wuLQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=333&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposite process, in which two adjacent vowels are pronounced separately, is known as "[[Hiatus (linguistics)|diaeresis]]".

For any given word, speakers generally hold a traditional view about the ''standard'' pronunciation of that word.  When realized in a careful reading style, each particular word is associated with this single, ''standard'' phonetic form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laporte|first=Eric|title=A Formal Tool for Modelling "Standard" Phonetic Variations|url=http://www.isca-speech.org/archive_open/archive_papers/ppospst/pp91_039.pdf|work=ISCA Archive|publisher=ESCA Workshop on Phonetics and Phonology of Speaking Styles|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, each word also possesses multiple non-standard or reduced phonetic forms which are produced in a greater range of contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laporte|first=Eric|title=A Formal Tool for Modelling "Standard" Phonetic Variations|url=http://www.isca-speech.org/archive_open/archive_papers/ppospst/pp91_039.pdf|work=ISCA Archive|publisher=ESCA Workshop on Phonetics and Phonology of Speaking Styles|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These multiple variations in the pronunciation of a single word are referred to as allophonic variants.  To classify one of these other forms as an allophonic variant of a word means that pronouncing the word in this way will not change the intended meaning of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laporte|first=Eric|title=A Formal Tool for Modelling "Standard" Phonetic Variations|url=http://www.isca-speech.org/archive_open/archive_papers/ppospst/pp91_039.pdf|work=ISCA Archive|publisher=ESCA Workshop on Phonetics and Phonology of Speaking Styles|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Synaeresis is one of various phonological processes in which segments of words or phrases are lost.  The general term for a loss of sound segments in the field of linguistics is known as "[[elision]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trask|first=R. L.|title=The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics|year=2000|publisher=Edinburgh UP|location=Edinburgh|page=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHeGzQ8wuLQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=333&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other types of elision include the processes of [[apheresis (linguistics)|apheresis]], [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]], [[apocope]], [[synizesis]], and [[synaloepha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trask|first=R. L.|title=The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics|year=2000|publisher=Edinburgh UP|location=Edinburgh|page=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHeGzQ8wuLQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=333&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Synaeresis comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|συναίρεσις}} (''synaíresis''), a "contraction", a "taking ''or'' drawing together",&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|sunai/resis|συναίρεσις|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang|grc|συναιρέω}} (''synairéō''), "(I) contract", "(I) grasp ''or'' seize together",&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|sunaire/w|συναιρέω|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; derived from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:σύν|σύν]]}}, "with",&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|sun|σύν|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:αἱρέω|αἱρέω]]}}, "(I) grasp, seize".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|ai(re/w|αἱρέω|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Semantically, it is easy to understand how this term evolved historically. The term eventually becamer applied to a process in which vowels are taken or drawn together.

==English==
Synaeresis often occurs with [[reduced vowel]]s in [[English language|English]], as in [[Asia]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|z|i|ə}} → {{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|ʒ|ə}}) and [[Sebastian (disambiguation)|Sebastian]] ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|b|æ|s|t|i|ə|n}} → {{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|b|æ|s|tʃ|ə|n}}).

==French==
Synaeresis is a common process in [[French language|French]]. For example, the French word ''louer,'' which means ‘to praise,’ is typically pronounced as [lwe] according to transcriptions using the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laporte|first=Eric|title=A Formal Tool for Modelling "Standard" Phonetic Variations|url=http://www.isca-speech.org/archive_open/archive_papers/ppospst/pp91_039.pdf|work=ISCA Archive|publisher=ESCA Workshop on Phonetics and Phonology of Speaking Styles|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That pronunciation reduces the [u] vowel to a [w], or a [[Semivowel|glide]] sound, when pronounced in conjunction with the [e] vowel sound. In this example, the standard pronunciation uses the process of synaeresis to compress both of the original vowel sounds into one syllable. However, when speakers are asked to produce this word in a more controlled situation, in a careful reading style, French speakers often produce extended forms or different allophonic variants for the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laporte|first=Eric|title=A Formal Tool for Modelling "Standard" Phonetic Variations|url=http://www.isca-speech.org/archive_open/archive_papers/ppospst/pp91_039.pdf|work=ISCA Archive|publisher=ESCA Workshop on Phonetics and Phonology of Speaking Styles|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These forms of the word include [lue] according to IPA transcriptions, in which the two vowels are pronounced separately using the process of diaeresis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laporte|first=Eric|title=A Formal Tool for Modelling "Standard" Phonetic Variations|url=http://www.isca-speech.org/archive_open/archive_papers/ppospst/pp91_039.pdf|work=ISCA Archive|publisher=ESCA Workshop on Phonetics and Phonology of Speaking Styles|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek==

===Ancient Greek===
In [[Ancient Greek]], synaeresis{{refn|group=n|Note on terminology:&lt;br&gt;In ancient books in Greek, vowel contraction in general, including synaeresis and [[crasis]], is often called ''crasis'' or is analysed into various classes using related terms.&lt;ref name=OEDcrasis&gt;{{OED|crasis}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} is the merging and pronunciation of two separate vowels as a [[diphthong]] (e.g. α + ι → αι {{IPA|/ai&amp;#814;/}}) or a [[Vowel length|long vowel]] (e.g. ο + ο → ου {{IPA|/ο:/}}); a characteristic example of this is the [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] class or classes of [[Ancient Greek grammar (tables)#Contracted verbs|contracted verbs]] ({{lang-grc-gre|συνῃρημένα}} – or {{lang|grc|περισπώμενα – ῥήματα}}). [[Diaeresis (prosody)|Diaeresis]] on the other hand, is the separation of a diphthong into two vowels (αϊ {{IPA|/a.i/}}).

Certain words in Proto-Indo-European had two vowels separated by the consonant ''s'' or ''y'' (''esu'' "good"). In Greek, this consonant changed to ''h'' (''ehu''), and was lost between vowels (''eu''). In [[Homer]], the two vowels were sometimes pronounced separately (diaeresis: {{lang|grc|ἐΰ}}) and sometimes together (synaeresis: {{lang|grc|εὖ}}). Later in [[Attic Greek]], they were always pronounced together.

In Greek synaeresis, two vowels merge to form a long version of one of the two vowels (e.g. ''e'' + ''a'' → ''ā''), a diphthong with a different main vowel (e.g. ''a'' + ''ei'' → ''āi''), or a new vowel intermediate between the originals (e.g. ''a'' + ''o'' → ''ō''). Contraction of ''e'' + ''o'' or ''o'' + ''e'' leads to ''ou'', and ''e'' + ''e'' to ''ei'', which are in this case [[spurious diphthong]]s.

In general, the accent after contraction copies the accent before contraction. Often this means circumflex accent. But for nouns, accent follows the nominative singular. Sometimes this means a different accent from the uncontracted form — i.e., whenever the ending has a long vowel.

Contraction in Greek occurs throughout the present and imperfect of contracted verbs and in the future of other verbs. There are three categories based on the vowel of contraction: ''a'', ''e'', or ''o''.

Some [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] nouns show contraction:

* {{lang|grc|λειτ'''ο-ε'''ργίᾱ}} → {{lang|grc|λειτ'''ου'''ργίᾱ}} "[[liturgy]]"

===Modern Greek===
In Modern Greek, where original diphthongs are pronounced as monophthongs, synaeresis is the pronunciation of two vowel sounds as a [[monophthong]], and diaeresis is the pronunciation of the two vowels as a diphthong (αϊ {{IPA|/ai&amp;#814;/}}).{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==History==

Võro is a descendant of the old [[South Estonian]] regional language and is the least influenced by Standard Estonian (which is based on Northern Estonian dialects).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/detail_object/o:308890?SID=76572&amp;actPage=2&amp;type=listview&amp;sortfield=fgs.createdDate,STRING&amp;sortreverse=0 |last=Koreinik |first=Kadri |title=Võro kiil|publisher=Studies in European Language Diversity 23.2 |date=2013 |accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Võro was once spoken further south and east of historical Võromaa in South Estonian-speaking enclaves Lutsi, Leivu and Kraasna in what is now [[Latvia]] and [[Russia]]. In addition to Võro, other contemporary variants of South Estonian include the [[South Estonian language|Mulgi]], [[Tartu language|Tartu]] and [[Seto dialect]].

One of the earliest written evidences of South Estonian is a translation of the [[New Testament]] (''Wastne Testament'') published in 1686. Although the status of South Estonian began to diminish after the 1880s, the language began to undergo a revival in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/detail_object/o:308888?SID=76572&amp;actPage=1&amp;type=listview&amp;sortfield=fgs.createdDate,STRING&amp;sortreverse=0 |last=Koreinik |first=Kadri |title=The Võro language in Estonia: ELDIA Case-Specific Report |publisher=Studies in European Language Diversity 23 |date=2013 |accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present situation==

The majority of Estonians perceive the Võro language as a modern synonym for South Estonian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sgr.fi/sust/sust258/sust258_pajusalu.pdf |format=PDF |last=Pajusalu |first=Karl |title= The reforming of the Southern Finnic language area. The Quasquicentennial of the Finno-Ugrian Society. Suomalais-Ugrilaisen Seuran Toimituksia = Mémoires de la Société Finno-Ougrienne 258 |location= Helsinki |year=2009 |pages=95–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Võro is used in the works of some of Estonia's best-known playwrights, poets, and authors ([[Madis Kõiv]], [[Ülle Kauksi]], [[Jaan Kaplinski]], [[Ain Kaalep]], etc.). One newspaper is printed in Võro: the fortnightly ''[[Uma Leht]]'' (literally 'Our Own Newspaper'). 26 public schools offer weekly special classes (mostly [[extracurricular activities|extracurricular]]) in modern Võro.

Estonia's contribution to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004]] was the song "[[Tii]]", which was performed by [[Neiokõsõ]] in Võro. 

The language is endangered,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language-id-422.html |title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger |publisher=Unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Kadri Koreinik this is due to the government's lack of legal commitment to protect the language.&lt;ref name="koreinik1"/&gt;

==Orthography==

Võro employs the [[Latin script]], like Estonian and Finnish.

|}

Most letters (including ''ä'', ''ö'', ''ü'', and ''õ'') denote the same sounds as in Estonian, with a few exceptions. The letter ''q'' stands for the [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}} and ''y'' denotes {{IPAslink|ɨ}}, a vowel very close to [[Russian language|Russian]] ''ы'' or [[Polish language|Polish]] ''y'' (from 2005 written ''õ'').

[[Palatalization (phonetics)|Palatalization]] of consonants is marked with an [[acute accent]] (´) or [[apostrophe]] ('). In proper typography and in handwriting, the palatalisation mark does not extend above the [[cap height]] (except uppercase letters ''Ń'', ''Ŕ'', ''Ś'', ''V́'' etc.), and it is written above the letter if the letter has no [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] (''ǵ'', ''ḿ'', ''ń'', ''ṕ'', ''ŕ'', ''ś'', ''v́'' etc.) but written to the right of it otherwise (''b’'', ''d’'', ''f’'', ''h’'', ''k’'', ''l’'', ''t’''). In computing, it is not usually possible to enter these character combinations or to make them look esthetically pleasing with most common fonts, so the apostrophe is generally placed after the letter in all cases. This convention is followed in this article as well.

====Vowel harmony====

Võro has preserved the system of [[vowel harmony]] that was present in [[Proto-Finnic]].{{clarify|reason=Võro seems to have more vowels than Proto-Finnic. Didn't it add more vowels to the vowel harmony system of Proto-Finnic?|date=February 2016}} This distinguishes it from Estonian and some other Finnic languages, which have lost it.

The vowel harmony system distinguishes front, back and neutral vowels, much like the system found in Finnish. A word cannot contain both front and back vowels; suffixes automatically adapt the backness of the vowels depending on the type of vowels found in the word it is attached to. Neutral vowels can be combined with either type of vowel, although a word that contains only neutral vowels has front vowel harmony. The only neutral vowel is ''i'', like in [[Votic language|Votic]] but unlike Finnish and Karelian, where ''e'' is also neutral.

The vowel ''y'' is considered a back vowel for harmony purposes, but does not participate in harmony itself, as it does not occur in suffixes and endings.

All Võro consonants (except {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/ʔ/}}) can be palatalized. The [[glottal stop]] (q, [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|[ʔ]}}) is a very common sound in Võro.

==Grammar==

===Nouns===

Endings are shown only in the back vowel harmony variant. The ''e'' of the illative ending does not undergo vowel harmony, so it never changes to ''õ''.

Only the more common endings are shown. There are some unusual/irregular endings that are only found in a few words or word types.

Notes:
* The accusative is not usually considered a separate case in Võro grammars, as it is always identical to either the nominative or the genitive.
* When an ending beginning with ''d'' is attached to a stem ending in an obstruent, it is devoiced to ''t'' automatically.

===Verbs===
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
Some morphological features of the Võro language are considered to be very old. For instance the 3rd person singular of the indicative mood can be either without an ending or, alternatively, with a ''s''-ending:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! style="background:#CFCFCF;" | Võro
! style="background:#CFCFCF;" | Estonian
! style="background:#CFCFCF;" | Finnish
! style="background:#CFCFCF;" | Meaning
|-
| kirota'''s'''
| kirjuta'''b'''
| kirjoitta'''a'''
| writes
|-
| and
| anna'''b'''
| anta'''a'''
| gives
|}

Among the Finnic languages, such double verb conjugation can be found only in the [[South Estonian language|South Estonian]] and [[Karelian language|Karelian]] languages.

====Negation====

Võro has a negative particle that is appended to the end of the verb, whereas standard Estonian and Finnish have a [[negative verb]], which precedes the verb. In Estonian and Finnish, the negative verb ''ei'' (Finnish ''en/et/ei/emme/ette/eivät'') is used in both present and past negation, whereas in Võro the same is expressed by different particles ending with ''-i(q)'' or ''-s'':
{| class="wikitable"

! style="background:#CFCFCF;" | Finnish
! style="background:#CFCFCF;" | Meaning
|-
| saq anna-'''aiq'''
| sa '''ei''' anna
| sinä '''et''' anna
| You don't give
|-
| maq tulõ-'''õiq'''
| ma '''ei''' tule
| minä '''en''' tule
| I don't come
|-
| saq anna-'''as'''

==Language example==
[[File:Wastne Võro keeli A B D raamat.jpg|thumb|An 1885 [[ABC-book]] in Võro language written by [[Johann Hurt]]: "Wastne Wõro keeli ABD raamat"]]

Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in Võro:
:{{lang|vro|Kyik inemiseq sünnüseq avvo ja õiguisi poolõst ütesugumaidsis. Näile om annõt mudsu ja süämetunnistus ja nä piät üts'tõõsõga vele muudu läbi käümä.}}

As comparison the same sentence in Standard Estonian:
:{{lang|et|Kõik inimesed sünnivad vabadena ja võrdsetena oma väärikuselt ja õigustelt. Neile on antud mõistus ja südametunnistus ja nende suhtumist üksteisesse peab kandma vendluse vaim.}}

In Finnish:
:{{lang|fi|Kaikki ihmiset syntyvät vapaina ja tasavertaisina arvoltaan ja oikeuksiltaan. Heille on annettu järki ja omatunto, ja heidän on toimittava toisiaan kohtaan veljeyden hengessä.}}
