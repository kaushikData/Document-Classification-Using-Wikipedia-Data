      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1195">An '''accounting irregularity''' is an [[accounting]] term for practise that does not conform to the normal laws, practises and rules of the accounting profession, having the deliberate intent to deceive or [[defraud]]. Accounting irregularities can consist of intentionally misstating amounts and other information in [[financial statement]]s, or omitting information required to be [[Corporation#Financial disclosure|disclosed]]. Accounting irregularities are commonly distinguished from unintentional mistakes or errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Business governance handbook |author=John W. Hendrikse, Leigh Hendrikse |chapter=8.6 Accounting Irregularities |page=84 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=croQAGwkNi8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSFbpMs4CIQC |title=Accounting irregularities in financial statements |author=[[Benny K B Kwok]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounting irregularities are often committed as a means to an end, for example assets misappropriations may be concealed by using irregular accounting entries and profit overstatements may inflate the year end bonuses to perpetrators.

'''Always already''' is a philosophical term regarding the perception of phenomena by the mind of an observer. The features of a phenomenon that seem to precede any perception of it are said to be "always already" present.

==Development==
"Always already" literally translates the German phrase ''immer schon'' that appears prominently in several 20th century philosophical works, notably [[Martin Heidegger]]'s ''[[Being and Time]]''. The phrase is not specific to philosophy in German, but refers to an action or condition that has continued without any identifiable beginning. Heidegger used the phrase routinely to indicate that [[Dasein]], the human experience of existence, has no beginning apart from the world in which one exists, but is produced in it and by it.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus, Hubert L. and Mark A. Wrathal (2008) ''A Companion to Heidegger'', p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;

On the strength of Heidegger's influence, French and later English philosophers adopted the literal translation of the phrase. In the Marxist tradition, [[Louis Althusser]] observed that "individuals are always-already subjects" within an ideological structure before they perceive themselves as such — indeed, even before birth.&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, Louis (1970) "[https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1970/ideology.htm Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses]"&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 20th century the term spread into various areas of philosophical discourse that include [[literary theory]], [[hermeneutics]] and [[deconstruction]].

'''Ancient Greek verbs''' have four [[grammatical mood|moods]] ([[Realis mood|indicative]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]], [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] and [[Optative (Ancient Greek)|optative]]), three [[Grammatical voice|voices]] ([[Active voice|active]], [[Voice (grammar)#Middle|middle]] and [[Passive voice|passive]]), as well as three [[Grammatical person|persons]] (first, second and third) and three [[Grammatical number|numbers]] (singular, dual and plural).

In the indicative mood there are seven [[Grammatical tense|tenses]]: [[present tense|present]], [[imperfect]], [[future tense|future]] , [[Aorist tense|aorist]] (the equivalent of [[past simple]]),  [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]], [[pluperfect]], and [[future perfect]]. (The last two, especially the future perfect, are rarely used). In the subjunctive and imperative mood, however, there are only three tenses (present, aorist, and perfect). The optative mood, [[infinitive]]s and [[participles]] are found in four tenses (present, aorist, perfect, and future) and all three voices. The distinction of the "tenses" in moods other than the indicative is predominantly one of [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] rather than time.

The different persons of a Greek verb are shown by changing the [[Suffix#Inflectional suffixes|verb-endings]]; for example {{lang|grc|λύω}} ({{grc-transl|λύω}}) "I free", {{lang|grc|λύεις}} ({{grc-transl|λύεις}}) "you free", {{lang|grc|λύει}} ({{grc-transl|λύει}}) "he or she frees", etc. There are three persons in the singular ("I", "you (singular)", "he, she, it"), and three in the plural ("we", "you (plural)", "they"). In addition there are endings for the 2nd and 3rd persons dual ("you two", "they both"), but these are only very rarely used.

A distinction is traditionally made between the so-called ''athematic'' verbs (also called ''mi''-verbs), with endings affixed directly to the root, and the ''thematic'' class of verbs which present a [[thematic vowel|"thematic" vowel]] {{IPA|/o/}} or {{IPA|/e/}} before the ending. The endings are classified into ''primary'' (those used in the present, future, perfect and future perfect of the indicative, as well as in the subjunctive) and ''secondary'' (used in the aorist, imperfect, and pluperfect of the indicative, as well as in the optative).

To make the past tenses of the indicative mood, the vowel {{lang|grc|ε-}} ({{grc-transl|ε-}}), called an "augment", is prefixed to the verb stem, e.g. aorist {{lang|grc|ἔ-λυσα}} ({{grc-transl|ἔ-λυσα}}) "I freed", imperfect {{lang|grc|ἔ-λυον}} ({{grc-transl|ἔ-λυον}}) "I was freeing". This augment is found only in the indicative, not in the other moods or in the infinitive or participle. To make the perfect tense the first consonant is "reduplicated", that is, repeated with the vowel ''e'' ({{lang|grc|λέλυκα}} ({{grc-transl|λέλυκα}}) "I have freed", {{lang|grc|γέγραφα}} ({{grc-transl|γέγραφα}}) "I have written"), or in some cases an augment is used in lieu of reduplication (e.g. {{lang|grc|ηὕρηκα}} ({{grc-transl|ηὕρηκα}}) "I have found"). Unlike the augment of past tenses, this reduplication or augment is retained in all the moods of the perfect tense as well as in the perfect infinitive and participle.

The [[Ancient Greek]] verbal system preserves nearly all the complexities of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE). Ancient Greek also preserves the PIE [[Grammatical voice|middle voice]] and adds a passive voice, with separate forms only in the future and aorist (elsewhere, the middle forms are used).

== Thematic and athematic verbs ==
Ancient Greek verbs can be divided into two groups, the thematic (in which a thematic vowel {{IPA|/e/}} or {{IPA|/o/}} is added before the ending, e.g. {{lang|grc|λύ-ο-μεν}} ({{grc-transl|λύ-ο-μεν}}) "we free"), and the athematic (in which the endings are attached directly to the stem, e.g. {{lang|grc|ἐσ-μέν}} ({{grc-transl|ἐσ-μέν}}) "we are".&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|602, 717|long}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thematic verbs are much more numerous.

=== Thematic verbs ===

==== Active verbs ====
Thematic verbs, in the 1st person singular of the present tense active, end in {{lang|grc|-ω}} ({{grc-transl|-ω}}). These are very numerous, for example, {{lang|grc|λέγω}} ({{grc-transl|λέγω}}) "I say", {{lang|grc|γράφω}} ({{grc-transl|γράφω}}) "I write", {{lang|grc|πέμπω}} ({{grc-transl|πέμπω}}) "I send", etc. The endings of these tend to be regular:
* {{lang|grc|λέγω, λέγεις, λέγει, (λέγετον, λέγετον,) λέγομεν, λέγετε, λέγουσι(ν)}}
: {{grc-transl|λέγω, λέγεις, λέγει, (λέγετον, λέγετον,) λέγομεν, λέγετε, λέγουσι(ν)}}
: I say, you say, he/she/it says, (you two say, they both say,) we say, you ({{abbr|pl.|plural}}) say, they say

The forms in brackets are the dual number, used for two people, and which exists only in the 2nd and 3rd person; it is rather rare, but still used sometimes by authors such as [[Aristophanes]] and [[Plato]]:
* {{lang|grc|Ὅμηρός τε καὶ Ἡσίοδος ταὐτὰ '''λέγετον'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'' 531a&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|Ὅμηρός τε καὶ Ἡσίοδος ταὐτὰ '''λέγετον'''}}.
: Homer and Hesiod '''both say''' the same things.

The present infinitive active of thematic verbs is {{lang|grc|-ειν}} ({{grc-transl|-ειν}}), e.g. {{lang|grc|λέγειν}} ({{grc-transl|λέγειν}}) "to say".

==== Middle verbs ====
Thematic verbs are also found in the middle voice, with the 1st person singular ending {{lang|grc|-ομαι}} ({{grc-transl|-ομαι}}) e.g. {{lang|grc|ἀποκρῑ́νομαι}} ({{grc-transl|ἀποκρῑ́νομαι}}) "I answer", {{lang|grc|γίγνομαι}} ({{grc-transl|γίγνομαι}}) "I become". The endings of the present tense go as follows:
* {{lang|grc|-ομαι, -ει/-ῃ, -εται, (-εσθον, -εσθον), -ομεθα, -εσθε, -ονται}}
: {{grc-transl|-ομαι, -ει/-ῃ, -εται, (-εσθον, -εσθον), -ομεθα, -εσθε, -ονται}}
: I, you (singular), he/she/it, (you two, the two of them), we, you (plural), they

The middle present infinitive is {{lang|grc|-εσθαι}} ({{grc-transl|-εσθαι}}), e.g. {{lang|grc|ἀποκρῑ́νεσθαι}} ({{grc-transl|ἀποκρῑ́νεσθαι}}) "to answer".

Many middle-voice verbs, such as {{lang|grc|ἀποκρῑ́νομαι}} ({{grc-transl|ἀποκρῑ́νομαι}}) "I answer", are ''deponent'', that is to say, they have no corresponding active form. Other middle verbs, such as {{lang|grc|παύομαι}} ({{grc-transl|παύομαι}}) "I cease (doing something)" (intransitive), have a corresponding active form: {{lang|grc|παύω}} ({{grc-transl|παύω}}) "I stop (something)" (transitive).

====Passive verbs====
Passive verbs, in the present, imperfect, and perfect tenses, have exactly the same endings as middle verbs. Examples are {{lang|grc|διώκομαι}} ({{grc-transl|διώκομαι}}) "I am pursued" and {{lang|grc|κελεύομαι}} ({{grc-transl|κελεύομαι}}) "I am ordered (by someone)".

In the aorist tense, however, they differ from middle verbs in that they use the endings {{lang|grc|-σθην}} ({{grc-transl|-σθην}}), {{lang|grc|-θην}} ({{grc-transl|-θην}}), or {{lang|grc|-ην}} ({{grc-transl|-ην}}), for example {{lang|grc|ἐδιώχθην}} ({{grc-transl|ἐδιώχθην}}) "I was pursued", {{lang|grc|ἐκελεύσθην}} ({{grc-transl|ἐκελεύσθην}}) "I was ordered", {{lang|grc|ἐβλάβην}} ({{grc-transl|ἐβλάβην}}) "I was harmed"; whereas middle verbs tend to have an aorist ending in {{lang|grc|-σάμην}} ({{grc-transl|-σάμην}}), {{lang|grc|-άμην}} ({{grc-transl|-άμην}}), or {{lang|grc|-όμην}} ({{grc-transl|-όμην}}), for example {{lang|grc|ἐπαυσάμην}} ({{grc-transl|ἐπαυσάμην}}) "I stopped", {{lang|grc|ἀπεκρινάμην}} ({{grc-transl|ἀπεκρινάμην}}) "I answered",  {{lang|grc|ἐγενόμην}} ({{grc-transl|ἐγενόμην}}) "I became".

==== Contracted verbs ====
A special class of thematic verbs are the contracted verbs. In the dictionary these are entered as ending {{lang|grc|-άω}} ({{grc-transl|-άω}}), {{lang|grc|-έω}} ({{grc-transl|-έω}}) or {{lang|grc|-όω}} ({{grc-transl|-όω}}), for example {{lang|grc|ὁράω}} ({{grc-transl|ὁράω}}) "I see", {{lang|grc|ποιέω}} ({{grc-transl|ποιέω}}) "I do", {{lang|grc|δηλόω}} ({{grc-transl|δηλόω}}) "I show"; but in most cases when they are found in a text the vowel {{lang|grc|α, ε, ο}} ({{grc-transl|α, ε, ο}}) contracts with the ending to make a single vowel. Thus the present tense of {{lang|grc|ὁράω}} ({{grc-transl|ὁράω}}) "I see" goes as follows:
* {{lang|grc|'''ὁρῶ''', ὁρᾷς, ὁρᾷ, (ὁρᾶτον, ὁρᾶτον,) ὁρῶμεν, ὁρᾶτε, ὁρῶσι(ν)}}
: {{grc-transl|ὁρῶ, ὁρᾷς, ὁρᾷ, (ὁρᾶτον, ὁρᾶτον,) ὁρῶμεν, ὁρᾶτε, ὁρῶσι(ν)}}
: I see, you see, he/she/it sees, (you both see, they both see,) we see, you ({{abbr|pl.|plural}}) see, they see

While the present tense of {{lang|grc|ποιέω}} ({{grc-transl|ποιέω}}) "I do" is as follows:
* {{lang|grc|'''ποιῶ''', ποιεῖς, ποιεῖ, (ποιεῖτον, ποιεῖτον,) ποιοῦμεν, ποιεῖτε, ποιοῦσι(ν)}}
: {{grc-transl|ποιῶ, ποιεῖς, ποιεῖ, (ποιεῖτον, ποιεῖτον,) ποιοῦμεν, ποιεῖτε, ποιοῦσι(ν)}}
: I do, you do, he/she/it does, (you both do, they both do,) we do, you (plural) do, they do

And the present tense of {{lang|grc|δηλόω}} ({{grc-transl|δηλόω}}) "I show" is as follows:
* {{lang|grc|'''δηλῶ''', δηλοῖς, δηλοῖ, (δηλοῦτον, δηλοῦτον,) δηλοῦμεν, δηλοῦτε, δηλοῦσι(ν)}}
: {{grc-transl|δηλῶ, δηλοῖς, δηλοῖ, (δηλοῦτον, δηλοῦτον,) δηλοῦμεν, δηλοῦτε, δηλοῦσι(ν)}}
: I show, you show, he/she/it shows, (you both show, they both show,) we show, you (plural) show, they show

The present infinitive active of the three types of contracted verbs is {{lang|grc|ὁρᾶν}} ({{grc-transl|ὁρᾶν}}) "to see", {{lang|grc|ποιεῖν}} ({{grc-transl|ποιεῖν}}), "to do", {{lang|grc|δηλοῦν}} ({{grc-transl|δηλοῦν}}) "to show".

Contracted verbs are also found in the middle and passive voices, e.g. {{lang|grc|ἀφικνέομαι}} ({{grc-transl|ἀφικνέομαι}}) "I arrive" and {{lang|grc|τιμάομαι}} ({{grc-transl|τιμάομαι}}) "I am honoured".

=== Athematic verbs ===

==== Active ====
Athematic verbs have {{lang|grc|-μι}} ({{grc-transl|-μι}}) in the 1st person singular of the present tense, e.g. {{lang|grc|εἰμί}} ({{grc-transl|εἰμί}}) "I am", {{lang|grc|φημί}} ({{grc-transl|φημί}}) "I say", {{lang|grc|δίδωμι}} ({{grc-transl|δίδωμι}}) "I give", {{lang|grc|ἵστημι}} ({{grc-transl|ἵστημι}}) "I stand (transitive)". In the middle voice they end in {{lang|grc|-μαι,}} e.g. {{lang|grc|δύναμαι}} ({{grc-transl|δύναμαι}}) "I am able". The present tense of {{lang|grc|εἶμι}} ({{grc-transl|εἶμι}}) "I (will) go" is generally used with future meaning in the classical period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These verbs present many irregularities in conjugation. For example, the present tense of {{lang|grc|εἰμί}} ({{grc-transl|εἰμί}}) "I am" goes as follows:
* {{lang|grc|'''εἰμί''', εἶ, ἐστί(ν), (ἐστόν, ἐστόν,) ἐσμέν, ἐστέ, εἰσί(ν)}}
: {{grc-transl|εἰμί, εἶ, ἐστί(ν), (ἐστόν, ἐστόν,) ἐσμέν, ἐστέ, εἰσί(ν)}}
: I am, you are, he/she/it is, (you both are, they both are), we are, you (plural) are, they are.

The present tense of the verb {{lang|grc|εἶμι}} ({{grc-transl|εἶμι}}) "I (will) go" is as follows:
* {{lang|grc|'''εἶμι''', εἶ, εἶσι(ν), (ἴτον, ἴτον,) ἴμεν, ἴτε, ἴᾱσι(ν)}}
: {{grc-transl|εἶμι, εἶ, εἶσι(ν), (ἴτον, ἴτον,) ἴμεν, ἴτε, ἴᾱσι(ν)}}
: I will go, you will go, he/she/it will go, (you both will go, they both will go), we will go, you (plural) will go, they will go.

Whereas the present tense of {{lang|grc|δίδωμι}} ({{grc-transl|δίδωμι}}) "I give" goes as follows:
* {{lang|grc|'''δίδωμι''', δίδως, δίδωσι(ν), δίδομεν, δίδοτε, διδόᾱσι(ν)}}
: {{grc-transl|δίδωμι, δίδως, δίδωσι(ν), δίδομεν, δίδοτε, διδόᾱσι(ν)}}
: I give, you give, he/she/it gives, we give, you (plural) give, they give

The dual of this verb, theoretically {{lang|grc|δίδοτον}} ({{grc-transl|δίδοτον}}), is not found.&lt;ref&gt;Perseus PhiloLogic search engine&lt;/ref&gt;

The active infinitive of athematic verbs ends in {{lang|grc|-ναι}} ({{grc-transl|-ναι}}), e.g. {{lang|grc|εἶναι}} ({{grc-transl|εἶναι}}) "to be", {{lang|grc|ἰέναι}} ({{grc-transl|ἰέναι}}) "to go", {{lang|grc|διδόναι}} ({{grc-transl|διδόναι}}) "to give".

==== Middle ====
Athematic verbs are also found in the middle voice, e.g. {{lang|grc|ἵσταμαι}} ({{grc-transl|ἵσταμαι}}) "I stand" or {{lang|grc|δύναμαι}} ({{grc-transl|δύναμαι}}) "I am able", with endings as follows:
* {{lang|grc|-μαι, -σαι, -ται, (-σθον, -σθον), -μεθα, -σθε, -νται}}
: {{grc-transl|-μαι, -σαι, -ται, (-σθον, -σθον), -μεθα, -σθε, -νται}}
: I, you (singular), he/she/it, (you two, the two of them), we, you (plural), they

The infinitive is  {{lang|grc|-σθαι}} ({{grc-transl|-σθαι}}).

==== The verb {{lang|grc|οἶδα}} ({{grc-transl|οἶδα}}) ====
The verb {{lang|grc|οἶδα}} ({{grc-transl|οἶδα}}) "I know", is irregular. Its endings are those of an athematic perfect tense, and go as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|794}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|grc|οἶδα, οἶσθα, οἶδε(ν), (ἴστον, ἴστον,) ἴσμεν, ἴστε, ἴσᾱσι(ν)}}
: {{grc-transl|οἶδα, οἶσθα, οἶδε(ν), (ἴστον, ἴστον,) ἴσμεν, ἴστε, ἴσᾱσι(ν)}}
: I know, you know, he/she/it knows, (you both know, they both know), we know, you (plural) know, they know

The infinitive of {{lang|grc|οἶδα}} ({{grc-transl|οἶδα}}) is {{lang|grc|εἰδέναι}} ({{grc-transl|εἰδέναι}}) "to know".

== Tenses ==

=== The tense system ===
The Ancient Greek verbal system has seven [[grammatical tense|tense]]-[[grammatical aspect|aspect]] forms, traditionally called "tenses" ({{lang|grc|χρόνοι}}, {{grc-transl|χρόνοι}}, singular {{wikt-lang|grc|χρόνος}}, {{grc-transl|χρόνος}}). The temporal distinctions only appear in the [[Realis mood|indicative mood]] as shown on the table below:&lt;ref&gt;Based on table in {{cite book|first1=Hardy|last1=Hansen|first2=Gerald M.|last2=Quinn|title=Greek: An Intensive Course|edition=2nd rev.|date=1992|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] and [[imperative mood]]s, however, only three tenses are used,&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|359}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they distinguish aspect only, not time:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! [[perfective aspect|perfective&lt;br /&gt;aspect]]
! [[imperfective aspect|imperfective&lt;br /&gt;aspect]]
! [[perfect (grammar)|perfect&lt;br /&gt;aspect]]
|-
| '''aorist''' || '''present'''|| '''perfect'''
|}

The [[Optative (Ancient Greek)|optative mood]] likewise uses these three tenses, but there is also a future optative, used mainly to report indirectly what would be a future indicative in direct speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1863c, 2218, 2287, 2231, 2229a|type=short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Greek has no [[perfect progressive]] or [[past perfect progressive]]. Thus, the meaning "he has been doing" is typically expressed with the present tense, and "he had been doing (earlier)" is expressed with the imperfect tense:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1885, 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: {{lang|grc|πολλά γε ἔτη ἤδη '''εἰμὶ''' ἐν τῇ τέχνῃ.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' 317c&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|πολλά γε ἔτη ἤδη '''εἰμὶ''' ἐν τῇ τέχνῃ.}}
: '''I have been''' ({{literal translation}} I am) in the business for many years now.

: {{lang|grc|τὸ πλοῖον ἧκεν ἐν ᾧ '''ἐπῑ́νομεν'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Antiphon]], 5.29&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|τὸ πλοῖον ἧκεν ἐν ᾧ '''ἐπῑ́νομεν'''.}}
: The boat arrived in which '''we had''' (earlier) '''been drinking'''.

For further information on the endings, see [[Ancient Greek grammar (tables)]].

==== Principal parts of verbs ====
Dictionaries of Ancient Greek usually give six principal parts for any verb. For example, for the verb {{lang|grc|παιδεύω}} ({{grc-transl|παιδεύω}}) "I teach, train" the six parts are as follows:
* {{lang|grc|'''παιδεύω''', παιδεύσω, ἐπαίδευσα, πεπαίδευκα, πεπαίδευμαι, ἐπαιδεύθην}}
: {{grc-transl|παιδεύω, παιδεύσω, ἐπαίδευσα, πεπαίδευκα, πεπαίδευμαι, ἐπαιδεύθην}}
: I teach, I will teach, I taught, I have taught, I have been taught, I was taught

The principal parts are these:
* The present tense: {{lang|grc|παιδεύω}} ({{grc-transl|παιδεύω}}) "I teach"
:: Endings: {{lang|grc|-ω -εις -ει (-ετον -ετον) -ομεν -ετε -ουσι(ν)}}
* The future tense: {{lang|grc|παιδεύσω}} ({{grc-transl|παιδεύσω}}) "I will teach"
:: Endings: {{lang|grc|-σω -σεις -σει (-σετον -σετον) -σομεν -σετε -σουσι(ν)}}
* The aorist active tense: {{lang|grc|ἐπαίδευσα}} ({{grc-transl|ἐπαίδευσα}}) "I taught"
:: Endings: {{lang|grc|-σα -σας -σε(ν) (-σατον -σατην) -σαμεν -σατε -σαν}}
* The perfect active tense: {{lang|grc|πεπαίδευκα}} ({{grc-transl|πεπαίδευκα}})  "I have taught"
:: Endings: {{lang|grc|-κα -κας -κε(ν) (-κατον -κατον) -καμεν -κατε -κᾱσι(ν)}}
* The perfect tense middle or passive: {{lang|grc|πεπαίδευμαι}} ({{grc-transl|πεπαίδευμαι}}) "I have been taught"
:: Endings: {{lang|grc|-μαι -σαι -ται (-σθον -σθον) -μεθα -σθε -νται}}
* The aorist passive tense: {{lang|grc|ἐπαιδεύθην}} ({{grc-transl|ἐπαιδεύθην}}) "I was taught"
:: Endings: {{lang|grc|-θην -θης -θη (-θητον -θητην) -θημεν -θητε -θησαν}}

==== Other tenses ====
Other tenses can be formed on the basis of these. For example, the imperfect tense {{lang|grc|ἐπαίδευον}} ({{grc-transl|ἐπαίδευον}}) "I was teaching" is based on the present stem with the addition of the prefix {{lang|grc|ἔ-}} ({{grc-transl|ἔ-}}) (called an "augment", see below), and the pluperfect  {{lang|grc|ἐπεπαιδεύκη}} ({{grc-transl|ἐπεπαιδεύκη}}) "I had taught" is formed from the perfect stem:
* The imperfect tense: {{lang|grc|ἐπαίδευον}} ({{grc-transl|ἐπαίδευον}}) "I was teaching", "I used to teach"
:: Endings: {{lang|grc|-ον -ες -ε(ν) (-ετον -ετην) -ομεν -ετε -ον}}
* The  pluperfect tense: {{lang|grc|ἐπεπαιδεύκη}} ({{grc-transl|ἐπεπαιδεύκη}}) "I had taught"
:: Endings: {{lang|grc|-κη (-κειν) -ης (-κεις) -κει(ν) ( – ) -κεμεν -κετε -κεσαν}}

====Future and aorist without sigma====
Not all verbs have a future tense made with  {{lang|grc|-σ-}} ({{grc-transl|-σ-}}). Some, particularly those whose stem ends in  {{lang|grc|λ, μ, ν, ρ}} ({{grc-transl|λ, μ, ν, ρ}}) such as {{lang|grc|ἀγγέλλω}} ({{grc-transl|ἀγγέλλω}}) "I announce" and {{lang|grc|μένω}} ({{grc-transl|μἐνω}}) "I remain", have a contracted future, with endings like the verb {{lang|grc|ποιέω}} ({{grc-transl|ποιέω}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|535}}&lt;/ref&gt; These same verbs also usually have an aorist without sigma:
* Contracted future: {{lang|grc|ἀγγελῶ}} ({{grc-transl|ἀγγελῶ}}) "I will announce"
:: Endings: {{lang|grc|-ῶ -εῖς -εῖ (-εῖτον -εῖτον) -οῦμεν -εῖτε -οῦσι(ν)}}
* Aorist without sigma: {{lang|grc|ἤγγειλα}} ({{grc-transl|ἤγγειλα}}) "I announced"
:: Endings: {{lang|grc|-α -ας -ε(ν) (-ατον -ατην) -αμεν -ατε -αν}}

====Strong aorist====
Some common verbs, instead of the ordinary (weak) aorist tense ending in {{lang|grc|-σα}}, have an aorist ending in {{lang|grc|-ον}} etc. exactly like the imperfect; this is known as a "strong" aorist or "2nd" aorist. However, it differs from the imperfect in that the stem of the verb is different. Thus the aorist of {{lang|grc|'''φεύγ'''ω}} ({{grc-transl|φεύγω}}) "I flee" is {{lang|grc|ἔ'''φυγ'''ον}} ({{grc-transl|ἔφυγον}}) "I fled", with stem {{lang|grc|φυγ-}} ({{grc-transl|φυγ-}}), contrasting with the imperfect {{lang|grc|ἔ'''φευ'''γον}} ({{grc-transl|ἔφευγον}}), with stem {{lang|grc|φευγ-}} ({{grc-transl|φευγ-}}).

Other strong aorists are {{lang|grc|ἦλθον}} ({{grc-transl|ἦλθον}}) "I came", {{lang|grc|ἔλαβον}} ({{grc-transl|ἔλαβον}}) "I took", {{lang|grc|εἶπον}} ({{grc-transl|εἶπον}}) "I said", {{lang|grc|ἔφαγον}} ({{grc-transl|ἔφαγον}}) "I ate"; and in the middle voice {{lang|grc|ἐγενόμην}} ({{grc-transl|ἐγενόμην}}) "I became" and {{lang|grc|ἀφικόμην}} ({{grc-transl|ἀφικόμην}}) "I arrived".

====Root aorist====
Many verbs have an aorist without the sigma markers and characteristic endings of the regular aorist. Typically these verbs have [[Ancient Greek present progressive markers|present progressive markers]] added to the stem in the present system, so that the basic stem is used in the aorist and in the other aspects. One example is the verb {{lang|grc|βαίνω}} ({{grc-transl|βαίνω}}), "I go", which becomes {{lang|grc|ἔβην}} ({{grc-transl|ἔβην}}).

==== Less regular principal parts ====
However, by no means all Ancient Greek verbs are so regular in their principal parts as {{lang|grc|παιδεύω}} ({{grc-transl|παιδεύω}}). For example, the verb {{lang|grc|λαμβάνω}} ({{grc-transl|λαμβάνω}}) "I take" has the following parts:&lt;ref&gt;[http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html#λαμβάνω Perseus project "Logeion"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|grc|'''λαμβάνω''', λήψομαι, ἔλαβον, εἴληφα, εἴλημμαι, ἐλήφθην}}
: {{grc-transl|λαμβάνω, λήψομαι, ἔλαβον, εἴληφα, εἴλημμαι, ἐλήφθην}}
: I take, I will take, I took, I have taken, I have been taken, I was taken

As can be seen, the stems used ({{lang|grc|λαμβάν-, λήφ-, λαβ-, λήφ-}}) ({{grc-transl|λαμβάν-, λήφ-, λαβ-, λήφ-}}) etc. vary from tense to tense. They all come from the same root, but the stem used in the present tense, {{lang|grc|λαμβάνω}} ({{grc-transl|λαμβάνω}}), has an extra {{lang|grc|μ}} ({{grc-transl|μ}}) and {{lang|grc|αν}} ({{grc-transl|αν}}); in the other tenses the vowel in the root varies between {{lang|grc|α}} ({{grc-transl|α}}) and {{lang|grc|η}} ({{grc-transl|η}}); and the final consonant, {{lang|grc|β}}, changes by assimilation to {{lang|grc|ψ}} ({{grc-transl|ψ}}) or {{lang|grc|μ}} ({{grc-transl|μ}}), or by aspiration&lt;!-- Smyth 569 --&gt; to {{lang|grc|φ}} ({{grc-transl|φ}}).

The verb ({{lang|grc|ἄγω}}) ({{grc-transl|ἄγω}}) "I lead" goes:

* {{lang|grc|'''ἄγω''', ἄξω, ἤγαγον, ἦχα, ἦγμαι, ἤχθην}}
: {{grc-transl|ἄγω, ἄξω, ἤγαγον, ἦχα, ἦγμαι, ἤχθην}}
: I lead, I will lead, I led, I have led, I have been led, I was led

Both of the above verbs have a "strong aorist" or "2nd aorist" ending in {{lang|grc|-ον}} ({{grc-transl|-ον}}) rather than the usual {{lang|grc|-σα}} ({{grc-transl|-σα}}), and the perfect tense has an aspirated consonant {{lang|grc|φ, χ}} ({{grc-transl|φ, χ}}) before the ending instead of {{lang|grc|κ}} ({{grc-transl|κ}}).

The tenses of {{lang|grc|δίδωμι}} ({{grc-transl|δίδωμι}}) "I give" are as follows:
* {{lang|grc|'''δίδωμι''', δώσω, ἔδωκα, δέδωκα, δέδομαι, ἐδόθην}}
: {{grc-transl|δίδωμι, δώσω, ἔδωκα, δέδωκα, δέδομαι, ἐδόθην}}
: I give, I will give, I gave, I have given, I have been given (to someone), I was given (to someone)

The aorist of this verb is irregular, since it ends in {{lang|grc|κα}} ({{grc-transl|κα}}). However, this  {{lang|grc|κ}} ({{grc-transl|κ}}) is found only in the singular, and disappears in the plural, e.g. 3rd {{abbr|pl.|plural}} {{lang|grc|ἔδοσαν}} ({{grc-transl|ἔδοσαν}}) "they gave". The verbs {{lang|grc|'''τίθημι'''}} ({{grc-transl|τίθημι}}) "I put" and {{lang|grc|'''ἵημι'''}} ({{grc-transl|ἵημι}}) "I send" are similar, with aorists {{lang|grc|ἔθηκα}} ({{grc-transl|ἔθηκα}}) 3rd {{abbr|pl.|plural}} {{lang|grc|ἔθεσαν}} ({{grc-transl|ἔθεσαν}}) and {{lang|grc|ἧκα}} ({{grc-transl|ἧκα}}) 3rd {{abbr|pl.|plural}} {{lang|grc|εἷσαν}} ({{grc-transl|εἷσαν}}) respectively.

However, {{lang|grc|ἵστημι}} ({{grc-transl|ἵστημι}}) "I stand (something)" does not follow this pattern and has a different aorist:
* {{lang|grc|'''ἵστημι''', στήσω, ἔστησα}} (trans.)/{{lang|grc|ἔστην}} (intrans.), {{lang|grc|ἕστηκα}} (intrans.), {{lang|grc|ἕσταμαι, ἐστάθην}}
: {{grc-transl|ἵστημι, στήσω, ἔστησα/ἔστην, ἕστηκα, ἕσταμαι, ἐστάθην}}
: I stand (something), I will stand (something), I stood (something)/I stood, I have stood/am standing, I stand, I stood/was stood

==== Verbs using more than one stem ====
In some verbs the principal parts are even more irregular than this, and like the English verb "go, went, been/gone", use different verbs for making different tenses. For example, the verb  {{lang|grc|'''φέρω'''}} ({{grc-transl|φέρω}}) "I bring, I bear" has the following principal parts using the stems of three different verbs:
* {{lang|grc|'''φέρω''', οἴσω, ἤνεγκα/ἤνεγκον, ἐνήνοχα, ἐνήνεγμαι, ἠνέχθην}}
: {{grc-transl|φέρω, οἴσω, ἤνεγκα/ἤνεγκον, ἐνήνοχα, ἐνήνεγμαι, ἠνέχθην}}
: I bring, I will bring, I brought, I have brought, I have been brought, I was brought

{{lang|grc|'''ὁράω'''}} ({{grc-transl|ὁράω}}) "I see" is another verb made from stems from three different roots, namely {{lang|grc|ὁρά}} ({{grc-transl|ὁρά}}), {{lang|grc|ὀπ}} ({{grc-transl|ὀπ}}) and {{lang|grc|ἰδ}} ({{grc-transl|ἰδ}}) (the last of these, which was originally pronounced ϝιδ- (''wid-''), is related to the root of the Latin verb ''video''):
* {{lang|grc|'''ὁράω''', ὄψομαι, εἶδον, ἑόρᾱκα/ἑώρᾱκα, ἑώρᾱμαι/ὦμμαι, ὤφθην}}
: {{grc-transl|ὁράω, ὄψομαι, εἶδον, ἑόρᾱκα/ἑώρᾱκα, ἑώρᾱμαι/ὦμμαι, ὤφθην}}
: I see, I will see, I saw, I have seen, I have been seen, I was seen

{{lang|grc|'''ἔρχομαι'''}} ({{grc-transl|ἔρχομαι}}) "I come" or "I go" is also irregular. This verb has only four principal parts, since there is no passive:
* {{lang|grc|'''ἔρχομαι''', ἐλεύσομαι/εἶμι, ἦλθον, ἐλήλυθα }}
: {{grc-transl|ἔρχομαι, ἐλεύσομαι/εἶμι, ἦλθον, ἐλήλυθα}}
: I come/go, I will come/go, I came/went, I have come/gone

This verb is made more complex by the fact that in [[Attic Greek]] (that is, the dialect of most of the major classical authors), the present tense (apart from the indicative mood), imperfect tense, and future are usually replaced by parts of the irregular verb {{lang|grc|'''εἶμι'''}} ({{grc-transl|εἶμι}}) "I (will) go":&lt;ref&gt;[http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html#ἔρχομαι Liddell, Scott, &amp; Jones ''Greek Lexicon'']&lt;/ref&gt; The indicative of {{lang|grc|εἶμι}} ({{grc-transl|εἶμι}}) is generally used with future significance in the classical period ("I will go") but the other parts such as the infinitive {{lang|grc|ἰέναι}} ({{grc-transl|ἰέναι}}) "to go" are not future in meaning.

==== The past-tense augment ====
The three past tenses (imperfect, aorist, and pluperfect), in the classical period, are made by adding a prefix {{lang|grc|ἐ-}} (''e-''), called an "augment", on the beginning of the verb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|428}}ff&lt;/ref&gt; Thus from {{lang|grc|γράφω}}  ({{grc-transl|γράφω}}) "I write" are made:
* {{lang|grc|'''ἔ'''γραφον}}  ({{grc-transl|'''ἔ'''γραφον}}) "I was writing"
* {{lang|grc|'''ἔ'''γραψα}}  ({{grc-transl|'''ἔ'''γραψα}}) "I wrote"
* {{lang|grc|'''ἐ'''γεγράφη}}  ({{grc-transl|'''ἐ'''γεγράφη}}) "I had written"

This past-tense augment is found only in the indicative mood, not in the subjunctive, infinitive, participle, or other parts of the verb.

When a verb starts with a vowel, the augment usually merges with the vowel to make a long vowel. Thus {{IPA|/e/}} + {{IPA|/a/}} &gt; /ē/, {{IPA|/e/}} + {{IPA|/e/}} &gt; /ē/ (sometimes {{IPA|/ei/}}), {{IPA|/e/}} + {{IPA|/i/}} &gt; /ī/, {{IPA|/e/}} + {{IPA|/o/}} &gt; /ō/ and so on:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|435, 431}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|grc|'''ἦ'''γον}}  ({{grc-transl|'''ἦ'''γον}}) "I was leading", from {{lang|grc|ἄγω}} ({{grc-transl|ἄγω}}) "I lead"
* {{lang|grc|'''εἶ'''χον}}  ({{grc-transl|'''εἶ'''χον}}) "I had, I was holding", from {{lang|grc|ἐχω}} ({{grc-transl|ἐχω}}) "I have, I hold"
* {{lang|grc|'''ᾤ'''κουν}}  ({{grc-transl|'''ᾤ'''κουν}}) "I was living in", from {{lang|grc|οἰκέω}} ({{grc-transl|οἰκέω}}) "I live in"

When a verb starts with a prepositional prefix, the augment usually goes after the prefix (although there are some verbs where it goes before the prefix, or even in both places):
* {{lang|grc|κατ'''έ'''βην}}  ({{grc-transl|κατ'''έ'''βην}}) "I went down", from {{lang|grc|καταβαίνω}} ({{grc-transl|καταβαίνω}}) "I go down"
* {{lang|grc|ἀν'''έῳ'''ξα}}  ({{grc-transl|ἀν'''έῳ'''ξα}})&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristophanes]]&lt;/ref&gt; or {{lang|grc|'''ἤ'''νοιξα}} ({{grc-transl|'''ἤ'''νοιξα}})&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]]&lt;/ref&gt; "I opened", from {{lang|grc|ἀνοίγνυμι}} ({{grc-transl|ἀνοίγνυμι}}) "I open"&lt;ref&gt;[http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html#ἀνοίγνυμι Liddell &amp; Scott ''Greek Lexicon'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In Homer, and occasionally in Herodotus, the augment is sometimes omitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Perfect tenses ====
The perfect tense is formed by repeating the first consonant of the stem with the vowel {{lang|grc|ε}} ({{grc-transl|ε}}). This is known as "reduplication":&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|439}}ff&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|grc|'''γέ'''γραφα}}  ({{grc-transl|'''γέ'''γραφα}}) "I have written", from {{lang|grc|γράφω}} ({{grc-transl|γράφω}}) "I write"
* {{lang|grc|'''βε'''βίωκα}}  ({{grc-transl|'''βε'''βίωκα}}) "I have lived", from {{lang|grc|βιόω}} ({{grc-transl|βιόω}}) "I pass my life"
* {{lang|grc|'''δέ'''δωκα}}  ({{grc-transl|'''δέ'''δωκα}}) "I have given", from {{lang|grc|δίδωμι}} ({{grc-transl|δίδωμι}}) "I give"

When the first consonant of the verb is aspirated ({{lang|grc|θ, φ, χ}}) ({{grc-transl|θ, φ, χ}}), the reduplication is made with the equivalent unaspirated consonant ({{lang|grc|τ, π, κ}}) ({{grc-transl|τ, π, κ}}):&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|441}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|grc|'''τέ'''θνηκα}} ({{grc-transl|'''τέ'''θνηκα}}) "I have died", from {{lang|grc|(ἀπο)θνῄσκω}} ({{grc-transl|[ἀπο]θνῄσκω}}) "I die"
* {{lang|grc|'''πέ'''φευγα}} ({{grc-transl|'''πέ'''φευγα}}) "I have fled", from {{lang|grc|φεύγω}} ({{grc-transl|(φεύγω}}) "I flee"
* {{lang|grc|'''κε'''χάρηκα}} ({{grc-transl|'''κε'''χάρηκα}}) "I am very happy", from {{lang|grc|χαίρω}} ({{grc-transl|χαίρω}}) "I am happy"

When the verb starts with a vowel, {{lang|grc|ζ}} ({{grc-transl|ζ}}) or with a combination of consonants such as {{lang|grc|γν}} ({{grc-transl|γν}}) or {{lang|grc|στρ}} ({{grc-transl|στρ}}), instead of reduplication an augment is used:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|442}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|grc|'''ηὕ'''ρηκα}}  ({{grc-transl|'''ηὕ'''ρηκα}}) "I have found", from {{lang|grc|εὑρίσκω}} ({{grc-transl|εὑρίσκω}}) "I find"
* {{lang|grc|'''ᾕ'''ρηκα}}  ({{grc-transl|'''ᾕ'''ρηκα}}) "I have captured", from {{lang|grc|αἱρέω}} ({{grc-transl|αἱρέω}}) "I capture"
* {{lang|grc|'''ἔ'''γνωκα}} ({{grc-transl|'''ἔ'''γνωκα}}) "I have learned", from {{lang|grc|γιγνώσκω}} ({{grc-transl|γιγνώσκω}}) "I learn" (with the root {{lang|grc|γνω-}}, {{grc-transl|γνω-}})

More complex kinds of reduplication are found in:
* {{lang|grc|'''ἀκ'''ήκοα}}  ({{grc-transl|'''ἀκ'''ήκοα}}) "I have heard", from {{lang|grc|ἀκούω}} ({{grc-transl|ἀκούω}}) "I hear"
* {{lang|grc|'''ἐλ'''ήλυθα}}  ({{grc-transl|'''ἐλ'''ήλυθα}}) "I have come", from {{lang|grc|ἦλθον}} ({{grc-transl|ἦλθον}}) "I came"

Unlike the past-tense augment, this reduplication or perfect-tense augment is found in every part of the perfect tense, including the infinitive and participles.

=== Meanings of the tenses ===
The meanings of the tenses are as follows:
==== The present tense ====
The present tense (Greek {{lang|grc|ἐνεστώς}} ({{grc-transl|ἐνεστώς}}) "standing within") can be imperfective or perfective, and be translated "I do (now)", "I do (regularly)", "I am doing (now)":&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1875}}ff&lt;/ref&gt;

: {{lang|grc|'''ὄμνῡμι''' πάντας θεούς}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Agesilaus (Xenophon)|Agesilaus]]'' 5.5, ''[[Symposium (Xenophon)|Symposium]]'' 4.11&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|'''ὄμνῡμι''' πάντας θεούς}}.
: '''I swear''' by all the gods!

: {{lang|grc|τὸν ἄνδρα '''ὁρῶ'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' 1.8.26&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|τὸν ἄνδρα '''ὁρῶ'''.}}
: '''I see''' the man!

: {{lang|grc|ᾱ̓εὶ ταὐτὰ '''λέγεις''', ὦ Σώκρατες.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'' 490e&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ᾱ̓εὶ ταὐτὰ '''λέγεις''', ὦ Σώκρατες.}}
: '''You are always saying''' the same things, Socrates!

: {{lang|grc|“ὦ Σώκρατες,” ἔφη, “ἐγρήγορας ἢ '''καθεύδεις''';”}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' 310b&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|“ὦ Σώκρατες,” ἔφη, “ἐγρήγορας ἢ '''καθεύδεις'''?”}}
: "O Socrates", he said, "have you woken up, or '''are you sleeping'''?"

The present tense is frequently used in historical narrative, especially to describe exciting moments:
: {{lang|grc|'''ῑ̔́ετο''' ἐπ’ αὐτὸν καὶ '''τιτρώσκει'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' 1.8.26&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|'''ῑ̔́ετο''' ἐπ’ αὐτὸν καὶ '''τιτρώσκει'''.}}
: He '''hurls himself''' at him and '''wounds''' him.

==== Imperfect tense ====
The imperfect tense (Greek {{lang|grc|παρατατικός}} ({{grc-transl|παρατατικός}}) "for prolonging", from {{lang|grc|παρατείνω}} ({{grc-transl|παρατείνω}}) "prolong") is used in the indicative mood only. It often indicates a continuing situation in the past, rather than an event. It can be translated as "was doing", "used to do", "would do", etc., referring to either a progressive, habitual, or continual situation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1889}}ff&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|ὁ λοχαγὸς ᾔδει ὅπου '''ἔκειτο''' ἡ ἐπιστολή.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Cyropaedia]]'' 2.2.9&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ὁ λοχαγὸς ᾔδει ὅπου '''ἔκειτο''' ἡ ἐπιστολή.}}
: The captain knew where the letter '''was lying'''.

: {{lang|grc|'''ἐστρατοπεδεύοντο''' ἑκάστοτε ἀπέχοντες ἀλλήλων παρασάγγην καὶ πλέον.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' 2.4.10&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|'''ἐστρατοπεδεύοντο''' ἑκάστοτε ἀπέχοντες ἀλλήλων παρασάγγην καὶ πλέον.}}
: Every night the (two armies) would camp a [[parasang]] or more apart from each other.

: {{lang|grc|ταῦτα πολὺν χρόνον οὕτως '''ἐγίγνετο'''}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Lysias]], 1.10&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ταῦτα πολὺν χρόνον οὕτως '''ἐγίγνετο'''.}}
: These things '''carried on''' like this for long time.

Often "began doing" is a possible translation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|συμβαλόντες τᾱ̀ς ἀσπίδας '''ἐωθοῦντο''', '''ἐμάχοντο''', '''ἀπέκτεινον''', '''ἀπέθνῃσκον'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Agesilaus (Xenophon)|Agesilaus]]'' 2.12&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|συμβαλόντες τᾱ̀ς ἀσπίδας '''ἐωθοῦντο''', '''ἐμάχοντο''', '''ἀπέκτεινον''', '''ἀπέθνῃσκον'''.}}
: Throwing together their shields, they '''began shoving''', '''fighting''', '''killing''', and '''dying'''.

: {{lang|grc|μετὰ τὸ δεῖπνον τὸ παιδίον '''ἐβόα'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Lysias]], 1.11&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|μετὰ τὸ δεῖπνον τὸ παιδίον '''ἐβόα'''.}}
: After dinner the baby '''began crying'''.

: {{lang|grc|ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἕως ἐγένετο, '''διέβαινον''' τὴν γέφῡραν.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' 2.4.24&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἕως ἐγένετο, '''διέβαινον''' τὴν γέφῡραν.}}
: And when dawn came, '''they began crossing''' the bridge.

As noted above, the imperfect can also mean "had been doing", referring to a situation which existed earlier than the time of the main verb:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|ἀπέστειλαν τὰς ναῦς ᾱ̔́σπερ '''παρεσκευάζοντο'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], 2.23.2&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἀπέστειλαν τὰς ναῦς ᾱ̔́σπερ '''παρεσκευάζοντο'''.}}
: They sent off the ships which '''they had been preparing'''.

: {{lang|grc|εἰσήγαγον ἰᾱτρὸν ᾧ πολλὰ ἔτη '''ἐχρώμην'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]], 47.67&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|εἰσήγαγον ἰᾱτρὸν ᾧ πολλὰ ἔτη '''ἐχρώμην'''}}
: I brought in a doctor that '''I had been using''' for many years.

However, although the imperfect usually describes a situation, it is often used in narrative where English would use a simple past, especially with verbs meaning "send", "go", "say", and "order":&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1891, 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|ἐς τᾱ̀ς Ἀθήνᾱς ἄγγελον '''ἔπεμπον'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], 2.6.1&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἐς τᾱ̀ς Ἀθήνᾱς ἄγγελον '''ἔπεμπον'''.}}
: They '''sent off''' a messenger to Athens.

: {{lang|grc|Μίνδαρος κατιδὼν τὴν μάχην ... '''ἐβοήθει'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Hellenica]]'' 1.1.4&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|Μίνδαρος κατιδὼν τὴν μάχην ... '''ἐβοήθει'''.}}
: Mindaros, seeing the battle from afar, '''set off to help'''.

: {{lang|grc|'''ἐκέλευον''' συνδειπνεῖν ... '''ἐδειπνοῦμεν''' ... ἀπιὼν '''ᾤχετο''' ... '''ἐκάθευδον'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Lysias]], 1.23&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|'''ἐκέλευον''' συνδειπνεῖν ... '''ἐδειπνοῦμεν''' ... ἀπιὼν '''ᾤχετο''' ...'''ἐκάθευδον'''.}}
: '''I invited''' him to join me for dinner ... '''we sat down to dinner''' ... '''he went''' away ... '''I went to sleep'''.

The distinction between imperfect and aorist in the above examples can be seen not so much in terms of [[Imperfective aspect|perfectivity]] vs. imperfectivity, as in terms of [[telicity]] vs. atelicity.&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{Smyth|1891}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aorist {{lang|grc|ἐδειπνήσαμεν}} ({{grc-transl|ἐδειπνήσαμεν}}) would mean "we finished dinner" and would be a telic verb, implying that the action was carried through to its end, whereas the imperfect {{lang|grc|ἐδειπνοῦμεν}} ({{grc-transl|ἐδειπνοῦμεν}}) would mean "we began eating dinner" and would be atelic, implying that the action was started but not necessarily completed. Similarly the aorist {{lang|grc|ἔπεισα}} ({{grc-transl|ἔπεισα}}) means "I successfully persuaded", whereas the imperfect {{lang|grc|ἔπειθον}} ({{grc-transl|ἔπειθον}}) means "I urged" or "I attempted to persuade":&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Albert |last=Rijksbaron |title=The Syntax and Semantics of the Verb in Classical Greek: An Introduction |edition=3rd |publisher=The [[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago and London |date=2006 |at=§&amp;nbsp;6.2.4 |mode=cs1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: {{lang|grc|'''ἔπειθον''' ἀποτρέπεσθαι· οἱ δ’ οὐχ ὑπήκουον.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' 7.3.7&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|'''ἔπειθον''' ἀποτρέπεσθαι· οἱ δ’ οὐχ ὑπήκουον.}}
: '''They urged''' them to turn back, but they wouldn't listen.

Another meaning of the imperfect indicative is to refer to unreal (counterfactual) situations in present or past time. To give the meaning "would", the particle {{lang|grc|ἄν}} ({{grc-transl|ἄν}}) is added:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|2304}}ff&lt;/ref&gt;

: {{lang|grc|ταῦτα δὲ οὐκ ἂν '''ἐδύναντο''' ποιεῖν, εἰ μὴ διαίτῃ μετρίᾳ '''ἐχρῶντο'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Cyropaedia]]'' 1.2.16&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ταῦτα δὲ οὐκ ἂν '''ἐδύναντο''' ποιεῖν, εἰ μὴ διαίτῃ μετρίᾳ '''ἐχρῶντο'''.}}
: '''They wouldn't be able''' to do this if '''they weren't following''' a temperate diet.

==== Future tense ====
The future tense (Greek {{lang|grc|μέλλων}} ({{grc-transl|μέλλων}}) "going to be") describes an event or a state of affairs that will happen in the future. For example, it can be something promised or predicted:

: {{lang|grc|'''ἄξω''' ῡ̔μᾶς εἰς τὴν Τρῳάδα.}} &lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' 5.6.23&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|'''ἄξω''' ῡ̔μᾶς εἰς τὴν Τρῳάδα.}}
: '''I will lead''' you to the Troad.

: {{lang|grc|'''ἥξω''' παρὰ σὲ αὔριον, ἐὰν θεὸς ἐθέλῃ.}} &lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''La.'' 201c&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|'''ἥξω''' παρὰ σὲ αὔριον, ἐὰν θεὸς ἐθέλῃ.}}
: '''I will come''' to see you tomorrow, if God is willing.

It can also be used after {{lang|grc|ὅπως}} ({{grc-transl|ὅπως}}) for strong commands and prohibitions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|ὅπως ταῦτα μηδεὶς ἀνθρώπων '''πεύσεται'''.}} &lt;ref&gt;[[Lysias]], 1.21&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ὅπως ταῦτα μηδεὶς ἀνθρώπων '''πεύσεται'''.}}
: Make sure that no one '''finds out''' about these things.

==== Aorist tense ====
{{main article|Aorist (Ancient Greek)}}
The [[aorist]] tense (Greek {{wikt-lang|grc|ἀόριστος}} ({{grc-transl|ἀόριστος}}) "unbounded" or "indefinite") describes a finished action in the past.
: {{lang|grc|'''κατέβην''' χθὲς εἰς Πειραιᾶ.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]]'' 327a&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|'''κατέβην''' χθὲς εἰς Πειραιᾶ.}}
: '''I went down''' yesterday to Piraeus.

Often in narrative it is found mixed with present and imperfect tenses:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1908, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|'''ἧκεν''' ἐκείνη καὶ τὴν θύρᾱν '''ἀνέῳξεν'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Lysias]], 1.14&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|'''ἧκεν''' ἐκείνη καὶ τὴν θύρᾱν '''ἀνέῳξεν'''.}}
: She '''came back''' (''imperfect'') and '''opened''' (''aorist'') the door.

: {{lang|grc|'''ἐφύλαττεν''' ἕως '''ἐξηῦρεν''' ὅ τι εἴη τὸ αἴτιον.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Lysias]], 1.15&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|'''ἐφύλαττεν''' ἕως '''ἐξηῦρεν''' ὅ τι εἴη τὸ αἴτιον.}}
: She '''kept watch''' (''imperfect'') until she '''found out''' (''aorist'') what the cause was.

Often an aorist is equivalent to an English pluperfect tense, for example after {{lang|grc|ἐπεί}} ({{grc-transl|ἐπεί}}) "when" or in relative clauses in sentences such as the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|ἐπεὶ δ’ '''ἐδείπνησαν''', ἐξῆγε τὸ στράτευμα.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Cyropaedia]]'' 4.2.9&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἐπεὶ δ’ '''ἐδείπνησαν''', ἐξῆγε τὸ στράτευμα.}}
: When '''they had dined''', he led the army out.

: {{lang|grc|ἐκέλευσέ με τὴν ἐπιστολὴν ἣν '''ἔγραψα''' δοῦναι.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Cyropaedia]]'' 2.2.9&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἐκέλευσέ με τὴν ἐπιστολὴν ἣν '''ἔγραψα''' δοῦναι}}
: He ordered me to give him the letter which '''I had written.'''

Another meaning of the aorist indicative is to refer to unreal (counterfactual) events in past time. To give the meaning "would", the particle {{lang|grc|ἄν}} ({{grc-transl|ἄν}}) is added:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|2305}}ff&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|οὐκ '''ἂν ἐποίησεν''' ταῦτα, εἰ μὴ ἐγὼ αὐτὸν '''ἐκέλευσα'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' 6.6.15&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|οὐκ '''ἂν ἐποίησεν''' ταῦτα, εἰ μὴ ἐγὼ αὐτὸν '''ἐκέλευσα'''.}}
: '''He would not have done''' this, if '''I had not ordered''' him.

==== Perfect tense ====
The perfect tense (Greek {{lang|grc|παρακείμενος}} ({{grc-transl|παρακείμενος}}) "lying nearby"), much as the English perfect tense, often describes a recent event of which the present result is important:
: {{lang|grc|'''ἀκηκόατε''', '''ἑωράκατε'''· δικάζετε}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Lysias]], 12.100&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|'''ἀκηκόατε''', '''ἑωράκατε'''· δικάζετε}}
: '''You have heard''' and '''you have seen''' (the evidence); now make your decision.

It can also, like the English perfect, be used experientially, of something that has often or always happened in the past:
: {{lang|grc|ὑμεῖς ἐμοῦ πολλάκις '''ἀκηκόατε''' λέγοντος}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'' 31c&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ὑμεῖς ἐμοῦ πολλάκις '''ἀκηκόατε''' λέγοντος}}
: '''You have''' often '''heard''' me speaking.

In some verbs the perfect tense can be translated by a present tense in English, e.g. {{lang|grc|μέμνημαι}} ({{grc-transl|μέμνημαι}}) "I remember", {{lang|grc|ἕστηκα}} ({{grc-transl|ἕστηκα}}) "I am standing"/"I stand", {{lang|grc|κέκτημαι}} ({{grc-transl|κέκτημαι}}) "I possess", {{lang|grc|οἶδα}} ({{grc-transl|οἶδα}}) "I know":&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|ἡ στήλη παρ’ ᾗ '''ἕστηκας''' χιλίᾱς δραχμᾱ̀ς κελεύει ὀφείλειν}}&lt;ref&gt;Andocides, 1.116&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἡ στήλη παρ’ ᾗ '''ἕστηκας''' χιλίᾱς δραχμᾱ̀ς κελεύει ὀφείλειν}}
: The inscribed stone beside which '''you are standing''' orders that you owe 1000 drachmas.

==== Pluperfect tense ====
The pluperfect tense (Greek {{lang|grc|ὑπερσυντέλικος}} ({{grc-transl|ὑπερσυντέλικος}}) "more than completed"), like the Imperfect, is used only in the indicative mood. It refers to a situation that existed due to events that had taken place at an earlier time:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|μάλα ἤχθοντο ὅτι οἱ Ἕλληνες '''ἐπεφεύγεσαν'''· ὃ οὔπω πρόσθεν '''ἐπεποιήκεσαν'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' 5.4.18&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|μάλα ἤχθοντο ὅτι οἱ Ἕλληνες '''ἐπεφεύγεσαν'''· ὃ οὔπω πρόσθεν '''ἐπεποιήκεσαν'''.}}
: They were very annoyed that the Greeks '''had fled''' – something which they '''had''' never '''done''' before.

However, the pluperfect is much less frequently used in Greek than in English, since after conjunctions such as {{lang|grc|ἐπεί}} ({{grc-transl|ἐπεί}}) "when", usually the aorist is used:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1943}}; but cf. Xen. ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' 5.4.18&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|ἐπεὶ δ’ '''ἐδείπνησαν''', ἐξῆγε τὸ στράτευμα.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Cyropaedia]]'' 4.2.9&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἐπεὶ δ’ '''ἐδείπνησαν''', ἐξῆγε τὸ στράτευμα.}}
: And when '''they had had dinner''' (''aorist''), he began leading out the army.

==== Future perfect tense ====
The future perfect tense (Greek {{lang|grc|συντελεσμένος μέλλων}} ({{grc-transl|συντελεσμένος μέλλων}}) "going to be completed") is rarely used. In the active voice only two verbs ({{lang|grc|τεθνήξω}} ({{grc-transl|τεθνήξω}})  "I will be dead" and {{lang|grc|ἕστηξα}} ({{grc-transl|ἕστηξα}}) "I will be standing") have a separate form for the future perfect tense,&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|584}}&lt;/ref&gt; though a compound ("periphrastic") tense can be made with a perfect participle, e.g {{lang|grc|ἐγνωκὼς ἔσται}} ({{grc-transl|ἐγνωκὼς ἔσται}})&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]], 1.14&lt;/ref&gt; "he is going to have realised"; but even this is extremely rare. It is more common in the passive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1955}}ff&lt;/ref&gt; It describes a future state that will result from a finished action:
: {{lang|grc|φίλος ἡμῖν οὐδεὶς '''λελείψεται'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' 2.4.5&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|φίλος ἡμῖν οὐδεὶς '''λελείψεται'''.}}
: No friend '''will have been left''' for us.

== Moods ==
There are four moods ({{lang|grc|ἐγκλίσεις}} {{grc-transl|ἐγκλίσεις}} "bendings" or "leanings"):

=== Indicative ===
(Greek {{lang|grc|ὁριστική}} {{grc-transl|ὁριστική}} "for defining", from {{lang|grc|ὁρίζω}} {{grc-transl|ὁρίζω}} "I define").

The indicative is the form of the verb used for ordinary statements of fact:
: {{lang|grc|'''ἀπέκτεινε''' τὸν ἄνδρα}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antiphon]], 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|'''ἀπέκτεινε''' τὸν ἄνδρα}}.
: '''He killed''' the man.

To make the negative of the indicative, {{lang|grc|οὐ}} ({{grc-transl|οὐ}}) or, before a vowel, {{lang|grc|οὐκ}} ({{grc-transl|οὐκ}}) is added before the verb:
: {{lang|grc|'''οὐκ ἐδύνατο''' καθεύδειν}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' 3.1.11&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|'''οὐκ ἐδύνατο''' καθεύδειν}}.
: '''He was not able''' to sleep.

The imperfect and aorist indicative can also sometimes refer to unreal (counterfactual) situations in present or past time ("would be doing", "should be doing", "would have done" etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|2303, 1774}}&lt;/ref&gt; (For further examples see above.)
: {{lang|grc|τί σιγᾷς; οὐκ '''ἐχρῆν''' σιγᾶν}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]], ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'' 295&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|τί σιγᾷς; οὐκ '''ἐχρῆν''' σιγᾶν}}.
: Why are you keeping quiet? You '''should not be''' keeping quiet.

=== Subjunctive ===
{{main article|Subjunctive (Ancient Greek)}}
(Greek {{lang|grc|ὑποτακτική}} {{grc-transl|ὑποτακτική}} "for arranging underneath", from {{lang|grc|ὑποτάσσω}} {{grc-transl|ὑποτάσσω}} "I arrange underneath").

The subjunctive generally has the letters {{lang|grc|ω}} ({{grc-transl|ω}}) or {{lang|grc|η}} ({{grc-transl|η}}) in the ending.

It is often used when the meaning is ''may'', for example in purpose clauses, especially those referring to present or future time:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|2193}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|λέγε, ἵνα '''ἀκούω'''}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Lysis (dialogue)|Lysis]]'' 211b&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|λέγε, ἵνα '''ἀκούω'''}}
: Speak, so that '''I may hear''' ({{literal translation}} so that I may be hearing).

The above example uses the present subjunctive, but the aorist subjunctive is equally correct, with a slightly different shade of meaning:
: {{lang|grc|λέγε, ἵνα '''ἀκούσω'''}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' 263e&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|λέγε, ἵνα '''ἀκούσω'''}}
: Speak, so that '''I may hear''' ({{literal translation}} so that I may hear (straightaway)).

Another very common use of the subjunctive is in indefinite subordinate clauses following a conjunction such as {{lang|grc|ἐᾱ́ν}} ({{grc-transl|ἐᾱ́ν}}) "if (it may be that)", {{lang|grc|ὅταν}} ({{grc-transl|ὅταν}}) "whenever", {{lang|grc|ὃς ἄν}} ({{grc-transl|ὃς ἄν}}) "whoever",  {{lang|grc|ἕως ἄν}} ({{grc-transl|ἕως ἄν}}) "until such time as" etc., referring to present or future time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1768, 2297, 2401}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used with the subjunctive, such conjunctions are always joined with the particle ἄν (''an''):
: {{lang|grc|λέγε, ἕως ἂν οἴκαδε ὥρᾱ '''ᾖ''' ἀπιέναι}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Lysis (dialogue)|Lysis]]'' 211b&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|λέγε, ἕως ἂν οἴκαδε ὥρᾱ '''ᾖ''' ἀπιέναι}}
: Speak, until '''it is''' time to go home.

The subjunctive can also be used of something that it is suggested "should" happen, for example in exhortations, deliberative questions, and negative commands such as the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1797, 1805, 1841}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|ἄγε νῡν, '''ἴωμεν'''}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristophanes]], ''[[Peace (play)|Peace]]'' 850&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἄγε νῡν, '''ἴωμεν'''}}
: Come now, '''let's go'''.

: {{lang|grc|'''εἴπωμεν''' ἢ '''σῑγῶμεν''';}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]], ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'' 758&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|'''εἴπωμεν''' ἢ '''σῑγῶμεν''';}}
: '''Should we speak''' (''aorist'') or '''should we remain silent''' (''present'')?

: {{lang|grc|μὴ '''θαυμάσῃς'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' 238d&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|μὴ '''θαυμάσῃς'''}}.
: Don't '''be surprised'''.

The negative of the subjunctive, as in the above example, is μὴ (''mē'').

=== Optative ===
{{main article|Optative (Ancient Greek)}}

(Greek: {{lang|grc|εὐκτική}} {{grc-transl|εὐκτική}} "for wishing", from {{lang|grc|εὔχομαι}} {{grc-transl|εὔχομαι}} "I wish").

The [[Optative (Ancient Greek)|optative mood]] can generally be recognised because it has the letters οι (''oi''), αι (''ai'') or ει (''ei'') in the ending.

One use of the optative mood is in conditional sentences referring to a hypothetical situation in the future. The particle ἄν (''an'') is added in the main clause to give the meaning "would":&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|2329}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|ἡδέως ἂν '''λάβοιμι''', εἰ '''διδοίη'''}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Cyropaedia]]''3.2.28&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἡδέως ἂν '''λάβοιμι''', εἰ '''διδοίη'''}}
: '''I would''' gladly '''take''', if '''he were to give'''.

However, the optative mood is not used in sentences referring to a hypothetical situation in the present or past; in such sentences the optative is replaced by the imperfect, aorist, or pluperfect indicative, with {{lang|grc|ἄν}} (''an'') in the main clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|2303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The optative mood is also used in reported speech in past time:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|2619}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|εἶπεν ὅτι θῦσαί τι '''βούλοιτο'''}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' 7.2.14&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|εἶπεν ὅτι θῦσαί τι '''βούλοιτο'''}}
: He said that '''he wished''' to make a sacrifice.

Just as the subjunctive is used after a conjunction meaning "whenever", "until such time as" etc. referring to present or future time, so the optative can be used in similar clauses referring to repeated events in past time. However, in this case the particle ἄν (''an'') is not added to the conjunction:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|2414}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|ἐθήρευεν, ὁπότε γυμνάσαι '''βούλοιτο''' ἑαυτόν.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' 1.2.7&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἐθήρευεν, ὁπότε γυμνάσαι '''βούλοιτο''' ἑαυτόν.}}
: He used to hunt, whenever '''he wished''' to take exercise.

The optative can also be used for wishes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1814}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|ὃ μὴ '''γένοιτο'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]], 25.30 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ὃ μὴ '''γένοιτο'''.}}
: Which '''may it''' not '''happen'''!

The optative can also be used in purpose clauses in past time, and after verbs of fearing in past time:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|2196, 2221}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|ἐκάλεσε γάρ τις αὐτὸν ὅπως '''ἴδοι''' τὰ ἱερά.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' 2.1.9&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἐκάλεσε γάρ τις αὐτὸν ὅπως '''ἴδοι''' τὰ ἱερά.}}
: Someone had summoned him so that '''he could see''' the sacrificial entrails.

: {{lang|grc|ἔδεισαν οἱ Ἕλληνες αὐτὸν μὴ τύραννος '''γένοιτο'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Hellenica]]'' 6.4.32&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἔδεισαν οἱ Ἕλληνες αὐτὸν μὴ τύραννος '''γένοιτο'''.}}
: The Greeks were afraid of him in case '''he might become''' a tyrant.

However, some authors, such as Herodotus and [[Thucydides]], prefer to use the subjunctive in such clauses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|2197, 2225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imperative ===
(Greek: {{lang|grc|προστακτική}} {{grc-transl|προστακτική}} "for commanding", from {{wikt-lang|grc|προστάσσω}} {{grc-transl|προστάσσω}} "I command").

The present imperative is used for general commands:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1864}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|τοὺς μὲν θεοὺς '''φοβοῦ''', τοὺς δὲ γονεῖς '''τῑ́μᾱ'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Isocrates]], 1.16&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|τοὺς μὲν θεοὺς '''φοβοῦ''', τοὺς δὲ γονεῖς '''τῑ́μᾱ'''}}.
: '''Fear''' the gods, and '''honour''' your parents.

The aorist imperative is used when the speaker wishes something done at once:
: {{lang|grc|'''δότε''' μοι ξίφος ὅπως τάχιστα}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristophanes]], ''[[The Wasps]]'' 165&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|'''δότε''' μοι ξίφος ὅπως τάχιστα}}.
: '''Give''' me a sword as quickly as possible!

It is also possible in Greek to have a 3rd person imperative, as in the following examples:
: {{lang|grc|'''ἀπαγέτω''' τις αὐτὴν οἴκαδε.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Phaedo (dialogue)|Phaedo]]'' 60a&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|'''ἀπαγέτω''' τις αὐτὴν οἴκαδε}}
: Someone '''take''' her '''away''' home (at once).

: {{lang|grc|θεοὶ ἡμῖν μάρτυρες '''ἔστων'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Cyropaedia]]'' 4.6.10&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|θεοὶ ἡμῖν μάρτυρες '''ἔστων'''}}.
: The gods '''be''' witnesses for us.

The imperative mood can also be used in the perfect tense, as the following example shows:
: {{lang|grc|κέντρῳ τῷ Α, διαστήματι τῷ ΑΒ, '''γεγράφθω''' κύκλος}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Euclid]], ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' 1.1&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|κέντρῳ τῷ Α, διαστήματι τῷ ΑΒ, '''γεγράφθω''' κύκλος}}
: Let a circle '''have been drawn''' with centre A, radius AB.

=== Infinitives ===
{{see|Infinitive (Ancient Greek)}}
(Greek: {{lang|grc|ἀπαρέμφατος}} ''aparémphatos'' "not indicated").

==== Forms of the infinitive (active) ====
The infinitive is found in all three voices, and in the present, aorist, future, and perfect tenses. The four infinitives of the active voice of the verb λύω (''lúō'') "I free" are as follows:
* Present : {{lang|grc|λῡ́ειν}} (''lúein'') "to free" (in general)
* Future : {{lang|grc|λῡ́σειν}} (''lúsein'') "to be going to free"
* Aorist : {{lang|grc|λῦσαι}} (''lûsai'') "to free" (at once)
* Perfect : {{lang|grc|λελυκέναι}} (''lelukénai'') "to have freed"

Many commonly used verbs, instead of an aorist infinitive in {{lang|grc|-σαι}} (''-sai''), have one ending in {{lang|grc|-εῖν}} (''-eîn'') (with a circumflex accent) instead. This is called the "strong aorist" or "2nd aorist":
* (Strong) aorist : {{lang|grc|λαβεῖν}} (''labeîn'') "to take"

Root aorists take a different infinitive:
* (Root) aorist : {{lang|grc|βῆναι}} ({{grc-transl|βῆναι}}) "to go"

Contracting verbs have a present infinitive ending in {{lang|grc|-ᾶν}} (''-ân''), {{lang|grc|-εῖν }}(''-eîn'') or {{lang|grc|-οῦν}} (''-oûn''):&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|385}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Present : {{lang|grc|ὁρᾶν}} (''horân'') "to see"
* Present : {{lang|grc|ποιεῖν}} (''poieîn'') "to do"
* Present : {{lang|grc|δηλοῦν}} (''dēloûn'') "to show"

Verbs ending in -μι (''-mi''), such as {{lang|grc|δίδωμι}} (''dídōmi'') "I give", have present and aorist infinitives which end in {{lang|grc|-ναι}} (''-nai''):&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|416}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Present : {{lang|grc|διδόναι}} (''didónai'') "to give" (in general)
* Aorist : {{lang|grc|δοῦναι}} (''doûnai'') "to give" (now)

The irregular verb {{lang|grc|οἶδα}} (''oîda'') "I know" also has an infinitive ending in {{lang|grc|-ναι}} (''-nai''):&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|794}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Present : {{lang|grc|εἰδέναι}} (''eidénai'') "to know"

==== Uses ====
The infinitive is often used after verbs with meanings such as "he wanted", "he ordered", "he tried", "it is necessary", "he is able" etc. much as in English:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1991, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|ἐκέλευσεν αὐτοὺς '''ἀπελθεῖν'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], 6.58.1&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἐκέλευσεν αὐτοὺς '''ἀπελθεῖν'''.}}
: He ordered them '''to go aside''' (''aorist'').

It can also be used for indirect speech after certain verbs such as {{lang|grc|φημί}} ({{grc-transl|φημί}} ) "I say" or {{lang|grc|νομίζω}} ({{grc-transl|νομίζω}}) "I think".&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|2016, 2017, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The subject of the infinitive, if it is different from the subject of the main verb, is put in the accusative case. When the statement is negative, the word {{lang|grc|οὐ}} (''ou'') "not" goes in front of {{lang|grc|φημί}} ({{grc-transl|φημί}}).
: {{lang|grc|οὔ φᾱσιν '''εἶναι''' ἄλλην ὁδόν.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' 4.1.21&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|οὔ φᾱσιν '''εἶναι''' ἄλλην ὁδόν.}}
: "They say '''there is''' no other way" ({{literal translation}} "they do not say there to be another way")

In Greek an infinitive is also often used with the neuter definite article in various constructions. In this case it is similar in meaning to the English verbal noun in "-ing":&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|2025, 2032}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|ἐπέσχομεν τοῦ '''δακρύειν'''}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Phaedo (dialogue)|Phaedo]]'' 117e&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἐπέσχομεν τοῦ '''δακρύειν'''}}.
: We refrained from '''weeping'''.

=== Participles ===
{{see|Participle (Ancient Greek)}}
Participles were given the name {{lang|grc|μετοχή}} ''metokhḗ'' "sharing" by Greek grammarians, because they share the characteristics of both adjectives and verbs. Like adjectives, they have gender, case, and number and agree with the nouns that they modify, and, like verbs, they have tense and voice.

====Forms of the participle====
Participles exist for all three voices in the present, aorist, future, and perfect tenses. Typical endings for the {{abbr|masc.|masculine}} {{abbr|sg.|singular}}, {{abbr|fem.|feminine}} {{abbr|sg.|singular}}, and {{abbr|masc.|masculine}} {{abbr|pl.|plural}} are as follows:

Active:
*{{lang|grc|-ων, -ουσα, -οντες}} ({{grc-transl|-ων, -ουσα, -οντες}}) – present
*{{lang|grc|-σων, -σουσα, -σοντες}} ({{grc-transl|σων, -σουσα, -σοντες}}) – future
*{{lang|grc|-ῶν, -οῦσα, -οῦντες}} ({{grc-transl|-ῶν, -οῦσα, -οῦντες}}) – contracting future and contracting present
*{{lang|grc|-σᾱς, -σᾱσα, -σαντες}} ({{grc-transl|-σας, -σασα, -σαντες}}) – weak aorist
*{{lang|grc|-ών, -οῦσα, -όντες}} ({{grc-transl|-ών, -οῦσα, -όντες}}) – strong aorist
*{{lang|grc|-ώς, -υῖα, -ότες}} ({{grc-transl|-ώς, -υῖα, -ότες}}) – perfect

Middle and Passive:
*{{lang|grc|-όμενος, -ομένη, -όμενοι}} ({{grc-transl|-όμενος, -ομένη, -όμενοι}}) – present and strong aorist middle
*{{lang|grc|-σόμενος, -σομένη, -σόμενοι}} ({{grc-transl|-σόμενος, -σομένη, -σόμενοι}}) – future middle
*{{lang|grc|-σάμενος, -σαμένη, -σάμενοι}} ({{grc-transl|-σάμενος, -σαμένη, -σάμενοι}}) – weak aorist middle
*{{lang|grc|-θείς, -θεῖσα, -θέντες}} ({{grc-transl|-θείς, -θεῖσα, -θέντες}}) – weak aorist passive
*{{lang|grc|-μένος, -μένη, -μένοι}} ({{grc-transl|μένος, -μένη, -μένοι}}) – perfect middle or passive

==== An example of usage ====
Participles are very frequently used in Greek. For example, in the following sentence from Plato's ''Phaedo'' there are six participles:
: {{lang|grc|καὶ ὁ παῖς '''ἐξελθὼν''' καὶ συχνὸν χρόνον '''διατρῑ́ψᾱς''' ἧκεν '''ἄγων''' τὸν '''μέλλοντα''' δώσειν τὸ φάρμακον, ἐν κύλικι '''φέροντα''' '''τετριμμένον'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Phaedo (dialogue)|Phaedo]]'' 117a&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|καὶ ὁ παῖς '''ἐξελθὼν''' καὶ συχνὸν χρόνον '''διατρῑ́ψᾱς''' ἧκεν '''ἄγων''' τὸν '''μέλλοντα''' δώσειν τὸ φάρμακον, ἐν κύλικι '''φέροντα''' '''τετριμμένον'''.}}
: And the boy, '''after going out''' and '''after spending''' a long time, came back '''leading''' the one '''intending''' to give the poison, (who was) '''carrying''' it '''already pounded''' in a cup.

This example is analysed in the paragraphs below.

==== Different tenses of the participle ====
An aorist participle, such as {{lang|grc|ἐξελθών}} ({{grc-transl|ἐξελθών}}) "after going out", usually refers to an action which preceded the time of the main verb:
: {{lang|grc|'''ἐξελθὼν''' ἧκεν}}.
: {{grc-transl|'''ἐξελθὼν''' ἧκεν}}.
: '''After going out''' he came back.

A present participle, such as {{lang|grc|ἄγων}} ({{grc-transl|ἄγων}}) "leading", is used to refer to an action which is taking place simultaneously with the main verb:
: {{lang|grc|ἧκεν '''ἄγων''' τὸν (ἄνθρωπον)}}.
: {{grc-transl|ἧκεν '''ἄγων''' τὸν (ἄνθρωπον)}}.
: He came back '''leading''' the man.

A perfect participle, such as {{lang|grc|τετριμμένον}} ({{grc-transl|τετριμμένον}}) "pounded", generally refers to the state that something is in as a result of an earlier action, e.g. "fallen", "dead", "broken" etc., rather than to the action itself:
: {{lang|grc|τὸ φάρμακον ἐν κύλικι φέροντα '''τετριμμένον'''.}}
: {{grc-transl|τὸ φάρμακον ἐν κύλικι φέροντα '''τετριμμένον'''.}}
: Carrying the poison '''already pounded''' in a cup.

A future participle refers to an action which is to take place after the time of the main verb, and is often used to indicate purpose:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|2044, 2065}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|εἰς Ἀθήνας ἔπλευσε ταῦτα '''ἐξαγγελῶν'''}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Hellenica]]'' 1.1.9&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|εἰς Ἀθήνας ἔπλευσε ταῦτα '''ἐξαγγελῶν'''}}
: He sailed to Athens '''to report''' ({{literal translation}} going to report) these things.

==== Agreement ====
Because it is an adjective as well as a verb, a participle has to agree in case, gender, and number with the noun it refers to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|2056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in the first example above:
* {{lang|grc|'''ἐξελθών'''}} ({{grc-transl|ἐξελθών}}) "after going out", {{lang|grc|'''διατρῑ́ψᾱς'''}} ({{grc-transl|διατρῑ́ψᾱς}}) "after spending", and {{lang|grc|'''ἄγων'''}} ({{grc-transl|ἄγων}}) "leading" are all masculine singular nominative, since they refer to the boy who is the subject of the verb {{lang|grc|ἧκεν}} ({{grc-transl|ἧκεν}}) "came back";
* {{lang|grc|'''μέλλοντα'''}} ({{grc-transl|μέλλοντα}} ) "intending" and {{lang|grc|'''φέροντα'''}} ({{grc-transl|φέροντα}}) "carrying" are both masculine singular accusative, since they refer to the man who is the object of the participle {{lang|grc|ἄγων}} ({{lang|grc|ἄγων}}) "leading";
* {{lang|grc|'''τετριμμένον'''}} ({{grc-transl|τετριμμένον}}) "pounded" is neuter singular accusative, since it describes the poison {{lang|grc|φάρμακον}} ({{grc-transl|φάρμακον}}) which is the object of the participle {{lang|grc|φέροντα}} ({{grc-transl|φέροντα}}) "carrying".

==== Circumstantial participle ====
A participle frequently describes the circumstances in which another action took place. Often it is translated with "-ing", e.g. {{lang|grc|ἄγων}} ({{grc-transl|ἄγων}}) "leading" in the example above.

In some sentences it can be translated with a clause beginning "when" or "since":
: {{lang|grc|'''κατιδὼν''' τὴν μάχην ... ἐβοήθει}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Hellenica]]'' 1.1.4&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|'''κατιδὼν''' τὴν μάχην ... ἐβοήθει}}
: '''When he saw''' the battle he went to help.

Another frequent use is in a construction known as the "[[genitive absolute]]", when the participle and its subject are placed in the genitive case. This construction is used when the participle refers to someone or something who is not the subject, object, or indirect object of the main verb:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|2070}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|ἐνῑ́κησαν Λακεδαιμόνιοι '''ἡγουμένου''' Ἀγησανδρίδου}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Hellenica]]'' 1.1.2&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἐνῑ́κησαν Λακεδαιμόνιοι '''ἡγουμένου''' Ἀγησανδρίδου}}
: The Spartans won, with Agesandridas '''leading''' them.

But if the verb is an impersonal one, it is put in the accusative, e.g. {{lang|grc|ἔξον}} ({{grc-transl|ἔξον}}) "it being possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|2076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Participle with the article ====
Sometimes a participle is used with the article, in which case it can often be translated with "who":
: {{lang|grc|τὸν '''μέλλοντα''' δώσειν τὸ φάρμακον}}.
: {{grc-transl|τὸν '''μέλλοντα''' δώσειν τὸ φάρμακον}}.
: The (man who was) '''going''' to give the poison.

==== Supplementary participle ====
As well as being used in sentences such as the above, the participle can be used following verbs with meanings such as "I know", "I notice", "I happen (to be)", "I hear (that)" and so on. This use is known as the "supplementary" participle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|2088}}ff&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|ἤκουσε Κῦρον ἐν Κιλικίᾱͅ '''ὄντα'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' 1.4.5&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἤκουσε Κῦρον ἐν Κιλικίᾱͅ '''ὄντα'''.}}
: He heard that Cyrus '''was''' in Cilicia ({{literal translation}} he heard Cyrus being in Cilicia).

: {{lang|grc|ἔτυχε καὶ ὁ Ἀλκιβιάδης '''παρών'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], 5.76.3&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἔτυχε καὶ ὁ Ἀλκιβιάδης '''παρών'''}}.
: Alcibiades also happened '''to be present''' ({{literal translation}} chanced being present).

== Voices ==
The Ancient Greek grammar has three voices. The middle and the passive voice are the same except in the future and aorists.

=== Active voice ===
An active voice verb is any verb which has the endings of the -ω or -μι verbs described above. It can be intransitive, transitive or reflexive (but intransitive is most common):
: {{lang|grc|εἰς Ἀθήνᾱς '''ἔπλευσε'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Hellenica]]'' 1.1.8&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|εἰς Ἀθήνᾱς '''ἔπλευσε'''.}}
: '''He sailed''' to Athens.

: {{lang|grc|'''ἐφύλαττον''' τὰ τείχη}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Hellenica]]'' 4.4.14&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|'''ἐφύλαττον''' τὰ τείχη}}
: '''They were guarding''' the walls.

: {{lang|grc|αὐτὸς αὑτὸν '''διέφθειρεν'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Hellenica]]'' 7.4.19&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|αὐτὸς αὑτὸν '''διέφθειρεν'''}}.
: '''He killed''' himself.

=== Middle voice ===
In addition to the active endings ({{lang|grc|-ω}} ''-ō'' and {{lang|grc|-μι}} ''-mi'') described above, many verbs also have a set of endings in {{lang|grc|-ομαι}} (''-omai'') or {{lang|grc|-μαι}} (''-mai'') which can be either passive or non-passive in meaning. When the meaning of such a verb is not passive, it is known as a "middle voice" verb.

Middle voice verbs are usually intransitive, but can also be transitive. Often the middle endings make a transitive verb intransitive:
* {{lang|grc|παύομαι}} (''paúomai'') "I stop (intransitive)"
* {{lang|grc|ἵσταμαι}} (''hístamai'') "I stand (intransitive)"

Sometimes there is a reflexive meaning or an idea of doing something for one's own benefit:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1719, 1721}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|grc|λοῦμαι}} ({{grc-transl|λοῦμαι}}) "I wash myself"
* {{lang|grc|αἱρέομαι}} ({{grc-transl|αἱρέομαι}}) "I take for myself, I choose"
* {{lang|grc|μεταπέμπομαι}} ({{grc-transl|μεταπέμπομαι}}) "I send for someone"

Sometimes there can be a reciprocal meaning:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1722, 1726}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|grc|σπονδὰς ποιεῖσθαι}} ({{grc-transl|σπονδὰς ποιεῖσθαι}} ) "to make a treaty"

Quite a number of verbs which are active in the present tense become middle in the future tense, e.g.:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1728}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|grc|λήψομαι}} ({{grc-transl|λήψομαι}}) "I will take"
* {{lang|grc|ἀκούσομαι}} ({{grc-transl|ἀκούσομαι}}) "I will hear"
* {{lang|grc|ἔσομαι}} ({{grc-transl|ἔσομαι}}) "I will be".

=== Deponent verbs ===
A number of common verbs ending in {{lang|grc|-ομαι}} ({{grc-transl|-ομαι}}) or {{lang|grc|-μαι}} ({{grc-transl|-μαι}} ) have no active-voice counterpart. These are known as "deponent" verbs.

Deponent middle verbs include verbs such as the following:
* {{lang|grc|ἀφικνέομαι}} ({{grc-transl|ἀφικνέομαι}} ) "I arrive"
* {{lang|grc|ἀποκρίνομαι}} ({{grc-transl|ἀποκρίνομαι}}) "I answer"
* {{lang|grc|γίγνομαι}} ({{grc-transl|γίγνομαι}}) "I become"
* {{lang|grc|δέχομαι}} ({{grc-transl|δέχομαι}}) "I receive"
* {{lang|grc|ἔρχομαι}} ({{grc-transl|ἔρχομαι}} ) "I come"
* {{lang|grc|μάχομαι}} ({{grc-transl|μάχομαι}}) "I fight"
* {{lang|grc|πυνθάνομαι}} ({{grc-transl|πυνθάνομαι}} ) "I find out"
* {{lang|grc|ὑπισχνέομαι}} ({{grc-transl|ὑπισχνέομαι}}  "I promise"

Some middle deponent verbs have a weak aorist tense formed with {{lang|grc|-σα-}} ({{grc-transl|-σα-}}), e.g. {{lang|grc|ἐδεξάμην}} ({{grc-transl|ἐδεξάμην}}), but frequently they have a strong aorist middle such as {{lang|grc|ἀφικόμην}} ({{grc-transl|ἀφικόμην}}) "I arrived" or {{lang|grc|ἐγενόμην}} ({{grc-transl|ἐγενόμην}} ) "I became".&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|810}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang|grc|ἔρχομαι}} ({{grc-transl|ἔρχομαι}}) "I come" is irregular in that it uses a strong aorist active {{lang|grc|ἦλθον}} ({{grc-transl|ἦλθον}} ) "I came" as its aorist tense.)

All the above, since they have an aorist in the middle voice, are known as middle deponents. There are also deponent passive verbs with aorists in  {{lang|grc|-θη-}} ({{grc-transl|-θη-}}), such as the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|811, 812}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|grc|δύναμαι}} ({{grc-transl|δύναμαι}}) "I am able"
* {{lang|grc|βούλομαι}} ({{grc-transl|βούλομαι}}) "I am minded to, I want"
* {{lang|grc|οἴομαι}} ({{grc-transl|οἴομαι}} ) "I think"

Some examples of deponent verbs in use are the following:
: {{lang|grc|τὰ δῶρα '''ἐδέξατο'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Hellenica]]'' 7.1.38&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|τὰ δῶρα '''ἐδέξατο'''}}.
: '''He received''' the gifts.

: {{lang|grc|ἐγγὺς δὲ '''γενομένων''' τῶν Ἀθηναίων, '''ἐμάχοντο'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' 6.6.5&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἐγγὺς δὲ '''γενομένων''' τῶν Ἀθηναίων, '''ἐμάχοντο'''}}.
: '''When''' the Athenians '''came''' near, the two sides '''began fighting'''.

: {{lang|grc|οὐκέτι '''ἐδυνήθη''' πλείω εἰπεῖν}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Cyropaedia]]'' 5.4.31&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|οὐκέτι '''ἐδυνήθη''' πλείω εἰπεῖν}}
: '''He became unable''' to say any more.

=== Passive voice ===
Occasionally a verb ending in {{lang|grc|-ομαι}} (''-omai'') has a clear passive sense. If so, it is said to be in the passive voice:
: {{lang|grc|ἡ πόλις ὑπὸ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων '''ἤρχετο'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lysias]], 26.2&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἡ πόλις ὑπὸ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων '''ἤρχετο'''}}.
: The city '''was being ruled''' by the Spartans.

: {{lang|grc|ἐν τῷ νόμῳ '''γέγραπται'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaeus]], 6.63&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἐν τῷ νόμῳ '''γέγραπται'''}}.
: '''It is written''' in the law. ({{literal translation}} it '''has been written''')

Usually when used passively, {{lang|grc|-ομαι}} (''-omai'') verbs have an aorist tense containing {{lang|grc|-θη-}} (''-thē-'') in the ending:
: {{lang|grc|ἐκεῖνοι κατ’ ἀξίᾱν '''ἐτιμήθησαν'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschines]], 3.118&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|ἐκεῖνοι κατ’ ἀξίᾱν '''ἐτιμήθησαν'''}}.
: Those men were deservedly honoured.

Occasionally, an aorist passive can have an ending with -η- (''-ē-''). This is known as the 2nd aorist or strong aorist passive, and uses a different verb-stem from the present. In the example below, the stem is {{lang|grc|φθαρ-}} instead of the present stem {{lang|grc|φθειρ-}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1739}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{lang|grc|οἱ πολλοὶ '''ἐφθάρησαν'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], 2.99.5&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|οἱ πολλοὶ '''ἐφθάρησαν'''}}.
: The majority '''were killed'''.

Deponent middle verbs can also be made passive in some tenses. Thus αἱρέομαι (''hairéomai'') "I choose" has an aorist passive ᾑρέθην (''hēiréthēn'') "I was chosen":
: {{lang|grc|στρατηγὸς ὑπ’ αὐτῶν '''ᾑρέθη'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lysias]], 12.65&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|στρατηγὸς ὑπ’ αὐτῶν '''ᾑρέθη'''}}.
: '''He was chosen''' by them as general.

The endings with -θη- (''-thē-'') and -η- (''-ē-'') were originally intransitive actives rather than passives&lt;ref&gt;{{Smyth|1739, 1740}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes have an intransitive meaning even in Classical Greek. For example, ἐσώθην (''esṓthē'') (from {{lang|grc|σῴζω}} ''sōízō'' "I save") often means "I got back safely" rather than "I was saved":
: {{lang|grc|οὐκ '''ἐσώθη''' ἡ ναῦς εἰς τὸν Πειραιᾶ}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]], 56.41&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{grc-transl|οὐκ '''ἐσώθη''' ἡ ναῦς εἰς τὸν Πειραιᾶ}}.
: The ship '''did''' not '''get back safely''' to [[Piraeus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3498">'''Bar recursion''' is a generalized form of recursion developed by C. Spector in his 1962 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C. Spector|chapter=Provably recursive functionals of analysis: a consistency proof of analysis by an extension of principles in current intuitionistic mathematics|editor=F. D. E. Dekker|title=Recursive Function Theory: Proc. Symposia in Pure Mathematics|volume=5|pages=1–27|year=1962|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to [[bar induction]] in the same fashion that [[primitive recursion]] is related to ordinary [[Mathematical induction|induction]], or [[transfinite recursion]] is related to [[transfinite induction]].

==Technical definition==

Let '''V''', '''R''', and '''O''' be [[type theory|types]], and ''i'' be any natural number, representing a sequence of parameters taken from ''V''. Then the function sequence ''f'' of functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; from '''V'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''+''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R''' to '''O''' is defined by bar recursion from the functions ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; : '''R''' → '''O''' and ''B'' with ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; : (('''V'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''+''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R''') x ('''V'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R''')) → '''O''' if:

* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;((λα:'''V'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''+''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)''r'') = ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'')   for any ''r'' long enough that ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+''k''&lt;/sub&gt; on any extension of ''r'' equals ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Assuming ''L'' is a continuous sequence, there must be such ''r'', because a continuous function can use only finitely much data.
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'') = ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'', (λ''x'':'''V''')''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;(cat(''p'', ''x'')))   for any ''p'' in '''V'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''+''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''.

Here "cat" is the [[concatenation]] function, sending ''p'', ''x'' to the sequence which starts with ''p'', and has ''x'' as its last term.

(This definition is based on the one by Escardó and Oliva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martín Escardó|author2=Paulo Oliva|title=Selection functions, Bar recursion, and Backwards Induction|journal=Math. Struct. in Comp.Science|url=http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/papers/selection-escardo-oliva.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Provided that for every sufficiently long function (λα)''r'' of type '''V'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R''', there is some ''n'' with ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'') = ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;((λα)''r'', (λ''x'':'''V''')''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'')), the bar induction rule ensures that ''f'' is well-defined.

The idea is that one extends the sequence arbitrarily, using the recursion term ''B'' to determine the effect, until a sufficiently long node of the tree of sequences over '''V''' is reached; then the base term ''L'' determines the final value of ''f''. The well-definedness condition corresponds to the requirement that every infinite path must eventually pass through a sufficiently long node: the same requirement that is needed to invoke a bar induction.

The principles of bar induction and bar recursion are the intuitionistic equivalents of the axiom of [[dependent choice]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremy Avigad|author-link=Jeremy Avigad|author2=Solomon Feferman|author2-link=Solomon Feferman|chapter=VI: Gödel's functional ("Dialectica") interpretation|title=''Handbook of Proof Theory''|editor=S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3894">{{merge to|Bhartṛhari|date=September 2017|discuss=Talk:Bhartrhari's paradox}}
'''Bhartrhari's paradox''' is the title of a 1981 paper by Hans and [[Radhika Herzberger]]&lt;ref&gt;Herzberger, Hans and Radhika Herzberger (1981). "Bhartrhari's Paradox" Journal of Indian Philosophy 9: 1-17 (slightly revised version of "Bhartrhari's Paradox" in Studies in Indian Philosophy. A memorial volume in honour of pandit Sukhlalji Sanghvi. (L.D. Series 84.) Gen. ed. Dalsukh Malvania et al. Ahmedabad, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; which drew attention to the discussion  of [[self-referential]] [[paradox]]es in the work ''[[Vākyapadīya]]'' attributed to  [[Bhartṛhari]], an Indian grammarian of the 5th century.

In the chapter dealing with logical and linguistic relations, the ''Sambandha-samuddeśa'', Bhartrhari discusses several statements of a paradoxical nature, including ''sarvam mithyā bravīmi'' "everything I am saying is false" which belongs to the [[liar paradox]] family, as well as the paradox arising from the statement that something is [[Proper name (philosophy)|unnameable]] or [[Sign (semiotics)|unsignifiable]] (in Sanskrit: ''avācya''): this becomes nameable or signifiable precisely by calling it unnameable or unsignifiable.

Bhartrhari's interest lies not in strengthening this and other paradoxes by abstracting them from pragmatic context, but rather in exploring how a stubborn paradox may arise from unproblematic situations in daily communication.
&lt;!--Bhartrhari thus tries to meet the challenge{{seriously??}} formulated by [[Jon Barwise|Barwise]] and [[John Etchemendy|Etchemendy]] as follows:
: "An adequate analysis of a paradox must diagnose the source of the problem the paradox reveals, and thereby help us refine the concepts involved, making them truly coherent. But it should do so in such a way that in normal situations business can proceed as usual. This is what has happened, for example, in set theory and relativity theory. But it has not yet happened in the case of the semantical paradoxes, or so we will claim."&lt;ref&gt;Barwise, Jon, and John Etchemendy. 1989. The Liar : An Essay on Truth and Circularity. First edition 1987, First issue as an Oxford University Press paperback (with Postscript, 187-194). New York: Oxford University Press, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

An unproblematic situation of communication is turned into a paradox — we have either [[contradiction]] (''virodha'') or [[infinite regress]] (''anavasthā'') — when abstraction is made from the signification and its extension in time, by accepting a simultaneous, opposite function (''apara vyāpāra'') undoing the previous one.&lt;ref&gt;Jan E.M. Houben,  "Paradoxe et perspectivisme dans la philosophie de langage de Bhartrhari: langage, pensée et réalité", ''Bulletin d'Études Indiennes'' 19 (2001):173-199. www.academia.edu/6169499/&lt;/ref&gt;

For Bhartrhari it is important to analyse and solve the unsignifiability paradox because he holds that what cannot be signified may nevertheless be indicated (''vyapadiśyate'') and it may be understood (''pratīyate'') to exist.

'''Carles Fages de Climent''' (1902 in [[Figueres]] &amp;ndash; 1968) was a writer, poet and journalist from the [[Empordà]], a historical region of Catalonia, Spain. He was born in Figueres on May 16, 1902. In Figueres' high school, he met [[Salvador Dalí]], starting a friendship that would last all their lives.

Fages de Climent contributed to the literary mythification of his native region, taking the [[Empordà]], the northern wind, the [[tramuntana]] and its people as a thematic basis of a multiple literary production (poetry, prose, theater and journalism). Thus, he created literary characters like [[the Cobbler of Ordis]] – comparable, according to [[Eugeni d'Ors]] to [[Don Quixote]] of Cervantes. He also contributed in a decisive way to conferring determinate attributions to certain villages of the Empordà like ([[Llers]], land of witches; or [[Vila-sacra]], capital of the world).

== Fages and Dalí ==
He collaborated several times with his friend and schoolmate Salvador Dalí, who, in 1924, being still almost unknown painter, illustrated a book for the first time. It was Fages' poem, in Catalan language ''Les bruixes de Llers (The Witches of Llers)''. He illustrated as well another book of Fages de Climent, ''La balada del Sabater d'Ordis (The Balad of the Cobbler of Ordis)'' (1954), writing also the epilogue. They finally worked together at the occasion of the homage that the city of [[Figueres]] paid, in 1961, to Salvador Dalí. They made an [[Auca (cartoon)|auca]] – a series of pictures with captions in rhyming couplets which tell a story – entitled in Catalan language ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20140702121420/http://shlo18.wix.com/salvador El triomf i el rodolí de la Gala i en Dalí]'' (''The triumph and the couplet of Gala and Dalí''). Fages put the verses and Dalí the drawings. The text is a poetic biography of the painter and the ilustracions provide a brilliant synthesis of all the Dalinian symbology. Thus, the [[Soft Watches|soft watches]], the ants, the [[Jean-François Millet#The Angelus|Angelus]] of [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]], the shoemaker of [[Ordis]], and some of the main Dalinian referents, like [[Picasso]] or [[Gaudí]].

It is also worth mentioning Dalí's paintwork "Christ of the Tramontana", held in the [[Dalí Theatre and Museum]] – carried out by Salvador Dalí in homage to Fages de Climent on the occasion of his death, and that makes allusion to one of the most popular verses of Fages de Climent, "The Prayer to the Christ of the Tramuntana".

'''Cocoliche''' &lt;ref&gt;[https://spanishspeakingworld-12c.wikispaces.com/Cocoliche+-+A+Look+into+the+Past+and+Future "Cocoliche", by Antonio Garbarino]&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Italian language|Italian]]–[[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[macaronic language|mixed language or pidgin]] that was spoken by [[Italian settlement in Argentina|Italian immigrants]] in [[Argentina]] (especially in [[Gran Buenos Aires|Greater Buenos Aires]]) and [[Uruguay]] between 1870 and 1970. In the last decades of the 20th century, it has transferred / evolved in the [[Lunfardo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dspace.unive.it/bitstream/handle/10579/8818/964634-1209186.pdf?sequence=2 Universidad Ca'Foscari: Cocoliche and Lunfardo (in Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Between 1880 and 1910, Argentina and [[Uruguay]] received a large number of Italian immigrants, mostly poor country folk who arrived with little or no schooling in the [[Spanish language]] and often were only semi-literate or totally illiterate in their [[Italian languages]].

As those immigrants strove to communicate with the local ''[[Spanish Criollo peoples|criollos]]'', they produced a variable mixture of Spanish with Italian and Italian dialects, which was given the derogatory name ''Cocoliche'' by the locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cocoliche and the origins of a regional dialect | url=http://www.transpanish.biz/translation_blog/cocoliche-and-the-origins-of-a-regional-dialect | publisher=Transpanish | date=30 Jan 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|{{citation needed span|''Another example of a language influence is Cocoliche, which takes its name from Antonio Cuculicchio, a theater worker in the Podestá theater company established in Argentina and Uruguay towards the end of the nineteenth century. An Italian immigrant, Cuculicchio’s accent was apparently often mocked by others, giving rise to the comical caricature of a figure called “Cocolicchio”, representing a southern Italian. Cocoliche is a hybrid language that arose from the meeting of Spanish in Argentina and Italian brought to that country by immigrants around the turn of the twentieth century. The result was a ''pidgin'' — an oral form of communication that blended elements of two languages to foster communication between diverse groups of people, in some cases simplifying the grammar and lexicon of each language.''|date=October 2015}} | Translation Blog | Transpanish}}

Italian proper never took hold very well in Argentina, especially because most immigrants used their local [[dialect]]s, and were not proficient in the standard language. This prevented the development of an Italian-language culture. Since the children of the immigrants grew up speaking Spanish at school, work, and military service, Cocoliche remained confined mostly to the first and second generation of Italian immigrants, and slowly fell out of use.  The pidgin was depicted humorously in literary works and in the Argentine [[sainete]] theater, e.g. by [[Dario Vittori]].

The area where most Italian emigrants and their descendants spoke the Cocoliche was near the port of [[Buenos Aires]], mainly in the ''barrios'' [[Belgrano, Buenos Aires|Belgrano]] and [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]]. These two areas where 70% speaking "Cocoliche" at the beginning of the 20th century.

==Influence==
Many Cocoliche words were transferred to the [[Lunfardo]] (a local Spanish dialect that some linguists{{who|date=October 2015}} think it is a mixture of Spanish, [[Lombard language|Lombard]], and [[Italian language|Italian]]). For example:

* ''manyar'' (to eat) from [[Venetian language|Venetian]] and [[Lombard language|Lombard]] "magnar" (''mangiare'' in Italian) 
* ''lonyipietro'' (fool)
* ''fungi'' (mushroom) -&gt; in Lunfardo: hat
* ''vento'' (wind) -&gt; in Lunfardo: money
* ''matina'' (morning) from Italian "mattina"
* ''mina'' (girl) from [[Lombard language|Lombard]] "mina" (''busty woman'' or ''prostitute'') 
* ''laburar'' (to work) from Italian "lavorare"
* ''minga'' (nothing) from [[Lombard language|Lombard]] "minga" (negative particle like ''not'' in English or ''ne pas'' in French)
* ''yeta'' (bad luck) from [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] "[[wikt:iettatore|iettatore]]"
* ''yira'' (to go for a walk) from Italian "girare"
* ''salute'' (cheers) from Italian "salute"
* ''fiaca'' (laziness) from Italian "fiacca"

Some of these words show a characteristic codialect evolution, for example in the case of ''manyar'', the word ''manyar'' does exist with the same meaning in Spanish even though it is considered jargon and not proper Spanish, being derived from [[Occitan]] ''manjer'' and reinforced by the Italian ''mangiare''.

'''Dactylomancy''', from the Greek word for finger, is a term used by proponents to define a form of [[divination]] using [[ring (jewellery)|rings]].&lt;ref name=scilitmedag1&gt;Jacob, P. L. (1878) "Science and Literature in the Middle Ages, and at the Period of the Renaissance", Bickers and Son&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern dactylomancy ==

In some traditions of dactylomancy, a ring is suspended like a pendulum above a surface that is marked with letters or symbols. The direction of the swing indicates which symbols are to be consulted, or which letter are to be formed into a message, in answer to a specific question.&lt;ref name=ocency1&gt;Spence, Lewis (2003), "Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology", Kessinger Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7661-2815-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=divforbgn1&gt;Cunningham, Scott (2003), "Divination for Beginners: Reading the Past, Present &amp; Future", Llewellyn Worldwide, {{ISBN|0-7387-0384-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another tradition follows the same pattern as [[Séance]] table-rapping. In it a ring is suspended from a tumbler so that it may touch the sides if swung and a code is agreed upon (e.g., 1 for yes, 2 for no). A question is then posed and the number of the times that the ring strikes the side of the tumbler is interpreted as being an answer.&lt;ref name=ocency1/&gt;&lt;ref name=divforbgn1/&gt;

== Historic dactylomancy ==

A more complex form of dactylomancy was practiced in Europe during the Middle Ages in which a ring was suspended above a circular table marked with the symbols of the zodiac. 78 metal discs inscribed with a letter of the alphabet (three discs per letter) were then placed on the table and the thread holding the ring was burnt. The letters that the ring rolled across and the one on which it halted were then consulted to form the answer to the question being divined.&lt;ref name=divforbgn1/&gt; In this tradition, the metal from which the ring was made was determined by the day of the week.&lt;ref name=divforbgn1/&gt;

* Monday - Silver, to represent the moon
* Tuesday - Iron, to represent Mars
* Wednesday - Tin/lead, to represent Mercury
* Thursday - Tin, to represent Jupiter
* Friday - Copper, to represent Venus
* Saturday - Lead, to represent Saturn
* Sunday - Gold, to represent the sun &lt;ref name=divforbgn1/&gt;

According to Diderot, the person who held the ring was typically dressed from head to toe in only a sheet of cloth; his head was shaved in a circular manner, and he held verbena in his hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|title=l'Encyclopedie: Dactyliomancy|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0002.604|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern dactylomancy is usually associated with [[spiritualism]] and [[new age]] beliefs, rather [[Parapsychology]].

'''''Echographies of Television: Filmed Interviews''''' ({{lang-fr|Échographies de la télévision. Entretiens filmés}}) is a book by [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Bernard Stiegler]]. It was originally published in [[France]] in 1996, by Éditions Galilée. The [[English language|English]] translation by Jennifer Bajorek was published by Polity Press in 2002.

''Echographies of Television'' discusses a number of subjects, but the overall theme concerns the impact of [[accelerating change|technological acceleration]], and in particular the social, political and philosophical significance of the development of [[digital media]].

== Contents ==
The book consists of three parts.
*'''Artifactualities'''. This section is by Derrida, and consists of excerpts from an interview with Derrida published in the French journal ''Passages'' in 1993.
*'''Echographies of Television'''. This section forms the bulk of the volume and consists of Stiegler conducting an extended interview with Derrida. The interview was filmed by [[Jean-Christophe Rosé]] under the auspices of the [[Institut National de l'Audiovisuel]], on December 22, 1993. The interview was originally intended for broadcast on television, but this never took place.
*'''The Discrete Image'''. The third section consists of an article by Stiegler, which was first published in ''Art/Photographie numérique. L'image réinventée'' (Aix-en-Provence: Cyprès, 1995).

== Artifactualities ==
In "Artifactualities," Derrida begins by stating that "to think one's time" means, more than ever, thinking how this "time" is artificially produced, an artifact. He argues that "actuality" is always a matter of "artifactuality," involving selection, editing, [[performativity]], and thus amounting to a "fictional fashioning".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|2002|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida therefore argues that we must develop a "critical culture" concerning this production of actuality, but he immediately appends three cautions to this statement:
*the need to recall that despite the "internationalisation" of communication, [[ethnocentrism]] still predominates in the form of the "national"
*advances in the domain of "live" broadcast and recording give the illusion of an actuality which is not produced
*the artifactuality of actuality must not be used as an alibi, by concluding that therefore nothing ever happens and there is nothing but simulacrum and delusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|2002|pp=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
What is least acceptable in the media today, he argues, is to take one's time, or to waste time, and hence what is perhaps most required is to effect a change in the ''rhythm'' of the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|2002|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrida then asks what it means to be concerned with the present, or to do so as a philosopher. It may be a matter, he notes, of in fact being ''un''timely, of ''not'' confusing the present with actuality. One must, on the one hand, take one's time, hold back, defer, while, on the other hand, one must rush into things headlong, urgently—one must be both hyperactual and anachronistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|2002|pp=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida has never thought there to be an opposition between urgency and ''[[différance]]''. If ''différance'' involves a relation to alterity which is a form of deferral, it is nevertheless also, and for this reason, a relation to "what comes," to the unexpected, to the event as such, and therefore to the urgent. We cannot oppose the event, which is the very possibility of a future—we only oppose those particular events which bring things which are not good. The performativity of the event exceeds all anticipation or programming, and hence contains an irreducible element of messianism, linking it to justice (here distinguished from law), as well as to revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|2002|pp=10–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the most general logics and the most unpredictable singularities comes "rhythm". If, for example, we could know in advance that the [[Communism|Communist]] regimes of [[Eastern Europe]] were doomed to failure, the pace and rhythm at which this occurred could only be understood retrospectively, taking into account causalities which had been previously overlooked, such as the way in which the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] was immediately inscribed in a global telecommunications network.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|2002|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politics must retain a sense of the unanticipated, of the arrival of the absolutely unexpected, the absolute ''arrivant''. A politics which loses all reference to a principle of unconditional hospitality is a politics, Derrida argues, that loses its reference to justice. This may mean, for example, that it is necessary to distinguish a politics of immigration from a politics of the right to asylum, because the former presumes the equivalence of the political and the national (immigration policy is a matter for the nation-state), while the latter does not (since, for example, motives for immigration, such as unemployment, may fail to conform to immigration requirements, but nevertheless are a kind of dysfunction of the nation, if not indeed the indirect result on poor countries of decisions made by wealthy countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|2002|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, Derrida provides a critique of the way in which borders are conceived by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] and the French [[National Front (France)|National Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|2002|pp=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It remains necessary, Derrida argues, to take up the battle fought by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment philosophy]] against the "return of the worst". As a struggle against return, it is a matter of a "law of the spectral," of spectres, ghosts, and phantoms. It is a matter of understanding that what comes back is on the one hand what must be fought against, and on the other hand irreducible, originary, and necessary. Thus when we are striving to remember the worst (for example, the complicity of the [[Vichy France|French state]] for the treatment of Jews during [[World War II]]), we are striving to recall the victims, but this means also to call them ''back'', not just for the sake of a present, but for an ''ongoing'' struggle, and thus for a future.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|2002|pp=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All this is a question of spirit and of inheritance. There is more than one spirit, and thus when we speak of spirit, we ''choose'' one spirit over another, affirm one injunction or interpretation over another, and thus take up a responsibility. To inherit is to reaffirm an injunction, but to take it up as an assignation to be deciphered. In so doing, we are what we inherit. We must decide, and we can only decide, on the basis of what we inherit, but these decisions are also the transformation of what we inherit, and therefore always also involve invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|2002|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrida concludes by stating that he does not believe in the return of Communism in the form of the party, yet he does believe in the return of critiques which are [[Marxism|Marxist]] in inspiration and spirit. This new [[Political international|International]] without party, which does not accept the imposition of a [[New world order (politics)|new world order]], must be more, Derrida argues, than a matter of being able to take the time to read [[Karl Marx|Marx]] slowly and carefully, now that "Marx is dead". In this sense, it is a question of more than simply the elaboration of critiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|2002|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right of Inspection ===
In "Echographies of Television," Stiegler begins by noting that Derrida, in agreeing to record their interview, asked for a "right of inspection". He asks Derrida why he did so, and what this would mean in the era of television and "teletechnologies".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|Stiegler|2002|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida responds that if he did so, he did not imagine such a right would be effective, and that it is difficult for intellectuals to adapt to the conditions of television, even if they must also not cut themselves off from a public sphere dominated by that medium. It may be a matter not of fighting today against teletechnologies but rather so that they are able to make more room for different norms, those of intellectuals, artists, scientists, etc. Today the "right to inspection" belongs, more than to anyone else, to those who show, edit, store, interpret and exploit images.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|Stiegler|2002|pp=31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stiegler points out that we learn from reading Derrida himself that writing is already a kind of teletechnology, and he therefore asks Derrida about the specificity of these more contemporary teletechnologies, especially television.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|Stiegler|2002|pp=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than immediately answering the question directly, Derrida first states that the answer ''cannot'' be a matter of opposing contemporary prostheses to some prior epoch of immediate or natural speech. If there ''is'' a specificity of modern teletechnology, then it has something to do with the directness of "live" recording and transmission, and the speed with which what is recorded can be made to travel the farthest distances. Nevertheless, however, we must also recognise that even the most "live" broadcasts are ''produced''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|Stiegler|2002|pp=37–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artifactuality, Homohegemony ===
Stiegler asks Derrida about his term, "artifactuality," which indicates that the construction of "actuality" passes through the artifact or the artificial, that it involves a selection. Stiegler suggests that what is important about this is not so much that reality is "artificially" constructed on the basis of a selection, but rather what matters are the ''criteria'' of selection. He therefore asks Derrida if the problem today is that the selection criteria are overdetermined by the "commercial character of industry," and thus if when Derrida speaks of a "[[politics of memory]]," he is talking about regulating the effects of market pressure on the construction of actuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|Stiegler|2002|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida responds by indicating that the concept of the market is complicated: the market cannot be opposed to state practice, insofar as, for example, public television channels, as soon as they are in competition with private channels, must themselves "conquer the market," becoming concerned with ratings, etc. To address Stiegler's question would mean, Derrida says, knowing what one means by the market in a world in which there is an increasingly "globalised" circulation of televisual commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|Stiegler|2002|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Discrete Image ==
"The Discrete Image" is an essay by Stiegler about the significance of the invention of digital photography and digital cinema. He begins by stating that "the image in general" does not exist. The mental image (the image I see in my mind) cannot be separated from the image-object (a painting, photograph, etc.), and the latter is always inscribed in a technical history. Just as Derrida showed that there is no transcendental [[Sign (semiotics)|signified]] (no meaning) which can be shown to precede its inscription in a signifier, so too there is no "transcendental imagery" which precedes the image-object. If the mental image and the image-object cannot be opposed, however, they are nevertheless different, first of all because the image-object lasts while the mental image is ephemeral. But if there has never been an image-object without a mental image, even so, there has never been a mental image which is not, in some way, the ''return'' of an image-object.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stiegler|2002|pp=147–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stiegler identifies three stages in the recent history of the image object:
*in the 19th century, the invention of the ''analog image'', that is, photography
*in the 20th century, the ''digital image'', that is, computer-generated imagery
*at the end of the 20th century, the ''analogico-digital image'', that is, digital photography.
This third stage is part of a "systematic discretization of movement," a process of "grammatisation of the visible".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|Stiegler|2002|pp=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Most translations of Stiegler prefer "grammatisation" rather than translator Jennifer Bajorek's choice, "grammaticalisation". Stiegler describes grammatisation as follows: "What I call grammatisation is the process by which all the fluxes through which symbolic (that is, also, existential) acts are linked, can be discretised, formalised, and reproduced." Stiegler, ''Mécréance et discrédit 1. La décadence des démocraties industrielles'' (Paris: Galilée, 2004), pp. 65–6, n. 1. For evidence indicating why "grammatisation" is a preferable translation, see Stiegler, ''De la misère symbolique 1. L'époque hyperindustrielle'' (Paris: Galilée, 2004), p. 113.|group=Note}}

Great moments of technical innovation "suspend" a situation which previously appeared stable, and impose a new situation. Analogico-digital technology is one such moment, in which what is undergoing an intense evolution are the conditions by which we perceive and, therefore, the conditions by which we believe. This is because the digital photograph suspends a certain spontaneous belief which the analog photograph bore within itself: it calls into question what [[Roland Barthes]] called the "this was" of the photograph, its [[intentionality]] (in a [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] sense). Although it is possible to manipulate the analog photo, this is as it were an "accidental" possibility, whereas manipulation is the ''essence'' of the digital photo.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|Stiegler|2002|pp=149–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the "accidental" possibility of manipulating the ''analog'' image is something which had already been increasingly undertaken by the mass media in recent years. The ability to do so derives from the fact that even the analog photo is a technical synthesis, and as such exposed to an irreducible potential for falsification. For this falsification to be effective, there must be an alteration of what was, but there must also be a ''belief'' on the part of the viewer in the "this was" of the photo. Today, however, with the analogico-digital photo, the conditions of this belief are diminished, leading to a general ''doubt'', and one which affects, for example, democracy. This doubt must be doubled by another doubt, a positive, resolute doubt leading to new forms of "objective analysis" and "subjective synthesis," and therefore to a new kind of belief and of disbelief. The doubt and fear caused by the analogico-digital image is therefore ''also'' what would make possible this more ''knowing'' belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|Stiegler|2002|pp=150–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The destabilisation of knowledge caused by digitalisation may induce fear, but analog photography also caused people to be afraid: "in the first photographs, we saw phantoms". Analog photography is the result of a "contiguity of luminances," that is, light reflecting from an object strikes photosensitive film, which is then developed with the use of light, producing a photograph which I see when light reflects from the photograph onto my retina. There is a definite chain of light events, connecting the moment the camera records an image and the moment the developed photograph is seen. This is, in a way, a matter of the past touching me in the present, of something coming to touch me from out of the night of the past. With the digital photo, this chain is broken, or decomposed: there is a ''treatment'' involved in the production of the digital image, reducing the image to binary code to be manipulated and adjusted, which does not require this contiguity of luminances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|Stiegler|2002|pp=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digitalisation is a form of "discretisation": whereas the analog photo relies on the ''continuity'' of the chain of luminances, and the continuity of the way in which the spectrum is recorded, these two aspects become, in the digital photo, ''discontinuous''. Reducing the image to binary code means breaking the spectrum down into discontinuous elements which can be treated in any way whatsoever. Yet the analogico-digital photo does retain ''something'' of the chain of light events which characterised the analog photo: insofar as it remains a ''photo''. At the same time, however, there is no way for the viewer to ''know'' what aspects of the photo are actual records of a photographic event, and which parts have been altered, added, or subtracted, in a way completely disconnected from the photographic process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|Stiegler|2002|pp=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extending the analysis conducted by [[Walter Benjamin]], Stiegler delineates three kinds of reproducibility which constitute three great epochs of memory:
*the reproducibility of the letter (first handwritten, then printed)
*the analog photographic and cinematographic reproducibility studied by Benjamin
*digital reproducibility.
The difference between the analog and the digital has traditionally been understood in terms of an opposition between the continuous and the discontinuous. The fact that the image has been understood as continuous in this sense is why it has been thought to resist semiological interpretation, which depends on the discreteness of the sign. But with the advent of the analogico-digital image, combining two kinds of reproducibility, it becomes clear that the image was always in a way discrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|Stiegler|2002|pp=155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production and realisation of images by an artist or filmmaker is a form of analysis, which treats images as discrete elements to be edited and assembled. The work of the spectator who puts this together in imagination as a "continuous" whole is a form of synthesis. That we experience the progression of images in film as a continuous movement is less the result of [[persistence of vision|retinal persistence]] than it is of the spectator's ''expectations'', which work to efface the editing. These expectations are always a question of the return of phantoms from the past: animation is always reanimation. Thus if the image is always discrete, it is so, as it were, discreetly, without drawing attention. But with digital technology it becomes possible not only to produce cinematic or televisual works in a new way, but to analyse and therefore interpret these in a new way—for example, to index images, camera movements, voices, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|Stiegler|2002|pp=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, digitisation "opens the possibility of new knowledges of the image". Discretising the continuous makes it possible to decompose the ''this was'', and thus the spectator may come to have not only a synthetic but an analytic relation to the image. That this is possible is because the synthesis we make in our minds when we view an image happens according to conditions related to the technical synthesis effected by the recording apparatus. To view an image is to engage with that technical synthesis, and implies a kind of knowledge of the apparatus by the spectator that determines the conditions of the experience of spectatorship. So a change in the technical conditions of reproducibility will mean a mutation in the way in which a spectator synthesises an image. To each of the epochs of reproducibility corresponds three different kinds of ''belief''. The fact that digitalisation makes very possible the representation of things which were never in front of a lens changes the conditions of belief, specifically the belief that photography is a matter of the return of the past in the present. As such, analogico-digital photography possesses a different spirit than previous photographic technology, because what the spectator ''knows'' about the image is that it has an uncertain relation to "reality": there is an irreducible non-knowledge inscribed in the spectator's knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|Stiegler|2002|pp=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes to the ''analytic'' capacities of the spectator inevitably produce changes in the way the spectator [[intentionality|"intentionalises"]] imagery, that is, changes in spectatorial ''synthesis''. This is similar to the way in which the alphabetisation of writing produced changes in the synthesis of language. It is the history and evolution of ''writing'' that made possible the critical and logical spirit which we attribute to language, and which we have until now ''not'' attributed to the apprehension of the image. Grammar claims to locate the [[rules of language]], but as every language is always undergoing a process of becoming, and is never anything other than the sum of the "use" of that language by speakers, these grammatical rules can never be a matter of a "competence" which precedes those rules brought forth and invented in the course of linguistic ''performance''. What this means for the analogico-digital image is that, as increasing analytical possibilities emerge from the technologies of the image, the descriptions and rules which emerge from these possibilities will at the same time mean the ''transformation'' of what is being described. The question is to know how to take advantage of these opportunities for transformation which will emerge from technological advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|Stiegler|2002|pp=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, "the ''evolution of the technical synthesis'' implies the ''evolution of the spectatorial synthesis''". As Derrida showed in relation to the sign, language is always already writing, a system of traces, composed of discrete elements. Stiegler proposes a similar hypothesis in relation to the image: "life (''anima'' – on the side of the mental image) is always ''already'' cinema (animation – image-object)". Thus the evolution of ''both'' forms of synthesis, technical and spectatorial, occurs as one ''composed'' process, in what ''Gilbert Simondon'' calls a "transductive relation". The massive changes which will follow from digitisation are a chance to develop a "culture of reception". This is in contrast to the way in which Hollywood has taken up these changes: by ''opposing'' production and consumption, keeping analysis in the hands of the producers, and synthesis a matter for consumers. Changing this relation means creating a situation more like that of literature: one cannot read a work of literature without, in a sense, knowing how to write. A world in which the spectator will see the image analytically will also be a world in which "television" and "text" are no longer opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Derrida|Stiegler|2002|pp=161–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glossophobia''' or '''speech anxiety''' is the fear of [[public speaking]].&lt;ref name="About.com"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Fritscher | first = Lisa | title = Glossophobia | publisher = About.com | url = http://phobias.about.com/od/phobiaslist/a/glossophobia.htm | accessdate = 13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''glossophobia'' derives from the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] γλῶσσα ''glōssa'', meaning tongue, and φόβος ''phobos'', fear or dread. Some people have this specific phobia, while others may also have broader social phobia or [[social anxiety disorder]].

[[Stage fright]] may be a symptom of glossophobia.&lt;ref name="About.com"/&gt;

== Symptoms ==
{{original research|section|date=March 2011}}
Symptoms include:
*intense [[anxiety]] prior to, or simply at the thought of having to verbally communicate with any group, 
*avoidance of events which focus the group's attention on individuals in attendance,
*physical distress, [[nausea]], or feelings of [[panic]] in such circumstances.
The more specific symptoms of speech anxiety can be grouped into three categories: physical, verbal, and non-verbal. Physical symptoms result from the sympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) responding to the situation with a "[[Fight-or-flight response|fight-or-flight]]" reaction. 

During the phobic response, adrenaline secretion produces a wide array of symptoms which enhances the "fight or flight" response. As Garcia-Lopez (2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Garcia-Lopez, L.J.|year=2013|url=https://www.academia.edu/2632777/Social_phobia._Social_anxiety_Book._Treating...social_anxiety_disorder._Treatment|title=Treating...social anxiety disorder|location=Madrid|publisher=Piramide}}&lt;/ref&gt; has noted, symptoms can include acute hearing, increased heart rate and blood pressure, dilated pupils, increased perspiration and oxygen intake, stiffening of neck/upper back muscles, and dry mouth. Uncontrollable shaking is also common and often occurs prior to the phobia-eliciting stimulus. Symptoms may sometimes be alleviated or mitigated by medications such as [[beta-blockers]].

Verbal symptoms of the fight or flight response include (but are not limited to) a tense or quivering voice, and vocalized pauses (which tend to comfort anxious speakers). One form of speech anxiety is dysfunctional speech anxiety in which the intensity of the fight-or-flight response prevents an individual from performing effectively.

==Research==
Many people report stress-fueled [[speech disorder]]s which are only present during public speech. Some individuals with glossophobia have been able to dance, perform in public, or even to speak (such as in a play), or sing if they cannot see the audience, or if they feel that they are presenting a character or stage persona other than themselves. Being able to blend in a group (as in a choir or band) has been reported to also alleviate some anxiety caused by glossophobia.

It has been estimated that 75% of all people experience some degree of anxiety/nervousness when it comes to public speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hamilton, C. |year=2008|orig-year=2005|title=Communicating for Results, a Guide for Business and the Professions (eighth edition)|location=Belmont, CA|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth}}&lt;/ref&gt; If untreated, public speaking anxiety can lead to serious detrimental effects on one's quality of life, career goals and other areas. For example, educational goals requiring public speaking might be left unaccomplished. However, not all persons with public speaking anxiety are necessarily unable to achieve work goals, though this disorder becomes problematic when it prevents an individual from attaining or pursuing a goal they might otherwise have – were it not for their anxiety.

A recent study conducted by Garcia-Lopez, Diez-Bedmar, and Almansa-Moreno (2013) has reported that previously trained students could act as trainers to other students and help them to improve their public speaking skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Garcia-Lopez, L. J.|author2=Diez-Bedmar, M.B.|author3=Almansa-Moreno, J.M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2013|url=https://www.academia.edu/5431076/Public_speaking_treatment._Trainer._trainee|title=From being a trainee to being a trainer: helping peers improve their public speaking skills|journal=Journal of Psychodidactics|volume=18|issue=2|pp=331–342|doi=10.1387/RevPsicodidact.6419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Help and relief ==
Training courses in public speaking and/or organizations such as [[Australian Rostrum]], [[Toastmasters International]], POWERtalk International, and [[Association of Speakers Clubs]] can help people to reduce their fear of public speaking to manageable levels. [[Self-help]] materials that address public speaking are among the best selling self-help topics.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} To temporarily treat their phobia, some affected people have turned to certain types of medications, typically [[beta blocker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehealthyapron.com/glossophobia-fear-public-speaking|title=Glossophobia – Everything You Need to Know|last=Fadden|first=Helen|date=November 2016|website=thehealthyapron.com/|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, anxiety can be mitigated by a speaker not attempting to resist their anxiety, thus fortifying the anxiety/fight-or-flight loop. Other strategies involve using one's nervousness to enliven an otherwise fearful speech presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mastering Public Speaking 9th Edition|last = Grice|first = George L.|publisher = Pearson|year = 2015|isbn = 0133753832|location = |pages = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A speaker's anxiety can also be reduced if they know their topic well and [[belief|believe]] in it. It has been suggested that people should practice speaking in front of smaller, less intimidating groups when they're getting started in public speaking. Additionally, focusing on friendly, attentive people in the audience has been found to help. 

Traditional advice has been to urge fearful speakers not to take themselves too seriously, and to be reminded that mistakes are often unnoticed by audiences. Gaining experience in public speaking often results in it becoming less anxiety-provoking over time. Recent studies suggest that there is a close link between fear of public speaking and self-efficacy and that attempts to help presenters improve their [[self-efficacy]] will also reduce this fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/ARA-03-2013-0017|title=Communication apprehension and communication self‐efficacy in accounting students|first1=Trevor |last1=Hassall|first2=Jose L.|last2= Arquero|first3=John |last3=Joyce|first4=Jose M.|last4= Gonzalez|date=12 July 2013|publisher=|journal=Asian Review of Accounting|volume=21|issue=2|pages=160–175|via=emeraldinsight.com (Atypon)|doi=10.1108/ARA-03-2013-0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://pdf.steerweb.org/Handbook%20of%20Curriculum%20Development%20-%20L.%20Kattington%20(Nova,%202010)%20WW.pdf#page=202 | title=Handbook of Curriculum Development | publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]] | year=2010 | location=New York | pages=202 | isbn=978-1-61122-882-3 | editor=Limon E.

Loosening up a "tough crowd" by asking questions promotes audience participation. A speaker may also find this exercise to be helpful when their mind "goes blank", as it gives them time to regain their train of thought.

==Causes==
The causes of glossophobia may vary. Often, it can be linked to traumatic experiences, or fearful events occurring during childhood, adolescence and early adulthood in which the speaker endured a traumatic childhood experience related to the public speaking. Genetics may also play a role, as might evolutionary factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Phobias/Pages/causes.aspx|title=Phobias - Causes - NHS Choices|first=NHS|last=Choices|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, other key causes of this anxiety have been identified as the novelty of the experience, the characteristics of the audience, the [[illusion of transparency]] and the degree to which the speaker identifies public speaking as a performance as opposed to an act of [[communication]].&lt;ref name=Ireland/&gt;

An uncommon cause for glossophobia may come from a medical condition or a health concern. A serious brain injury can lead to different phobias, including glossophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/health/phobia-simple-specific#Causes2|title=Phobias|publisher=Healthline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Civic Cocktail (16988349966).jpg|thumb|Members of the Seattle City Council interviewed on "Civic Cocktail" on the government-access television [[Seattle Channel]], March 30, 2015.]]
'''Government-access television''' ('''GATV''') is a type of [[specialty channel|specialty]] [[television channel]] created by [[government]] entities (generally [[local governments]]) and [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] over [[cable TV]] systems or, in some cases, [[terrestial television|over-the-air]] broadcast [[television station]]s. GATV programming generally deals with [[Public affairs programming|public affairs]], board meetings (i.e. [[city council]], [[county commission]], and [[school board]]), explanation of government services, and other public-service related programming such as [[public service announcement]]s and longer [[public information film]]s.

In the United States, laws regarding GATV are contained in the [[US Code]], title 47, section 531 ({{usc|47|531}}), and are [[Law enforcement|enforced]] by the [[Federal Communications Commission]]. Since cable systems are privately owned entities (unlike broadcast television), the [[must-carry]] requirement for GATV channels is often drawn out in local [[franchising]] agreements for the [[municipality]] or [[County (United States)|county]] it operates in.

GATV is often associated with [[public-access television]], such as with the term [[PEG channel]]s.

'''Hunzib''' is a [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian language]] spoken by about 1840 people in southern [[Dagestan]],&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=huz Ethnologue entry for Hunzib]&lt;/ref&gt; near the [[Russia]]n border with [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

==Classification==
Hunzib belongs to the [[Tsezic languages|Tsezic group]] of the [[Northeast Caucasian languages]]. It is most closely related to [[Bezhta language|Bezhta]] and [[Khwarshi language|Khwarshi]], according to the latest research.&lt;ref name="Schulze09"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170918202042/http://wolfgangschulze.in-devir.com/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=63 The Languages of the Caucasus, by Wolfgang Schulze (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; Other Tsezic languages include [[Tsez language|Tsez]] and [[Hinukh language|Hinukh]]. Khwarshi was previously grouped together with Tsez and Hinukh instead of with Hunzib.

==Geographic distribution==
Hunzib is not an official language, nor is it written. It is spoken in the [[Tsuntinsky District|Tsunta]] and [[Kizilyurtovsky District|Kizilyurt]] districts of [[Dagestan]] and in two villages across the Russian border in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ethnologue.com/language/huz&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
{{expand section|date=January 2010}}

===Gender===
Like a number of other Northeast Caucasian languages, Hunzib has a [[grammatical gender]] system with five classes. The first classes, I and II mark male and female rationals, respectively, while the remaining classes mark non-humans. Gender marking is covert on nouns, but appears in agreement on verbs, adjectives, pronouns, and adverbial constructions.&lt;ref name=VDB1995/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Class !! Sg. !! Pl.
|-
| align="center" | I   || '''∅-''' || rowspan ="2" | '''b-'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| align="center" | II  || '''j-'''
|-
| align="center" | III || '''j-''' || rowspan ="3" | '''r-'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| align="center" | IV  || '''b-'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| align="center" | V   || '''r-'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|}
# When preceding a nasalized vowel, class markers '''b-''' and '''r-''' surface as '''m-''' and '''n-''' respectively.

===Nouns===
Nouns in Hunzib come in five [[noun class]]es: male, female, and three classes for inanimate objects. There are a number of [[declension|cases]] in Hunzib, including the [[absolutive case|absolutive]], [[ergative case|ergative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]]. A number of other case-like markers indicate direction and include dative, adessive, superessive, contactive, comitative and allative declensions. The following are taken from [[Helma van den Berg]]'s ''A Grammar of Hunzib''.&lt;ref name=VDB1995&gt;Berg, Helma van den, ''A Grammar of Hunzib (with Texts and Lexicon)'' (Lincom Europa, München 1995) {{ISBN|3-89586-006-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Case====
Hunzib has four basic grammatical cases, the [[Absolutive case|absolutive]], [[Ergative case|ergative]], [[Genitive case|genitive]], and [[Instrumental case|instrumental]]. The absolutive case is formed from the base stem, and the other cases are formed from the oblique stem.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Case         !! Marker
|-
| Absolutive   || -∅
|-
| Ergative     ||-l&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; / -lo&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, -y
|-
| Genitive     || -s
|-
| Instrumental || -d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; / -do&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|}
&lt;small&gt;
# After vowels
# After consonants
&lt;/small&gt;

Hunzib also has a series of local cases, where localizations are combined with directional suffixes. The [[dative case|dative]] and [[Adessive case|adessive]] cases have syntactic functions as well, but are morphologically local.
{| class="wikitable"
! Localization !! Marker !! [[Elative case|Elative]] !! [[Translative case|Translative]]
|-
|Dative || -V&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || -V&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-sə || -V&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-ƛʼ(i)
|-
| [[Adessive case|Adessive]] || -g(o) || -go-s || ***
|-
| [[Superessive case|Superessive]] || -ƛʼ(o) || -ƛo-s || -ƛʼo-ƛʼ
|-
| [[Subessive case|Subessive]] || -ƛ || (-ƛ-sə) || ***
|-
| Contacting || -λ || -λ-sə || -λ-ƛʼi
|-
| [[Comitative case|Comitative]] || -ǧur || -ǧur-sə || -ǧur-ƛʼi
|-
| [[Allative case|Allative]] || -dər || -dər-sə || -dər-ƛʼi
|-
| Approximative || -do || -do-V
|}
# The vowel in these forms will be a duplicate of the vowel in the syllable to which it attaches.

====Oblique stem====
Cases other than the absolutive are formed by attaching the relevant case marker to an oblique stem, which is often the base stem plus some lexically determined extension.

{| class="wikitable"
! Extension !! Notes !! Extension !! Notes
|-
| -li || Productive; found more with nouns ending in a consonant || -ba || Rare 
|-
| -a  || Common; with nouns ending in a consonant or vowel (but ''esp.'' -u) || -y || Rare
|-
| -lo || Common; mostly with nouns ending in -i || -ɑ/e/o/u || Rare
|-
| -yo || Common; mostly with nouns ending in -i || -la || Rare
|-
| -i  || Common; mostly with nouns ending in a vowel || -mo || Rare
|-
| -bo || Common; with nouns ending in a consonant or vowel || -di/u/o || Rare
|-
| -ra/o/u || Rare || ||
|-
| -tʼu || Rare || ||
|}

Some nouns (around 7%) do not use any extension and the oblique and base stems are identical. These words generally end in a vowel, like ''"father"'' &lt;small&gt;ABS&lt;/small&gt; ['''ɑbu]''', &lt;small&gt;GEN&lt;/small&gt; ['''ɑbu-s]'''. A small number of Hunzib nouns exhibit stem alternation, like ''"moon"'' &lt;small&gt;ABS&lt;/small&gt; ['''bo{{IPA|t͡s}}o]''', &lt;small&gt;GEN&lt;/small&gt; ['''bɨ{{IPA|t͡s}}ə]'''.

===Verbs===
Most verbs agree in class and number with the noun in the phrase that is in the absolutive case. As Hunzib has ergative alignment, that equals the subject of intransitive sentences and the direct object of transitive sentences.

===Word order===
Hunzib usually follows a [[subject–object–verb]] word order.

The term '''Ibero-Caucasian''' (or '''Iberian-Caucasian''') was proposed by [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] linguist [[Arnold Chikobava]] for the union of the three language families that are specific to the Caucasus, namely

* '''[[Kartvelian languages|South Caucasian]]''', also called Kartvelian.
* '''[[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]]''', also called Circassian
* '''[[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]]''', also called Nakho–Dagestanian.

The Ibero-Caucasian phylum would also include three extinct languages: [[Hattic language|Hattic]], connected by some linguists to the Northwest (Circassian) family, and [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] and [[Urartian language|Urartian]], connected to the Northeast (Nakh–Dagestanian) family.

== Family status ==
The affinities between the three families are disputed.  A connection between the Northeast and Northwest families is seen as likely by many linguists; see the article on the [[North Caucasian languages]] for details.

On the other hand, there are no known affinities between South Caucasian and the northern languages, which are two unrelated phyla even in [[Joseph H. Greenberg|Greenberg]]'s deep classification of the world's languages.  "Ibero-Caucasian" therefore remains at best a convenient geographical designation.

== Family name ==
The "Iberian" in the family name refers to [[Caucasian Iberia]] — a kingdom centered in Eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] which lasted from the 4th century BC to the 5th century AD, and is not related to the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

In [[medicine]], an '''indication''' is a valid reason to use a certain test, medication, procedure, or surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mw4.m-w.com/medical/indication |title=Indication - Medical Definition and More from Merriam-Webster |access-date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can be multiple indications to use a procedure or medication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An indication can commonly be confused with the term diagnosis. A diagnosis is a particular [medical] condition while an indication is a reason for use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wolterskluwercdi.com/blog/what%E2%80%99s-value-drug-indication/|title=What’s the Value of the Drug Indication? {{!}} Clinical Drug Information|website=www.wolterskluwercdi.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of an indication is a [[contraindication]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mw4.m-w.com/medical/contraindication |title=Contraindication - Medical Definition and More from Merriam-Webster |access-date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reason to withhold a certain medical treatment because the risks of treatment clearly outweigh the benefits.

In the United States, medication indications are determined by the [[FDA]] and are grouped into either labeled indications, which are FDA-approved or off-label indications which are not approved. Currently in the US, including the indication or purpose of use for a drug is not required on prescription labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kron|first=Kevin|last2=Myers|first2=Sara|last3=Volk|first3=Lynn|last4=Nathan|first4=Aaron|last5=Neri|first5=Pamela|last6=Salazar|first6=Alejandra|last7=Amato|first7=Mary G.|last8=Wright|first8=Adam|last9=Karmiy|first9=Sam|date=2018-06-01|title=Incorporating medication indications into the prescribing process|url=http://www.ajhp.org/content/75/11/774|journal=American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy|language=en|volume=75|issue=11|pages=774–783|doi=10.2146/ajhp170346|issn=1079-2082|pmid=29674327}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, manufacturers of [[Prescription drug|prescription drugs]] are required to include an "Indications and usage" section on the [[prescribing information]] or [[package insert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=201.57|title=CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21|website=www.accessdata.fda.gov|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Drugs==
{{globalize|section|date=November 2017}}
Most countries and jurisdictions have a licensing body whose duty is to determine whether to approve a drug for a specific indication, based on the relative ''safety'' of the drug and its ''efficacy'' for the particular use. In the United States, indications for medications are regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and are included in the [[package insert]] under the phrase "Indications and Usage". The [[European Medicines Agency]] ([[European Medicines Agency|EMA]]) holds this responsibility for centrally authorized drugs in the [[European Union]].

=== Label Indications vs. Off-Label Indications ===
In the United States there are label indications and off-label indications&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicinenet.com/indications_for_drugs__approved_vs_non-approved/views.htm|title=Indications for Drugs: Approved vs. Non-approved by MedicineNet.com|work=MedicineNet|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Label indications:''

Medication that have label indications mean that they were approved by the FDA. This means that they are [[Clinical significance|clinically significant]] for the indication and manufacturers are allowed to market their drug for the indication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A drug can have more than one FDA labeled indication, this means they can be used for multiple medical conditions.&lt;ref name="pmid26335981"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Salmasian H, Tran TH, Chase HS, Friedman C | title = Medication-indication knowledge bases: a systematic review and critical appraisal | journal = Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 1261–70 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26335981 | pmc = 5009909 | doi = 10.1093/jamia/ocv129 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the evidence and consensus for use of the drug increases and strengthens, its class of indication is improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68056687|title=Off-Label Use - MeSH Result|publisher=[[Medical Subject Headings]]|access-date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preferred drugs (and other treatments) are also referred to a "[[Therapy|first line]]" or "primary" while others are called "second line", "third line" etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/second-line+drug|title=second-line drug|website=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=346494|title=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms|website=National Cancer Institute|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A drug may be indicated as an "adjunct" or "[[Adjuvant therapy|adjuvant]]", added to a first line drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=adjunct|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/adjunct|journal=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Off-label:''

Off-label indications are drugs that are used for medical indications that have not been approved by the FDA. Off label indications often have some clinical significance to back the use, but they have not gone through the extensive testing required by the FDA to have an official labeled indication. Drug companies can not provide any official medication information (e.g [[Medication package insert|package inserts]]) for off label indications. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== FDA approval ===
The purpose for adding FDA-approved indications in the United States is to ensure that healthcare providers can easily identify appropriate use of drug therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM612697.pdf|title=Indications and Usage Section of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products — Content and Format |website=fda.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaining FDA approval is based on the body of scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of a drug treatment. The scientific evidence is gathered in the first 3 steps in the drug development process: discovery and development, pre-clinical research (testing safety), and clinical research (testing efficacy)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Approvals/Drugs/default.htm|title=The Drug Development Process|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After there is adequate completion of research and development phases by the drug companies, they send a [[New Drug Application|New Drug Application (NDA)]] for approval to the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the proposed scientific evidence for use in an intended population is evaluated by a team of physicians, statisticians, chemists, pharmacologists, and other scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/default.htm |title=Development &amp; Approval Process (Drugs) | author = Center for Drug Evaluation and Research |website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/howdrugsaredevelopedandapproved/approvalapplications/newdrugapplicationnda/default.htm|title=New Drug Application (NDA) | author = Center for Drug Evaluation and Research | website=www.fda.gov |access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, if it is found that there is substantial evidence that benefits of treatment outweigh the risks, the proposed labeling in the [[Medication package insert|package insert]] is appropriate, and the manufacturing process is safe and adequate, then the drug is approved to go to market under that now FDA-approved indication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/howdrugsaredevelopedandapproved/approvalapplications/newdrugapplicationnda/default.htm|title=New Drug Application (NDA) | author =Center for Drug Evaluation and Research |website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after approval, the FDA CDER continues to do postmarking surveillance of the drug through [[MedWatch]] and [[Adverse Event Reporting System|FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/surveillance/ucm090385.htm |title=Surveillance - Postmarketing Surveillance Programs | author =Center for Drug Evaluation and Research |website=www.fda.gov |access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on Drug Pricing ===
Indications can impact pricing of medications through [[Value-based pricing|Value-based Pricing]], also known as indication specific pricing or indication value-based pricing.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Pearson SD, Dreitlein B, Henshall C. [https://icer-review.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Final-Report-2015-ICER-Policy-Summit-on-Indication-specific-Pricing-March-2016_revised-icons-002.pdf Indication-specific pricing of pharmaceuticals in the United States health care system: a report from the 2015 ICER Membership Policy Summit]. Boston: Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, March 2016. &lt;/ref&gt; Since drugs can be used for different indications, this form of pricing would set different prices for each indication based on the value the drug offers for whatever it is being used to treat.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This pricing scheme is often discussed in relation to [[oncology]] drugs, which are costly and not always successful in treating patients.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Oncology drugs can be used for multiple different types of cancers so by applying indication-specific pricing, the drug would be priced based on how effective it is for treating each type of cancer. If the drug is more effective for Cancer A than Cancer B, then the patient taking the drug to treat Cancer A will pay more than the person using it for Cancer B because they are getting more value out of it.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; 

Currently, most medications in the United States are priced the same regardless of what they're being used for or how effective they are at improving outcomes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Companies like CVS and Express Scripts in the US have began implementing pricing based on indication&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.managedcaremag.com/archives/2018/5/indication-specific-drug-pricing-simple-theory-complex-reality|title=Indication-Specific Drug Pricing – Simple in Theory, Complex in Reality|date=2018-05-06|work=Managed Care magazine|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in countries like Italy, similar forms of pricing are already being used.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|vauthors=Flume M, Bardou M, Capri S, Sola-Morales O, Cunningham D, Levin LA, Touchot N|date=January 2016|title=Feasibility and attractiveness of indication value-based pricing in key EU countries|url=|journal=Journal of Market Access &amp; Health Policy|volume=4|issue=1|pages=30970|doi=10.3402/jmahp.v4.30970|pmc=4864834|pmid=27226845|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Express Scripts' "Oncology Care Value Program," uses indication-based pricing for certain oncology medications and was launched in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lab.express-scripts.com/lab/insights/drug-options/safeguardrx-improves-affordability-and-access-to-budget-busting-drugs|title=SafeGuardRx Improves Affordability and Access to Budget-Busting Drugs {{!}} Express Scripts|website=lab.express-scripts.com|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy on the other hand, uses a model similar to indication-based pricing where the amount the hospital pays for certain drugs varies based on what it's used for.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Patients can receive reimbursements for treatments based on their response and either be fully or partially refunded.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Italy's reimbursement system is run by AIFA, the Italian Medicines Agency, which is the national authority that regulates drugs in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agenziafarmaco.gov.it/en/node/4111|title=The Italian Medicines Agency {{!}} AIFA Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco|website=www.agenziafarmaco.gov.it|language=en|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Incorporating Indication of Use on Prescription Drug Labels ===
There has been some thought on incorporating the indication of use on prescription drug labels as an approach to improve patient understanding of the medications they are on. This information can help healthcare providers reduce medication errors related to drugs that may look and sound alike.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Knowing the indication of the drug can also help providers determine if the dose of the drug is appropriate per indication, and this can greatly improve patient safety and drug effectiveness.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schiff GD, Seoane-Vazquez E, Wright A | title = Incorporating Indications into Medication Ordering--Time to Enter the Age of Reason | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 375 | issue = 4 | pages = 306–9 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27464201 | doi = 10.1056/nejmp1603964 | url = https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1603964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are still some challenges with incorporating the indication of use on prescription drug labels. Revealing the indication of use on prescription drug labels can breach patient confidentiality since the label will disclose private information publicly.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Some medications can also be used for multiple diseases and one disease may have multiple medications for its prevention or treatment, therefore adding an indication on prescription labels in these cases may cause some confusion and may not be able to actually fit onto the label.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drugtopics.com/latest/case-indications-prescriptions/page/0/1|title=The Case for Indications on Prescriptions |website=Drug Topics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Medical tests==
{{Further|Indications of medical tests}}
Each test has its own indications and contraindications, but in a simplified fashion, how much a test is indicated for an individual depends largely on its ''net benefit'' for that individual, which largely depends on the absolute difference between [[pre- and post-test probability]] of conditions (such as diseases) that the test is expected to achieve. Additional factors that influence a decision whether a medical test should be performed or not include: cost of the test, time taken for the test or other practical or administrative aspects. The possible benefits of a diagnostic test may also be weighed against the costs of unnecessary tests and resulting unnecessary follow-up and possibly even unnecessary treatment of incidental findings.&lt;ref name="pmid12783911"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jarvik JG, Hollingworth W, Martin B, Emerson SS, Gray DT, Overman S, Robinson D, Staiger T, Wessbecher F, Sullivan SD, Kreuter W, Deyo RA | title = Rapid magnetic resonance imaging vs radiographs for patients with low back pain: a randomized controlled trial | journal = Jama | volume = 289 | issue = 21 | pages = 2810–8 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12783911 | doi = 10.1001/jama.289.21.2810 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, even if not beneficial for the individual being tested, the results may be useful for the establishment of statistics in order to improve health care for other individuals.

In [[botany]], an '''infraspecific name''' is the [[scientific name]] for any [[taxon]] below the [[rank (taxonomy)|rank]] of [[species (biology)|species]], i.e. an '''infraspecific taxon'''. (A "taxon", plural "taxa", is a group of organisms to be given a particular name.) The scientific names of botanical taxa are regulated by the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (ICN).&lt;ref name=icb&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This specifies a 'three part name' for infraspecific taxa, plus a 'connecting term' to indicate the rank of the name.&lt;ref name=icb24&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 24&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a name is ''Astrophytum myriostigma'' subvar. ''glabrum'', the name of a subvariety of the species ''[[Astrophytum myriostigma]]'' (bishop's hat cactus).

Names below the rank of species of cultivated kinds of plants and of animals are regulated by different codes of nomenclature and are formed somewhat differently.

==Construction of infraspecific names==

Article 24 of the ICN describes how infraspecific names are constructed.&lt;ref name="icb24"/&gt; The order of the three parts of an infraspecific name is:
:genus name, specific epithet, connecting term indicating the rank (not part of the name, but required), infraspecific epithet.
It is customary to italicize all three parts of such a name, but not the connecting term.&lt;ref&gt;See the examples in {{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 24&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
* ''Acanthocalycium klimpelianum'' var. ''macranthum''
:genus name = ''Acanthocalycium'', specific epithet = ''klimpelianum'', connecting term = var. (short for "varietas" or [[variety (botany)|variety]]), infraspecific epithet = ''macranthum''

*''Astrophytum myriostigma'' subvar. ''glabrum''
:genus name = ''Astrophytum'', specific epithet = ''myriostigma'', connecting term = subvar. (short for "subvarietas" or subvariety), infraspecific epithet = ''glabrum''

The recommended abbreviations for ranks below species are, for example:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 4; abbreviations from Recommendation 5A&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[subspecies]] - recommended abbreviation: subsp. (but "ssp." is also in use although not recognised by Art 26)
* varietas ([[variety (botany)|variety]]) - recommended abbreviation: var.
* subvarietas ([[subvariety]]) -  recommended abbreviation: subvar.
* forma ([[form (botany)|form]]) -  recommended abbreviation: f.
* subforma (subform) -  recommended abbreviation: subf.

== Abbreviation of infraspecific names ==

Like specific epithets, infraspecific epithets cannot be used in isolation as names.&lt;ref name=icbn241&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 24.1&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the name of a particular species of ''Acanthocalycium'' is ''Acanthocalycium klimpelianum'', which can be abbreviated to ''A. klimpelianum'' where the context makes the genus clear. The species cannot be referred to as just ''klimpelianum''. In the same way, the name of a particular variety of ''Acanthocalycium klimpelianum'' is ''Acanthocalycium klimpelianum'' var. ''macranthum'', which can be abbreviated to ''A. k.'' var. ''macranthum'' where the context makes the species clear. The variety cannot be referred to as just ''macranthum''.

Sometimes more than three parts will be given; strictly speaking, this is not a name, but a [[Scientific classification|classification]]. The ICN gives the example of ''Saxifraga aizoon'' var. ''aizoon'' subvar. ''brevifolia'' f. ''multicaulis'' subf. ''surculosa''; the name of the subform would be ''Saxifraga aizoon'' subf. ''surculosa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 24.1, Ex. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legitimate infraspecific names==

For a proposed infraspecific name to be legitimate it must be in accordance with all the rules of the ICN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Appendix VII Glossary of terms used and defined in this Code, entry for "legitimate"&lt;/ref&gt; Only some of the main points are described here.

A key concept in botanical names is that of a [[type (biology)|type]]. In many cases the type will be a particular preserved specimen stored in a [[herbarium]], although there are other kinds of type. Like other names, an infraspecific name is attached to a type. Whether a plant should be given a particular infraspecific name can then be decided by comparing it to the type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no requirement for a species to be divided into infraspecific taxa, of whatever rank; in other words, a species does not have to have subspecies, varieties, forms, etc. However, if infraspecific ranks are created, then the name of the type of the species must repeat the specific epithet as its infraspecific epithet. The type acquires this name automatically as soon as any infraspecific rank is created.&lt;ref name=icbn26&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 26&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, consider ''[[Poa secunda]]'' &lt;small&gt;J.Presl&lt;/small&gt;, whose type specimen is in the Wisconsin State Herbarium.&lt;ref name=wsh&gt;{{Citation |title=Wisconsin Botanical Information System: Type Specimens |publisher=Wisconsin State Herbarium, University of Wisconsin |url=http://www.botany.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/searchspecimen.cgi?typeSpecimen=1 |accessdate=2011-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As soon as a subspecies of ''Poa secunda''  was created, then the type specimen of ''P. secunda''  immediately became the type specimen of ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''secunda''. The name "''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''secunda''" was automatically created (it is an "autonym"). Soreng created the subspecies ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''juncifolia'' (whose type specimen is also in the Wisconsin State Herbarium),&lt;ref name=wsh/&gt; thereby making the type specimen of ''P. secunda'' also the type specimen of ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''secunda''.
* If in addition to the subspecies any variety of ''Poa secunda'' were to be created, then the type specimen of ''P. secunda''  would automatically become the type specimen of ''Poa secunda'' var. ''secunda''. The type specimen would then have the classification ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''secunda'' var. ''secunda''.

The same epithet can be used again within a species, at whatever level, only if the names with the re-used epithet are attached to the same type.&lt;ref name=icbn26/&gt; Thus there can be a form called ''Poa secunda'' f. ''juncifolia'' as well as the subspecies ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''juncifolia'' if, and only if, the type specimen of ''Poa secunda'' f. ''juncifolia'' is the same as the type specimen of ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''juncifolia'' (in other words, if there is a single type specimen whose classification is ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''juncifolia'' f. ''juncifolia'').

If two infraspecific taxa which have different types are accidentally given the same epithet, then a [[Homonym (biology)|homonym]] has been created. The earliest published name is the legitimate one and the other must be changed.&lt;ref name=icbn53&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 53.4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifying authors==
When indicating authors for infraspecific names, it is possible to show either just the author(s) of the final, infraspecific epithet, or the authors of both the specific and the infraspecific epithets.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Examples:

*''Adenia aculeata'' subsp. ''inermis'' de Wilde
:This identifies de Wilde as the author who published this name for the subspecies (i.e. who created the epithet ''inermis''). Note that here it was decided not to indicate authority for the species.
*''Pinus nigra'' J.F.Arnold subsp. ''salzmannii'' (Dunal) Franco
:Here, J.F.Arnold is the author who gave the species, [[European black pine]], its botanical name ''Pinus nigra''; Dunal is the author who was the first to publish the epithet ''salzmanii'' for this taxon (as the species ''Pinus salzmanii''); Franco is the author who reduced the taxon to a subspecies of ''Pinus nigra''.

==Difference from zoological nomenclature==
In [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|zoological nomenclature]], names of taxa below species rank are formed somewhat differently, using a [[trinomen]] or 'trinomial name'. No connecting term is required as there is only one rank below species, the [[subspecies]].

==Cultivated plants==
The ''ICN'' does not regulate the names of cultivated plants, of [[cultivar]]s, i.e. plants specifically created for use in agriculture or horticulture. Such names are regulated by the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]]'' (ICNCP).

Although logically below the rank of species (and hence "infraspecific"), a [[cultivar]] name may be attached to any scientific name at the genus level or below. The minimum requirement is to specify a genus name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brickell, C.D.; Alexander, C.; David, J.C.; Hetterscheid, W.L.A.; Leslie, A.C.; Malecot, V.; Jin, X.; Editorial committee; Cubey, J.J. |year=2009  |title=International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP or Cultivated Plant Code) incorporating the Rules and Recommendations for naming plants in cultivation, Eighth Edition, Adopted by the International Union of Biological Sciences International Commission for the Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants |publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy and International Society for Horticultural  Science   |url=http://www.actahort.org/chronica/pdf/sh_10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''Achillea'' 'Cerise Queen' is a cultivar; ''Pinus nigra'' 'Arnold Sentinel' is a cultivar of the species ''P.&amp;nbsp;nigra'' (which is propagated vegetatively, by [[cloning]]).

'''Junjiahua''', '''Junhua''' or '''Junsheng''' refers to a collection of isolated dialects in [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Hainan]], [[Fujian]], and [[Taiwan]] region. Some believe that they are a [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] dialect group that assimilated to local Chinese variants in southern China. Junhua began as a [[lingua franca]] in the army, being spoken between soldiers from all parts of China during the [[Ming dynasty]]. It was subsequently spread to areas around the camps where the army settled. It is now an [[endangered language]]. In [[Hainan]], it's still spoken by about 100,000 people. These speakers mainly live in [[Sanya]], [[Changjiang Li Autonomous County]], [[Danzhou]], [[Dongfang, Hainan|Dongfang]] and [[Lingao County|Lingao]].

Some also consider the [[Dapeng dialect|Dapenghua]] spoken in [[Dapeng Peninsula]] of [[Shenzhen]] to be a form of Junjiahua.

'''Khwaja Ghulam Farid Korejo ''' ([[Urdu]]: {{Nastaliq|خواجہ غُلام فرید کوریجو}}) or '''Khwaja Farid''' (1845–1901) was a 19th-century [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cI1_AgAAQBAJ|title=Muslim Saints of South Asia: The Eleventh to Fifteenth Centuries (Islamic calendar)|first=Anna|last=Suvorova|date=22 July 2004|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sufi]] [[poet]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. He was a scholar and writer who knew several different languages.&lt;ref name=paknetmag/&gt; He belonged to [[Chishti|Chishti–Nizami]] [[Sufi order]]. He was born in and died at [[Chachran]] town and was buried at [[Mithankot]], Punjab, Pakistan.&lt;ref name=paknetmag/&gt;

==Early life and career==
His mother died when he was four years old and he was orphaned around the age of twelve when his father, Khwaja Khuda Bakhsh, died. He was then brought up by his elder brother, Khwaja Fakhr-ud-Din, and grew up to become a scholar and writer. He mastered [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Saraiki dialect|Saraiki]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], and [[Braj Bhasha]], and also wrote poems in Punjabi, Urdu, Sindhi, Persian, and Braj Bhasha languages.&lt;ref name=paknetmag/&gt;

Nawab [[Sadeq Mohammad Khan V]] of [[Bahawalpur]] took Khwaja Farid to his palace at [[Ahmad pur sharkia]] for his religious education by a scholar, when he was 8 years old.&lt;ref name=paknetmag/&gt;
His elder brother Khwaja Fakhr-ud-Din who had brought him up after his parents' deaths, also died when Khwaja Ghulam Farid was 28 years old. Khwaja Farid then left for ''Rohi area'' or [[Cholistan Desert]] and lived 18 years there.&lt;ref name=paknetmag/&gt;

Khwaja Ghulam Farid Korejo performed [[Hajj]], [[Islamic]] [[Pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]], in 1876.&lt;ref name=paknetmag/&gt;

==Publications==
His most significant works include:
* ''Deewan-e-Farid'' (poem collection in Multani, 1882; in Punjabi, 1883 ; in Urdu, 1884)&lt;ref name=paknetmag/&gt;
:Khwaja Farid composed as many as 272 [[kafi]]s of high literary merit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/1063376 A Khwaja Ghulam Farid anniversary] Dawn (newspaper), Published 20 July 2002, Retrieved 15 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Manaqabe Mehboobia'' (in Persian prose)
* ''Fawaid Faridia (in Persian prose)

:In his poetry, he frequently uses the symbolism of a desert. Sometimes he touched the topic of political affairs, opposing the British rule in [[Bahawalpur]] state.

==Awards, recognition and legacy==
*The 20th century saw development of an entire branch of literary studies into the life and work of Khwaja Ghulam Farid Korejo, named ''faridiyat''. 
*Today, many religious and educational institutions in Pakistan and India are named after him (e.g., [[Government Khawaja Farid College]] in [[Rahimyar Khan]], Pakistan) as are streets and town living quarters. 
*A literary award named after him, ''Khwaja Ghulam Farid Award'' is awarded yearly by the [[Pakistan Academy of Letters]] in literature, its recipients including [[Ismail Ahmedani]] (in 2013) and Irshad Taunsvi (in 2007) among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nation.com.pk/E-Paper/Lahore/2013-12-19/page-14/detail-10 |title=Pakistan Academy of Letters (PAL) confers awards on literary figures|author=Amir Jalil Bobra|date=19 December 2013|publisher=The Nation (newspaper)|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://apnaorg.com/announcement/pal/ PAL announces National Literary Awards] Academy of the Punjab in North America website, Published 10 August 2007, Retrieved 15 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kim''' of southern [[Chad]] is an [[Mbum–Day languages|Mbum language]] spoken by 15,000 people. It is one of the three members of the [[Kim languages]] group, together with [[Besme language|Besme]] and [[Goundo language|Goundo]].

The language was once mistakenly classified as [[Chadic language|Chadic]], and called ''[[Masa language|Masa]]'', a Chadic name.

'''Kobaïan''' is a [[artistic language|lyrical language]] created by French drummer and composer [[Christian Vander (musician)|Christian Vander]] for his [[progressive rock]] band [[Magma (band)|Magma]].{{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=629}}{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=1976}}&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; It is the language of '''Kobaïa''', a [[Planets in science fiction|fictional planet]] invented by Vander and the setting for a musical "[[space opera]]" sung in Kobaïan by Magma on ten [[concept album]]s.&lt;ref name=Wire-p2/&gt;&lt;ref name=TinyMixTapes/&gt;&lt;ref name=AMG/&gt;

==Development==
French drummer and composer [[Christian Vander (musician)|Christian Vander]] formed [[progressive rock]] band [[Magma (band)|Magma]] in late 1969 in an attempt to fill the void left by the death of American jazz musician and composer [[John Coltrane]].&lt;ref name=Wire-p2/&gt; Magma's first album, ''[[Magma (Magma album)|Magma]]'' (later reissued as ''Kobaïa''), told a story of refugees fleeing a future Earth and settling on a [[Planets in science fiction|fictional planet]] called Kobaïa.&lt;ref name=PSF/&gt; The lyrics were all in Kobaïan, a language Vander constructed for the album, some sung by soloists and others by "massive quasi-operatic choruses".&lt;ref name=Wire-p2/&gt; Over the next three decades Magma made a further nine albums that continued the mythology of Kobaïa, all sung in Kobaïan.&lt;ref name=TinyMixTapes/&gt;

Vander (his Kobaïan name is Zëbëhn Straïn dë Ğeuštaah) said in an interview that he invented Kobaïan for Magma because "French just wasn't expressive enough. Either for the story or for the sound of the music".&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wire-p4/&gt; He said that the language developed in parallel with the music, that sounds appeared as he was composing on a piano.&lt;ref name=DrummerWorld/&gt; Vander based Kobaïan in part on elements of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] and [[Germanic languages]] and in part on the [[Scat singing|scat]]-[[yodeling]] vocal style of American [[Avant-garde music|avant garde]] jazz singer [[Leon Thomas]].&lt;ref name=Wire-p2/&gt; The subsequent expansion of the language became a group effort, and as Magma's personnel changed, so new ideas were incorporated into the language (and the music).&lt;ref name=PSF/&gt;

British music critic [[Ian MacDonald]] said that Kobaïan is "[[Phonetics|phonetic]], not [[Semantics|semantic]]", and that it is based on "[[Sonority hierarchy|sonorities]], not on applied meanings".&lt;ref name=MacDonald/&gt; One of Magma's singers, Klaus Blasquiz, described Kobaïan as "a language of the heart" whose words are "inseparable from the music".&lt;ref name=MacDonald/&gt; Magma expert Michael Draine said "the abstraction provided by the Kobaïan verse seems to inspire Magma's singers to heights of emotional abandon rarely permitted by conventional lyrics".&lt;ref name=Wire-p2/&gt;

The Kobaïan lyrics on Magma's albums were generally not translated (though both Kobaïan lyrics and an English translation were provided for the first UK release on A&amp;M of ''[[Mëkanïk Dëstruktïẁ Kömmandöh]]''), but clues to the unfolding story of Kobaïa were given in French in the albums' [[liner notes]]. While the original intent of the language was to avoid over-scrutiny, unofficial Kobaïan online [[lexicon]]s were created by Magma fans, and Vander himself has since translated many of the words.&lt;ref name=TinyMixTapes/&gt;

==Influence==
[[Christian Vander (musician)|Christian Vander]] called [[Magma (band)|Magma]]'s music "[[Zeuhl]]" (Kobaïan for "celestial"),&lt;ref name=Wire-p3/&gt; and it influenced a number of other (mostly French) bands, including [[Zao (French band)|Zao]] (France), [[Art Zoyd]] (France) and [[Univers Zero]] (Belgium).{{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=630}} Zeuhl later became a [[music genre]] which was used to describe music similar to that of Magma.&lt;ref name=Gibraltar/&gt;&lt;ref name=LastFM/&gt; Several Japanese Zeuhl bands also sprang up, including [[Ruins (Japanese band)|Ruins]] and [[Kōenji Hyakkei]], whose lyrics are also sung in a [[constructed language]] similar to Kobaïan.&lt;ref name=TinyMixTapes/&gt;

The '''Ladakhi language''' ({{bo|t=ལ་དྭགས་སྐད་|w=La-dwags skat}}), also called '''Bhoti''' or '''Bodhi''', is a [[Tibetic language]] spoken in the [[Ladakh]] region of [[India]]. It is the predominant language in the [[Buddhist]]-dominated district of [[Leh district|Leh]] of the [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir]] state and may be called ''Purigi'' or ''Balti'' in the adjacent [[Kargil district]]. Though a member of the Tibetic family, Ladakhi is not mutually intelligible with [[Standard Tibetan]].

Ladakhi has approximately 200,000 speakers in India, and perhaps 12,000 speakers in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of [[China]], mostly in the [[Qiangtang]] region. Ladakhi has several dialects: ''Lehskat'' after [[Leh]], where it is spoken; ''Shamskat'', spoken in the northwest of Leh; ''Stotskat'', spoken in the Indus valley and which is tonal unlike the others; ''Nubra'', spoken in the north of Leh; ''Purigi''/''Balti'' spoken in the Kargil district. The significant difference in the dialects remain in the tone or way of speaking. The varieties spoken in Upper Ladakh and [[Zangskar]] have many features of Ladakhi and also western dialects of [[Central Tibetan language|Central Tibetan]].

Ladakhi has seen a huge drop in identification as a mother tongue, from 100,000 in the 2001 census to 14,000 in the 2011 census, despite positive language attitudes in the community and vigorous use of the language by all age groups in most contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011Census/Language-2011/Statement-8.pdf|title=Growth of Non-Scheduled languages - 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001, and 2011|last=|first=|date=|website=Census of India|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
[[Nicolas Tournadre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nicolas |last=Tournadre |authorlink=Nicolas Tournadre |year=2005 |title=L'aire linguistique tibétaine et ses divers dialectes |work=Lalies |volume=25 |pages=7–56 |url=http://tournadre.nicolas.free.fr/fichiers/2005-aire.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; considers Ladakhi, [[Balti dialect|Balti]], and [[Purik language|Purgi]] to be distinct languages on the basis of [[mutual intelligibility]] (Zangskari is not as distinct.) As a group they are termed '''Ladakhi–Balti''' or '''Western Archaic Tibetan''', as opposed to Western Innovative Tibetan languages such as [[Spiti Bhoti]] (Lahuli–Spiti) spoken in Himachal Pradesh.

===Zanskari===
[[Zangskari dialect|Zangskari]] is a dialect of Ladakhi and has four subdialects, Stod, Zhung, Sham, and Lungna. It is written using the Tibetan script.

==Script==
Ladakhi is usually written using [[Tibetan script]] with the pronunciation of Ladakhi being much closer to written [[Classical Tibetan]] than most other [[Tibetic languages]]. Ladakhis pronounce many of the prefix, suffix and head letters that are silent in many other Tibetic languages, such as [[Amdo Tibetan|Amdo]], [[Khams Tibetan language|Khams]], and [[Central Tibetan language|Central Tibetan]]. This tendency is more pronounced to the west of Leh, and on the Pakistani side of the [[Line of Control]], in [[Baltistan]]. For example, a Tibetan would pronounce ''sta'' 'axe' as [tá], but a Lehpa would say [sta],and a purgi would pronounce [stare].  While a Tibetan would pronounce འབྲས་ (’bras) 'rice' as [ɳʈɛ́ʔ], Lehpa say [ɖas], and the purgii pronounce it as [bras].

The question of whether to write colloquial Ladakhi in the Tibetan script or to write only a slightly Ladakhified version of [[Classical Tibetan]] is controversial in Ladakh.&lt;ref name="van Beek"&gt;{{cite book|title=Tibetan Modernities: Notes from the Field on Cultural and Social Change|editor1-first=Robert|editor1-last=Barnett|editor2-first=Ronald David|editor2-last=Schwartz|publisher=Brill|year=2008|chapter=Imaginaries of Ladakhi Modernity|pages=178–179|first=Martijn|last=van Beek}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim Ladakhis speak Ladakhi but most do not read the Tibetan script and most Buddhist Ladakhis can sound out the Tibetan script but do not understand Classical Tibetan, but some Ladakhi Buddhist scholars insist that Ladakhi must be written only in a form of Classical Tibetan. A limited number of books and magazines have been published in colloquial Ladakhi.

Written Ladakhi is most often romanised using modified [[Wylie transliteration]], with a ''th'' denoting an [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] dental ''t,'' for example.

==Recognition==
The [[medium of instruction]] in most schools in Ladakh is [[English language|English]], with either [[Hindi language|Hindi]] or [[Urdu language|Urdu]] as a compulsory second language, and a choice of Arabic or classical Tibetan as the compulsory third language. Government schools in Ladakh are under [[Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education|JK SBOSE]], which calls the Tibetan subject Bodhi. Private schools under the [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]] and the [[Central Institute of Buddhist Studies, Leh]] call it Tibetan.

A section of Ladakhi society has been demanding inclusion of a newly named language, Bhoti, to be added to the 8th Schedule of the Indian Constitution. They claim that Bhoti is spoken by Ladakhis, Baltis, Tibetans, and throughout the Himalayas from Baltistan to Arunachal Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reachladakh.com/national-seminar-on-bhoti-language-held-at-leh/1891.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Ladakh-council-adopts-new-emblem-replacing-J-K-logo/Article1-667511.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301060545/http://www.hindustantimes.com//ladakh-council-adopts-new-emblem-replacing-j-k-logo/article1-667511.aspx |archivedate=2011-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lingwa de planeta''' (also '''Lidepla''' or '''LdP''') is a [[constructed language|constructed]] [[international auxiliary language]]&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt; based on the most widely spoken languages of the world, including [[Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[Hindi]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unish.org/upload/word/JUL13-1.pdf Journal of Universal Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519040718/http://www.unish.org/upload/word/JUL13-1.pdf |date=2014-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main idea of Lidepla is a harmonious whole on the base of the most widespread and influential [[national language]]s. The intention is also for it to have something in common with the native languages of most of the people. With the various source languages from across the globe, its design is of the type [[worldlang]], a class of [[a posteriori (languages)|a posteriori]] languages.

Development of the language began in 2006 in [[Saint-Petersburg]], [[Russia]], by a group of enthusiasts, with Dmitri Ivanov being the project leader. The basic version of the language was published in June 2010.

== Alphabet and pronunciation ==
The official Lidepla [[alphabet]] is based on the [[Latin script]] and contains the following 25 letters,&lt;ref name="ge"&gt;[http://www.lingwadeplaneta.info/en/anglegram.shtml Grammar with examples], sections:
* ''[http://www.lingwadeplaneta.info/en/anglegram.shtml#alphabetandpronunciatio Alphabet and pronunciation]'' and 
* [http://www.lingwadeplaneta.info/en/anglegram.shtml#stress ''Stress''] (accessed 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; and their upper case equivalents:

|}

The letter ''q'' is not used, and ''c'' occurs only in the digraph “ch”. The letter ''y'' represents the same [[vowel]] as “i”, but is never stressed. The following digraphs and letters are pronounced as follows, with examples:

* '''ch''' – /t͡ʃ/ as in “cheese”: ''chay'' — tea
* '''-ng''', at the end of a word – /ŋ/&lt;ref name="lingwadeplaneta"&gt;[http://lingwadeplaneta.info/files/La%20Riverego%20autuno%202011.pdf Riverego]&lt;/ref&gt; as in ''fang'': ''feng'' — wind
* '''sh''' – /ʃ/ as in “shoes”: ''shi'' — ten
&lt;!--* '''h''' – /x/ as ''ch'' in German ''“Fach”'': ''hao'' – good--&gt;
* '''j''' – /d͡ʒ/ as in “Jack”: ''jan'' — to know
* '''z''' – /d͡z/: ''zun'' — to go in for
* '''x''' – /ks/ as in “extra”: ''examen'' — exam

''-ng-'' in the middle of a word is pronounced /ng/ (as is “ng” in ''finger''). ''&lt;!--ch, h, --&gt;v'' and ending ''-ng'' may alternatively be pronounced as &lt;!-- /h/ (''house''),--&gt; /w/ (as in ''wood'') and /n/ (''nose''), respectively. ''x'' between two vowels may be slightly voiced,{{clarify|the grammar says "preferably as /gs/". Is that fully correct? And if so: why was this elected as preferred pronunciation in that case? would be interesting to know, if there's any source|date=September 2017}} and ''x'' before a consonant pronounced as /s/.

Some learning material uses /h/ for the letter '''h'''.&lt;ref&gt;English Wikibooks course, and: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfItYf-cAig, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUz_mjfqBIY&lt;/ref&gt; The grammar allows that pronunciation, but gives /x/ as ''ch'' in German ''Fach'' as the primary.

For more details on the phonology, see the section [[Lingwa de planeta#Phonology|Phonology]] below.

=== Stress ===
The general rule regarding the [[Stress (linguistics)#Lexical stress|stress]] is: 

* the vowel before the last consonant (or “y”) is stressed: ''máta'' (mother), ''família'' (family), ''akshám'' (evening), ''ruchéy'' (brook)

Lidepla tries to preserve the original sounding of the international words, though, so there are some exceptions, as follows, in short:&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt;

* some endings (''-um, -us, -er, -en; -ik-, -ul-&lt;ref&gt;Do note that ''-fula'' is an ending on its own, not containing the -ul- ending, and thus receives normal stress&lt;/ref&gt;'', and most but not all suffixes&lt;ref name="ge" /&gt;) are never stressed
* the doubled vowel is always stressed (like in ''adyoo'', “bye”)

== Description and grammar ==
The main idea behind Lidepla was to create a harmonious whole on the base of the most widespread and influential [[national language]]s of the planet. That results in the Lidepla vocabulary containing a fairly significant amount of non-European words, which makes Lidepla a [[welttung]]. A general design principle for Lidepla was to have something in common with the native languages of most of the people on Earth.&lt;ref name="journal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ifapcom.ru/files/Documents/multiling_eng.pdf#page=112&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lidepla grammar is based on 3 rules: the rule of the constant form, the rule of belonging to a word class, and the rule of direct word order.

=== Rule of the constant form ===
The [[word form]] never changes. Special particles are used to express the [[grammatical meaning]]s, for example:

* ''me lubi'' – I love
* ''li lubi'' – they love
* ''yu '''ve''' lubi'' – you will love
* ''me '''wud''' lubi'' – I would love
* ''lubi ('''ba''')'' – love!

The only two exceptions are: 
* the '''[[plural]] of nouns''', which is made by adding the suffix '''-s''': ''kitaba'' (book) — ''kitaba''''s''''' (books), ''flor'' (flower) — ''flore'''s''''' (flowers), and

* the verb '''to be''', which has its own forms: ''bi / es / bin''{{clarify|I suppose this is tense conjugation? ~"to be, is, was"?|date=September 2017}}

=== Rule of belonging to a word class ===
Every Lidepla word belongs to a word class – [[noun]], [[verb]], [[adjective]], [[adverb]], etc. [[Derivation (linguistics)|Derivation]] takes place by means of [[affix]]es and [[particle (grammar)|particles]]:&lt;ref name="lingwadeplaneta" /&gt;

* ''lubi'' – to love (verb)
* ''luba'' – love (noun)
* ''lubi-she'' – loving (adjective)
* ''lubi-shem'' – lovingly, with love (adverb)

There are no fixed endings for the word classes, there are preferable, though. Thus most verbs end in '''i''', but there are some exceptions (for example: ''jan'' – to know, shwo'' – to talk, etc).

==== Derivation ====
By means of affixes and particles new words can be made up, both of the same class and of the other.&lt;ref name="lingwadeplaneta" /&gt; For example:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 0 auto;"
|-
| ''somni'' – to sleep
| ''somni-she'' – sleeping
|-
| ''en-somni'' – to fall asleep
| ''somni-shem'' – sleepingly, as if while asleep
|-
| ''somni-ki'' – to doze
| ''somnishil'' – sleepy
|-
| ''gro-somni'' – to be dead to the world
| ''somnilok'' – sleeping place
|-
| ''ek-somni-ki'' – to take a nap
| ''somninik'' – sleepyhead
|}

==== Principle of necessity ====
The use of special particle is optional if its meaning is clear from the [[context (language use)|context]].&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lingwadeplaneta" /&gt; For example:

* ''Yeri me miti ela'' – “Yesterday I met her”, and
* ''Manya me miti ela'' – “Tomorrow I'll meet her”

both lack particles indicating time, because it is already obvious from “yesterday” and “tomorrow”. In the same manner: 

* ''Me vidi mucho kinda'' – “I see a lot of children”

lacks the plural indicating ending ''-s'', because plural is already indicated by ''mucho'', in contrast to:

* ''Me vidi kinda'''s''''' – “I see children”

that uses the plural -s ending.

=== Rule of direct word order ===
The [[word order]] in a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] is usually direct, that is [[subject (grammar)|subject]] — [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] — [[object (grammar)|object]], [[Grammatical modifier|attribute]] goes before the noun, [[preposition]]s are before the noun group they refer to.

If the word order is changed, it is shown by the use of special particles. For example, ''den'' is put before the object,&lt;ref name="lingwadeplaneta" /&gt; like this:

* ''Ela lubi lu'' – “She loves him”, versus
* ''Den lu ela lubi'', with the same meaning (literally “Him she loves”) – where the object ''lu'' is marked by placing ''den'' before it.

=== Personal pronouns ===
The basic personal pronouns of Lidepla are:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
! person
! singular
! plural
|-
! 1
| me
| nu
|-
! 2
| yu
| yu
|-
! rowspan="2" | 3
| ta
| rowspan="2" | li
|-
| it
|}

There is a distinction in third person singular between animate&lt;!-- or is it something living? would that include flowers? --&gt; and inanimate: ''ta'' is used for humans and animals (corresponding to he/him, she/her, and it when used about an animal), and ''it'' about things and objects. If the speaker wishes to distinguish gender, there is also third person singular '''ela''' (she, her) and '''lu''' (he, him).

Just as in English, second person plural (you, you all) and singular (you) are both the same word: ''yu''. Lidepla also has an indefinite personal pronoun: '''oni''' (one, they as in “they say that...”, and “one does not...”).

==== Possessive forms ====
The short form of the possessive pronouns looks like this:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
! person
! singular
! plural
|-
! 1
| may
| nuy
|-
! 2
| yur
| yur
|-
! 3
| suy
| ley
|-
|}

The third person singular ''suy'' is universal and can be used as the possessive form for both ''ta'', ''it'', ''ela'' and ''lu'' – for ''ela''  and ''lu'' there's also the forms '''elay''' and '''luy'''.

The suffix ''-ney'' is used to form adjectives from nouns.&lt;ref&gt;''-ney'' is also used to form passive/past active participe&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is also possible to form longer possessive pronouns with the base form and the suffix ''-ney'': '''mi-ney''', '''yu-ney''', etc.

=== Verbs ===
Verb roots never change in Lidepla. Tense are formed by particles, or by suffixes.

== Vocabulary ==
{{wiktionary|Appendix:Lingwa de Planeta Swadesh list}}

Most Lidepla [[vocabulary]] is made up of [[international words]] of [[Latin]] origin. The most frequent words, though, are of English, Russian, Chinese, Arabic and Hindi origin. There are not definite endings for different [[parts of speech]], so nearly any word can be easily incorporated. The words are adapted to Lidepla [[phonology]] and don't preserve original [[orthography]] – the pronunciation is preserved in first hand, not the spelling.&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/lingwadeplaneta/conversations/topics/999 Yahoo discussion group]: “ ... While borrowing a word, we usually save its pronunciation, not spelling...”&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, the Lidepla vocabulary had about 4,000 entries, meaning about 10,000 individual words, with an increasing number. For a word to be incorporated, the following principles are taken into account:&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt;
* short words without consonant clusters are preferred
* the word has to be widespread and/or phonetically familiar for speakers of at least a few different [[national languages]]. For example, the word ''darba'' (strike),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lingwadeplaneta.info/en/svodka.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; of Arabic origin, is close to Russian “удар” ([udar]) and Chinese “da”.

=== Similarity examples ===
Whole Lidepla phrases sometimes sound very close to national languages ones,&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lingwadeplaneta" /&gt; with the same meaning:
* ''Brata snova dumi om to'' is similar to its equivalent in Russian (The brother is thinking about it again)
* ''Ta bu yao shwo'' to Chinese ''Tā bù yào shuō'' (He doesn't want to talk)
* ''Way yu go bak?'' to English ''Why do you go back?'' or ''Why are you going back?''
* ''Me jan ke mata pri pi chay'' to Hindi (I know that mother likes to drink tea), and
* ''Pa sabah me safari'' is similar to Arabic (In the morning I travel)

== Phonology ==
There are 17 basic [[consonants]] (b, d, g; p, t, k; w, f; s, ʃ; x; d͡ʒ, d͡z; m, n, r, l) and 3 optional ones (v; t͡ʃ; ŋ) in Lidepla.&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt;

Distinction of the sounds w — v, d͡ʒ — t͡ʃ is not obligatory, that is they may be pronounced in the same way, as there are no [[minimal pairs]] for them. The ŋ sound is the same as in English (in -ing ending).

== Development and use ==
The project is led by the psychologist Dmitri Ivanov. He laid the foundation of the language, using mainly the ideas of [[Otto Jespersen]] on the [[Novial]] language, and also the facts of [[Creole language]] development and structure, while linguists A. Vinogradova and E. Ivanova helped a lot during the early period of development. In 2007 A. Lysenko joined and became the main linguist of the project.&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt;

From the very beginning the project was open and widely discussed in a number of [[conlanger]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/auxlang/conversations/messages for example]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, more than 15 people contributed to the language considerably (that is, worked on vocabulary and grammar, translated and wrote original texts, including songs),&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt; not speaking about those who participated in discussions.

The basic version of the language was published on June 1, 2010.&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt; In some sources &lt;ref&gt;for example, {{cite book|author=Libert, Alan Reed / Moskovsky, Christo |chapter= |chapter-url= |format= |url=http://www.peterlang.com/download/datasheet/56178/datasheet_59678.pdf |title=Aspects of the Grammar and Lexica of Artificial Languages |location=Frankfurt am Main, Berlin, Bern, Bruxelles, New York, Oxford, Wien |year=2011 |page=180 |isbn=978-3-631-59678-4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924072046/http://www.peterlang.com/download/datasheet/56178/datasheet_59678.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the date of creation of Lidepla is stated to be 2006. It is thus important to clarify that the “basic version” of the language – that is, the version after which the basics of the language is not to be changed – wasn't published until 2010.&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt;

At the moment the language is used mainly on the Internet, when it comes to direct communication. About 10–15 people have mastered the language, and about 50 can use it in communication.&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt; A lot of texts have been translated, including rather spacious texts like ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = L. Carroll | title = Alisa-ney Aventura in Divalanda | orig-year = Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland | edition = 1| location = Cnoc Sceichín, Leac an Anfa, Cathair na Mart, Co. Mhaigh Eo, Éire| year = 2014 | publisher = Evertype | pages = 150 | isbn = 978-1-78201-071-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Sailor Ruterford in Maori captivity'' by [[:ru:Николай Чуковский|Nikolay Chukovsky]] (son of [[Korney Chukovsky]]; translated from Russian),&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt; and also some tales. There are songs both written and translated, including an album by musician [[:eo:Jonny M|Jonny M]],&lt;!-- (article in Esperanto Wikipedia) --&gt; and subtitles made for cartoons and movies (like the popular Russian film ''[[Ivan Vasilievich: Back to the Future]]'').&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt;

== Sample text ==
Pater Noster, [[the Lord's Prayer]], in Lingwa de Planeta:

:''Nuy Patra kel es pa swarga,''
:''hay Yur nam fa-sante,''
:''hay Yur reging lai,''
:''hay yur vola fulfil''
:''i pa arda i pa swarga.''

:''Dai ba a nu nuy pan fo jivi sedey''
:''e pardoni ba a nu nuy deba,''
:''kom nu pardoni toy-las kel debi a nu.''
:''Bye dukti nu inu temta''
:''e protekti nu fon bada.''

'''Maraimalai Adigal''' (15 July 1876 – 15 September 1950) was a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] orator and writer who fervently followed [[Saivism|Saivam]]. He wrote more than 100 books, including works on original poems and dramas, but most famous are his books on his research into [[Tamil literature]]. Most of his literary works were on Saivism. He founded a Saivite institution called ''Podhunilaik Kazhagam''. He was an exponent of the [[Pure Tamil movement]] and hence considered to be the father of Tamil [[linguistic purism]]. He advocated the use of Tamil devoid of [[Sanskrit]] words and hence changed his birth name ''Vedhachalam'' to ''Maraimalai''.

Politically he was inclined towards non-[[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahminism]] and hence he and his followers considered that the [[Self-respect movement]] was born out of his efforts.Though he is scholer of Tamil he has good scholestic study over Sanskrit as well as English Nevertheless, the [[atheist]], anti-Hindu ideologies of [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]] were shunned by Maraimalai Adigal and caused years of differences between the two. Maraimalai Adigal spent most of his income on buying his books and after his death his collection were made into a library according to his will.

==Early life==
Maraimalai Adigal was born on 15 July 1876{{cn|date=August 2017}} to Cokkanata Pillai and Cinnammai.&lt;ref name=companion213&gt;Zvelebil, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; His birth name was Vedhachalam. He did his early schooling at Wesley Mission High School in [[Nagappattinam]], but had to abandon his formal education with Fourth Form after his father's death.&lt;ref name=EIL82&gt;Encyclopaedia of Indian literature, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

=== English and Sanskrit learning ===
His stint as a student in Wesley Mission High School Nagapattiam made him proficient in English and Sanskrit.

==Education in Tamil literature==
Maraimalai Adigal in spite of discontinuing his formal education after 9th grade, continued learning Tamil from the Tamil scholar [[M. P. Narayana Pillai|Narayana Pillai]], who was making his livelihood by selling Tamil palm-leaf manuscripts.&lt;ref name=EIL82/&gt; He learnt Sanskrit and [[English language|English]] through his own effort.&lt;ref name=companion213/&gt; He later authored several articles in Tamil monthly called ''Neelalochani''. He later studied Saiva [[philosophy]] under [[Somasundara Naicker]]. With the help of [[Sundaram Pillai]], author of ''[[Manonmaniam]]'', he learned Tamil poetic dramas and thus acquired employment as a Tamil teacher in a school in [[Trivandrum]].&lt;ref name=EIL82/&gt;

==Career==
At the age of seventeen, he got married to Soundaravalli and soon after his marriage, he moved to [[Madras]] to work as a sub-editor to a journal ''Siddantha Deepikai''. Later, in March 1898, he quit this job to work with [[Parithimar Kalaignar|V. G. Suryanarana Sastri]] as a teacher in [[Madras Christian College]]. In his time in Madras Christian College he toured throughout [[Tamil Nadu]] giving lectures on Saivam.&lt;ref name=EIL82/&gt; At about the same time he started a society for Saivam called ''Saiva Siddhanta Maha Samajam''.&lt;ref name=TN&gt;[http://www.tamilnation.co/hundredtamils/maraimalai.htm One Hundred Tamils of the 20th century] on TamilNation.com&lt;/ref&gt; As a young teacher he was popular with his students who would visit his house to listen to his lectures.&lt;ref name=companion213/&gt;

In 1910 a decision was made by the Madras University to make the vernacular Tamil language optional for graduation in Arts subjects, leaving  English as a medium of education.  This decision caused many Tamil teachers to lose their jobs. Realising the vast knowledge and his great capacity as a teacher, Miller, the then Head of Christian College Madras, and other friends insisted that Adigal be given a job in the college. As the opportunity to teach Tamil was considerably reduced and few students opted to study it, the need for a full-time teacher was not a required. Adigal refused the offer and resigned to lead an ascetic life in a serene atmosphere outside the city and to study and do research in Tamil.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Works in Tamil literature==
Apart from being a good orator, Adigal composed several Tamil poems.&lt;ref name=EIL82/&gt; He authored more than 100 books. Other than essays and novels he wrote books dealing with literary criticism, philosophy and religion, history, psychology and politics.&lt;ref name=companion214&gt;Zvelebil, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; His collections of poems to the Hindu god [[Murugan|Sri Murugan]], which he composed during the times of illness were published as ''Thiruvotri Muruhar Mummanikkovai'' in 1900. He also wrote poems from recollections of his teacher Somasundara Naiker in 1901 as ''Somasundarak Kaanjiaakkam''. This has been considered as one of his best works. He also released his research work on Tamil literature ''Mullaip Pattu Aaraichi'' for students of Tamil literature.&lt;ref name=EIL82/&gt; He translated [[Kalidasa]]'s '[[Abhijñānaśākuntalam]]' into Tamil as ''Sakuntalai''.&lt;ref name=TN/&gt;

Some of his prominent works include:&lt;ref name=companion214/&gt;
*''Pattinapalaai Aaraaichi-yurai'' (1906)
*''Tamizhthaai'' (1933)
*''Sinthanaikatturaikal'' (1908)
*''Arivuraikkothu'' (1921)
*''Chiruvarkaana Senthamizh'' (1934)
*''Ilainarkaana Inramizh'' (1957 – posthumous  publication)
*''Arivuraikkovai'' (1971 – posthumous  publication)
*''Maraimalaiyatikal paamanaikkovai'' (1977 – posthumous  publication)

In 1911, he published his first novel, ''Kumuthavalli allathu Naahanaattarasi'', an adaptation of English novel ''Leela'' by [[G. W. M. Reynolds]].&lt;ref name=companion214/&gt;

He also wrote books on the subjects of self-improvement, self-help and personality development. These included ''Maranathin pin Manithar Nilai'' (Human Life stage After Death), ''Mesmerism and Hypnotism'' and ''Tholaivil unarthal'' (Telepathy).

==As Swami Vedhachalam==

After quitting his teaching job on 10 April 1911, Adigal moved to Pallavaram, a suburb of Madras. There he began to dress as a ''[[Sanyasin]]'' from 27 August 1911 and became known as ''Swami Vedhachalam''. He became a devout follower of [[Saivism|Saivam]] and started an institution named ''Podhunilaik Kazhagam''. The motto of the institution was set at ''Ondre Kulam, Oruvanae Devan'' (Mankind is one, and God is one). The Kazhagam made efforts to make people of all castes, creeds and religions to worship Sri Siva together. 
He started the Thiru Murugan Press (TM Press) in his residence at Pallavaram and published a number of books and magazines. He also started a monthly called ''Gnaana Saaharam'' (Ocean of Wisdom).&lt;ref name=EIL82/&gt;

==Pure Tamil movement Tanittamil Iyakkam==
{{main|Pure Tamil movement}}
In the year 1916 he became an expert of pure Tamil movement advocating the use of Tamil language devoid of loan words from Sanskrit. Thus he changed the name of ''Gnaana Saaharam'' to ''Arivukkadal'' and his title of Swami Vedhachalam to ''Maraimalai Adigal'' (where Adigal is Tamil for Swami).&lt;ref name=EIL83&gt;Encyclopaedia of Indian literature, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Thus he is referred to as the "Father of Tamil Puritanism".&lt;ref name=EIL83/&gt;&lt;ref name=ENI92&gt;{{cite book

==Maraimalai Adigal and Self-respect movement==
{{Dravidian politics-col}}

===Non-Brahminism===
Apart being the called as father of pure Tamil movement, Maraimalai Adigal is also considered as father of Non-Brahmin Tamil movements.&lt;ref name=Ravi/&gt; Maraimalai Adigal himself claimed that the non-Brahmin stance of [[Self-respect movement]] was born out of his views and principles.&lt;ref name=coffee117&gt;Vēṅkaṭācalapati, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the [[atheist]] stance of [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]], who was heading the Self-respect movement, was observed by Maraimalai Adigal and his followers as counter productive.&lt;ref name=coffee116/&gt; On this issue, Ilavalaganar, a student of Maraimalai Adigal wrote: {{cquote|[[Saivism]] is not one iota different from the primary aim of the [[Self-respect movement]]. The Self-respect movement arose to dispel the illusion of [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] from the [[Tamil people]] and infuse self-respect into them. Saivism also does the same. The Self-respect Movement detests the Aryan [[Brahmins]]. Saivism too doesn't like the Aryan Brahmins one bit... The Self-respect movement wishes to uplift the depressed classes. That is also the basic idea of Saivism.... The Self-respect movement is against caste differences among the Tamil people. Saivism too emphasizes the same point... when there are so many commonalities, why should Saivism and Saivite apostles be deprecated and condemned [by the Self-respect movement].&lt;ref name=coffee116&gt;Vēṅkaṭācalapati, pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Differences with Self-respect movement===
Although initially a supporter of the Self-respect movement, which he saw as a non-Brahmin movement, he vehemently opposed the atheistic views of its leadership. At one stage he asked Ulaganatha Mudaliar, brother of [[V. Kalyanasundaram|Thiru. Vi. Kaliyanasundara Mudaliar]] (Thiru Vi. Ka as he was popularly known) and an eminent Saivite scholar himself, to arrange for a statewide tour to counter the propaganda of the Self-respect movement.&lt;ref name=coffee118&gt;Vēṅkaṭācalapati, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Maraimalai Adigal looked upon the Self-respect movement as a handiwork of the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] [[Vaishnavites]]. On this Maraimalai Adigal wrote {{cquote|The leader of the [[Self-respect movement]] is a Vaishnavite; his brother too, we come to understand, is a Vaishnavite who has converted many gullible Saivites to Vaishnavism. Their accomplices too are Vaishnavites. Some of the Justice Party leaders too are Vaishnavites. Moreover, not only are they Vaishnavites, they are also [[Telugu language|Telugu]]-speakers.&lt;ref name=coffee118/&gt;}}

Kalyanasundara Mudaliar, although a Saivite himself, disagreed with Maraimalai Adigal. Kalyanasundaram refused to publish Maraimalai Adigal's essay against Self-respect movement in his journal.&lt;ref name=coffee118/&gt; The antipathy between Maraimalai Adigal and the members of Self-respect movement was also explicit with ''Kudiarasu'', the political organ of Self-respect movement claiming that Maraimalai Adigal was calling for Periyar to be murdered.&lt;ref name=coffee119&gt;Vēṅkaṭācalapati, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconciliation===
Eventually after years of disagreement, both Maraimalai Adigal and Periyar realised that the disagreement is harmful for their interest and worked towards a rapproachement.&lt;ref name=coffee120&gt;Vēṅkaṭācalapati, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Periyar offered an unconditional apology to Maraimalai Adigal and in reply,  Maraimalai Adigal wrote a series on the ''[[Ramayana]]'' in Periyar's [[English language]] weekly ''Revolt''.&lt;ref name=coffee121&gt;Vēṅkaṭācalapati, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Although the apology and reconciliation were at a personal level between Periyar and Maraimalai Adigal, the difference in ideologies still made their followers to cross swords.&lt;ref name=coffee121/&gt;

==Maraimalai Adigal Library==
Maraimalai Adigal spent most of his income on buying books.&lt;ref name=EIL83/&gt; Research on the readership of his book collections show that between 20 April 1923 to 10 August 1930 a total of 1852 people had borrowed his books.&lt;ref name=EIL83/&gt; The readership included people from [[Madras Presidency]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Burma]] and [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref name=EIL83/&gt; Upon his death, on 15 September 1950,&lt;ref name=TN/&gt; according to his will, the books were left for the people of Tamil Nadu and thus a library named after him was started in 1958 by the then MD, Padmashri V.Subbiah Pillai of [[South India Saiva Siddhanta Works Publishing Society Ltd.]] at Linghi Street, [[Chennai]]. by adding more no of rare collection of Tamil books&lt;ref name=EIL83/&gt; The library was a repertoire of books and journals, some printed way back in 1779. In May 2008, the Tamil Nadu Government helped by allocating a space at [[Connemara Public Library]] but the library management is still with the present MD [[Rajagopal Muthukumaraswamy]] of South India Saiva Siddhanta Works Publishing Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''minimum detectable signal''' is a signal at the input of a system whose power produces a [[signal-to-noise ratio]] of '''m''' at the output. In practice, '''m''' is usually chosen to be greater than unity. In some literature, the name ''sensitivity'' is used for this concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5952-8255E.pdf|title=Fundamentals of RF and Microwave Noise Figure Measurements|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Keysight Technologies|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|ref=Application Note 57-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==

In general it is clear that for a receiver to "see" a signal it has to be greater than the noise floor. To actually detect the signal however, it is often required to be at a power level greater than the noise floor by an amount that is dependent on the type of detection used as well as other factors. There are exceptions to this requirement but coverage of these cases is outside the scope of this article. This required difference in power levels of the signal and the noise floor is known as the signal to noise ratio ([[Signal-to-noise ratio|SNR]]). To establish the minimum detectable signal (MDS) of a receiver we require several factors to be known.

* Required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in dB
* Detection bandwidth (BW) in Hz
* Temperature of the receiver system ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in [[kelvin]]s
* [[Boltzmann's constant]] ''k'' = 1.38{{e|-23}} [[joules]] per [[kelvin]]
* Receiver noise figure (NF) in dB

To calculate the minimum detectable signal we first need to establish the noise floor in the receiver by the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;
\text{Noise floor}_\text{dBm} = 10 \log_{10} (k \times T_0 \times 1000) + \text{NF} + 10\log_{10}\text{BW}.
&lt;/math&gt;

As a numerical example:

A receiver has a bandwidth of 100&amp;nbsp;MHz and noise figure of 1.5&amp;nbsp;dB and the physical temperature of the system is 290 [[kelvin]]s.

                   Noise floor (dBm) = 10 log(1.38{{e|-23}} × 290 x 1{{e|3}}) + 1.5 + 10 log(100{{e|6}})
                    = −174 + 1.5 + 80 (dBm)
                    = −92.5 (dBm)

So for this receiver to even begin to "see" a signal it would need to be greater than −92.5 [[dBm]]. Confusion can arise because the level calculated above is also sometimes called the Minimum Discernable Signal (MDS). For the sake of clarity we will refer to this as the noise floor of the receiver. The next step is to take into account the [[Signal-to-noise ratio|SNR]] required for the type of detection we are using. If we need the signal to be 10 times more powerful than the noise floor the required SNR would be 10&amp;nbsp;dB. To calculate the actual minimum detectable signal is simply a case of adding the required SNR in dB to the noise floor. So for the example above this would mean that the minimum detectable signal is:

MDS ([[dBm]]) = -92.5 + 10 = -82.5 ([[dBm]])

MDS ([[dBm]]) = 10Log(kTo*1e3) + NF + 10Log(BW) + [[Signal-to-noise ratio|SNR]] ([[Decibel|dB]])

In this equation:

''kT''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the available noise power in a bandwidth BW = 1&amp;nbsp;Hz at ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, expressed in [[watt]]s. 
''kT''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; x 1000 is the available noise power in a bandwidth BW = 1&amp;nbsp;Hz at ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, expressed in [[milliwatts]]. ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the system temperature in [[kelvin]]s, and '''k''' is [[Boltzmann's constant]] (1.38×10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; [[joule]]s per [[kelvin]] = −228 dBW/(K·Hz)).  If the system temperature and bandwidth is 290 K and 1&amp;nbsp;Hz, then the effective noise power available in 1&amp;nbsp;Hz bandwidth from a source is −174 dBm (174&amp;nbsp;dB below the one milliwatt level taken as a reference).

1&amp;nbsp;Hz noise floor: calculating the noise power available in a one hertz bandwidth at a temperature of ''T''&amp;nbsp;= 290 K defines a figure from which all other values can be obtained (different bandwidths, temperatures).  1&amp;nbsp;Hz noise floor equates to a noise power of −174 dBm so a 1&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth would generate −174 + 10&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(1&amp;nbsp;kHz) = −144dBm of noise power (the noise is thermal noise, [[Johnson noise]]).

MDS ([[dBm]]) = 10Log(kTo*1e3) + NF + 10Log(BW) + [[Signal-to-noise ratio|SNR]] ([[dBm]])

The equation above indicates several ways in which the minimum detectable signal of a receiver can be improved. If one assumes that the bandwidth and SNR are fixed however by the application, then one way of improving MDS is by lowering the receivers physical temperature. This lowers the NF of the receiver by reducing  the internal thermally produced noise. These type of receivers are referred to as [[Cryogenic Receivers]].

==Definitions==

===Noise figure and noise factor===
[[Noise figure]] (''NF'') is [[noise factor]] (''F'') expressed in decibels. ''F'' is the ratio of the input [[signal-to-noise-ratio]] (SNR&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) to the output signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;). ''F'' quantifies how much the signal degrades with respect to the noise because of the presence of a noisy network.  A noiseless amplifier has a noise factor ''F''=1, so the noise figure for that amplifier is ''NF''=0&amp;nbsp;dB: a noiseless amplifier does not degrade the signal to noise ratio as both signal and noise propagate through the network.

If the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] in which the information signal is measured turns out not to be 1&amp;nbsp;Hz wide, then the term 10&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(bandwidth) allows for the additional noise power present in the wider detection bandwidth.

===Signal-to-noise-ratio===
[[Signal-to-noise-ratio]] (SNR) is the degree to which the input signal power is greater than the noise power within the bandwidth B of interest. In the case of some digital systems a 10&amp;nbsp;dB difference between the noise floor and the signal level might be necessary; this 10&amp;nbsp;dB SNR allows a bit error rate (BER) to be better than some specified figure (e.g. 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; for some QPSK schemes).  For voice signals the required SNR might be as low as 6&amp;nbsp;dB and for CW ([[Morse_code|Morse]]) it might extend, with a trained listener, down to 1&amp;nbsp;dB difference ([[tangential sensitivity]]). Usable in this context then means it conveys adequate information for decoding by a person or a machine with acceptable and defined levels of error.

The '''Mossi language''' (known in the language as '''Mooré'''; also ''Mòoré, Mõõré, Moré, Moshi, Moore, More'') is a [[Gur language]] of the [[Oti–Volta]] branch and one of two official [[regional language]]s of [[Burkina Faso]], closely related to the [[Frafra language]] spoken just across the border in the northern half of [[Ghana]] and less-closely to [[Dagbani language|Dagbani]] and [[Mampruli language|Mampruli]] further south. It is the language of the [[Mossi people]], spoken by approximately 5 million people in [[Burkina Faso]], plus another 60,000+ in [[Mali]] and [[Togo]].

== Phonology ==

The Mossi language consists of the following sounds:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kabore (1985) : (p.44) for the consonants, (p.85-86) for the vowels.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consonants===

* All vowels (oral and nasal) are pronounced like their lengthened counterparts.
* Other linguists include the vowels {{IPAslink|ɛ}} and {{IPAslink|ɔ}}; here, they are analysed as diphthongs, ({{IPAslink|ɛ}} is considered to be ea and {{IPAslink|ɔ}} is considered to be oa).

== Orthography ==
In [[Burkina Faso]], the Mossi alphabet uses the letters specified in the national [[Burkinabé alphabet]].

The [[Naxi language]] of southwestern [[China]] may be written in the syllabic [[geba syllabary|''geba'' script]]. There is also a Naxi tradition of pictographic symbols called [[Dongba symbols|''dongba'']]; this may sometimes be [[Interlinear gloss|gloss]]ed with ''geba'' for clarification, since a ''dongba'' text may be intelligible only to its author. 

A [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] was developed for Naxi in the 20th century.

'''Nǁng''' or '''Nǁŋǃke''', commonly known by its primary dialect '''Nǀuu''' (Nǀhuki), is a [[moribund language|moribund]] [[Tuu languages|Tuu (Khoisan) language]] once spoken in South Africa. It is no longer spoken on a daily basis, as the speakers live in different villages. The dialect name ǂKhomani is used for the entire people by the South African government, but the descendents of ǂKhomani-dialect speakers now speak [[Khoikhoi language|Khoikhoi]]. As of January 2013, only three speakers of the Nǀuu dialect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39935150 |title=Trying to save South Africa's first language |author=Pumza Fihlani |publisher=[[BBC News]], Northern Cape |date=30 August 2017 |access-date=11 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and two of the ǁ’Au dialect remain.

==Classification and name==
Nǁng belongs to the [[Tuu languages|Tuu]] (Taa–ǃKwi) language family, with extinct [[ǀXam language|ǀXam]] being its closest relative and [[Taa language|Taa]] its closest living relative.

The two recent dialects are Nǀuu (Nǀhuki) and ǁ’Au (ǁKh’au). Extinct dialects include ǂKhomani and Langeberg. ǂKhomani had been recorded by Doke and by Maingard, Nǀhuki by Weshphal, and Langeberg by Dorothea Bleek.&lt;ref&gt;Güldemann (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, most remaining speakers spoke Nǀuu dialect, and this was the name Nǁng appeared under when it was rediscovered. However, two spoke ǁ’Au and rejected the label Nǀuu.

Of the names Nǀuu, ǁ’Au, and Nǁng, the easiest for English speakers to pronounce is Nǀuu. The vertical bar (in some fonts: a slash) symbol represents a [[dental click]] like the English interjection ''tsk! tsk! (tut! tut!)'' used to express pity or shame; "Nǀuu" is pronounced like ''noo'', with a ''tsk!'' pronounced in the middle of the {{IPA|[n]}}. The double-vertical-bar in "Nǁng" is a (single) [[lateral click]], pronounced like the ''tchick!'' used to spur on a horse; the name is pronounced like the ''ng'' of ''sung'' with this click in it.

The word ''nǀuu'' {{IPA|/ᵑǀùú/}} is actually a verb, 'to speak Nǀuu'.  The people call themselves ''Nǁ-ǂe'' {{IPA|/ᵑǁŋ̀ŋ̀ ǂé/}} 'people', and Westphal believes this may be the term recorded by Bleek and variously rendered in the literature as ''ǁNg ǃ’e, ǁn-ǃke, ǁŋ.ǃke''.&lt;ref&gt;Distinguish ''Nǀhuǁéi'', which is a variety of [[Taa language|Taa]], and ''ǁŨǁ’e,'' which is related to [[Seroa language|Seroa]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Nǀusan is an ambiguous Khoekhoe exonym, and is used for several Tuu languages.  Traill says that the [[/'Auni language|ǀ’Auni]] call their language ''Nǀhuki,'' but others have recorded their name for their language as ''ǀ’Auo,'' and both Westphal and Köhler state that ''Nǀhuki (Nǀhuci, nǀɦuki)'' is a variety of Nǁng.  It's not clear if both are correct or if languages have gotten mixed up in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Yvonne Treis, 1998, "Names of Khoisan Languages and their Variants"&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Nǁng prospered through the 19th century, but encroaching non-ǃKwi languages and [[acculturation]] threatened it, like most other Khoisan languages. The language was mainly displaced by [[Afrikaans]] and [[Nama language|Nama]], especially after speakers started migrating to towns in the 1930s and found themselves surrounded by non-Nǁng-speaking people. In 1973 their language was declared extinct, and the remaining Nǁnǂe ("ǂKhomani") were evicted from the [[Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park|Kalahari Gemsbok National Park]].

In the 1990s, linguists located 101-year-old [[Elsie Vaalbooi]], who could still speak Nǁng. [[Anthony Traill (linguist)|Anthony Traill]] interviewed her in 1997. The [[South African San Institute]] soon became involved in the pursuit of information on the Nǁng language, and with the help of Vaalbooi they tracked down 25 other people scattered by the eviction who were able to speak or at least understand the language. [[Thabo Mbeki]] handed over 400&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of land to the Nǁnǂe in 1999, and 250&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of land within the park in 2002. Vaalbooi came up with the Nǁng motto of ''Sa ǁ’a ǃainsi uinsi'' (also written ''Sa //a !aĩsi 'uĩsi)'' "We move towards a better life" for her rehabilitated people. This was also adopted as the official motto for the [[Northern Cape Province]]. At the time there were twenty elderly speakers, eight of whom lived in the [[Western Cape]] province signed over to them. As of 2007, fewer than ten are still alive in South Africa, and a few more in Botswana; none live with another speaker, and their daily languages are [[Khoekhoe language|Khoekhoe]] and [[Tswana language|Tswana]], respectively. The younger generations of ǂKhomani are proud Nama speakers, and have little affinity to Nǁng, so there is little chance of saving the language. Linguist [[Nigel Crawhall]] is heading a team to document what remains.

Recent research on Nǁng led by [[Amanda Miller (linguist)|Amanda Miller]] of [[Cornell University]] has helped describe the physics of its [[click consonant|clicks]], leading to a [[Click consonants#The airstream|better understanding of click sounds]] in general.&lt;ref name="nsf"&gt;{{cite web

Efforts to perpetuate the N|uu language continue in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trying to save South Africa's first language |date=30 August 2017 |journal=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-39935150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speech sounds==
Nǁng has one of the more complex sound inventories of the world's languages. Most [[lexical word]]s consist of a [[phonological foot]] with two [[Mora (linguistics)|moras]] ([[tone (linguistics)|tone]]-bearing units). The first mora must start with a consonant (CV). The second mora may be a single vowel (V), a nasal consonant ''m'' or ''n'' (N), or one of a drastically reduced number of consonants plus a vowel (cV). That is, lexical roots, not counting sometimes lexicalized CV prefixes and suffixes, are typically CVcV, CVV, CVN, though there are also a few which are CV, as well as longer words of two phonological feet: CVCV, where the second C is not one of the reduced set of consonants but cannot be a click,&lt;ref&gt;The most common consonants in this position are glottal stop, /c/, and /k/.&lt;/ref&gt; CVCVN, CVVCV, CVNCV, CVVCVN, CVNCVN, CVcVCV, CVVCVcV. [[Grammatical word]]s tend to be CV or V.&lt;ref&gt;Mats Exter, 2008 [2012], ''Properties of the Anterior and Posterior Click Closures in N|uu'', disertation, University of Cologne&lt;/ref&gt;

There are occasional exceptions to these patterns in ideophonic words such as {{IPA|/ɟùɾùkúɟúí-sí/}} 'Namaqua sandgrouse' (CVcVCVCVV + suffix) and historically reduplicated words with clicks such as {{IPA|/ǁáḿǁàm̀/}} 'to talk'.

===Vowels===
Like most languages in southern Africa, Nǁng has five vowel qualities. These may occur [[strident vowel|strident]] and [[nasal vowel|nasalized]]. A word may have two adjacent vowels, which resemble a long vowel or diphthong.

The strident vowels are thought to have the phonation called [[harsh voice]]. They are strongly pharyngealized, and for some speakers involve low-frequency trilling that presumably involves the [[aryepiglottic fold]]. The four strident vowel qualities (there is no strident ''i'') are rather different from the non-strident vowels, as is common when a vowel is [[pharyngealized]].

|}

Nǁng is the only Khoisan language known to have a strident front vowel, {{IPA|/eˁ/}}, though this is rare, occurring in only two known words, {{IPA|/zḛ̰́é/}} 'to fly' and {{IPA|/ᵑ̊ǂḛ̰̀βé/}} 'loincloth'. The lack of a nasalized equivalent is thought to be an [[accidental gap]] or simply unattested due to the small number of known words.

The tone-bearing segment may be a syllabic nasal, {{IPA|/ŋ̍/}}, rather than a vowel, as in the name Nǁng.

Only certain sequences of vowels may occur in a bimoraic foot, regardless of whether there is an intervening consonant. (That is, the permitted vowels are the same whether a word is CVcV or CVV.) If the first vowel is any variety (nasal, strident, etc.) of {{IPA|/i, e, ŋ̍/}}, then the second vowel must be identical. If the first vowel is {{IPA|/a/}}, then the second may be anything but {{IPA|/ŋ̍/}}. If the first vowel is {{IPA|/o/}} or {{IPA|/u/}}, then the second may be either {{IPA|/a/}} or a vowel of the same [[vowel height|height]]: that is, ''oa, oo, oe; ua, uu, ui''. The vowels must be both oral or both nasal; nasal vowels cannot follow a [[nasal stop]] (though they may follow [[nasal click]]s). Only the first vowel may be strident.

Front vowels can only follow the click types {{IPA|ǀ}} and {{IPA|ǂ}} (the [[back-vowel constraint]]), with a single known exception, {{IPA|ᵑǁˀé}} 'to go'. Front vowels and strident vowels may also not follow {{IPA|[χ]}}, whether an affricate release or a fricative, with the exception of three female kin terms where the second syllable is {{IPA|/χè/}}. As with the lack of strident front vowels, there are thus a small number of exceptions for these constraints with {{IPA|/e/}}, but none with {{IPA|/i/}}.

===Tones===
Nǁng moras may carry a high or low [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], /H/ or /L/. A typical lexical word consists of two moras, and so may have a high (HH), low (LL), rising (LH), or falling (HL) tone.

Monomoraic lexical roots, such as {{IPA|/cú/}} 'mouth', are high- rather than low-tone by a 5–1 margin. CVV and CVN roots are HH, HL, and LH with about equal frequency, with LL slightly less common. However, half of all CVcV roots are LH, making it markedly frequent, while only 5% are HL. In an additional CV foot the distribution of H and L is approximately equal; an additional CVN or CVcV foot may pattern like an initial foot, but they are too infrequent to be sure.

===Consonants===
The majority of Nǁng consonants are [[click consonant|clicks]]. It was once thought that Khoisan languages distinguish [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[uvular consonant|uvular]] clicks, but recent research into Nǁng, and reevaluation of the data on [[ǃXóõ language|ǃXóõ]], indicates that, for these languages at least, the distinction is one of pure clicks versus click–plosive [[contour (linguistics)|contour]]s.

"(?)" marks possible accidental gaps; these consonants might be expected based on their occurrence in neighboring languages with similar phonologies, but are expected to be rare, and may occur in Nǁng words that have not been recorded.

What were historically initial alveolar occlusives have become pre-palatal in lexical words. Among grammatical words in Nǀuu dialect there is a single exception, ''ná'' 'I'; in ǁ’Au dialect even that has merged, for ''ɲá'' 'I'.

These are simple clicks. The traditional term "velaric" is something of a misnomer, for the rear articulation is further back than the velum, and indeed further back than Nǁng {{IPA|/q/}}. Miller et al. prefer the term "lingual" for this [[airstream mechanism]]; they also reject the existence of click "accompaniments", using the IPA symbols to represent both points of articulation rather than solely the anterior articulation. Besides being motivated phonetically, this has the benefit of better illustrating the parallels between clicks and pulmonic consonants.

In the above rubric, the first element of the name is the forward articulation, and the second is the rear articulation.

These are [[contour (linguistics)|airstream contour consonants]], which start off with a lingual (velaric) airstream mechanism and finish with a pulmonic airstream (whereas affricates are manner contour consonants, starting as plosives and finishing as fricatives). Traditionally, these were considered to be uvular clicks, because the uvular or pharyngeal closure is audible, but in fact the rear closure of all Nǁng clicks is uvular or pharyngeal. (The distinction between uvular and pharyngeal is not represented here.) Effectively, in these clicks the release of the rear articulation is delayed, so that there is a double release burst, the forward (lingual) release followed by the rear (pulmonic) release.

These differ from the previous consonants in that the second, rear release is an ejective.

Wisdom and foresight in Chinese thought: sensing the immediate future. Journal of Futures Studies. 22(3), pp. 35-50. https://doi.org/10.6531/JFS.2018.22(3).00A35 &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Predictability and Causality==
 
[[Causal determinism]] has a strong relationship with predictability&lt;ref&gt;Vespignani, A., 2012. Modelling dynamical processes in complex socio-technical systems. Nature physics, 8(1), p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;. Perfect predictability implies strict determinism, but lack of predictability does not necessarily imply lack of determinism&lt;ref&gt;Simandan D. 2010. Beware of contingency. Environment and planning. D: Society and Space, 28(3), pp. 388-396. https://doi.org/10.1068/d2310 
&lt;/ref&gt;. Limitations on predictability could be caused by factors such as a lack of information or excessive complexity&lt;ref&gt;Vespignani, A., 2009. Predicting the behavior of techno-social systems. Science, 325(5939), pp.425-428.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
 
In experimental physics, there are always observational errors determining variables such as positions and velocities. So perfect prediction is ''practically'' impossible. Moreover, in modern [[quantum mechanics]], [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s [[indeterminacy principle]] puts limits on the accuracy with which such quantities can be known. So such perfect predictability is also ''theoretically'' impossible. &lt;!-- [To the author: please, take care that the indeterminacy principle defines the state of a particle to be indetermined until it is observed and, therefore, if it is not observed it cannot be measured. It has nothing to do with the accuracy of measurement.] --&gt;

=== Laplace's Demon ===
[[Laplace's Demon]] is a supreme intelligence who could completely predict the one possible future given the Newtonian dynamical laws of classical physics and perfect knowledge of the positions and velocities of all the particles in the world. In other words, if it were possible to have every piece of data on every atom in the universe from the beginning of time, it would be possible to predict the behavior of every atom into the future. Laplace’s determinism is usually thought to be based on his mechanics, but he could not prove mathematically that mechanics is deterministic. Rather, his determinism is based on general philosophical principles, specifically on the principle of sufficient reason and the law of continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Strien|first=Marij|date=2014-03-01|title=On the origins and foundations of Laplacian determinism|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039368113001325|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A|volume=45|issue=Supplement C|pages=24–31|doi=10.1016/j.shpsa.2013.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In statistical physics==
Although the [[second law of thermodynamics]] can determine the [[equilibrium state]] that a system will evolve to, and [[steady state]]s in [[dissipative system]]s can sometimes be predicted, there exists no general rule to predict the [[time evolution]] of systems distanced from equilibrium, e.g. [[chaotic system]]s, if they do not approach an equilibrium state.  Their predictability usually deteriorates with time and to quantify predictability, the rate of divergence of system [[trajectory|trajectories]] in [[phase space]] can be measured ([[Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy]], [[Lyapunov exponent]]s).&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Boeing, G.|title=Visual Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Chaos, Fractals, Self-Similarity and the Limits of Prediction|journal=Systems|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages=37|doi=10.3390/systems4040037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mathematics==
In [[stochastic analysis]] a [[stochastic process|random process]] is a [[predictable process]] if it is possible to know the next state from the present time.

The branch of mathematics known as [[Chaos theory|Chaos Theory]] focuses on the behavior of systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. It suggests that a small change in an initial condition can completely alter the progression of a system. This phenomenon is known as the [[butterfly effect]], which claims that a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a tornado in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Boeing (2015). [http://geoffboeing.com/2015/03/chaos-theory-logistic-map/ "Chaos Theory and the Logistic Map"]. Retrieved 2015-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of chaos theory suggests that the predictability of any system is limited because it is impossible to know all of the minutiae of a system at the present time. In principal, the deterministic systems that chaos theory attempts to analyze can be predicted, but uncertainty in a forecast increases exponentially with elapsed time.&lt;ref&gt; ''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order'', Steven Strogatz, Hyperion, New York, 2003, pages 189-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In human–computer interaction==
In the study of [[human–computer interaction]], predictability is the property to forecast the consequences of a user action given the current state of the system.

A contemporary example of human-computer interaction manifests in the development of computer vision algorithms for collision-avoidance software in self-driving cars. Researchers at NVIDIA Corporation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The AI Car Computer for Autonomous Driving|url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/drive-px.html|publisher=NVIDIA|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Princeton University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chen|first1=Chenyi|title=Deep Learning for Self -driving Car|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~alaink/Orf467F14/Deep%20Driving.pdf|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other institutions are leveraging deep learning to teach computers to anticipate subsequent road scenarios based on visual information about current and previous states.

Another example of human-computer interaction are computer simulations meant to predict human behavior based on algorithms. For example, MIT has recently developed an incredibly accurate algorithm to predict the behavior of humans. When tested against television shows, the algorithm was able to predict with great accuracy the subsequent actions of characters. Algorithms and computer simulations like these show great promise for the future of artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.mit.edu/2016/teaching-machines-to-predict-the-future-0621&lt;/ref&gt;

==In human sentence processing==
{{Main |Prediction in language comprehension}}
Linguistic prediction is a phenomenon in [[psycholinguistics]] occurring whenever information about a word or other linguistic unit is activated before that unit is actually encountered. Evidence from [[eyetracking]], [[event-related potentials]], and other experimental methods indicates that in addition to integrating each subsequent word into the context formed by previously encountered words, language users may, under certain conditions, try to predict upcoming words. Predictability has been shown to affect both text and speech processing, as well as speech production. Further, predictability has been shown to have an effect on syntactic, semantic and pragmatic comprehension.

==In biology==
In the study of biology – particularly [[genetics]] and [[neuroscience]] – predictability relates to the prediction of biological developments and behaviors based on inherited genes and past experiences.

Significant debate exists in the scientific community over whether or not a person's behavior is completely predictable based on their genetics. Studies such as the one in Israel, which showed that judges were more likely to give a lighter sentence if they had eaten more recently.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/04/11/justice-is-served-but-more-so-after-lunch-how-food-breaks-sway-the-decisions-of-judges/#.WcrXEq2ZP_Q&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to cases like this, it has been proven that individuals smell better to someone with complementary immunity genes, leading to more physical attraction.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/may/24/genes-human-attraction&lt;/ref&gt; Genetics can be examined to determine if an individual is predisposed to any diseases, and behavioral disorders can most often be explained by analyzing defects in genetic code. Scientist who focus on examples like these argue that human behavior is entirely predictable. Those on the other side of the debate argue that genetics can only provide a predisposition to act a certain way and that, ultimately, humans possess the free will to choose whether or not to act.

Animals have significantly more predictable behavior than humans. Driven by natural selection, animals develop mating calls, predator warnings, and communicative dances. One example of these engrained behaviors is the Belding's ground squirrel, which developed a specific set of calls that warn nearby squirrels about predators. If a ground squirrel sees a predator on land it will elicit a trill after it gets to safety, which signals to nearby squirrels that they should stand up on their hind legs and attempt to locate the predator. When a predator is seen in the air, a ground squirrel will immediately call out a long whistle, putting himself in danger but signaling for nearby squirrels to run for cover. Through experimentation and examination scientists have been able to chart behaviors like this and very accurately predict how animals behave in certain situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/BF00293209|title = Alarm calls of Belding's ground squirrels to aerial predators: Nepotism or self-preservation?|journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume = 17|issue = 4|pages = 313–323|year = 1985|last1 = Sherman|first1 = Paul W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The study of predictability often sparks debate between those who believe humans maintain complete control over their free-will and those who believe our actions are predetermined. However, it is likely that neither [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] nor [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] saw the study of predictability as relating to determinism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/predictability.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
One example of prediction techniques is tarot cards. Tarot cards have been used for hundreds of years to help in determining the future. "Fortune tellers" have been traced through history back to the Ancient Egyptians, however the earliest complete record dates only to the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/extrasensory-perceptions/tarot-card6.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Tasseography is a divination method, typically utilizing tea leaves or coffee grounds. Western tasseography first started in medieval Europe, where fortune tellers would interpret splatters of wax, lead, and various other molten substances. When the Dutch brought tea from China in the seventeenth century, this evolved into tea tasseography. Tasseography is typically performed in a bright colored cup to contrast with the dark tea leaves or coffee grounds. The bright colors symbolize good fortunes while the dark color symbolizes misfortunes.&lt;ref&gt;Guiley, Rosemary. "tasseomancy." The encyclopedia of witches, witchcraft, and wicca. 3rd ed. N.p.: Infobase Publishing, 2008. 341. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In climate==
As [[climate change]] and other weather phenomenon become more common, the predictability of climate systems becomes more important. The [[IPCC]] notes that our ability to predict future detailed climate interactions is difficult, however, long term climate forecasts are possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Predictability of the Climate System|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/265.htm|website=Working Group I: The Scientific Basis|publisher=IPCC|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Spring Predictability Barrier===
The Spring Predictability Barrier refers to a period of time early in the year when making summer weather predictions about the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]] is difficult. It is unknown why it is difficult, although many theories have been proposed. There is some thought that the cause is due to the [[ENSO]] transition where conditions are more rapidly shifting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=L'Heureux|first1=Michelle|title=The Spring Predictability Barrier: we'd rather be on Spring Break|url=https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/spring-predictability-barrier-we’d-rather-be-spring-break|website=Climate.gov|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In macroeconomics ==
Predictability in macroeconomics refers most frequently to the degree to which an economic model accurately reflects quarterly data and the degree to which one might successfully identify the internal propagation mechanisms of models. Examples of US macroeconomic series of interest include but are not limited to Consumption, Investment, Real GNP, and Capital Stock. Factors that are involved in the predictability of an economic system include the range of the forecast (is the forecast two years "out" or twenty) and the variability of estimates. Mathematical processes for assessing the predictability of macroeconomic trends are still in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diebold|first1=Francis X.|title= Measuring Predictability: Theory and Macroeconomic Applications|url=https://www.jstor.org.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/stable/pdf/2678520.pdf?refreqid=search%3Aedbefab250df2fc366425cd574f0d998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1156">'''Reism''' or '''concretism''' is a [[philosophical]] theory of [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], based on the [[ontology]] of [[Stanislaw Lesniewski]], specifically, his "calculus of names".

In ontological sense, reism was condensed by  Kotarbiński to the two postulates 
*"every object is a body", i.e., all abstract concepts are to be reduced to concrete objects.
* no object is a state or relation, or property.

In semantical sense, it is a theory of [[language]] which draws a distinction between "real" names, i.e., names associated with bodies and pseudo-names, '''onomatoids''', which denote states, relations, properties, events, etc. It further elaborates on when a sentence is meaningful, when it has a literal, direct sense or when it is meaningful or has an indirect sense.

[[Image:Scrabble tiles en.jpg|thumb|A full English-language set of Scrabble tiles]]

Editions of the word [[board game]] [[Scrabble]] in different languages have differing letter distributions of the tiles, because the [[Letter frequencies|frequency of each letter of the alphabet]] is different for every language. As a general rule, the rarer the letter, the more points it is worth.

Many languages use sets of 102 tiles, since the original distribution of one hundred tiles was later augmented with two blank tiles. In tournament play, while it is acceptable to pause the game to count the tiles remaining in the game, it is not acceptable to mention how many tiles are remaining at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scrabble-assoc.com/build/rules/rules2.html#r2e |title=Official Scrabble Association tournament rules for counting tiles |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223812/http://www.scrabble-assoc.com/build/rules/rules2.html#r2e |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several online tools exist for counting tiles during friendly play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordfind.com/scrabble-tiles/ |title=Scrabble tile counter |publisher=wordfind.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[English language|English]]-language editions of Scrabble contain 100 letter tiles, in the following distribution:

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''E''' ×12, '''A''' ×9, '''I''' ×9, '''O''' ×8, '''N''' ×6, '''R''' ×6, '''T''' ×6, '''L''' ×4, '''S''' ×4, '''U''' ×4
*''2 points'': '''D''' ×4, '''G''' ×3
*''3 points'': '''B''' ×2, '''C''' ×2, '''M''' ×2, '''P''' ×2

*''5 points'': '''K''' ×1
*''8 points'': '''J''' ×1, '''X''' ×1
*''10 points'': '''Q''' ×1, '''Z''' ×1

The total number of points is 187.

When [[Alfred Mosher Butts|Alfred Butts]] invented the game, he initially experimented with different distributions of letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebiggamehunter.com/games-one-by-one/scrabble/ |title=Scrabble |publisher=The Big Game Hunter |first=Bruce |last=Whitehill}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular story claims that Butts created an elaborate chart by studying the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' to create his final choice of letter distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scrabble-assoc.com/info/history.html |title=The story behind Scrabble’s tile distributions |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316172646/http://www.scrabble-assoc.com/info/history.html |archivedate=2010-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Super Scrabble]] was launched. For international distribution outside the United States and Canada, and under license from [[Mattel]], the game is manufactured by Leisure Tends' Tinderbox Games; and, for distribution within the United States and Canada, under license from [[Hasbro]], the game is manufactured by [[Winning Moves]]. This set is composed of 200 tiles:

*4 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''E''' ×24, &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;'''A''' ×16&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;'''O''' ×15&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;'''T''' ×15&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;'''I''' ×13&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;'''N''' ×13&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;'''R''' ×13&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;'''S''' ×10&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;'''L''' ×7&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;'''U''' ×7&lt;/span&gt;
*''2 points'': '''D''' ×8, &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;'''G''' ×5&lt;/span&gt;
*''3 points'': &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;'''C''' ×6&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;'''M''' ×6&lt;/span&gt;, '''B''' ×4, '''P''' ×4
*''4 points'': &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;'''H''' ×5&lt;/span&gt;, '''F''' ×4, '''W''' ×4, '''Y''' ×4, &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;'''V''' ×3&lt;/span&gt;
*''5 points'': '''K''' ×2
*''8 points'': '''J''' ×2, '''X''' ×2
*''10 points'': '''Q''' ×2, '''Z''' ×2

Super Scrabble contains more &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;overlined&lt;/span&gt; and fewer &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;underlined&lt;/span&gt; letters than would be obtained by combining two standard English sets.

Circa 1953, the Production and Marketing Company had provided license to the private company Leon Toys of Johannesburg, South Africa in the manufacture and production of Scrabble. Alongside the English language version of Scrabble the company also produced the first Afrikaans language version of the game under the name Krabbel, a Afrikaans translation of "Scrabble". This language set of the game had the following 100 tiles:

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'':  '''E''' ×15, '''A''' ×9, '''I''' ×8, '''L''' ×4, '''N''' ×7, '''O''' ×6, '''R''' ×5, '''S''' ×6, '''T''' ×6, '''U''' ×2

*''4 points'': '''F''' ×2, '''H''' ×3, '''V''' ×2, '''W''' ×2, '''Y''' ×2
*''5 points'': '''K''' ×3  
*''8 points'': '''J''' ×1

Absent in both the original and standard set of Afrikaans are the letters ''C'', ''Q'', ''X'', and ''Z''. The infrequent ''X'' and ''Z'' may still be represented by the use of a blank, yet the letters ''C'' and ''Q'', not used in Afrikaans but only in a few [[loanwords]], may not be. {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] editions use these 101 tiles:&lt;ref name="The Old English Scrabble Project"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Old English Scrabble Project|url=https://wickedday.wordpress.com/2010/09/21/the-old-english-scrabble-project/|website=Wicked Day|accessdate=11-8-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'':  '''E''' ×14, '''N''' ×9, '''A''' ×8, '''O''' ×6, '''R''' ×6, '''D''' ×5, '''S''' ×5, '''G''' ×4, '''H''' ×4, '''I''' ×4, '''L''' ×4

*''10 points'': '''X''' ×1

Anglo-Saxon uses the letter ''K'', but it only occurs in one word (''kyning'') and loanwords, so there is no tile for it. ''J'', ''V'', ''Q'', and ''Z'' are only used in loanwords. Anglo-Saxon uses the letter ''Ƿ'', but it was replaced by ''W'' in this set because it can be easily confused with P. Anglo-Saxon also uses the letter ''Ȝ'', but it is a typographic variant of G, so that is used instead. This version is hand-made and not an official edition by Mattel.

Although Arabic letters have up to four forms, Scrabble tiles use the isolated form. In some sets, as found in some Arabic-based alphabets that are not the standard modern Arabic, a dotless yeh (alif maqsura) may be used ى&amp;lrm;, and for the letter he the final form &amp;lrm;ھ (heh doachashmee) may appear, as it is in some Arabic-based alphabets, as in Urdu, the isolated form of the letter. The pattern of using the isolated forms in composing words is also found in Arabic crosswords and is one of the rare situations when Arabic letters are not connected to each other.

This version is called '''ԲԱՌ ԽԱՂ''' (''bar khagh'', meaning ''words game'') and is not an official edition by Mattel.

*3 blank tiles (0 points)
*''1 point'': '''Ա''' (ayb) ×18, '''Ե''' (yech) ×10, '''Ի''' (ini) ×10, '''Ո''' (vo) ×8, '''Կ''' (ken) ×7, '''Ն''' (nu) ×7, '''Ս''' (seh) ×6

Notice that this distribution lacks ''և'', another Armenian letter, because:
*The letter is most common by itself.
*It is not a capital or lowercase letter.
However, it can be formed as a ligature of ե/Ե and ւ/Ւ.

[[Catalan language|Catalan]]-language editions use these 100 tiles.

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''E''' ×13, '''A''' ×12, '''I''' ×8, '''R''' ×8, '''S''' ×8, '''N''' ×6, '''O''' ×5, '''T''' ×5, '''L''' ×4, '''U''' ×4

*''10 points'': '''Ç''' ×1, '''L·L''' ×1, '''NY''' ×1, '''X''' ×1

[[Diacritic|Accents]] and [[Umlaut (diacritic)|diaereses]] are ignored; for example, ''À'' is played as ''A''. Nevertheless, there are special tiles for the ''C'' with [[cedilla]] ''[[Ç]]'' (''ce trencada''), the ligature ''[[L·l|L·L]]'' representing the [[Gemination|geminated]] ell (''ela geminada''), as well as the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''[[Ny (digraph)|NY]]''. Playing an ''N'' tile followed by a blank tile to form the digraph ''NY'' is not allowed. Official rules treat the ''Q'' tile as just one letter, but usually Catalan players use the ''Q'' tile like the ''QU'' digraph and all Catalan Scrabble Clubs use this ''de facto'' rule.&lt;ref&gt;http://scrabble3mundial.wordpress.com/normes-generals/&lt;/ref&gt; {{ca icon}} ''K'', ''W'', and ''Y'' are absent because they are only used in loanwords or, in the case of ''Y'', the digraph ''NY''. Blanks cannot be used to represent ''K'', ''W'', or ''Y''.

There is a Catalan Scrabble clone which uses the same 21x21 board as Super Scrabble.&lt;ref&gt;http://blocs.xtec.cat/crpesplugues/files/2012/01/scrabble.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Czech language|Czech]]-language sets use the following 100 tiles:

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'':  '''O''' ×6, '''A''' ×5, '''E''' ×5, '''N''' ×5, '''I''' ×4, '''S''' ×4, '''T''' ×4, '''V''' ×4, '''D''' ×3, '''K''' ×3, '''L''' ×3, '''P''' ×3, '''R''' ×3

*''6 points'': '''Ň''' ×1
*''7 points'': '''Ó''' ×1, '''Ť''' ×1
*''8 points'': '''Ď''' ×1
*''10 points'': '''X''' ×1

''Ö'', ''Q'' and ''W'' are absent because they are only used in loanwords, though all three letters can be played with a blank.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gtoal.com/wordgames/details/czech/slovnik-8bit.html&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably ''X'' does not exist in Czech either, but the manufacturer decided to include it, so that loanwords can be played. The digraphic letter ''CH'' does not appear in this edition and is not representable by the blank (joker);&lt;ref name="Logging Table for Joker Replacement"&gt;{{cite web|title="HLÁSKOVACÍ TABULKA"|url=http://scrabble.hrejsi.cz/prislusenstvi/hlaskovaci_tabulka.htm|accessdate=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''CH'' is instead played as two distinct letters C and H.

Note that this distribution had no ''X'' tile because it was only used in loanwords. This distribution had a ''CH'' tile for the digraphic letter. &lt;!-- Later, 3 '''X''' tiles were added, worth 1 point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.teleport.com:80/~stevena/scrabble/alpha/foreignsets.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters ''F'' and ''R'' are used in Dakelh, but only in loanwords and are very infrequent. ''P'', ''Q'', ''V'', and ''X'' are also absent because these letters are not used in Dakelh.

Before March 1998, there was a difference between the Dutch and the Flemish version: the Dutch version had 2 '''[[IJ (letter)|IJ]]''' tiles with a value of 4 points. Furthermore, it had only 1 '''F''' and only 4 '''S''' tiles; and the face value of the '''G''' was only 2 points. The Flemish version never had '''IJ''' tiles, it was as described above. The Dutch version is now in line with the Flemish one. Instead of the
'''[[IJ (letter)|IJ letter]]''' a combination of the '''I''' and '''J''' is now used. 

Another Dutch version before March 1998 consisted of these 100 tiles:

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''E''' ×16, '''N''' ×8, '''A''' ×6, '''O''' ×6, '''I''' ×4

Esperanto Scrabble exists as an Internet game ([http://skrablo.ikso.net/regularo.php Rules for Esperanto scrabble]) and as a commercially produced custom set.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.creativetrophies.ca/index.php?id=49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Esperanto]]-language sets use these 100 tiles:

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points).
*''1 point'': '''A''' ×8, '''E''' ×8, '''I''' ×8, '''O''' ×8, '''N''' ×6, '''R''' ×6, '''S''' ×6, '''L''' ×4, '''T''' ×4, '''U''' ×4

''Q'', ''W'', ''X'', and ''Y'' are not present, since Esperanto does not use those letters.

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)

*''6 point'': '''Ö''' ×2
*''8 point'': '''F''' ×1
*''10 point'': '''Š''' ×1, '''Z''' ×1, '''Ž''' ×1

Estonian uses the letters ''C'' and ''Y'' but so infrequently that there are no tiles for them. A blank may represent C because it is the most common out of the five foreign letters in Estonian.{{cn|date=August 2018}} Y can also be played as a blank as it is sometimes used as a vowel.{{cn|date=August 2018}} There are also no tiles for ''Q'', ''W'', and ''X'' as they are restricted to outside loanwords and are rare (Quivira, WC, Xerxes.) These letters, however, cannot be played even with a blank.{{cn|date=August 2018}} Arguably ''F'', ''Š'', ''Z'', and ''Ž'' do not exist in Estonian either, but they are sometimes still included for adopted words.

Arguably ''B'', ''C'', ''F'', and ''G'' (outside the digraph ''NG'') do not exist in Finnish either, but they are included as they are used for borrowed words, and ''F'' in some western dialects.

A variant called Alfapet (originally the name of Swedish Scrabble), contains 108 tiles:

[[Stress accent]]s are disregarded. This is called Letrad@s.GZ (originally Scrabble.GZ), and is not an official edition by Mattel. Arguably ''J'', ''K'', ''W'', and ''Y'' do not exist in Galician, but they are included here as they are sometimes used in borrowed words. Blanks do not exist in this game.

[[German language|German]]-language editions of Scrabble contain 102 letter tiles, in the following distribution:

* 2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''E''' ×15, '''N''' ×9, '''S''' ×7, '''I''' ×6, '''R''' ×6, '''T''' ×6, '''U''' ×6, '''A''' ×5, '''D''' ×4
*''2 points'': '''H''' ×4, '''G''' ×3, '''L''' ×3, '''O''' ×3
*''3 points'': '''M''' ×4, '''B''' ×2, '''W''' ×1, '''Z''' ×1
*''4 points'': '''C''' ×2, '''F''' ×2, '''K''' ×2, '''P''' ×1
*''6 points'': '''Ä''' ×1, '''J''' ×1, '''Ü''' ×1, '''V''' ×1
*''8 points'': '''Ö''' ×1, '''X''' ×1
*''10 points'': '''Q''' ×1, '''Y''' ×1

Before the current 102-tile set, German language sets had 119 tiles. With the larger sized tile pool, players had eight tiles at a time on their racks, as opposed to the standard seven. The letter distribution for this larger set is:

* 2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''E''' ×16, '''N''' ×10, '''I''' ×9, '''S''' ×8, '''R''' ×7, '''A''' ×6, '''D''' ×6, '''U''' ×6
*''2 points'': '''H''' ×5, '''T''' ×5, '''C''' ×4, '''L''' ×4, '''O''' ×4, '''G''' ×3, '''W''' ×2
*''3 points'': '''M''' ×4, '''F''' ×3, '''B''' ×2, '''K''' ×2, '''Z''' ×2
*''4 points'': '''P''' ×1, '''V''' ×1
*''5 points'': '''Ü''' ×1
*''6 points'': '''Ä''' ×1, '''J''' ×1
*''8 points'': '''Ö''' ×1, '''X''' ×1
*''10 points'': '''Q''' ×1, '''Y''' ×1

German sets marketed as Foreign Language Editions produced by Selchow and Righter had 100 tiles with the following distribution:

* 2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''E''' ×12, '''I''' ×8, '''N''' ×7, '''A''' ×6, '''S''' ×6, '''R''' ×5, '''T''' ×5, '''O''' ×3, '''U''' ×3
*''2 points'': '''C''' ×4, '''D''' ×4, '''H''' ×4, '''G''' ×3, '''L''' ×3, '''Ä''' ×1, '''Ö''' ×1, '''Ü''' ×1
*''3 points'': '''M''' ×3, '''B''' ×2, '''F''' ×2, '''K''' ×2, '''P''' ×2
*''4 points'': '''Z''' ×3, '''V''' ×2, '''W''' ×2
*''8 points'': '''J''' ×1
*''10 points'': '''Q''' ×1, '''X''' ×1, '''Y''' ×1

Before the Foreign Language Editions produced by Selchow and Righter or the 119-tile distribution produced by J.W. Spear &amp; Sons, James Brunot's Production and Marketing Company produced and outsourced, in the mid-1950s, its production of German sets with a different 100-tile distribution:

* 2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''E''' ×14, '''I''' ×8, '''N''' ×8, '''A''' ×6, '''R''' ×6, '''S''' ×6, '''T''' ×6, '''O''' ×3, '''U''' ×3
*''2 points'': '''D''' ×4, '''G''' ×3, '''L''' ×3, '''Ä''' ×1, '''Ö''' ×1, '''Ü''' ×1
*''3 points'': '''H''' ×3, '''M''' ×3, '''B''' ×2, '''C''' ×2, '''F''' ×2, '''K''' ×2, '''P''' ×2
*''4 points'': '''V''' ×2, '''W''' ×2
*''8 points'': '''J''' ×1, '''Y''' ×1, '''Z''' ×1
*''10 points'': '''Q''' ×1, '''X''' ×1

In 2008, a German edition of the [[Mattel]]-licensed product, [[Super Scrabble]], was released by the game publisher [[Piatnik]]. The set is composed of the following 200 tiles:
 
*4 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;'''E''' ×29&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;'''N''' ×17&lt;/span&gt;, '''S''' ×14, &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;'''I''' ×11&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;'''R''' ×11&lt;/span&gt;, '''T''' ×12, '''U''' ×12, '''A''' ×10, '''D''' ×8
*''2 points'': '''H''' ×8, '''G''' ×6, '''L''' ×6, '''O''' ×6
*''3 points'': '''M''' ×8, '''B''' ×4, '''W''' ×2, '''Z''' ×2
*''4 points'': '''C''' ×4, '''F''' ×4, '''K''' ×4, '''P''' ×2
*''6 points'': '''Ä''' ×2, '''J''' ×2, '''Ü''' ×2, '''V''' ×2
*''8 points'': '''Ö''' ×2, '''X''' ×2
*''10 points'': '''Q''' ×2, '''Y''' ×2
The underlines indicate the distribution contains one tile fewer for the letter than would be if the 102 tiles of the current language set were simply doubled.

&lt;!-- Commented out and moved to the end of this section the table, list and paragraph related to Scrabble3D. The distribution as identified is not yet established. and some of the detail provided is not accurate. (Also, moved the Jpeg here following due to its displacement in the article.)

Note that the letter [[ß]] ''(Eszett)'' is not used. This because it does not exist as a capital letter in German. While a majuscule ß ''(see [[Capital ß]])'' has been established in the context of computing (Unicode), ß is replaced by SS when capitalizing, according to German orthography (e.&amp;nbsp;g. ''Straße'' [street]: STRASSE). However, the [[Germanic umlaut|umlauts]] Ä, Ö and Ü must not be replaced by AE, OE or UE when playing (as would usually be done in German [[crossword]]s where ß is also replaced by SS). Other diacritics which may occur in some foreign words are ignored (é = E, œ = OE etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scrabble.de/pdfs/Reglement20140101.pdf Official German Scrabble rules, rule 2]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- However, one user on Scrabble3D proposed adding the letter ß, worth 8 points (removing an S), and adding one A, one L, and one P, and removing one D, one M, and one U. Also, it was proposed to change the value of the Y down to 8 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=http://www.scrabble3d.info/t239f16-Gehoert-die-Verteilung-der-Buchstaben-reformiert.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The page shows percentages, which means the distribution would be something like this:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=http://www.scrabble3d.info/t239f16-Gehoert-die-Verteilung-der-Buchstaben-reformiert-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has been delayed until the capital ß and the dictionary entries with ß are implemented in Scrabble3D. --&gt;

''P'', ''Q'', and ''X'' are absent because these letters are not used in Gwich'in. Arguably '''B''', '''F''', and '''M''' are not used in Gwich'in either, but they are included as these letters are used for borrowed words.

''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''F'', ''G'', ''J'', ''Q'', ''R'', ''S'', ''T'', ''V'', ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' have no tiles as they are not used in Hawaiian. For the sake of the geocache this is connected to, the distribution had to be modified a bit. For example, there should be 30 A's and 11 K's. The diacritical mark and the okina "'" are ignored.

Four different [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]  language distributions were published by the owners or licensees of the Scrabble brand. In these sets the final form letters '''[[kaph|ך]]''', '''[[mem|ם]]''', '''[[nun|ן]]''', '''[[Pe (letter)|ף]]''' and '''[[tsade|ץ]]''' are not available and the normal form is used.

The most recent edition for Hebrew was published in 2008 by JW Spears and Sons, a subsidiary of Mattel UK with 100 tiles in the following distribution:

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
* ''1 point'': '''[[waw (letter)|ו]]'''&amp;lrm; ×12, '''[[yodh (letter)|י]]'''&amp;lrm; ×10, '''[[he (letter)|ה]]'''&amp;lrm; ×8,  '''[[taw (letter)|ת]]'''&amp;lrm; ×8, '''[[resh|ר]]'''&amp;lrm; ×8

''[[Hungarian dz|DZ]]'' and ''[[Hungarian dzs|DZS]]'', which are fairly rare in Hungarian, have no tiles, nor do ''Q'', ''W'', ''X'' and ''Y'' (outside the digraphs "GY", "LY", "NY" and "TY"), which are only used in loanwords, as part of the extended [[Hungarian alphabet]]. You can still use a blank as a ''Q'', ''W'', ''X'' or ''Y'', but not as ''DZ'' or ''DZS''.

Note that ''H'' is not in this set because it is only used at the beginning of the words starting with vowels, which is against the rules there. Note: This set uses the old orthography. In the new orthography, the dotted letters are replaced by the digraph of the letter without the dot followed by H.

[[Italian language|Italian]]-language Scrabble (originally sold in Italy as ''[[Scarabeo]]'', but that became a different game) applied a special rule that when a player exchanges tiles on his turn, he could request opponent to pass his turn. Both players have one chance each for one game. The sets consist of these 120 tiles:

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''O''' ×15, '''A''' ×14, '''I''' ×12, '''E''' ×11
*''2 points'': '''C''' ×6, '''R''' ×6, '''S''' ×6, '''T''' ×6
*''3 points'': '''L''' ×5, '''M''' ×5, '''N''' ×5, '''U''' ×5
*''5 points'': '''B''' ×3, '''D''' ×3, '''F''' ×3, '''P''' ×3, '''V''' ×3
*''8 points'': '''G''' ×2, '''H''' ×2, '''Z''' ×2
*''10 points'': '''Q''' ×1

Diacritic marks are ignored. The letters ''J'', ''K'', ''W'', ''X'', and ''Y'' are absent since these letters do not exist in the standard Italian alphabet, although they are sometimes used in loanwords.
Another set uses these 120 tiles:

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''A''' ×13, '''E''' ×13, '''I''' ×13, '''O''' ×13

''[[Scrabble variants#Scarabeo|Scarabeo]]'' is an Italian variant of Scrabble that is much more popular in its native country than the original game. It is played with a 17×17 board, and uses these 130 tiles.&lt;ref&gt;http://cineclap.free.fr/_divers/scarabeo-variante-italienne-du-scrabble.jpeg&lt;/ref&gt; It was

*''12 points'': '''ぬ''' ×1

The obsolete letters '''ゐ''' and '''ゑ''', the letter '''を''' now exclusively used as a grammatical particle, and the lengthener '''ー''' have no tiles.

Words are played in "dictionary format":
* Modified letters with the diacritics ゛ and ゜ , as well as the small letters (ぁぃぅぇぉっゃゅょゎ) are played as if they were not modified: e.g. ディスコ (''disuko'' "disco") is played with the tiles ていすこ (''te i su ko'').
* In addition, lengtheners are played by doubling the previous tile's vowel: e.g. ラーメン (''rāmen'' ramen noodles) is played with the tiles らあめん (''ra a me n'').
* These modifications are applied per word; that is, theoretically, the same tile つ can validly stand for づ horizontally, and [[sokuon|っ]] vertically:
::{| class="wikitable"
|-
| || || || あ || ||
|-
| こ || と || は || つ || か || い
|-
| || || || か || ||
|}
* The words played are 言葉遣い (ことば'''づ'''かい ''kotoba'''zu'''kai'') and 悪化 (あ'''っ'''か ''a'''k'''ka''). The player is allowed to extend vertically into 扱う (あ'''つ'''かう ''a'''tsu'''kō'').

This version was created by a student from Japan, and is not in wide circulation.

There are three kinds of [[Latin]]-language Scrabble sets developed by three authorities in the language.

The first distribution, developed by the Centre for Medieval Studies of the [[University of Toronto]], uses these 100 tiles:

* 2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''E''' ×12, '''A''' ×9, '''I''' ×9, '''V''' ×9, '''S''' ×8, '''T''' ×8, '''R''' ×7, '''O''' ×5
*''2 points'': '''C''' ×4, '''M''' ×4, '''N''' ×4, '''D''' ×3, '''L''' ×3
*''3 points'': '''Q''' ×3
*''4 points'': '''B''' ×2, '''G''' ×2, '''P''' ×2, '''X''' ×2
*''8 points'': '''F''' ×1, '''H''' ×1

An extension of the first distribution for Latin Paleography, developed by the Centre for Medieval Studies of the [[University of Toronto]], uses these 120 tiles:

* 3 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''E''' ×12, '''A''' ×9, '''I''' ×9, '''V''' ×9, '''S''' ×8, '''T''' ×8, '''R''' ×7, '''O''' ×5
*''2 points'': '''C''' ×4, '''M''' ×4, '''N''' ×4, '''D''' ×3, '''L''' ×3, '''Ę''' ×2, '''Ē''' ×1, '''Ī''' ×1, '''œ''' ×1, ''';''' ×1, '''ıı''' ×1, '''ııı''' ×1
*''3 points'': '''Q''' ×3, '''&amp;''' ×2, '''Ↄ''' ×1, '''ſt''' ×1, '''V̄''' ×1
*''4 points'': '''B''' ×2, '''G''' ×2, '''P''' ×2, '''X''' ×2
*''5 points'': '''ct''' ×1, '''Ꝑ''' ×1, '''Ꝝ''' ×1
*''6 points'': '''Ꝓ''' ×1, '''P̄''' ×1
*''8 points'': '''F''' ×1, '''H''' ×1
*''10 points'': '''Y''' ×1

The point value of ''Ↄ'' is unknown, but it is believed to be 3. ''Ↄ'', which represents con, can only be played as the first tile of a word. ''Ꝝ'', which represents rum, and '';'', which represents is or us, can only be played as the last tile of a word. ''Ę'' (e caudata), also written as ''æ'', represents ae. ''Ē'' represents em or en. ''&amp;'' represents et. ''Ī'' represents im or in. ''œ'' represents oe. ''Ꝑ'' represents per, ''P̄'' represents prae. ''Ꝓ'' represents pro. ''V̄'' represents vm or vn (as there was no U at the time). Note that ''W'', unlike ''Ę''/''æ'' and ''œ'', which were created at the same time, has no tile because there is no vv digraph in Latin. ''ıı'' represents 2 minims: ii, v, or n. ''ııı'' represents 3 minims: iii, iv, in, vi, ni, or m.

The second distribution below was made "in conjunction with scholars from the University of Cambridge and elsewhere, together with the Cambridge Schools Classics Project." This distribution distinguishes U from V, with the semi-vocalic V scoring five times the points.

* 2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''E''' ×11, '''I''' ×11, '''A''' ×9, '''R''' ×9, '''S''' ×8, '''T''' ×7, '''U''' ×7, '''N''' ×6
*''2 points'': '''M''' ×5, '''O''' ×5, '''C''' ×4
*''3 points'': '''D''' ×3
*''4 points'': '''L''' ×2, '''P''' ×2
*''5 points'': '''B''' ×2, '''V''' ×2
*''6 points'': '''F''' ×1, '''G''' ×1, '''X''' ×1
*''10 points'': '''H''' ×1, '''Q''' ×1

The third distribution is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curculio|url=http://curculio.org/?p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''E''' ×12, '''I''' ×12, '''V''' ×10, '''A''' ×9, '''T''' ×8, '''S''' ×7, '''N''' ×6, '''R''' ×6, '''M''' ×5, '''O''' ×5, '''L''' ×3 
*''2 points'': '''D''' ×3, '''P''' ×3
*''3 points'': '''C''' ×4, '''B''' ×2
*''4 points'': '''Q''' ×2, '''F''' ×1, '''G''' ×1, '''H''' ×1
*''8 points'': '''X''' ×1
However, with this set, according to the rules, if a blank is used as a ''Y'' it is worth 10 points, if a blank is used as a ''Z'' it is worth 15 points, and if a blank is used as a ''K'' it is worth 20 points. Each of those letters are so high in points, because they are used only in borrowed words. The score of 20 for a ''K'' is the highest known point value for any letter in any Scrabble score distribution worldwide. ''Y'' is absent in all sets except the paleographic extension of the first set because it is rare in Latin. ''K'' and ''Z'' are also absent in all sets because they are rare in Latin, while ''J'' is not considered separate from ''I'' in all sets except the third one, in which it is  not included because it is rare in Latin. ''W'' is also absent in all sets because it did not exist in ancient times, and is used only in modern borrowed words.

The combination '''XO''' is absent as it is only used in 7 words (''binxo'', ''ganxo'', ''jerxo'', ''sirxo'', ''xogji'', ''xotli'', and ''xo'u''). The combination '''ZO''' is absent as it is only used in 7 words (''brazo'', ''kinzo'', ''zo'a'', ''zo'e'', ''zo'i'', ''zo'o'', and ''zo'u''). The combination '''['Y]''' is absent as it is only used in 1 word (''.y'y''). The letter '''.''' occurs in Lojban, but it is so infrequent that it has no tile. Blanks can be used to represent any of the above letters (including '''.''') and digrams(including '''XO''', '''ZO''', and '''['Y]'''). The letter '''[']''' occurs in Lojban, but only in digrams and never as one letter. The letters ''H'', ''Q'', and ''W''  are absent, because these letters are not used in Lojban.

The letters ''Q'', ''X'' and ''Z'' are absent since these letters are rarely used in Norwegian. These letters and the foreign letters "Ä", "Ö" and "Ü", which are used in a few Norwegian words, can be played with a blank.

*''9 points'': '''H''' ×2
*''11 points'': '''7''' ×2

This is a handmade set and not an official edition by Mattel. The letters B, D, E, F, G, J, O, R, V and Z are not used in Nuxalk and therefore have no tiles. The 7 is included in the set because it is an actual letter in Nuxalk. It is used to replace ' if you don't have a tile ending with '. Arguably ''H'' and ''7'' do not exist in Nuxalk, but they are included as they are used for borrowed words, or in the case of ''7'', optionally at the beginning of a word.

[[File:Polskie scrabble - paths - ready.svg|thumb|A complete Polish Scrabble set]]

[[Polish language|Polish]]-language editions of Scrabble use these 100 tiles.

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''A''' ×9, '''I''' ×8, '''E''' ×7, '''O''' ×6, '''N''' ×5, '''Z''' ×5, '''R''' ×4, '''S''' ×4, '''W''' ×4

*''6 points'': '''Ć''' ×1
*''7 points'': '''Ń''' ×1
*''9 points'': '''Ź''' ×1

This set has been used since 2000. Before that year, a slightly different configuration was used: '''Ź''' was worth 7 points, '''F''' was worth 4 points, and there were 2 ''Fs'', and 8 ''As''.
The letters ''Q'', ''V'' and ''X'' have always been absent (since they are used in foreign words), and blank tiles cannot be used to represent these.

While ''Ç'' is a separate tile, other diacritical marks are ignored. ''K'', ''W'', and ''Y'' are absent, since they are only present in loanwords in Portuguese, and were not even official letters until 2009.

[[Romanian language|Romanian]]-language editions of Scrabble use these 100 tiles.&lt;ref&gt;http://mosgerila.com/scrabble/ini/distributia_scrabble2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''I''' ×11, '''A''' ×10, '''E''' ×9, '''T''' ×7, '''N''' ×6, '''R''' ×6, '''S''' ×6, '''C''' ×5, '''L''' ×5, '''U''' ×5

*''10 points'': '''J''' ×1, '''X''' ×1

Some amendment applied in updated version. Previously, the '''B''' was worth 8, and the '''O''' was worth 1. &lt;ref name="yout_Dwee"&gt;{{Cite web

The original (1982) distribution used the following 100 tiles:

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''A''' ×11, '''I''' ×10, '''E''' ×9, '''R''' ×7, '''T''' ×7, '''N''' ×6, '''U''' ×6, '''C''' ×5, '''O''' ×5, '''S''' ×5, '''L''' ×4

*''4 points'': '''M''' ×3
*''8 points'': '''F''' ×2, '''V''' ×2
*''9 points'': '''B''' ×2, '''G''' ×2
*''10 points'': '''H''' ×1, '''J''' ×1, '''X''' ×1, '''Z''' ×1

Diacritical marks are ignored, so for example ''Ă'' and ''Â'' are played as ''A''.
Both distributions lack ''K'', ''Q'', ''W'' and ''Y'', since they are only used in foreign words. You can still use a blank to play these letters. Arguably ''X'' does not exist in Romanian either, but it is included as it is used for borrowed words.

The distribution was modified a bit (Dropping ''NG'' because it is too rare, but adding more ''A'', ''E'', and ''I'' tiles, and changing the number of tiles to 100)

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''A''' ×15, '''I''' ×11, '''E''' ×10, '''N''' ×4, '''O''' ×4, '''R''' ×4,  '''S''' ×4, '''PH''' ×1, '''SH''' ×1

*''6 points'': '''È''' ×1, '''Ì''' ×1, '''Ò''' ×1, '''P''' ×1, '''Ù''' ×1
*''8 points'': '''LL''' ×1, '''RR''' ×1

''PH'' and ''SH'' being worth 1 is probably an error; these letters should be worth 10. ''H'' is absent because it is only used in the digraphs above. ''Á'', ''É'', and ''Ó'' are absent since they are rarely used in the Scottish Gaelic language. ''J'', ''K'', ''Q'', ''V'', ''W'', ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' are absent since they are not used in the Scottish Gaelic language. This version is used by Scrabble3D and is not an official edition by Mattel.

[[Slovak language|Slovak]]-language sets use these 100 tiles:

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''A''' ×9, '''O''' ×9, '''E''' ×8, '''I''' ×5, '''N''' ×5, '''R''' ×4, '''S''' ×4, '''T''' ×4, '''V''' ×4
*''2 points'': '''M''' ×4, '''D''' ×3, '''K''' ×3, '''L''' ×3, '''P''' ×3

*''10 points'': '''Ä''' ×1, '''Ĺ''' ×1, '''Ó''' ×1, '''Ŕ''' ×1, '''X''' ×1

''Q'', ''W'', ''Ě'', ''Ö'', ''Ř'', and ''Ü'' are absent because they are only used in loanwords. Arguably ''X'' does not exist in Slovak either, but the designer included it as it is used in loanwords.

Since 2013, a new 112-tile set was introduced:

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''O''' x 10, '''A''' x 9, '''E''' x 8, '''I''' x 6, '''N''' x 5, '''S''' x 5, '''V''' x 5, '''T''' x 4
*''2 points'': '''R''' x 5, '''K''' x 4, '''L''' x 4, '''D''' x 3, '''M''' x 3, '''P''' x 3, '''U''' x 3, '''Á''' x 2, '''B''' x 2, '''J''' x 2, '''Y''' x 2, '''Z''' x 2
*''3 points'': '''C''' x 1, '''Č''' x 1, '''É''' x 1, '''H''' x 1, '''Í''' x 1, '''Š''' x 1, '''Ú''' x 1, '''Ý''' x 1, '''Ž''' x 1
*''4 points'': '''Ť''' x 1
*''5 points'': '''Ľ''' x 1
*''6 points'': '''F''' x 1, '''G''' x 1
*''7 points'': '''Ň''' x 1, '''Ô''' x 1
*''8 points'': '''Ä''' x 1, '''Ď''' x 1, '''Ó''' x 1
*''9 points'': '''Ĺ''' x 1, '''Ŕ''' x 1, '''X''' x 1
*''10 points'': '''Q''' x 1, '''W''' x 1

Arguably the ''Q'', ''W'', and ''X'' tiles should still not be included, but the manufacturer decided to include them, so that loanwords can be played. However, the Slovak Scrabble dictionary contains 4 words with W (not including their declensions) and no words with Q - Q is always transcribed as KV in loanwords.

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''A''' ×12, '''E''' ×12, '''O''' ×9, '''I''' ×6, '''S''' ×6, '''N''' ×5, '''R''' ×5, '''U''' ×5, '''L''' ×4, '''T''' ×4

*''8 points'': '''J''' ×1, '''LL''' ×1, '''Ñ''' ×1, '''RR''' ×1, '''X''' ×1
*''10 points'': '''Z''' ×1

[[Stress accent]]s are disregarded. The letters ''K'' and ''W'' are absent since these two letters are rarely used. According to FISE (''Federación Internacional de Scrabble en Español'') rules, a blank cannot be used to represent ''K'' or ''W''.

Using one ''C'' and one ''H'' tile in place of the ''CH'' tile, two ''L'' tiles for the ''LL'' tile, or two ''R'' tiles for the ''RR'' tile is also not allowed in Spanish Scrabble [http://fisescrabble.org/reglamentos/modalidad-clasica/ (see rules in Spanish provided by the FISE)].

Spanish-language sets sold within North America (known as ''Scrabble&amp;nbsp;– Edición en Español'') use - including "K" and "W" but without "CH" - these 103 tiles:

* 2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''A''' ×11, '''E''' ×11, '''O''' ×8, '''S''' ×7, '''I''' ×6, '''U''' ×6, '''N''' ×5, '''L''' ×4, '''R''' ×4, '''T''' ×4

*''8 points'': '''K''' ×1, '''LL''' ×1, '''Ñ''' ×1, '''Q''' ×1, '''RR''' ×1, '''W''' ×1, '''X''' ×1
*''10 points'': '''Z''' ×1

[[Stress accent]]s are still disregarded. Arguably the ''K'' and ''W'' tiles should not be included in this Scrabble set, but they are anyway, so that loanwords can be played.

In Spanish Scrabble, the tile Q can be played as with or without a U, which means the Q-without-U stuck in most Scrabble variants in other languages does not exist in Spanish Scrabble.

[[Image:Swedish scrabble tiles.jpg|thumb|right|A full Swedish Scrabble set.]]

[[Swedish language|Swedish]]-language Scrabble sets (until 1990 sold in Sweden as ''[[Alfapet]]'', but that became a different game) use these 100 tiles:

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''A''' ×8, '''R''' ×8, '''S''' ×8, '''T''' ×8, '''E''' ×7, '''N''' ×6, '''D''' ×5, '''I''' ×5, '''L''' ×5
*''2 points'': '''O''' ×5, '''G''' ×3, '''K''' ×3, '''M''' ×3, '''H''' ×2
*''3 points'': '''F''' ×2, '''V''' ×2, '''Ä''' ×2
*''4 points'': '''U''' ×3, '''B''' ×2, '''P''' ×2, '''Ö''' ×2, '''Å''' ×2
*''7 points'': '''J''' ×1, '''Y''' ×1
*''8 points'': '''C''' ×1, '''X''' ×1
*''10 points'': '''Z''' ×1

''Å'', ''Ä'' and ''Ö'' have separate tiles; other diacritics like that on ''É'' are ignored (except ''Ü''). ''Q'' and ''W'', found only in loanwords, are absent but can be played with a blank. ''Ü'' and ''Æ'' require a blank, and as of 2010 only occur in one and three playable words respectively: [[Muesli|müsli]] and three forms of [[Laestadianism]] (''læstadianism'' in Swedish).

Originally (starting in 1954), Swedish Scrabble sets (called Alfa-pet, made by the Swedish company Alga, a member of the BRIO Group) used a slightly different distribution:

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''T''' ×9, '''A''' ×8, '''R''' ×8, '''S''' ×8, '''E''' ×7, '''N''' ×6, '''D''' ×5, '''I''' ×5, '''L''' ×5
*''2 points'': '''O''' ×5, '''G''' ×3, '''K''' ×3, '''M''' ×3, '''H''' ×2

*''7 points'': '''J''' ×1, '''Y''' ×1
*''8 points'': '''X''' ×1
*''10 points'': '''C''' ×1

Note that '''Z''' was absent in this distribution as it is almost exclusively used in loanwords. However, it could be played with a blank.

Between 1956 and 1961, the makers of Alfa-pet revised the distribution, altering the number of tiles for the letters ''B'', ''E'', ''N'', ''O'', ''P'', ''S'', and ''U''. The letter ''C'' was reduced in value to 5 and the ''X'' was increased to 10:

*''7 points'': '''J''' ×1, '''Y''' ×1
*''10 points'': '''X''' ×1

Circa 1961, the hyphen was dropped from the game's name, and the original Swedish distribution of the game had been restored. Sometime later, produced under BRIO's subsidiary, Joker, the number of ''T''s in the set were reduced by one and an 8-point ''Z'' tile was added.

In 2002, under the ownership of Mattel and its brand name Scrabble, the Swedish language set tile values of the ''C'' and ''Z'' were changed, respectively, to 8 and 10.

Though Alga had lost its license to Mattel Europa in the early 1990s in the production of the game, the company held onto its ownership of the name Alfapet. ssubsequently it produced a different yet similar crossword board game. Played on a different grid layout, this game is played with a distribution which contains these 120 tiles, with ''Q'' but not ''W'':

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points), 2 black tiles (scoring 0 points), 2 left-pointing arrows, 2 right-pointing arrows
*''1 point'': '''A''' ×9, '''R''' ×9, '''E''' ×8, '''S''' ×8, '''D''' ×7, '''L''' ×7, '''N''' ×7, '''T''' ×7, '''I''' ×6
*''2 points'': '''O''' ×5, '''G''' ×4
*''3 points'': '''H''' ×3, '''K''' ×3, '''M''' ×3, '''P''' ×3, '''U''' ×3
*''4 points'': '''B''' ×2, '''F''' ×2, '''V''' ×2, '''Ä''' ×2, '''Ö''' ×2, '''Å''' ×2
*''8 points'': '''C''' ×2, '''Y''' ×2, '''J''' ×1
*''10 points'': '''Q''' ×1, '''X''' ×1, '''Z''' ×1

The black tile may be put in front of a word to create another word adjacent to the black tile and thus diagonally away from the original word. The arrows lets the player change the direction of a word anywhere between the first and last letter of the word, and are always placed under letters. Anyway, ''Q'' is only used in loanwords in modern Swedish, so it is included.

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)

The letters ''C'', ''Q'', ''V'', ''X'', and ''Z'' have no tiles as these letters are rarely used in Tswana. However, they can still be played with a blank. Diacritical marks are ignored. This is a hand-made edition and not an official one.

The letters ''Q'', ''W'', and ''X'' are not used in Turkish and therefore do not appear in the set.  Blanks may not represent these letters, meaning loanwords that may use them may not appear in the game at all.

[[Image:Welsh Scrabble box.jpg|right|thumb|The box for Welsh-language Scrabble sets.]]
[[Welsh language|Welsh]]-language Scrabble sets use these 105 tiles:

*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)
*''1 point'': '''A''' ×10, '''E''' ×8, '''N''' ×8, '''I''' ×7, '''R''' ×7, '''Y''' ×7, '''D''' ×6, '''O''' ×6, '''W''' ×5, '''DD''' ×4

*''5 points'': '''CH''' ×1, '''LL''' ×1, '''P''' ×1
*''8 points'': '''J''' ×1
*''10 points'': '''NG''' ×1, '''RH''' ×1

Since there are specific tiles for the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s that are considered to be separate letters in [[Welsh orthography]] (such as ''DD''), it is not permissible to use the individual letters to spell these out. [[Diacritic]]s on letters are ignored.

The digraph ''PH'' also exists in Welsh, but is omitted because it is used almost exclusively in [[Welsh morphology|mutated]] words, which the rules disallow. ''K'', ''Q'', ''V'', ''X'' and ''Z'' also do not exist in Welsh. ''J'' does not exist in traditional Welsh either, but it is included as it is used in some borrowed words.

{{wiktionary|TL;DR}}
'''TL;DR''', short for "'''too long; didn't read'''", is [[Internet slang]] to say that some text being replied to has been ignored because of its length. In slang it can also stand for "Too lazy; didn't read". It is also used as a signifier for a summary of an online post or [[Online newspaper|news article]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is 'TLDR'?|url=https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-tldr-2483633|website=Lifewire|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Does TL;DR Mean?

The phrase dates back to at least 2003, and was added to the [[Oxford Dictionaries Online]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;

==Eponyms==
On [[reddit]], tldr&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/tldr|title=Too long; didn't read (TLDR or TL;DR)|work=reddit}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Reddit#Subreddits|subreddit]] serving as the site's daily [[Abstract (summary)|recap]]. Long posts on reddit are also frequently followed or preceded by a summary, consisting of a sentence or brief paragraph, that is prefixed by the phrase "TL;DR", and the abbreviation is sometimes used as a noun denoting such a summary, as in "Please include a TL;DR along with your post".

The phrase inspired the name of [[Terms of Service; Didn't Read]], a website that aims to analyze and grade the [[terms of service]] and privacy policies of major service providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://prospect.org/article/too-long-didnt-read-my-rights | title= Too Long, Didn't Read My Rights| first=Patrick|last= Caldwell| date=August 14, 2012 | publisher= [[The American Prospect]] |accessdate= 2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was found to be very useful by the reddit community which upvoted its summaries hundreds of thousands of times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Squire|first1=Megan|title=Mastering Data Mining with Python – Find patterns hidden in your data|publisher=Packt Publishing Ltd|isbn=9781785885914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qXWDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various applications, services, websites, groups and individuals that summarize lengthy content exist online.{{which|date=February 2017}} [[Wikipedia]] and especially its [[Lead paragraph|lead sections]] can be seen as such a website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chen|first1=Yuqing|title=Letter to the editor: Wikipedia summarizes information|url=http://lavozdeanza.com/letters-to-editor/2016/12/03/letter-to-the-editor-wikipedia-summarizes-information/|website=La Voz News|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=|date=February 2017}}

Furthermore, some journalists have started adding "tl;dr"s to their articles and many already add summarizing subheaders. The uses of such summaries allow readers to decide whether or not they are interested in investing their time in reading the full article.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In the academic community, this concept is known as an "[[Abstract (summary)|abstract]]" and has been used for many decades.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7153">An '''umbrella title''' is a formal or informal name connecting a number of individual items with a common theme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.yale.edu/~okerson/yea/yeaappendC.pdf Description of Metadata Elements in the Yale Electric Library Archive (glossary)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is most often used in lieu of listing separately the separate components or providing a convenient "label" for a collection of [[discipline]]s.

==Uses of umbrella titles==
===Academia===
Nonspecific fields of study are identified by umbrella titles such as "[[physics]]", "[[physical education]]", and "[[medicine]]", to distinguish them from specialized fields of study such as [[exercise physiology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.css.edu/tboone2/asep/julyasep.html Glossary from American Society of Exercise Physiologists newsletter, July 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific conferences and discussions===
Many [[scientific conference|scientific]] and [[academic conference]]s use umbrella titles as unifying themes for the activities scheduled in the course of the conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/cme/cmea/glossary.html Glossary from American Academy of Family Physicians]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment===
Umbrella titles in common use involve either general job descriptions of a group of workers with similar responsibilities (like "teacher")&lt;ref&gt;[http://66.218.69.11/search/cache?ei=UTF-8&amp;p=%22Umbrella+title%22+definition&amp;fr=slv8-msgr&amp;u=www.dps109.org/File.asp%3FID%3D1027%26ws%3D&amp;w=%22umbrella+title%22+definition&amp;d=SsirS_mdOeij&amp;icp=1&amp;.intl=us Collective Bargaining Agreement between Board of Education Deerfield District #109 and Deerfield Education Association, IEA-NEA]&lt;/ref&gt; or rank (military or nonmilitary).

===Politics and law===
Collections of organizations with a common legal or legislative interest are often "united" under an umbrella title for the purposes of [[lobbying]] or participating in a [[lawsuit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sierraclub.org/environmentallaw/blog/2006/09/global-warming-in-supreme-court.asp "Global Warming in the Supreme Court"] - Sierra Club article mentioning umbrella groups (and an umbrella title) in lawsuit&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entertainment and literature===
Umbrella titles are widely used in music, literature, television, and theater. Uses of umbrella titles vary widely in the arts, to a much greater spectrum of use than in other fields of study.

====Music and dance====
Umbrella titles are used to demarcate the music field into general trends or styles: [[classical music]], [[jazz]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umass.edu/fac/media/danilo.pdf University of Massachusetts program for Danelo Pérez concert] - includes history and terminology of jazz&lt;/ref&gt; [[rock music]], [[hip hop]], [[rhythm and blues]] and other labels which each cover more specialized musical styles. A similar "structure" can be found in the field of dance.

Prior to the sale of the [[long playing record]] in 1950, albums containing several 78 revolutions-per-minute records were often sold under umbrella titles (a collection of recordings from ''[[Oklahoma (musical)|Oklahoma]]'', for example).  It can be argued that titles of all long-playing records and [[compact disc]]s are "umbrella" titles—and several such recordings with a common theme often have an umbrella title (such as [[Chip Davis]]' "[[Mannheim Steamroller|Day Parts]]" series) as well.

====Television====
While it can be argued that every title of a televised series, especially those primarily used to designate a time period rather than actual programming (like ''NBC Monday Night at the Movies'') is an umbrella, the term is more appropriately applied to names of [[anthology series]], series that combine together to provide a common theme (such as the three components of ''[[90 Bristol Court]]''), [[wheel series]], and other series under a common heading (such as ''[[Crimetime After Primetime]]'' and ''[[Four in One]]'').

While it was common practice in the 1950s and early 1960s for series to alternate or otherwise share a time slot in [[United States|American]] broadcast network television (for example, ''[[The Jack Benny Show]]'' shared a time slot with, first ''[[Private Secretary (TV series)|Private Secretary]]'' and then ''[[The George Gobel Show]]''), umbrella titles were not used by United States' networks until 1964, when [[NBC]] presented three half-hour programs on Monday nights as a programming block centered at a southern California apartment complex, ''90 Bristol Court''.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh, ''The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present'' (2003) {{ISBN|0-345-45542-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''TV Guide Guide to TV 2006'' (2006) {{ISBN|0-7607-7572-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the 1964 programming experiment did not succeed (two of the series were cancelled; the third lasted the broadcast season but was not renewed for the 1965-1966 season), NBC was not dissuaded from further programming experimentation. Within a decade, the network then experimented with wheel series, first with ''Four in One'' and ''[[The Bold Ones]]'', then with ''[[NBC Mystery Movie]]''.  Afterwards additional wheel series were presented by American broadcast networks, to varying degrees of success. The expirement was revived in 1979 with ''[[Cliffhangers (TV series)|Cliffhangers]]''.

In the United Kingdom, umbrella titles were used in varying degrees in their programming as well. The long-running ''[[Doctor Who]]'' used umbrella titles on several levels, first with individual named episodes under the umbrella of the title of an overall story (the first four episodes were commonly called "An Unearthly Child" even though none of them actually showed it to be the title of the story); even after the naming of individual episodes ceased, umbrella titles were often used to collect [[story arc|stories with a common enemy or theme]] ([[Dalek]]s stories, [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] stories, [[United Nations Intelligence Taskforce|UNIT]] stories, and season-long "Key to Time" and "[[The Trial of a Time Lord|Trial of a Time Lord]]").

====Motion pictures and literature====
The use of umbrella titles in motion pictures parallels their use in literature. Movie trilogies such as ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' and the ''[[Three Colors]]'' trilogy (''a.k.a.'' "Red, White, and Blue trilogy") commonly are called by umbrella titles, as was the case for their literary cousins (such as [[John Dos Passos]]' ''[[USA trilogy|U.S.A.]]'').  Umbrella titles were often used to cover longer sequences of motion pictures or novels (such as the [[James Bond]] and ''[[Star Wars]]'' films and [[Marcel Proust]]'s multi-volume ''[[Remembrance of Things Past]]''). Often umbrella titles are used to collect motion pictures with common stars ("[[Marx Brothers]] movies") or common characters ("[[Dirty Harry]] movies"), as is the case for novels or comics ("[[Perry Mason]] novels", for example). In literature, sometimes an umbrella title is used for a collection of stories with a common locality, such as the [[Wessex]] novels of [[Thomas Hardy]].

'''Volow''' (pronounced {{IPA-xx|βʊˈlʊw|}}; formerly known as ''Valuwa'' or ''Valuga'') is an [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] language variety which used to be spoken in the area of [[Aplow]], in the eastern part of the island of [[Motalava]], in [[Vanuatu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alex.francois.free.fr/AF-field.htm#Vanuatu List of Banks islands languages].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociolinguistics==
Volow has [[Language shift|receded]] historically in favour of the now dominant language [[Mwotlap language|Mwotlap]].&lt;ref name="IJSL"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|François|2012|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now only remembered by a single passive speaker, who lives in the village of [[Aplow]] — the new name of what was previously known as Volow.

The similarity of Volow with Mwotlap is such that the two communalects may be considered [[dialect]]s of a single language.

==Phonology==
Volow, like Mwotlap, has 7 [[phoneme|phonemic]] vowels, which are all short [[monophthong]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|François|2005a|p=445}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LingTyp" /&gt;
