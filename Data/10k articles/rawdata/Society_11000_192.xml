'''''A Subtlety''''' (also known as '''''the Marvelous Sugar Baby''''' and subtitled "''an Homage to the unpaid and overworked Artisans who have refined our Sweet tastes from the cane fields to the Kitchens of the New World on the Occasion of the demolition of the Domino Sugar Refining Plant''") is a 2014 piece of installation art by American artist [[Kara Walker]]. ''A Subtlety'' was dominated by its central piece, a white sculpture depicting a woman with African features in the shape of a [[sphinx]], but also included fifteen other sculptures. These fifteen "attendants" to the sphinx were enlarged versions of contemporary [[Blackamoors (decorative arts)|blackamoors]] produced in China. 

The piece was installed in the [[Domino Sugar Factory]] in the [[Williamsburg (Brooklyn)|Williamsburg]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]] from May through July 2014. Although thematically consistent with Walker's earlier work, its scope and presentation were departures from her oeuvre. 

The project was commissioned by [[Creative Time]] and underwritten by New York-based real estate development company Two Trees, and was built with donated materials. The exhibition sparked conversations about the show's audience, the gentrification of Brooklyn, and the work's themes of race, sexuality, oppression, labor, and the ephemeral.

==Development and presentation==
[[File:Domino Sugar refinery.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Domino Sugar Refinery buildings]]
===Background===

The Domino Sugar Factory site is owned by real estate developer Two Trees, and the bulk of the facility has been slated for demolition as part of the redevelopment since around 2010. Ann Pasternak, the president of Creative Time, reached out to Jed Walentas, both a Two Trees employee and a board member of Creative Time about a show on the site.&lt;ref name=dnainfo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140509/williamsburg/domino-factory-art-exhibition-open-days-before-final-council-vote|title=Domino Factory Art Exhibition to Open Days Before Final Council Vote|last=Varinsky|first=Dana|date=9 May 2014|publisher=DNAInfo|accessdate=28 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231225452/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140509/williamsburg/domino-factory-art-exhibition-open-days-before-final-council-vote|archivedate=31 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Creative Time approached Walker roughly a year before the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2014/05/art/kara-walker-with-kara-rooney|title=A Sonorous Subtlety: KARA WALKER with Kara Rooney|last=Rooney|first=Kara L.|date=6 May 2014|publisher=Brooklyn Rail|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creative Time selected Kara both because "[they] had been trying to get her to sign on to a public artwork for many years" and due to "the obvious historic connections between her work and the site".&lt;ref name=dnainfo/&gt; Walker was attracted to the project in part because of the plant's history and the evidence of the work done there, such as molasses still covering the facility's walls. 

Creative Time and Walker kept details about the project secret from the press. Production required several months of work and a team of more than 30.

===Conception and construction===
Walker first sketched a drawing of the sphinx, which was passed onto a production team.&lt;ref name=creator/&gt; This team created a physical mock-up of the sphinx and uploaded a 3D version to manipulate using a computer. Upon completion, the sphinx was approximately 75 feet long and 35 feet tall, and was constructed from 330 [[polystyrene]] blocks donated by the Insulation Corporation of America. Domino Sugar donated roughly 162,000 pounds (approximately 80 tons) for the sphinx's "skin". The team used roughly half the donated sugar, and applied it to the underlying structure by hand and shovel.&lt;ref name=sugarcoat&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/arts/design/kara-walker-creates-a-confection-at-the-domino-refinery.html|title=Rarely One for Sugarcoating: Kara Walker Creates a Confection at the Domino Refinery|last=Gopnik|first=Blake|date=25 April 2014|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polystyrene was recycled after the exhibit was closed, though the sugar was not.

The blackamoors were based on ceramic figurines found by Walker on [[Amazon.com]] and were enlarged and altered for the show. Five of the fifteen were made of solid sugar. The remaining ten, five holding baskets with bananas and five with baskets held on their backs, were first built from sugar as well. However, they collapsed under the heat, and were replaced with versions made of resin and coated in a layer of molasses.&lt;ref name=creator&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/how-kara-walker-built-a-75-foot-long-candy-sphinx-in-the-abandoned-domino-sugar-factory|title=How Kara Walker Built A 75-Foot-Long Candy Sphinx In The Abandoned Domino Sugar Factory|last=Sokol|first=Zach|date=8 May 2014|publisher=Creators Project|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each statue weighed between 300 and 500 pounds.&lt;ref name=creator/&gt;

==Sculptures==
Walker is best known for her silhouettes depicting stylized scenes from the [[Plantation era|Antebellum South]]. Although thematically similar to earlier works, the sphinx and whole installation was a break with Walker's earlier work in terms of its scale.&lt;ref name=sugarcoat/&gt; The name of the exhibit, ''A Subtlety'' is a reference to sugar sculptures used as decoration or food in aristocratic European households during the Middle Ages known as ''[[Entremet|subtleties]]'' in English-speaking countries.

The sphinx evokes stereotypical depictions of the Southern [[Mammy archetype]]. Consistent with the mammy archetype, the sphinx appears to be overweight and wears a bonnet. Walker's choice to depict a mammy was in part inspired by a [["Mammy memorial"]] intended to be built in the [[District of Columbia]].&lt;ref name=sugarcoat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Horwitz&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwitz|first1=Tony|title=The Mammy Washington Almost Had|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/05/the-mammy-washington-almost-had/276431/|accessdate=4 May 2017|publisher=[[The Atlantic]]|date=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition==
''A Subtlety'' was open to the public from May 10th to July 6th of 2014 on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Entrance to the exhibit required signing a waiver due to the asbestos and lead found in the structure, which was inhaled by those attending. Editorials noted the overwhelmingly white makeup of the audience. Jamilah King, writing for ''Color Lines'' said "...it's reassuring that so many white people have a vested -- or at least passing -- interest in consuming art that deals with race. At the same time I found it unsettling to view art by a black artist about racism in an audience that's mostly white."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorlines.com/articles/overwhelming-whiteness-black-art|title=The Overwhelming Whiteness of Black Art|last=King|first=Jemilah|date=21 May 2014|publisher=Color Lines|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attendees were encouraged to post photographs to social media platform [[Instagram]] using the [[hashtag]] #karawalkerdomino. Many noted insensitive posts by audience members, including "...jokes about the sphinx’s vagina or gag pictures where the subject pretends to pinch [the sphinx's] ass"&lt;ref name=walkerreact&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flavorwire.com/482585/kara-walker-knew-people-would-take-dumb-selfies-with-a-subtlety-and-that-shouldnt-surprise-us|title=Kara Walker Knew People Would Take Dumb Selfies With ‘A Subtlety,’ and That Shouldn’t Surprise Us|last=Herman|first=Alison|date=14 October 2014|publisher=Flavorwire|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a general insensitivity by those in the audience not found at other sites commemorating tragedies, such as the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum|September 11th Memorial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://indypendent.org/2014/06/30/why-i-yelled-kara-walker-exhibit|title=Why I Yelled at the Kara Walker Exhibit|last=Powers|first=Nicholas|date=30 June 2014|publisher=Indypendent|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the close of the exhibit, Walker said that she had anticipated such reactions.&lt;ref name=walkerreact/&gt; 

[[Salome Asega]] and [[Sable Elyse Smith]], New York-based artists, organized a visit to the site for people of color who might otherwise have felt uncomfortable in the space given the behavior of the audience and the lack of structured guidance by Creative Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/previews/we-are-here-people-of-color-gather-at-kara-walker-show-/|title=“We Are Here”: People of Color Gather at Kara Walker Show|last=Goodman|first=Matthew Shen|date=20 June 2014|publisher=Art in America|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gathering, dubbed "We Are Here" distributed informational pamphlets and stickers reading "We Are Here" to those participating.

After the end of the exhibit, the sphinx was disassembled in a process that took a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/12/arts/design/marvelous-sugar-baby-as-a-contribution-to-ephemeral-art.html?_r=0|title=Fleeting Artworks, Melting Like Sugar|last=Gopnik|first=Blake|date=11 July 2014|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker did not participate in the disassembly, and spent time at her home in Massachusetts after the show ended. One piece of the sphinx, the left hand, was retained and shown in November 2014 at Sikkema Jenkins, the gallery which represents Walker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-kara-walker-on-her-sugar-sphinx-the-piece-she-saved-video-shes-making-20141013-column.html|title=Kara Walker on the bit of sugar sphinx she saved, video she's making|last=Miranda|first=Caroline A.|date=13 October 2014|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Walker, the hand is stored in either “New Jersey or Long Island". It is also scheduled to be shown on the Greek island of [[Hydra (island)|Hydra]] in the summer of 2017, beginning June 20th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/04/kara-walker-after-a-subtlety.html|title=Kara Walker's Next Act|last=St. Félix|first=Doreen|date=16 April 2017|publisher=Vulture|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
The central themes of the exhibit included race, oppression, labor, and the ephemeral nature of both the site and the work itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3052">'''An-Nasir Abdallah''' (1811 - April 1840) was an [[Imam]] of [[Yemen]] who ruled in 1837-1840. He was a member of the [[Qasimid]] family, descendants of [[Muhammad]], which dominated the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] [[imamate]] of Yemen from 1597 to 1962.

==Seizure of power==

Abdallah bin Muhammad bin al-Qasim bin Abbas was a great-grandson of Imam [[al-Mahdi Abbas]] (d. 1775). He was originally an imam of the prayer at the Qubbat Mahdi Abbas in [[San'a]].&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City''. London 1983, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1837, the unqualified incumbent [[Al-Mansur Ali II, Imam of Yemen|al-Mansur Ali II]] was deposed by the soldiery of San'a, since their salary was in arrears.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Haykel]], ''Revival and Reform in Islam; The Legacy of Muhammad ash-Shawkani''. Cambridge 2003, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Abdallah successfully made his [[da'wa]] (call for the immate) with the help of his partisans among religious students. The deposed imam and his uncle Sidi Muhammad were kept prisoners by the new ruler, who took the name an-Nasir Abdallah. He took over at a time when the Yemeni lowlands or [[Tihamah]] were occupied by [[Egypt]]ian troops. The viceroy of Egypt, [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]], sent an envoy to an-Nasir Abdallah and summoned him to surrender [[San'a]] to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]. This was politely refused.

==Religious and legislative policy==

An-Nasir Abdallah represented the traditional [[Zaydiyya]] interests, as opposed to the [[Sunni]]-influenced judiciary previously built up by the scholar [[Muhammad ash-Shawkani]]. After his accession he strove to deconstruct the legacy of ash-Shawkani. He introduced a strict legislation where the movements of women were restricted, as well as the use of musical instruments. The [[Ismailis]] living west of San'a were oppressed through his policies. Enraged Ismailis eventually drove the imam's men out of the town [[Jabal Haraz|Haraz]].&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Steven Wilhite, ''Guerilla War, Counterinsurgency, and State Formation in Ottoman Yemen'', PhD Thesis, Ohio State University, 2003, p. 95-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840, an-Nasir Abdallah was murdered by his own servants in his country house. According to another version, the assassins were Ismailis from the [[Hamdan]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; In his stead, Sidi Muhammad was released from prison and raised to the imamate, under the name [[al-Hadi Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Playfair, ''A History of Arabia Felix or Yemen''. Bombay 1859, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Apoquindo massacre''', also known as the '''Apoquindo shootings''', was an incident in Santiago, Chile, on October 21, 1993, in which eight people died after members of the Chilean left-wing guerrilla movement [[Movimiento Juvenil Lautaro]] robbed a [[:es:Banco O'Higgins|Banco O'Higgins]] branch on [[Avenida Apoquindo]], [[Las Condes]], [[Santiago de Chile]], where the bank guard was shot dead.

The assailants boarded a minibus that was intercepted by police officers of the [[Carabineros de Chile]], sparking an assault that resulted in the death of a further seven persons: 3 attackers, 3 passengers on the bus and a police officer. A further 12 people were wounded.

== Background ==
{{main|Terrorism in Chile}}
Although by 1993 Chile had officially become a democracy, the Chilean military remained highly powerful and the [[Constitution of Chile]] ensured the continued influence of General [[Augusto Pinochet]] and his military commanders. This  prevented President [[Patricio Aylwin]]'s government from achieving many of the goals it had set out to achieve, such as the restructuring of the [[Constitutional Court of Chile]] and the reduction of Pinochet's political power.  In spite of the severe limits imposed on Aylwin's government by the Constitution, over four years, it "altered power relations in its favor in the state, in civil society, and in political society."&lt;ref&gt;Linz, Juan J. &amp; Stepan, Alfred. ''Problems of Democratic Transition and Consolidation''. Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; However, organizations including the Movimiento Juvenil Lautaro, the [[Manuel Rodríguez Patriotic Front]] and the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria]] continued to resist the Chilean government, either through nonviolent underground resistance or through armed resistance.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Terrorism'', Sean Anderson &amp; Stephen Sloan, Page 416, Scarecrow Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/05/world/3-us-sailors-injured-in-a-bombing-in-chile.html|title=3 U.S. Sailors Injured in a Bombing in Chile|date=5 November 1990 |newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Terrorism'', By Harvey W.

{{About|ethnic group in Liberia||Bassa people (Cameroon)}}
__NOTOC__
The '''Bassa people''' of [[Liberia]] are a [[West Africa]]n ethnic group primarily found in its central coastal regions. They live in [[Grand Bassa]], [[Rivercess County|Rivercess]], Margibi and [[Montserrado]] counties.&lt;ref name="Olson1996p78"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Stuart Olson|title=The Peoples of Africa: An Ethnohistorical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MdaAdBC-_S4C&amp;pg=PA78|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-313-27918-8|pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Liberia's capital of [[Monrovia]], they are the largest ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patricia Levy|author2=Michael Spilling|title=Liberia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3QIKn5_1tUC&amp;pg=PA92|year=2008|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-3414-6|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an overall population of about 0.57 million, they are the second largest ethnic group in Liberia (13.4%), after the [[Kpelle people]] (20.3%).&lt;ref name=ciafactbook&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/li.html People and Society: Liberia], CIA Factbook, United States&lt;/ref&gt; Small Bassa communities are also found in Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast.

The Bassa speak the [[Bassa language]], a [[Kru languages|Kru language]] that belongs to the Niger-Congo family of languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/17/subgroups/bassa/ Bassa], Ethnologue&lt;/ref&gt; They had their own pictographic writing system but it went out of use in the 19th century, was rediscovered among the slaves of Brazil and the West Indies in 1890s, and reconstructed in early 1900 by Thomas Flo Darvin Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Rozario|title=Liberia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SV4X6TaetGEC&amp;pg=PA53|year=2003|publisher=Gareth Stevens |isbn=978-0-8368-2366-0|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/17/subgroups/bassa/ Bassa: A language of Liberia: Writing], Ethnologue&lt;/ref&gt; The revived signs-based script is called ''Ehni Ka Se Fa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ayodeji Olukoju|title=Culture and Customs of Liberia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOo6fCPSt0QC&amp;pg=PA44|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-313-33291-3|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In local languages, the Bassa people are also known as '''Gboboh''', '''Adbassa''' or '''Bambog-Mbog''' people.&lt;ref name="Asante2009bassa"/&gt;

==Origins==
The Bassa people have a [[Kemetism|Kemetic]] origin, are people who likely left Egypt in early medieval era and migrated south then west, sometime after the collapse of Adbassa Empire and the invasion of the Persians in 6th-century.&lt;ref name="Asante2009bassa"/&gt; Some of them reached coastal West Africa and other parts including Liberia, [[Sierra Leone]], [[Togo]] and [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]] while others settled in central African region of [[Cameroon]] and [[Congo Basin|Congo]]. Geographically separated groups evolved their separate culture, language and society. The Bassa people are related to the Basari people of Togo and Senegal, the Bassa-Mpoku people in Congo regions, the Bassa-Bakoko people of Cameroon and the Balanta-Brassa people of Guinea-Bissau and Senegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Emmanuel Kombem Ngwainmbi|editor=Molefi Kete Asante and Ama Mazama|title=Encyclopedia of African Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B667ATiedQkC |year=2009| publisher=SAGE Publishers|isbn=978-1-4129-3636-1|page=109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Dike DeLancey|author2=Rebecca Mbuh|author3=Mark W. Delancey|title=Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Cameroon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4l9lSZ9d46cC&amp;pg=PA63|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow|isbn=978-0-8108-7399-5|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguistic evidence and oral traditions of these geographically diverse, small yet significant group suggests that their name ''Bassa'' may be related to ''Bassa sooh nyombe'' which means "Father Stone's people". Early European traders had trouble pronouncing the entire phrase, and the shorter form Bassa has been used in Western literature ever since.&lt;ref name="Asante2009bassa"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emmanuel Kombem Ngwainmbi|editor=Molefi Kete Asante and Ama Mazama|title=Encyclopedia of African Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B667ATiedQkC |year=2009|publisher=SAGE Publishers|isbn=978-1-4129-3636-1|pages=108–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
The traditional religion of the Bassa people has a moral and ethical foundation, one that reveres ancestors and supernatural spirits.&lt;ref name="Asante2009bassa"/&gt; Christianity arrived among the Bassa people during the colonial era, and the first Bible was translated into Bassa language in 1922. The adoption process fused the idea of Christian God with their traditional idea of a Supreme Being and powerful first ancestor who is merciful and revengeful, rewarding the good and punishing the bad.&lt;ref name="Asante2009bassa"/&gt; The traditional religion has included secret rites of passage for men and women, such as the Sande society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Daniel Mato|author2=Charles Miller|title=Sande: Masks and Statues from Liberia and Sierra-Leone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RPOwAAAAIAAJ|year=1990|publisher=Galerie Balolu|isbn=978-90-800587-1-2|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous missionaries from different denominations of Christianity have been active among the Bassa people during the 20th century. These has led to many Bassa independent churches from Europe, North America, Africa and Evangelical movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Gifford|title=Christianity and Politics in Doe's Liberia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GFZ_TIc4q6UC |year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52010-2|pages=20, 105–107, 140–141, 197, 215, 228–230 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary times, the Bassa people predominantly practice [[Christianity]], but they have retained elements of their traditional religion.

==Society==
The Bassa people are traditionally settled farmers who grow [[yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[cassava]], [[eddoe]]s and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]. They are a lineage-linked independent clans who live in villages, each with a chief.&lt;ref name="Olson1996p78"/&gt;

'''Capital punishment''' is a legal penalty in Pakistan. Although there have been numerous amendments to the Constitution, there is yet to be a provision prohibiting the death penalty as a punitive remedy.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Pakistan 1973, Articles 200 to 205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://na.gov.pk/uploads/documents/1333523681_951.pdf Retrieved September 8, 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A moratorium on executions was imposed in 2008. No executions occurred from 2009 to 2011, with 1 in 2012 and 0 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/country-search-post.cfm?country=Pakistan&lt;/ref&gt; The moratorium was lifted fully after the [[2014 Peshawar school massacre|massacre of 132 students and 9 members of staff of the Army Public School and Degree College Peshawar]], and routine executions resumed. Pakistan carried out 7 executions in 2014, 326 in 2015, 87 in 2016, and 65 in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Death sentences and executions in 2016|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/5740/2017/en/ |publisher= amnesty.org |accessdate=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hanging]] is the only legal method of execution.&lt;ref&gt;Section 368 Code of Criminal Procedure&lt;/ref&gt;

==A brief overview of the Constitution==
The 1973 [[Constitution of Pakistan]] is divided into twelve parts, with over 250 articles. This fundamental document asserts individual rights and protection, such as the status of women, the right to [[fair trial]], and the [[right to life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://na.gov.pk/uploads/documents/1333523681_951.pdf|title=Part 1 “Fundamental Rights and Principles of Policy”, Articles 9, 10, 11 and 12. Retrieved September 7, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, despite the fundamental right to life entrenched in its Constitution, the Court has jurisdiction to sentence a person to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://na.gov.pk/uploads/documents/1333523681_951.pdf|title=Mainly Part 6 of the constitution, Articles 175 to 204. Retrieved September 7, 2017.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part 6 of the Constitution gives the Court the right to find an individual guilty of any crimes punishable by death under the [http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/1860/actXLVof1860.htmlPakistan Penal Code (Act XLV of 1860)], or any other relevant law.&lt;ref&gt;See the Pakistan Penal Code (Act XLV of 1860), ss 203 to 460.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the Constitution contains a vivid preamble which states that Pakistan ought to follow and operate by Islamic laws and teaching. Whilst retaining the democratic principles entrenched in Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] that of all man are created equal and therefore, should equally be judged under national law&lt;ref&gt;See Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution is a balance between two worlds, Islamic and non-Islamic. Article 31 of the Constitution talks about the ‘Islamic way of life’ meanwhile part 9 contains Islamic provisions.

==Islamic views on Capital Punishment==
As an Islamic state, Pakistan has to follow [[Islamic law]]s, and as a matter of fact, Islam does not reject capital punishment. The ''[[Qur'an]]'' 6:151 States “…take not life, which God has made sacred, except by way of justice and law. Thus, does He command you, so that you may learn wisdom”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/capitalpunishment.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Capital punishment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=6&amp;verse=151|title=The Quranic Arabic Corpus - Translation|website=corpus.quran.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/capital-punishment-in-islam-2003792|title=Does Islam Believe in Capital Punishment?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scripture of the ''Qur'an'' illustrates that, although Islam grants the right to life as seen in the fundamental principles above, it also permits individuals lives to be taken only in ‘ways of justice’.

However, although capital punishment may be allowed, the ''Qur'an'' predominantly teaches forgiveness and peace. [[Muslims]] believe that capital punishment is a most severe sentence but one that may be instructed by a court for crimes of suitable severity, as seen above this is a perfectly painted picture of what the Constitution does. Although murder is deemed as a big sin in most religion, it is also punishable by death in many countries including Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criminaljusticedegreesguide.com/features/10-countries-that-still-embrace-capital-punishment.html|title=List of countries who still practice capital punishment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/znhf9j6/revision/4|title=BBC Bitesize - GCSE Religious Studies - Crime and punishment - Revision 4|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crucial point to note is that one may take a life “by way of justice and law” in Islamic teachings and belief. Henceforth why most Islamic states will continue to allow capital punish clauses in their fundamental documents. As the death penalty can only be applied by the court as a remedy to the victim and their families, in most serious criminal cases. This is often the reasons why most Islamic Republic States like Pakistan will continue such practice.

==Crimes Punishable by Death==
The Pakistan Penal Code contains 27 different offenses punishable by death, including [[blasphemy]], [[rape]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commonlii.org/pk/other/PKLJC/reports/47.html&lt;/ref&gt; sexual intercourse outside of marriage, assault on the modesty of women, and smuggling of drugs. This Code draws its origin from the [[Indian Penal Code]], after several amendments from different governments in Pakistan, the Code is now a mixture of Islamic and [[English law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawsofpakistan.com/pakistan-penal-code-1860-pdf-downlaod-updated-ppc/|title=Pakistan Penal Code 1860 PDF - Download Updated PPC Pakistan|date=31 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Code provides explanations, definition, and punishment for all type of offenses.

Section 302 of the Code governs the punishment for murder, also known as ''Qatl-i-amd'', which is then divided into three categories. The first dealing with death as ''[[qisas]]'', this is the Islamic word meaning retribution, this permits the state to take one’s life for murder, which is also known as equal retaliation, an eye for an eye type of law.  The second type under section 302 is ''[[ta'zir]]'', this is death or imprisonment, this word is an Islamic legal term referring to an offence punishable at the discretion of a judge or state. The third is any punishment of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/1860/actXLVof1860.html|title=Pakistan Penal Code (Act XLV of 1860)|website=www.pakistani.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Code also punishes any act of rape with death or imprisonment, not less than ten years depending on the ‘severity’ of the case.

Section 376 states that if and when the act of rape is committed by two or more individuals with common intention like gang rapes the criminals should meet the fate of death or life imprisonment.
 
Although in many countries insults or defamation of any religion such as Islam is not a crime, in Pakistan this is one of the biggest crimes one can commit. Blasphemy is deemed as a crime not only under the Code but also under Islamic law. This is controversial, as many people believe that this should not be punishable as it violates the fundamental [[freedom of speech]]. The Code address the penalty and offenses relating to religion under section 295B and C. Subsection B punishes any defamation made against the ''[[Holy Qur'an]]'' with life imprisonment.  Whereas, punishment under subsection C is for any written or spoken words direct or indirect made to defile the ‘sacred name of [[Prophet Muhammad]]’ will be punished by death or life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Sections 295B and C of the Pakistan Penal Code.&lt;/ref&gt; Other crimes punishable with death are those of ''[[Fasad]] fil-ardh'', which is any offence of treason (this could be when one leaves Islam to join foreign faiths to combat Islam), homosexual acts (this is prohibited under Islamic laws and teachings) and piracy of any kind. Islam permits the death penalty for anyone who threatens to undermine authority or destabilise the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/capitalpunishment.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Capital punishment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===International Law===
One of the first international treaties to place limits on the death penalty was the 1929 [[Geneva Convention]], this restricted death to prisoners of war taken in armed conflict.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;The Global voice of the Legal Profession “The Death Penalty Under International Law: A Background Paper to the IBAHRI Resolution on the Abolition of the Death penalty”, at p 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The ICCPR was adopted with the aim of restricting the death penalty only for ‘most serious crimes’ in accordance with states law. Although Article 6 of the ICCPR does not expressly prohibit capital punishment, the [[Human Rights Committee]] said its drafting ‘strongly suggests the abolition is desirable’. Despite the lack of such a mandatory requirement, the movement towards abolishing the death penalty worldwide has been increasing rapidly in the last sixty years, particularly since the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]]. At the beginning of the 20th century, only [[Costa Rica]], [[San Marino]] and [[Venezuela]] had permanently abolished the death penalty. At the current time, 133 countries have abolished the death penalty in law or in practice.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Second Optional Protocol to ICCPR==

The [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] published the ''Safeguards Guaranteeing the Protection of the Rights of Those Facing the Death Penalty'', attempted to define the meaning of ‘most serious crime’ in 1984. It asserts that such type of crimes should not go beyond international crimes with lethal or grave outcomes. However, as noted above every state has deferent views to what is a serious criminal offence for their nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibanet.org/Human_Rights_Institute/About_the_HRI/HRI_Activities/death_penalty_resolution.aspx|title=IBA - The Death Penalty Under International Law|first=|last=IBA|website=www.ibanet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008-2014 moratorium==

The Constitution of Pakistan empowers the President to pardon or remit convictions. The [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] government, whose former chairperson [[Benazir Bhutto]] was a well known opponent of the death penalty, came to power in March 2008, and installed its President, [[Asif Ali Zardari]] on 9 September 2008. Upon taking charge of the office, he issued an indefinite moratorium on executions; however, one prisoner was executed in 2012. The moratorium ended on 14 November 2014 when Muhammed Hussain, a soldier, was hanged for murder at [[Central Jail Mianwali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrcp-web.org/showprel.asp?id=173 |title=Capital punishment in Pakistan |publisher=[[Human Rights Commission of Pakistan]] |accessdate=13 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202101146/http://www.hrcp-web.org/showprel.asp?id=173 |archivedate=2 December 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December 2014, after the [[2014 Peshawar school attack|Peshawar school attack]], in which the [[Pakistani Taliban]] murdered 132 children and at least nine others, the authorities announced the moratorium would be lifted for terrorism cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/pakistan-lifts-death-penalty-moratorium-after-taliban-school-attack-1.2875860|title=Pakistan lifts death penalty moratorium after Taliban school attack|date=17 December 2014|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=17 December 2014|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executions immediately resumed, with dozens more following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30577808|title=Pakistan death row inmates face imminent execution|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally on 10 March 2015, Pakistan lifted the moratorium on the use of capital punishment in the country entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/pakistan-ends-death-penalty-moratorium-1841946|title=Pakistan Ends Death Penalty Moratorium|work=International Business Times|last=Sim|first=Shaun|date=10 March 2015|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International criticisms==
===Amnesty International===

[[Amnesty International]] argue that at least 8,200 prisoners were under the death penalty at the end of 2014 and at least 8,500 were thought to be on death row as of June 2015. In October 2015, Minister of State for Interior Muhammad Baligh Rahman told the [[Senate]] that there were 6,016 death row inmates in the country, but it is not clear whether he was referring only to inmates whose death sentences had been finalized on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cornell Center on the Death Penalty Worldwide (Pakistan)|url= https://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/country-search-post.cfm?country=Pakistan#f4-2|website=www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org|accessdate= September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty also alleged that since the lifting of a six-year moratorium on execution, there has been more than 400 carried out by the Pakistani Government. Amnesty found that not only that is a violation of the right to life, but on many occasion, capital punishment is usually imposed after an unfair trial by both the military and the civil courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/pakistan/report-pakistan/.|title=Pakistan 2016/2017|website=www.amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asian Legal Resource Center===

In a recent article, “Pakistan: Government Undermine The People’s Right to Life”  the Asian Legal Resource Center at (ALRC) addressed its concerns to the UN Human Right Council about the Pakistani Government's clear violation of Article 6 of the ICCPR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alrc.asia/article2/2016/03/pakistan-government-undermines-the-peoples-right-to-life/|title=PAKISTAN: Government undermines the people’s Right to Life - Article 2|website=alrc.asia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the ALRC states that Article 9 of Pakistan Constitution states that “No Person shall be deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with law,” yet the country’s civilian and military courts are sentencing people without following due process. Even the façade of the rule of law has taken a back seat as the State gropes in the dark to deter terrorism with judicial and quasi-judicial terror.  They argue that the Pakistani Government are not following international principles or instructions of ‘most serious crimes’ when ordering the killing of vulnerable people usually for the most pity crimes. According to the Human Rights Watch, in 2016 85 people were executed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/pakistan#699e6e|title=World Report 2017: Rights Trends in Pakistan|date=12 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Cochrane''' (1807-1855) was a Scottish author, campaigner for the poor in London in the 'hungry 40s' and, in the last years of his life, campaigner against [[Sunday trading]]. Cochrane was born in [[Madras]], the son of [[Basil Cochrane]] who himself was the sixth son of Scottish nobleman and politician [[Thomas Cochrane, 8th Earl of Dundonald]].

1830 saw the publication of Cochranes' ''The Journal of a Tour Made by Senor Juan De Vega, the Spanish Minstrel of 1828-29''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cochrane|first1=Charles|title=The journal of a tour made by Señor Juan De Vega , The Spanish Minstrel of 1828-9, Through Great Britain and Ireland, A Character Assumed by an English Gentleman|date=1830|publisher=Simpkin and Marshall|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; which recounted Cochrane's tour of Britain and Ireland disguised as a Spanish minstrel, 'exploiting somewhat belatedly the sympathy felt for Spanish refugees after the French invasion of 1823'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fox|first=Celina|title=The Development of Social Reportage in English Periodical Illustration during the 1840s and Early 1850s|journal=Past &amp; Present|date=February 1977|issue=74|pages=90–111|doi=10.1093/past/74.1.90|volume=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cochrane's ''Spanish Minstrel'' was satirised by [[Henry Mayhew]] in his one act play ''The Wandering Minstrel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayhew|first=Henry|title=The Wandering Minstrel|year=1836|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the introduction of the harsh poor laws of the 1830s Cochrane became increasingly concerned with responding in a practical way to poverty, deprivation and hunger in London. In 1842 he founded and became President of the National Philanthropic Association and in 1846 he founded the Poor Man's Guardian Society, 'instituted for the purpose of aiding the destitute in their approach for parochial relief, and for securing them the legal and humane dispensation of the Poor-law.' The society attempted to get the support of [[Charles Dickens]] who was cautious in his response but did pay them a subscription of five guineas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tillotson (ed)|first=Kathleen|title=The Letters of Charles Dickens Volume Four 1844-1846|year=1977|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|page=528}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organisation described Charles Dickens as a vice-president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poor Man's Guardian Society|newspaper=London Pioneer pg. 44; Issue 3.|date=May 14, 1846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cochrane became an increasingly prominent figure in London circles with his campaigns for the poor, advocating radical improvements in sanitation and public health.

By 1848 the NPA had introduced a system of paid street cleaners to West Central London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=National Philanthropic Society (for the promotion of social and sanitary improvements and the employment of the poor, 40, Leicester-square)|journal=The Lady's Newspaper|date=March 20, 1847|issue=12|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2496">'''Collective buying power''' is a coming together of a group of consumers and the use of the old [[rule of thumb]], there's power in numbers, to leverage the group size in exchange for discounts.

== In the marketplace ==
Many different companies have used this concept to build [[business plan]]s. [[Warehouse clubs]] function in a similar way by offering products in bulk to consumers who pay membership fees. In the same sense collective buying power is a cooperative approach to leveraging group size to benefit the consumer by offering

Internet companies have been leveraging this concept, bringing people together online. The company will arrange a coupon offering, that will only go into effect if more than a before agreed upon number are sold.

== Dental industry example ==
One example of a business plan that uses collective buying power is found in the [[Dentistry|dental industry]]. Discount dental plans negotiate dental discounts on behalf of its members. Quality service is not compromised because it is a [[Win-win game|win&amp;#8209;win scenario]] for all stakeholders. While dentists are offering their services at discounted rates, it's still beneficial for them because they increase their patient volume. Patients benefit because they are getting services at discounted rates.

== Similar terms ==
Collective buying power should not be confused with "[[purchasing power]]", "consumer purchasing power", or "collective purchasing power", which is a consumer's ability or a group of consumers' ability to buy goods and services as distinguished from the amount of money a consumer has.

It should also not be conflated with "buying power" or "consumer buying power", which has two definitions. The first, a consumer behavior definition, found in [[economic psychology]] implying the income available for discretionary spending among segments in the population. In short, it is a measure of the ability and willingness to buy goods or services. The second is an industrial definition, which refers to the relative influence an individual or a job function (engineering, purchasing, production) has in a purchasing decision. Power may be based on reward abilities (granting monetary or perceptual benefits), coercion, legitimacy, personality, or expertise.

The '''Dawro''' are a people of southern [[Ethiopia]], also known as the Omete. They speak a Dawragna language. 

During the nineteenth century, the Dawro lived in an independent state known as the Kingdom of Dawro. In 2000, the [[Dawro Zone]] was split off from the former [[Semien Omo Zone]] in the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region]]. It consists of the [[woredas]] of [[Isara Tocha]], [[Loma Bosa]], and [[Mareka Gena]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6118">The '''Erbreichsplan''' ([[German language|German]] for ''Plan for a Hereditary Empire'') was a plan formed by the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] to change the Holy Roman Empire from an [[elective monarchy|elective]] to a [[hereditary monarchy]]. Such a move would have drastically changed the character of the Empire, but Henry was unable to garner sufficient support for the plan and it was ultimately forgotten.

==Background==

Henry, who had been crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1191, was known for being highly aggressive in guarding and expanding the rights of the imperial crown. In 1194 he also invaded the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] and conquered it from its king, [[William III of Sicily|William III]]. That same year his wife [[Constance of Sicily|Constance]] gave birth to a son, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], who would, if all went well, inherit both the Imperial title and the Kingdom of Sicily. It was Henry's dream to have the Empire and Sicily permanently unified under the [[House of Hohenstaufen]].&lt;ref&gt;Hampe, p. 224; Haverkamp, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately for Henry's plans, however, the Empire was an elective monarchy, meaning that the Hohenstaufens' hold on the imperial title depended on a favorable [[Prince-elector|election by the princes]] after the death of every Emperor. The dynasty's hold on the empire could never be secure as long as the princes controlled the electoral process. Henry was aware of developments in other European countries such as [[Kingdom of France|France]], where the principle of hereditary monarchy was firmly established and the strength of the crown was increasing. Henry ultimately decided on pursuing a way to change the imperial title into a hereditary one, and attempted to gain the support of the princes of the Empire.

The secular princes, for their part, feared Henry's extensive powers. Although hereditary succession for princes (''Leihezwang'') had become customary within the Empire, it was still not a formal right and on multiple occasions Henry refused to [[enfeoff]] the direct heir of a deceased prince with the latter's territory (the most notable example of this being Henry's seizure of the [[Margraviate of Meissen]] in 1195 as a vacant fief after the death of [[Albert I, Margrave of Meissen|Albrecht the Proud]], rather than enfeoffing Albrecht's brother [[Dietrich I, Margrave of Meissen|Dietrich I]] with the margraviate).&lt;ref&gt;Hampe, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the princes were nervous about their rights of inheritance and were willing to grant certain concessions to the Emperor in exchange for the preservation of these rights.

==The Plan==

After his capture of Sicily in 1194 Henry was busy organizing for a possible [[crusade]] and negotiating over the election of his son Frederick as his successor within the Empire. The secular princes in the meantime made their desire for hereditary imperial fiefs, and for the recognition of the capacity for inheritance by the female line as well, known.&lt;ref name="Haverkamp, p. 237"&gt;Haverkamp, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; By agreeing to consider these demands Henry was able to gain the acceptance by a majority of the secular princes for the idea of hereditary monarchy. Henry also bought the support of the ecclesiastical princes by announcing that he would be willing to give up the right of [[jus spolii]], which had for years been used against Church lands.&lt;ref&gt;Hampe, p. 226; Haverkamp, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the high degree of support he had from the secular and ecclesiastical princes for the idea, however, Henry was unable to secure an agreement in writing. The first obstacle to the plan was the [[Archbishop of Cologne]], [[Adolf of Altena]].&lt;ref name="Haverkamp, p. 237"/&gt; Besides being opposed towards Henry's rule in general, Adolf was unwilling to give up the significant level of influence that his position traditionally held over the imperial election. When he aroused the resistance of several [[Saxony (disambiguation)|Saxon]] and [[Thuringia]]n princes against the Emperor, Henry realized that he would be unable to establish hereditary monarchy without resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Hampe, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry next turned to the [[papacy]], hoping that if he could get the support of the pope that the matter would be settled. [[Pope Celestine III]], however, had many reasons to oppose such a plan, including the classic papal opposition to the expansion of Imperial power in Italy. Henry tried to compromise with Celestine, offering to meet several papal demands and probably offering a financial incentive. Ultimately the pope decided that the hazards of a hereditary monarchy were too great and refused to support Henry.&lt;ref&gt;Hampe, p. 226; Haverkamp, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry now found his campaign to turn his office into a hereditary one stalled. He gave up on his plans for the time being, in the meantime securing the election of Frederick as [[King of the Romans]] in late 1196. Over the next year he was bogged down by a revolt in Sicily and preparations for the Crusade, when he suddenly died in September 1197. His death put a definitive end to his plans for hereditary Imperial succession; the issue was quickly forgotten as the Empire quickly descended into civil war between [[Philip of Swabia]] and [[Otto IV]]. Henry's attempts to turn the Imperial title into a hereditary one were ultimately futile, and the Holy Roman Empire remained an elective monarchy (albeit ''de-facto'' [[House_of_Habsburg#Holy_Roman_emperors|under the Habsburgs]] for the last four centuries, with a brief interruption) all the way up until its dissolution in 1806.

It is widely believed that the play is one of the manifestations of the customary [[African culture|African]] revelry that serves as the forerunner of the modern [[Brazilian Carnival|carnival]] in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name="TravelIntel"&gt;http://www.travelintelligence.com/travel-writing/2919/Africa-and-Middle-East/Nigeria/Lagos/Lagos/The-Eyo-Festival.html&lt;/ref&gt; On Eyo Day, the main highway in the heart of the city (from the end of Carter Bridge to Tinubu Square) is closed to traffic, allowing for procession from Idumota to the [[Iga Idunganran]] palace.  The white-clad Eyo masquerades represent the spirits of the dead, and are referred to in [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] as "agogoro Eyo" (literally: "tall Eyo").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EYO: Its purpose and role in the history of Lagos|url=http://eyofestivallagos.com/origin.php|work=Eyo Festival Lagos website|accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eyo Iga Jump.jpg|thumb|upright|An Eyo Iga Olowe Salaye masquerade jumping.]]
The first procession in Lagos was on the 20th of February, 1854, to commemorate the life of the [[Oba of Lagos|Oba]] [[Akintoye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Lizzie|title=Nigeria|year=2008|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|location=Chalfont St. Peter|isbn=978-1-84162-239-2|pages=148|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fwuQ71ZbaOcC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=oba+akintoye+1854&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mCHNTsQ8zc7hBK7jxaEI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=oba%20akintoye%201854&amp;f=false|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, the participants all pay homage to the reigning [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] of Lagos. The festival takes place whenever occasion and tradition demand, though it is usually held as part of the final burial rites of a highly regarded chief in the king's court.&lt;ref name=online /&gt;

Among the [[Yoruba people|Yorubas]], the indigenous religions have largely lost the greater majority of their traditional followers to Christianity and Islam. Be that as it may, the old festivals are still almost universally observed as tourist attractions which generate a lot of revenue for government and small businesses around the [[Lagos Island]] venue of the Eyo festival. It is during these occasions that their traditional monarchs and nobles exercise the most of their residual power.

==Order of events==
In his book [https://www.amazon.com/Nigerian-Festivals-Famous-Not-So-ebook/dp/B00FKBAO9G Nigerian Festivals], travel writer and culture reporter [[Pelu Awofeso]] notes: A full week before the festival&lt;ref name="TravelIntel" /&gt; (always a Sunday), the ‘senior’ eyo group, the Adimu (identified by a black, broad-rimmed hat), goes public with a staff. When this happens, it means the event will take place on the following Saturday. Each of the four other ‘important’ groups — Laba (Red), Oniko (yellow), Ologede (Green) and Agere (Purple) — take their turns in that order from Monday to Thursday.

== History ==
Historically, Iperu is the source, cradle and originator of Eyo in Nigeria and the world. There are 5 different branches/types of Iga Eyo in Iperu ''Akesan''

'''Names of the families and Iga of Eyo each represents are:'''

# Iga Pakerike which is symbolized by red cap of éyo
# Iga Agbonmagbe,also symbolized by blue cap of éyo.
# Iga éyo Odoru
# Iga éyo Mogusen/Amororo
# Iga éyo Fibigbuwa

The '''major source''' of éyo in Iperu is the Iga éyo Pakeriké and other 4 are the Iperu Royal houses.&lt;blockquote&gt;History made us to understand that Eyó was brought to Lagos to entertain an in-law which has now become something more celebrated in Lagos today.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''FIRE economy''' is any economy based primarily on the '''F'''inance, '''I'''nsurance, and '''R'''eal '''E'''state sectors. Finance, insurance, and real estate are United States census bureau classifications. Barry Popik describes some early uses as far back as 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/fire_finance_insurance_real_estate_ice_intellectual_cultural_educational/|title=The Big Apple: FIRE (Finance, Insurance, Real Estate) &amp; ICE (Intellectual, Cultural, Educational)|author=Barry Popik|work=barrypopik.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008, the term has been commonly used by [[Michael Hudson (economist)|Michael Hudson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fireeconomy.com/|title=Official FIRE Economy site|work=fireeconomy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eric Janszen]].&lt;ref&gt;http://harpers.org/archive/2008/02/0081908&lt;/ref&gt;

It is [[New York City]]'s largest industry and a prominent part of the service industry in the U.S. overall economy and other Western, developed countries.

==Census Bureau classification==
This term is frequently used in the financial press and blogs. Its origin is in the realm of North American industrial classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/fire_finance_insurance_real_estate_ice_intellectual_cultural_educational/|title=Double-Tongued Word Wrester Dictionary|first=Barry|last=Popik|website=www.barrypopik.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate" is the title of ''1992 U.S. Census Bureau Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Division H''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/epcd/www/sic.html|title=1992 U.S. Census Bureau Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Division H|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its coverage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/econ/www/se0100.html|title=CENSUS OF FINANCE, INSURANCE, AND REAL ESTATE|work=census.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; was "All domestic establishments that provide financial, insurance, or real estate services."  Its coverage was elaborated&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/epcd/ec97brdg/INDXSIC2.HTM#H&lt;/ref&gt; in two-digit SIC codes 60 through 67.  The SIC was replaced by the North American (Canada, USA, Mexico) Industry Classification System&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; (NAICS) starting in 1997. The SIC had ten top-level divisions, NAICS has twenty.  The new NAICS essentially split the old Division H into code 52 Finance and Insurance&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/epcd/www/97EC52.HTM&lt;/ref&gt; and code 53 Real Estate and Rental and Leasing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/epcd/www/97EC53.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;

The newer NAIC two-digit codes, 52 and 53, are extensively elaborated – down to the five-digit level. They remain largely unchanged in the 2007 NAICS drill down chart&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2007|title=NAICS Search|author=Pam Sadowski, SSSD|work=census.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose details are this for code 52&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart_code=52&amp;search=2007%20NAICS%20Search|title=NAICS Search|author=Pam Sadowski, SSSD|work=census.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this for code 53.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart_code=53&amp;search=2007%20NAICS%20Search|title=NAICS Search|author=Pam Sadowski, SSSD|work=census.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naicsect.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/epcd/ec97brdg/&lt;/ref&gt;

The second use of the term derives from the study of financial capital and income – as opposed to industrial capital and income. To characterize the so-called financial services industries, economists carved out part of the SIC/NAIS breakdown of types of industry: finance, insurance, and real estate. They contracted this to FIRE, deliberately invoking the negative connotations which were, at least then, contrary to [[conventional wisdom]]. The following table elaborates on this dichotomy in the header row and gives examples in ensuing rows.

At the city scale, Sassen has done a lot of researches of the FIRE influences to the Global Cities, such New York, London and Tokyo, since 1984.&lt;ref&gt;The global city : New York, London, Tokyo (Princeton : Princeton University Press, 2001) updated 2d ed., original 1991; {{ISBN|0-691-07063-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She and a group of scholars like Feistein, argued that FIRE aggravated social inequality and polarization of these cities.

==Criticisms==

Much criticism exists on the shifting of the U.S. economy to a FIRE economy at the expense of a manufacturing and export-based economy. As the consumer of last resort, many believe that the United States has eschewed productive elements of its economy in favor of consumption to its long term detriment.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Particularly after 1973 … pundits of the status quo hailed the proliferation of the "FIRE" (finance, insurance, real estate) economy as the coming of a new "service" "post-industrial" economy that would replace the old "smokestack" economy and the jobs lost through plant closings, restructuring, and down-sizing …''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~lrgoldner/dollarcrisis.html|title=Loren Goldner|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830062709/http://www.home.earthlink.net/~lrgoldner/dollarcrisis.html|archivedate=2008-08-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fair Sentencing Act of 2010''' ({{USPL|111|220}}) was an Act of Congress that was signed into federal law by U.S. President Barack Obama on August 3, 2010 that reduces the disparity between the amount of [[crack cocaine]] and powder [[cocaine]] needed to trigger certain [[Federal crime|federal criminal]] penalties from a 100:1 weight ratio to an 18:1 weight ratio and eliminated the five-year [[mandatory sentencing|mandatory minimum sentence]] for simple possession of crack cocaine, among other provisions.&lt;ref name=famm&gt;[http://www.famm.org/FederalSentencing/USCongress/BillsinCongress/TheFairSentencingActof2010.aspx Fair Sentencing Act of 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303203132/http://www.famm.org/FederalSentencing/USCongress/BillsinCongress/TheFairSentencingActof2010.aspx |date=March 3, 2012 }}, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, famm.org, accessed September 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar bills were introduced in several [[U.S. Congress]]es before its passage in 2010, and courts had also acted to reduce the sentencing disparity prior to the bill's passage.

The [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986]] implemented the initial disparity, reflecting Congress's view that crack cocaine was a more dangerous and harmful drug than powder [[cocaine]]. In the decades since, extensive research by the [[United States Sentencing Commission]] and other experts has suggested that the differences between the effects of the two drugs are exaggerated and that the sentencing disparity is unwarranted. Further controversy surrounding the 100:1 ratio was a result of its description by some as being [[Race (human categorization)|racially]] biased and contributing to a disproportionate number of African Americans being sentenced for crack cocaine offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webb|first=Gary|year=1999|pp=282|title=[[Dark Alliance]]|publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]]|isbn=978-1-888363-93-7|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Legislation to reduce the disparity has been introduced since the mid-1990s, culminating in the signing of the Fair Sentencing Act.

The Act has been described as improving the fairness of the federal criminal justice system, and prominent politicians and non-profit organizations have called for further reforms, such as making the law retroactive and complete elimination of the disparity (i.e., enacting a 1:1 sentencing ratio).

==Background==
{{Further|Crack epidemic (United States)}}
The use of [[crack cocaine]] increased rapidly in the 1980s, accompanied by an increase in violence in urban areas.&lt;ref name=Datashow&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politics.usnews.com/news/articles/2010/08/03/data-show-racial-disparity-in-crack-sentencing.html|work=US News and World Report| title=Data Show Racial Disparity in Crack Sentencing|first=Danielle|last=Kurtzleben|date= August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, the [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986]] included a provision that created the disparity between federal penalties for crack cocaine and powder cocaine offenses, imposing the same penalties for the possession of an amount of crack cocaine as for 100 times the same amount of powder cocaine.  The law also contained minimum sentences and other disparities between the two forms of the drug.&lt;ref name=Durbinrelease&gt;[http://durbin.senate.gov/showRelease.cfm?releaseId=326778 Durbin's Fair Sentencing Act Passed By House, Sent to President for Signature], durbin.senate.gov, accessed September 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sentencing disparity and effects===
In the three decades prior to the passing of the Fair Sentencing Act, those who were arrested for possessing crack cocaine faced much more severe penalties than those in possession of powder cocaine.  While a person found with five grams of crack cocaine faced a five-year mandatory minimum prison sentence, a person holding powder cocaine could receive the same sentence only if he or she held five hundred grams. Similarly, those carrying ten grams of crack cocaine faced a ten-year mandatory sentence, while possession of one thousand grams of powder cocaine was required for the same sentence to be imposed.&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/02/AR2010080204360.html The Fair Sentencing Act corrects a long-time wrong in cocaine cases], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', August 3, 2010, accessed September 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, Congress provided the following five reasons for the high ratio: crack cocaine was more addictive than powder cocaine; crack cocaine was associated with violent crime; youth were more likely to be drawn to crack cocaine; crack cocaine was inexpensive, and therefore more likely to be consumed in large quantities; and use of crack cocaine by pregnant mothers was dangerous for their unborn children.&lt;ref name=FordhamLawReview&gt;Beaver, Alyssa L. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120229184659/http://law.fordham.edu/assets/LawReview/Beaver_April_2010.pdf Getting a Fix on Cocaine Sentencing Policy: Reforming the Sentencing Scheme of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986],''[[Fordham Law Review]]'', vol. 78, April 2010, accessed October 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study released in 1997 examined the addictive nature of both crack and powder cocaine and concluded that one was no more addictive than the other. The study explored other reasons why crack is viewed as more addictive and theorized, "a more accurate interpretation of existing evidence is that already abuse-prone cocaine users are most likely to move toward a more efficient mode of ingestion as they escalate their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first = Craig | last =  Reinarman| first2 = Dan| last2 = Waldorf| first3 = Sheigla B.| last3 = Murphy| first4 = Harry G.| last4 = Levine| editor-last = Reinarman | editor-first = Craig| editor2-last = Levine| editor2-first = Harry G.| contribution = The Contingent Call of the Pipe: Bingeing and Addiction Among Heavy Cocaine Smokers | title = Crack in America: Demon Drugs and Social Justice | year = 1997 | place = Berkeley, California | publisher = University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' commented, "There was never any scientific basis for the disparity, just panic as the crack epidemic swept the nation's cities."&lt;ref name=AboutTime&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/31/opinion/la-ed-sentencing-20100731|title=The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010: It's about time|author=Editorial|date=July 31, 2010|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sentencing disparity between these two drug offenses is perceived by a number of commentators as racially biased.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=5|publisher=Mich. J. Race &amp; L.|pages=611|date=1999–2000|title=Cracking the Code: De-Coding Colorblind Slurs during the Congressional Crack Cocaine Debates|author=Dvorak, Richard|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/mjrl5&amp;section=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=3|publisher=Geo. Mason Indep. L. Rev. 473|date=1994–1995|title=Punishment for Just Us - A Constitutional Analysis of the Crack Cocaine Sentencing Statutes|author=Wytsma, Laura A.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/gmlr3&amp;section=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995, the U.S. Sentencing Commission concluded that the disparity created a "racial imbalance in federal prisons and led to more severe sentences for low-level crack dealers than for wholesale suppliers of powder cocaine. ...  As a result, thousands of people – mostly African Americans – have received disproportionately harsh prison sentences."&lt;ref name=WashPost/&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutTime/&gt;&lt;ref name=listofproposals&gt;[http://www.drugpolicy.org/library/factsheets/effectivenes/index.cfm#notes Effectiveness of the War on Drugs], [[Drug Policy Alliance]], accessed October 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[United States Sentencing Commission]] "found that the ratio was created based upon a misperception of the dangers of crack cocaine, which had since been proven to have a less drastic effect than previously thought."&lt;ref name=FordhamLawReview/&gt;  In 2009, the U.S. Sentencing Commission introduced figures stating that no class of drug is as racially skewed as crack in terms of numbers of offenses.  According to the data, 79% of 5,669 sentenced crack offenders were black, while only 10% were white and 10% were Hispanic. The figures for the 6,020 powder cocaine convictions, in contrast, were as follows: 17% of these offenders were white, 28% were black, and 53% were Hispanic. Combined with a 115-month average imprisonment for crack offenses, compared with an average of 87 months for cocaine offenses, the sentencing disparity results in more African-Americans spending more time in the prison system.&lt;ref name=Datashow/&gt;

[[Asa Hutchinson]], the former administrator of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] under President [[George W. Bush]], commented that because of the disparate treatment of these two offenses, "the credibility of our entire drug enforcement system is weakened."&lt;ref name=Durbinrelease/&gt;  The U.S. Sentencing Commission also released a statement saying that "perceived improper racial disparity fosters disrespect for and lack of confidence in the criminal justice system."&lt;ref name=Durbinrelease/&gt;  According to [[U.S. Senator]] [[Dick Durbin]], "The sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine has contributed to the imprisonment of African Americans at six times the rate of Whites and to the United States' position as the world's leader in incarcerations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/15/AR2009101501992.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Bill Targets Sentencing Rules For Crack and Powder Cocaine | first=Carrie | last=Johnson | date=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempts to change the disparity===

====Legal challenges====
Although the 100:1 federal sentencing ratio remained unchanged from 1986 to 2010, two [[U.S. Supreme Court]] cases provided lower courts with discretion in determining penalties for cocaine convictions.  ''[[Kimbrough v. United States]]'' (2007) and ''Spears v. United States''&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD DATE --&gt; gave lower courts the option to set penalties and allowed judges who disagreed with the [[United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines|Federal Sentencing Guidelines]] to depart from the statutory ratio based on policy concerns.

Jr.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/thurlr33&amp;section=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Proposed legislation====
The U.S. Sentencing Commission first called for reform of the 100:1 sentencing disparity in 1994 after a year-long study on the differing penalties for powder and crack cocaine required by the Omnibus [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]]. The Commission found that the sentencing disparity was unjustified due to the small differences between the two forms of cocaine, and advised Congress to equalize the quantity ratio that would trigger mandatory sentences.  Congress rejected the Commission's recommendations for the first time in the Commission's history.&lt;ref name=sentencingproject&gt;[http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/dp_crack_sentencing.pdf "Federal Crack Cocaine Sentencing"], The Sentencing Project, sentencingproject.org, accessed October 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1997, the Commission again recommended a reduction in the disparity, providing Congress with a range from 2:1 to 15:1 to choose from. This recommendation would have raised the quantity of crack and lowered the quantity of powder cocaine required to trigger a mandatory minimum sentence. Congress did not act on this recommendation. In 2002, the Commission again called for reducing sentencing disparities in its Report to Congress based on extensive research and testimony by medical and scientific professionals, federal and local law enforcement officials, criminal justice practitioners, academics, and civil rights organizations.&lt;ref name=sentencingproject/&gt;

Congress first proposed bipartisan legislation to reform crack cocaine sentencing in 2001, when Senator [[Jeff Sessions]] (R-AL) introduced the Drug Sentencing Reform Act. This proposal would have raised the amount of crack cocaine necessary for a five-year mandatory minimum from 5&amp;nbsp;grams to 20&amp;nbsp;grams and would have lowered the amount of powder cocaine necessary for the same sentence from 500&amp;nbsp;grams to 400&amp;nbsp;grams, a 20:1 ratio.&lt;ref name=sentencingproject/&gt;  During the [[110th United States Congress]], seven crack cocaine sentencing reform bills were introduced that would have reduced the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses without increasing mandatory sentences.&lt;ref name=sentencingproject/&gt;

In the Senate, [[Orrin Hatch]] (R-UT) sponsored the Fairness in Drug Sentencing Act of 2007 (S. 1685) that would have created a 20:1 ratio by increasing the five-year quantity trigger for mandatory minimum sentences for crack cocaine to 25 grams and leaving the powder cocaine level at 500 grams.&lt;ref name=sentencingproject/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hatch&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-1685 S. 1685: Fairness in Drug Sentencing Act of 2007], govtrack.us, accessed October 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Former senator and former [[Vice President of the United States]] [[Joe Biden]] sponsored the Drug Sentencing Reform and Cocaine Kingpin Trafficking Act of 2007 (S. 1711), which would have completely eliminated the disparity by increasing the amount of crack cocaine required for the imposition of mandatory minimum prison terms to those of powder cocaine.&lt;ref name=sentencingproject/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biden&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-1711 S. 1711: Drug Sentencing Reform and Cocaine Kingpin Trafficking Act of 2007], govtrack.us, accessed October 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of these bills would have eliminated the five-year mandatory minimum prison term for first-time possession of crack cocaine.&lt;ref name=Hatch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biden/&gt; In the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], [[Sheila Jackson Lee]] (D-TX) sponsored the Drug Sentencing Reform and Cocaine Kingpin Trafficking Act of 2007 (H.R. 4545), the companion to Biden's proposed bill.&lt;ref name=sentencingproject/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-4545 H.R.4545: Drug Sentencing Reform and Cocaine Kingpin Trafficking Act of 2007], govtrack.us, accessed October 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles B. Rangel|Charles Rangel]] sponsored the Crack-Cocaine Equitable Sentencing Act of 2007 (H.R. 460), a bill he had been introducing since the mid-1990s that would have equalized cocaine sentencing and eliminated specified mandatory minimum penalties relating to the trafficking in, and possession, importation, or distribution of, crack cocaine.&lt;ref name=sentencingproject/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-460 H.R.460: Crack-Cocaine Equitable Sentencing Act of 2007], govtrack.us, accessed October 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed [[FIRST STEP Act]] would retroactively apply the Fair Sentencing Act, aiding around 2,600 prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mitch McConnell faces tough choice on criminal justice proposal|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/02/politics/mitch-mcconnell-criminal-justice-plan/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=2 December 2018|author=Rogers, Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opposition to the Act====
Some members of Congress opposed the Act.  [[Lamar S. Smith]] (R-TX), the top-ranking Republican on the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary]], argued against its passage stating, "I cannot support legislation that might enable the violent and devastating crack cocaine epidemic of the past to become a clear and present danger."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.votesmart.org/speech_detail.php?sc_id=589007&amp;keyword=&amp;phrase=&amp;contain= "Project Vote Smart-Fair Sentencing Act of 2010"]. Votesmart.og, accessed December 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, Smith alleged that because "reducing the penalties for crack cocaine could expose our neighborhoods to the same violence and addiction that caused Congress to act in the first place,"&lt;ref name="articles.cnn.com"&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2010-07-28/politics/house.drug.penalties_1_cocaine-penalties-powder-cocaine-sentencing-disparity?_s=PM:POLITICS House Passes Bill to Reduce Disparity in Cocaine Penalties]. CNN.com, accessed December 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the bill risked a return to the crack cocaine epidemic that "ravaged our communities, especially minority communities."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkprogress.org/2010/07/29/cocaine-drug-sentencing/ Rep. Lamar Smith Says Reducing Racial Disparity In Crack Cocaine Sentencing Hurts Minorities]. thinkprogress.com, accessed December 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/30/lamar-smith-derides-reduc_n_665046.html Lamar Smith Derides Reduction Of Crack-Cocaine Sentencing Disparity As Damaging To Minorities]. huffingtonpost.com, accessed December 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith claimed that the severe sentences for crack cocaine were justified by a high correlation between crack cocaine arrests and both violent crime and past criminal history.&lt;ref name="articles.cnn.com"/&gt;

The [[Fraternal Order of Police]], a national organization of law enforcement officers, also opposed the Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fop.net/legislative/oppose.shtml Legislation Opposed by the National Fraternal Order of Police] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318015429/http://www.fop.net/legislative/oppose.shtml |date=2011-03-18 }}. Fraternal Order of Police website, accessed December 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  It argued that because increased violence is associated with the use of crack, especially in urban areas, high penalties for crack-related offenses were justified, relying on U.S. Sentencing Commission statistics showing that 29% of all crack cases from October 1, 2008, through September 30, 2009, involved a weapon, compared to only 16% for powder cocaine.  The organization also stated that the enhanced penalties for crack cocaine "have proven useful, and a better course of action would have been to instead raise the penalties for powder cocaine crimes."&lt;ref name=Datashow/&gt;  The Fair Sentencing Act includes a provision to account for such aggravated cases, allowing penalties to be increased for the use of violence during a drug trafficking offense.&lt;ref name=Datashow/&gt;

The [[National Sheriffs' Association]] (NSA) opposed the bill, stating that "Both crack and powder cocaine are dangerous narcotics and plights{{sic}} on communities throughout the United States. ...  NSA would consider supporting legislation that would increase the sentence for powder cocaine, rather than significantly reducing the sentence for crack cocaine."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sheriffs.org/userfiles/File/legislative%20issues/2010_NSA_Priorities_(1).pdf#xml=http://pr-dtsearch001.americaneagle.com/service/search.asp?cmd=pdfhits&amp;DocId=12553&amp;Index=F%3a%5cdtSearch%5csheriffs&amp;HitCount=21&amp;hits=10+18+24+26+28+ National Sheriff's Association, 2010 Legislative Priorities]. National Sheriff's Association, January 12, 2010, accessed December 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposal and passage of the bill==
[[File:Obama signing the Fair Sentencing Act.jpg|thumb|right|President [[Barack Obama]] at the signing ceremony for the Act.]]

On July 29, 2009, the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary]] passed proposed legislation, the Fairness in Cocaine Sentencing Act (H.R.3245), a bill sponsored by [[Bobby Scott (U.S. politician)|Bobby Scott]].  Co-sponsored by a group of 62 members of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], including [[Dennis Kucinich]] and [[Ron Paul]], the bill would have completely eliminated the sentencing disparity.&lt;ref name=Paulrelease&gt;"Ron Paul's Statement on the Fair Sentencing Act"&lt;/ref&gt;  The Fair Sentencing Act was introduced as compromise legislation to get bipartisan and unanimous support, amended to merely reduce the 100:1 disparity to 18:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.detnews.com/article/20100401/OPINION01/4010336/1008/OPINION01/Change-cocaine--crack-sentencing#ixzz0p0kFOAag|title=Change cocaine, crack sentencing|author=Bill Piper and Jasmine Tyler|date=April 1, 2010|work=[[The Detroit News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fair Sentencing Act (S. 1789) was authored by [[Assistant Senate Majority Leader]] Dick Durbin (D-IL) and cosponsored by [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]] Chairman [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-VT) and [[ranking member]] [[Jeff Sessions]] (R-AL).&lt;ref name=Durbinrelease/&gt;  The bill passed the [[U.S. Senate]] on March 17, 2010 and passed the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on July 27, 2010,&lt;ref name=famm/&gt; with House [[Majority Whip#United States|Majority Whip]] [[James E. Clyburn]] (D-SC) and [[Bobby Scott (U.S. politician)|Bobby Scott]] (D-VA) as key supporters.&lt;ref name=WashPost/&gt;  The bill was then sent to President Obama and signed into law on August 3, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s111-1789 S. 1789: Fair Sentencing Act of 2010], govtrack.us, accessed September 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key provisions==
The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 amended the [[Controlled Substances Act]] and the [[Controlled Substances Import and Export Act]] by increasing the amount of a controlled substance or mixture containing a cocaine base (i.e., crack cocaine) that would result in mandatory minimum prison terms for trafficking and by increasing monetary penalties for drug trafficking and for importing/exporting controlled substances.  The five-year mandatory minimum for first-time possession of crack cocaine was also eliminated,&lt;ref name=billsummary&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN01789:@@@D&amp;summ2=4&amp; Bill Summary &amp; Status - 111th Congress (2009–2010) - S.1789 - CRS Summary], thomas.loc.gov, accessed October 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and sentencing may take account of accompanying violence, among other aggravating factors.&lt;ref name=Datashow/&gt;

The bill directed the [[United States Sentencing Commission]] to take four actions:
*review and amend its sentencing guidelines to increase sentences for those convicted of committing violent acts in the course a drug trafficking offense;
*incorporate aggravating and mitigating factors in its guidelines for drug trafficking offenses;
*announce all guidelines, policy statements, and amendments required by the act no later than 90 days after its enactment; and
*study and report to Congress on the impact of changes in sentencing law under this act.

In addition, the bill requires the [[Comptroller General of the United States|Comptroller General]] to report to Congress with an analysis of the effectiveness of drug court programs under the [[Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968]].  This must be done within one year after the enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act.&lt;ref name=billsummary/&gt;

==Impact and reception==
The [[Congressional Budget Office]] has estimated that implementing the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 will reduce the prison population by 1,550 person-years over the time period from 2011–2015, creating a monetary savings of $42 million during that period.&lt;ref name=CBOestimate&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/114xx/doc11413/s1789.pdf Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate], cbo.gov, accessed September 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The CBO also estimates that the Act's requirement for the [[Government Accountability Office]] to conduct a report on the effectiveness of a [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] grant program to treat nonviolent drug offenders would cost less than $500,000 from appropriated funds.&lt;ref name=CBOestimate/&gt;

On October 15, 2010, the U.S. Sentencing Commission voted 6-1 to approve a temporary amendment to federal sentencing guidelines to reflect the changes made by the Fair Sentencing Act.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/15/AR2010101505263.html "Crack, powder cocaine sentence guidelines adjusted"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 15, 2010, accessed October 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission changed the sentencing guidelines to reflect Congress's increasing the amount of crack cocaine that would trigger a five-year mandatory minimum sentence from 5&amp;nbsp;grams to 28&amp;nbsp;grams (one ounce) and the amount that would trigger a ten-year mandatory minimum from 50&amp;nbsp;grams to 280&amp;nbsp;grams. The amendment also lists aggravating factors to the guidelines, creating harsher sentences for crack cocaine offenses involving violence or bribery of law enforcement officials. The Commission made the amendment permanent on June 30, 2011.&lt;ref name=Famm&gt;[http://www.famm.org/FederalSentencing/USSentencingGuidelines/USSentencingGuidelinesUpdates/USSentencingCommissionImplementsCrackLaw.aspx "US Sentencing Commission Implements Crack Law"], Families Against Mandatory Minimums, famm.org, accessed October 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective November 1, 2011, the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 applies retroactively to reduce the sentences of certain offenders already sentenced for federal crack cocaine offenses before the passage of the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/news/2011/06/us-sentencing-commission-votes-make-crackpowder-cocaine-sentencing-reforms-retroactive |title=U.S. Sentencing Commission Votes to Make Crack/Powder Cocaine Sentencing Reforms Retroactive |date=30 June 2011|accessdate=16 November 2012 |publisher=The Drug Policy Alliance |work=press release }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the nonprofit organization [[Families Against Mandatory Minimums]], a major advocate of the Fair Sentencing Act, has lobbied Congress to make the entire act retroactive.&lt;ref name=famm/&gt;  According to [[Gil Kerlikowske]], Director of the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]], "there is no scientific basis for the disparity and by promoting laws and policies that treat all Americans equally, and by working to amend or end those that do not, we can only increase public confidence in the criminal justice system and help create a safer and healthier nation for us all."&lt;ref name="Congress OKs Fair Sentencing Act"&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/07/28/Congress-OKs-Fair-Sentencing-Act/UPI-22641280367802/ "Congress OKs Fair Sentencing Act"]. ''[[United Press International]]'', July 28, 2010, accessed December 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Progressives argue for elimination of the sentencing disparity altogether and believe that the impact of the bill on racial disparities in drug enforcement may be limited for several reasons. First, while the bill reduces the ratio between crack and powder cocaine sentencing, it does not achieve full parity. Second, the Act does not address the enforcement prerogatives of federal criminal justice agencies: while African-American defendants account for roughly 80% of those arrested for crack-related offenses, public health data has found that two-thirds of crack users are white or Hispanic.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Antoine. [http://www.civilrights.org/archives/2010/07/1029-sentencing-disparity-vote.html "House Could Consider Legislation This Week to Reduce Crack and Cocaine Sentencing Disparity"], Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, civilrights.org, July 27, 2010, accessed December 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Third, the Act does not reduce sentences for those prosecuted under state law, and state prosecutions account for a vast majority of incarcerations for drug-related offenses.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, John.

'''Gertrude Mary Ansell''' (2 June 1861 – 7 March 1932) was a British [[suffragette]], animal rights activist and businesswoman.

==Life==
Ansell was the third child and only daughter of the metallurgist [[George Frederick Ansell]] (1826–1880) and his wife, Sarah (''née'' Cook). Her father had, in 1856, been appointed to a clerkship in the [[Royal Mint]] with a brief to eliminate waste and mismanagement but was forced to give up his position in 1868. He died in 1880 leaving his family little; in 1881 Gertrude Ansell was working in a telephone office. By 1900, she had set up in business as a "typewriter".&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Elizabeth Crawford, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/63818 "Ansell, Gertrude Mary (1861–1932)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004. Accessed 10 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Gertrude Ansell's thinking was dominated by the welfare of animals and the enfranchisement of women. In 1909, she became honorary treasurer of the [[Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society]] and one of the organisers of that year's International Anti-Vivisection and Animal Protection Congress. She believed that the economic position of women would never be satisfactory without political freedom and in December 1906 she joined the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU). On 13 October 1908, she was arrested after taking part in a WSPU "raid" on the [[House of Commons]] and was sentenced to one month's imprisonment in [[HM Prison Holloway|Holloway Prison]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

During the next five years, Ansell took part in all of the major WSPU spectacles, but she had given an undertaking to one of her animal committees not to take part in militant activity. She worked for the ''Dogs Exemption Bill'' and the ''Plumage Bill'', but when they were rejected by the House of Commons in 1913 she returned to WSPU actions. On 31 July, she smashed a window at the Home Office and was sentenced to a month's imprisonment. She went on hunger strike and was released under the "''[[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913|Cat and Mouse Act]]''". She was rearrested on 30 October at [[Holborn tube station]] while selling the WSPU's newspaper, ''The Suffragette''. The criminal record office had circulated her photograph and description as a "known militant suffragette" (5 feet 4 inches, grey eyes, hair turning grey). She then followed a pattern of hunger strike, release, rearrest and imprisonment until she managed to evade the police.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

On 12 May 1914, she smashed [[Hubert von Herkomer]]'s portrait of the [[Duke of Wellington]] in the [[Royal Academy]]&lt;ref&gt;Helena Bonett, [https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/deeds-not-words-suffragettes-and "‘Deeds not words’: Suffragettes and the Summer Exhibition"], Royal Academy web site, 2 May 2014.

Retrieved 12 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; When arrested, she was reported to have said, "I have done my duty, and I wish that every other woman would do the same." &lt;ref&gt;[https://newspaperarchive.com/uk/middlesex/london/london-standard/1914/05-13/page-11?tag=gertrude+mary+ansell+gertrude+mary+ansell&amp;rtserp=tags/?pep=gertrude-mary-ansell&amp;pf=gertrude-mary&amp;pl=ansell "Academy Scene.

She was finally released on 10 August, under an amnesty for suffragette prisoners at the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. She had been forcibly fed 236 times.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

One of her brothers was the [[barrister]] J. E. Ansell, who later published a history of the family name.&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Ansell, ''Ansell: History of the Name, 1086 to about 1600'', 1929; '' Ansell: History of the Name ... Completed'', 1933&lt;/ref&gt; It was to his children that Gertrude Ansell left her small estate. She died at the General Hospital in [[Saffron Walden]] on 7 March 1932 following an operation for gallstones.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1416">'''Green seniors''' refers to [[elderly]] or [[retired]] people who have an active interest in [[Environmentalism|environmental]] issues.

The term is believed to have first been publicly used by the [[European Green Party]] in the 2005 [http://huizekeytsman.telenet.be/ENGS/engs3.htm Declaration Of Brussels], and has been subsequently discussed by various Green Parties in [[Europe]] without wider uptake as a generic term.

The [[demographics]] of the modern [[environmental movement]] tend to be skewed towards younger people (sometimes referred to as "[[Generation Y]]"; with the exception of a smaller number of "elder statespersons" who were involved in the birth of the modern [[environmental movement]]. This is demonstrated clearly in the membership profiles of organisations such as [[Greenpeace]], [[Rainforest Action Network]] and [http://peopleandplanet.org/ People and Planet], who all classify themselves as [[Direct Action]] groups.

A website called [http://www.greenseniors.org Green Seniors] was launched in 2006 to attempt to give the term wider currency and provide a portal specifically for older people to access information and find environmental organisation and campaigns.

==History==
{{See also|History of Mexico}}

===First Mexican Empire (1822–1823)===
{{See also|First Mexican Empire}}
After [[First Mexican Empire|Mexico]] was [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire|declared and recognized as an independent state]], Iturbide was backed and influenced by Mexico's [[Conservatism|conservatives]], who favored an independent Mexico with a monarch from one of the European royal families as head of state. When no European royalty accepted Mexico's offer (as Spain still had hopes of taking Mexico back), Iturbide was persuaded by his advisers to be named ''Emperor'' in the manner of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]].&lt;ref name="Vazquez"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Dictionary of Mexican Rulers 1325-1997|last= Vazquez-Gomez |first= Juana |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1997 |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group, Incorporated,  |location= Westport, CT, USA |isbn=978-0-313-30049-3 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkwood"&gt;{{Cite book|title= History of Mexico |last=Kirkwood |first=Burton |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group, Incorporated |location= Westport, CT, USA |isbn= 978-0-313-30351-7 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alvaro"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Alvaro |last=Ibañez |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title= Mexico en sus Banderas/Bandera del Imperio de Iturbide|date =2005-02-12 |format= |agency=Notimex |work= |publisher=Reforma |location=Mexico City |id= |language=Spanish |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May 1823, the ex-emperor boarded the [[England|English]] ship ''Rawlins'', en route to [[Livorno]], [[Italy]] (then part of the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]],&lt;ref name="Hamue"/&gt; accompanied by his wife, children and some servants. There, he rented a small country house and began to write his memoirs. However, Spain pressured Tuscany to expel Iturbide, which it did, and the Iturbide family moved to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="casaimperial"/&gt; There, he published his autobiography, "Statement of Some of the Principal Events in the Public Life of Agustín de Iturbide". When he was exiled, Iturbide was given a government pension, but Congress also declared him a traitor and "outside of the law", to be killed if he ever returned to Mexico. Whether he was aware of this second part is in dispute.&lt;ref name="Hamue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raggett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkwood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manfut"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.manfut.org/cronologia/iturbide.html |title= Coleccion de Documentos Historicos – Don  Agustin de Iturbide |last=Manfut |first=Eduardo P. |language=Spanish|accessdate= 2008-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his departure, the situation in Mexico continued to worsen. Reports of a probable Spanish attempt to retake Mexico reached Iturbide in the UK.&lt;ref name="Raggett"/&gt; He continued to receive reports from Mexico, as well as advice from supporters, that if he returned, he would be hailed as a liberator and a potential leader against the Spanish invasion.&lt;ref name="Raggett"/&gt; Iturbide sent word to [[Congress of Mexico|congress]] in Mexico City on 13 February 1824 offering his services in the event of a Spanish attack. Congress never replied.&lt;ref name="manfut"/&gt; More conservative political factions in Mexico finally convinced Iturbide to return."&lt;ref name="elbalero"/&gt;

Iturbide returned to Mexico on 14 July 1824,&lt;ref name="Kirkwood"/&gt; accompanied by his wife, two children, and a [[chaplain]].&lt;ref name="manfut"/&gt; He landed at the port of [[Soto la Marina]] on the coast of Nuevo Santander (the modern-day state of [[Tamaulipas]]). They were initially greeted enthusiastically, but soon they were arrested and escorted by General Felipe de la Garza, the local military commander, to the nearby village of [[Padilla (municipality)|Padilla]].&lt;ref name="Rosainz"/&gt; The local legislature held a trial and sentenced Iturbide to death. When a local priest administered last rites, Iturbide supposedly said, "Mexicans! I die with honor, not as a traitor; do not leave this stain on my children and my legacy. I am not a traitor, no." He was executed by [[firing squad]] on 19 July 1824.&lt;ref name="elbalero"/&gt;

'''Indian Mexicans''' are [[Mexico|Mexican]] citizens who are descendants of migrants from [[India]]. Indians are a minor, but increasing, group in Mexico and are particularly active in the country's tech industry.

==Overview==
The first Indians arrived in Mexico during the [[New Spain|colonial era]]. During this period, thousands of Asians arrived via the [[Manila galleons]], some of them as slaves termed "chinos" or "indios chinos" (literally Chinese, regardless of actual ethnicity). The first record of an Asian in Mexico is from 1540; an enslaved cook originating from [[Calicut]].&lt;ref name="Oropeza"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oropeza Keresey|first1=Déborah|title=La esclavitud asiática en el virreinato de la Nueva España, 1565-1673|url=http://historiamexicana.colmex.mx/index.php/RHM/article/viewFile/278/255|publisher=Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best known "china" was [[Catarina de San Juan]], a girl captured by Portuguese slave traders in [[Cochin]].

In 1923, immigration of ethnic Indians was secretly prohibited.&lt;ref name=FitzGerald&gt;{{cite book|last1=FitzGerald|first1=David Scott|last2=Cook-Martín|first2=David|title=Culling the Masses|date=2014|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674729048|page=220|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wXWWAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=Culling+the+Masses+Mexico+table+6.1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJzJvy0eDJAhUD6SYKHZ6dAHAQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Culling%20the%20Masses%20Mexico%20table%206.1&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was kept confidential in order to avoid diplomatic problems with the [[British Empire]]. This ban, along with similar bans based on ethnicity, was eliminated by a 1947 law that prohibited racial discrimination.&lt;ref name=FitzGerald/&gt;

Most of the Indians in Mexico are recent arrivals in the country and almost all of them have settled in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rajput |first=Gopichand |url=http://pakistanhindupost.blogspot.com/2009/12/hinduism-in-mexico.html |title=Pakistan Hindu Post (PHP): Hinduism in Mexico |publisher=Pakistanhindupost.blogspot.com |date=21 December 2009 |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=July 2017}} Mexico has a [[jus soli|non-discriminatory policy]] with regard to the grant of its citizenship. The spouse of a Mexican national would generally not face any problem in acquiring local citizenship. Although a few of the [[Non-resident Indian|NRI]]s have married Mexicans, they have retained their Indian citizenship.

The Indians in this country are mainly businessmen or professionals. Many of them work with one or other international organization or a multinational corporation. There are also some academicians and scientists among them. They have helped to bring about greater mutual understanding between India and their host country. Some of the Indians work for "ISPAT Mexicana" which is part of the [[Laxmi Mittal]] group, well known in this region for having turned around a sinking steel company in [[Trinidad]]. The Indian presence in Mexico has been greatly appreciated as fifty other business ventures have invested around US$1.58 billion in the country around 1994 to 2000.

According to the [[Indian Ministry of External Affairs]], there were about 2,000 Indians living in Mexico as of March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mea.gov.in/mystart.php?id=50049865 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721044421/http://mea.gov.in/mystart.php?id=50049865 | archivedate = 21 July 2011 | title = India-Mexico Relations | publisher = Indian Ministry of External Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian culture in Mexico==
The main Indian community organisation is the Indian Women's Association of Mexico (IWAM)in Mexico City. It celebrates important festivals and organises cultural programmes. A [[Sai Baba of Shirdi|Sai Baba]] temple, a [[Vaishnav]] temple, and a [[Gurudwara]] have also been constructed by Sangam Organisation in Mexico City.

==Notable individuals==
* [[Manabendra Nath Roy]] – Founder of the [[Mexican Communist Party]]
* [[Rajagopal (professor and researcher)]] – expert in business and marketing at [[Tec de Monterrey]]
* [[Sanjaya Rajaram]] – [[Agronomist]]; creator of 480 types of [[wheat]]
* [[Pandurang Sadashiv Khankhoje]] – One of the founding fathers of the [[Ghadar Party]]
* [[Catarina de San Juan]] (Mirra) – Girl brought to colonial Mexico as a slave; the "[[China Poblana]]"

==Usage==
An internaut is online savvy, typically through years of online experience, with a thorough knowledge of how to use search engines, Internet resources, forums, newsgroups and chat rooms to find information. The more someone knows about the Internet, its history and politics, the more likely the term ''internaut'' fits them. The less he or she knows the more likely a different term would be more fitting. Other terms roughly analogous with internaut are ''[[cybernaut]]'' and ''[[netizen]]'', though each has its own connotation. The common thread among them in English is an implication of experience and knowledge of the Internet or cyberspace that goes beyond the casual user. The French, however, use the term to describe any Internet user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=English translation of 'internaute'|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/internaute|website=Collins Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reformation in Kerala}}

'''Kallumala Samaram''' (Stone Necklace Protest) is an agitation or social revolution by [[Pulayar]] community that took place at [[Perinad]] and nearby villages such as Cherumoodu, [[Kanjavely]] etc. in, [[Kollam district]] on October 24, 1915.

The agitation is also known as [[Perinad]] Lahala or [[Perinad]] Mutiny. It enjoys a significant position in Kerala history.

== History ==
The agitation was a sudden uprising against the upper class's dictum to the minority castes to not use the public road, denying the right to education, prohibiting entry to temples and denying women to wear gold or metal ornaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/Communist-Party-of-India-revives-Perinad-Lahala-memories-to-fight-extremism/articleshow/54670958.cms|title=Communist Party of India revives Perinad Lahala memories to fight extremism - Times of India|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agitation intensified by December-end and a meeting was convened under the chair of [[Ayyankali]] on December 21, 1915 at Plavilapurayidom, Cherumoodu, near [[Perinad]] where women belonging to Pulaya community threw away the ''Kallumala'' (ornaments made out of stone and woods) and proclaimed that they will only use gold or metal ornaments. Kallumala's were chains of beads worn by their ladies as a symbol of slavery and inferior caste status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socialscienceijksubdist.blogspot.in/2010/01/kallumala-samaram.html|title=kallumala samaram|website=socialscienceijksubdist.blogspot.in|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this agitation the oppressed class fought the caste elites by breaking their chains to win the right to wear ornaments.

During pre-independence era women from lower castes in Kerala faced severe unfathomable oppression. There were strict diktats regarding dress codes and ornaments and there was even taxes to be paid to erstwhile [[Travancore]] kings for covering their breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/200-years-on-nangelis-sacrifice-only-a-fading-memory/article5256145.ece|title=200 years on, Nangeli's sacrifice only a fading memory|last=Surendranath|first=Nidhi|date=2013-10-21|newspaper=The Hindu|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Koreans in Paraguay''' formed one of the earliest [[Korean diaspora]] communities in [[Latin America]]. However, they were always overshadowed by the larger Korean communities in neighbouring [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]], and since the late 1990s, their population has fallen significantly.&lt;ref name="Lesser"&gt;{{citation|last=Lesser|first=Jeffrey|chapter=Asians in South America|url=http://www.everyculture.com/South-America/Asians-in-South-America.html|title=Countries and their Cultures|editor1-last=Ember|editor1-first=Melvin|editor2-last=Ember|editor2-first=Carol R.|publisher=Macmillan Library Reference|date=23 May 2001|isbn=978-0-02-864950-4|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OKF"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.okf.or.kr/data/status_SA.jsp|title={{asiantitle|재외동포현황 - 중남미||Status of overseas compatriots - Central/South America|a}}|publisher=Overseas Korean Foundation|date=2005|accessdate=2008-09-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414101829/http://www.okf.or.kr/data/status_SA.jsp|archivedate=2009-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration history==
The first Korean immigrants to Paraguay came from [[Busan]] on a two-month journey by sea to [[Buenos Aires]] and then overland to [[Asunción]], finally arriving on 22 April 1965.&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;{{citation|last=Park|first=Chae-soon|chapter=La emigración coreana en América Latina y sus perspectivas|title=Segundo Congreso del Consejo de Estudios Latinoamericanos de Asia y de Oceania|publisher=Latin American Studies Association of Korea|publication-place=Seoul|date=2007|url=http://www.lasak.or.kr/CELAOfiles/papers/Session3/Park%20Chae%20Soon%5BSession3-2%5D.pdf|accessdate=2008-09-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217010906/http://www.lasak.or.kr/CELAOfiles/papers/Session3/Park%20Chae%20Soon%5BSession3-2%5D.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.abc.com.py/2004-10-03/articulos/137351/piden-a-nuestro-pais-eliminar-visas|periodical=ABC Digital|publication-place=Paraguay|title=Piden a nuestro país eliminar visas|date=3 October 2004|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exact numbers of migrants are difficult to calculate because Paraguay offered on-the-spot visas to all foreigners, and did not distinguish between those who came to settle in the country as opposed to those who intended to remain only temporarily; 120,000 Koreans arrived in Paraguay between 1975 and 1990, according to official figures, but many migrated onwards to Brazil, both legally and [[illegal immigration|illegally]].&lt;ref name="Lesser"/&gt; Paraguay's 1982 census showed 2,700 Koreans in Paraguay, but this was believed to have undercounted the actual population by as much as an order of magnitude.&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;{{citation|date=December 1988|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+py0047)|chapter=Immigrants|title=Country Study: Paraguay|publisher=Library of Congress|publication-place=United States of America|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1999, [[South Korea]]'s [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (South Korea)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] estimated that 10,428 Koreans resided in the country, but by just two years later, that figure fell by more than 40% to 6,190.&lt;ref name="OKF"/&gt;

The population continued to decline after that, though less sharply; {{asof|2009|lc=on}}, Koreans in Paraguay had fallen to the fifth-largest group of Koreans in Latin America, and 24th largest in the world.&lt;ref name="MOFAT2009"&gt;{{citation|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade |publication-place=South Korea |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-05-21 |url=http://www.mofat.go.kr/consul/overseascitizen/compatriotcondition/index6.jsp?TabMenu=TabMenu6 |title={{asiantitle|재외동포현황||Current Status of Overseas Compatriots|a}} |ref=CITEREFMOFAT2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023213104/http://www.mofat.go.kr/consul/overseascitizen/compatriotcondition/index6.jsp?TabMenu=TabMenu6 |archivedate=2010-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2009 and 2011, the population remained roughly stable. Of the 5,205 South Korean nationals or former nationals in Paraguay in 2011, 499 had become [[Paraguayan nationality law|Paraguayan nationals]], the vast majority (4,641 persons) had permanent residency, 16 were [[international student]]s, and 49 had other kinds of visas.&lt;ref name="MOFAT2011"/&gt;

==Business and employment==
The early Korean migrants who settled in Paraguay engaged in a variety of agricultural and commercial work, including [[beekeeping]] and [[door-to-door]] sales of imported clothing.&lt;ref name="Espinola"/&gt; By the early 1980s, many were involved in importing consumer electronics as well.&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt; Some also opened [[convenience store]]s in poorer neighbourhoods; they gained attention for remaining open through the [[siesta]], unlike many of their competitors.&lt;ref name="Espinola"/&gt; The second generation have largely moved away from manual labour or small retail business, and entered into the liberal professions, such as medicine, law, pharmacy, architecture, and accountancy.&lt;ref name="Park"/&gt;

==Language and education==
Koreans in Paraguay opened their own school in 1972, the [[Colegio Coreano del Paraguay]] (파라과이한국학교), to provide cultural and language education to their youth.&lt;ref name="Park"/&gt; It is located in the [[San Vicente (Asunción)|San Vicente]] neighbourhood of Asunción.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=ABC|url=http://archivo.abc.com.py/2004-07-03/articulos/119921/encuentro-infantil-de-danzas-espanolas-en-colegio-coreano|date=2004-07-03|accessdate=2011-03-13|title=Encuentro infantil de danzas españolas en colegio coreano}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Korean American]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church opened another school, the Colegio Presbiteriano Cerritos, in [[Villa Elisa (Paraguay)|Villa Elisa]] (in the Asunción metropolitan area) in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.abc.com.py/nota/atracan-una-escuela-a-50-metros-de-comisaria/|title=Atracan una escuela a 50 metros de comisaría|periodical=ABC|first=Higinio|last=Ruiz Díaz|date=2011-03-05|accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cerritos.edu.py/somos.html|title=Quienes somos|publisher=Colegio Presbiteriano Cerritos|accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little [[language shift]] is observed from Korean-dominance to Spanish-dominance among members of the Korean community in Paraguay, including those born locally; this contrasts sharply with the rapid shift from Korean-dominance to English-dominance among [[Korean American]]s, especially of the second generation.&lt;ref name="Choi"/&gt; Many Koreans in Paraguay send their children to study in universities in the United States and Europe; as of 2007, there were also roughly 100 Paraguay-born Koreans studying at universities in [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="Park"/&gt; They typically view English, rather than Spanish, as the most prestigious and economically important language to learn.&lt;ref name="Choi"/&gt;

==Religion==
Korean Christian missionaries are active among indigenous communities in [[Alto Paraná]] department.&lt;ref name="ABC20101223"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.abc.com.py/nota/coreanos-entregaron-viveres-a-los-indigenas/|periodical=ABC|title=Coreanos entregaron víveres a los indígenas|date=2010-12-23|accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korean churches in Ciudad del Este include Jardín del Dios and Iglesia de la Asamblea de Dios.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Religiosos coreanos prohíben estacionar vehículos frente a su iglesia|periodical=Diario CDE|date=2011-01-07|accessdate=2011-03-13|url=http://www.diariocde.com.py/v3/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1544:religiosos-coreanos-prohiben-estacionar-vehiculos-frente-a-su-iglesia&amp;catid=36:tennis&amp;Itemid=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.abc.com.py/nota/iglesia-coreana-dona-equipos/|periodical=ABC|title=Iglesia coreana dona equipos|date=2011-02-26|accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kurds in Finland''' refers to [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] living in [[Finland]]. In 2017 there were 13,327 [[Kurdish language|Kurdish speakers]] in Finland&lt;ref name="Tilasto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kieli iän ja sukupuolen mukaan maakunnittain 1990 - 2017|url=http://pxnet2.stat.fi/PXWeb/pxweb/fi/StatFin/StatFin__vrm__vaerak/statfin_vaerak_pxt_031.px/?rxid=2362652d-c9b9-42f2-8a0b-95ac5bef4fec|publisher=Tilastokeskus|accessdate=30 August 2017|ref=Tilasto}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the number of ethnic Kurds is probably higher.

==History==
Some of the Finnish Kurds originate from [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]], but most of them have come from [[Iraq]], where they started arriving from in the 1990s as [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] quota refugees. Kurds make up the majority of Iraqi immigrants to Finland.&lt;ref name="EOD"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Diasporas - Volume II|date=2005|publisher=Springer|isbn= 0306483211|pages=1004–1010|ref=EOD}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] gained ground against the [[Peshmerga]] in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] the Finnish Kurds organized protests against ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hjelt|first1=Yrjö|title=Suomen kurdit osoittavat mieltään terroristijärjestö Isisiä vastaan|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/suomen_kurdit_osoittavat_mieltaan_terroristijarjesto_isisia_vastaan/7429730|publisher=Yle Uutiset|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the chairman of Finnish-Kurdish friendship association several dozens of Finnish Kurds had left to Syria and Iraq in order to fight against ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ijäs|first1=Johannes|title=Arvio: Jopa kymmeniä lähtenyt Suomesta kurditaistelijoiden riveihin|url=http://www.kotimaa24.fi/artikkeli/arvio-jopa-kymmenia-lahtenyt-suomesta-kurditaistelijoiden-riveihin/|website=Kotimaa24|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Finnish Kurds speak several different dialects of Kurdish, the largest of which are [[Sorani Kurdish|Sorani]] and [[Kurmanji Kurdish]]. Kurmanji has more speakers worldwide, but Sorani is the most spoken Kurdish dialect in Finland. It is likelly that there are more ethnic Kurds than there are those who speak it as a first language. For example, some of the Kurds who originate from Turkey speak [[Turkish language|Turkish]] rather than Kurdish. There are several different Kurdish organizations in Finland, many of which have direct or undirect connections to political parties in Iraqi Kurdistan.&lt;ref name="EOD"/&gt;

Almost all Finnish Kurds are Muslim and in the Iraqi Kurdistan, where the most Finnish Kurds hail from, most Kurds are [[Sunni islam|Sunni Muslim]]. Kurds are not however usually very active in religious life, since many of them have leftist and secular political background.&lt;ref name="EOD"/&gt;

This is a '''list of graphic art works with LGBT characters'''. This list includes [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] fictional characters in comic series, newspaper strips, [[graphic novel]]s, and [[manga]].

==History==
In the 1950s, American comic books, under the [[Comics Code Authority]], adopted the Comic Code which, under the  guise of preventing "perversion", largely prevented the presentation of LGBT characters for a number of decades.&lt;ref name="Booker2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Booker|first=M.

Within the Japanese anime and manga, ''[[yaoi]]'' is the tradition of representing same-sex male relationships in materials that are generally created by women artists and marketed mostly for Japanese girls &lt;ref name="Publishing2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Publishing|first=Here|title=The Advocate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RGUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA86|accessdate=1 January 2015|date=2003-10-14|publisher=Here Publishing|pages=86–}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the genre known as ''[[Yuri (genre)|yuri]]'' focuses on relationships between women.

Chizuru constantly uses this as an excuse to attempt to be intimate with Azumi, such as inviting her to hug and kiss for the purpose of rehearsing the film.  Though Azumi tends to be uncomfortable with her advances and often gets away from her without doing what she wants, Azumi eventually becomes aware of her feelings and reciprocates them.

==Classification and related languages==
The modern Macedonian language belongs to the [[East South Slavic languages|eastern group]] of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] branch of [[Slavic languages]] in the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family, together with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and the extinct [[Old Church Slavonic]]. Macedonian's closest relative is Bulgarian,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Levinson|O'Leary|1992|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; with which it has a high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]].&lt;ref name="ucla"/&gt; The next closest relative is [[Serbo-Croatian]]. [[Language contact]] between Macedonian and Serbo-Croatian reached its height during Yugoslav times, when most Macedonians learned Serbo-Croatian as a compulsory language of education and knew and used Serbian (or "pseudo-Serbian", i.e. a mixture of Serbian and Macedonian).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=vi_VCm51kpkC |page=515 }} |title=Languages and Linguistics of Europe: A Comprehensive Guide|first=Bernd|last= Kortmann|first2= Johan |last2=van der Auwera| page= 420 |publisher= |date=2011-07-27 |accessdate=2014-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been also claims, that Macedonian was intentionally [[Serbianization|Serbianized]] first during the process of its standardization.&lt;ref&gt;The Implementation of Standard Macedonian: Problems and Results Victor A.

According to Olga Mišeska–Tomić:

{{bquote|Macedonian is structurally related to Bulgarian more than to any other South Slavic language. But the core of its standard was not formed out of dialects or variants that had ever been covered by the Bulgarian standard. Consequently, its autonomy could not have resulted from a conscious distancing of a variant of a pluricentric language. Like the other South Slavic standards, the Macedonian standard was based on dialects which had never before been covered by a standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The population of the [[Republic of Macedonia]] was 2,022,547 in 2002, with 1,644,815 speaking Macedonian as their native language.&lt;ref name="census"&gt;Popis na Naselenie, Domaćinstva i Stanovi vo Republika Makedonija, 2002 – Vkupno naselenie na Republika Makedonija spored majčin jazik.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the Republic, there are Macedonians living in other parts of the [[Macedonia (region)|geographical area of Macedonia]]. There are [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonian]] minorities in neighbouring [[Albania]], in [[Bulgaria]], in [[Greece]], and in [[Serbia]]. According to the official Albanian census of 1989, 4,697 ethnic Macedonians reside in Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Artan|Gurraj|2001|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of Macedonians live outside the traditional Balkan [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonian region]], with [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] having the largest emigrant communities. According to a 1964 estimate, approximately 580,000 Macedonians live outside the Macedonian Republic,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Topolinjska|1998|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly 30% of the total population. The Macedonian language has the status of official language only in the Republic of Macedonia, and is a recognized minority and official language in parts of [[Albania]] ([[Pustec]]),{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} [[Romania]], and [[Serbia]] ([[Jabuka]] and [[Plandište]]). There are provisions for learning the Macedonian language in Romania as Macedonians are an officially recognized minority group. Macedonian is taught in some universities in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Croatia]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and other countries.

Most of the language speakers in Greece do not identify ethnically as "Macedonians", but as ethnic Greeks (''[[Slavophone Greeks]]'') or ''dopii'' (locals).

===Relationship to Bulgarian===
{{See also|Bulgarian language|Bulgarian dialects}}

The historical and linguistic relationships between the Macedonian and Bulgarian languages are special and complicated. Macedonian researchers claim Macedonian is spoken in southwestern Bulgaria, whereas Bulgarian and Greek linguists argue Macedonian is a variety of Bulgarian.

The [[rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]] began to degrade its specific social system, and especially the so-called [[Rum millet]], through constant identification of the religious creed with ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=htMUx8qlWCMC |page=47 }} |title=Europe and the Historical Legacies in the Balkans|first= Raymond|last= Detrez|first2=Barbara|last2= Segaert|first3=Peter |last3=Lang|isbn=90-5201-374-8|pages=36–38 |publisher= |date=2008 |accessdate=2014-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national awakening of each ethnic group was complex and most of the groups interacted with each other.

During the [[Bulgarian national revival]], which occurred in the first half of the 19th century, the Bulgarian and Macedonian Slavs under the supremacy of the Greek Orthodox clergy wanted to create [[Bulgarian Exarchate|their own Church]] and schools which would use a common modern "Macedono-Bulgarian" literary standard, called simply ''Bulgarian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=1jSg3lxgSy8C |page=134 }} |title=Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia Historical Dictionaries of Europe|first= Dimitar|last= Bechev|publisher= Scarecrow Press|isbn=0-8108-6295-6|page=134|date=2009-04-13 |accessdate=2014-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national elites active in this movement used mainly ethnolinguistic principles to differentiation between "Slavic-Bulgarian" and "Greek" groups.&lt;ref&gt;From Rum Millet to Greek and Bulgarian Nations: Religious and National Debates in the Borderlands of the Ottoman Empire, 1870–1913. Theodora Dragostinova, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, every ethnographic subgroup in the Macedonian-Bulgarian linguistic area wrote in their own local dialect and choosing a "base dialect" for the new standard was not an issue. Subsequently, during the 1850s and 1860s a long discussion was held in the Bulgarian periodicals about the need for a dialectal group (eastern, western or compromise) upon which to base the new standard and which dialect that should be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inslav.ru/images/stories/pdf/1990_Venediktov_%20Bolgarskij_literaturnyj_jazyk_epoxi_Vozrozhdenija.pdf |title=Венедиктов Г.

In 1878, a distinct Bulgarian state was established. The new state did not include the region of Macedonia which remained outside its borders in the frame of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. As a consequence, the idea of a common compromise standard was rejected by the Bulgarian codifiers during the 1880s and the eastern [[Bulgarian dialects]] were chosen as a basis for standard Bulgarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=wawGFWNuHiwC |page=440 }} |title=Pluricentric languages: differing norms in different nations|editor-first= Michael G. |editor-last=Clyne|publisher=Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co.|isbn=3110128551| page=440 |date= 1992|accessdate=2014-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Macedonian Bulgarians|Macedono-Bulgarian]] writers and organizations who continued to seek greater representation of Macedonian dialects in the Bulgarian standard were deemed separatists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.uchicago.edu/~vfriedm/Articles/003Friedman75.pdf "Macedonian Language and Nationalism During the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries"], Victor Friedman, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |plainurl= |id=I9p_m7oXQ00C |page=145 |title=Nationalism, Globalization, and Orthodoxy: The Social Origins of Ethnic Conflict in the Balkans}}, Victor Roudometof, Roland Robertson, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Though Loza adhered to the Bulgarian position on the issue of the Macedonian Slavs' ethnicity, it also favored revising the Bulgarian orthography by bringing it closer to the dialects spoken in Macedonia."

In 1892, the latter began publishing the review Loza [The Vine], which promoted certain characteristics of Macedonian dialects. At the same time, the activists, called ‘Lozars’ after the name of their review, ‘purified’ the Bulgarian orthography from some rudiments of the Church Slavonic. They expressed likewise a kind of Macedonian patriotism attested already by the first issue of the review: its materials greatly emphasized identification with Macedonia as a genuine ‘fatherland’. In any case, it is hardly surprising that the Lozars demonstrated both Bulgarian and Macedonian loyalty: what is more interesting is namely the fact that their Bulgarian nationalism was somehow harmonized with a Macedonian self-identification that was not only a political one but also demonstrated certain ‘cultural’ contents.

During the World wars Bulgaria's short annexations over Macedonia saw two attempts to bring the Macedonian dialects back towards Bulgarian. This political situation stimulated the necessity of a separate Macedonian language and led gradually to its codification after the Second World War. It followed the establishment of [[SR Macedonia]], as part of Communist Yugoslavia and finalized the
progressive split in the common Macedonian–Bulgarian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=MlXQ5zKb_VQC |page=23 }} |title=Language, discourse and borders in the Yugoslav successor states – Current issues in language and society monographs, Birgitta Busch, Helen Kelly-Holmes, Multilingual Matters, 2004, ISBN 1-85359-732-5, pp. 24–25. |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2014-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first half of the 20th century the national identity of the Macedonian Slavs shifted from predominantly Bulgarian to ethnic Macedonian and their regional identity had become their national one.&lt;ref&gt;"Up until the early 20th century and beyond, the international community viewed Macedonians as a regional variety of Bulgarians, i.e. Western Bulgarians." {{Google books |plainurl= |id=-7TgkO8utHIC |title=Nationalism and Territory: Constructing Group Identity in Southeastern Europe, Geographical perspectives on the human past : Europe: Current Events, George W.

They imagined a Macedonian community uniting themselves with non-Slavic Macedonians... Most of these Macedonian Slavs also saw themselves as Bulgarians. By the middle of the 20th. century, however Macedonian patriots began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive.

Afterwards, Macedonian became the official language in the new republic, Serbo-Croatian was adopted as a second official language, and Bulgarian was proscribed. Moreover, in 1946–1948 the newly standardized Macedonian language was introduced as a second language even in Southwestern Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |plainurl= |id=dVRFMPV02UMC |page=260 |title=Performing Democracy: Bulgarian Music and Musicians in Transition, Donna A.

The total number of Macedonian speakers is highly disputed. Although the precise number of speakers is unknown, figures of between 1.6 million (from [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=mkd Ethnologue]) and 2–2.5 million have been cited; see {{Harvcoltxt|Topolinjska|1998}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Friedman|1985}}. The general academic consensus{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} is that there are approximately 2 million speakers of the Macedonian language, accepting that "it is difficult to determine the total number of speakers of Macedonian due to the official policies of the neighbouring Balkan states and the fluid nature of emigration" {{Harvcoltxt|Friedman|1985|p=?}}. According to the censuses and figures, the number of speakers of Macedonian is:

Based on a large group of features, Macedonian dialects can be divided into Eastern and Western groups (the boundary runs approximately from [[Skopje]] and [[Skopska Crna Gora]] along the rivers [[Vardar]] and Crna). In addition, a more detailed classification can be based on the modern reflexes of the [[Proto-Slavic]] reduced vowels ([[yer]]s), vocalic sonorants, and the back nasal *ǫ. That classification distinguishes between the following 5 groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western Dialects:
* '''Ohrid-Prespa Group'''
** [[Ohrid dialect]]
** [[Struga dialect]]
** [[Vevčani-Radožda dialect]]
** [[Upper Prespa dialect]]
** [[Lower Prespa dialect]].
* '''Debar Group'''
** [[Debar dialect]]
** [[Reka dialect]]
** [[Drimkol-Golo Brdo dialect]]
** [[Galičnik dialect]]
** [[Skopska Crna Gora dialect]]
** [[Našinski|Gora dialect]]
* '''Polog Group'''
** [[Upper Polog dialect]]
** [[Lower Polog dialect]]
** [[Prilep-Bitola dialect]]
** [[Kičevo-Poreče dialect]]
** [[Skopje-Veles dialect]]
* '''Kostur-Korča Group'''
** [[Korča dialect]]
** [[Kostur dialect]]
** [[Nestram-Kostenar dialect]]

Eastern Dialects:
* '''Northern Group'''
** [[Kumanovo dialect]]
** [[Kratovo dialect]]
** [[Kriva Palanka dialect]]
** [[Ovče Pole dialect]]
* '''Eastern Group'''
** [[Štip - Kočani dialect]]
** [[Strumica dialect]]
** [[Tikveš-Mariovo dialect]]
** [[Maleševo-Pirin dialect]]
** [[Solun-Voden dialect]]
** [[Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect]].

The [[Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect]] and [[Maleševo-Pirin dialect]] are also considered [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] dialects.&lt;ref name="Stoykov"/&gt;

==Phonology==
This discusses the '''[[phonology|phonological]] system of Standard Macedonian''' (unless otherwise noted) based on the [[Prilep-Bitola dialect]]. For discussion of other dialects, see [[Dialects of the Macedonian language|Macedonian dialects]]. Macedonian possesses five [[vowels]], one [[semivowel]], three [[liquid consonants]], three [[nasal stops]], three pairs of [[fricative consonant|fricative]]s, two pairs of [[affricate]]s, a non-paired voiceless fricative, nine pairs of voiced and unvoiced consonants and four pairs of [[Stop consonant|stops]].

===Vowels===

'''Schwa'''&lt;br /&gt;
The [[schwa]] is phonemic in many dialects (varying in closeness to {{IPAblink|ʌ}} or {{IPAblink|ɨ}}) but its use in the standard language is marginal.&lt;ref name="Friedman 2001 10"/&gt; When writing a dialectal word and keeping the schwa for aesthetic effect, an [[apostrophe]] is used; for example, {{angbr|к’смет}}, {{angbr|с’нце}}, etc. When spelling aloud, each consonant is followed by the schwa. The individual letters of [[acronyms]] are pronounced with the schwa in the same way: {{angbr|[[Macedonian Orthodox Church|МПЦ]]}} ({{IPA|[mə.pə.t͡sə]}}). The lexicalized acronyms {{angbr|[[USSR|СССР]]}} ({{IPA|[ɛs.ɛs.ɛs.ɛr]}}) and {{angbr|МТ}} ({{IPA|[ɛm.tɛ]}}) (a brand of cigarettes), are among the few exceptions.

'''Vowel length'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Vowel length]] is not phonemic. Vowels in stressed open syllables in disyllablic words with stress on the penult can be realized as long, e.g. {{angbr|Велес}} {{IPA-mk|ˈvɛːlɛs||Mk-Veles.ogg}} '[[Veles (city)|Veles]]'. The sequence {{IPA|/aa/}} is often realized phonetically as {{IPA|[aː]}}; e.g. {{angbr|саат}} {{IPA|/saat/}} {{IPA|[saːt]}} '''colloq.'' hour'.

{{note|1|1}} The alveolar trill ({{IPA|/r/}}) is [[Syllabic consonant|syllabic]] between two consonants; for example, {{angbr|прст}} {{IPA|[ˈpr̩st]}} 'finger'. The dental nasal ({{IPA|/n/}}) and dental lateral ({{IPA|/ɫ/}}) are also syllabic in certain foreign words; e.g. {{angbr|њутн}} {{IPA|[ˈɲutn̩]}} '[[Newton (unit)|newton]]', {{angbr|Попокатепетл}} {{IPA|[pɔpɔkaˈtɛpɛtɫ̩]}} '[[Popocatépetl]]', etc.

The [[labiodental nasal]] {{IPA|[ɱ]}} occurs as an allophone of {{IPA|/m/}} before {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} (e.g. {{angbr|трамвај}} {{IPA|[ˈtraɱvaj]}} '[[tram]]'). The [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[ŋ]}} similarly occur as an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} before {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} (e.g. {{angbr|англиски}} {{IPA|[ˈaŋɡliski]}} 'English'). The latter realization is avoided by some speakers who strive for a clear, formal pronunciation.

===Phonological processes===
At morpheme boundaries (represented in spelling) and at the end of a word (not represented in spelling), voicing opposition is [[Final-obstruent devoicing|neutralized]].

===Stress===
The [[word stress]] in Macedonian is [[wikt:antepenultimate|antepenultimate]], meaning it falls on the third from last [[syllable]] in words with three or more syllables, and on the first or only syllable in other words. This is sometimes disregarded when the word has entered the language more recently or from a foreign source. The following rules apply:
* [[Disyllabic]] words are stressed on the second-to-last syllable.

For example, {{angbr|дете}} {{IPA|[ˈdɛtɛ]}} 'child', {{angbr|мајка}} {{IPA|[ˈmajka]}} 'mother' and {{angbr|татко}} {{IPA|[ˈtatkɔ]}} 'father'.
* [[Trisyllabic]] and [[polysyllabic]] words are stressed on the third-to-last syllable.

For example, {{angbr|планина}} {{IPA|[ˈpɫanina]}} 'mountain', {{angbr|планината}} {{IPA|[pɫaˈninata]}} 'the mountain' and {{angbr|планинарите}} {{IPA|[pɫaniˈnaritɛ]}} 'the mountaineers'.

Exceptions include:
* [[Participle|Verbal adverbs]] (i.e. words suffixed with {{angbr|-ќи}}): e.g. {{angbr|викајќи}} {{IPA|[viˈkajci]}} 'shouting', {{angbr|одејќи}} {{IPA|[ɔˈdɛjci]}} 'walking'.
* Foreign [[loanword]]s: e.g. {{angbr|клише}} {{IPA|[kliˈʃɛ]}} 'cliché', {{angbr|генеза}} {{IPA|[ɡɛˈnɛza]}} 'genesis', {{angbr|литература}} {{IPA|[litɛraˈtura]}} 'literature', {{angbr|Александар}} {{IPA|[alɛkˈsandar]}}, '[[Alexander]]' (Possibly based on hellenised variations of indigenous Bryges and/or Enchele naming conventions), etc.

==Grammar==
{{Main|Macedonian grammar}}

Macedonian grammar is markedly [[Analytic language|analytic]] in comparison with other Slavic languages, having lost the common Slavic case system. The Macedonian language shows some special and, in some cases, unique characteristics due to its central position in the Balkans. Literary Macedonian is the only South Slavic literary language that has three forms of the definite article, based on the degree of proximity to the speaker, and a perfect tense formed by means of an [[auxiliary verb]] "to have", followed by a [[past tense|past]] [[participle]] in the [[Neuter gender|neuter]], also known as the [[verbal adjective]].

===Nouns===
Macedonian [[noun]]s (именки, ''imenki'') belong to one of three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and are [[Inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular and plural), and marginally for [[grammatical case|case]]. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.&lt;ref name="friedman, 2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seelrc.org:8080/grammar/mainframe.jsp?nLanguageID=3 |last=Friedman |first=Victor |year=2001 |title=Macedonian |page=40 |publisher=Slavic and Eurasian Language Resource Center (SEELRC), [[Duke University]] |date= |accessdate=2016-04-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728194528/http://www.seelrc.org:8080/grammar/mainframe.jsp?nLanguageID=3 |archivedate=July 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Macedonian nominal system distinguishes two [[grammatical number|numbers]] (singular and plural), three [[grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter), [[grammatical case|case]] and [[definiteness]]. Definiteness is expressed by three [[definite article]]s pertaining to the position of the object (unspecified, proximate, and distal), which are suffixed to the noun.

===Verbs===
Macedonian has a complex system of verbs. Generally speaking Macedonian verbs have the following characteristics, or categories as they are called in [[Macedonistics]]: tense, mood, person, type, transitiveness, voice, gender and number.

According to the categorization, all Macedonian verbs are divided into three major groups: a-group, e-group and i-group. Furthermore, the i-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: a-, e- and i-subgroups. This division is done according to the ending (or the last vowel) of the verb in the simple present, singular, third person.&lt;ref name="opsta"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Бојковска|first=Стојка|author2=Лилјана Минова|author3=Ѓуркова, Димитар Пандев|author4=Живко Цветковски|title=Општа граматика на македонскиот јазик|editor=Саветка Димитрова|publisher=АД Просветно Дело|location=Скопје|date=December 2008|isbn=9789989006623|trans-title=General Grammar of the Macedonian language}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2014}} Regarding the form, the verb forms can be either simple or complex.
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}

The Macedonian simple verb forms are:
* [[Present tense]] (сегашно време)
* [[Imperfect]] (минато определено несвршено време, 'past definite incomplete tense')
* [[Aorist]] (минато определено свршено време, 'past definite complete tense')
* [[Imperative mood|Imperative]] (заповеден начин)
* Verbal l-form (глаголска л-форма)
* Verbal adjective (глаголска придавка)
* [[Verbal noun]] (глаголска именка)
* Verbal adverb (глаголски прилог)

{{col-2}}

The Macedonian complex verb forms are:
* [[Perfect (grammar)|Perfect]] of imperfective verbs (минато неопределено несвршено време, 'past indefinite incomplete tense')
* [[Perfect (grammar)|Perfect]] of perfective verbs ( минато неопределено свршено време, 'past indefinite complete tense')
* [[Past perfect]] tense (предминато време)
* [[Future tense]] (идно време)
* Future-in-the-past (минато-идно време)
* Future perfect tense (идно прекажано)
* Potential mood (можен начин)
* Have-construction (има-конструкција)
* Be-construction (сум-конструкција)
* To-construction (да-конструкција)
{{col-end}}

===Prepositions===
[[Prepositions]] (предлози, ''predlozi'') are part of the closed word class that are used to express the relationship between the words in a sentence. Because Macedonian lost its case system, the prepositions are very important for creation and expression of various grammatical categories. The most important Macedonian preposition is 'na' ('of', 'on', 'to'). Regarding the form, the prepositions can either be ''simple'' or ''complex''. Based on the meaning the preposition express, they can be divided into prepositions of ''time, place, manner'' and ''quantity''.&lt;ref name="opsta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kepeski"&gt;Кепески, К. (1946), Македонска граматика, Скопје, Државно книгоиздавателство на Македонија.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==
[[File:Police car of Macedonia 04.JPG|thumb|Macedonian police car, with Macedonian word for "police".]]
As a result of the close relationship with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian]], Macedonian shares a considerable amount of its [[lexicon]] with these languages. Other languages that have been in positions of power, such as [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and, increasingly, [[English language|English]] have also provided a significant proportion of the [[loanword]]s. Prestige languages, such as [[Old Church Slavonic]]—which occupies a relationship to modern Macedonian comparable to the relationship of [[medieval Latin]] to modern [[Romance languages]]—and [[Russian language|Russian]] also provided a source for lexical items.

During the [[Codification (linguistics)|standardization process]], there was deliberate care taken to try to [[Linguistic purism|purify]] the lexicon of the language. Serbianisms and Bulgarianisms, which had become common due to the influence of these languages in the region were rejected in favor of words from native dialects and [[archaism]]s. One example was the word for "event", ''настан'' {{IPA|[ˈnastan]}}, which was found in certain examples of folk poetry collected by the [[Miladinov Brothers]] in the 19th century, whereas the Macedonian writer [[Krste Misirkov]] had previously used the word ''собитие'' {{IPA|[sɔˈbitiɛ]}}, a Russian loanword (''событие'').&lt;ref name="misirkov"&gt;In his most famous work "On the Macedonian Matters" (available [http://www.misirkov.org/ online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220160042/http://www.misirkov.org/ |date=2014-12-20 }}), [[Krste Misirkov|Misirkov]] uses the word ''собитие'' (a Russian [[loanword|loan]] taken from Bulgarian) where ''настан'' is used today.&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to say that there are no Serbianisms, Bulgarianisms or even [[Russianism]]s in the language, but rather that they were discouraged on a principle of "seeking native material first".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Friedman|1998|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language of the writers at the turn of the 19th century abounded with Russian and, more specifically, Old Church Slavonic lexical and morphological elements that in the contemporary norm are substituted with native words or [[calque]]d using [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] [[morpheme]]s.&lt;ref name="Dimitrovski"&gt;Т. Димитровски. ''Литературната лексика на македонскиот писмен јазик во XIX в. и нашиот однос кон неа'': Реферати на македонските слависти за VI Меѓународен славистички конгрес во Прага, Скопје, 1968 (T. Dimitrovski. ''The literary vocabulary of the Macedonian written language in the 19th century and our attitude to it''. Abstracts of Macedonian Slavists for the 6th International Slavic Studies Congress in Prague. Skopje, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the now slightly archaicized forms with suffixes&amp;nbsp;–''ние'' and&amp;nbsp;–''тел'', adjectives with the suffixes&amp;nbsp;–''телен'' and others, are now constructed following patterns more typical of Macedonian morphology. For example, ''дејствие'' ([[Russian language|Russ.]] ''действие'') corresponds to ''дејство'' 'action', ''лицемерие'' (Russ. ''лицемерие'') → ''лицемерство'' 'hypocrisy', ''развитие'' (Russ. ''развитие'') → ''развиток'' 'development', ''определение'' (Russ. ''определение'') → ''определба'' 'determination, orientation', ''движение'' (Russ. ''движение'') → ''движење'' 'movement', ''продолжител'' (Russ. ''продолжитель'') → ''продолжувач'' 'extender, continuator', ''победител'' (Russ. ''победитель'') → ''победник'' 'winner, victor', ''убедителен'' (Russ. ''убедительный'') → ''убедлив'' 'convincing, persuasive', etc.&lt;ref name="Dimitrovski" /&gt; Many of these words are now obsolete or archaic (as with ''развитие''), [[synonym]]ous (''лицемерие'' and ''лицемерство'') or have taken on a slightly different nuance in meaning (''дејствие'' 'military act' vs. ''дејство'' 'act, action' in a general sense).

The use of [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] loanwords is discouraged in the [[Register (sociolinguistics)|formal register]] when a native equivalent exists (e.g. ''комшија'' (← Turk.

''согласие'') → ''слога'' 'concord, agreement', etc.&lt;ref name="Dimitrovski" /&gt; This change was aimed at bringing written Macedonian closer to the spoken language, effectively distancing it from the Bulgarian language with its numerous Russian loans, and represents a successful [[Linguistic purism|puristic]] attempt to abolish a lexicogenic tradition once common in written [[literature]].&lt;ref name="Dimitrovski" /&gt;

==Writing system==

===Alphabet===
{{Main|Macedonian alphabet|Macedonian braille}}
The modern Macedonian alphabet was developed by linguists in the period after the [[World War II|Second World War]], who based their alphabet on the phonetic alphabet of [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]], though a similar writing system was used by [[Krste Misirkov]] in the early 20th century. The Macedonian language had previously been written using the [[Early Cyrillic alphabet]], or later using the [[Cyrillic script]] with local adaptations from either the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian]] or [[Bulgarian alphabet|Bulgarian]] alphabets.

The following table provides the upper and lower case forms of the Macedonian alphabet, along with the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] value for each letter:

===Orthography===
Macedonian orthography is consistent and phonemic in practice, an approximation of the principle of one [[grapheme]] per [[phoneme]]. A principle represented by [[Johann Christoph Adelung|Adelung]]'s saying, "write as you speak and read as it is written" ("пишувај како што зборуваш и читај како што е напишано"). However, there are occasional inconsistencies or exceptions.

At this time, the Slavic dialects were so close as to make it practical to develop the written language on the dialect of a single region. The [[Ohrid Literary School]] was established in Ohrid in 886 by [[Saint Clement of Ohrid]] on orders of [[Boris I of Bulgaria]]. In the fourteenth century, the Ottoman Turks invaded and conquered most of the Balkans, incorporating Macedonia into the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Although the written language, now called [[Old Church Slavonic]], remained static as a result of Turkish domination, the spoken dialects moved further apart.

The earliest lexicographic evidence of the Macedonian dialects, described as Bulgarian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slav.uni-sofia.bg/lilijournal/index.php/bg/issues/contents-spring2010/articles-spring2010/170-ilieval-2010 Littera et Lingua] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112190002/http://www.slav.uni-sofia.bg/lilijournal/index.php/bg/issues/contents-spring2010/articles-spring2010/170-ilieval-2010 |date=2013-11-12 }}, {{ISSN|1312-6172}}, Пролет 2010, Лилия Илиева, Нови данни за българската поезия през XVI и XVII век.&lt;/ref&gt; can be found in a lexicon from the 16th century written in the Greek alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mn.mk/docs/Makedonski-Leksikon-XVI-vek.pdf 'Un Lexique Macedonien Du XVIe Siecle'], Giannelli, Ciro. Avec la collaboration de Andre Vaillant, 1958&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the various [[Macedonian dialects]] as a part of the Bulgarian language&lt;ref&gt;Concise encyclopedia of languages of the world, Keith Brown, Sarah Ogilvie, Elsevier, 2008, {{ISBN|0-08-087774-5}}, pp. 120; 663.&lt;/ref&gt; can be seen also from early vernacular texts from Macedonia such as the four-language dictionary of [[Daniel Moscopolites]], the works of [[Kiril Peichinovich]] and [[Yoakim Karchovski]], and some vernacular gospels written in the Greek alphabet. These written works influenced by or completely written in the local Slavic [[vernacular]] appeared in Macedonia in the 18th and beginning of the 19th century and their authors referred to their language as Bulgarian.&lt;ref&gt;F. A. K. Yasamee "NATIONALITY IN THE BALKANS: THE CASE OF THE MACEDONIANS" in Balkans: A Mirror of the New World Order, Istanbul: EREN, 1995; pp. 121–132.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845 the [[Russia]]n scholar [[Viktor Grigorovich]] travelled in the Balkans to study the south Slavic dialects of Macedonia. His work articulated for the first time a distinct pair of two groups of [[Bulgarian dialects]]: Eastern and Western (spoken in today Western Bulgaria and Republic of Macedonia). According to his findings, a part of the Western Bulgarian variety, spoken in Macedonia, was characterized by traces of Old Slavic nasal vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Seriot|1997|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the increase of national consciousness in the Balkans, standards for the languages of [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Serbo-Croatian]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] were created. As Turkish influence in Macedonia waned, schools were opened up that taught the Bulgarian standard language in areas with significant Bulgarian population.

However, the Russian linguist of Bulgarian origin, [[Petar Draganov]] (1857–1928), after his visit to Macedonia, strongly opposed this 'Bulgarian origin of the Macedonian dialects', and he claimed that Macedonia is a separate ethnogeographic unit of the [[Balkans]] and the [[Macedonian dialects]] form a separate language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=hE5PxJjrI8AC |page=80 }} |title=and the Macedonians: a history By Andrew Rossos |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2014-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar ideas were proposed in [[Krste Misirkov]]'s works. Misirkov was born in a village near [[Pella]] in [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]]. Although literature had been written in the Slavic dialects of Macedonia before, arguably the most important book published in relation to the Macedonian language was Misirkov's ''On Macedonian Matters'', published in 1903. In that book, he argued for creation of a standard literary Macedonian language from the central dialects of Macedonia that would use a [[phonemic orthography]].

After the first two Balkan wars, the region of Macedonia was split between Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia (later [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], Yugoslavia). Serbia occupied the area that is currently the Republic of Macedonia incorporating it into the Kingdom as "Southern Serbia". During this time, Yugoslav Macedonia became known as [[Vardar Banovina]] (Vardar province) and the language of public life, education and the church was Serbo-Croatian. In the other two parts of Macedonia the respective national languages, Greek and Bulgarian, were made official. In Bulgarian (Pirin) Macedonia, the local dialects continued to be described as dialects of Bulgarian.
[[File:Reseniie na asnom za jazik.jpg|thumbnail|right|Decision about language on ASNOM, 2 August 1944]]

During the [[second World War]], most of Yugoslav Macedonia was occupied by the Bulgarian army, who was allied with the Axis. The standard Bulgarian language was reintroduced in schools and [[liturgies]]. The Bulgarians were initially welcomed as liberators from Serbian domination until connections were made between the imposition of the Bulgarian language and unpopular Serbian [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;The A to Z of Bulgaria, Raymond Detrez, Scarecrow Press, Incorporated, 2010, {{ISBN|0-8108-7202-1}}, p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the Macedonian communists were then pro-Bulgarian oriented, but later the Bulgarians were seen as conquerors by the communist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=ZMyZdvTympMC |page=119 |title=Yugoslavism: Histories of a Failed Idea, 1918–1992, Dejan Djokíc, C.

The eventual outcome was that almost all of [[Vardar Banovina]] (i.e. the areas that geographically became known as [[Vardar Macedonia]]) was incorporated into the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] as a constituent [[Socialist Republic]] with the Macedonian language holding official status within both the Federation and Republic. The Macedonian language was proclaimed the official language of the Republic of Macedonia at the First Session of the Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia, held on August 2, 1944. The first official Macedonian grammar was developed by Krume Kepeski. One of the most important contributors in the standardisation of the Macedonian literary language was [[Blaže Koneski]]. The first document written in the literary standard Macedonian language is the first issue of the ''[[Nova Makedonija]]'' newspaper in 1944. ''Makedonska Iskra'' (Macedonian Spark) was the first Macedonian newspaper published in Australia, from 1946 to 1957. A monthly with national distribution, it commenced in Perth and later moved to Melbourne and Sydney.

==Political views on the language==
{{Main|Political views on the Macedonian language|Macedonian language naming dispute}}

As with the issue of [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian ethnicity]], the politicians, linguists and common people from Macedonia and neighbouring countries have opposing views about the existence and distinctiveness of the Macedonian language.

In the ninth century AD, [[saints Cyril and Methodius]] introduced [[Old Church Slavonic]], the first Slavic language of literacy. Written with their newly invented [[Glagolitic]] script, this language was based largely on the dialect of Slavs spoken around [[Thessaloniki]]; this dialect is closest to present-day Macedonian and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dostál|1965|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although described as being dialects of Bulgarian&lt;ref name="Stoykov"&gt;{{Citation |title=Българска диалектология (Bulgarian dialectology)|last=Стойков (Stoykov)|first=Стойко |authorlink=Stoyko Stoykov |origyear=1962 |year=2002 |location=София |publisher=Акад. изд.

===Bulgarian view===
{{See also|Macedonians (Bulgarians)}}
In most sources in and out of Bulgaria before the Second World War, the [[South Slavic dialect continuum|southern Slavonic dialect continuum]] covering the area of today's [[Republic of Macedonia]] and [[Northern Greece]] was referred to as a group of Bulgarian dialects. The local variants of the name of the language were also ''balgàrtzki'', ''bùgarski'' or ''bugàrski''; i.e. Bulgarian.&lt;ref&gt;Шклифов, Благой and Екатерина Шклифова, Български деалектни текстове от Егейска Македония, София 2003, с. 28–33 (Shklifov, Blagoy and Ekaterina Shklifova. Bulgarian dialect texts from Aegean Macedonia Sofia 2003, p. 28–36)&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bulgaria was the first country to recognize the independence of the Republic of Macedonia, most of its academics, as well as the general public, regard the language spoken there as a form of Bulgarian.{{ref|Mahon1}} However, after years of diplomatic impasse caused by an academic dispute, in 1999 the government in Sofia solved the problem of the Macedonian language by using the [[euphemistic]] formula: "the official language of the country (Republic of Macedonia) in accordance with its constitution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aimpress.ch/dyn/trae/archive/data/199902/90222-005-trae-sof.htm |title=1999/02/22 23:50 Bulgaria Recognises Macedonian Language |publisher=Aimpress.ch |date= |accessdate=2014-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek view===
{{See also|Macedonia naming dispute}}
Greeks were objecting to the use of the "Macedonian" name in reference to the modern Slavic language, calling it "[[Slavomacedonian language|Slavomacedonian]]" ({{lang-el|σλαβομακεδονική γλώσσα}}), a term coined by some members of the Slavic-speaking community of northern Greece itself.&lt;ref name="offensivegr"&gt;Although acceptable in the past, current use of this name in reference to both the ethnic group and the language can be considered [[pejorative]] and offensive by ethnic Macedonians. In the past, the Macedonian Slavs in Greece seemed relieved to be acknowledged as ''Slavomacedonians''. Pavlos Koufis, a native of Greek Macedonia, pioneer of ethnic Macedonian schools in the region and local historian, says in ''Laografika Florinas kai Kastorias'' (Folklore of Florina and Kastoria), Athens 1996:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[During its Panhellenic Meeting in September 1942, the KKE mentioned that it recognises the equality of the ethnic minorities in Greece] the KKE recognised that the Slavophone population was ethnic minority of Slavomacedonians. This was a term, which the inhabitants of the region accepted with relief. [Because] Slavomacedonians = Slavs+Macedonians. The first section of the term determined their origin and classified them in the great family of the Slav peoples."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[Greek Helsinki Monitor]] reports:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"... the term Slavomacedonian was introduced and was accepted by the community itself, which at the time had a much more widespread non-Greek Macedonian ethnic consciousness. Unfortunately, according to members of the community, this term was later used by the Greek authorities in a pejorative, discriminatory way; hence the reluctance if not hostility of modern-day Macedonians of Greece (i.e. people with a Macedonian national identity) to accept it."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 3 June 2018, the Greek Minister of Shipping and Island Policy Panagiotis Kouroublis, acknowledged that Greece fully recognizes the term "Macedonian language" for the modern Slavic language, since the 1977 UN Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/375119/kouroublis-to-1977-i-ellada-anagnorise-makedoniki-glossa-/|title=Kouroublis: In 1977, Greece recognized «Macedonian language» (original: Κουρουμπλής: To 1977 η Ελλάδα αναγνώρισε «μακεδονική γλώσσα»)|publisher=Skai Channel |date= |accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fact confirmed on 6 June by the Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias, who stated that the language was recognized by the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]]-led government of that time. Kotzias also revealed classified documents confirming the use of the term "Macedonian Language" by the past governments of Greece, as well as pointing out to official statements of the Greek Prime Minister [[Evangelos Averoff]] who in 1954 and 1959 used the term "Macedonian language" to refer to the South Slavic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thepressproject.gr/article/130809/Ta-aporrita-eggrafa-pou-katethese-o-Kotzias-gia-PGDM|title=The classified documents submitted by Kotzias about the Republic of Macedonia (original: Τα απόρρητα έγγραφα που κατέθεσε ο Κοτζιάς για ΠΓΔΜ)|website=thepressproject.gr|publisher=The Press Project|language=gr|date=6 June 2018|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.gr/news/politiki/story/134942/ta-aporrita-arxeia-poy-katethese-sti-voyli-o-nikos-kotzias|title=The classified files submitted by Nikos Kotzias in the Parliament (pics)(original: Τα απόρρητα αρχεία που κατέθεσε στη Βουλή ο Νίκος Κοτζιάς (pics))|website=www.cnn.gr|publisher=CNN|language=gr|date=18 June 2018|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A week later, on 12 June, the Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, announced that the recognition of the Macedonian language by Greece is reaffirmed in the [[Prespa agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zaev:We made a deal - Republic of North Macedonia, with Macedonian language and Macedonian identity |url=https://kajgana.com/zaev-postignavme-dogovor-republika-severna-makedonija-so-makedonski-jazik-i-makedonski-identitet |website=kajgana.com |publisher=Кајгана |language=mk |date=12 June 2018 |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mangalorean Catholics''' ([[Konkani language|Konkani]]: ''Kodialchein Katholik'') are an [[ethno-religious]] community of [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] following the [[Latin Rite]] from the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mangalore|Mangalore Diocese]] (erstwhile ''[[South Canara]]'' district) on the southwestern coast of [[Karnataka]], India.&lt;ref name="spo"&gt;{{harvnb|Koṅkṇi humiṇyo|1981|loc=p. 203: "This city (Mangalore) has a very influential proportion of Roman Catholics, numbering over a good quarter of the total population. It is the seat of the Mangalore Roman Catholic Diocese [[Latin Rite]], and hence when we speak of the Mangalorean Catholics, we do not limit ourselves only to the roughly 60,000 Catholics within the city limits, but to a total of much over {{formatnum:200000}} Catholics spread over the whole diocese, which is co-terminous with the civil district of South Kanara."|Ref=khm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farias|1999|p=299}}: "Four centuries of living in South Kanara gave these Catholics an identity of their own. Thus they are commonly known as ''Mangalorean Catholics''."&lt;/ref&gt; They are [[Konkani people]] and speak the [[Konkani language|Konkani]] language. 

Contemporary Mangalorean Catholics are descended mainly from [[Goan Catholics|Goan Catholic]]s who migrated to South Canara between 1560 and 1763, throughout the course of the [[Goa Inquisition]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]]–[[Bijapur Sultanate|Adil Shahi]] wars, and the Portuguese–[[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] wars. They learned the languages of South Canara, [[Tulu language|Tulu]], and [[Kannada language|Kannada]], but retained Konkani as their mother tongue and preserved their lifestyle. Their [[Captivity of Mangalorean Catholics at Seringapatam|15-year captivity]] at [[Seringapatam]] imposed by [[Tipu Sultan]], the ''de facto'' ruler of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], from 24 February 1784 to 4 May 1799 led to the near extinction of the community. After Tipu's defeat and subsequent killing by the [[British Empire|British]] in 1799, the community resettled in South Canara, and later prospered under British rule.

Although early assertions of a distinct Mangalorean Catholic identity date from the migration period, a developed Mangalorean Catholic cultural identity only emerged following the captivity. The culture of Mangalorean Catholics is a blend of [[Culture of Mangalore|Mangalorean]] and [[Culture of Goa|Goan]] cultures. After migration, they adopted some aspects of the local Mangalorean culture, but retained many of their Goan customs and traditions, and like their Goan ancestors, modern Mangalorean Catholic culture can be best described as an increasingly Anglicised Indo-Latin culture. The Mangalorean Catholic diaspora is mostly concentrated in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] and the [[English-speaking world]].

==Ethnic identity==
The Roman Catholics from the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mangalore|Mangalore Diocese]] and  the newly formed Udupi Diocese (erstwhile ''[[South Canara]]'' district) and their descendents are generally known as Mangalorean Catholics.&lt;ref name="spo"/&gt; The diocese is located on the southwestern coast of India. It comprises the civil districts of [[Dakshina Kannada]] and [[Udupi District|Udupi]] in Karnataka state, and [[Kasaragod district|Kasaragod]] in Kerala state. This region was collectively referred to as [[South Canara]] during the [[British Raj|British ''Raj'']] and then from the [[partition of India]] until the [[States Reorganisation Act]] of 1956.&lt;ref name="MD"/&gt;

In 1526, Portuguese ships arrived in Mangalore, and the number of local converts to Christianity slowly increased. However, a sizeable Christian population did not exist there until the second half of the 16th century, when there was a large-scale immigration of Christians from Goa to South Canara. They were reluctant to learn the local languages of South Canara&lt;ref name="sf6"/&gt; and continued to speak Konkani, the language they brought from Goa, so that local Christians had to learn Konkani to converse with them.&lt;ref name="sf6"&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this migration, the skilled [[Goan Catholic]] agriculturists were offered various land grants by the native [[Keladi Nayaka|Bednore]] rulers of South Canara.&lt;ref name="sf6"/&gt; They observed their traditional [[Hindu]] customs in conjunction with the newfound Catholic practices, and preserved their lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most migrants were people from the lower economic strata who had been left out of government and economic jobs; their lands had been confiscated due to heavy taxation under the Portuguese in Goa. As a consequence of the wealth and privileges which these Goan migrants enjoyed in Mangalore, they began feeling superior to their landless kindred in Goa. Their [[Captivity of Mangalorean Catholics at Seringapatam|captivity at Seringapatam]] (1784–1799), where many died, were killed, or were forcibly converted to [[Islam]], led to the formation of a separate and common Mangalorean Catholic cultural identity among members of the group, who hitherto had considered themselves an extension of the larger Goan Catholic community. They no longer self-identified as Goan Catholics.&lt;ref name="mloreans"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larsen|1998|p=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their years of captivity, prosperity under the British and under Italian [[Jesuit]]s, followed by migration for employment to [[Mumbai|Bombay]], [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], [[Pune|Poona]], the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf Arab states]], and the [[English-speaking world]], enabled the community to restore their identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larsen|1998|p=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelming majority of Mangalorean Catholics are of [[Goud Saraswat Brahmin]] lineage.&lt;ref name="my0687"&gt;{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=XV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fernandes|1969|p=246}} "The bulk of our Hindu ancestors belonged to the Saraswat and the Goud Saraswat Brahmin communities."&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Alan Machado Prabhu estimates that almost 95 per cent of Mangalorean Catholics have Goan origins.&lt;ref name="jp0687"&gt;{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-migration era===
[[File:Stmarys udupi 1.JPG|thumb|left|St Mary's Islands in [[Udupi]], where the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed in 1498]]
All records of an early existence of Christians in South Canara were lost at the time of their deportation by [[Tipu Sultan]] in 1784. Hence, it is not known exactly when Christianity was introduced in South Canara, although it is possible that [[Saint Thomas Christians|Syrian Christians]] settled in South Canara, just as they did in [[Kerala]], a state south of Canara.&lt;ref name="sf4"&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian traveller [[Marco Polo]] recorded that there were considerable trading activities between the [[Red Sea]] and the Canara coast in the 13th century. It can be surmised that foreign Christian merchants were visiting the coastal towns of South Canara during that period for commerce; it is possible some Christian priests might have accompanied them for evangelistic work.&lt;ref name="sc101"&gt;{{harvnb|South Kanara District Gazetteer|1973|p=101|Ref=sc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1321 the French [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar [[Jordanus|Jordanus Catalani]] of Severac (in south-western France) landed at [[Thane|Thana]] with four other friars.&lt;ref name="mc3"&gt;{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then travelled to [[Bhatkal]] in [[North Canara]], a port town on the coastal route from Thana to [[Quilon]].&lt;ref name="jor"&gt;{{harvnb|Jordanus|Yule|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nhcH4E3li3AC&amp;pg=RA1-PA40&amp;dq=&amp;sig=ACfU3U2ge4SFVJc_2n4j3WCN9iRiPqM26Q#PRA1-PA40,M1 40]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mc2"/&gt; Being the first bishop of India and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Quilon|Quilon Diocese]], he was entrusted the spiritual nourishment of Christian community in Mangalore and other parts of India by [[Pope John XXII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quilondiocese.org/former%20prelates%20of%20diocese.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618161814/http://quilondiocese.org/former%20prelates%20of%20diocese.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 June 2006 |title=The great prelates who shaped the history of Diocese of Quilon |accessdate=14 January 2008 |publisher=[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Quilon|Quilon Diocese]] |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Severine Silva, no concrete evidence has yet been found that there were any permanent settlements of Christians in South Canara before the 16th century. It was only after the advent of the Portuguese in the region that Christianity began to spread.&lt;ref name="sc101"/&gt;

In 1498 the Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] landed on a group of islands in South Canara on his voyage from Portugal to India. He named the islands ''El Padron de Santa Maria''; they later came to be known as [[St Mary's Island, Karnataka|St Mary's Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1500 Portuguese explorer [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] arrived at [[Anjadip Island|Anjediva]] in North Canara with eight [[Franciscan]] missionaries. Under the leadership of Frei Henrique Soares de Coimbra, the missionaries converted 22 or 23 natives to Christianity in the Mangalore region.&lt;ref name="mc2"&gt;{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early part of the 16th century, [[Krishnadevaraya]] (1509–1529), the ruler of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] of [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]], granted commercial privileges to the Portuguese on the Canara coast. There was complete freedom of worship, belief, and propagation of religious tenets in the Vijaynagara Empire.&lt;ref name="sc101"/&gt; In 1526, under the viceroyship of [[Lopo Vaz de Sampaio]], the Portuguese took possession of Mangalore.&lt;ref name="sch52"&gt;{{harvnb|South Kanara District Gazetteer|1973|p=52|Ref=sch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese Franciscans slowly started propagating Christianity in Mangalore.&lt;ref name="sch52"/&gt; The most prominent local convert was the Brahmin ''[[mahant]]'' Shankarayya, who in 1751 travelled with his wife from [[Kallianpur]] to Goa and was baptised, with the Portuguese viceroy assuming the role of his godfather. The honoured ''mahant'' took the name of Francisco de Távora, after the Viceroy [[Francisco de Távora|Marques de Távora]].&lt;ref name="ft0687"&gt;{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shankarayya"&gt;{{harvnb|Shastry|Borges|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=raLL0A3Pb_0C&amp;pg=PA260#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 260]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their properties were subsequently taken over by their Hindu relatives, but the viceroy instructed his factor of Mangalore to get their property restored.&lt;ref name="Shankarayya"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pinto|1999|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1534 Canara was placed under the ecclesiastic jurisdiction of the Bishop of Goa, where the Portuguese had a strong presence. Missionaries soon arrived and gained converts. The number of local converts in South Canara continually increased until 1546.&lt;ref name="sf4"/&gt; During the mid-16th century, the Portuguese faced resistance from [[Abbakka Rani]] of [[Ullal]], the Queen of the Bednore dynasty. This put a halt to conversions. The first battle between Abbakka Rani and the Portuguese was fought in 1546; she emerged victorious and drove the Portuguese out of South Canara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://hindu.com/2007/10/23/stories/2007102350570200.htm |last=Raghuram |first=M |title=Abbakka's legacy being revived |accessdate=24 August 2008 |publisher=''[[The Hindu]]'' |location=Chennai, India |date=23 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66KrFMMbT?url=http://hindu.com/2007/10/23/stories/2007102350570200.htm |archivedate=21 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1510, a Portuguese fleet under [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], sent by King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], wrested the region of Goa from ''Sultan'' [[Yusuf Adil Shah]] of [[Adil Shahi dynasty|Bijapur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mathew|first=K.

Soon missionaries were sent to Goa, which led to conversion of a sizeable population to [[Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shastry|Borges|2000|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of Christian settlers came in three major migration waves towards South Canara. These migrations occurred in periods of great unrest: the [[Goa Inquisition]] occurred from 1560 onwards; the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]]–Adil Shahi wars were between 1570–79; and the Portuguese–[[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] wars occurred between 1667–83 and 1737–40.&lt;ref name="amp16"/&gt; Other factors that led to mass migrations were disease epidemics, famines, natural calamities, overpopulation, poor living conditions, heavy tax burdens, and social discrimination by the Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pinto|1999|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1542, the [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarrese]] Jesuit Francis Xavier, co-founder of the Society of Jesus; arrived in Goa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schurhammern|first=Georg|title=Francis Xavier; His Life, His Times: India, 1541–1545|page=148|publisher=Jesuit Historical Institute|isbn=978-0-8294-0355-8|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered that the newly converted Christians were practising their old Hindu customs and traditions. He requested the Portuguese king [[John III of Portugal|João III]] to install an [[Inquisition]] in Goa in 1545.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baring-Gould S (Sabine)|year=2009|title=The Lives of the Saints, Volume XIV|publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC|page=629|isbn= 978-1-110-73420-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Goan ancestors of the present Mangalorean Catholics fled Goa when the Inquisition began in 1560. [[Sebastian of Portugal|King Sebastião I]] decreed that every trace of Indian customs should be eradicated through the Inquisition. Many Christians of Goa were tenaciously attached to some of their ancient Indian customs, especially their traditional Hindu marriage costumes, and refused to abandon them.&lt;ref name="rod"&gt;{{Cite journal

The Christians who left Goa were for the most part skilled agriculturists who abandoned their irrigated fields in Goa to achieve freedom.&lt;ref name="Mercury"/&gt; The remainder were skilled carpenters, goldsmiths, artisans, and merchants.&lt;ref name="Pius"&gt;{{harvnb|Pinto|1999|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of migration, Canara was ruled by the [[Keladi Nayaka|Keladi]] king [[Shivappa Nayaka]] (1540–60). He evinced great interest in the development of agriculture in his empire and welcomed these agriculturists to his kingdom, giving them fertile lands to cultivate.&lt;ref name="Mercury"/&gt; They were recruited into the armies of the Bednore dynasty.&lt;ref name="sc102"&gt;{{harvnb|South Kanara District Gazetteer|1973|p=102|Ref=sc}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref label|a|a|none}} This was confirmed by [[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton|Francis Buchanan]], a Scottish physician, when he visited Canara in 1801. In his book ''A Journey from Madras through the Countries of Mysore, Canara and Malabar'' (1807), he stated that "The princes of the house of Ikkeri had given great encouragement to the Christians, and had induced 80,000&amp;nbsp;of them to settle in [[Tulu Nadu|Tuluva]]."&lt;ref name="buc23"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchanan|1988|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bK4Ba6824koC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA23,M1 23]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="buc24"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchanan|1988|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bK4Ba6824koC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA24,M1 24]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, this was identified as a probable mistake and should have read "8,000". This figure included the second emigration of Christians from Goa.&lt;ref name="Mercury"&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The taxation policies of the Keladi Nayakas during 1598–1763 enabled the Goan Catholic migrants to emerge as prominent landowning gentry in South Canara.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larsen|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6jF4Q5jQWboC&amp;pg=PA353#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 353]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These migrants usually brought their own capital from Goa, which they invested in their new lands, thereby indirectly contributing to the prosperity of the Keladi kingdom.&lt;ref name="Pius"/&gt;

Under the provisional treaties between the Portuguese and the Bednore rulers, and the [[Padroado]], the Christians were allowed to build churches and help foster the growth of Christianity in South Canara.&lt;ref name="sc102"/&gt; The arrival of the British and the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] halted the activity of the Portuguese, and they were gradually unable to send the required number of missionaries to Mangalore.&lt;ref name="dm"/&gt; Shivappa Nayaka had previously expelled the Portuguese from their forts a little before 1660, which brought about considerable changes in the ecclesiastical situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|George|2010|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment of the [[Vicar Apostolic]] of Mangalore was felt by the [[Holy See]] to be of critical importance. Nayaka pressured the church authorities to appoint a native priest as the Vicar Apostolic, which resulted in the appointment of Fr. Andrew Gomez to the post; however, he died before the nomination papers could reach Mangalore.&lt;ref name="ver"/&gt;

At the recommendation of the [[Vicar General]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Verapoly|Verapoly]], Mons. Joseph Sebastiani, Pope [[Clement X]] appointed [[Thomas de Castro|Bishop Thomas de Castro]], a Goan [[theatines|Theatine]] and Bishop of Fulsivelem, as the Vicar Apostolic of [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Propaganda Fide]] in the [[Apostolic vicariate|Vicariate]] of Canara on 30 August 1675, for the purpose of providing spiritual leadership to the Canara Christians.&lt;ref name="ver"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.verapolyarchdiocese.org/history.htm |title=Brief history of the Archdiocese of Verapoly |publisher=[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Verapoly|Archdiocese of Verapoly]] |accessdate=22 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66Ks4BCZN?url=http://www.verapolyarchdiocese.org/history.htm |archivedate=21 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Propaganda"&gt;{{harvnb|Pinto|1999|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his consecration, he first went to [[Zamorin|Calicut]] and then moved to Mangalore, where he served from 1677 to 1684.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pinto|1999|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1677, Bishop de Castro entered into a conflict with the Archbishop of Goa, Dom Frei António Brandão, for disregarding the Padroado. Consequently, they did not cede the jurisdiction to him despite the Pope's letter of appointment.&lt;ref name="Vicar"/&gt; The Padroado–Propaganda conflict which ensued divided the Catholics of Canara into two sides—those who recognised the authority of the Padroado Archbishop in Goa versus those who supported de Castro.&lt;ref name="Propaganda"/&gt;

The Portuguese refused to recognise Bishop de Castro's appointment and vigorously opposed his activities. Archbishop Brandão's sudden death on 6 July 1678 further complicated matters, and the [[Cathedral chapter]] administering the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Goa and Daman|Archdiocese of Goa]] following the vacancy created by his death, forbade the Canara Catholics from receiving the sacraments from the bishop or from priests appointed by him. In his turn, Bishop de Castro excommunicated those Catholics who were obedient to the Padroado authorities in Goa and their priests.&lt;ref name="Propaganda"/&gt; In 1681, the Holy See appointed another Goan priest [[Blessed Joseph Vaz|Fr. Joseph Vaz]], as the [[Archpriest|Vicar Forane]] of Canara; he was asked not to submit to Bishop de Castro unless he showed the letter of appointment.&lt;ref name="Vicar"&gt;{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after being convinced of its legitimacy, Fr. Vaz submitted to Bishop de Castro and brought about a truce. He further managed to persuade the bishop to delegate his jurisdiction to him while retaining the post.&lt;ref name="amp17"/&gt; In 1700, the Catholics of Canara were again brought under the jurisdiction of the Padroado Archbishop of Goa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pinto|1999|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Milagres Church (Mangalore)|Milagres Church]], one of the oldest churches in South Canara, was built in 1680 by Bishop Thomas de Castro.&lt;ref name="dm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sf 9"&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 1570, the ''[[Sultan]]'' of [[Adil Shahi dynasty|Bijapur]], [[Ali Adil Shah I]], entered into an alliance with the ''Sultan'' of [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate|Ahmadnagar]], Murtaza Nizam Shah, and the ''[[Zamorin]]'' of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] for a simultaneous attack on the Portuguese territories of Goa, [[Chaul]], and Mangalore.&lt;ref name="amp16"/&gt; He attacked Goa in 1571 and ended Portuguese influence in the region. The Bijapur ''Sultans'' were especially renowned for their loathing of Christianity.&lt;ref name="pra"/&gt; Fearing persecution, many Goan Catholics fled to South Canara during this second wave of migrations, and settled in [[Barkur|Barcoor]], [[Kallianpur]], [[Kundapura|Cundapore]], and [[Basrur|Basroor]].&lt;ref name="amp16"&gt;{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pra"/&gt; For the next century, there was continual migration of Goan Catholics southwards, so that by 1650, a considerable number of Catholics were settled around Mangalore, [[Mulki, Karnataka|Moolki]], [[Shirva, India|Shirva]], Pezar, [[Bantval]], Cundapore, Kallianpur, and Kirem.&lt;ref name="amp16"/&gt; The Christian Goud Saraswat Brahmins who came during this wave belonged mostly to the [[Shenoy|Shenvi]] subcaste.&lt;ref name="Mercury"/&gt;

[[File:Sambhaji Maharaj.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The Maratha ruler Sambhaji's onslaught was responsible for the third and final great wave of migrations to South Canara.]]

The attacks of the Maratha Empire on Goa during the mid-16th century precipitated the third major wave of migrations. In 1664 [[Shivaji]], the founder of the Maratha empire, attacked [[Kudal]], a town north of Goa, and began his campaign for Goa. After Shivaji's death on 3 April 1680, his son [[Sambhaji]] ascended to the throne.&lt;ref name="pra"/&gt; The onslaught of Sambahji along the northern territories of Goa drove nearly all the Christians from their homelands, and most of them migrated to South Canara. Migration increased with the fall of the Portuguese "Province of the North" (which included [[Vasai|Bassein]], [[Chaul]] and [[Salsette]]) and a direct threat to the very existence of Goa in 1738–40.&lt;ref name="amp17"/&gt;

According to one estimate, emigrations from the [[Salcete]] district of Goa were around the rate of 2,000 annually. Jesuit priests estimated that 12,000 Christians emigrated from the [[Bardez]] district of Goa between 1710–12, most of them going southward. A Goa government report of 1747 presently in the [[Panjim]] archives records that around 5,000 Christians fled from the Bardez and [[Tiswadi]] districts of Goa during the Maratha invasion.&lt;ref name="mc22"&gt;{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Maratha raids on Goa, about 60,000 Christians migrated to South Canara.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kurzon|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=p5iK3CmIW6EC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA77,M1 77]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new migrants were given lands at [[Shirva, India|Shirva]], Kirem, [[Mundkur]], Pezar, and [[Hosabettu]] by the [[Chowta]] kings of [[Moodbidri]] and at Milagres, Bondel, and Cordel by the Banghel kings of Mangalore.&lt;ref name="amp17"&gt;{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During later years, migration slowed because of the Maratha–[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] wars, and some 10,000 Christians returned to Goa.&lt;ref name="pra"&gt;{{cite book

Subsequent to this steady rise in South Canara's Catholic population, the Portuguese took advantage of every opportunity to extend their control over the Mangalorean Catholics, who came to be identified with Portuguese interests.&lt;ref name="D'Mello"/&gt;
The Portuguese sought to expand the power of the priests, as from the beginning of their empire, priests had accompanied Portuguese delegations on diplomatic missions and on occasion were the principal negotiatiors. Treaties they signed with the Keladi Nayakas progressively incorporated clauses which increased the authority of the priests over the local Catholic population, making them obedient to the priests in matters of Christian laws as well as granting priests the authority to punish violations.&lt;ref name="D'Mello"&gt;{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese promised to refrain from slaughtering cows and to halt forcible conversions in their [[Factory (trading post)|factories]].&lt;ref name="D'Mello"/&gt; The terms of these treaties were not always honoured by the Portuguese, with the result that whenever hostilities broke out between the Keladis and the Portuguese, the Catholic settlers were often harassed or arrested by the Nayakas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-migration era and captivity===
{{main|Captivity of Mangalorean Catholics at Seringapatam}}
[[File:Tipu Sultan BL.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tipu Sultan]] (1750–1799), the architect of the Seringapatam captivity]]
In 1686, [[Srirangapatna|Seringapatam]], the capital of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], had a community of more than 400 Catholics. The community was severely harassed in the following two decades, with the churches destroyed and the priest's house confiscated. The destruction was undertaken under the name of the [[Wodeyar]] king, [[Kanthirava Narasaraja I]], by his finance minister. The priest's house was returned to the church in 1709.&lt;ref name="George"&gt;{{harvnb|George|2010|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between the Wodeyars and the Mangalorean Catholics improved until 1717, when there was an anti-Christian outburst. The resident priest was expelled and forbidden to preach. Several more anti-Christian outbursts followed. By 1736, there were better relations between the two groups.&lt;ref name="Shirvagar"&gt;{{harvnb|George|2010|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1761 onwards, [[Hyder Ali]], a distinguished soldier in the Mysore army, took ''de facto'' control of the throne of the Kingdom of Mysore through the Wodeyar dynasty. Hyder occupied Mangalore in 1763.&lt;ref name="sch62"/&gt; The Mangalorean Catholics numbered 80,000 in 1767.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rural Industrialization in Backward Areas|2006|p=37|Ref=more}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1768 the British captured Mangalore from Hyder.&lt;ref name="sch62"&gt;{{harvnb|South Kanara District Gazetteer|1973|p=62|Ref=sch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of 1768, Hyder and his son Tipu Sultan defeated the British and recaptured Mangalore fort. After the conquest, Hyder was informed that the Mangalorean Catholics had helped the British in their conquest of Mangalore. Hyder believed that this behaviour of the Christians amounted to treachery against the sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|1957|loc=N. 6, p. 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christians were alleged to have helped General Mathews with a sum of Rs. 3,30,000/-.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jayadev|1996|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyder summoned a Portuguese officer and several Christian priests from Mangalore to suggest the punishment for the Mangalorean Catholics for treachery. The Portuguese officer suggested the death penalty for those Catholics who helped the British, because it was a fitting punishment for people who betrayed the sovereign. But Hyder exhibited a diplomatic stance and imprisoned the Christians, rather than killing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tour|1855|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5ryCAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=history%20of%20hyder%20sha&amp;pg=PA236#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 236]: As soon as Hyder was informed of this, he caused these merchants to appear before him, with the chief of the Portuguese factory, and several Christian priests belonging to the three churches at Mangalore. He then demanded of the Portuguese chief and the priests, what punishment the Christians inflict on those who should presume to betray their sovereign, by giving assistance to his enemies. The Portuguese officer having without hesitation answered that such a crime deserved death, Hyder replied, "I do not judge in that manner, for our laws are milder. Since they have made themselves English by engaging to serve them, their property shall be adjudged to belong to Englishmen; and themselves shall be thrown into prison till I make peace with that nation."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, he opened negotiations with the Portuguese. As a result of the agreement, the suspicion against the clergy and the Christians was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|1957|loc=N. 6, pp. 103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Hyder's regime, the Mangalorean Catholic community continued to flourish.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|1957|loc=N. 6, p. 105}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hyder's death in the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]] on 7 December 1782, the British captured the fort again. Hyder was succeeded by his son Tipu Sultan.&lt;ref name="sch63"&gt;{{harvnb|South Kanara District Gazetteer|1973|p=63|Ref=sch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tipu laid several assaults on the Mangalore fort until January 1784, all of which resulted in failure. The fort was finally delivered to Tipu when [[Siege of Mangalore|the British capitulated]] on 30 January 1784.&lt;ref name="sch64"&gt;{{harvnb|South Kanara District Gazetteer|1973|p=64|Ref=sch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tipu received highly exaggerated reports about the role of the Mangalorean Catholics and their help to the British in the Second Anglo-Mysore War.&lt;ref name="s116"&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|1957|loc=N. 6, p. 116}}&lt;/ref&gt; To minimise the British threat to his kingdom and in the ''Sultan-ul-Tawarikh'', due to "the rage of Islam that began to boil in his breast",&lt;ref name="jnp1"&gt;"In Tipu's own writings, he justified his action as arising from "the rage of Islam that began to boil in his breast" for something that the Portuguese had done centuries before."{{harvnb|Machado|1999|p=191|Ref=mac}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tipu banished the Mangalorean Catholic community from their lands, and imprisoned them at Seringapatam, the capital of his empire.&lt;ref name="s7"&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|1957|loc=N. 6, p. 117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The captivity of Mangalorean Catholics at Seringapatam, which began on 24 February 1784 and ended on 4 May 1799, remains the most disconsolate memory in their history.&lt;ref name="dajser"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Dungeon dwelling of Seringapatam.jpg|thumb|right|A dungeon at Seringapatam. Many Mangalorean Catholics who refused to embrace Islam were imprisoned in such dungeons.]]

According to the ''Barcoor Manuscript'', written in [[Kannada]] by a Mangalorean Catholic from [[Barkur|Barcoor]] after his return from Seringapatam, 20,000 of them (one-third) died on the march to Seringapatam due to hunger, disease, and ill treatment by the soldiers.&lt;ref name="gyu"&gt;{{harvnb|Farias|1999|loc=p. 74: "More than one third of the number succumbed before the party reached Seringapatam.

After arriving at Seringapatam, the Christian captives were made to forcibly embrace Islam, were tortured, or sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chetti|1897|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young men who refused to embrace Islam were disfigured by cutting their noses, upper lips, and ears.

===Language and literature===
[[File:Michael Lobo.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Lobo]] published the first genealogical encyclopaedia of the Mangalorean Catholic community in 1999.]]
{{main|Canara Konkani|Literature of Mangalorean Catholics}}

Mangalorean Catholics speak the [[Konkani language]], which they have retained as their mother tongue despite the migration; the language is central to the community's identity.&lt;ref name="buc24"/&gt; They speak a dialect known as Mangalorean Catholic Konkani, which the ''[[Ethnologue]]'' broadly identifies as the ''Mangalore'' dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=gom 
 |title=Ethnologue report for Konkani, Goan (ISO 639–3: gom)

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mangalorean Catholic dialect has [[Sanskrit]] influences, and preserves many features of the [[Maharashtri]], [[Shauraseni]], and [[Magadha|Magadhi]] dialects of [[Prakrit]].
It also liberally uses [[loanword]]s from the [[Tulu language|Tulu]] and [[Kannada language|Kannada]] languages.&lt;ref name="mir97"&gt;{{harvnb|Miranda|1977|p=[http://resources.metapress.com/pdf-preview.axd?code=jl2250500582hg17&amp;size=largest 247]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is written in the [[Kannada script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cardona|2003|p=731}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialect does not distinguish between the nouns of Kannada and Konkani and has developed into a language that is very practical for business.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Some Kannada rootwords which have disappeared from the Goan dialects due to the influence of Portuguese have re-entered the Mangalorean lexicon.&lt;ref name="mir97"/&gt; 350–400 Portuguese lexical items are found in the Mangalorean Catholic dialect, of which more than half are related to religious terminology. The influence of Portuguese syntax is only found in some sets of phrases and prayers which have come down from the pre-migration era.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abbi|Gupta|Kidwai|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tcfJY7kANo8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA53,M1 53]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mangalorean Catholic dialect is largely derived from the ''Bardeskaar'' ([[North Goa]]n) dialect and bears a good degree of [[mutually intelligible|intelligibility]] with the modern ''Bardeskaar'' dialect (spoken by North [[Christianity in Goa|Goan Christians]], North Goan Hindus, and [[South Goa]]n Hindus) and to a slightly lesser extent with the standard Konkani dialect.&lt;ref name="knk0687"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miranda|1978|pp=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consequently differs from the dialect spoken by the [[Goud Saraswat Brahmin]]s in South Canara, which is copiously derived and bears a good degree of intelligibility with the modern ''Sashtikaar'' (South Goan) dialect spoken by South Goan Christians and North Canara Konkani Hindus.&lt;ref name="knk0687"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bombay|Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain|Ireland Bombay Branch|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=K-_tQUYzIzwC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;dq=#PPA300,M1 300]|Ref=as}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is much closer to the dialects of the Goan Hindus than to that of the [[Goan Catholics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelley|Dimock|Kachru|1992|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian Jesuits who arrived in Mangalore in 1878, devoted themselves to the study and development of Konkani, and were thus responsible for the revival of the Konkani language in Mangalore.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|George|1992|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=m1R2Pa3f7r0C&amp;pg=PA210#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 210]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of their literature dates to 1883, when Angelus Francis Xavier Maffei, an Italian Jesuit, published the first ''An English–Konkani Dictionary'' in Mangalore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/02/02/stories/2007020212980400.htm|title=New English-Konkani dictionary ready|author=Nagesh Prabhu|date=2 February 2007|accessdate=7 September 2008|publisher=''[[The Hindu]]''|location=Chennai, India|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105190542/http://www.hindu.com/2007/02/02/stories/2007020212980400.htm|archivedate=5 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published a book on Konkani grammar in 1882, with a revised version in 1893.&lt;ref name="ds2"&gt;{{harvnb|D'Souza|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aAli0XqprNMC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Louis+Mascarenhas+Konkani&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CezrTIvJAoP54Aajnt24AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Louis%20Mascarenhas%20Konkani&amp;f=false,M1 4]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 the first Konkani periodical, ''Konknni Dirvem'' (Konkani Treasure), was published in Mangalore by Louis Mascarenhas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.daijiworld.com/news/news_disp.asp?n_id=32675&amp;n_tit=News+headlines |title= Rich Tributes Paid to Pioneer Konkani Poet Louis Mascarenhas |accessdate= 1 March 2008 |author= Melka Miyar |publisher= Daijiworld Media Pvt Ltd Mangalore |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090825221419/http://www.daijiworld.com/news/news_disp.asp?n_id=32675&amp;n_tit=News+headlines |archivedate= 25 August 2009 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular Konkani periodicals published in Mangalore include ''Raknno'' (Guardian) (1938) by Mons.

===Traditions and festivals===
Mangalorean Catholics have retained many Indian customs and traditions; these are especially visible during the celebration of a marriage.&lt;ref name="Saraswati"/&gt; Their culture is more traditional and Indian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larsen|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6jF4Q5jQWboC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA359,M1 359]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Portuguese traded quite frequently in Mangalore, and most of the priests arriving in the region were Portuguese,
there did not develop a community identified with Portugal and Portuguese culture.&lt;ref name="lar360"&gt;{{harvnb|Larsen|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6jF4Q5jQWboC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA360,M1 360]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mangalorean Catholics have no uniform rituals since they belong to both the patrilineal Brahmin stock and to the matrilineal non-Brahmin stock.&lt;ref name="sf7"&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their marriage rites share many similarities with the Shenvi sub-caste of the [[Goud Saraswat Brahmin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was mainly these pre-Christian marriage rites that the Portuguese found objectionable and prohibited during the Goan Inquisition.&lt;ref name="rod"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Roce''{{ref label|b|b|none}} ([[anointing]]) ceremony, conducted one or two days before a wedding, celebrates the last day of virginity of the bride and bridegroom and involves the parents' blessing of the bride and groom, who are anointed with ''roce'', a mixture of [[coconut milk]] and [[coconut oil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a cross is inscribed on the bride's forehead.&lt;ref name="rod"/&gt;&lt;ref name="catholicroce"&gt;{{cite web|last=D'Souza |first=Anil |title=Catholic Roce&amp;nbsp;–- Is it an Extinct Ceremony ? |url=http://www.daijiworld.com/chan/exclusive_arch.asp?ex_id=1123 |publisher=[[Daiji World|Daijiworld Media Pvt Ltd Mangalore]] |accessdate=12 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418183243/http://www.daijiworld.com/chan/exclusive_arch.asp?ex_id=1123 |archivedate=18 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Sa|1972|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage traditions include ''Soirik'' ([[betrothal]]),&lt;ref name="sar73"/&gt; exchange of ''Paan Pod''{{Ref label|c|c|none}} ([[betel leaves]]) during the marriage ceremony,&lt;ref name="sf18"&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; which known as ''Badalchen'' (changing hands; formal acceptance of the promise made by the bride's father to the bridegroom's father that he will give his daughter in marriage).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Sa|1972|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|d|d|none}}&lt;ref name="sar73"/&gt; The bride is adorned with the ''Sado'' (wedding ''[[sari]]'')&lt;ref name="sf19"/&gt; and ''Pirduk''{{Ref label|f|f|a}} (wedding necklace).&lt;ref name="sf19"&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other rites include the ''Onpnni'' (giving away the bride formally by the father or the guardian of the bride),&lt;ref name="dsa86"/&gt; ''Porthoponn'' (re-invitation to the bride's house),&lt;ref name="dsa86"&gt;{{harvnb|D'Sa|1972|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; and singing of ''Honvious'' (hymns).&lt;ref name="sar73"/&gt; Some non-marriage traditions include ''Novemjeevon'' (partaking of the food prepared from new corn) and ''Novem'' (blessing of new harvests).&lt;ref name="sar73"&gt;{{harvnb|Sardesai|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1YILeUD_oZUC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U3eRv7KiLopAMlVhQAf6RWu6jB6ww#PPA73,M1 73]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monti Fest.jpg|thumb|300px|A ''[[Monti Fest]]'' celebration near the Milagres Church in [[Hampankatta]], Mangalore]]

In addition to common Christian festivals like Christmas, [[Good Friday]], and Easter, the community celebrates many other festivals of religious and historical significance. ''[[Monti Fest]]'' is one of the major festivals, celebrated on 8 September. It combines the [[Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary]] and blessing of ''Novem'' (new crops). The festival derives its name from the [[Monte Mariano Church]] at Farangipet in South Canara, and was initiated by Fr. Joachim Miranda, a [[Goan Catholics|Goan Catholic]] priest at Farangipet, in 1763. Although Tipu Sultan destroyed the churches of Canara, he spared Monte Mariano Church in deference to the friendship of his father Hyder Ali with Fr. Miranda.&lt;ref name="escdemo"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Mangalorean Catholic wedding costumes.jpg|200px|thumb|A Mangalorean Catholic couple dressed in traditional wedding costumes. The bride is wearing a wedding ''Sari'' (''Sado''); while the groom is wearing a ''Todop'' (golden hem), ''Kutanv'' (coat), ''Pudvem'' (''[[dhoti]]''), and ''Urmaal'' (turban).]]

Mangalorean Catholic men traditionally wore long, loose-frilled, white or black coats known as ''Kutanv'' (similar to the Maratha loose coats with buttons), over a ''Zibbo'' (loose shirt), while the ''Pudvem'' (''dhoti''), a piece of unstitched cloth, usually around {{convert|7|yd}} long, was wrapped around the waist and the legs and knotted at the waist. The turban called ''Mundaas'' or ''Urmal'', were usually flattened like the ''Coorgi'' turbans.&lt;ref name="sf31"/&gt; It was a long white piece of cloth with a ''Todop'' (golden hem) tied around the head like a turban in a particular manner by which they could be easily identified as Catholics.&lt;ref name="sf31"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Souza|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aAli0XqprNMC&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Pudvem&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 9]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times however, this mode has changed. Only a few older people can be seen wearing this traditional dress on church-going occasions.&lt;ref name="sc119"&gt;{{harvnb|South Kanara District Gazetteer|1973|p=119|Ref=sc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before marriage, women used to wear a ''Kirgi'' (''sari'') and ''Baju'' (blouse). The ''Kirgi'' is a piece of cloth not longer than four feet, and about three feet wide. It was wrapped around the body from the waist down. A jacket with long sleeves called a ''Baju'', was used to cover the upper part of the body. This dress was a sign of the bride's virginity and was worn during the ''Ros'' ceremony.&lt;ref name="sf31"&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dsa77"&gt;{{harvnb|D'Sa|1972|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Kirgi'' was wrapped around the waist, but the end of the ''sari'' is not thrown over the shoulder.&lt;ref name="dsa77"/&gt; To wear the ''sari'' with its end thrown over the shoulder, known as ''Worl'', is the exclusive right of a married woman.&lt;ref name="sf40"&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Married women used to wear sarees the general way.&lt;ref name="sc120"&gt;{{harvnb|South Kanara District Gazetteer|1973|p=120|Ref=sc}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Salwar kameez]]'' is another form of popular dress for females. The Mangalorean Catholic bride's wedding ''sari'' is known as a ''Sado''.{{ref label|e|e|none}}&lt;ref name="sf32"&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually a red-coloured ''[[Banarasi|Banarasi sari]]'' which is made of finely woven silk and is decorated with elaborate engravings.&lt;ref name="sf19"/&gt; In olden days, the bride wore on her head a red cloth, three feet square. Gold ornaments were absent in those days: the bride went to the church dressed as a virgin girl. In modern times, the bride wears (in place of the ''Kirgi'') a red sari, but the end of the ''sari'' is not thrown over the shoulder; it is wrapped around the waist. The bride wears a few gold ornaments, some rings on the fingers, earrings, and at least two of the ''Dantoni'' (golden combs).&lt;ref name="sf32"/&gt; Other ornaments worn by the bride in the olden days included ''Kanti'', ''Chakrasar'', ''Kap'', ''Karap'', ''Mugud'', ''Kanto'', and ''Dantoni''.&lt;ref name="dsa77"/&gt;

[[File:Mangalorean Catholic sado.JPG|220px|thumb|left|A typical Mangalorean Catholic wedding ''sari'' (''sado'')]]

''Dantoni'' consist of two ordinary combs with the upper part of each one plated with gold; they are worn in the hair on both sides of the head over the ears. On the way to church the bride wears some white and red flowers stuck in the hair. In the centre of the forehead, a ''Bang'' (gold chain) was placed with a pendant.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Pirduk'' (''[[Mangalsutra]]''){{Ref label|f|f|b}} is a necklace made of black beads strung on gold wire as either as a single chain or double chain, with a connecting pendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larsen|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6jF4Q5jQWboC&amp;lpg=PA403&amp;dq=Goan%20Catholic%20Konkani&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 101]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This necklace is worn as long as the husband is alive; a widow is expected to take it off.&lt;ref name="sf40"/&gt; It is highly prized by women

Later, his dress consisted of a white loincloth with a red and gold hem (''todop''), a shirt with gold buttons and a coat (''Kutanv''), a shawl on the shoulders, and a towel (''Urmal'') on the head.&lt;ref name="sf31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dsa77"/&gt; The bridegroom wore a ''Chakrasar'' (neck chain) around his neck.

===Historical society===
[[File:Cajetan Lobo Prabhu.jpg|280px|right|thumb|A Mangalorean Catholic gentleman belonging to the ''Bamonn'' caste. ''Circa'' 1938.]]
Mangalorean Catholics retained the same caste system as their ancestors in Goa. They were mainly divided into four castes: ''[[Roman Catholic Brahmin|Bamonns]]'', ''[[Roman Catholic Kshatriya|Charodis]]'', ''Sudirs'', and ''Gaudis''.&lt;ref name="sf7"/&gt;

The biggest group were the ''Bamonns'', who were converts from the priestly [[Brahmin]] class.&lt;ref name="Mercury"/&gt; All Brahmin sub-castes such as the [[Goud Saraswat Brahmins]], [[Padye]]s, and [[Daivadnya]]s, especially the goldsmiths and a few merchants, were lumped into the Christian caste of ''Bamonn''.&lt;ref name="bhat"&gt;{{harvnb|Gomes|1987|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The descendants of Goud Saraswat converts comprised the majority of this caste.&lt;ref name="Mercury"/&gt; The ''Bamonns'' were further divided into other castes according to rank. In Mangalore, they were sub-divided into ''Sirudhegars'' (the highest class), ''Alhdhengars'', ''Cutdhnangars'', ''Dhivodegars'', ''Nathnolegars'', ''Sashragars'', ''Puruvargars'', and ''Maidhegars''. These names are taken from the villages to which they once belonged.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maffei|1885|p=[https://archive.org/stream/anenglishkonkan00bygoog#page/n730/mode/1up/search/sirudegar 155]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group constituted the landed gentry. In accordance with traditional Hindu law that allowed a Brahmin to practice any occupation except cultivation, the ''Bamonns'' refrained from cultivating their lands, and leased them to tenants.&lt;ref name="land"&gt;{{harvnb|Pinto|1999|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Charodis'', the second-largest group, were converts from the [[Kshatriya]] (warrior class) and [[Vaishya]] (merchant class) castes.&lt;ref name="sf7"/&gt; They were generally engaged in trade and commercial vocations.&lt;ref name="merchant"&gt;{{harvnb|Pinto|1999|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artisan converts formed the third-biggest group and were known as ''Sudirs'' (the Konkani word for [[Shudra]]s, which were the labour class).&lt;ref name="sf7"/&gt; They were workers and agricultural labourers engaged in service professions.&lt;ref name="merchant"/&gt; The converts from the fisher caste residing around [[Ullal]], Kuloor, and other places around the seacoast were called ''Gaudis'', and formed the fourth group.&lt;ref name="Mercury"/&gt; They cultivated the lands of the ''Bamonns'' and the high-caste Hindus.&lt;ref name="land"/&gt; Other minor castes included the ''[[Padval]]s'', whom historian Severine Silva assumes to be local [[Tulu Jains|Jain]] converts.&lt;ref name="Mercury"/&gt;

[[File:Pais Prabhu.JPG|300px|thumb|left|An extended Catholic family in Mangalore belonging to the ''Bamonn'' caste. ''Circa'' 1929.]]
The Mangalorean Catholics constituted a small community widely scattered across the South Canara district. Rather than being a closely knit and united group, the Goan Catholic immigrants and their progeny did not associate with the native Catholics on account of caste, origin, and language, and even among themselves were strongly divided by caste.&lt;ref name="sf6"/&gt; The Hindus, including the indigenous Brahmins (mostly belonging to the [[Shivalli Brahmins|Shivalli]], [[Havyaka Brahmin|Havyaka]], and [[Kota Brahmin|Kota]] sub-groups) and [[Bunt (community)|Bunts]] did not associate with the Catholics and would not admit them into their houses on account of their religion.&lt;ref name="Saraswati"/&gt; However, a close contact was kept by the Catholics with the Hindus of the same caste who were refugees from Goa. Catholics would invite their Hindu cousins to festivities such as birth celebrations, weddings, and funeral feasts. The Hindus accepted such invitations.&lt;ref name="Saraswati"/&gt; Unlike his Hindu counterpart, a high-caste Mangalorean Catholic did not consider himself polluted upon physical contact with a member of the lower caste, but members of different castes did not fraternise or invite each other home for dinner.&lt;ref name="Canon"/&gt;

Marriage between members of the various castes was not permitted, and such matches were strictly discouraged by the elders. For instance, a ''Bamonn'' boy would only marry a ''Bamonn'' girl and a ''Charodi'' boy would only marry a ''Charodi'' girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Bamonns'' and ''Charodis'' would invite neighbours and friends belonging to the ''Sudir'' and ''Gaudi'' castes to special occasions such as weddings and baptisms, although the latter would have to observe certain restrictions with regards to sitting and eating. The lower castes felt honoured if they were invited and usually accepted such invitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper castes usually did not attend the ceremonies of the lower castes, even if expressly invited.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Salvador Barboza.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sacristan]] of St. Lawrence Church, [[Moodubelle]], gives his blessings to his granddaughter during her ''Ros'' ceremony. ''Circa'' 1975.]]

It was difficult for the few priests who had accompanied the Christian emigrants to South Canara to look after them properly. Thus, the ''Gurkar'' system came into existence. ''Gurkars'' were Mangalorean Catholic men of good moral character who were selected as headmen in Christian settlements. They were entrusted with the social and religious supervision of the community.&lt;ref name="sf 9"/&gt; After migration, the only possible occupation of a Mangalorean Catholic was agriculture, since they were skilled farmers.&lt;ref name="Mercury"/&gt; Every farmer practised carpentry, but it was quite primitive and unskilled, and other crafts and industries were non-existent.&lt;ref name="sf16"&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|mass]] was celebrated in Latin; but the [[sermon]], the [[catechism]], and the explication of the mysteries were delivered to the congregation in Konkani.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The Oriental Herald|1824|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ihgYAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPA17,M1 17]|Ref=or}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parishes were grouped into deaneries called ''Varados''. Every parish was divided into wards, while [[Pastoral Council|Parish Council]]s were present in most parishes.&lt;ref name="dio159"/&gt; About 15 percent of the households in the parishes were literate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paths of mission in India today|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dzU9NyOycG4C&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=Mangalorean%20Catholics&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 160]|Ref=dio}}&lt;/ref&gt; A widow had to remain indoors, practically for the rest of her life. Since high-caste Hindu widows cannot remarry after the death of their husbands, the high-caste Christians too considered the remarriage of a widow as something unnatural. Canon law did allow remarriage for widows and therefore there was no direct prohibition for widows to remarry in the society of the Christians of South Canara. Few women had the courage to go against the strict conventions of their community. A widow who remarried was looked down upon, pitied, and shunned as unlucky. But she was not ill-treated or made an outcast, and no stigma was attached to her husband.&lt;ref name="Saraswati"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Canon"/&gt; Succession to property was practised as per the Hindu laws.&lt;ref name="Canon"&gt;{{harvnb|Pinto|1999|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Konkani [[pop (music)|pop music]] became popular after [[Indian Independence Movement|Indian Independence]] in 1947. Henry D'Souza and Helen D'Cruz are known for the Konkani love duet ''Kathrina'' in 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rodrigues|2009|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the love Ballad ''Garacho Divo'' (Lamp of the House) in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rodrigues|2009|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Wilfy Rebimbus' [[sonnet]] ''Mog Tuzo Kithlo Axelom'' (How I Have Loved Thee) from 1977 is popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rodrigues|2009|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Konkani plays, especially religious ones, were written and staged in Mangalore in the 20th century by prominent playwrights such as Pedru John D'Souza, Pascal Sequeira and Bonaventure Tauro.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.in"/&gt; The ''[[Ghumot|Ghumat]]'' was a popular musical instrument played especially during weddings.&lt;ref name="sf47"&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument has the form of an earthen pot but is open at both sides.

The tradition of ''Voviyo'' (wedding songs), sung by women during a ''Ros'', is important to this community. The procedure is that an elderly lady, usually the ''yejman'' (wife of the master of ceremonies, who is known as ''yejmani'') who knows the ''voviyos'', leads the song while the rest of the women sing along. Only women whose husbands are still living may sing. In ancient times, the wedding songs expressed very lofty sentiments and gave vent to the feelings of the people about the marriage partners and their families, invoking the blessing of God on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Fuchs|1965|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''Aprosachi vatli, kasgran petli, ruzai mai betli, hea rosalagim.''&lt;br /&gt;The ''Ros'' brass plate is made by brass smith, our Lady of Rosary is here at this ros ceremony.

''Dimbi ami galeam, santa kuru kadeam, kurpa ami magieam amchea Jezulagim.''&lt;br /&gt;Let us kneel, make sign of the cross, and pray for God's grace.

==Footnotes==
&lt;div&gt;
: '''a''' {{note label|a|a|none}} Most of the Christian soldiers in the [[Keladi Nayaka]] army belonged to the ''[[Roman Catholic Kshatriya|Charodi]]'' caste.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pinto|1999|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: '''b''' {{note label|b|b|none}} The ''Ros'' is a ceremony similar to the ''Tel'' ceremony performed by the Goan Hindus.&lt;ref name="ros"&gt;{{harvnb|da Silva Gracias|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TbZaZw216gMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 62]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tel'' is an auspicious ceremony during which the Hindu bride wears a yellow [[sari]], while ladies from the family would rub the body with [[turmeric]] and oil. They would apply it with the help of two leaves of a mango tree over the forehead, neck, chest, shoulder arms and legs of the bride.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|da Silva Gracias|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TbZaZw216gMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 57]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar pattern was followed wherein the Christian bride was smeared with turmeric paste, coconut milk, rice flour with the leaves of ''ambolim'' to make the skin smooth, fair and prepare the bride for marriage. In 1736, this practice was banned by the Holy Inquisition in Goa.&lt;ref name="ros"/&gt;
: '''c''' {{note label|c|c|none}} ''Bido'' is the small packet of pieces of [[areca nut]] wrapped into a betel leaf with the addition of several spices. ''Pan-pod'' is the same, but loosely placed on a plate, so that each guest can prepare his own pan. The areca nut, uncut, is called ''popal'', cut into small pieces it is ''pod''.&lt;ref name="sf18"/&gt;
: '''d''' {{note label|d|d|none}} In the past, [[Kanara|Canara]] was famous for its [[spices]]. And so, ''[[paan]]'' (betel leaf) and ''pod'' (areca nut cut into small pieces), the seed of the tropical palm ''[[Areca catechu]]'' were generously supplied on all festive occasions. The spices were not mixed with ''chuno'' ([[Quick lime]]). In fact, in every house a copper or brass plate was always kept ready for a ''pan-pod'' party. Whenever a guest arrived at the house, it was customary to offer him this plate with a fresh betel leaf just picked from the vine. A [[betel nut]] known as ''tobak'' or ''dumti'' (Tobacco) was prepared and placed on the brass plate.&lt;ref name="sf18"/&gt;
: '''e''' {{note label|e|e|none}} After the wedding was over, the ''sado'' was well preserved and worn only on high feast-days or for weddings. Sometimes, a particularly precious sado was handed down from mother to daughter and considered a valuable heirloom. The cost of a sado was reckoned in ''varahas''. Saris are known for their variety by special names, such as ''Katari'', ''Shilari'', ''Gulabi'', etc.&lt;ref name="sf19"/&gt; Both the ''Sado'' and ''Dharma sado'' were costly saris, while the ''Sado'' was the most expensive, the ''Dharma Sado'' was the second most expensive.&lt;ref name="dsa77"/&gt;
: '''f''' {{note label|f|f|a}}{{note label|f|f|b}} The Hindus call it ''[[mangalsutra]]'' or ''mangala-sutra'' (the auspicious necklace). It is the symbol of the married state.&lt;ref name="sf19"/&gt; In the olden days, the Mangalsutra was made of black glass beads strung on a thread made of the fibres of dried [[pineapple]] leaves.&lt;ref name="sf40"/&gt; The ordinary crude pattern of the pirduk was improved in the course of time. Later longish beads of gold were inserted between the black glass beads and a pendant was added. The earliest pendant was a round disk of silver. It was called ''thali''. Later it was changed into a golden pendant.&lt;ref name="sf20"/&gt;

'''Mary Lee''' (née Walsh) (14 February 1821 &amp;ndash; 18 September 1909) was an Irish-Australian [[suffragist]] and social reformer in [[South Australia]].

==Early life==
Mary Lee was born  in Ireland at Kilknock Estate, county Monaghan. She was married in 1844 to George Lee.  The couple had seven children however little more is known about her life in Ireland. Her son Ben moved to [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]].  When he fell ill in 1879, Lee and her daughter, Evelyn, immigrated to Adelaide as well. They travelled on the maiden voyage of the [[steamship]] ''Orient''. Her son died on 2 November 1880.

In 1883 Mary Lee became active in the ladies' committee of the Social Purity Society. The Society advocated changes to the law relating to the social and legal status of young women, advocating an end to [[child labour]] to protect girls from abuse and preventing them from becoming prostitutes or child brides. The group's success was a passage in the 1885 ''Criminal Law Consolidation Amendment Act'' that raised the [[age of consent]] from 13 to 16. Her first achievement was  a new law to protect young women, which made it illegal for a man to have sex with a girl under 16.

The Social Purity Society also was concerned with the working conditions of women. After the bill was passed in 1885 the group began campaigning for workers' rights. In December 1889 at a public meeting Lee proposed the formation of a women's [[trade union]]. [[The Working Women's Trades Union]] was founded in 1890, Mary Lee was the union's secretary for two years. In 1893 Lee attended the Trades and Labor Council meetings, served on the sub-committee which examined conditions in the clothing industry, and on the Distressed Women and Children's Committee which distributed clothes and food to the families hit by the [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]] of the 1890s.

On 13 July 1888 Lee, the [[Social Purity League]], and others met and formed the South Australian [[Women's Suffrage League]]. She was the League's co-honorary secretary and for six and half years she fought for women's suffrage. Her own letters and reports of her speeches show that she was an astute and logical woman, employing sound argument, wit and humour in her correspondence and public speaking. In 1889 she wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let husbands, brothers, fathers, be kept in mind that it is the duty of every free man to leave his daughters as free as his sons. -as women assist in maintaining Government they have a right to a say how and by whom they shall be governed. Nineteenth century civilisation has accorded to women the same political status as to the idiot and the criminal. Such is the basis of our reverence for the person of women and of our estimate of her work.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:J150W-statue-Lee-text.jpg|thumb]]
Lee was active in advocating the rights of the working class, publishing the following thoughts in ''[[The Barrier Miner]]'' in respect of the [[1892 Broken Hill miners' strike]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... Sir, this strike has one feature which renders it more profoundly interesting than any of its predecessors...which must secure it a prominent and distinguished page when the history of these colonies shall be written. It is that the [[Women's Brigade (Broken Hill)|women of Broken Hill]] are the first great body of working women who have raised their voices in united protest against the glaring injustice that ‘the present constitution will not allow them a voice in framing the laws ...'&lt;ref&gt;Bloodworth, S. (1996) The Rebel Women of Broken Hill in Militant Spirits, La Trobe University, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bills to grant women's suffrage were put forth in the South Australian parliament between 1889 and 1893, all failed. Spurred on by the grant of women's suffrage in New Zealand, Lee, the Social Purity League, the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] and the Democratic League travelled all over South Australia, which included the [[Northern Territory]] at the time, collecting signatures on a petition. On 23 August 1894 when the ''Adult Suffrage Bill'' was read in the South Australian parliament, the women presented the great petition. The petition contained 11,600 signatures, on paper sheets from all over the colony, that had been pasted together to make a roll 122 metres long. The bill passed on 18 December 1894, it granted women the right to vote and stand for parliament, and South Australia was the first legislation worldwide to do so.

Once women had the vote, Lee was active in voter education, encouraging women to enrol and vote. By her 75th birthday 60,000 women had enrolled to vote. In 1885 she was nominated to stand for parliament but refused.

She was appointed to the honorary position of the only female official visitor to the [[Lunatic Asylum]]s in 1896. During this latter part of her life, Lee struggled financially and had to sell her library. She continued to correspond with women in other Australian states where suffrage was not yet granted.

She died in 1909 from [[pleurisy]] following [[influenza]] and was buried with her son Ben.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14555">'''Monetization''' (also written '''monetisation''') is the process of converting or establishing something into [[legal tender]]. While it usually refers to the [[coin]]ing of currency or the printing of [[banknote]]s by [[central bank]]s, it may also take the form of a promissory currency.

The term "monetization" may also be used informally to refer to exchanging possessions for cash or cash equivalents, including selling a [[security interest]], charging fees for something that used to be free, or attempting to make money on goods or services that were previously unprofitable or had been considered to have the potential to earn profits. And [[data monetization]] refers to a spectrum of ways information assets can be converted into economic value. 

Still another meaning of "monetization" denotes the process by which the U.S. Treasury accounts for the face value of outstanding coinage.  This procedure can extend even to one-of-a-kind situations such as when the Treasury Department sold an extremely rare 1933 [[Double Eagle]]. The coin's nominal value of $20 was added to the final sale price, reflecting the fact that the coin was considered to have been issued into circulation as a result of the transaction.

==Promissory currency==

Such commodities as [[gold]], [[diamond]]s and [[emerald]]s have generally been regarded by human populations as having intrinsic value within that population based on their rarity or quality and thus provide a premium not associated with fiat [[currency]] unless that currency is "promissory". That is, the currency promises to deliver a given amount of a recognized [[commodity]] of a universally (globally) agreed-to rarity and value, providing the currency with the foundation of legitimacy or value.  Though rarely the case with paper currency, even intrinsically relatively worthless items or commodities can be made into money, so long as they are difficult to make or acquire.

==Debt monetization==
Debt monetization is the financing of government operations by the [[central bank]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If a nation's expenditure exceeds its revenues, it incurs a  [[government deficit]] which can be financed by the government [[treasury]] by 
*money it already holds (e.g. income or liquidations from a sovereign wealth fund)
*issuing new [[government bond|bonds]]

or by the central bank by
*money it creates ''[[wikt:de novo|de novo]]'' 

In the latter case, the central bank may purchase government bonds by conducting an [[open market operation|open market purchase]], i.e. by increasing the [[base money|monetary base]] through the [[money creation]] process. If government bonds that have come due are held by the central bank, the central bank will return any funds paid to it back to the treasury. Thus, the treasury may "borrow" money without needing to repay it. This process of financing government spending is called "monetizing the debt".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;The Economics of Money, Banking, and the Financial Markets 7ed, Frederic S. Mishkin&lt;/ref&gt;

In most high-income countries the government assigns [[Monetary sovereignty|exclusive power to issue]] its [[national currency]] to a [[central bank]]{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}, but central banks may be forbidden by law from purchasing debt directly from the government. For example, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (article 123) forbids EU central banks' direct purchase of debt of EU public bodies such as national governments. Their debt purchases have to be from the secondary markets. Monetizing debt is thus a two-step process where the government issues debt (Government bonds) to cover its spending and the central bank purchases the debt, holding it until it comes due, and leaving the system with an increased [[money supply|supply of money]]. 

=== Debt monetization and inflation ===

When government deficits are financed through debt monetization the outcome is an increase in the [[monetary base]], shifting the aggregate-demand curve to the right leading to a rise in the price level (unless the money supply is infinitely [[Elasticity (economics)|elastic]]).&lt;ref&gt;The Economics of Money, Banking, and the Financial Markets 7ed, Mishkin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/01/economics-platinum-coin-option The economics of the platinum coin option] ''[[The Economist]]'' January 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  When governments intentionally do this, they devalue existing stockpiles of fixed income cash flows of anyone who is holding assets based in that currency.  This does not reduce the value of floating or hard assets, and has an uncertain (and potentially beneficial) impact on some equities.  It benefits debtors at the expense of creditors and will result in an increase in the nominal price of real estate.  This wealth transfer is clearly not a [[Pareto distribution|Pareto]] improvement but can act as a stimulus to economic growth and employment in an economy overburdened by private debt.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  It is in essence a "tax" and a simultaneous redistribution to debtors as the overall value of creditors' fixed income assets drop (and as the debt burden to debtors correspondingly decreases).  If the beneficiaries of this transfer are more likely to spend their gains (due to lower income and asset levels) this can stimulate demand and increase liquidity.  It also decreases the value of the currency - potentially stimulating exports and decreasing imports - improving the [[balance of trade]].  Foreign owners of local currency and debt also lose money. Fixed income creditors experience decreased wealth due to a loss in spending power.
This is known as "[[inflation tax]]" (or "inflationary debt relief").  Conversely,
tight monetary policy which favors creditors over debtors even at the expense of reduced
economic growth can also be considered a wealth transfer to holders of fixed assets
from people with debt or with mostly human capital to trade (a "deflation tax").

A deficit can be the source of sustained inflation only if it is persistent rather than temporary, and if the government finances it by creating money (through monetizing the debt), rather than leaving bonds in the hands of the public.&lt;ref&gt;The Economics of Money, Banking, and the Financial Markets 7ed, Mishkin&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revenue from business operations ==
In some industry sectors such as [[high technology]] and [[marketing]], monetization is a [[buzzword]] for adapting non-revenue-generating assets to generate revenue. Web sites and mobile apps that do generate revenue are often monetized via advertisements, subscription fees or (in the case of mobile) in-app purchases. In the music industry, monetization happens when a recording artist puts a video on the Internet and the platform where it appears shows advertisements before, during, or after the video. For each public viewing, the advertising revenue is shared with the artist or others who hold rights to the video content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Plain &amp; Simple Guide to Music Publishing|last=Wixen|first=Randall W.|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=2005|isbn=978-1-4803-5462-3|location=home|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previously free product may have premium options added thus becoming [[freemium]].

Failure to monetize web sites due to an inadequate [[revenue model]] was a problem that caused many businesses to fold during the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com bust]].  [[David Sands]], CTO for Citibank Equity Research, affirmed that failure to achieve monetization of the Research Analysts' models as the reason the de-bundling of Equity Research has never taken hold.

==Monetization of non-monetary benefits==

Monetization is also used to refer to the process of converting some benefit received in non-monetary form (such as milk) into a monetary payment. The term is used in social welfare reform when converting in-kind payments (such as [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]] or other free benefits) into some "equivalent" cash payment. From the point of view of economics and efficiency, it is usually considered better to give someone a monetary equivalent of some benefit than the benefit (say, a liter of milk) in kind.

* '''Inefficiency''': in the latter situation people who may not need milk cannot get something of equivalent value (without subsequently trading or selling the milk).
* '''[[Black market]] growth''': people who need something other than milk may sell it. In many circumstances, this action may be illegal and considered fraudulent. For example, Moscow pensioners (see below for details) often give their personal cards that allow free usage of local transport to relatives who use public transport more frequently.
* '''Changes on the market''': supply of milk to the market is reduced by the amount distributed to the privileged group, so the price and availability of milk may change.
* '''Corruption''': firms that should give this benefit have an advantage as they have guaranteed consumers and the quality of the goods supplied is controlled only administratively, not by market competition. So, bribes to the body that choose such firms and/or maintain control can take place.

===Russian social welfare monetization of 2005===

In 2005, Russia transformed most of its in-kind benefits into monetary compensation.

Before this reform there were a large system of preferences: free/reduced price of travels on local transport, free supply of drugs, free health resort treatment, etc. for diverse categories of society: military personnel, the disabled, and separately, persons disabled due to [[World War II]], [[Chernobyl liquidators]], inhabitants of [[Siege of Leningrad|Leningrad during the siege]], former political prisoners, and for all ''pensioners'' (that is, women 55+, men 60+). This system was a legacy of the Soviet Union, but it was heavily extended by populist laws passed by central and regional authorities during the 1990s.

By the law 122-ФЗ of 22 August 2004, this system was converted into cash payments by various means:
* abolition of preference, compensated by raising of wage (e.g. free use of local transport for military personnel) or pension (e.g. different preferences for Chernobyl liquidators)
* for the three most important preferences (free local transport, 50%-price suburban rail transport, free supply of drugs): a choice between the preference and some extra money.

The main causes of friction in the reform were the following:
* technical and bureaucratic problems (e.g. for usage of the 50% discount for suburban rail transport, a person would need to present a paper from the local State Pension Fund office stating that he/she doesn't choose monetary compensation);
* separation of all preference-recipients into ''federal'' and ''regional'' according to the body authorizing the preference. The largest group &amp;mdash; pensioners &amp;mdash; was regional, and this caused most of the problems:
** In poor regions, financial pressure caused the local government to abolish these preferences with little or no compensation to the former recipients.
** Even if the preferences were retained, they would apply only to pensioners of the region in question. Thus, pensioners from the [[Moscow Oblast|Moscow ''Oblast'' (administrative region)]], for example, could not freely use the metro and buses in [[Moscow]] proper, because these are two different local governments. Later, most of these problems would be solved by a series of bi-lateral agreements between neighboring regions.

A wave of protests emerged in various parts of Russia in the beginning of 2005 as this law started to take effect. The government responded with measures that eventually addressed the most pressing of the protesters' concerns (raising of compensations, normalization of bureaucratic mechanisms, etc.).

The long-term effects of the monetization reform varied for different groups. Some people received compensation in excess of the services they had previously received (e.g. in rural areas without any local transport, the free transport benefit was of little value), while others found the compensation to be insufficient to cover the cost of the benefits they had previously depended on. Transport companies and railroads have benefitted from monetization as they now collect higher revenue from the use their services by pensioners who had previously ridden at the government's expense. (In some regions, more than half of the passengers formerly did not pay for municipal transport, but the government did not compensate the transport companies for the full fare of these passengers.) Effects on the medical system are controversial. Doctors and nurses have to fill out many forms in order to receive compensation from the government for services provided to pensioners, thus reducing the time that they have to provide medical services.

===United States agricultural policy===
In United States agricultural policy, "[[Monetization of U.S. in-kind food aid|monetization]]" is a [[Public Law 480|P.L. 480]] provision (section 203) first included in the [[Food Security Act of 1985]] (P.L. 99-198) that allows private voluntary organizations and cooperatives to sell a percentage of donated P.L. 480 commodities in the recipient country or in countries in the same region.  Under section 203, private voluntary organizations or cooperatives are permitted to sell (i.e., monetize) for local currencies or dollars an amount of commodities equal to not less than 15% of the total amount of commodities distributed in any fiscal year in a country.  The currency generated by these sales can then be used:  to finance internal transportation, storage, or distribution of commodities; to implement development projects; or to invest and with the interest earned used to finance distribution costs or projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition - Order Code 97-905] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810044532/http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf |date=10 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2871">{{Arab culture}}
'''''Nasīb''''' ({{lang-ar|النسيب}}) is an Arabic literary form, 'usually defined as an erotic or amatory prelude to the type of long poem called a ''[[Qasida|qaṣīdah]]''.'&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Johnstone, 'Nasīb and Mansöngur', ''The Journal of Arabic Literature'', 3 (1972), 90-95 (p. 90).&lt;/ref&gt; However, although at the beginning of the form's development ''nasīb'' meant 'love-song', it came to cover much wider kinds of content:&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Johnstone, 'Nasīb and Mansöngur', ''The Journal of Arabic Literature'', 3 (1972), 90-95 (p. 93).&lt;/ref&gt; 'The ''nasīb'' usually is understood as the first part of the ''qaṣīdah'' where the poet remembers his beloved. In later ages the ''nasīb'' stood alone, and in that sense the meaning came to be understood as erotic and love poetry.'&lt;ref&gt;Wahab Alansari, ''An Anthology of Arabic Poetry'', rev. edn (Seattle: Academy of Languages, 2010), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early and prominent examples of the ''nasīb'' appear in the ''[[Mu'allaqat|Mu'allaqāt]]'' of the sixth-century poets [[Antarah ibn Shaddad]] and [[Imru' al-Qais]]. To quote from Imru' al-Qais's ''Mu'allaqah'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Stay! let us weep, while memory tries to trace&lt;br&gt;
The long-lost fair one's sand-girt dwelling place;&lt;br&gt;
Though the rude winds have swept the sandy plain,&lt;br&gt;
Still some faint traces of that spot remain.&lt;br&gt;
My comrades reined their coursers by my side,&lt;br&gt;
And "Yield not, yield not to despair" they cried.&lt;br&gt;
(Tears were my sole reply; yet what avail&lt;br&gt;
Tears shed on sands, or sighs upon the gale?)&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Johnstone, 'Nasīb and Mansöngur', ''The Journal of Arabic Literature'', 3 (1972), 90-95 (p. 92), quoting [[William Alexander Clouston|W. A. Clouston]], ''Arabian Poetry for English Readers'' (Glasgow: [n. pub.], 1881), p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One prominent collection of self-standing ''nasīb''s (not included in a ''qaṣīdah'') is [[Ibn Arabi|Muḥyī al-Dīn Ibn al-ʿArabī]]'s ''[[Tarjumān al-Ashwāq]]'', a collection of sixty-one ''nasīb''s.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sells, ''Stations of Desire: Love Elegies from Ibn al-ʿArabī and New Poems'' (Jerusalem: Ibis Editions, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nepalis in Qatar''' are migrants from [[Nepal]] to [[Qatar]], mostly [[migrant worker]]s and permanent residents, as well as their locally born descendants.  As of May 2017, 400 thousand [[Nepali people|Nepali Citizen]]s lived in [[Qatar]] as migrant workers, Nepal is second largest expatriate community in Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

Many workers from Nepal are hired to work on the construction of stadiums and railways that are being designed for the [[FIFA World Cup|2022 FIFA World Cup]] to be held in Qatar. According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'', due to the terrible working conditions in Qatar, a Nepali worker dies every other day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3646505/world-cup-qatar-nepalese-worker-dying-soccer-football/|title=2022: Soccer's Deadly World Cup|last=Liljas|first=Per|website=TIME.com|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it has been alleged all deaths of Nepali workers in Qatar to the FIFA World Cup 2022, no such deaths have been reported in actual working sites related to the mega event.

==Overview==
Qatar is one of the favorite destinations for Nepali job aspirants who are mostly employed in construction works. All unqualified jobs are done by foreigners especially the Nepalis, who, nowadays, are the most sought after compared to Indians or other nationalities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phalano.com/?p=704: The life of the Nepalese in Qatar]&lt;/ref&gt; About 9,650 Nepali nationals arrived in Qatar in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=412062&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=36&amp;parent_id=16: More Nepali workers coming to Qatar: envoy]&lt;/ref&gt; The Nepalese workers have a reputation of being hardworking, honest, cheap and not prone to complaining. According to the former Nepalese ambassador to Qatar, Surynath Mishra, "Nepali migrant workers have the lowest per capita income in Qatar." According to the ambassador, they lack of education and technical skills mean that "They get exploited the most out of all the migrant workers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/09/asia/qatar-nepali-migrant-workers-deaths/index.html|title=A migrant worker's journey ends with a coffin|last=Pokharel|first=Sugam|website=CNN|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been a steady increase in the number of Nepalese expatriates coming to Qatar to take up employment. There are currently about 100 executives from Nepal in Qatar. A growing number of employers in Qatar are showing more interest hiring engineers, accountants, hotel and travel professionals from Nepal.

==Issues==
A major concern among the Nepalese officials in Qatar is the rise of deaths of Nepalese workers. Nepalese migrants building the infrastructure to host the 2022 World Cup have died at a rate of one every two days in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/23/qatar-nepal-workers-world-cup-2022-death-toll-doha: Nepalese migrants died at the rate of one every two days in 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nepalese Ambassador Suryanath Mishra, Two-third of the deaths are caused by stress because they are cheated by employment agencies and his embassy receives about 20 complaints each day from Nepalese victims of such fraud and that about 10 Nepalese return to their home country each day from Qatar because of such scams. The [[International Trade Union Confederation]] estimated that the worker death toll could hit 4,000 (nine deaths were associated with the last two World Cups, in [[Brazil]] and [[South Africa]]) before the 2022 World Cup begins. Nepalese workers in Qatar are forced to work 10- to 14-hour work days, often in extreme heat, with four hours of sleep, and live in cramped accommodations with poor sanitation. Many have gone into debt just to get to Qatar and frequently have to work overtime to make ends meet. Some make only one-third of the money that they’re initially promised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/nepalese-workers-bear-cost-of-qatars-world-cup-ambition/article24825803/|title=Nepalese workers bear brunt of Qatar’s World Cup ambition|website=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 a change.org petition began entitled, “End slavery of Nepalese migrant workers in Qatar!” The petition called on the government of Qatar to make specific changes to its migrant worker policy, specifically regarding the country’s Nepali workers. Among the demands were:&lt;ref&gt;"End Slavery of Nepalese Migrant Workers in Qatar." Change.org. Retrieved 2016-06-07.&lt;/ref&gt;
# “To ensure humane working conditions to all migrant workers in Qatar. Hailing from the temperate Himalayas, Nepalese migrant workers face a high probability of developing complications toward the 100+ degree Fahrenheit desert heat they work in (often for 12+ hours/day non stop).”
# “To allow migrant workers to leave their jobs at will as in any other developed nation.”
# “To pay migrant workers a fair and "liveable" wage.”
# “To provide safe working conditions on construction sites.”
In 2015, the Nepalese in Qatar made headlines all over the world when, after an [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|earthquake in Nepal]] killed 8,000 people, Qatar refused to let their Nepalese workers leave to attend the funerals of their family members in Nepal. It was after this moment that the government in Kathmandu publicly criticized FIFA for the first time, insisting that the organization should use its leverage to pressure Qatar into improving working conditions for the 1.5 million migrants employed in Qatar as part of the World Cup construction frenzy. [[Tek Bahadur Gurung]], Nepal’s labour minister, said: “After the earthquake of 25 April, we requested all companies in Qatar to give their Nepalese workers special leave and pay for their air fare home. While workers in some sectors of the economy have been given this, those on World Cup construction sites are not being allowed to leave because of the pressure to complete projects on time.” He further added that the workers have, “lost relatives and their homes and are enduring very difficult conditions in Qatar. This is adding to their suffering.” The labor minister said that conditions for Nepalese workers in Qatar would not change unless FIFA and their sponsors put pressure on the small gulf state. The Nepali government estimates that around $4bn is sent home to Nepal every year by expatriates who work in the [[Persian Gulf]] region. This number accounts for nearly 20% of the country’s gross domestic product, and is money that would ultimately play an important role in rebuilding Nepal after the two earthquakes. The government of Nepal even offered to pay for the workers’ flights home to attend funeral services but the Qatari companies would not allow them bereavement leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/24/qatar-denies-nepalese-world-cup-workers-leave-after-earthquakes|title=Qatar refuses to let Nepalese workers return to attend funerals after quake|last=Chaudhary|first=Vivek|date=2015-05-23|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2015/05/world-cup-qatar-nepal-earthquake-soccer|title=Qatar is treating its World Cup workers like slaves: Nepal earthquake edition|website=Mother Jones|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/nepali-minister-blasts-qatar-fifa-over-treatment-world-cup-migrant-workers-1936125|title=Nepali Minister Blasts Qatar, FIFA, Over Treatment Of World Cup Migrant Workers|date=2015-05-24|website=International Business Times|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, more than 40 migrant Nepali workers based in Qatar were arrested by Qatari police and sent to the deportation center. The workers had been seeking justice for a year against their employer who had denied them regular payments. According to one Nepali worker, the police came into the labor camp where the workers are housed at midnight to arrest them: “The police arrested all our friends who were sleeping at the camp … Those who were not in the camp escaped the arrest.”  Prior to their arrest, the workers had issued lawsuits against their employer Metal Farming Centre including at the High Court and Supreme Court of Qatar because they had not been paid in 15 months. The company hired 118 construction workers out of which 88 were Nepal is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2015-10-30/three-dozen-migrant-nepali-workers-arrested-in-qatar.html|title=Three dozen migrant Nepali workers arrested in Qatar|website=kathmandupost.ekantipur.com|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, when Nepalese workers come to Qatar, they have to pay fees to recruitment officers in Nepal including: processing fees, visa fees, and airplane tickets. This means that Nepali workers arrive in Qatar in a massive amount of debt before they even begin working. In 2016, [[Narayan Kaji Shrestha]], head of the Unified Communist Party of Nepal, went to Qatar and asked the Qatari government to assist in a plan to minimize processing fees for laborers by monitoring the companies that hire Nepali workers and by helping to implement a “free ticket, free visa” system. In Qatar it is illegal to charge recruitment fees, however the practice exists in Nepal. A 2014 report commissioned by the Qatar Foundation showed that recruitment fees for workers average $1,300.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dohanews.co/help-end-exploitation-of-nepali-expats-official-asks-qatar-government/|title=Help end exploitation of Nepali expats, official asks Qatar government - Doha News|date=2016-04-17|website=Doha News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open Space Technology''' ('''OST''') is a method for organizing and running a meeting or multi-day conference, where participants have been invited in order to focus on a specific, important task or purpose. OST is a participant-driven process whose agenda is created by people attending. At the end of each OST meeting, a document is created summarizing the work of the group. The OST method is based upon work, beginning in the 1980s, by Owen Harrison. It was one of the top ten [[organization development]] tools cited between 2004 and 2013.&lt;ref name="OD"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://business.inquirer.net/204420/an-updated-definition-of-organizational-development |title=An updated definition of organizational development |last=Abadesco |first=Enrique V., Jr. |date=December 20, 2015 |website=business.inquirer.net |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406162800/https://business.inquirer.net/204420/an-updated-definition-of-organizational-development |archive-date=April 6, 2016 |dead-url=no |accessdate=July 18, 2018 |quote=A cursory review of the top ten OD topics, drawn from contents of the OD Practitioner (the quarterly publication of the US-based OD Network) from 2004-2013 reveal the following: Transformation and change; Coaching; Consulting practice; Diversity and inclusion; Appreciative Inquiry; Strategic management; Balanced scorecard approach; Teams; Complexity theory; Dialogic and large group interventions such as World Café by Juanita Brown and Open Space by Harrison Owen and; Leadership development |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
Harrison Owen, an Episcopal priest and [[Civil Rights]] activist, developed the idea of OST in the 1980s, based on his experience that coffee breaks and other unorganized encounters were the most productive parts of formal meetings.&lt;ref name="NYT1994"&gt; {{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/business/round-table-meetings-with-no-agendas-no-tables.html |title=Round-Table Meetings With No Agendas, No Tables |last=Deutsch |first=Claudia H |work=NYT |quote=An Episcopal priest and self-described civil rights activist, he held various governmental posts before becoming an organizational consultant 15 years ago. And he developed the concept of "open space" meetings -- where attendees break into ad hoc groups to discuss anything they think is germane -- after years of hearing people wax eloquent about the good experiences they had at meetings outside of the prearranged sessions. |date=April 1, 2018 |accessdate=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Owen was considered by many large corporations to be one of several New Age consultants whose methods might encourage employee participation and interest in company problems.&lt;ref name="NYT1988"&gt; {{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/25/magazine/scenario-for-a-new-age.html |title=Scenario for a new age |last=Cook |first=Karen |work=NYT |quote=Harrison Owen belongs to a new wave of consultants whose ideas are winning acceptance at some of the nation's largest corporations, including Polaroid, General Motors, TRW and Procter &amp; Gamble. The consultants march under various flags - some are known as New Age consultants, others as transformational technologists or human resources specialists - but they all emphasize the importance of realizing each employee's potential. |date=September 25, 1988 |accessdate=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central elements==
=== Self-organization ===
[[File:NASA Open Space 2 Innovate.jpg|thumb|Open Space meeting at [[NASA Goddard Space Flight Center]]]]

"Open space" meetings are called "self-organizing" because, even though all participants have been invited by meeting sponsor and charged with addressing a pre-chosen theme, the agenda and organization of further discussions are created by the participants.

An "open space" meeting usually will start with short introductions by the sponsor and a single facilitator.  The sponsor introduces the purpose; the facilitator explains the "self-organizing" process that is called "open space." Throughout the process, the ideal facilitator is described as being "fully present and totally invisible", "holding a space" for participants to self-organize, rather than managing or directing the conversations.&lt;ref name=OST&gt;{{cite book |last=Owen |first=Harrison |title=Open space technology : a user's guide |publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers |publication-place=San Francisco, Calif |year=2008 |isbn=9781576754764 |oclc=897008244 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/open-space-technology-a-users-guide/oclc/897008244/viewport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outcomes ===

Because the agenda of an Open Space meeting is emergent, it is impossible to know exactly what is going to be addressed during the meeting.  That said, there are several important outcomes that are specifically built into the process, and some other outcomes that can be built in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openspaceworld.org/wp2/what-is|title=What Is Open Space Technology?|work=OpenSpaceWorld.ORG|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518200725/http://openspaceworld.org/wp2/what-is/|archivedate=2015-05-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of an open space meeting, notes on the proceedings are usually compiled into a document that is distributed physically or electronically to all participants. Good documentation design is vital for ideas, suggestions, discourse, and improvements; it is part of the pre-work to make a good design.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Alternatives to OST==

Several other approaches to meeting organization share one or more features with OST. For example, several approaches other than OST are often called [[unconference|"unconferences"]], e.g. [[FooCamp]] and [[BarCamp]]. Both FooCamp and BarCamp are participant-driven, like OST, but neither is organized around a pre-set theme or aimed at solving a problem. The first Foo Camp was organized by [[Tim O'Reilly]] and Sara Winge; because Sara had been a student of Harrison Owen, many elements similar to OST are used in Foo Camp.&lt;ref name="Humboldt"&gt; {{Cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/true-inventor-unconference-tim-o-reilly/ |title=The True Inventor of the Unconference |last=O'Reilly |first=Tim |publisher=LinkedIn |quote=Sara based the design of Foo Camp in part on the "Open Space" work of Harrison Owen from 1985, who is widely credited with developing the concept. However, Sara just discovered that Alexander von Humboldt, one of the world's greatest scientists, pioneered the idea nearly 200 years ago, in 1828! |date=March 8, 2018 |accessdate=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[design sprint]] (a meeting technique related to [[design thinking]] and pioneered by [[GV (company)|Google Ventures]]) is similar to OST in that participants are invited by an organizer to work collaboratively on solving a problem, with the help of a facilitator who is trained in running such meetings. All participants are asked to contribute ideas toward what the problem is and how to solve it, but in a design sprint the facilitator is not invisible but in charge, guiding participants through a (typically) five-day process whose output includes a prototype part-solution and a user-test by some typical "customers."&lt;ref name="Knapp"&gt; {{Cite web |url=https://www.thesprintbook.com/how/ |title=The Design Sprint |last=Knapp |first=Jake |work=The Sprint Book |quote=On Friday, you'll show your prototype to five customers in five separate, 1:1 interviews. Instead of waiting for a launch to get perfect data, you'll quick-and-dirty answers to your most pressing questions right away. |accessdate=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some meeting organizers use Open Space techniques in combination with other methods, to avoid what they see as "shortcomings" of OST, for example an atmosphere that is potentially unfriendly for introverts.&lt;ref name="iied"&gt; {{Cite web |url=http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/G02981.pdf |work=Participatory Learning and Action 53: Tools for influencing power and policy|title=Integrating open space 16 technology and dynamic facilitation (PLA 53)|last=Howard |first=Phil|publisher=IIED |quote=Open space technology is a very successful participatory process, but it has two potential shortcomings: it is difficult to produce documentation of discussions in meetings lasting less than two days, and the process does not always encourage empathic listening among participants. Integrating open space with another participatory process, dynamic facilitation, could address these weaknesses when modest additional resources are available. |date=2005 |accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Critique"&gt; {{Cite web |url=https://www.conferencesthatwork.com/index.php/event-design/2012/03/a-short-critique-of-open-space/ |title=A short critique of Open Space |last=Segar |first=Adrian |publisher=Conferences That Work |quote=Open Space session topics are determined by individuals who stand up in front of the entire group and announce their chosen topic. Generally, this is much easier for extroverts, who have few difficulties speaking to a group extemporaneously, than introverts who tend to shun such opportunities. The end result is that introverts are largely silent during the opening process, and the subsequent Open Space sessions are biased towards those proposed and often dominated by a comfortably-vocal minority. |date=March 28, 2012 |accessdate=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France in November 1919, a group of [[World War I]] aviators started a drinking club called "The American Flying Club", and re-convened in New York City only to be barred from their clubhouse by the bailiff. In January 1921, a subset of that group, some ten to twenty aviators, began meeting fairly regularly on Monday nights in New York City at Marta, an Italian restaurant located at 75 Washington Place in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood. Harold Hersey, the editor of ''Aces High'' magazine, ironically called the group the Quiet Birdmen because they were so boisterous.&lt;ref name=FlyingDutchman/&gt; At one meeting, reporter Steve Hannigan noticed the jocular group, and visited again the next week, bringing a sketch artist. Hannigan wrote up a feature story about the group, accompanied by a sketch—the first public information about the group. The attendees that night were [[Harry Bruno]], S. H. MacKeon, Wallace James, Richard R. "Dick" Blythe, Earle D. Osborn, Charles S. "Casey" Jones, Harold T. "Slim" Lewis, Ernest Loftquis, Paul G. Zimmerman, Donald Mcllhenny, Ladislas d'Orcy, Richard H. DePew Jr, George Hubbard, R. B. C. Noorduyn, John (Jack) Bishop and J. E. Whitbeck.&lt;ref name=Bruno&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earlyaviators.com/ebruno.htm |title=Harry Augustine Bruno |publisher=Early Aviators |accessdate=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the group grew too large,&lt;ref name=Jardur&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jardur.com/secret-order-of-the-quiet-birdmen/ |title=Quiet Birdmen |publisher=Jardur Watches |accessdate=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or because of the noise bothering other patrons, the management at Marta stopped them from meeting there.&lt;ref name=FlyingDutchman&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buehlfield.info/clubs-honors-recognition/qb-ox5-clubs |title=QB &amp; OX5 Clubs |publisher=Flying Dutchman |accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent meetings were held in a different location each time, often a restaurant. Membership in the 1920s cost one dollar and lasted until death.&lt;ref name=NYC1928&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1928/01/07/1928_01_07_009_TNY_CARDS_000176319 |last=Thurber |first=James |authorlink=James Thurber |work=The New Yorker |title=The Talk Of The Town: 'Beyond Keewee and Modock' |date=January 7, 1921 |accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s the emblem of the club was created: a blue shield with the letters QB in silver, the shield flanked by silver wings. In 1938, the club's meetings settled into the building owned by the [[Architectural League of New York]].&lt;ref name=Jardur/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lindsay/&gt;

Harvey Mummert, vice president and chief engineer of Mercury Aircraft, has been credited as co-founder of the club.&lt;ref name=Henderson/&gt; Early members Bruno and Blythe started a public relations firm in 1923 and in 1927 they became known for promoting [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s solo trans-Atlantic flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2r2YAex_-0EC&amp;pg=PA132 |page=132 |last=Cohen |first=Charles D. |title=The Seuss, the whole Seuss, and nothing but the Seuss: a visual biography of Theodor Seuss Geisel |publisher=Random House Digital |year=2004 |isbn=0-375-82248-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindbergh was made a member of the Quiet Birdmen.&lt;ref name=FlyingDutchman/&gt; Unusually, a former combat foe was invited to join the club: [[Ernst Udet]], the highest-scoring German [[flying ace]] to survive World War I. Known as a fun-loving playboy, Udet performed aerobatics at the [[National Air Races]] in Cleveland in 1931 and '32, Los Angeles in '33, and again in Cleveland in '38. While visiting the U.S., Udet befriended Lindbergh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Air Line Pilot |last=Gurney |first=Harlan "Bud" |work= |publisher=Air Line Pilots Association |year=1977 |volume=46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eddie Rickenbacker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= |last=Haymes |first=Edward R. |work=Theatrum mundi: essays on German drama and German literature dedicated to Harold Lenz on his seventieth birthday, September 11, 1978 |year=1980 |publisher=W.

Kimber |year=1979 |isbn=0-7183-0067-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of New York, other Quiet Birdmen regional groups, or hangars, were formed. Before 1938, the club had a strict agreement against having a constitution, by-laws, dues, assessments, or club officers. No business was to be conducted, and no sales. Only male aviators were allowed to join, not female aviators or "Keewees" (non-flyers).&lt;ref name=Jardur/&gt; At the Cleveland Air Races in 1938, the QBs adopted a slightly more formal arrangement: a Board of Governors would be composed of one member from each hangar, and this board would choose an Executive Committee. Each regional hangar was to select a Key Man to handle club business. A year later, the group settled upon a QB Code of Procedure which described the structure of the club.&lt;ref name=Jardur/&gt; During [[World War II]] in London, England, a temporary hangar was formed in 1943 for club members posted to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fitzmaurice.info/jmcf.html |title=Col. James M. Christopher Fitzmaurice |publisher=Origins of the Fitzmaurice Families |last=Fitzmaurice |first=John A. |accessdate=July 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718101644/http://www.fitzmaurice.info/jmcf.html |archivedate=July 18, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The club's national Code of Procedure was modified again in 1953.&lt;ref name=Jardur/&gt;

In addition to the still existing New York Hangar, other early Hangars, originally called "leantos" to the original New York Hangar, had been formed.  Currently Hangars are formed independently and exist in [[Washington DC]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], [[Wayne, New Jersey|Wayne]], [[San Francisco Bay Area]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], Palomar in [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]], [[Oxnard, California|Oxnard]]/[[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[Palm Desert, California|Palm Desert]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]], [[Seattle]], North Cascade in northern [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]], Dallas, Houston, [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and Greenville [[South Carolina|in South Carolina]], [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]], [[Honolulu]], [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]], [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]], [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]], [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], [[Indiana]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Tampa Bay]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Melbourne, Florida|Melbourne]], [[Venice, Florida|Venice]], [[Stuart, Florida|Stuart]], [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], [[New Orleans]], [[Cape Cod]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]], [[Chicago]], [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming|Jackson Hole]], [[Boston]], [[Somerville, New Jersey|Somerville]], [[Hilton Head]], [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]], [[Denver]], [[Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania|Lehigh Valley]], [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], and [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Shreveport]], [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], [[Salt Lake City]], Pensacola, [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], and perhaps other cities throughout the US.

==Activities==
Depending on its location, QB regular activities generally reflect the age of its members. Typical QB get-togethers start with a silent toast to deceased members, glasses raised to the west in keeping with an old pilot's expression euphemistically referring to death as having "Gone West." Food and drink are served, and perhaps a talk or other program is given. Off-color jokes are plentiful. Occasionally semi-nude female entertainment has been seen at some of the meetings, especially the Wing Dings, which are larger parties held in late spring or summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flyingmag.com/martha-lunken/unusual-attitudes-name-i-wont-utter |last=Lunken |first=Martha |title=Unusual Attitudes: A Name I Won't Utter |work=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |date=March 11, 2010 |accessdate=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quiet Birdmen print a periodical called ''BEAM'' which features stories, jokes, and news of hangar get-togethers. No photos of QB parties are allowed in the journal. From time to time, various hangars have published commemorative membership books consisting of a brief recounting of the club's history, and photograph portraits of individual members. One such book was owned by club member K. S. "Slim" Lindsay, printed in May 1936. After Lindsay's death, it was donated in 2007 by his daughter to [[Wright State University]]. The leather-bound book has 160 pages and 640 photographs of Quiet Birdmen including portraits of Jimmy Doolittle, Wiley Post, Roscoe Turner, Walter R. Brookins and Ephraim Watkins "Pop" Cleveland.&lt;ref name=Lindsay&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.libraries.wright.edu/special/collectionguides/files/ms359.pdf |title=MS-359: K.S.

Astronaut [[Edward Givens]] died in a car crash following a QB meeting. On a rainy Monday night, June 5, 1967, the Houston hangar of Quiet Birdmen met at the Skylane Motel on Telephone Road in [[Pearland, Texas]]. Fellow astronaut [[Gordon Cooper]] was there, and so were two U.S. Air Force reservists who had just been invited to their first QB meeting: Major William "Bill" Hall and Lieutenant Colonel Francis "Fran" Dellorto. Hall and Dellorto were told that they would become full members after attending twelve meetings. Givens was not drinking alcoholic beverages at the party as he was required at an important meeting the following morning. Between 11:30 pm and midnight, Givens offered Hall and Dellorto a ride back to their quarters at [[Ellington Airport (Texas)|Ellington Air Force Base]] in Houston, and the three left the motel in Givens' [[Volkswagen Beetle]].&lt;ref name=FallenAstronauts&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iJ8WwRBNgk0C&amp;pg=PA190 |pages=190–193 |title=Fallen astronauts: heroes who died reaching for the moon |last1=Burgess |first1=Colin |last2=Doolan |first2=Kate |last3=Vis |first3=Bert |publisher=U of Nebraska Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-8032-6212-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Givens drove north toward the main east–west highway, but mistakenly turned east onto parallel Knapp Road. He missed a sharp turn in the road and the car crashed into an irrigation ditch. Though he was wearing his lap belt, Givens' chest was crushed against the steering wheel. In the front passenger seat, Dellorto was seriously injured, while in the back seat, Hall was in fair condition. Givens, 37 years old, died on the way to the hospital early on June 6, pronounced dead on arrival at 12:40 am.&lt;ref name=Jean1986&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1986-03-18/news/0210010230_1_gemini-9-bassett-astronauts/2 |title=Memorial Will Honor All Who Died |work=Orlando Sentinel |date=March 18, 1986 |last=Jean |first=Charlie |page=2 |accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautmemorial.net/givens.htm |title=Major Edward Galen Givens, Jr. (USAF) |work=In Memoriam: The Astronaut/Cosmonaut Memorial Web Site |accessdate=July 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531233432/http://www.astronautmemorial.net/givens.htm |archivedate=May 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:KE-XBifY91gJ:www.docstoc.com/docs/14737923/Auto-Accident-Kills-MSC-Pilot-Givens+edward+givens+vw&amp;cd=22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;source=www.google.com |title=Auto Accident Kills MSC Pilot Givens |work=Roundup |publisher=NASA Manned Space Center |location=Houston, Texas |date=June 9, 1967 |volume=6 |number=17 |accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ventura, California]], on a Monday night in October 1974, [[Ben Rich]] gave a talk to the Oxnard and Santa Barbara hangar of Quiet Birdmen about the [[Skunk Works]] program at [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]. Rich spoke of the [[Lockheed U-2]] and [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71 Blackbird]] programs which had recently been declassified, and identified QB member and attendee R. Scott Beat as a former U-2 pilot. Beat wrote in his book ''So Many Ways to Die: Surviving As a Spy in the Sky'' that this was the first time any of his friends or family had heard of that part of his past—he had faithfully kept the government's secrets to himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ewErTmZpDFAC&amp;pg=PA160 |pages=160–161 |title=So Many Ways to Die: Surviving As a Spy in the Sky |last=Beat |first=R.

Beginning in 1971, rancher and aviator [[John Spoor Broome|John S. "Jack" Broome]], a founding member of the Oxnard hangar, held an annual private airshow and barbecue for the Quiet Birdmen at his ranch in [[Camarillo, California]]. Members of the [[Commemorative Air Force]] and [[Planes of Fame]] often piloted several of their [[warbird]]s at the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.air-and-space.com/20060612%20Camarillo.htm |title=Quiet Birdmen Airshow operations at Camarillo, June 12, 2006 |publisher=Air-and-Space.com |accessdate=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Broome died in April 2009, the 39th annual airshow was held in his memory in June 2009.&lt;ref name=VanGilder&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg-photo.com/airshow/qb39/qb39.html |title=QB-39 Staging, Camarillo Airport |last=Van Gilder |first=Eric |publisher=Van Gilder Aviation Photography |date=June 9, 2009 |accessdate=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broome family hosted one final private airshow for the Quiet Birdmen on June 14, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg-photo.com/airshow/qb40/qb40-1.html |title=QB-40 |last=Van Gilder |first=Eric |publisher=Van Gilder Aviation Photography |date=June 14, 2010 |accessdate=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''science project''' is an [[education]]al activity for students involving [[experiment]]s or construction of models in one of the science disciplines. Students may present their science project at a [[science fair]], so they may also call it a science fair project. Science projects may be classified into four main types. Science projects are done by students worldwide.

==Experimental projects==

Experimental projects, also known as investigatory projects, start with a question (AKA a hypothesis), use the [[scientific method]] to complete the research, and end with a report detailing the results and conclusions and an abstract.

==Engineering projects==

Engineering projects, also known as technology projects, start with a design of a machine or mechanical structure with the purpose of improving strength or performance. Researchers implement all their design ideas in a model they construct. The model will be tested to evaluate the design.

==Display projects==
[[File:Guatemalan Boy and His Science Project.jpg|alt=A boy holding a three-dimensional display of the planets in the solar system|thumb|This student is carrying his science project to school.]]

Display projects involve a creative assembly of a [[display board]] and construction of a model to show a visual representation of a larger fact. Making a model of the [[solar system]], a house, or of a simple [[Electrical network|electric circuit]] are considered display projects. Display boards are used to enhance the presentation. A [[tablet computer]] can be attached to the display board to make interactive display boards.

==Theoretical projects==

Theoretical projects may involve the same format as experimental or engineering projects. However, for
several possible reasons, such as lack of feasibility due to costs, the actual experiment is not performed.

The '''Singapore Cricket Club''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''SCC'''; {{zh|s=新加坡板球俱乐部}}) is one of the premier sports and [[social club]]s in [[Singapore]]. Its clubhouse is located on [[Connaught Drive]] on the south end of the [[Padang, Singapore|Padang]] in Singapore's [[central business district]].

The SCC was established in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cricket.com.au/news/cricket-unusual-destinations-canada-steve-smith-usa-malaysia-morocco-singapore/2018-05-21 |title=New ground: Five unusual cricket venues |work=Cricket Australia |accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the club has had three clubhouse buildings on the Padang. The first was erected in the 1860s and the second in 1877. The third, which forms the core of the present-day clubhouse, was built in 1884.  

As the second oldest club in Singapore, the SCC today has over 3,000 members. [[Cricket]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[Association football|football]] and [[field hockey]] are played on the Padang, and the club also has facilities for [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[tennis]], [[bowls|lawn bowls]], [[billiards]] and [[snooker]].

The club has played host to many international cricket events over the years. It also hosts the annual [[Singapore Cricket Club International Rugby Sevens]] tournament and an annual Soccer Sevens competition.

They also have a football team participating in the [[Singapore National Football League|National Football League]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5319">[[File:Alvarado.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[Pedro de Alvarado]] led the initial conquest of Guatemala and [[Central America]].]]

The arrival of the [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] in [[Guatemala]] began in 1524 with the conquest of the [[Guatemalan Highlands]] and neighbouring Pacific plain under the command of [[Pedro de Alvarado]].  After the conquest and the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|colonial]] era, more people came to the country not as conquerors, but to do business or daily activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Minster|first1=Christopher|title=The Maya: Conquest of the K’iche by Pedro de Alvarado|url=http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/theconquestofthemaya/p/08mayaconquest.htm|website=About (Education)|accessdate=2014-10-29|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{main|Spanish conquest of Guatemala}}
{{also|Spanish conquest of Petén|Spanish conquest of Chiapas}}
[[File:Manuelestradaretrato.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]] ]]
Early [[Europe]]an immigrants to Guatemala were Spaniards who conquered the indigenous [[Maya peoples|Maya]] population in 1524. They ruled for almost 300 years. Although the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala]] was primarily the result of its technical superiority, the Spaniards were helped by Nahua allies from central Mexico, and by indigenous Maya who were already involved in bitter struggles between rival kingdoms. Following the Spaniards' arrival, European epidemics and oppression of conquerors reduced the indigenous population from 14 million to 2 million in two generations. Currently, the population of [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous people]] is nearly 5 million.

Despite being greatly outnumbered by the Maya - historians estimate that only a few thousand Spaniards settled in Guatemala before independence - the latter were able to impose their colonial system through a reign of terror. As a result of Guatemala having few naturally-rich resources, like gold and silver, the [[Spain|Spanish]] conquest focused their efforts on forced labor of the indigenous population.

The Spaniards established a system of domination that ensured slaves worked the land and paid taxes in the form of goods. The system is structured to exploit the indigenous population without destroying it. In 1663, King [[Philip IV of Spain]] tried to abolish slavery in the colonies, but the [[Criollo people|criollos]] (those of [[Spain|Spanish]] origin born in Guatemala), fought fervently to ensure that forced labor continued to practice until the early 20th century.

However, when legislation to safeguard these lands was abolished in the 19th century, the criollos (from [[Spain]], [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]]) and [[Ladino people|Ladino]] soon came and established [[plantation]]s producing export crops, turning the rural population into a mass of unemployed migrant farm workers.

In 1821, the Republic of Guatemala - which included the [[Soconusco]] region (now part of southern [[Mexico]]), as well as what are now the countries of [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Costa Rica]] - had just 1.5 million inhabitants, mostly concentrated in the urban centers of the republic. In 1823, after a brief period as part of the [[First Mexican Empire|Mexican Empire]], the republic became known as the [[Federal Republic of Central America|United Provinces of Central America]].

After a period of political instability exacerbated by the collapse of the world market for [[indigo]], main exporter in the region of Europe, each province seceded from the federation, starting with [[Costa Rica]]. The federation collapsed between 1838 and 1840, when Guatemala became an independent nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=James|title=Guatemala: Economic Migrants Replace Political Refugees|url=http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/guatemala-economic-migrants-replace-political-refugees|website=MPI|accessdate=2014-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surinamese Dutch''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Surinaams-Nederlands'', {{IPA-nl|ˌsyːriˈnaːms ˈneːdərˌlɑnts}}) is the form of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] spoken in [[Suriname]] and is the official language in Suriname, a former [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colony. Dutch is spoken as a native language by about 60% of the population, most of them being bilingual with [[Sranan Tongo]], [[Caribbean Hindustani#Sarnami Hindustani|Hindustani]], [[Javanese language#Surinamese-Javanese|Javanese]], and other languages. Nevertheless, Dutch is the sole official language of the country. Surinamese Dutch is easily intelligible with other forms of Dutch. Furthermore, as opposed to other languages that have different forms in the Americas (e.g., [[American English]] vs. [[British English]]) the regulation and thus standardised spelling of the Dutch language is done through a joint Dutch-Belgian-Surinamese organization, the [[Dutch Language Union]], and thus has no regional differences regarding spelling. Suriname has been an associate member of this [[Dutch Language Union|Nederlandse Taalunie]] since 2005. Therefore, many typical Surinamese words were added to the official [[Wordlist of the Dutch language|Wordlist of Standard Dutch]], known as "the Green Booklet" (''Groene Boekje'').

Some words exclusive to Surinamese Dutch are ''okseltruitje,{{dubious|date=September 2015}} bacove, cellulair,{{dubious|date=September 2015}} wied,{{dubious|date=September 2015}} zwamp, roti, kouseband, schaafijs, bobo'' and ''buitenvrouw.'' Surinamese Dutch has been heavily influenced by other languages spoken by residents.

==Phonology==
In Surinamese Dutch, the voiced fricatives {{IPA|/v, z, ɣ/}} have completely merged with the voiceless {{IPA|/f, s, x/}} into voiceless {{IPA|[{{IPA link|f}}, {{IPA link|s}}, {{IPA link|x}}]}}.{{sfnp|De Schutter|2013|pp=448, 451}}

==History of Surinamese Dutch==
Dutch was introduced in what is now Suriname when [[Paramaribo]] and its environs became a Dutch colony. The remainder of Suriname, however, remained in [[British Empire|British]] hands. Only after the Dutch had lost [[New Netherland]] (including present-day [[New York City]]) to the British did they in exchange receive the rest of Suriname. After this, Dutch became the language of communication between [[Indigenous peoples in Suriname|Native Surinamese]], [[Africans]] and the Dutch colonial administration. In 1876, the language in addition became official in the [[Education in Suriname|Surinamese education system]] whilst new immigrants from [[British India]] and [[Java]] also picked up the language. These immigrants also added features to spoken Dutch that are not present in [[Europe]]an variants of Dutch.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4448">'''Teen Tech Week''' is an annual national event held on the second week in March by [[YALSA]] in conjunction with [[American Library Association|ALA]]. Teen Tech Week promotes digital resources within libraries across the country that are available for teens and their families.&lt;ref&gt;http://teentechweek.ning.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the general theme of Teen Tech Week is "Get Connected". If the current years specific theme does not speak to you or your library you can always use the general theme instead. The most important thing about Teen Tech Week is that teens are being encouraged to come out and visit their local library and learn about all of the different technical and digital tools that are available to them.

==Past Themes==

===2014===

This year's theme was DIY@your library. "Libraries bridge the gap between in-school and out-of-school time, helping teens learn through digital media so they can achieve more academically and develop the digital and media literacy skills they will need in order to be informed, productive citizens."&lt;ref&gt;About Teen Tech Week http://teentechweek.ning.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015===

The 2015 theme was "Libraries Are for the Making."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Teen Tech Week | url=http://teentechweek.ning.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why Have Teen Tech Week==

While there are millions of teens who do not have access to a home computer most still have access to a library. Libraries give teens the opportunity to gain important digital literacy skills.  "Libraries offer a bridge across the digital divide. Libraries also recognize that digital media plays an important part in a teens’ life.  That is why more libraries than ever are helping teens build critical digital literacy skills, which they will use to obtain scholarships, secure jobs, effectively manage their online identity and more.&lt;ref&gt;http://teentechweek.ning.com/page/faq&lt;/ref&gt;

==How Can You Participate==

The first thing that you should do is sign up on YALSA's website to let them know that you are participating. The reason for this is because YALSA is a nonprofit organization that depends on the support of its members. When you register on the website you are letting them know that "your library supports encouraging teens to be safe, responsible users of the many technologies available to them. By registering, you are telling YALSA that this program is worthwhile, and we will continue to sponsor the week." &lt;ref&gt;http://teentechweek.ning.com/page/faq&lt;/ref&gt;

Once registered how you participate?

There are numerous ways in which you and your library can participate in Teen Tech Week.  You can incorporate special programs or activities into your library program for that week or you can even simply push your digital media items and encourage the teens and parents who come into the library and check them out and help them learn about what is available to them.

Can non-librarians participate?

YES! "Teen Tech Week is a national initiative aimed at teens, their parents, librarians, educators, booksellers and other concerned adults. If you would like to participate, just register!" &lt;ref&gt;http://teentechweek.ning.com/page/faq&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Utah Compact''' is a declaration of five principles whose stated purpose is to "guide [[Utah]]'s immigration discussion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://the-utah-compact.com/|title=The Utah Compact|last=|first=|date=|work=The Utah Compact text|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a ceremony held on the grounds of the [[Utah State Capitol]] on November 11, 2010, it was signed by business, law enforcement and religious leaders including the Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Utah Compact' urges guidelines for immigration discussion |author=Carole Mikita |newspaper=KSL-TV |date=11 November 2010 |url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=13237741 |accessdate=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by various other community leaders and individuals.

== Principles ==
The Principles of the Utah Compact are

# '''Federal Solutions'''. Immigration, including border policy is a federal issue.
# '''Law Enforcement'''. Law Enforcement should have discretion. Local law enforcement should focus on criminal activity rather than violations of federal civil code.
# '''Families'''. Stating opposition to policies that unnecessarily separate families.
# '''Economy'''. Recognition of the economic role of immigrants. Advocates support for free market policies to maximize individual freedom and opportunity.
# '''A Free Society'''. Recognition that immigrants are part of society. States the need for a "humane approach to this reality, reflecting our unique culture, history and spirit of inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://the-utah-compact.com/|title=The Utah Compact|last=|first=|date=|work=The Utah Compact text|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Among supporters, the compact was complimented in a [[New York Times]] editorial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=NY Times editorial|title=The Utah Compact|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/opinion/05sun1.html?ref=immigration | work=The New York Times|date=4 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as coming from "people of good sense and good will". [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) notably endorsed the Compact via a public statement, though it declined to sign the Compact itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/51695854-90/arizona-attorney-federal-immigration.html.csp "Immigration: Shurtleff can't find support for Compact"] ([[Salt Lake Tribune]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/dec/31/nation/la-na-mormon-immigration-20110101/2 "Among Mormons, a deep divide on immigration"] ([[Los Angeles Times]])&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church counts about half of Utah's residents as its adherents, but the Compact is more controversial in Utah [[Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormon culture]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/51664127-78/bills-church-illegal-immigration.html.csp "LDS panned on immigration"] ([[Salt Lake Tribune]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher = [[New York Times]]|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/03/us/politics/romney-immigration-position-at-odds-with-mormon-church.html?_r=1&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;emc=tha24|title = Romney’s Tough Immigration View Is at Odds With His Church|first = Laurie|last = Goodstein|date = February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

The Utah Compact is alleged by the [[Minuteman Project]], conservative commentator [[Bob Lonsberry]], and former Arizona State Senator Karen Johnson to contain deliberately misleading language intended to subtly promote tolerance of illegal immigration, opposition to enforcement of immigration law, and [[amnesty]] for illegal aliens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Utah Minuteman Project responds to 'Utah Compact'|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=13287978&amp;pid=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Bob Lonsberry]]|title=Utah Compact is Offensive, Arrogant and Dishonest|url=http://lonsberry.com/writings.cfm?story=3003&amp;go=4 |date=15 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswithviews.com/Johnson/karenA.htm series of eight articles by Karen Johnson on the Utah Compact]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27164">{{Violence against women}}
'''Violence against prostitutes''' has been reported worldwide, both on a physical and psychological level. The victims are predominantly women, including in extreme cases murder both inside and outside the workplace.

== Prevalence ==
Women working in prostitution experience more levels of violence against them than women working in other fields.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Rodríguez Martínez, Pilar. "An Intersectional Analysis of Intimate Partner Violence and Workplace Violence among Women Working in Prostitution."''Revista Española De Investigaciones Sociologicas'' no. 151 (July 2015): 123-138. ''SocINDEX with Full Text'', EBSCO''host'' (accessed November 2, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the [[homicide]] rate for female sex workers  in the United States was estimated to be 204 per 100,000, although this figure mixes illegal work with legal work.{{sfn|Potterat|Brewer|Muth|Rothenberg|2004}} This figure is considerably higher than that for the next riskiest occupations in the United States during a similar period (4 per 100,000 for female liquor store workers and 29 per 100,000 for male taxicab drivers).{{sfn|Castillo|Jenkins|1994}}  The prevalence of violence against prostitutes varies by location.  A study of female prostitutes in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada over the age of 14 who used illicit drugs other than marijuana found that 57% of prostitutes experienced some form of gender-based violence over an 18-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Prevalence and structural correlates of gender based violence among a prospective cohort of female sex workers|url = http://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b2939|journal = BMJ|date = 2009-08-11|issn = 0959-8138|pmc = 2725271|pmid = 19671935|pages = b2939|volume = 339|doi = 10.1136/bmj.b2939|first = Kate|last = Shannon|first2 = T.|last2 = Kerr|first3 = S. A.|last3 = Strathdee|first4 = J.|last4 = Shoveller|first5 = J. S.|last5 = Montaner|first6 = M. W.|last6 = Tyndall}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a study of 1,000 female (both cisgender and transgender) sex-workers in [[Phnom Penh|Phnom Penh, Cambodia]] found 93% of women surveyed had been the victim of rape in the past year.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/BSP/GENDER/PDF/HIVGBVbackgroundreport.pdf|title = Addressing the links between gender-based violence and HIV in the Great Lakes region|date = |accessdate = October 29, 2015|website = UNESCO|publisher = United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of violence ==

=== Physical ===
[[Violence|Physical violence]] is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as "the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|title = WHO {{!}} World report on violence and health|url = http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/|website = www.who.int|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Physical violence is more commonly experienced by outdoor sex-workers with 47% of prostitutes working outdoors reporting being kicked, punched, or slapped in one study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In a study of prostitutes working in San Francisco, 82% of participants reported having experienced some type of physical violence since entering prostitution, with 55% of these assaults being committed by a client.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Prostitution, Violence, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1300/J013v27n03_03|journal = Women &amp; Health|pages = 37–49|volume = 27|issue = 3|doi = 10.1300/j013v27n03_03|first = Melissa|last = Farley|first2 = Howard|last2 = Barkan|pmid=9698636|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different study found a slightly rate lower with 74% of sex-workers reported experiencing some form of physical abuse in their lifetime.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = History of Abuse and Psychological Distress Symptoms among Female Sex Workers in Two Mexico-U.S. Border Cities|journal = Violence and victims|date = 2009-01-01|issn = 0886-6708|pmc = 2777761|pmid = 19634364|pages = 399–413|volume = 24|issue = 3|first = Monica|last = Ulibarri|first2 = Shirley J.|last2 = Semple|first3 = Swati|last3 = Rao|first4 = Steffanie A.|last4 = Strathdee|first5 = Miguel A.|last5 = Fraga-Vallejo|first6 = Jesus|last6 = Bucardo|first7 = Adela|last7 = De la Torre|first8 = Juan|last8 = Salazar-Reyna|first9 = Prisci|last9 = Orozovich|doi=10.1891/0886-6708.24.3.399}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless, the general consensus among most studies regarding violence against prostitutes is that rates of physical violence against prostitutes is extremely high, particularly among female sex workers (transgender inclusive) who experience higher rates of physical violence than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Psychological ===
[[Psychological abuse]], also referred to as mental abuse or emotional abuse is  characterized by a person subjecting or exposing another to behavior that may result in psychological trauma, including [[anxiety]], [[chronic depression]], or [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dutton | first1 = D. G. | year = 1994 | title = Patriarchy and wife assault: The ecological fallacy | url = | journal = Violence and Victims | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 125–140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Psychological Abuse in Violent Domestic Relations|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pv6XIjT4MpUC|publisher = Springer Publishing Company|date = 2004-01-01|isbn = 9780826111463|first = K. Daniel O'Leary|last = PhD|first2 = Roland D. Maiuro|last2 = PhD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Childhood emotional abuse|journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry|date = 1996-02-01|issn = 0007-1250|pmid = 8837902|pages = 143–148|volume = 168|issue = 2|first = A. E.|last = Thompson|first2 = C. A.|last2 = Kaplan|doi=10.1192/bjp.168.2.143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United Nations Population Fund]] says that this type of violence "includes, but is not limited to, being insulted (e.g. called derogatory names) or made to feel bad about oneself; being humiliated or belittled in front of other people; being threatened with loss of custody of one's children; being confined or [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolated]] from family or friends; being threatened with harm to oneself or someone one cares about; repeated shouting, inducing fear through [[intimidating]] words or gestures; [[controlling behavior]]; and the destruction of possessions."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There are certain types of psychological or emotional abuse that sex workers are more prone to such as denial of basic needs, forced drug or alcohol consumption, and being arrested for carrying condoms to name a few.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Women working in prostitution are especially vulnerable to psychological abuse, particularly [[verbal abuse]], because many customers and other members of society view them as "whores" or as generally undesirable women. Often verbal abuse will occur either while the service is being given, or after it has been given and the customer is not satisfied. In both these cases, verbal abuse can be a precursor to sexual violence from the client.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In one study, 78% of sex-workers reported having experienced emotional or psychological abuse in their lifetime.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Sexual ===
[[Sexual violence]] is any sexual act or attempt to obtain a sexual act by violence or coercion, unwanted sexual comments or advances, acts to traffic a person or acts directed against a person's sexuality, regardless of the relationship to the victim.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization., World report on violence and health (Geneva: World Health Organization, 2002), Chapter 6, pp. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elements of Crimes, Article 7(1)(g)-6 Crimes against humanity of sexual violence, elements 1. Accessed through [http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/legal%20texts%20and%20tools/official%20journal/Pages/elements%20of%20crimes.aspx] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506063708/http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/legal%20texts%20and%20tools/official%20journal/Pages/elements%20of%20crimes.aspx |date=2015-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDougall, Gay J. (1998). ''Contemporary forms of slavery: systematic rape, sexual slavery and slavery-like practices during armed conflict''.  Final report submitted by Ms. Jay J. McDougall, Special Rapporteur,&lt;/ref&gt;  The risks of sexual abuse are overall lower than the risks of physical abuse. with the exception of indoor prostitutes who report a higher rate of rape or attempted rape than any one type of physical violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In one study, 44% of sex-workers reported having experienced sexual abuse in their lifetime.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Rates of sexual assault and rape are higher among women (including transgender women) than among men, though the overall rate is high with one study finding that 68% of respondents had been raped since entering prostitution.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  These high levels of sexual violence suffered by sex workers have very traumatic effects on the men and women working as prostitutes. High levels of rape other forms of sexual violence while working as a prostitute have been linked to higher levels of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Contributing factors ==
Studies have shown that younger sex-workers tend to experience more client violence than their older colleagues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Furthermore, cisgender and transgender female sex workers are also more likely to experience violence committed by a client than their male sex worker counterparts.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Legal vs illegal sex work ===
Laws prohibiting prostitution can make it difficult for the men and women engaging in prostitution to report any violence they may experience while on the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&amp;context=hwlj|title = For Their Own Good: The Results of the Prostitution Laws as Enforced by Cops, Politician and Judges|last = Almodovar|first = Norma Jean|date = January 1, 1999|journal = Hastings Women's Law Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often transactions or arrangements to meet up with clients must be made in secret in places where prostitution is illegal.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Barnard, Marina A. "Violence and vulnerability: conditions of work for streetworking prostitutes." ''Sociology Of Health &amp; Illness'' 15, no. 5 (November 1993): 683-705. ''SocINDEX with Full Text'', EBSCO''host'' (accessed November 2, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The decriminalization of sex work in New Zealand has shown that violence is reduced when sex workers are not forced to work alone, or in isolated places. Sex work was always legal in New Zealand but decriminalization removed laws that increased danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/parl-support/research-papers/00PLSocRP12051/prostitution-law-reform-in-new-zealand|title=New Zealand Parliament - Prostitution Law Reform in New Zealand|work=Parliament.nz|accessdate=2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perpetrators ==

===Violent clients, pimps and police officers===
Perpetrators may include violent clients and [[pimps]]. Clients oftentimes attempt to maintain a power balance that favors them over the prostitutes.  This is often done through different methods of violence such as sexual, emotional, and physical.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Though pimps may be perpetrators of violence against sex workers with 53% of sex workers in one study reporting that violence at the hands of pimps is a major problem, 33% of subjects interviewed in that same study reported that the main benefit to having a pimp is the protection from potential assault.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=ca066bbe-c370-4f90-a033-f2ed967c0e92%2540sessionmgr112&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=120|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the illegality of sex work in many parts of the world, sex workers often have to service clients in discreet and isolated spaces where they are less likely to get caught by the police. Because of this isolation, sex workers are made more vulnerable to attacks by their clients. According to a study conducted on one hundred and thirty people working in [[San Francisco]] as street sex workers, 82% had been physically assaulted, 83% had been threatened with a weapon and 68% had been raped while working as prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/prostitution_research/000021.html |title=Prostitution Research &amp; Education Website |publisher=Prostitutionresearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918115439/http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/prostitution_research/000021.html |archive-date=2012-09-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries such as the United States sex work is illegal, and so sex workers are not able to report violence done against them in fear of being arrested themselves. In certain states anti-prostitution mandates carry a minimum sentence and can increase to felony charge after multiple arrests, which leads to difficulty finding housing and employment, and disqualification for welfare benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Melissa Gira. "The War on Sex Workers." ''Reason.com''. N.p., 21 Jan. 2013. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally sex workers may be registered as sex offenders, or face deportation if they have precarious migratory or citizenship status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wahab | first1 = Stéphanie | last2 = Panichelli | first2 = Meg | year = 2013 | title = Ethical and Human Rights Issues in Coercive Interventions With Sex Workers | url = | journal = Journal of Women and Social Work | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 344–49 | doi=10.1177/0886109913505043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the stigma that exists around sex work, police are less likely to investigate attacks on sex workers.{{sfn|Wong|Holroyd|Bingham|2011}}  As one sex worker in South Africa reports "to gather evidence of a crime against a sex worker, they have to first take it seriously,”. “If we go to the police to report abuse, we’re made fun of, we’re told ‘you deserve it.’ They chase you away,” notes another sex worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rewire.news/article/2011/12/15/ending-police-abuse-sex-workers/|title=Police Abuse of Sex Workers: A Global Reality, Widely Ignored|last=Mgbako|first=Chi|date=December 15, 2011|website=Rewire|publisher=|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police officers themselves are common perpetrators of violence against prostitutes. A study of sex-workers in Phnom Penh, Cambodia found that half of the women had been beaten by police and about a third had been gang-raped by police.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; "In South Africa, where sex work has been illegal since the former apartheid regime criminalized it in 1957, police officers often fine sex workers inordinate sums of money and pocket the cash, resulting in a pattern of economic extortion of sex workers by state agents."&lt;ref&gt;Mgbako, Chi.

[[File:Jack the ripper.jpg|thumb|Jack the Ripper attacks a woman]]
Sex workers (particularly those engaging in [[street prostitution]]) are also sometimes targeted by [[serial killer]]s, who may consider them easy targets and less likely to be missed, or who use the religious and social stigma associated with sex workers as justification for their murder.

The unidentified serial killer known as [[Jack the Ripper]] killed at least five sex workers in [[London]] in 1888. Due to the frequent murders of prostitutes at that time and place, however, it is difficult to be certain of the number killed by Jack the Ripper. These particular murders are distinguished from other murders of sex workers during the same time period due to the post-mortem mutilations that occurred, and it is for that reason that other murders of prostitutes are not usually attributed to the Ripper, or are disputed.

[[Peter Sutcliffe]] (aka the Yorkshire Ripper) murdered 13 women, some of whom were sex workers, from 1975-1980 in [[Northern England]].

[[Gary Ridgway]] (aka the Green River Killer), confessed to killing 48 sex workers from 1982 to 1998, making him one of the most prolific serial killers in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/11/05/green.river.killings/index.html |title=Green River Killer avoids death in plea deal - November 6, 2003 |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Hansen]] murdered between 15 and 21 sex workers, near [[Anchorage, Alaska]], between 1980 and 1983.

[[Joel Rifkin]] confessed to killing 17 sex workers in the New York area between 1989 and 1993, without there having been a missing persons report filed on any of the women during that time.

[[Robert Pickton]], a Canadian who lived near [[Vancouver]], made headlines after the remains of numerous missing sex workers were found on his family farm. He has now been convicted of the murders of 6 women who went missing from Vancouver's [[Downtown Eastside]], and is suspected by police of killing at least twenty more (though no charges have been filed in relation to their deaths).  In December 2007 he was sentenced to life in prison, with no possibility of parole for 25 years.

In December 2006, [[Steve Wright (serial killer)|Steve Wright]] murdered five sex workers in [[Ipswich]], [[England]] (see [[Ipswich serial murders]]).

== Efforts to combat ==
Most efforts to advocate for prostitutes have focused on prevention of the spread of AIDS/HIV+ among the general population rather than focusing on how certain policies would benefit the prostitutes themselves.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  This focus has neglected many of the issues of violence facing sex workers.  Recently, however, there has been an effort to eradicate violence against prostitutes from a wider perspective.  The United Nations Population Fund, in conjunction with several other organizations, recommends community empowerment, led by sex workers, as a way to combat violence against sex-workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Implementing comprehensive HIV/STI programmes with sex workers: Practical approaches from collaborative interventions|url = http://www.unfpa.org/publications/implementing-comprehensive-hivsti-programmes-sex-workers-practical-approaches|website = UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;   UNPF also advocates for changing perceptions to view sex work as work, rather than an illegal activity.  One issue facing efforts to prevent violence against prostitutes is that there is a low level of reporting violence among prostitutes.  A study of female sex-workers in India found that 54% of female sex-workers do not report violence committed against them, and only 36% shared their experience with NGOs or a peer or family member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Non-Disclosure of Violence among Female Sex Workers: Evidence from a Large Scale Cross-Sectional Survey in India|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0098321|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2014-05-20|pmc = 4028275|pmid = 24846145|pages = e98321|volume = 9|issue = 5|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0098321|first = Bidhubhusan|last = Mahapatra|first2 = Madhusudana|last2 = Battala|first3 = Akash|last3 = Porwal|first4 = Niranjan|last4 = Saggurti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By sex workers ===
Because of the increased risk of violence associated with working in sex work, many sex workers have begun adopting their own personal policies to reduce the likelihood of becoming the victims of violence.  A study by Maureen A. Norton-Hawk found that "40% percent of sex workers have a policy of refusing to provide services in an alley, 54% refuse to provide services in a drug house, and 68% refuse to provide services in an abandoned building."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  Often sex workers must rely on themselves or each other for support in ending violence as many campaigns to end violence against women ignore the needs of sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobs | first1 = Michelle S | year = 1999 | title = Prostitutes, Drug Users, and Thieves: The Invisible Women in the Campaign to End Violence Against Women | url = | journal = Temple Political &amp; Civil Rights Law Review | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 459–475 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government policy ===
[[File:Sex Worker Rights - London SlutWalk 2011.jpg|thumb|Sex Workers' Rights demonstration at London SlutWalk 2011]]
[[UN Women]] supports the decriminalization of sex work in order to protect sex-workers from violence and abuse and encourages the criminalization of forms of violence, coercion and exploitation in sex work.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;UN Women. "Notes on Sex Work, Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking." NSWP (2013).  Accessed September 23, 2015. http://www.nswp.org/resource/un-womens-note-sex-work-sexual-exploitation-and-trafficking&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, however, the United States of America requires that all countries it gives aid to for AIDS/HIV+ prevention and relief agree to an "[[anti-prostitution pledge]]" that dictates that the country receiving aid must adopt policy that treats sex work and prostitution the same as sex trafficking.  This policy has resulted in inadequate attention being paid to the health needs of prostitutes and limits the ability of the government to address the specific needs that sex workers have.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Lerum, Kari."Reducing Violence against Sex Workers: What are the policy options?." Human Rights for All (2011). Accessed September 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, in the United States, many states have mandatory minimum sentencing laws that require judges to give anyone convicted of prostitution a mandatory minimum prison sentence.  This can, in turn, make it less likely that prostitutes take legal action against the perpetrators of violence against them because doing so could be risking jail time.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  One possible policy option that the Netherlands has done would be to designate specific places for sex workers and clients to meet up and arrange and engage in sexual activities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  This would provide a safe and secure place for sexual services to be sold without having to remain in private which can be a risk factor for violence against prostitutes.  Some organizations have even suggested forming support groups composed of sex workers in the area as a way to give sex workers the support they often lack.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="79877">The term '''Vlachs''' ({{lang-hr|Vlasi}}) was initially used in medieval Croatian and Venetian history for a [[Romance-speaking]] pastoralist community, called "[[Vlachs]]" and "[[Morlachs]]", inhabiting the mountains and lands of the [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|Croatian Kingdom]] and the [[Republic of Venice]] ([[Venetian Dalmatia]]) from the early 14th century. By the end of the 15th century they were highly assimilated with the Slavs and lost their language or were at least bilingual, while some communities managed to preserve and continue to speak their language ([[Istro-Romanians]]).

Later in the 16th and 17th century with the Ottoman conquest and mass migrations, the term was primarily used for a socio-cultural and professional segment of the population rather than to an ethnicity, and referred to the mostly [[Serbo-Croatian|Slavic]]-speaking emigrants and refugees from Ottoman-held territories to the Habsburg Empire (such as Croatia) and Republic of Venice ([[Venetian Dalmatia|Dalmatia]]), mostly of Eastern Orthodox faith, lesser Catholic. With the nation-building in the 19th century this population played a significant part in the national ideologies in Croatia and Serbia,{{sfn|Botica|2005|p=35}} and according to religious confession espoused either [[Serbs|Serb]] (a majority) or [[Croats|Croat]] ethnicity.

In Croatia today, "Vlachs" is a recognized national minority (along with 22 other ethnic groups), with 29 individuals declared as Vlachs in the [[2011 Croatian census]], making them the smallest recognized minority in Croatia. Other [[Eastern Romance|Eastern Romance-speaking]] ethnic groups, that were also traditionally referred to as Vlachs in Croatia, now identify by their respective ethnic names – namely [[Romanians]], [[Aromanians]] and [[Istro-Romanians]] (which are native to modern Croatia's [[Istria County]]).

==Appellation==
The meaning of the term "Vlach" within the territory of present-day Croatia (like Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia) differed over time and had multiple meanings. In the [[Middle Ages]] it was primarily an [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] that referred to Romance-speaking pastoralist communities in the mountains, or rarely other [[Romance languages|Romance-speaking]] people like Italians. Due to their specific lifestyle,{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=129}} the term acquired a social-professional (shepherds) connotation. In the 13th and 14th centuries the shepherds of the Balkans were called Vlachs (''Vlasi''), including Slavic-speakers.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=317}} Initially it was used for shepherds and transporters in the hinterland regardless of ethnicity and religion (though often Romance-speaking), strangers and newcomers as opposed to natives (in Istria, for speakers with [[Shtokavian]] traits), for hinterlanders by Dalmatian island inhabitants, for rugged villagers by the townspeople, and later an Orthodox Christian (with time mostly identified with Serbs).{{sfn|Botica|2005|p=41}} From the 16th century, with the Ottoman conquest and mass migrations of Slavic-speaking people, the term "Vlach" was primarily used for a socio-cultural and professional segment of the population, rather than to an ethnicity.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|pp=343-345}}

The Vlachs were distinguished by their semi-nomadic pastoral way of life as economically [[transhumance|transhumant]] [[shepherds]],{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=344}} mainly of sheep, goats and horses.{{sfn|Botica|2005|p=42}} Such a lifestyle allowed specific socio-cultural traits, like learning about the area, orientation during multi-day movement, organization and wartime skills, which was recognized and used already by the Late Medieval nobility and kings.{{sfn|Botica|2005|p=42}} They lived in extended families (as per the Western Balkan type), and were organised into local communities (''knežine''), and were bearers of a strongly patriarchal culture associated with the [[Dinaric Alps]].{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=344}} Among characteristic cultural traits were wearing dark cloths, use of the ''[[gusle]]'' musical instrument (that accompanied epic singing),{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=344}} [[Ojkanje singing]],{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=371}} Neo-Shtokavian "Herzegovinian" idioms and newcomer status.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=344}}

While the Slavic communities managed to form national identities founding regional provinces and kingdoms, Romance-speaking Vlachs didn't manage to form a national identity and were prone to assimilation.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=333}} However, even if they were prone to national, linguistical and cultural assimilation with the Slavs, they did contribute to their respective communities. The problems the Vlachs faced with the creation of the national identity did not differ very much from what other rural communities face. Rural people comprised the majority of the population in the Middle Ages, and the centuries of war, conquest, regional boundaries, migrations, religious conversions, cultural blending and socio-economic problems affected the belonging of a population to a specific South Slavic national group.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=338}} The regions of [[Lika]] (which mostly involved the [[Croatian Military Frontier]]) and [[Dalmatia]] were the border area between [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] empires, a place of mass migrations and mixing of communities.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=332}}

In the area, the confessional, socio-cultural and geo-regional characteristics had a crucial impact on the creation of an ethnic identity.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=340}} The equalization between religious confession and ethnicity began in the middle of the 16th century when the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] (Patriarchate of Peć), which had a significant religious and political influence on Serbs, started since 1557 to identify Orthodoxy with [[Serbdom]].{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=340-343}} Gradually in the 17th century, as Croatian culture was preserved by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Senj-Modruš]] in Croatia, and the [[Franciscan Province of Bosna Srebrena]] in Ottoman Bosnia, the Roman Catholicism was identified with the Croatian national name.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=340-343}} The socio-cultural difference was a lifestyle distinction between the natives (Catholic, peasant, smaller families) and the newer migrants (Orthodox, pastoralist, larger families) from Ottoman and Venetian territory who were referred to as Vlachs in the social sense, and their "Vlach" identity was mainly in the context of claiming the traditional legal rights and privileges of their social class by the state.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|pp=343-345}}

===Medieval usage===
The Vlachs mentioned in medieval documents up until the 16th century, before the Ottoman invasion and migrations, were the progeny of Romanized [[Illyrians]] and [[Thraco-Roman]]s, other pre-Slavic [[Romance language|Romance]]-speaking people, and after arrival in the 6th-8th centuries also of Slavic people.{{sfn|Mužić (Radoslav Lopašić)|2010|p=19}}{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=129}}{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=25}} Some Romance-speaking groups were autochthonous in Croatia and assimilated with Slavs, some were assimilated but preserved their identity and name, while some other groups migrated from Herzegovina to Dalmatia in very late 14th century.{{sfn|Mužić (Bogumil Hrabak)|2010|p=199-202}}

With the arrival of Slavs, Vlachs began to assimilate with them, and being exposed to the Slavic language they gradually began to adopt it as their own.{{sfn|Mužić (Radoslav Lopašić)|2010|p=19}}{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=25}} [[Raymond D'Aguilers]] and [[William of Tyre]] during the passage of the [[Crusaders]] in the 11th century pointed at the difference between the people who live in hilly hinterland, speak Slavic and deal with grooming of the cattle, from those in the coast who still speak Latin language (probably extinct [[Dalmatian language]]) and have different customs.{{sfn|Botica|2005|p=42}} In documents from Lika (1433), Cetina (1436), and Zrmanja (1486–87), a century after their first mention in Croatian historical documents, the Vlachs had mostly non-Christian, traditional South [[Slavic names]] and surnames.{{sfn|Mužić (Bogumil Hrabak)|2010|p=198, 203}} On that note, the Vlachs mostly differed from the Croats who usually had Christian names.{{sfn|Szabo|2002|p=80}} The Vlachs were called as "Vlasi na Hrvateh",{{sfn|Šimunović|2010|p=235}} "good Vlachs" (dobri Vlasi), "good men from katuns" (dobri muži katunari), or "royal Vlachs" (Olahi domini nostri regis, Wolachi banatus regni Croatie).{{sfn|Klaić|1973|p=16-18(I)}}

However, despite this cross-pollination of language some groups of Vlachs may have remained distinct from the Slavs; historical sources from the 14th-15th century differ Slavs and Vlachs in the area of Kotor, Dubrovnik, Bosnia and Croatia (''Slavi et Vlachy'', ''Vlachy et Bosgniani'', ''Serbi et Vlachi'').{{sfn|Szabo|2002|p=80}} In 1345, in Cetina ''Croati et Olachy'' are differed, while in a 1436 document, Catholic Vlachs of the county of Cetina (around the town of [[Sinj]]) were represented as distinct from both the Croats and the Serbs inhabiting the county.{{sfn|Klaić|1973|p=16-18(II)||ps=: ''I da ne drže Hrvati Vlahov mimo jednoga bravara (pastira); I Srblin da nemore otdati (tužiti) na Vlaha, niti Vlah na Srblina''}} In 1450, in the area of Šibenik were differed ''Morlachi ac Hervati''.{{sfn|Szabo|2002|p=80}} In a book by Ragusan historian [[Ludovicus Tubero|Ludovik Crijević]] (1459-1527), ''Writings on the Present Age'', Vlachs (''Valachos'') were distinguished from other people, and were mentioned as "nomadic Illyrians who in the common language are called Vlachs" and there is also the mention of the present-day surname Kožul/lj in "Cossuli, a kind of Illyrian people considered Romans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Ivan Ostojić| title=The Terms Croats Have Used for Their Language| url=http://www.hic.hr/hrvatski/izdavalastvo/FOLIA.pdf| publisher=Folia Croatica-Canadiana| volume=II| location=Ontario| year=1999| pages=33| quote=''Nomades Illyricis quos Valachos vulgo dicunt'', ''simulque Cossuli, ex eo genere Illyrici hominis qui es Romanos putant''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Orthodox migration to [[Žumberak]] in 1538, general commander [[Nikola Jurišić]] mentioned the Vlachs who "in our parts are called as Old Romans" separate from the Serbs and Rascians.{{sfn|Roksandić|1991|p=20}}

During the 14th century, Vlach settlements existed throughout much of today's Croatia,{{sfn|Mužić (Vjekoslav Klaić)|2010|p=14}} but centres of population were focused around the [[Velebit]] and [[Dinara]] mountains and along the [[Krka (Croatia)|Krka]] and [[Cetina]] rivers.{{sfn|Mužić (Vjekoslav Klaić)|2010|p=14}} The Vlachs were divided into ''common'' Vlachs from Cetina and ''royal'' Vlachs from Lika.{{sfn|Šimunović|2010|p=240}} The Vlach population lived on the territory of noble families; of [[Nelipić noble family|Nelipić]] (Cetina–Knin), [[Šubić noble family|Šubić]] ([[Krka (Croatia)|Pokrčje]]), [[Gusić noble family|Gusić]] ([[Zrmanja|Pozrmanje]]), and [[House of Frankopan|Frankopan]] (Lika).{{sfn|Šimunović|2010|p=240(I)|ps=: In Lika are identified by the toponyms ''Krmpote'', ''Šugarje'', ''Barlete'', ''Rmanj'', ''Čečerišće'', ''Ćićerišće'', and ''Čiče'' or ''Ćiće''}} Between 1400 and 1600 many Vlach families had settled Istria and island of Krk.&lt;ref name="Franceschi"&gt;{{cite book| author=Carlo de Franceschi| title=L'Istria: note storiche| url=https://archive.org/details/listrianotestor00frangoog| publisher=G.

The Vlach people distinctively lived a nomadic life as shepherds and as traveling merchants on trading routes.{{sfn|Mužić (Vjekoslav Klaić)|2010|p=11-15}} They lived in villages, and [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s called ''katun'' (ro. ''[[:ro:Cătun|cătun]]''), smaller village-like places in the mountains and lower areas where they dwelled during the transhumant period. The 1436 document (Vlach law) confirmed in [[Klis]] by [[Ban (title)|ban]] [[Ivan Frankopan]] beside clear ethnic diversity in the Cetina county showed that there were two social groups of Vlachs, those with villages who pay tax, and those without villages who are nomads and thus obligated to serve in the army as horsemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cebotarev |first=Andrej |date=June 1996 |title=Review of Stećaks (Standing Tombstones) and Migrations of the Vlasi (Autochthonous Population) in Dalmatia and Southwestern Bosnia in the 14th and 15th Centuries |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=157967 |language=Croatian |journal=Povijesni prilozi [Historical Contributions] |volume=14 |issue=14 |location=Zagreb |publisher=Croatian Institute of History |quote=Taj »zakon« jasno razlikuje dvije socijalne grupe cetinskih Vlaha, pri čemu se navodi: »...

According to Stjepan Pavičić (1931), the Romance Vlachs or Morlachs of the Dinara and Velebit lost their Romance language by the 14th or 15th century, or were at least bilingual at that time.{{sfn|Pavičić|2010|p=73}} The so-called [[Istro-Romanians]], called by themselves ''Rumeri'' or ''Vlasi'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://rrgp.uoradea.ro/art/2013-1/03-RRGP-260-Micle.pdf| title=Istro-Romanians: A Fading Flame| author=Ionel Cǎlin Micle| location=Oradea| publisher=Revista Română de Geografie Politică; University of Oradea| pages=27–34| volume=Year XV, No. 1 May| year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2009/rodos/CUHT/CUHT04.pdf| title=Istro-Romanians: a Study of Culture Identity and Environmental Dynamic| author=Georgeta Marghescu| location=Bucharest| publisher=Department of Social-Human Sciences University "Politehnica" of Bucharest| pages=35–38| year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; continued to speak their language on the island of [[Krk]] (extinct in the 20th century; recorded [[Lord's Prayer|Pater Noster]]) and villages around the Čepić lake in [[Istria]],{{sfn|Pavičić|2010|p=73}} while other communities in the mountains (Ćićarija) above the lake preserved the Shtokavian-Chakavian dialect with Ikavian accent from the southern Velebit and area of Zadar.{{sfn|Pavičić|2010|p=89}}{{sfn|Ribarić|2002|p=48-70}} The documents about Vlachs from Cetina county indicate Chakavian dialect with Ikavian accent.{{sfn|Botica|2005|p=40}}

===Early modern usage===
Socioculturally, there were two main ethnic divisions in the Croatian Military Frontier, those of the "native" ''Croats'' and "immigrant" ''Vlachs''. The Croats were Catholics, Habsburg subjects, made up of an agrarian population concentrated around frontier towns, of [[nuclear families]], and linguistically predominantly [[Chakavian]]-speaking (or Chakavian-based speech). The Vlachs were holders of [[patriarchal]]-[[pastoral]] culture of the [[Dinaric Alps|Dinaric]], refugees from Ottoman and Venetian territories, of [[extended families]], and linguistically [[Shtokavian dialect#Neo-Shtokavian|Neo-Shtokavian]]-speaking.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|pp=343-344}}

The Vlachs were predominantly Orthodox Christian by religion, and also, the traditional social grouping of Vlachs was the Orthodox group itself. The Orthodox Vlachs spoke the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]] while the Catholic Vlachs (the [[Bunjevci]]), spoke the Western Herzegovinian dialect.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|pp=345–346}} The Vlachs were also called on some occasions as ''Rasciani sive Serviani'' and ''Valachicae seu Rascianae gentis'', which was an exonym for the Serbs or Orthodox Christians.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|pp=343-345}}{{sfn|Šišić|1908|pp=162-164}} In the 1500–1800 period in Europe, the religious difference was one of the main cultural differences in ethnic groups. The state triangle at [[Lika]] in what is today Croatia was an area in which Roman Catholicism, Serbian Orthodoxy, and Islam met.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=340}} Ethno-confessionally, the Orthodox Vlachs were part of the Serb identity since the mid 16th-century.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=341}}

Croatian historian Marko Šarić notes that the Lika-Krbava Vlachs can be seen as one of the sub-ethnies of the pre-modern Serb ethnic group.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|pp=357–358}} The Serb–Rascian attributes points on the attachment of Vlach Orthodox communities to the wider pre-modern Serb ethnocultural corps.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=357}} However, although in some documents from the 16th and 17th centuries the Habsburg Imperial Court used the terms ''Vlachs, Rascians and Serbs'' as synonyms (indicating their Orthodox confession), the socio-cultural and ethnological evidence on the ground doesn't support such a simplified interpretation of the ethnic identity of Orthodox Vlachs.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=357}}{{sfn|Roksandić|1991|p=21}}{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=356}} 

J. W. Valvasor in his 1689 work which described the Carniolan–Croatian area of the [[Croatian Military Frontier]] and the [[Maritime Frontier]], differed between Croats and Vlachs (whom he also called [[Uskoks]] and Morlachs), and called the latter's Shtokavian language "Vlach" (''Walachische'') which he said was close to the "Dalmatian" (''Dalmatische'') and "Slavonian" (''Schlavonische'') languages.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=345}} In Venetian usage for Dalmatia, the Slavic language was called Illyrian (''Illirico'') or Serbian (''Serviano'').{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=356}} At the time of the [[Morean War]] (1684–89) Vlachs fled Ottoman-held Lika and temporarily settled as 1,700 families in [[Venetian Dalmatia]], and 530 families in the Karlovac Generalate ([[Croatian Military Frontier]]).{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=358}} Since 1690, they, and some Vlach families from Dalmatia and Bosnia, began to return to their original provinces in Lika and Krbava.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=358}} With them in 1694 arrived Serbian Orthodox metropolitan {{ill|Atanasije Ljubojević|sr}} who established the Lika–Krbava (''Ličko-Krbavska'') and Zrinopolje (''Zrinopoljska'') eparchies.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=358}}

===Anthroponymy===
The data on Lika and Krbava in 1712–14 censuses was studied by Croatian historian Marko Šarić who also divided pre-modern ethnic groups (''etnije'') into Orthodox Vlachs (Serbian Orthodox), Catholic Vlachs (Bunjevci), Carniolans (Kranjci), Croats and Turks (Catholicizated former Muslims), based on Zagreb bishop Martin Brajković's earlier groupings.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=374}}{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=346-359|ps=: The studies found the correlation between the surnames and the interpretation of the population given by the bishop of Senj, Martin Brajković, in 1702. He conveyed the folk tradition of the existence of five ethnic identities which constitute the population of Lika and Krbava. He didn't saw them as an ethnic conglomerate, but a heterogeneous unity. They were Croatians, Vlachian Bunjevci, Turks, Carniolians, and Vlachs. Croatians were partially autochthonous who spoke Chakavian dialect, and the assimilated Vlachian and Carniolian migrants. Vlachian Bunjevci were Catholic, but by tradition differed from other Catholics. Turks were the Muslim population who didn't retreat to Bosnia and were converted to Catholicism. Carniolians were Kajkavian speaking people from the border between Croatia and Carniolia, considered themselves Croats, and were skillful in agriculture and crafts. The fifth, and most predominant, were the only Orthodox identity and group, the Vlachs.}} The statistical categories were minimal to socio-religious and military and economic aspects of the population,{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=359-361}} but including a list of 713 surnames it is an important source for [[onomastics]], and to comprehend the ethnic identity of the population.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=365-367}} 

The majority of nobility in Lika consisted of Catholic Croats, while the vast majority of population were Vlachs (Serbian Orthodox).{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=374, 377-378}} The Serbian Orthodox numbered 71% of the total population in Lika and Krbava, while Catholics overall 29%;{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=362}} the Bunjevci were the second at 16% and Croats were only 4%.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=374}} The future studies have found that at the beginning of the 20th century only 60–64% of the surnames were preserved, with mostly Carniolian surnames vanished.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=367}} The "Turk" surnames indicate an Islamic-"Oriental" influence, and most are Muslim-patronymic.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=367-368}} The "Carniolian" surnames indicate a [[Kajkavian dialect|Kajkavian]] cultural and regional sphere, and are characteristically mostly occupational, many linguistically Germanic, some permeate with other dialects, and they have the smallest share of the ending suffix "-ić".{{sfn|Šarić|2009|pp=354-356, 368-369}} The "Croat" show an arhaic age, many are mentioned in the Middle Age and the 15th and 16th centuries, before the [[Council of Trent]], while some are from the second half of 16th and 17th centuries of Dinaric origin.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=369}}

The anthroponymic structure in surnames of Orthodox Vlachs and Catholic Bunjevci was very similar, while the pastoral (Dinaric) culture, Neo-Shtokavian speech, and social and military role in the frontiers created uniform anthroponymic forms.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=369}} The religious confession wasn't crucial to the pattern of surnames as [[patronymic]] surnames of Catholic or Orthodox character were also found in the opposite confessional group of the mentioned.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=369}} A very large number of surnames were derived from Slavic word roots "-vuk", "-rad", "-mil", and it was also noted that [[matronymic]] surnames and nicknames were more present in the Vlach group than in the others.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=371}} Some 20% were of "Old Balkanic" origin, of Romance root words (and Slavic suffixes "-ić", "-ac", "-an", "-en", "-elj") or Romance suffixes ("-ul", "-as", "-at", "-ta", "-er", "-et", "-man"), and also some found derived from [[Paleo-Balkan languages|Illyrian–Thracian]] root words or with [[Albanian language|Albanian]] suffixes ("-aj" and "-eza").{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=370}}

===Religion===
[[Pope Gregory IX]] in letter from 14 November 1234 for king [[Béla IV of Hungary]] noted that the "Vlachs, although by name are considered Christians... have rituals which are hostile to the Christian name". [[Pope Gregory XI]] in letter from 1372 for [[Franciscan Province of Bosna Srebrena|Franciscans in Bosnia]] ordered to convert Vlachs who live in tents and pastures (''Wlachorum... quorum nonnulli in pascuis et tentoriis habitant''), also relating to the activity of the [[Bosnian Church]] (also see [[Stećak]]s). Scholar Bogumil Hrabak emphasized that there's no need to insist on the religious affiliation of the pastoralist communities in the Balkan, especially the Vlachs. Living in closed transhumance communities they changed religious affiliation according to the regional religion ([[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] or [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]) where lived for a prolonged time, and if weren't followed by the specific priest. Their ignorance and lack of Christian Church commitment are seen in the case of Vlachs who were settled in [[Žumberak]] (the 1530s), who begged commander [[Johann Katzianer]] to be Christianized. Orthodoxy as such was also more akin to them rather than feudal Roman Catholicism which dogma did not allow to embrace as many pagan beliefs like in Orthodox Church.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=336–337}}

==History==

===Middle Ages===
Reference to the existence of Vlachs or Romance-speaking people in Medieval Croatia dates from the early Middle Age; One of the first mention of Vlachs is the 1071 charter by the Croatian King Krešimir IV about the [[Rab]] diocese, when on the island of [[Pag (island)|Pag]] was mentioned the village ''Wlasici'' (today village Vlašići),{{sfn|Botica|2005|p=37}}&lt;ref name="Prezimenik I"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Odredba i potvrda kralja Petra Krešimira IV. o području Rapske biskupije| url=http://arhinet.arhiv.hr/_DigitalniArhiv/Monumenta/HR-HDA-876-7.htm| publisher=ARHiNET| language=Latin, Croatian| accessdate=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is considered a forgery from the late 12th and early 13th century.{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=220}} In the ''Libellus Policorion'', church cartular dated in the mid 14th century that includes transcriptions of older collected documents about estates of now extinct Benedictine Abbey of St John the Evangelist in [[Biograd na Moru|Biograd]] and Saints Cosmas and Damian on the island of [[Pašman]], is mentioned one ''Kutun'' (Katun) district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Zur Ethnographie von Dalmatien (O etnografiji Dalmacije)| last=Bidermann| first=Ignaz Hermann| publisher=Österreichisch-ungarische Revue (translated Josip Vergil Perić)| year=1889| pages=23| language=Serbo-Croatian| url=http://www.mo-vrebac-pavlovac.hr/attachments/article/181/Hermann%20Ignaz%20Bidermann-O%20etnografiji%20Dalmacije%20-%202.%20dio.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vlachs can be traced by personal names and peculiarly by ending suffix "-ul" in Dalmatian cities documents since the 10th century.{{sfn|Botica|2005|p=37}}&lt;ref name="Prezimenik I"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Konstatin Jireček| title=Romani u gradovima Dalmacije tokom srednjega veka| publisher=SANU| location=Beograd| year=1962| volume=II| pages=45–48| language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Morlachia.jpg|thumb|Morlach region in the 17th century.]]
The first collective reference of Vlachs, or [[Morlachs]] in some Latin and mostly Venetian and Italian documents, dates from the early 1320s (almost 900 years after Slavic migration); in 1321, a local priest from [[Dobrinj]] on the island of [[Krk]] granted land to the church ("to the lands of Kneže, which are called Vlachian"),{{sfn|Mužić (Vjekoslav Klaić)|2010|p=10 (I)|ps=: ''i pašišća… do zemlje Kneže, ke se zovu vlaške''}} while in 1322 they and people of [[Republic of Poljica|Poljica]] were allied to Ban of Croatia, [[Mladen II Šubić of Bribir|Mladen Šubić]], who fought against Croatian pretenders at the [[Battle of Bliska]] in the hinterland of [[Trogir]].{{sfn|Mužić (Vjekoslav Klaić)|2010|p=10 (II)|ps=: ''auxilio Vlacorum et Policianorum''}}{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=102–103}} In 1344 are mentioned ''Morolacorum'' in lands around [[Knin]] and [[Krbava]], within the conflict of counts from Kurjaković and [[Nelipić noble family|Nelipić]] families, and that they can shelter their livestock on islands of Rab, [[Hvar]], and [[Brač]].{{sfn|Mužić (Vjekoslav Klaić)|2010|p=10, 11|ps=: ''Et insuper mittemus specialem nuntium….

In 1352, in the agreement in which [[Zadar]] sold salt to the [[Republic of Venice]], in which Zadar retained part of the salt that ''Morlachi'' and others exported by land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Listine o odnošajih Južnoga Slavenstva i Mletačke Republike|publisher=JAZU|location=Zagreb|volume=III|year=1872|page=237|quote=Prvi se put spominje ime »Morlak« (Morlachi) 1352 godine, 24. lipnja, u pogodbi po kojoj zadarsko vijeće prodaje sol Veneciji, gdje Zadar zadržava dio soli koju Morlaci i drugi izvoze, kopnenim putem.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mužić (Vjekoslav Klaić)|2010|p=11 (I)|ps=: ''Detractis modiis XII. milie salis predicti quolibet anno que remaneant in Jadra pro usu Jadre et districtu, et pro exportatione solita fieri per Morlachos et alios per terram tantum…''}} In the 1357 charter of [[Šibenik]] was imposed a provision that Vlachs mustn't use without authority the city lands for pasture.{{sfn|Mužić (Vjekoslav Klaić)|2010|p=11 (II)|ps=: ''Item Vlahi vel Villani in districtu ipsius civitatis, absque, licentia et voluntate civium pascua ipsorum seu gramina depascere non possint.''}} In 1362, the ''Morlachorum'', unauthorized, settled on lands of [[Trogir]] but were allowed to use it for pasture for a few months.{{sfn|Mužić (Vjekoslav Klaić)|2010|p=12|ps=: ''quedam particula gentis Morlachorum ipsius domini nostri regis... tentoria (tents), animalia seu pecudes (sheep)... ut ipsam particulam gentis Morlachorum de ipsorum territorio repellere… dignaremur (to be repelled from city territory)... quamplures Morlachos... usque ad festum S. Georgii martiris (was allowed to stay until April 24, 1362).''}}

In 1383, Vlachs around Šibenik, which partially belonged to the Queen [[Elizabeth of Bosnia|Elizabeth]] and noble [[Ivan III Nelipac|Ivan III Nelipić]], were causing problems, and citizens wrote to the Queen asking for help. The Queen warned the Ban of Croatia, Emerik, and ordered him to send Vlachs away from the city lands and take fines from them, from which a part to be given to the citizens.{{sfn|Mužić (Vjekoslav Klaić)|2010|p=13 (I)|ps=: ''noveritis nos percepisse, qualiter Olahi tam nostri, quam Joannis filii Ivan Nyelpecy de Zetina, multa dampna, nocumenta, homicidia ac spolia in districtu civitatis antedicte fecissent et continue facere non cessarent, in eo videlicet, quod dicti Olahi venientes ad territorium et districtum dicte nostre civitatis pascua ipsius civitatis occupando, offen siones, interemtiones, ac alia facta nephanda perpetrarent potentialiter.''}} In 1387, when nobles from the family Budislavić from Krbava confirmed with a charter the privileges of the citizens of city Pag, was determined that Vlachs musn't use the city lands for pasture.{{sfn|Mužić (Vjekoslav Klaić)|2010|p=13 (II)|ps=: ''Ut nullus Vallachus vel alter quicunque ali qualiter sit ausus infra dictas metas manere vel pascere aliqua animalia, seu facere aliquod laborarium, sub pena librarum centum...''}} In the Statute of [[Senj]] dating to 1388, the [[House of Frankopan|Frankopan]]s mentioned ''Morowlachi'' and defined the amount of time they had for pasture around river Gacka when they descended from the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=67009| author=L.

[[File:Stećak ploča.JPG|thumb|Example of Vlach/Morlach medieval tombstone]]
Some scholars consider that to the alleged Vlachian migration in the 14th century to the [[Zagora (Croatia)|Dalmatian Zagora]] preceded [[black death]] which enabled permanent Vlachian colonization and pasture of animals on desolated land.{{sfn|Botica|2005|p=39}} This migration would be followed with the sudden appearance of [[stećak]] tombstones in the Cetina county, showing the cultural specificity of the newly arrived communities. The particular appearance of the stećaks indicate separate socio-cultural identity, to whom afterlife was important, as well socio-professional prosperity for such valuable burials.{{sfn|Botica|2005|p=39}} According to others, such a sudden appearance of the Vlachian name in the historical documents is due to the official introduction of specific rights in the notary books for taxation and trade only from 1307.{{sfn|Botica|2005|p=44}}

In the 1376 and 1454 documents by [[Republic of Ragusa|Republic of Dubrovnik]] about trade with Bosnian lands are distinguished ''Vlachi et Bosgnani''.{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=230}} In Bosnian documents are first mentioned in c. 1234 by ban [[Matej Ninoslav]], and from 1361 up to 1417 were mentioned royal Vlachs of Bosnian bans and kings.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=319}}{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=230-231}}

On 13 April 1411, [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnian]] Duke [[Sandalj Hranić]] sold the Croatian town [[Ostrovica, Croatia|Ostrovica]], which was a gift from King [[Ladislaus of Naples]] to the Republic of Venice. A year later on 10 April 1412, the ''Murlachos'' (probably in service of King [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]]) captured the [[Ostrovica Fortress]] from Venice.{{sfn|Mužić (Vjekoslav Klaić)|2010|p=13 (III)|ps=: ''Cum rectores Jadre scripserint nostro dominio, quod castrum Ostrovich, quod emimusa Sandalo furatum et acceptum sit per certos Murlachos, quod non est sine infamia nostri dominii...''}} In August 1417, Venetian authorities were concerned with the "Morlachs and other Slavs" from the hinterland, that were a threat to security in [[Šibenik]].{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=115}}

During the 15th century, the Vlach population in Croatia expanded so significantly that they were sometimes mentioned as a distinct entity along the Croatians. In 1412 King Sigismund bestowed the [[Sinj]] county and [[Potravlje Fortress|Travnik]] fortress to Ivan III Nelipić, and mentioned that Croats and Vlachs were at his disposal (''cum universis Croatis et Vlahis'').{{sfn|Mužić (Vjekoslav Klaić)|2010|p=14}}{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=130}} In the so-called Pašman Breviary (1431) were distinguished Croats and Vlachs enslaved by the Turks.{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=130}} On 6 August 1432, the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusians]] reported to King Sigismund that the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] had invaded into the Croatian lands, and captured many Croats and Vlachs.{{sfn|Mužić (Vjekoslav Klaić)|2010|p=14 (I)|ps=: ''Qui Teucri bis Crohatie fines hostiliter invaserunt, predatique fuerunt ibidem magnam praedam Crohatorum videlicet et Vlacorum ibidem permanentium.''}} In 1432, on the order of King Sigismund, Morlachs were required for military service and to gather at the Ban's camp where they were joined by the "whole of the Croatian Kingdom and co-existing forces of the Vlachs".{{sfn|Klaić|1973|p=16-18}} In 1433 was released document which defined relation between "good Vlachs" and Church of St. Ivan in Gori in Lika, mentioning Vlach judicial court, and that "not one Vlach among us brother Croat Vlachs will carry out any evil on the said property".{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=130}}

The sale of [[Dalmatia]] on 7 April 1433 by King Sigismund to the [[Republic of Venice]] earned him the enmity of [[Ivan Frankopan]]. With death of last Nelipić in 1435,{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=52}} Frankopan convinced the Vlachs to side with him by promising them the resurrection of old "Vlach Laws" (previously given by Nelipić's) on 18 March 1436. These laws dated from the middle of the 14th century and included many personal rights for the Vlachs.{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=24-26}} According to the "Vlach Laws", Vlachs that chose to follow Frankopan received various privileges, such as serving under Vlach commanders instead of Croatian ones, crimes committed in the town of Sinj would be judged by a Vlach magistrate rather than a Croatian one,{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=130}} the Croatian prince of Cetina would not be permitted to appoint a [[voivode]] (prince) over them {{sfn|Van Antwerp Fine|2006|p=130}} and Croats were restricted to having only one Vlach as their shepherd. Encouraged by these promises, the Vlachs attacked nearby littoral towns under Venetian control, but in 1436 on behalf of king Sigismund, Ban of Croatia [[Matko Talovac]] waged war against Ivan Frankopan who didn't manage to survive.{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=52}}{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=24-26}}

As they previously supported Frankopan, Vlachs from Cetina now were persecuted, resulting on 2 July 1436 informing the Vlachs of a peace treaty between Talovac and Venice that had been signed that forbade further attacks on Venetian towns, but it wasn't always respected.{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=52}}{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=24-26}} The persecution was also in part due to the new conflict between Talovac and herzog [[Stjepan Vukčić Kosača]] who at the time had capital in [[Imotski]]. Kosača managed to conquer in 1440 [[Omiš]] and [[Poljica (Dalmatia)|Poljica]], but lost them to Venice in 1444. From this time are dated [[stećak]]s from [[Bisko]]. In 1444 conflicts between Talovac and Vlachs again re-emerge, with estates of Vlachs Mikul Dudanović, Radoj Gerdanić and their siblings being given to the widow of Šimun [[House of Keglević|Keglević]]. This resulted with the migration of Morlachs from the Talovac estates in Cetina to Poljica under Venice control in 1446.{{sfn|Milošević|1991|p=53}}

The Vlachs of Lika, who were predominantly [[Catholic]],{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=21}} were ruled by Croatian princes and bishops, while Vlachs who lived along the [[Cetina]] river were more autonomous and were governed by Vlach princes, dukes and judges. They also paid more favorable taxes and were free from paying for pasture for their cattle. However, they were not completely free citizens and faced restrictions such as prohibitions on becoming court witnesses, jurors and officers. Their rights were contained in the "Vlach Paper" from 1476, which itself is an extension of the "Vlach Laws" from 1436. Both of these were written in [[Cyrillic letter|Cyrillic]] and kept in the Franciscan monastery in [[Trsat]].{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=26-27}} Also, during this period, large numbers of Vlachs were traded or used as gifts between Croatian nobles, and local churches.{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=15-22}}

Another group or Vlachian term besides Morlachs was ''[[Ćići]]'' (ger. Tschitsche).

===Ottoman conquest and Austrian Empire===
Vlach migrations to the Austrian Empire from the Ottoman Empire, and vice versa, were generally caused by the loss of financial status or privileges of [[Vlach law]]s,{{sfn|Roksandić|1991|p=20}} rather than from any form of ethnic or religious persecution.{{sfn|Suppan|Graf|2010|p=59}} Usually the migrations were caused or performed in periods after turbulent events, like [[Battle of Mohács]] (1526), the conquest of Dalmatia (1522), Lika and Krbava (1527-28), and subsequent battles.{{sfn|Roksandić|1991|p=19}} Many Vlachs served in Ottoman armies during their conquests.{{sfn|Suppan|Graf|2010|p=59}} As part of the military, they often served either as light cavalry or infantrymen, or irregular soldiers (''[[martolos]]i'').{{sfn|Roksandić|1991|p=45}} However, since the movements of large Ottoman armies towards Inner Austria were rarely routed through [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]], and military actions were focused on the vicinity of [[Jajce]] and [[Bihać]], the role of the [[Uskok]]-Vlachs spying on the Ottomans was particularly important.{{sfn|Suppan|Graf|2010|p=61}}

The Serb-Vlach colonization of [[Žumberak]] started between 1530 and 1538,{{sfn|Roksandić|1991|p=20–21}} at the same time when in Ottoman-conquered lands Vlachs laws were cancelled until 1550, partially or altogether, causing migration because of social and financial status.{{sfn|Roksandić|1991|pp=20, 45}} In June 1531, around 1,000 Vlachs, advised by Ivan Katzianer, settled in [[Kostel, Croatia|Kostel]] and [[Polajna]], along the [[Kupa]] River near Žumberak, of which 700 were fit for military service.{{sfn|Suppan|Graf|2010|p=60}} King [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] in September 1538 responded to general commander Nikola Jurišić, who informed him about some Servian or Rascian captains and dukes who are willing to come with their people to serve in military service, that they were given privileges.{{sfn|Roksandić|1991|p=20}} In October of the same year Jurišić informed the King that the Ban [[Petar Keglević]] and other nobles came from Ottoman-conquered territory with many ''Sirfen'' (Serbs). In the same letter, Jurišić informed the king about the Vlachs who "in our (Croatian) parts are called as Old Romans" (''alt Römer genennt''),{{sfn|Roksandić|1991|p=20}} and that came with others from Turkish parts, to be given the same promises and privileges which were given to the Serbs.{{sfn|Roksandić|1991|p=20}} In November, Ferdinand wrote to Keglević about ''"captains and dukes of the Rasians, or the Serbs, or the Vlachs, who are commonly called the Serbs"''{{sfn|Roksandić|1991|p=20}} (''capitanei et wayuode Rasciani sive Serviani atque Valachi, quos vulgo zrbschy vocant''). Serbs from Cetina part of the 1538 migration were taken care of by captain of Bihać Erazmo Thurn and his men, Croatian Ban [[Petar Keglević]], and counts of Slunj, [[House of Zrinski|Zrinski]], and Blagaj.{{sfn|Roksandić|1991|p=21}} Military service becomes the main occupation of the new population.{{sfn|Roksandić|1991|p=21}}

[[File:Croatian Military Frontier-1868.png|thumb|[[Croatian Military Frontier]] in 1868.]]
In 1530, Vlachs from Lika and Srb, [[Unac (river)|Unac]] and [[Glamoč]] came under Turkish rule.{{sfn|Mužić (Radoslav Lopašić|2010|p=46|ps: Walachi Turcorum, qui commoraverunt in Zerb et in Unatz et in Glamoch}} Catholic Vlachs in Prilišće and Rosopajnik settled in 1538, while in 1544 came under the protection of [[Nikola Šubić Zrinski]].{{sfn|Mužić (Radoslav Lopašić|2010|p=46}} Around 1530, in lands of Stjepan Frankopan from Ozalj, in Otok and Hreljin, were settled some Vlachs who in 1540 were mentioned for rewarding by King Ferdinand because of successful spying on Turks.{{sfn|Mužić (Radoslav Lopašić|2010|p=46}} With the growing number of the Ottoman Vlachs passing over the Christian side, the Vlach leader from Glamoč, Ladislav Stipković, traveled to Ljubljana to offer his service, and those of his forces, to the Austrians. In a later battle, the combined forces of the army from Bihać and the Vlachs defeated an Ottoman army at Bihać.{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=34-35}}

In 1551, general [[Ivan Lenković]] reported to Ferdinand how Turks settled thousands of Morlachs and Vlachs around [[Srb]], and ''Kosovo field'' near the town of Knin.{{sfn|Mužić (Radoslav Lopašić|2010|p=33}} In 1560, the towns of Lišnica and [[Novigrad na Dobri|Novigrad]] along with large parts of the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] valley, Bušević and the Krupa river, were captuered, and settled with newcomers from Bosnia.{{sfn|Mužić (Radoslav Lopašić|2010|p=33}} In 1560, some Vlachs were settled around [[Ivanić-Grad]], [[Križevci, Croatia|Križevci]] and [[Koprivnica]].{{sfn|Mužić (Radoslav Lopašić|2010|p=47}}

Orthodox Vlachs were also directed to settle in Lika when Arnaud Memi-Bey became commander of Lika [[Sanjak]].{{sfn|Mužić (Radoslav Lopašić|2010|p=34}} The [[Beylerbey]] of Bosnia, [[Hasan Predojević|Hasan-Pasha Predojević]], himself an Islamized Orthodox "Vlach" from [[Herzegovina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Croats and Serbs: Two Old and Different Nations, p. 145:|author=[[Dominik Mandić]]}} {{quote|After the fall of Bihać in 1592 the Bosnian Beylerbey Hasan Pasha Predojević settled Orthodox Vlachs from Eastern Herzegovina, especially those of his own Predojević clan, in the central part of Pounje around Brekovica, Ripač, Ostrovica and Vrla Draga up to Sokolovac.}}&lt;/ref&gt; received the support of these Orthodox Vlachs and many served in his armies. At Predojević's order, Vlachs, as well as some Turkish nobility, settled near the towns [[Brekovica]], Ripča, [[Ostrvice]] and Vrla Draga near [[Sokolac]] in such numbers that they formed a significant population of this region.{{sfn|Mužić (Radoslav Lopašić|2010|p=34}} In 1579, Vlachs in Turkish service wanted to transfer the towns of [[Cazin]] and [[Ostrožac, Cazin|Ostrožac]] to ''Christian'', that is Croatian, ownership.{{sfn|Mužić (Radoslav Lopašić|2010|p=34}} In 1599, many Vlachs emigrated from [[Korenica]] and [[Turkish Croatia|Bihać area]] to Gomirje.{{sfn|Mužić (Radoslav Lopašić|2010|p=34}}

In 1585, the general from Karlovac, Josip Turn, proposed Vlach settlement in [[Moravice, Croatia|Moravice]], and later in 1597 general Lenković led Vlachs from Lika to [[Gorski Kotar]] and lands owned by Frankopan family.{{sfn|Mužić (Radoslav Lopašić|2010|p=48}} In Frankopan estate arrived yet again in 1609, and 1632.{{sfn|Mužić (Radoslav Lopašić|2010|p=48}} In 1605, General Vid Kisel brought Vlachs from Ostrožac to [[Ogulin]] and Bosiljevac, and some time later, Vlachs from Uzorac and Turje settled in [[Karlovac]].{{sfn|Mužić (Radoslav Lopašić|2010|p=34}} In 1609, two burgs, Brlog and Gusić-Grad, were given by Senj captain and Croatian nobleman Sigismund Gusić to accommodate newly arrived Vlachs in exchange for their military service.{{sfn|Mužić (Radoslav Lopašić|2010|p=52}} In 1639, Nikola Frankopan of [[Tržac (Cazin)|Tržac]] accused Senj captain Albrecht Herberstein of settling Catholic Vlachs (Bunjevci) at his deserted estates in [[Jablanac]], [[Starigrad, Lika-Senj County|Starigrad]], and Orthodox Vlachs in [[Brinje]] and Brlog, without his permission.{{sfn|Mužić (Radoslav Lopašić|2010|p=52}} The same happened with Zrinski in [[Ledenice]].{{sfn|Mužić (Radoslav Lopašić|2010|p=52}} Under Ottomans during the bishopric of Marcijan Lišnjić (1661–86) around Blato and Broćno/Brotnjo in Herzegovina were mentioned "Croatian Vlachs".{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=367}}

After the Ottomans were defeated in Vienna in 1683, the Vlachs scattered throughout the [[Croatian Military Frontier]]. Concerned about this, Turks decided to settle them on the south side of the Una river, but were unable to execute this plan.{{sfn|Mužić (Radoslav Lopašić|2010|p=34}} During this period, Ottomans were vulnerable to Vlach raids from [[Banija]] and [[Karlovac]]. Vlachs, under the protection of the Ban of Croatia [[Miklós Erdődy]] and General Ivan Josip Herberstein, were also settled around [[Petrinja]], [[Glina, Croatia|Glina]], [[Skradin]], [[Vojnić]], Krstinje and [[Velika Gorica|Budačko]].{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=34}} After the [[magnate conspiracy]] (1670), executions and confiscation of Frankopan and Zrinski families estate, Vlachs were settled under permission of Frontier generals.{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=48-49}} The abandoned village of [[Plaški]] was settled in 1666, while 120 families settled below the [[Krnjak|Budački]] fortress, in {{circa}} 200 houses between [[Skrad]], [[Slunj]], Veljun, and Blagaj in 1686.{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=49}} With the liberation of Lika and Krbava in 1689, Vlachs from [[Kupres]], [[Bosansko Grahovo|Grahovo]] and Plavno near Knin returned to the region.{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=53}} Thirty individuals from Plaški were transferred to [[Jasenice, Zadar County|Jasenice]] in 1705, and 158 families were settled in the vicinity of Budački in 1711.{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=49}} In 1791, after the [[Treaty of Sistova]], Orthodox Vlachs settled in new territory from [[Maljevac]] to Srb and the triangle border of Lika regiment, noted as the last of such migrations.{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=53}}

In the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Ban's Croatia]] Vlachs mostly settled in the 17th century.{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=50}} In 1680 around 120 families were settled. In 1688 Vlachs settled in [[Bović]], [[Gvozd|Kirin]], and Gradišće.{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=50-51}} In 1718, noblewoman Marija Magdalena Drašković settled some Vlachs on her estate between the Tršca stream and village of Utinja.{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=51}} In 1750, an Orthodox priest and witnesses confirmed Vlachs didn't exist before around Kupa, Steničnjak, [[Petrova Gora]] and Slavsko Polje, but only around [[Hrvatska Kostajnica]].{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=51-52}} They numbered around 4000 people.{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=52}}

In Slavonia, Friedrich Wilhelm von Taube wrote in the 18th century that there many Vlachs mixed with "Illyrians" (Croats and Serbs) and that have adopted their "Illyrian" (Slavic) language.{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=547}}

In Dalmatia the [[Morlachs]] were immigrants who settled in the Venetian-Ottoman border, in the hinterlands of coastal cities, and entered Venetian military service, in the late 16th and early 17th century. In 1593, provveditore generale Cristoforo Valier mentioned three nations constituting the Uskoks, the "natives of Senj, Croatians, and Morlachs from the Turkish parts".{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=218}} At the time of the [[Cretan War (1645–69)]] and [[Morean War|Morean War (1684-99)]], a large number of ''Morlachs'' settled inland of the Dalmatian towns, and [[Ravni Kotari]] of Zadar. According to Venetian censuses, in 1761, Orthodox Christians were 31,211 of the total population numbering 220,287; in 1771, 38,652 out of 223,765; in 1781, 51,996 out of 236,997.{{sfn|Roksandić|1991|p=52}}

The settlement of the Vlachs in Croatia was beneficial to the Austrian Empire as the Emperor was reluctant to return the Military Frontier to Croatia.{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=150}} Further settlement of Vlachs was encouraged by the Austrian Government,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=390}} but this antagonised the [[Sabor]] (the Croatian Parliament) and resulted in the passing of various laws, on 21 February 1629, guaranteeing certain privileges to the Vlachs. For example, any Vlach willingly becoming a subject of the Kingdom of Croatia was exempt from becoming a [[serf]], rendering Vlachs almost equal with native Croatians. The laws enacted by the Emperor of the Austrian Empire and Sabor are collectively known as ''[[Statuta Valachorum]]''. The exemption of the Vlachs from serfdom can be compared to the same exemption for native Croats, which was not applied until 1848 during the rule of [[Josip Jelačić]].{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=150-151}} To ensure cooperation from the Vlachs, Austrian generals conducted a propaganda campaign focusing on Vlach serfdom under Croatian rule. This activity prevented the Croatian envoy to the Austrian court, [[Benedikt Vinković]], who was there to consult on the "Vlach question", from pursuing a union of the Vlach-settled Military Frontier with Croatia.{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=150}}

Jaroslav Šidak noted that due to receiving derogatory connotation, in ''Historija naroda Jugoslavije II'' (1959) the issue was tried to be avoided by writing lowercase "vlachs".{{sfn|Mirdita|2009|p=159}} Some international scholars like [[Noel Malcolm]] consider that Bosnian Serbs have a large element of non-Slavic ancestry (mainly Vlachs), and national concepts of Croats and Serbs are 19th- and 20th century constructs.&lt;ref name="Fowkes2002"/&gt;{{not in citation|date=February 2018}}

Some older sources like, [[Belsazar Hacquet]] (1739–1815) noted that although some call the Vlachs as Serbs, the Croats are their actual descendants.{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=551}} In the work ''About the Vlachs'' from 1806, Metropolitan [[Stevan Stratimirović]] stated that Roman Catholics from Croatia and Slavonia scornfully used the name Vlach for ''"the Slovenians (Slavs) and Serbs, who are of our, Eastern confession (Orthodoxy)"'', and that ''"the Turks in Bosnia and Serbia also call every Bosnian or Serbian Christian a Vlach"''.{{sfn|Mirdita|2009|p=161}} Scholars like [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]], [[Ferdo Šišić]], [[Vjekoslav Klaić]], [[Petar Skok]], vaguely argued according to the ideologies of the time, that the Vlachs lacked national consciousness, belonging to Serbs or Croats, that Orthodoxy made them Serbs, or that due to them being mainly Orthodox the Roman Catholic priests started to identify them with the Serbs/[[Rascians]] which eventually got adopted.{{sfn|Mirdita|2009|p=159–163}}

The dispersion of Orthodox Slavs (Vlachs and Serbs) in present-day territory of Croatia, who mostly inhabited the historical borderland Military Frontier (''Krajina''), were a cultural, linguistical, and political factor used by extreme ideologies from both Serbia and Croatia.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=333}} Drago Roksandić and Marko Šarić noted that the modern South Slavic national revival and historiography since 19th century tried to see and interpret its own national history through present day situation, like an "ethnocentric mirror that shows the present".{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=331}} The picture they tried to give about the Vlachs was most commonly simplified, uncritical and acted constructed,{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=333}} resulting with historiographic disputes.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=26}}

In Serbian historiography all Dinaric/Shtokavian cultural attributes were without exception proclaimed as being Serb,{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=333}} and also often stressed the ethno-demographic discontinuity wanting to prove that the Croatian Military Frontier lost its original Croat population and received a new, ethnically Serb majority population, and also downplayed Croat and overemphasized the importance of the Serbs in the history of the Military Frontier.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=334}} Serbian historiography strongly considered that the term Vlach indicated status and not ethnos, and that they didn't exist in later centuries as an ethnic group, yet were true Serbs.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=43}} [[Sima Ćirković]] noted that the name was maintained due to different crafts, way of life and distinct form of social organization, until the differences lost their meaning, with Slavicization process lasting for centuries; he considered that Serbs absorbed many Vlachs and other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|pp=26–27}} Many Serbian scholars, including foreign, claim that the settlers in the Military Frontier were Serbs or mainly Serbs.&lt;ref name=Trbovich&gt;{{cite book|author=Ana S.

The Croats have always resented the rights granted to Serbs in Croatia, and most especially Krayina's historic separate existence. Croat historians have claimed that Krayina's settlers were not Serbs but “Vlachs,”81 [footnote:] While all Orthodox settlers were indeed called Vlachs by the Habsburg authorities, and some truly were Vlachs and different from the Serbs, the majority were Serbian and even the Vlachs assimilated into Serbs by the nineteenth century. As Nicholas Miller explains, “the term Vlach became a weapon in the war to devalue Serbian claims to territory and history in Croatia.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Béla K.

The Statuta defined the rights and obligations of frontiersmen and provided the first formal administrative organization for the Military Frontier, which was now detached from Croatia. ... The term Vlach was often used interchangeably with Serb because the latter, too, were mostly a pastoral people.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthodox Vlach groups whose migrations were not accompanied by an ecclesiastical infrastructure were Catholicised and assimilated. According to Marko Šarić the Serb identity was finalized among the Orthodox Vlachs in Lika and Krbava after the establishment of the Serbian Orthodox eparchies of Zrinopolje and Lika-Krbava in 1695, which would be later unified into the [[Eparchy of upper Karlovac]].{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=340-341}} He noted that the Catholic Vlachs (i.e. [[Bunjevci]]) were integrated into the Croatian nation.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=333}}

In recent decades, the extent in which Orthodox Slavs (Vlachs and Serbs) lived in previous centuries (Military Frontier, Srijem, Baranja etc.) by Serb separatists was seen as a borderline between Croatia and self-proclaimed autonomous regions within Croatian territory, the [[SAO Krajina]], [[SAO Western Slavonia]] and [[SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia]], and eventual [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (1991-1995), during the Croatian international recognition and [[Croatian War of Independence|War in Croatia]] which lasted from 1991 until 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Drago Roksandić| title=Srbi u hrvatskoj i srpskoj historiografiji:  problemi usporedbe dvije interpretacijske tradicije| publisher=Dijalog povjesničara-istoričara| volume=5| location=Zagreb| year=2002| pages=211–230| language=Croatian| url=http://www.cpi.hr/download/links/hr/7075.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Drago Roksandić| title=Srbi u Hrvatskoj (1989-1991): Između lojalnosti, neposlušnosti i pobune| publisher=[[Neposlušnost (book); Narodna biblioteka Srbije (publisher)|Neposlušnost (book); Narodna biblioteka Srbije]]| volume=Edition Rizom, book 6| location=Beograd| year=2011| pages=87–120| language=Serbo-Croatian| url=http://www.ffzg.unizg.hr/pov/zavod/triplex2/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ROKSANDIC_2011_87-120.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croatian historian Drago Roksandić claimed in 1991, before the war escalated, that until today, the "Vlach question" (''Vlaško pitanje'') had caused and still caused many disagreements between experts and non-experts in ex-Yugoslavian countries, as well as in the other Balkan countries with Vlach communities.{{sfn|Roksandić|1991|p=15}} The Vlach heritage has had a remarkable impact on modern Serbs, Croats and Bosnians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gabor Agoston |author2=Bruce Alan Masters |title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire |year=2010 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |pages=585 |isbn=9781438110257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wa''' (Va) is the language of the [[Wa people]] of [[Burma]] and [[China]]. There are three distinct varieties, sometimes considered separate languages; their names in ''Ethnologue'' are '''Parauk''', the majority and standard form; '''Vo''' (Zhenkang Wa, 40,000 speakers), and '''Awa''' (100,000 speakers), though all may be called ''Wa, Awa, Va, Vo''. David Bradley (1994) estimates there are total of 820,000 Wa speakers.

==Distribution and variants==
[[Gerard Diffloth]] refers to the Wa geographic region as the "Wa corridor", which lies between the [[Salween River|Salween]] and [[Mekong River]]s. According to Diffloth, variants include South Wa, "Bible Wa", and Kawa (Chinese Wa).

Christian Wa are more likely to support the use of Standard Wa, since their Bible is based on a standard version of Wa, which is in turn based on the variant spoken in [[Bang Wai]], 150 miles north of [[Kengtung]] (Watkins 2002). Bang Wai is located in northern [[Shan State]], [[Burma]], close to the Chinese border where [[Cangyuan County]] is located.

Certain dialects of Wa preserve a final -/s/. They include the variants spoken in Meung Yang and [[Ximeng County]] (such as a variety spoken in Zhongke 中课, Masan 马散, [[Ximeng County]] that was documented by Zhou &amp; Yan (1984)) (Watkins 2002:8).

===Burma===
David Bradley (1994) estimates that there is a total of about 500,000 Wa speakers in [[Burma]].

A small number of Wa speakers also reside in [[Taunggyi]], [[Mandalay]], and [[Yangon]].

===China===
The PRC writing system for Wa is based on the Wa variant in Aishuai, [[Cangyuan County]], [[Yunnan]].

David Bradley (1994) estimates that there are 322,000 Wa speakers in China. In China, the [[Wa people]] live in (Watkins 2002):

*[[Ximeng County]] (83% of total)
*[[Cangyuan County]] (71% of total)
*[[Menglian County]] (over 25% of total; other ethnic groups include the [[Dai people|Dai]] and [[Lahu people|Lahu]])
*[[Gengma County]]
*[[Shuangjiang County]]
*[[Lancang County]]

A small number of Wa speakers also reside in [[Kunming]] and throughout various parts of [[Yunnan]].

The three dialects of Wa (and their respective subdialects) according to Zhou, et al. (2004) are:&lt;ref&gt;Zhou Zhizhi [周植志], Yan Qixiang [颜其香], Chen Guoqing [陈国庆]. 2004. ''A study of Wa dialects'' [佤语方言硏究]. Beijing: Ethnic Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Kela'' 克拉 (Dai exonym: Kala 卡拉; population: 393 people) live in District 3 三区 of [[Tengchong County]] 腾冲县, Yunnan (You 2013:359).&lt;ref name="You2013"&gt;You Weiqiong [尤伟琼]. 2013. ''Classifying ethnic groups of Yunnan'' [云南民族识别研究]. Beijing: Ethnic Publishing House [民族出版社].&lt;/ref&gt; The Kela used to speak a variety of Wa, but now speak only Chinese. The Kela also refer to themselves as the ''Wama'' 佤妈.&lt;ref name="Yunnan1960"/&gt;

===Thailand===
Wa have also migrated to Thailand in the past several decades, mainly from Burma. There are about 10,000 Wa speakers in Thailand. Wa villages can be found in (Watkins 2002:6):

*[[Mae Sai District]], [[Chiang Rai Province]], close to the Burmese border
*[[Mae Yao]] subdistrict near [[Chiang Rai City]]
*[[Wiang Pa Pao District]], in southern Chiang Rai Province
*[[Chiang Dao District]], [[Chiang Mai Province]]

==Phonology==
Standard Wa is a non-tonal language. However, tone has developed in some of the dialects. There is correspondence between tones in tonal dialects and tenseness in non-tonal dialects.&lt;ref name=wyyj/&gt;

In Wa, there are 44 phonemes;&lt;ref name="Ma"&gt;[http://ic.payap.ac.th/graduate/linguistics/theses/Seng_Mai_Thesis.pdf Ma Seng Mai, ''A Descriptive Grammar of Wa'']&lt;/ref&gt; 35 consonants&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ixpO4NZD2gkC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=%22wa+language%22+number+of+speakers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-uBMrbZ24c&amp;sig=_S7OnibIX-oa5Og8jafni0oQeUI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wc0FVOzJHo-RuASz84HwAg&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22wa%20language%22%20number%20of%20speakers&amp;f=false Steve Parker, ed. ''The Sonority Controversy''. p. 154]&lt;/ref&gt; and 9 vowels. All of these vowels can be tense or lax. Tenseness is a phonemic feature in syllables with unaspirated initials.&lt;ref name=wyyj&gt;"佤语研究", edited by 王敬骝.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Script==
[[File:Wa4886.JPG|thumb|Wa writing and cultural symbols on a T-shirt]]
The Wa language formerly had no script and some of the few Wa that were literate used [[Chinese characters]], while others used the [[Shan language]] and its script. [[Christianity|Christian]] missionary work among the Wa began at the beginning of the 20th century first in the Burmese and later in the Chinese areas of the Wa territory. It was led by William Marcus Young, from [[Nebraska]]. The first transcription of the Wa language was devised by Young and Sara Yaw Shu Chin (Joshua) in 1931 with the purpose of [[Bible translations|translating the Bible]]. This first Wa alphabet was based on the [[Latin script]] and the very first publication was a compilation of Wa [[hymn]]s in 1933,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humancomp.org/wadict/young_family.html The Young Family’s Work with the Wa People]&lt;/ref&gt; the Wa [[New Testament]] being completed in 1938. This transcription, known as '''Bible orthography''', is known as lǎowǎwén 老佤文 '''old Wa orthography''' in Chinese, and is now used mainly in the Burmese Wa areas and among the Wa in Thailand through the materials published by the Wa Welfare Society ''(Cub Yuh Bwan Ka son Vax, Cub Pa Yuh Phuk Lai Vax, Phuk Lai Hak Tiex Vax)'' in [[Chiang Mai]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humancomp.org/wadict/wa_bibliography.html A Bibliography of materials in or about Wa language and culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, a transcription adapted to the new [[pinyin]] [[romanization]], known as '''new Wa orthography''', "PRC orthography" or "Chinese orthography", was developed for the Wa people in China. However, its publications, mainly propagated through the Yunnan administration, are yet to reach a wider public beyond academics. This transcription, which originally included even a couple of letters of the [[Cyrillic script]], has also since been revised. Despite the revisions, both the Chinese and the Bible orthography are still marred by inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humancomp.org/wadict/wa_orthography.html SOAS - Writing of the Wa Language]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, a revised Bible orthography adpoting some features from the Chinese orthography has been adopted as '''Wa State Wa orthography''' or "official Wa spelling" by the central authorities of the [[Wa State]] in [[Pangkham]] which have published a series of primers in order to improve the literacy of the [[United Wa State Army]] troops. Also, after 2000 Wa people in social networks such as [[Facebook]], as well as Wa songwriters in [[karaoke]] lyrics of Wa songs, use this Myanmar (revised Bible) orthography in its main variations.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Watkins, ''Wa Dictionary'', 2 vols.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2862">The '''Zay''' are a small ethnic group of about 15,000 people in [[Ethiopia]].  “Zay” comes from a Hebrew word, Zayin, one of the twenty-two names for God. Oromo  refer  to  the  Zay  as '''Laqi''' meaning  “stirrer”  or  “paddler”. When  the  Oromo  first  saw the  Zay  on  their  boats  they  did  not  know  what  they  were  doing  and  knew  only  the  stirring motion they made with their paddles. Zay people live on the islands of [[Lake Zway]], south of [[Addis Ababa]], and engage mainly in [[fishing]]. The [[Zay language]] belongs to the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family. It is closely related to the Silte, Harari language, Gurage languages spoken by the neighboring [[Silte and Gurage people|Gurage]]. The Zay belong to the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]].
Local tradition suggests that the Zay people comprise three streams of people that populated the islands of Lake Ziway between the early 9th and the mid-17th centuries.&lt;ref name="giday" /&gt; It is believed that the 
Zay people spoke the ancient [[Harla]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braukamper|first1=Ulrich|title=Islamic History and Culture in South Ethiopia|publisher=LITverlag|page=18|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=HGnyk8Pg9NgC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=gurageland+harala&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sZCpOdhsWH&amp;sig=9ThpLFqdKpCznUeX5CQHd1KpMMk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwil_MzWtsLNAhVo5oMKHYVMDPgQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=gurageland%20harala&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zay economy is mainly based on [[subsistence agriculture]] and [[artisanal fishing|traditional fishing]].&lt;ref name="giday" /&gt; The Zay people cultivate maize, sorghum, finger millet, teff, pepper and barley, and raise cattle, goats, sheep, donkeys and chicken.&lt;ref name="giday" /&gt; Island dwellers use papyrus boats for transport, while those on the shore use donkeys and horses.&lt;ref name="giday" /&gt; Common health issues include malaria, schistosomiasis, diarrhoea and respiratory diseases.&lt;ref name="giday" /&gt; The Zay people generally have limited access to modern health care and primarily rely on medicinal plants, although (as elsewhere in the country) environmental and cultural factors threaten both medicinal plants and traditional medical knowledge.&lt;ref name="giday" /&gt;
