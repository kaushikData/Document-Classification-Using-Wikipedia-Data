An '''ant colony''' is the basic unit around which [[ant]]s organize their lifecycle.&lt;ref name="TheAnts"/&gt; Ant colonies are [[eusocial]], and are very much like those found in other social [[Hymenoptera]], though the various groups of these developed sociality independently through [[convergent evolution]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The typical colony consists of one or more [[Egg (biology)|egg]]-laying queens, a large number of sterile females (workers, soldiers) and, seasonally, a large number of winged sexual males and females.&lt;ref name="asu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://askabiologist.asu.edu/explore/secrets-superorganism|title=Ant Colony - ASU - Ask A Biologist|date=16 April 2010|website=askabiologist.asu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to establish new colonies, ants undertake nuptial flights that occur at species-characteristic times of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235556917_Seasonal_and_nocturnal_periodicities_in_ant_nuptial_flights_in_the_Tropics_Hymenoptera_Formicidae|title=Seasonal and nocturnal periodicities in ant nuptial flights in the Tropics (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swarms of the winged sexuals (known as [[alate]]s) depart the nest in search of other nests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=E.

==Names==
The term "ant colony" refers to the collections of workers, reproductive individuals, and brood that live together, cooperate, and treat one another non-aggressively. Often this comprises the genetically related progeny from a single queen, although this is not universal across ants.&lt;ref name="TheAnts"/&gt; The name "ant farm" is commonly given to ant nests that are kept in [[formicarium]]; these formicaria are formed so scientists can study by rearing or temporarily maintaining them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Word Mark: ANT FARM (renewal)|date=8 January 2009|accessdate=18 January 2014|url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn72268158&amp;docId=ACR20090109070125#docIndex=5&amp;page=1|work=United States Patent and Trademark Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Myrmecological technique. IV. Collecting ants by rearing pupae|last1=Kennedy|first1=C.H.|journal=The Ohio Journal of Science|volume=51|issue=1|year=1951|pages=17–20|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1811/3802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another name is "formicary", which derives from the [[Medieval Latin]] word ''formīcārium''. The word also derives from ''formica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Formicary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/formicary|publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Ant nests" are the physical spaces in which the ants live. These can be underground, in trees, under rocks, or even inside a single acorn.&lt;ref name="TheAnts"/&gt; The name "anthill" applies to underground nests where the workers pile sand or soil outside the entrance, forming a large mound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Claybourne|first1=A.|title=A Colony of Ants: and Other Insect Groups|date=2013|publisher=Raintree Publishers|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-1-4062-5563-8|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Colony size ==
Colony size (the number of individuals that make up the colony) is very important to ants: it can affect how they forage, how they defend their nests, how they mate, and even their physical appearances. Body size is often seen as the most important factor in shaping the natural history of non-colonial organisms; similarly, colony size is key in influencing how colonial organisms are collectively organized.&lt;ref name="burchill"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burchill|first1=A. T.|last2=Moreau|first2=C. S.|title=Colony size evolution in ants: macroevolutionary trends|journal=Insectes Sociaux|date=5 February 2016|volume=63|issue=2|pages=291–298|doi=10.1007/s00040-016-0465-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheAnts"/&gt; However, colony sizes are very different in different ant species: some are just several ants living in a twig, while others are super colonies with many millions of workers. Even looking at a single ant colony, seasonal variation can be huge. For example, in the ant ''Dolichoderus mariae'',  one colony can shift from around 300 workers in the summer to over 2,000 workers per queen in the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laskis|first1=Kristina O.|last2=Tschinkel|first2=Walter R.|title=The Seasonal Natural History of the Ant, Dolichoderus mariae, in Northern Florida|journal=Journal of Insect Science|date=February 2009|volume=9|issue=2|pages=1–26|doi=10.1673/031.009.0201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetics and environmental factors can cause the variation among colonies of a particular species to be even bigger. Zooming out further, within a related group of different ant species, the differences can be enormous: ''Formica yessensis'' has colony sizes that are reported to be 306 million workers while ''Formica fusca'' colonies sometimes comprise only 500 workers.&lt;ref name="burchill" /&gt;

== Supercolonies ==
A supercolony occurs when many ant colonies over a large area unite. They still continue to recognize genetic differences in order to mate, but the different colonies within the super colony avoid aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Florian M.|last2=Schlick-Steiner|first2=Birgit C.|last3=Moder|first3=Karl|last4=Stauffer|first4=Christian|last5=Arthofer|first5=Wolfgang|last6=Buschinger|first6=Alfred|last7=Espadaler|first7=Xavier|last8=Christian|first8=Erhard|last9=Einfinger|first9=Katrin|title=Abandoning Aggression but Maintaining Self-Nonself Discrimination as a First Stage in Ant Supercolony Formation|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982207020684|journal=Current Biology|volume=17|issue=21|pages=1903–1907|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.09.061|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2000, the largest known ant supercolony was on the [[Ishikari subprefecture|Ishikari]] coast of [[Hokkaidō]], Japan. The colony was estimated to contain 306 million worker ants and one million queen ants living in 45,000 nests interconnected by underground passages over an area of {{convert|2.7|km²|acre|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Higashi, S. and K. Yamauchi. "Influence of a Supercolonial Ant Formica (Formica) yessensis Forel on the Distribution of Other Ants in Ishikari Coast". ''Japanese Journal of Ecology'', No. 29, 257–64, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, an enormous supercolony of [[Argentine ant]]s was found in [[Southern Europe]] (report published in 2002). Of 33 ant populations tested along the {{convert|6004|km|mi|adj=on}} stretch along the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts in Southern Europe, 30 belonged to one supercolony with estimated millions of nests and billions of workers, interspersed with three populations of another supercolony.&lt;ref name=gpk&gt;Tatiana Giraud, Jes S. Pedersen, and Laurent Kelle. ''[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=122904 Evolution of supercolonies: The Argentine ants of southern Europe]''. The National Academy of Sciences, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers claim that this case of unicoloniality cannot be explained by loss of their genetic diversity due to the [[genetic bottleneck]] of the imported ants.&lt;ref name="gpk" /&gt; In 2009, it was demonstrated that the largest Japanese, Californian and European [[Argentine ant]] supercolonies were in fact part of a single global "megacolony".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8127000/8127519.stm '''Ant mega-colony takes over world''' BBC Wednesday, 1 July 2009 10:41 GMT]''.&lt;/ref&gt; This intercontinental megacolony represents the most populous recorded animal society on earth.

Another supercolony, measuring approximately {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide, was found beneath [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]], [[Australia]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3561352.stm Super ant colony hits Australia]''. BBC News, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizational terminology ==
The following terminology is commonly used among [[myrmecologists]] to describe the behaviors demonstrated by ants when founding and organizing colonies:&lt;ref name="TheAnts"/&gt;{{rp|p. 209}}

;Monogyny: Establishment of an ant colony under a single egg-laying queen.
;Polygyny: Establishment of an ant colony under multiple egg-laying queens.
;Oligogyny: Establishment of a polygynous colony where the multiple egg-laying queens remain far apart from one another in the nest.
;Haplometrosis: Establishment of a colony by a single queen.
;Pleometrosis: Establishment of a colony by multiple queens.
;Monodomy: Establishment of a colony at a single nest site.
;Polydomy: Establishment of a colony across multiple nest sites.

==Colony structure==
Ant colonies have a complex hierarchical social structure. Ants jobs are determined and can be changed by age. As ants grow older their jobs move them further from the queen, or center of the colony. Younger ants work within the nest protecting the queen and young. Sometimes, a queen is not present and is replaced by egg-laying workers. These worker ants can only lay haploid eggs producing sterile offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=PEETERS|first=CHRISTIAN|date=1991-10-01|title=The occurrence of sexual reproduction among ant workers|url=https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/44/2/141/2654338/The-occurrence-of-sexual-reproduction-among-ant|journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|language=en|volume=44|issue=2|pages=141–152|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1991.tb00612.x|issn=0024-4066}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the title of queen, she doesn't delegate the tasks to the worker ants; however, the ants choose their tasks based on personal preference.&lt;ref name="asu.edu"/&gt;
Ants as a colony also work as a collective "super mind". Ants can compare areas and solve complex problems by using information gained by each member of the colony to find the best nesting site or to find food.&lt;ref name="asu.edu" /&gt; Some social-parasitic species of ants, known as the [[Slave-making ant]], raid and steal [[larva]]e from neighboring colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foitzik|first=S.|last2=DeHeer|first2=C. J.|last3=Hunjan|first3=D. N.|last4=Herbers|first4=J. M.|date=2001-06-07|title=Coevolution in host-parasite systems: behavioural strategies of slave-making ants and their hosts.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=268|issue=1472|pages=1139–1146|doi=10.1098/rspb.2001.1627|issn=0962-8452|pmc=1088719|pmid=11375101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Excavation ==
[[Ant hill art]] is a growing collecting hobby. It involves pouring molten metal (typically non-toxic zinc or aluminum), plaster or cement down an ant colony mound acting as a mold and upon hardening, one excavates the resulting structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Xvsxarw-J0|title=Largest Aluminum Fire Ant Colony Cast So Far (Cast #072)|first=|last=Anthill Art|date=12 March 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, this involves a great deal of digging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFg21x2sj-M|title=Giant Ant Hill Excavated|first=|last=KYLYKaHYT|date=24 December 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The casts are often used for research and education purposes but many are simply given or sold to natural history museums or sold as folk art or as souvenirs. Usually, the hills are chosen after the ants have abandoned as to not kill any ants; however in the Southeast United States, pouring into an active colony of [[Invasive species|invasive]] [[fire ant]]s is a novel way to eliminate them.

== Ant-hills ==
{{See also|Termite mound}}
[[File:Ants mount making.ogg|thumb|Nest construction of ants]]
An ''ant-hill'', in its simplest form, is a pile of [[earth]], [[sand]], [[pine]] needles, or [[clay]] or a composite of these and other materials that build up at the entrances of the subterranean dwellings of ant colonies as they are excavated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCook|first=Henry C.|date=1877|title=Mound-Making Ants of the Alleghenies, Their Architecture and Habits|journal=Transactions of the American Entomological Society|volume=6|pages=253–296|doi=10.2307/25076323|jstor=25076323}}&lt;/ref&gt; A colony is built and maintained by legions of worker [[ant]]s, who carry tiny bits of dirt and pebbles in their [[mandible (insect)|mandible]]s and deposit them near the exit of the colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Deborah M.|date=January–February 1995|title=The Development of Organization in an Ant Colony|journal=American Scientist|volume= 83|issue= 1|pages=50–57|jstor=29775362|bibcode=1995AmSci..83...50G}}&lt;/ref&gt; They normally deposit the dirt or vegetation at the top of the hill to prevent it from sliding back into the colony, but in some species, they actively sculpt the materials into specific shapes and may create nest chambers within the mound.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

'''Ataxia''' is a [[neurological sign]] consisting of lack of voluntary [[Motor coordination|coordination of muscle movements]] that can include [[gait abnormality]], speech changes and abnormalities in eye movements. Ataxia is a clinical manifestation indicating dysfunction of the parts of the [[nervous system]] that coordinate movement, such as the [[cerebellum]]. Ataxia can be limited to one side of the body, which is referred to as hemiataxia. Several possible causes exist for these patterns of neurological dysfunction. Dystaxia is a mild degree of ataxia. [[Friedreich's ataxia]] has gait abnormality as the most commonly presented symptom.&lt;ref&gt;dystaxia. (n.d.). The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved 09 March 2014, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dystaxia&lt;/ref&gt; The word is from [[Greek (language)|Greek]] ''α-'' [a negative prefix] + ''-τάξις'' [order] = "lack of order".

== Types ==

=== Cerebellar ===
{{Main|Cerebellar ataxia}}
The term [[cerebellar ataxia]] is used to indicate ataxia that is due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. The cerebellum is responsible for integrating a significant amount of neural information that is used to coordinate smoothly ongoing movements and to participate in [[motor planning]]. Although ataxia is not present with all cerebellar [[lesion]]s, many conditions affecting the [[cerebellum]] do produce ataxia.&lt;ref name="Schmahmann"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmahmann JD | title = Disorders of the cerebellum: ataxia, dysmetria of thought, and the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome | journal = J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 367–78 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15377747 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.16.3.367 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  People with cerebellar ataxia may have trouble regulating the force, range, direction, velocity and rhythm of muscle contractions.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8036-0093-3"&gt;{{cite book | author = Fredericks CM | chapter = Disorders of the Cerebellum and Its Connections | veditors = Saladin LK, Fredericks CM | title = Pathophysiology of the motor systems: principles and clinical presentations | publisher = F.A.

People with cerebellar ataxia may initially present with poor balance, which could be demonstrated as an inability to stand on one leg or perform [[tandem gait]]. As the condition progresses, walking is characterized by a widened base and high stepping, as well as staggering and lurching from side to side.&lt;ref name ="Schmahmann" /&gt; Turning is also problematic and could result in falls. As cerebellar ataxia becomes severe, great assistance and effort are needed to stand and walk.&lt;ref name ="Schmahmann" /&gt; [[Dysarthria]], an impairment with articulation, may also be present and is characterized by "scanning" speech that consists of slower rate, irregular rhythm and variable volume.&lt;ref name ="Schmahmann" /&gt; There may also be slurring of speech, tremor of the voice and [[ataxic respiration]]. Cerebellar ataxia could result with incoordination of movement, particularly in the extremities. There is overshooting (or hypermetria) with finger to nose testing, and heel to shin testing; thus, [[dysmetria]] is evident.&lt;ref name ="Schmahmann" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manto M, Godaux E, Jacquy J | title = Cerebellar hypermetria is larger when the inertial load is artificially increased | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–52 | date = January 1994 | pmid = 8285591 | doi = 10.1002/ana.410350108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Impairments with alternating movements ([[dysdiadochokinesia]]), as well as [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]], may also be displayed. There may also be tremor of the head and trunk ([[titubation]]) in individuals with cerebellar ataxia.&lt;ref name ="Schmahmann" /&gt;

It is thought that [[dysmetria]] is caused by a deficit in the control of interaction [[torque]]s in multijoint motion.&lt;ref name="pmid10805697"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bastian AJ, Zackowski KM, Thach WT | title = Cerebellar ataxia: torque deficiency or torque mismatch between joints? | journal = J. Neurophysiol. | volume = 83 | issue = 5 | pages = 3019–30 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10805697 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interaction torques are created at an associated joint when the primary joint is moved. For example, if a movement required reaching to touch a target in front of the body, [[flexion]] at the [[shoulder]] would create a torque at the [[elbow]], while [[extension (kinesiology)|extension]] of the elbow would create a torque at the [[wrist]]. These torques increase as the speed of movement increases and must be compensated and adjusted for to create coordinated movement. This may, therefore, explain decreased coordination at higher movement [[velocity|velocities]] and [[acceleration]]s.

* '''[[Vestibulocerebellar syndrome|Dysfunction of the vestibulocerebellum]]''' ([[flocculonodular lobe]]) impairs the balance and the control of eye movements. This presents itself with [[postural instability]], in which the person tends to separate his/her feet upon standing, to gain a wider base and to avoid [[titubation]] (bodily oscillations tending to be forward-backward ones). The instability is therefore worsened when standing with the feet together, regardless of whether the eyes are open or closed. This is a negative [[Romberg's test]], or more accurately, it denotes the individual's inability to carry out the test, because the individual feels unstable even with open eyes. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* '''Dysfunction of the [[Anatomy of the cerebellum#Phylogenetic and functional divisions|spinocerebellum]]'''  ([[vermis]] and associated areas near the midline) presents itself with a wide-based "drunken sailor" [[gait]] (called truncal ataxia),&lt;ref name="Blumenfeld"&gt;{{cite book | author = Blumenfeld H | title = Neuroanatomy through clinical cases | publisher = Sinauer | location = Sunderland, Mass | year = 2002 | pages = 670–671 | isbn = 0-87893-060-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; characterised by uncertain starts and stops, lateral deviations, and unequal steps. As a result of this gait impairment, [[falling (accident)|falling]] is a concern in patients with ataxia. Studies examining falls in this population show that 74–93% of patients have fallen at least once in the past year and up to 60% admit to fear of falling.&lt;ref name="pmid20157791"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fonteyn EM, Schmitz-Hübsch T, Verstappen CC, Baliko L, Bloem BR, Boesch S, Bunn L, Charles P, Dürr A, Filla A, Giunti P, Globas C, Klockgether T, Melegh B, Pandolfo M, De Rosa A, Schöls L, Timmann D, Munneke M, Kremer BP, van de Warrenburg BP | title = Falls in spinocerebellar ataxias: Results of the EuroSCA Fall Study | journal = Cerebellum | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 232–9 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20157791 | doi = 10.1007/s12311-010-0155-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15645525"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van de Warrenburg BP, Steijns JA, Munneke M, Kremer BP, Bloem BR | title = Falls in degenerative cerebellar ataxias | journal = Mov.

* '''Dysfunction of the [[Anatomy of the cerebellum#Phylogenetic and functional divisions|cerebrocerebellum]]''' (lateral hemispheres) presents as disturbances in carrying out voluntary, planned movements by the extremities (called appendicular ataxia).&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld/&gt; These include:
**[[intention tremor]] (coarse trembling, accentuated over the execution of voluntary movements, possibly involving the head and eyes as well as the limbs and torso);
**peculiar writing abnormalities (large, unequal letters, irregular underlining);
**a peculiar pattern of [[dysarthria]] (slurred speech, sometimes characterised by explosive variations in voice intensity despite a regular rhythm).
**inability to perform rapidly alternating movements, known as [[dysdiadochokinesia]]. This could involve rapidly switching from [[pronation]] to [[supination]] of the forearm. Movements become more irregular with increases of speed.&lt;ref name=Schmitz&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Examination of Coordination |vauthors=Schmitz TJ, O'Sullivan SB | title = Physical rehabilitation | publisher = F.A. Davis | location = Philadelphia | year = 2007 | pages = 193–225 | isbn = 0-8036-1247-8  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**inability to judge distances or ranges of movement. This is known as [[dysmetria]] and is often seen as undershooting, [[hypometria]], or overshooting, [[hypermetria]], the required distance or range to reach a target. This is sometimes seen when a patient is asked to reach out and touch someone's finger or touch his or her own nose.&lt;ref name=Schmitz /&gt;
**the rebound phenomenon, also known as the loss of the check reflex is also sometimes seen in patients with cerebellar ataxia. For example, when a patient is flexing his or her elbow isometrically against a resistance. When the resistance is suddenly removed without warning, the patient's arm may swing up and even strike themselves. With an intact check reflex, the patient will check and activate the opposing triceps to slow and stop the movement.&lt;ref name=Schmitz /&gt;
**patients may exhibit a constellation of subtle to overt cognitive symptoms. These symptoms are gathered under the terminology of Schmahmann's syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manto M, Mariën P | title = Schmahmann's syndrome - identification of the third cornerstone of clinical ataxiology | journal = Cerebellum &amp; Ataxias | volume = 2 | pages = 2 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26331045 | pmc = 4552302 | doi = 10.1186/s40673-015-0023-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sensory ===
The term [[sensory ataxia]] is employed to indicate ataxia due to loss of [[proprioception]], the loss of sensitivity to the positions of joint and body parts. This is generally caused by dysfunction of the [[dorsal columns]] of the spinal cord, because they carry proprioceptive information up to the brain. In some cases, the cause of sensory ataxia may instead be dysfunction of the various parts of the brain which receive positional information, including the cerebellum, [[thalamus]], and [[parietal lobe]]s.

Sensory ataxia presents itself with an unsteady "stomping" gait with heavy [[heel]] strikes, as well as a postural instability that is usually worsened when the lack of proprioceptive input cannot be compensated for by [[visual perception|visual input]], such as in poorly lit environments.

[[Physician]]s can find evidence of sensory ataxia during [[physical examination]] by having the patient stand with his/her feet together and [[Human eye|eye]]s shut. In affected patients, this will cause the instability to worsen markedly, producing wide oscillations and possibly a fall. This is called a positive [[Romberg's test]]. Worsening of the finger-pointing test with the eyes closed is another feature of sensory ataxia. Also, when the patient is standing with arms and hands extended toward the physician, if the eyes are closed, the patient's finger will tend to "fall down" and then be restored to the horizontal extended position by sudden muscular contractions (the "ataxic hand").

=== Vestibular ===
The term ''vestibular ataxia'' is employed to indicate ataxia due to dysfunction of the [[vestibular system]], which in acute and unilateral cases is associated with prominent [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]]. In slow-onset, chronic bilateral cases of vestibular dysfunction, these characteristic manifestations may be absent, and [[dysequilibrium]] may be the sole presentation.

== Causes ==
The three types of ataxia have overlapping causes, and therefore can either coexist or occur in isolation. Cerebellar ataxia can have many causes despite normal neuroimaging.

=== Focal lesions ===
Any type of focal lesion of the [[central nervous system]] (such as [[stroke]], [[brain tumor]], [[multiple sclerosis]]) will cause the type of ataxia corresponding to the site of the lesion: cerebellar if in the cerebellum, sensory if in the dorsal spinal cord (and rarely in the [[thalamus]] or [[parietal lobe]]), vestibular if in the vestibular system (including the vestibular areas of the [[cerebral cortex]]).

=== Exogenous substances (metabolic ataxia) ===
Exogenous substances that cause ataxia mainly do so because they have a depressant effect on central nervous system function. The most common example is [[ethanol]] (alcohol), which is capable of causing reversible cerebellar and vestibular ataxia. Other examples include various prescription drugs (e.g. most [[antiepileptic drugs]] have cerebellar ataxia as a possible [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effect]]), Lithium level over 1.5mEq/L, [[synthetic cannabinoid]] [[Dexanabinol|HU-211]] ingestion&lt;ref name="Inadvertent Ingestion of Marijuana --- Los Angeles, California, 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5834a2.htm?s_cid=mm5834a2 |title=Inadvertent Ingestion of Marijuana --- Los Angeles, California, 2009 |accessdate=3 September 2009 |format= |work= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511211253/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5834a2.htm?s_cid=mm5834a2 |archivedate=11 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and various other recreational drugs (e.g. [[ketamine]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] or [[dextromethorphan]], all of which are [[NMDA receptor antagonist]]s that produce a dissociative state at high doses). A further class of pharmaceuticals which can cause short term ataxia, especially in high doses are the [[benzodiazepine]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid817697"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Browne TR | title = Clonazepam.

=== Radiation poisoning ===
Ataxia can be induced as a result of severe [[Acute radiation syndrome|acute radiation poisoning]] with an absorbed dose of more than 30 [[Gray (unit)|Grays]].

=== Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency ===
[[Vitamin B12 deficiency|Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency]] may cause, among several neurological abnormalities, overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia.

=== Hypothyroidism ===
Symptoms of neurological dysfunction may be the presenting feature in some patients with [[hypothyroidism]]. These include reversible [[cerebellar ataxia]], [[dementia]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], [[psychosis]] and [[coma]].

=== Hereditary ataxias ===
Ataxia may depend on [[hereditary]] disorders consisting of degeneration of the cerebellum and/or of the spine; most cases feature both to some extent, and therefore present with overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia, even though one is often more evident than the other. Hereditary disorders causing ataxia include [[autosomal dominant]] ones such as [[spinocerebellar ataxia]], [[episodic ataxia]], and [[dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy]], as well as [[autosomal recessive]] disorders such as [[Friedreich's ataxia]] (sensory and cerebellar, with the former predominating) and [[Niemann Pick disease]], [[ataxia-telangiectasia]] (sensory and cerebellar, with the latter predominating), and [[abetalipoproteinaemia]]. An example of X-linked ataxic condition is the rare [[fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome]] or FXTAS.

=== Arnold-Chiari malformation (congenital ataxia) ===
[[Arnold-Chiari malformation]] is a malformation of the [[Human brain|brain]]. It consists of a downward displacement of the [[cerebellar tonsils]] and the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]] through the [[foramen magnum]], sometimes causing [[hydrocephalus]] as a result of obstruction of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] outflow.

=== Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency ===
[[Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency]] is an [[autosomal]]-[[recessive gene]] disorder where mutations in the ALDH5A1 gene results in the accumulation of [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid]] (GHB) in the body. GHB accumulates in the nervous system and can cause ataxia as well as other [[neurological]] dysfunction.&lt;ref name="urlSSADH "&gt;{{cite journal | title = Disorders of GABA metabolism | last= Pearl | first=P.  | pmc=4256671 | pmid=25485164 | doi=10.3233/PEP-14097 | volume=3 | year=2014 | pages=217–227 | journal=Journal of Pediatric Epilepsy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{chem|Na|+}}-{{chem|K|+}} pump has been shown to control and set the intrinsic activity mode of [[cerebellar]] [[Purkinje neurons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Forrest MD, Wall MJ, Press DA, Feng J | title = The Sodium-Potassium Pump Controls the Intrinsic Firing of the Cerebellar Purkinje Neuron | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 12 | pages = e51169 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23284664 | pmc = 3527461 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0051169 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the pump might not simply be a homeostatic, "housekeeping" molecule for ionic gradients; but could be a computational element in the [[cerebellum]] and the [[brain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Forrest MD |title=The sodium-potassium pump is an information processing element in brain computation |journal=Frontiers in Physiology |volume=5 |issue=472 |date=December 2014 |doi=10.3389/fphys.2014.00472 |doi-access=free|pmc=4274886 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119063855/http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fphys.2014.00472/full |archivedate=19 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, an [[ouabain]] block of {{chem|Na|+}}-{{chem|K|+}} pumps in the cerebellum of a live [[mouse]] results in it displaying ataxia and [[dystonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Calderon DP, Fremont R, Kraenzlin F, Khodakhah K | title = The neural substrates of rapid-onset Dystonia-Parkinsonism | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 357–65 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21297628 | pmc = 3430603 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2753 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ataxia is observed for lower ouabain concentrations, dystonia is observed at higher ouabain concentrations.

=== Cerebellar ataxia associated with anti-GAD antibodies ===
Antibodies against the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD: enzyme changing glutamate into GABA) cause cerebellar deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mitoma H, Manto M, Hampe CS | title = Pathogenic Roles of Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase 65 Autoantibodies in Cerebellar Ataxias | journal = Journal of Immunology Research | volume = 2017 | pages = 2913297 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28386570 | pmc = 5366212 | doi = 10.1155/2017/2913297 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The antibodies impair motor learning and cause behavioral deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manto M, Honnorat J, Hampe CS, Guerra-Narbona R, López-Ramos JC, Delgado-García JM, Saitow F, Suzuki H, Yanagawa Y, Mizusawa H, Mitoma H | title = Disease-specific monoclonal antibodies targeting glutamate decarboxylase impair GABAergic neurotransmission and affect motor learning and behavioral functions | journal = Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 9 | pages = 78 | date = 2015 | pmid = 25870548 | pmc = 4375997 | doi = 10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00078 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
The treatment of ataxia and its effectiveness depend on the underlying cause. Treatment may limit or reduce the effects of ataxia, but it is unlikely to eliminate them entirely. Recovery tends to be better in individuals with a single focal injury (such as [[stroke]] or a [[benign tumour]]), compared to those who have a neurological degenerative condition.&lt;ref name="can rehabilitation help"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morton SM, Bastian AJ | title = Can rehabilitation help ataxia? | journal = Neurology | volume = 73 | issue = 22 | pages = 1818–9 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19864635 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181c33b21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the management of degenerative ataxia was published in 2009.&lt;ref name="systematic review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trujillo-Martín MM, Serrano-Aguilar P, Monton-Alvarez F, Carrillo-Fumero R | title = Effectiveness and safety of treatments for degenerative ataxias: a systematic review | journal = Mov.

Diseases include vitamin E deficiency, abetalipoproteinemia, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, Niemann–Pick type C disease, Refsum's disease, glucose transporter type 1 deficiency, episodic ataxia type 2, gluten ataxia, glutamic acid decarboxylase ataxia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramirez-Zamora A, Zeigler W, Desai N, Biller J|title=Treatable causes of cerebellar ataxia | journal = Movement Disorders | date = Mar 2015 | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | doi = 10.1002/mds.26158 | pages=614–623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement disorders associated with ataxia can be managed by pharmacological treatments and through [[physical therapy]] and [[occupational therapy]] to reduce [[disability]].&lt;ref name="pmid17000340"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perlman SL | title = Ataxias | journal = Clin. Geriatr. Med. | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 859–77, vii | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17000340 | doi = 10.1016/j.cger.2006.06.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some drug treatments that have been used to control ataxia include: [[5-hydroxytryptophan]] (5-HTP), [[idebenone]], [[amantadine]], [[physostigmine]], [[L-carnitine]] or derivatives, [[trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]], [[vigabatrin]], [[phosphatidylcholine]], [[acetazolamide]], [[4-aminopyridine]], [[buspirone]], and a combination of [[coenzyme Q10]] and [[vitamin E]].&lt;ref name="systematic review"/&gt;

[[Physical therapy]] requires a focus on adapting activity and facilitating [[motor learning]] for retraining specific functional motor patterns.&lt;ref name="Intensive coordinative training improves motor performance in degenerative cerebellar disease"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ilg W, Synofzik M, Brötz D, Burkard S, Giese MA, Schöls L | title = Intensive coordinative training improves motor performance in degenerative cerebellar disease | journal = Neurology | volume = 73 | issue = 22 | pages = 1823–30 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19864636 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181c33adf }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent systematic review suggested that physical therapy is effective, but there is only moderate evidence to support this conclusion.&lt;ref name="pmid19114434"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin CL, Tan D, Bragge P, Bialocerkowski A | title = Effectiveness of physiotherapy for adults with cerebellar dysfunction: a systematic review | journal = Clinical Rehabilitation | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–26 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19114434 | doi = 10.1177/0269215508097853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly used physical therapy interventions for cerebellar ataxia are vestibular habituation, [[Frenkel exercises]], [[proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation]] (PNF), and balance training; however, therapy is often highly individualized and gait and coordination training are large components of therapy.

Current research suggests that, if a person is able to walk with or without a [[mobility aid]], physical therapy should include an exercise program addressing five components: static balance, dynamic balance, trunk-limb coordination, stairs, and [[contracture]] prevention. Once the physical therapist determines that the individual is able to safely perform parts of the program independently, it is important that the individual be prescribed and regularly engage in a supplementary home exercise program that incorporates these components to further improve long term outcomes. These outcomes include balance tasks, gait, and individual activities of daily living. While the improvements are attributed primarily to changes in the brain and not just the hip and/or ankle joints, it is still unknown whether the improvements are due to adaptations in the cerebellum or compensation by other areas of the brain.&lt;ref name="Intensive coordinative training improves motor performance in degenerative cerebellar disease"/&gt;

Decomposition, simplification, or slowing of multijoint movement may also be an effective strategy that therapists may use to improve function in patients with ataxia.&lt;ref name="pmid9184691"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bastian AJ | title = Mechanisms of ataxia | journal = Physical Therapy | volume = 77 | issue = 6 | pages = 672–5 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9184691 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Training likely needs to be intense and focused—as indicated by one study performed with stroke patients experiencing limb ataxia who underwent intensive upper limb retraining.&lt;ref name="stroke ataxia"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richards L, Senesac C, McGuirk T, Woodbury M, Howland D, Davis S, Patterson T | title = Response to intensive upper extremity therapy by individuals with ataxia from stroke | journal = Top Stroke Rehabil | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 262–71 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18647730 | doi = 10.1310/tsr1503-262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their therapy consisted of [[constraint-induced movement therapy]] which resulted in improvements of their arm function.&lt;ref name="stroke ataxia" /&gt; Treatment should likely include strategies to manage difficulties with everyday activities such as walking. Gait aids (such as a cane or walker) can be provided to decrease the risk of falls associated with impairment of [[Balance (ability)|balance]] or poor [[Motor coordination|coordination]]. Severe ataxia may eventually lead to the need for a [[wheelchair]]. To obtain better results, possible coexisting motor deficits need to be addressed in addition to those induced by ataxia. For example, muscle weakness and decreased endurance could lead to increasing fatigue and poorer movement patterns.

There are several assessment tools available to therapists and health care professionals working with patients with ataxia. The [[International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale]] (ICARS) is one of the most widely used and has been proven to have very high reliability and validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmitz-Hübsch T, Tezenas du Montcel S, Baliko L, Boesch S, Bonato S, Fancellu R, Giunti P, Globas C, Kang JS, Kremer B, Mariotti C, Melegh B, Rakowicz M, Rola R, Romano S, Schöls L, Szymanski S, van de Warrenburg BP, Zdzienicka E, Dürr A, Klockgether T | title = Reliability and validity of the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale: a study in 156 spinocerebellar ataxia patients | journal = Mov.

These tests include, but are not limited to:

* The [[Berg Balance Scale]]
* Tandem Walking (to test for [[Tandem gait]]ability)
* Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) &lt;ref name="pmid16769946"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmitz-Hübsch T, du Montcel ST, Baliko L, Berciano J, Boesch S, Depondt C, Giunti P, Globas C, Infante J, Kang JS, Kremer B, Mariotti C, Melegh B, Pandolfo M, Rakowicz M, Ribai P, Rola R, Schöls L, Szymanski S, van de Warrenburg BP, Dürr A, Klockgether T, Fancellu R | title = Scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia: development of a new clinical scale | journal = Neurology | volume = 66 | issue = 11 | pages = 1717–20 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16769946 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000219042.60538.92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other uses ==
The term "ataxia" is sometimes used in a broader sense to indicate lack of coordination in some physiological process. Examples include '''optic ataxia''' (lack of coordination between visual inputs and hand movements, resulting in inability to reach and grab objects) and '''ataxic respiration''' (lack of coordination in respiratory movements, usually due to dysfunction of the respiratory centres in the [[medulla oblongata]]). Optic ataxia may be caused by lesions to the posterior parietal cortex, which is responsible for combining and expressing positional information and relating it to movement. Outputs of the posterior parietal cortex include the spinal cord, brain stem motor pathways, pre-motor and pre-frontal cortex, basal ganglia and the cerebellum. Some neurons in the posterior parietal cortex are modulated by intention. Optic ataxia is usually part of [[Balint's syndrome]], but can be seen in isolation with injuries to the superior parietal lobule, as it represents a disconnection between visual-association cortex and the frontal premotor and motor cortex.&lt;ref name="pmid17603404"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vallar G | title = Spatial neglect, Balint-Homes' and Gerstmann's syndrome, and other spatial disorders | journal = CNS Spectr | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 527–36 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17603404 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 April 2014 amid the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état]], An [[Egypt]]ian judge has sentenced 683 alleged [[Muslim Brotherhood]] supporters to death, including the group's supreme guide, [[Mohamed Badie]], and confirmed the death sentences of 37 of 529 alleged supporters previously condemned. Mohamed Elmessiry, an [[Amnesty International]] researcher monitoring the cases, said they "lacked basic fair trial guarantees". The defendants from the first case whose death sentences were not upheld were each sentenced to 25 years in prison.&lt;ref name="aljazeera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/04/egyptian-court-sentences-683-people-death-201442875510336199.html|title=Egyptian court sentences 683 people to death|author=Al Jazeera|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian law requires that death sentences are confirmed by the presiding judge after a comment has been invited from the [[Shawki Ibrahim Abdel-Karim Allam|Grand Mufti of Al Azhar]], the country's leading religious official. The Mufti's opinion to the judge is secret. The guilty verdict and death sentences are still subject to appeal at the Court of Appeal. "The case killed the credibility of the Egyptian judicial system," said Elmessiry of [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref name="aljazeera"/&gt;

The violence of which the defendants are accused took place on August 14, 2013 as news reached [[Minya Governorate|Minya]] governorate that police had launched the deadly clearance of [[August 2013 Rabaa Massacre|two sit-ins in Cairo]], held by supporters of former President [[Mohamed Morsi]], who had been deposed after mass protests against his rule.&lt;ref name="aljazeera"/&gt;

'''''Christian Morals'''''  is a prose work written by the physician [[Sir Thomas Browne]] as advice for his eldest children. It was published posthumously in 1716 and consists, as its title implies, of meditations upon [[Christian]] values and conduct. 

The work is divided into three sections with many of the numbered  paragraphs standing-alone as text, with unique and startling imagery involving optics, perspective and appearance. A work of a lifetime's study and understanding of the human condition, in psychological terms, Browne's last major work may be considered as advice on obtaining individuation and self-realization as much as Christian virtue.

Stylistically, it displays some of the best and worst excesses of Browne's at times labyrinthine and meandering baroque style, often involving [[Parallelism (grammar)|parallelism]]s in its sentence construction.  

''Christian Morals'' was edited by [[Samuel Johnson]] in 1756; Johnson prefaced his edition with a biography of Browne. His latter prose imitated aspects of Browne's late prose-style.

'''''Chroococcidiopsis''''' is one of the most primitive [[cyanobacteria]] known. It is a [[photosynthetic]], coccoidal [[bacterium]] and while a diversity of species and cultures exist within the genus,&lt;ref&gt;Cumbers, J. &amp; Rothschild, L.J., 2014. Salt Tolerance and Polyphyly in the Cyanobacterium ''Chroococcidiopsis''  (Pleurocapsales). J. Phycol. '''50''': 472–482&lt;/ref&gt; with a diversity of phenotypes, some members of the genus are known for their ability to survive harsh environmental conditions, including both high and low temperatures, [[ionizing radiation]], and high salinity. Organisms capable of living in such harsh conditions are referred to as [[extremophiles]].

==Desiccation resistance==
The ability of ''Chroococcidiopsis'' to resist [[desiccation]] in arid environments is due in part because it colonizes the underside of translucent rocks. The underside of these rocks provides enough condensed moisture for growth while the rock's translucent nature allows just enough light to reach the organism for photosynthesis to occur.

==Mars colonization==
Due to its resistance to harsh environmental conditions, especially low temperature, low moisture, and radiation tolerance, ''Chroococcidiopsis'' has been thought of as an organism capable of living on Mars. Scientists have speculated about the possibly of introducing ''Chroococcidiopsis'' to the Martian environment to aid in the formation of an aerobic environment. In addition to oxygen production, ''Chroococcidiopsis'' could aid in the formation of soil on the Martian surface. On Earth, soil is formed from the decomposition of organic matter. On Mars, because no organic matter is present, the organic material from the microbes themselves would provide the necessary organic matter. The soil and oxygen produced by these organisms could one day provide the conditions necessary for humans to grow food on Mars, possibly allowing for permanent human civilizations on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greening of the Red Planet|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast26jan_1/|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=2011-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Billi|first=Daniela |author2=Friedmann, Hoffer |author3=Caiola, Ocampo-Friedmann|title=Ionizing-radiation resistance in the desiccation-tolerant cyanobacterium ''Chroococcidiopsis'' |journal=[[Applied and Environmental Microbiology]] |date=April 2000 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=1489–1492 |url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/full/66/4/1489 |doi=10.1128/aem.66.4.1489-1492.2000|pmc=92012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On a shorter time scale, cyanobacteria such as ''Chroococcidiopsis'' could be used in closed systems to produce resources for manned outposts on Mars without altering the planet's surface or atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sustainable life support on Mars – the potential roles of cyanobacteria|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S147355041500021X|journal = International Journal of Astrobiology|date = 2015-08-01|issn = 1475-3006|pages = 1–28|volume = FirstView|doi = 10.1017/S147355041500021X|first = Cyprien|last = Verseux|first2 = Mickael|last2 = Baqué|first3 = Kirsi|last3 = Lehto|first4 = Jean-Pierre P.|last4 = de Vera|first5 = Lynn J.|last5 = Rothschild|first6 = Daniela|last6 = Billi|bibcode = 2016IJAsB..15...65V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20897">'''Commonsense reasoning''' is one of the branches of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) that is concerned with simulating the human ability to make presumptions about the type and essence of ordinary situations they encounter every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=|author1=Ernest Davis|author2=Gary Marcus|date=2015|title=Commonsense reasoning|url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191169-commonsense-reasoning-and-commonsense-knowledge-in-artificial-intelligence/fulltext|magazine=Communications of the ACM|publisher=|volume=58|pages=92–103|doi=10.1145/2701413|accessdate=|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These assumptions include judgments about the physical properties, purpose, intentions and behavior of people and objects, as well as possible outcomes of their actions and interactions. A device that exhibits commonsense reasoning will be capable of predicting results and drawing conclusions that are similar to humans' [[folk psychology]] (humans' innate ability to reason about people's behavior and intentions) and [[naive physics]] (humans' natural understanding of the physical world).

== Commonsense knowledge ==
In Artificial intelligence, [[Commonsense knowledge (artificial intelligence)|commonsense knowledge]] is the set of background information that an individual is intended to know or assume and the ability to use it when appropriate. It is a shared knowledge (between everybody or people in a particular culture or age group only). The way to obtain commonsense is by learning it or experiencing it. In communication, it is what people don’t have to say because the interlocutor is expected to know or make a presumption about.

=== Commonsense knowledge problem ===
The commonsense knowledge problem is a current project in the sphere of artificial intelligence to create a database that contains the general knowledge most individuals are expected to have, represented in an accessible way to artificial intelligence programs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.journals.elsevier.com/artificial-intelligence/|title = Artificial intelligence Programs|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; that use natural language. Due to the broad scope of the commonsense knowledge this issue is considered to be among the most difficult ones in the AI research&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271|title = Artificial intelligence applications|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; sphere. In order for any task to be done as a human mind would manage it, the machine is required to appear as intelligent as a human being. Such tasks include object recognition, machine translation and text mining. To perform them, the machine has to be aware of the same concepts that an individual, who possess commonsense knowledge, recognizes.

== Commonsense in intelligent tasks ==
In 1961, [[Yehoshua Bar-Hillel|Bar Hille]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l first discussed the need and significance of practical knowledge for natural language processing in the context of machine translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai|title = Bar Hillel Artificial Intelligence Research Machine Translation|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ambiguities are resolved by using simple and easy to acquire rules. Others require a broad acknowledgement of the surrounding world, thus they require more commonsense knowledge. For instance when a machine is used to translate a text, problems of ambiguity arise, which could be easily resolved by attaining a concrete and true understanding of the context. Online translators often resolve ambiguities using analogous or similar words. For example, in translating the sentences "The electrician is working" and "The telephone is working" into German, the machine translates correctly "working" in the means of "laboring" in the first one and as "functioning properly" in the second one. The machine has seen and read in the body of texts that the German words for "laboring" and "electrician" are frequently used in a combination and are found close together. The same applies for "telephone" and "function properly". However, the statistical proxy which works in simple cases often fails in complex ones. Existing computer programs carry out simple language tasks by manipulating short phrases or separate words, but they don’t attempt any deeper understanding and focus on short-term results.

=== Computer vision ===
[[File:Thyme-Bathroom-RGB.jpg|alt=Figure 1|thumb|Issues in computer vision&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RANGES - The Bathroom Studio|url = http://www.thebathroomstudio.net/ranges/|website = www.thebathroomstudio.net|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
]]
Issues of this kind arise in computer vision. For instance when looking at the photograph of the bathroom (figure 1) some of the items that are small and only partly seen, such as the towels or the body lotions, are recognizable due to the surrounding objects (toilet, wash basin, bathtub), which suggest the purpose of the room. In an isolated image they would be difficult to identify. Movies prove to be even more difficult tasks. Some movies contain scenes and moments that cannot be understood by simply matching memorized templates to images. For instance, to understand the context of the movie, the viewer is required to make inferences about characters’ intentions and make presumptions depending on their behavior. In the contemporary state of the art, it is impossible to build and manage a program that will perform such tasks as reasoning, i.e. predicting characters’ actions. The most that can be done is to identify basic actions and track characters.

=== Robotic manipulation ===
The need and importance of commonsense reasoning in [[autonomous robot]]s that work in a real-life uncontrolled environment is evident. For instance, if a robot is programmed to perform the tasks of a waiter on a cocktail party, and it sees that the glass he had picked up is broken, the waiter-robot should not pour liquid into the glass, but instead pick up another one. Such tasks seem obvious when an individual possess simple commonsense reasoning, but to ensure that a robot will avoid such mistakes is challenging.

== Successes in automated commonsense reasoning ==
Significant progress in the field of the automated commonsense reasoning is made in the areas of the taxonomic reasoning, actions and change reasoning, reasoning about time. Each of these spheres has a well-acknowledged theory for wide range of commonsense inferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O11-commonsensereasoning.html|title = Taxonomy|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taxonomic reasoning ===
Taxonomy is the collection of individuals and categories and their relations. Taxonomies are often referred to as semantic networks. Figure 2 displays a taxonomy of a few categories of individuals and animals.
[[File:Figure2ww.jpg|thumb|377x377px|Taxonomy
Figure 2&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RANGES - The Bathroom Studio|url = http://www.thebathroomstudio.net/ranges/|website = www.thebathroomstudio.net|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
]]

Three basic relations are demonstrated:
* An individual is an instance of a category. For example, the individual ''Tweety'' is an instance of the category ''robin''.
* One category is a subset of another. For instance ''robin'' is a subset of ''bird''.
* Two categories are disjoint. For instance ''robin'' is disjoint from ''penguin''.
Transitivity is one type of inference in taxonomy. Since ''Tweety'' is an instance of ''robin'' and ''robin'' is a subset of ''bird'', it follows that ''Tweety'' is an instance of ''bird''. Inheritance is another type of inference. Since ''Tweety'' is an instance of ''robin'', which is a subset of ''bird'' and ''bird'' is marked with property ''canfly'', it follows that ''Tweety'' and ''robin'' have property ''canfly''.  When an individual taxonomizes more abstract categories, outlining and delimiting specific categories becomes more problematic. Simple taxonomic structures are frequently used in AI programs. For instance, [[WordNet]] is a resource including a taxonomy, whose elements are meanings of English words. Web mining systems used to collect commonsense knowledge from Web documents focus on taxonomic relations and specifically in gathering taxonomic relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191169-commonsense-reasoning-and-commonsense-knowledge-in-artificial-intelligence/fulltext#body-5|title = Taxonomy|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Action and change ===
The theory of action, events and change is another range of the commonsense reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/someneed/node3.html|title = Action and change in Commonsense reasoning|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are established reasoning methods for domains that satisfy the constraints listed below:
* Events are atomic, meaning one event occurs at a time and the reasoner needs to consider the state and condition of the world at the start and at the finale of the specific event, but not during the states, while there is still an evidence of on-going changes (progress).
* Every single change is a result of some event
* Events are deterministic, meaning the world’s state at the end of the event is defined by the world’s state at the beginning and the specification of the event.
* There is a single actor and all events are his actions.
* The relevant state of the world at the beginning is either known or can be calculated.

=== Temporal reasoning ===
Temporal reasoning is the ability to make presumptions about humans' knowledge of times, durations and time intervals. For example, if an individual knows that Mozart was born after Hadyn and died earlier than him, they can use their temporal reasoning knowledge to deduce that Mozart had died younger than Hadyn. The inferences involved reduce themselves to solving systems of linear inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www-formal.stanford.edu/leora/commonsense/|title = Temporal reasoning|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; To integrate that kind of reasoning with concrete purposes, such as [[natural language understanding|natural language interpretation]], is more challenging, because natural language expressions have context dependent interpretation. Simple tasks such as assigning timestamps to procedures cannot be done with total accuracy.

=== Qualitative reasoning ===
Qualitative reasoning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/09/guide-to-common-sense-reasoning-whos-doing-it-and-why-it-matters/|title = Qualitative reasoning|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the form of commonsense reasoning analyzed with certain success. It is concerned with the direction of change in interrelated quantities. For instance, if the price of a stock goes up, the amount of stocks that are going to be sold will go down. If some ecosystem contains wolves and lambs and the number of wolves decreases, the death rate of the lambs will go down as well. This theory was firstly formulated by Johan de Kleer, who analyzed an object moving on a roller coaster. The theory of qualitative reasoning is applied in many spheres such as physics, biology, engineering, ecology, etc. It serves as the basis for many practical programs, analogical mapping, text understanding.

== Challenges in automating commonsense reasoning ==
As of 2014, there are some commercial systems trying to make the use of commonsense reasoning significant. However, they use statistical information as a proxy for commonsense knowledge, where reasoning is absent. Current programs manipulate individual words, but they don't attempt or offer further understanding.  Five major obstacles interfere with the producing of a satisfactory "commonsense reasoner".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.edx.org/course/artificial-intelligence-uc-berkeleyx-cs188-1x|title = Artificial Challenges|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, some of the domains that are involved in commonsense reasoning are only partly understood. Individuals are far from a comprehensive understanding of domains as communication and knowledge, interpersonal interactions or physical processes.

Second, situations that seem easily predicted or assumed about could have logical complexity, which humans’ commonsense knowledge does not cover. Some aspects of similar situations are studied and are well understood, but there are many relations that are unknown, even in principle and how they could be represented in a form that is usable by computers.

Third, commonsense reasoning involves plausible reasoning. It requires coming to a reasonable conclusion given what is already known. Plausible reasoning has been studied for many years and there are a lot of theories developed that include probabilistic reasoning and non-monotonic logic. It takes different forms that include using unreliable data and rules, whose conclusions are not certain sometimes.

Fourth, there are many domains, in which a small number of examples are extremely frequent, whereas there is a vast number of highly infrequent examples.

Fifth, when formulating pressumptions it is challenging to discern and determine the level of abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aaai.org/home.html|title = Association Artificial Intelligence|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared with humans, all existing computer programs perform extremely poorly on modern "commonsense reasoning" benchmark tests such as the [[Winograd Schema Challenge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Winograd Schema Challenge|url=https://cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/papers/WinogradSchemas/WS.html|website=cs.nyu.edu|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of attaining human-level competency at "commonsense knowledge" tasks is considered to probably be "[[AI complete]]" (that is, solving it would require the ability to synthesize a [[artificial general intelligence|human-level intelligence]]).&lt;ref&gt;Yampolskiy, Roman V. "AI-Complete, AI-Hard, or AI-Easy-Classification of Problems in AI." MAICS. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrich, C, Novosel, L, and Hrnkas, B. (2009). [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/59e3/495f4f1e70629e17ddbbce06834626b2a363.pdf Common Sense Knowledge]. Information Search and Retrieval, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches and techniques ==
Commonsense’s reasoning study is divided into knowledge-based approaches and approaches that are based on machine learning over and using a large data corpora with limited interactions between these two types of approaches. There are also crowdsourcing approaches, attempting to construct a knowledge basis by linking the collective knowledge and the input of non-expert people. Knowledge-based approaches can be separated into approaches based on mathematical logic.

In knowledge-based approaches, the experts are analyzing the characteristics of the inferences that are required to do reasoning in a specific area or for a certain task. The knowledge-based approaches consist of mathematically grounded approaches, informal knowledge-based approaches and large-scale approaches. The mathematically grounded approaches are purely theoretical and the result is a printed paper instead of a program. The work is limited to the range of the domains and the reasoning techniques that are being reflected on. In informal knowledge-based approaches, theories of reasoning are based on anecdotal data and intuition that are results from empirical behavioral psychology. Informal approaches are common in computer programming. Two other popular techniques for extracting commonsense knowledge from Web documents involve [[Web mining]] and [[Crowd sourcing]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="802">A '''contingent beneficiary''' is someone who benefits from a [[Contingent contracts|contingent contract]]; they [[profit (economics)|profit]] from a [[promise]], which may or may be fulfilled, to do or abstain from doing a certain thing. This matter itself is realized only on the happening of some future uncertain event.

In the context of an [[insurance policy]], the condition is generally the death of the insurance contract holder; the party who benefits is referred to as the primary [[beneficiary]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Virginia; Morris, Kenneth.

'''Diesel therapy''' is a form of punishment in which prisoners are shackled and then transported for days or weeks.&lt;ref&gt; 
 While some see it as deliberate puishment, it is usually just the result of a transport network run for the convenience of law enforcement and not the prisoners.  One van may make a journey from Washington D.C. to Atlanta and take 10 days to arrive, but that is because over the journey many different passengers are picked up and dropped off along the way in destinations that are not along the direct route.{{citation|volume=38|publisher=Willamette L.

Margaret Stroebe and Henk Schut studied [[grief]] in "The Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement: A Decade On".  In this study, the models of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] were examined and how it could be of benefit compared to others.  They came up with a dual process model to represent human grief. They explain coping with [[Grief|bereavement]], a state of loss can be a combination of accepting and confronting it. It informs on how the combination of healthy emotional [[catharsis]] and changing perspective can be a good and healthy process to cope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stroebe|first=Margaret|last2=Schut|first2=Henk|date=1999|title=The Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement: Rationale and Description|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/074811899201046|journal=Death Studies|volume=23|issue=3|pages=197–224|doi=10.1080/074811899201046|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to confront the situation and also deal with everyday life events allows the person to live their lives with desired states of stability in a subjective post-loss world in which bereaved persons find themselves (Parkes, 1993){{Full citation needed|date=April 2018}}.

==Coping==
Bereavement and the adjective bereaved derive from a verb, 'reave', which means "to despoil, rob, or forcibly deprive" according to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]. Thus, a bereaved person is one who has been deprived, robbed, plundered, or stripped of someone or something that they valued. Reaction to this state or impact of loss is called grief. According to Lazarus and Folkman (1984),{{Full citation needed|date=April 2018}} coping strategies are the "constantly changing cognitive and behavioural efforts to manage specific external and/or internal demands that are appraised as taxing on or exceeding the resources of the person". People vary in the ways that they grieve and also in the way that they cope. But, acknowledging it and allowing themselves to go through the motions will allow them to cope in a healthy way. To cope with the loss, the person requires to relearn the world around them and simultaneously make a multifaceted transition from loving in presence to loving in absence (Attig, 2001).{{Full citation needed|date=April 2018}} A healthy relocation of the deceased internally and maintaining a healthy dynamic connectedness/relationship is observed to provide solace to the grieving, but the weightage differed in [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] cultural settings. Grievers will go through times of extreme sadness and also times where they are numb to what has happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6ISrB6wpb0C&amp;pg=PA71|title=Loss, Bereavement and Grief: A Guide to Effective Caring|author1=Spall|first=Bob|author2=Callis|first2=Stephen|date=January 1997|publisher=Nelson Thornes|year=|isbn=978-0-7487-3322-4|location=|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of appropriate coping can bring many ailments to a person including mental and physical ailments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richardson|first=Virginia E.|date=2010-12-01|title=The Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement: A Decade Later|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2190/OM.61.4.a|journal=OMEGA - Journal of Death and Dying|volume=61|issue=4|pages=269–271|doi=10.2190/OM.61.4.a|via=SAGE Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coping through mourning in a state of bereavement is advised in the [[Bible]] as "Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted."&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 5:4, NRSV&lt;/ref&gt; Because it helps to achieve growth through thorough acceptance of loss, the transforming capacity of profound human experiences. Freud in 1959 through an article called this as a process of "working through" the grief. Healthy coping is achieved when the bereaved person is enabled to go forward with healthy, productive living by effortfully developing "new normals" to guide that living which is characterized by lesser stressful demands compared to initial phase of grief.

Greenblatt has reviewed spousal mourning is essential for transition. He describes 4 phases of mourning: the initial reaction of shock, numbness, denial and disbelief; followed by pining,  yearning,  depression then in a healthy environment resolution phase begins with emancipation from the loved one and readjustment to the new environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenblatt|first=M.|date=1978-01-01|title=The grieving spouse|url=https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.135.1.43|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=135|issue=1|pages=43–47|doi=10.1176/ajp.135.1.43|issn=0002-953X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dual process model==
===Loss oriented===
The loss oriented process focuses on coping with bereavement, the loss itself, recognizing it and accepting it. In this process a person will express feelings of grief with all the losses that occur from losing their loved one. There will be many changes from work to family and friendships. There might also be demographic changes and even economic ones. During this time, people either acknowledge these changes head or [[Rumination (psychology)|ruminate]] on feelings of lose which might lead to distorted, [[Complicated grief disorder|complicated]] or [[Prolonged grief disorder|prolonged]] grief. The loss oriented process will bring on a lot of yearning, irritability, despair, anxiety and depression. During this process they are only concentrated on their pain that this loss has caused. Lack or denial of early adaptive acknowledgement that they will no longer speak to deceased or see them again might instigate compulsive and self-destructive behaviors. People attached with the deceased have to reconfigure their identity as an autonomous being. These process in a non-resilient griever can appear overwhelming, and associated guilt can be exported over friends and family in an assumptive effort which might affect interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fasse|first=Léonor|last2=Zech|first2=Emmanuelle|date=2015|title=The Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement in the test of the subjective experiences of bereaved spouses.

===Restoration oriented===
In restoration-oriented process, the loss of the loved one is accepted and attachments with the deceased are relinquished. These include focusing on the new roles in their post loss reality and responsibilities in lives. The restoration-oriented process incorporates endurance through reconstruction of perspective by taking over grief, grieving thoughts are adjusted adaptively by creating new meanings with the deceased. The restoration process is a confrontation process, that allows the person to adjust with the world without the deceased. People in this process can feel subjective oscillations of pride and grief related stressors in the avoidance [[mentalization]]. This process allows the person to live their daily life as a changed individual without being consumed by the grieving they are facing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennett|first=Kate M.|last2=Gibbons|first2=Kerry|last3=MacKenzie-Smith|first3=Suzanna|date=2010-12-01|title=Loss and Restoration in Later Life: An Examination of Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2190/OM.61.4.d|journal=OMEGA - Journal of Death and Dying|volume=61|issue=4|pages=315–332|doi=10.2190/OM.61.4.d|via=SAGE Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeffreys2004"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jrr1eB4lsuEC&amp;pg=PA46|title=Helping Grieving People: A Handbook for Care Providers|author=Jeffreys|first=J.

Rando calls the letting go process as emancipation from bondage due to the strength required for change and recovery.

==Conclusion==
The dual process model of coping takes into consideration that everyone will have stressful life events, while they are coping with bereavement. Their lives will continue and so will the problems associated with it. There will be many situations that will take them away from grieving. These situations can either benefit them or affect them negatively if they allow them to. Being aware and prepared to change can allow them to continue and deal with post loss life events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stroebe|first=Margaret|last2=Schut|first2=Henk|date=2010-12-01|title=The Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement: A Decade on|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2190/OM.61.4.b|journal=OMEGA - Journal of Death and Dying|volume=61|issue=4|pages=273–289|doi=10.2190/OM.61.4.b|via=SAGE Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Duncan Cameron "Cam" Reed''' (July 2, 1815 - September 14, 1890) was an American [[steamship]] [[marine propulsion|engineer]] and politician, an early settler of [[Milwaukee]]. He served two terms as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of the [[Wisconsin State Senate]], and as [[coroner]] of [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]]. He served briefly as an [[officer (military)|officer]] in the [[American Civil War]], then went to work as a boiler inspector.

==Background==
Reed was born in [[Shelburn, Vermont]] on July 2, 1815. He became a [[marine engineer]], and had visited Milwaukee at least as early as 1834. He moved to Milwaukee permanently on July 8, 1841, arriving as [[chief engineer]] of the steamship ''City of Milwaukee'' or ''Milwaukee'' (reputedly "the fastest boat on the [[Great Lakes|lakes]] at that time"), which he had helped to sneak out of the harbor of [[Buffalo, New York]] at the instigation of [[Solomon Juneau]], part-owner thereof, who claimed that the boat was being retained in Buffalo unjustly by the other owners. He remained in the engineering trade, serving on lake steamers such as the ''C. C. Trowbridge'',&lt;ref&gt;Buck, James Smith ''Pioneer History of Milwaukee: 1840-1846'' Vol. 2. Milwaukee: Milwaukee News Company, 1881; pp. 114, 145, 195&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Andromeda'' and the ''Nucleus''.&lt;ref&gt;Wisconsin Supreme Court. ''Wisconsin Reports: Cases Determined in the Supreme Court of Wisconsin'' Volume 2; Chicago: Bernard Callaghan, 1855; p. 462, 463, 474&lt;/ref&gt; In 1851, he was one of a group (including [[Alexander Mitchell (Wisconsin politician)|Alexander Mitchell]], [[George H. Walker]], [[Increase Lapham]] and others) which petitioned the state legislature for a charter for the [[Milwaukee and Fond du Lac Railroad]], one of the short-lived railroad companies which would eventually become part of the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]] system.&lt;ref&gt;"Milwaukee and Fond du Lac Railroad" ''[[Milwaukee Sentinel|Milwaukee Daily Sentinel and Gazette]]'' February 10, 1851 (Issue 52); col. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public office==
As of 1853, he was 37 years of age; his biographical listing showed that he was an "engineer", was born in [[Vermont]] and had lived in Wisconsin for 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1853 ''Manual for the Use of the Assembly, of the State of Wisconsin, for the Year 1853'' Madison: Brown and Carpenter, Printers, 1853; p. 85]&lt;/ref&gt; Reed served four years (1850-1853) as a Democratic member of the State Senate, first from the [[Wisconsin Senate, District 18|Eighteenth District]], then (after a [[redistricting]]) from the [[Wisconsin Senate, District 6|Sixth]].

He served four years as a deputy [[United States Marshal]]; and in 1858 was elected [[coroner]] for [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=article&amp;did=WI.V008.DWJones&amp;id=WI.V008&amp;isize=M&amp;q1=Duncan%20C.%20Reed Jones, D.

Randall, governor of the state of Wisconsin, and accompanying documents (1860 &amp;#91;Covers 1858/1859&amp;#93;)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==
In 1853 Reed was a [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] of the First Regiment, First Division of the Wisconsin [[Militia]] under [[Major General]] [[Rufus King]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.library.wisc.edu/WI/EFacs/WIPublicDocs/WIPublicDocs01/V001/reference/wi.v001.wlutley.pdf Utley, William L.

On August 21, 1862, he was commissioned a Captain of the [[24th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] (which "Cam" had helped organize) commanding Company "E"; but he was discharged in January 1863.

==After the Civil War==
After the war, he worked as a professional [[boiler]] [[inspector]], billing various state agencies for that service. He was appointed a boiler inspector for the [[Steamboat]] Inspection Service of the United States government during the [[Ulysses S Grant|Grant administration]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1879 Warner, Hans B., ed.

Madison: David Atwood, State Printer, 1879; p. 414]&lt;/ref&gt; a position he would hold until his death.

==Personal life==

'''Friedrich Uebelhoer''' (born 25 September 1893 in [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] – presumed died 1945) was a [[Germany|German]] politician and official with the [[Nazi Party]].

==Early life==
Uebelhoer served as an officer in the [[German Imperial Army]] in the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name="Unger"&gt;Michal Unger, ''Reassessment of the Image of Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski'', Wallstein Verlag, 2004, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the Nazi Party initially in 1922 then again in 1925, following the revocation of the ban placed on the group after the [[Munich putsch]].&lt;ref name="Klee"&gt;Ernst Klee, ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945'', Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, Zweite aktualisierte Auflage, Frankfurt am Main 2005, p. 633.&lt;/ref&gt;

He became [[Kreisleiter]] in [[Naumburg (Saale)]] in 1931.&lt;ref name="Klee"/&gt; He was Mayor of Naumburg from 1933 to 1939 and also served as head of the [[National Socialist People's Welfare]] in Gau Halle-Merseburg.&lt;ref name="Klee"/&gt;

==SS activity==
Uebelhoer held the rank of [[Brigadeführer]] in the [[Schutzstaffel]] and received commendation for his involvement in the annexation of the [[Sudetenland]] and for his part in the [[Anschluss]].&lt;ref name="Unger"/&gt; Following the occupation of [[Poland]], he served as an inspector in the [[Reichsgau Wartheland]].&lt;ref name="Klee"/&gt; In [[Łódź]] he ordered the construction of the [[Łódź Ghetto|Jewish ghetto]] on December 10, 1939, a measure he described as only temporary, adding that ultimately the Nazis intended to "burn out this plague dump".&lt;ref&gt;Willi Jasper, "[http://www.zeit.de/1995/29/Wozu_noch_Welt_?page=all ‚Wozu noch Welt?‘]", ''Die Zeit'' 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In early October 1941, Uebelhoer drew the ire of [[Reinhard Heydrich]] when he vehemently protested against the intended deportation of 60,000 German Jews to the already overcrowded ghetto.  In letters to one another, Heydrich threatened to draw "appropriate conclusions" if Uebelhoer did not change his stance.  Through negotiations with [[Adolf Eichmann]], the number eventually reached was 20,000 Jews and 5,000 Gypsies sent to Łódź, with tens of thousands sent to other ghettos.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=205}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=546–47}}  In November that year, to assuage Uebelhoer's qualms about ghetto arson started by Gypsies, [[Heinrich Himmler]] advised Uebelhoer to shoot ten Gypsies for every fire that broke out within the ghetto.  Those Gypsies who did not perish in the Łódź Ghetto were killed by gas vans in January 1942 in [[Chełmno extermination camp|Chełmno]].{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=669}}

Uebelhoer was dismissed from his post as governor of Łódź in December 1942 after being accused of embezzlement by [[Arthur Greiser]].&lt;ref name="Unger"/&gt; The charges were ultimately unproven, but the suspicion damaged his reputation and halted his advancement in the SS.&lt;ref name="Unger"/&gt; He would return in January 1944 in the lesser role of governor of the [[Merseburg]] district.&lt;ref name="Unger"/&gt;

Uebelhoer disappeared in the latter days of the [[Second World War]] and remained unaccounted for. He was declared legally dead in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redcap70.net/A%20History%20of%20the%20SS%20Organisation%201924-1945.html/U/UEBELHOER,%20Friedrich.html UEBELHOER, Friedrich]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biology]], '''gonochorism''' (''[[Greek language|Greek]]'' offspring + disperse) or '''unisexualism''' or '''gonochory''' describes the state of having just one of at least two distinct sexes in any one individual organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gonochorism|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/research/projects/cestode-life-cycle/database/glossary.jsp#G|work=Glossary|publisher=The Natural History Museum|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often used with animals, in which the individual organisms are often gonochorous. Gonochory is less common in [[plantae|plants]]. For example, in [[flowering plant]]s, individual flowers may be hermaphroditic (i.e. with both stamens and ovaries) or gonochorous (unisexual), having either no stamens (i.e. no male parts) or no ovaries (i.e. no female parts). Among flowering plant species that have unisexual flowers, some also produce hermaphrodite flowers, and the three types occur in different arrangements on separate plants; species can be [[monoecious]], [[dioecious]], [[trioecious]], [[polygamomonoecious]], [[polygamodioecious]], [[andromonoecious]], or [[gynomonoecious]].

[[File:Schistosome_Parasite_SEM.jpg|right|thumb|Unlike most [[Platyhelminthes|flatworms]], [[Schistosoma|schistosomes]] are gonochoristic. The narrow female can be seen emerging from the thicker male's gynecophoral canal below his ventral sucker.]] 

Sex is most often genetically determined, but may be determined by other mechanisms. For example, [[alligator]]s use [[temperature-dependent sex determination]] during egg incubation. Examples of gonochoric or dioecious [[pollination]] include [[holly|hollies]] and [[kiwifruit]]. In these plants the male plant that supplies the [[pollen]] is referred to as the [[pollenizer]].

Gonochorism stands in contrast to other [[reproductive strategy|reproductive strategies]] such as [[asexual reproduction]] and [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditism]]. The sex of an individual may also change during its lifetime – this [[sequential hermaphroditism]] can for example be found in [[parrotfish]]&lt;ref&gt;Bester, C. ''[http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Gallery/Descript/Sparrotfish/SParrotfish.html Stoplight parrotfish]'' Florida Museum of Natural History, Ichthyology Department. Accessed 15-12-2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Afonsoa&gt;Afonsoa, Moratoa &amp; Santos (2008). ''Spatial patterns in reproductive traits of the temperate parrotfish Sparisoma cretense.''

'''HMT ''Islay'' (T172)''' was a British [[Royal Navy]] [[Isles class trawler|Isles class]] [[naval trawler|armed trawler]] of the [[Second World War]].

While under the command of C. H. L. Clarke [[Royal Navy Reserve|RNR]], on 28 June 1942, ''Islay'' picked up 19 survivors from the British [[Merchant ship|merchant]] [[Steamship|steamer]] {{SS|Zealand||2}} which had been hit by two [[torpedo]]es from the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[submarine]] [[German submarine U-97 (1940)|''U-97'']] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the southwest of [[Haifa]] and had sunk with the loss of 14 crew members and gunners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/1862.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 August 1942, ''Islay'' sank the [[Italy|Italian]] submarine [[Italian submarine Scirè (1938)|''Scirè'']] in [[Haifa Bay]] while under the command of [[Lieutenant Commander]] John Ross of [[North Shields, Tyne and Wear]], who was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for his actions. ''Scirè'' was carrying 11 ''[[Decima Flottiglia MAS]]'' commandos, who were intending to attack shipping in Haifa harbour by means of [[human torpedoes]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iantdexpeditions.com/notizie/2008/scireen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Royal Air Force]] aircraft and [[coastal artillery]] also were involved in the sinking, which had been facilitated by [[Ultra]] intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marina.difesa.it/documentazione/editoria/Pagine/BollettinodArchivio.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scirè'' had previously launched human torpedo attacks on British naval units in [[Gibraltar]] and [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]].

In October 1946, the ship was sold into commercial service. Operating under the French flag as ''Sainte Anne'', she disappeared without trace in the Mediterranean Sea after a last communication while off the [[Balearic Islands]] on 15 March 1950.&lt;ref name=BelgeHO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.belgischekoopvaardij.net/belgian%20merchant%20H-O%2024.5.04.pdf |title=Belgian Merchant H-O |publisher=Belgische Koopvaardij |accessdate=31 October 2010 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Infradian rhythm''' is, in [[chronobiology]] a rhythm with a duration longer than that of a [[circadian rhythm]], i.e. with a frequency less than one cycle in 28 hours,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Frederick M. &amp; Graeber, R. Curtis, eds.  The Rhythmic Aspects of Behavior. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. 1982, (p.462).&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[menstrual cycle]], breeding and tidal or seasonal rhythms. [[Ultradian rhythm]]s by contrast, have periods shorter than the period of a circadian rhythm. A number of infradian rhythms are known to be caused by hormone stimulation or exogenous factors for example [[seasonal depression]], linked to the lowering of light levels during [[winter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychteacher.co.uk/biologicalrhythms/infradian_ultradian_rhythms.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Lanning Barber''' (March 24, 1864 – April 6, 1940) was a medical doctor and a member of the [[Wisconsin State Senate]] and the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]].

==Biography==
Barber was born on March 24, 1864 in [[Hayton, Wisconsin]]. He attended the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. In 1899, he married Ella Webb. Their daughter, [[Mildred Barber Abel]], became a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly. It marked the first time a father and daughter served together in a state legislature in the history of the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marathoncountyhistory.org/PeopleDetails.php?PeopleId=263|title=Barber Abel, Mildred|publisher=Marathon County Historical Society|accessdate=2012-01-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225020253/http://www.marathoncountyhistory.org/PeopleDetails.php?PeopleId=263|archivedate=2016-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barber was a member of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], as well as [[Modern Woodmen of America]].

After Barber first began practicing medicine, he became Health Officer of [[Greenwood, Wisconsin]] and Coroner of [[Clark County, Wisconsin]] before moving to [[Collins, Wisconsin]]. He moved to [[Marathon City, Wisconsin]] in 1906&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dr. Joseph Barber, Progressive Party Mainstay, Succumbs|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4342312/joseph_l_barber_18641940/|newspaper=The Post-Crescent|date=April 6, 1940|page=1|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate =February 17, 2016 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened a practice and later a [[pharmacy]].

After serving as President of [[Marathon, Wisconsin]], Barber was elected to the Senate in 1922, where he served two terms.

'''Joseph Watson, 1st Baron Manton''' (10 February 1873 – 13 March 1922) was an English industrialist from [[Leeds]], Yorkshire.

He was chairman of Joseph Watson &amp; Sons Ltd, soap manufacturers, of [[Leeds]] and a [[board of directors|director]] of the [[London and North-Western Railway]], in the late 19th century the largest [[joint stock company]] in the world. He became in later life a pioneer of industrialised agriculture in England and a successful racehorse owner.&lt;ref name=Venn&gt;{{acad|id= WT890J|name=Watson, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was step-great-grandfather to [[David Cameron]], former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;His 2nd son Hon. Robert Fraser Watson (1900–1975) married in 1961 (as his 2nd wife) Enid Levita (d.1995),(Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.739, Baron Manton; p.577, Mount baronets) formerly wife of Ewen Donald Cameron, grandfather of David Cameron&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Watson was the only son of George Watson, soap manufacturer, of Donisthorpe House near [[Moor Allerton]], Leeds, [[Yorkshire]]. He was educated at [[Repton School]] and [[Clare College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=Venn /&gt; he was recalled to the family firm before completing his degree, becoming chairman at a young age.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Soap business==

===Joseph Watson &amp; Sons===

The company, known locally as "Soapy Joe's" was based after 1861 at the Whitehall Road Soapworks, Leeds, strategically placed between the River Aire, from which [[palm oil]] shipped in from around the world was unloaded, and the former railway terminal, from which the finished product was dispatched. It became one of the largest employers in the city, producing brands such as "Matchless Cleanser", "Venus" and "Nubolic".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}|group="nb"|name=""}}

===Soap Trust monopoly===
[[File:Soaptrust.jpg|thumb|300px|Cartoon from The ''Daily Mirror'', 22 October 1906. A parody of William Lever, whose factory was named "[[Port Sunlight]]".]]
On 4 August 1906 Watson and William Lever, by then the largest manufacturer, met in the [[St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel|Grand Hotel]] in London to finalise a plan to set up a "Soap Trust" which would merge the major soap manufacturers into a monopoly, thereby gaining economies of scale in advertising and production costs. Watson favoured the use of a parent company whilst Lever preferred a scheme of exchange of shares between participating companies to bind them together. This occurred during a period of many corporate trusts in the United States.{{#tag:ref|The scheme was in imitation of hundreds of similar trusts which had been established in the USA following [[John D. Rockefeller]]'s pioneering organisation of the [[Standard Oil]] Co. in 1882 as a virtual monopoly combination of many small independent oil companies. The manufacturers in their idealism foresaw benefits from trusts to both consumer and producer from economies of scale, yet abuses occurred. A sugar trust evaded $4M of customs duty, and the creation of a beef trust seemed a threat to cheap food supplies. The dangers to the consumer were soon understood by the politicians and the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] of 1890 was the response. The Act was not totally successful and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in his second presidency launched a new "trust-busting" policy at about the same time the British soap trust was being established.|group="nb"}} The scheme was strongly opposed by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper which campaigned for a boycott by its readers of the trust brands. Profits at participating firms were thereby severely reduced. The Northcliffe Press in its expanding and highly popular campaign overstepped the mark by falsely asserting trust soaps to be made from scented fish oil. Although Watson and Lever won substantial libel damages from the press, losses in reputation and profits had been suffered all round. On the proposal of Watson and Crosfield, another large manufacturer, the scheme was abandoned in November 1906. By then Watson had already disposed of much of his shareholding, previously all held by himself and his uncle Charles, to William Lever, in exchange for [[Lever Brothers]] shares to set up the trust.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Wilson. (1954). ''The History of Unilever.'' London: Cassell. '''1'''. Chapter 6, The Crisis of 1906, pp. 72–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lever Brothers and Jurgens===
[[File:SoapyJoesShaft.jpg|thumb|200px|"Soapy Joe's Shaft", Whitehall Rd. Leeds. A surviving ventilation shaft of the former Leeds Electricity Dept., which sub-station stood adjacent on the north to Whitehall Soap Works]] 
In 1912/13 Watson sold much of his remaining shareholding to Lever ([[Lever Brothers]] Ltd., later [[Unilever]]) and sold to him the remainder in July 1917, but remained as chairman. He had sold his half share in the Planter's Margarine Co Ltd. to Lever in July 1915, a joint venture established in November 1914 at Godley in Cheshire with Levers, in response to Government anxiety at the wartime loss of Dutch supplies, which by 1915 was the country's second largest margarine manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, I, pp.227–9&lt;/ref&gt; He had supplied it from his Olympia Oil &amp; Cake Co. Ltd. at Selby, Yorks which operated the largest linseed oil crushing and refining plant in Europe. It also hardened whale oil and in 1917 during WWI was allocated by the government 21% (later 25%) of British whale oil for hardening.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, I, p.239; Lever's had 47% and Crosfield's 32%&lt;/ref&gt; Watson then suffered substantial losses in an unsuccessful speculation in linseed and he sold Olympia Oil &amp; Cake to the Dutch firm [[Antonius Johannes Jurgens|Jurgens]], which had outbid Levers.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, I, p.249&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pioneer of industrialised agriculture==
Spurred on by wartime food shortages, Watson began the pioneering of industrialised agriculture, and he funded the Agricultural Research Department at [[Leamington Spa]]. He founded the Olympia Agricultural Co Ltd. and invested much of his proceeds into agricultural estates totalling some {{convert|20000|acre|km2}} at Selby (Yorks), the 5,500 acre Manton Down Estate (Wiltshire), Sudbourne (Suffolk), [[Offchurch]] (Warwickshire)&lt;ref&gt;W.G. Rimmer. (1961). "Men Who Made Leeds." ''Leeds Journal.'' 32: pp.&amp;nbsp;143–6.&lt;/ref&gt; and at Thorney (Cambridgeshire).&lt;ref&gt;McKie&lt;/ref&gt; His Olympia Oil &amp; Cake Co. under the brand name "OCO"  produced animal feeds for dairy cows, calves, lambs and pigs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Olympia_Oil_and_Cake_Co#cite_note-2&lt;/ref&gt; all from the new source of linseed oil. The company acquired sites near Selby within the parish of [[Barlby]] between 1909–10 and their buildings later dominated the road and river frontages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=23002  Victoria County History (VCH), County of York East Riding, Volume 3: Ouse and Derwent wapentake, and part of Harthill wapentake (1976), pp. 47–52 Hemingbrough: Barlby]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after 1910 the company built the first "village estate" of workers' housing in the area which was later expanded by other nearby employers. Before 1921 the "Olympia Hotel" opened near the site at Barlby Bank, which took its name from the company and used a sign showing seed-crushing machinery.&lt;ref&gt;VCH&lt;/ref&gt; The company since 1952 became part of British Oil and Cake Mills Ltd.

Following Manton's death his executors claimed he had put £1,000,000 into agriculture and received £750,000 from sales of the properties.

==Wartime munitions work==
[[File:WatsonLloydGeorgeTelegram.jpg|thumb|300px|Telegram of 21 June 1916 from Lloyd George to Watson. [[Amatol]] is an explosive consisting of TNT and Ammonium Nitrate.]]
At the start of the [[First World War]] Watson's industrial and organisational expertise was used to assist the government in the establishment and operation of national munitions factories, most notably at the First National Shell Filling Factory at [[Barnbow]], Leeds.&lt;ref name=Cox /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;

Following the heavy consumption of munitions in the opening battles of WWI at the Somme, the ''Northcliffe Press'' (''[[Daily Mail]]'') brought to the public's attention what became known as "[[Shell Crisis of 1915|The Shell Crisis]]", signifying that the nation had given little thought to securing long-term munitions supplies needed to successfully wage an unprecedented protracted war. The [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]] government fell, to be replaced by that of [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]], recently appointed Minister of Munitions to resolve the crisis. Watson as chairman of a six-man "Leeds Munitions Committee" made up from local industrialists, formed in August 1915, was charged by the government to immediately establish the first of 12 National Shell Filling Factories. A factory was promptly established on a {{convert|400|acre|km2|adj=on}} greenfield site at Barnbow, close to Leeds. It resembled a small town of detached houses and huts more than a traditional factory, to contain and localise any accidental explosions. It remained the largest such operation in the country, having despatched 566,000 tons of finished ammunition overseas by the Armistice. At its height it employed 16,000 workers, 93% of whom were women and girls.{{#tag:ref|Two members of the directing board were on duty at Barnbow every day, and the board met at least once a month to receive reports. The factory was largely self-contained for reasons of national security, operating under great secrecy. It operated its own farm including dairy and slaughterhouse. Kitchens and accounting department were equipped with the latest electric machinery.

Joppa Tannery was built in 1828 by Harold's father Richard Nickols as an expansion from the small tannery he had established in Bramley in 1823. The Joppa Tannery employed 300–400 people at its height and produced "upper leather" for shoes. It closed briefly but was re-openrd by Harold Nickols in 1900 under the name "Harold Nickols Ltd". It continued to be run by Harold's son Richard III Nickols, and closed in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leodis.net/Display.aspx?resourceIdentifier=2314 Leodis – A Photographic Archive of Leeds]&lt;/ref&gt; Watson had four sons by Claire Nickols:&lt;ref&gt;Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.739&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Judgment Night'''" is episode 10 of the [[American television]] anthology series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''.

==Opening narration==
{{cquote|Her name is the S.S. Queen of Glasgow. Her registry: British. Gross tonnage: five thousand. Age: Interdeterminate. At this moment she's one day out of Liverpool, her destination New York. Duly recorded on the ship's log is the sailing time, course to destination, weather conditions, temperature, longitude and latitude. But what is never recorded in a log is the fear that washes over a deck like fog and ocean spray. Fear like the throbbing strokes of engine pistons, each like a heartbeat, parceling out of every hour into breathless minutes of watching, waiting and dreading... For the year is 1942, and this particular ship has lost its convoy. It travels alone like an aged blind thing groping through the unfriendly dark, stalked by unseen periscopes of steel killers. Yes, the Queen of Glasgow is a frightened ship, and she carries with her a premonition of death.}}

==Plot==
A man is seen standing aboard the deck of a British [[cargo liner]] crossing the Atlantic in 1942. The man's name is Carl Lanser and he appears disoriented, with no idea of how he got aboard or who he really is. He is staring into a thick fog when a man calls him to dinner. He enters the ship's dining cabin and joins the crew and passengers. The captain discusses German [[U-boats]] seen in the area and tries to reassure the nervous passengers that there is no sign that the ship has caught the attention of any lurking "[[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpacks]]." Lanser becomes annoyed and, displaying an unusually comprehensive knowledge of submarines, explains in great detail that a single ship would be of no interest to a wolfpack and instead would most likely be pursued by a single submarine. The diners ask Lanser about his profession and how long he has been in England. Lanser hesitantly tells them that he has not been there long and that he was born in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt, Germany]]. Lanser appears confused, claims that he is ill and takes his leave.

While still on deck, he speaks to a female passenger whom he met at the dinner. Lanser explains to her that he has no memory of how he came aboard the ship – he knows who he is and finds each of the passengers and crew dimly familiar but can't recall specific details. His irritation grows and he begins to rant about impending doom. The captain, suspicious due to Lanser's claims of German nationality, sends an officer to escort him to the bridge. His suspicion is compounded when Lanser cannot provide details of his life and does not have his passport on hand to verify his identity. A steward is sent to Lanser's cabin. The steward finds the cap of a German naval officer among Lanser's possessions as he helps him unpack. Inspecting it in private, Lanser discovers that sewn into the lining of the cap is his own name. Disturbed, he leaves for the ship's bar.

On the bridge, the captain and first officer are faced with a dilemma posed by the ship's engines. They are long due an overhaul and cannot maintain top speed without generating noise and thus giving away their position to any lurking U-boats. Stopping for repairs will leave them without chance of escape should they be attacked. Down in the bar, Lanser is drinking but remarks to the bartender that the engines "don't sound right" and that they are laboring. The ship comes to a halt to effect repairs at 12:05 which causes Lanser to undergo a moment of realization. Despite the crew's reassurances, he becomes certain that the ship will be attacked and announces that they will all be killed at 1:15. Unable to convince the crew of the danger, Lanser runs throughout the vessel desperately trying to persuade the other passengers to abandon ship only to find the corridors and cabins now mysteriously empty. At 1:15, a searchlight illuminates the deck and Lanser watches in horror as a surfaced U-boat, commanded by a [[Captain lieutenant]] Carl Lanser, immediately begins shelling the British ship. Lanser and the other passengers, now having reappeared, are killed as the ship sinks, with Lanser suffering the agony of watching the innocent people die at precisely the time that he had predicted and being powerless to help them.

Some time later, Captain Lanser is in his cabin aboard the U-boat, recording that night's kill. With him is the second-in-command, Lt. Mueller, who is deeply disturbed by their merciless killing of civilians and speculates whether the crew of the U-boat are now damned. Unconcerned, Lanser replies they "most certainly are" in the eyes of the British, but Mueller fears they are now damned in the eyes of [[God]]. Despite Lanser's skepticism of the idea, Mueller believes that they may be condemned to relive the final moments of the passengers on the doomed ship for eternity. Mueller's fears are realized – the attacking U-boat and its crew are condemned to sink the defenseless vessel over and over, with Lanser as an unwitting victim among those slaughtered without mercy. The story thus recounts Carl Lanser's private [[hell]] as the former U-boat commander re-materializes on the deck of the ship and the nightmare begins again...

==Closing narration==
{{cquote|"The S.S. Queen of Glasgow, heading for New York, and the time is 1942. For one man it is ''always'' 1942—and this man will ride the ghost ship every night for eternity. This is what is meant by paying the fiddler. This is the comeuppance awaiting every man when the ledger of his life is opened and examined, the tally made, and then the reward or the penalty paid. And in the case of Carl Lanser, former Kapitan Lieutenant, Navy of the Third Reich, this is the penalty. This is the justice meted out. This is judgment night in the Twilight Zone."}}

==Episode notes==
In the first 18 episodes, Serling only had one minor conflict with CBS regarding episode content.  In an interview with [[Mike Wallace]] on September 22, 1959, Serling said, "We changed, in eighteen scripts, Mike, we have had one line changed, which, again, was a little ludicrous but of insufficient basic concern within the context of the story, not to put up a fight. On a bridge of a British ship, a sailor calls down to the galley and asks in my script for a pot of tea, because I believe that it's constitutionally acceptable in the British Navy to drink tea. One of my sponsors happens to sell [[instant coffee]] ([[Sanka]]), and he took great umbrage, or at least minor umbrage anyway, with the idea of saying tea. Well, we had a couple of swings back and forth, nothing serious, and we decided we'd ask for a tray to be sent up to the bridge. But in eighteen scripts, that's the only conflict we've had."

In the 1960 issue of ''Broadcasting'', Serling complained: "You can't 'ford' a river if it's sponsored by Chevy; you can't offer someone a 'match' if it's sponsored by Ronson lighters." And ''The Twilight Zone Companion'' joked that it was a good thing the sponsor didn't figure out people could drink water else the episode would have happened on dry land.

The '''Karl May Museum''' is a museum in [[Radebeul]], Germany named after the German author [[Karl May]], containing artifacts from May's life as well as from life on the [[American frontier]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] life of that era.

==Museum history==
German author [[Karl May]] (1842–1912), wrote many books about the [[American frontier]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] featuring the fictional characters [[Winnetou]] (a Mescalero-Apache Chief) and [[Old Shatterhand]] (a white European settler). Mays' books were popular in Germany and created a mystique about the "Wild West" in German popular culture.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  

The museum opened in 1928 in [[Radebeul]], in the house where May had lived, called Villa Shatterhand.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;  It was founded during a peak of interest in the US frontier and native Americans, fostered in part by the [[Sarrasani]] circus, which was headquartered in nearby [[Dresden]], and which was very popular in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=Weaver&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weaver|first1=Jace|title=Other Words: American Indian Literature, Law, and Culture|date=2001|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806133522|language=en|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQj_aQhYvfEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84}} Sarassani and Native American members of the circus came to the opening, and the Native Americans performed death songs for May.&lt;ref name=Weaver/&gt;{{rp|84}}  

The museum was founded by May's widow and an eccentric Austrian named [[:de:Patty Frank|Ernst Tobis]], who was a fan of May's work and had travelled to the American frontier, and liked to tell [[tall tales]] about his time there.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Tobis donated a large collection of artifacts to help found the museum's collection, which included 17 [[Scalping|scalps]], some of them from Native Americans.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Knight2/&gt;

When the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] took over Germany, they appropriated the museum and the image of May, and were especially focused on swastikas that appeared in some of the Native American artwork.  Hitler Youth were encouraged to visit the museum and to hear stories from Tobis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penny|first1=H. Glenn|title=Kindred by Choice: Germans and American Indians Since 1800|date=2013|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=9781469607641|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HV4DAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166|language=en|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, the original museum was in [[East Germany]] and a replica was built in [[Bamburg]] in [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name=Weaver/&gt;{{rp|73}} A person who called himself [[Chief Buffalo Child Long Lance]] became associated with the museum shortly after the war ended.&lt;ref name=Weaver/&gt;{{rp|84}} 

From 1956 to 1984, the museum in Radebul was called the "Indianer Museum", because May's books were suppressed by the East German government, in part because of the association with the Nazis, but also because the books were viewed as leading people to want to travel, which the government did not allow.&lt;ref name=NY&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galchen|first1=Rivka|title=Wild West Germany|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/04/09/wild-west-germany|work=The New Yorker|date=2 April 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Cold War]] placards in the museum in Radebeul and its displays were refactored to describe oppression of Native Americans by the US, as part of Soviet [[propaganda]] efforts to rally indigenous people against the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tóth|first1=György Ferenc|title=From Wounded Knee to Checkpoint Charlie: The Alliance for Sovereignty between American Indians and Central Europeans in the Late Cold War|date=2016|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9781438461236|pages=128ff|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fGwJDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some East Germans also did work with the [[American Indian Movement]].&lt;ref name=NY/&gt; 
[[File:Karl May Museum Skalp.jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.5|Scalp exhibited at the museum]]
The museum in Radebul was given its original name again in 1986, as the East German government moved to reclaim May. The renaming led to an exhibition focused on May in February, which had 4,000 visitors a day, and people waited for three hours outside to get in.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;  After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, attendance at the Radebul museum dropped from around 300,000 people per year to around 60,000, as people could travel to the US instead of visiting the museum, which had been one of the only sources of information about Native Americans in East Germany.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt; 

In 2010, according to the ''South China Morning Post'', US activists began seeking [[repatriation]] of the scalps.&lt;ref name=SCMP&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1446600/karl-may-museum-under-fire-over-display-native-american-scalps | work= South China Morning Post | title= Karl May Museum under fire over display of Native American scalps |date= 11 March 2014 | accessdate= 3 May 2018 |quote= For four years, United States activists have been calling for the return of the scalps. The display of scalps has been banned in the US since 1990.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin-based journalist Mark Worth brought the scalps to the attention of Karen Little Coyote of the [[Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes]], who wrote a letter asking for the scalps to be returned in the fall of 2013.&lt;ref name=WildWest&gt;{{cite news |author= Knight, Ben |url= http://www.dw.de/wild-west-museum-in-row-over-native-american-scalps/a-17498259 |title= Wild West museum in row over Native American scalps | date = 10 March 2014 |work=Deutsche Welle |accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the German Museums Association issued a guideline on the care of human remains, listing scalps from peoples who "fashioned trophies from the heads of their killed enemies" as an exception to "human remains acquired in a context of injustice".&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  In March 2014, Cecil E. Pavlat, who works on return of artifacts for the [[Sault Ste.

The director of the museum in Radebul from 1985 to 2014 was René Wagner; Christian Wacker was appointed director in 2018.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Radebeul: Christian Wacker wird Direktor im Karl-May-Museum|url=https://www.mdr.de/kultur/karl-may-museum-radebeul-christian-wacker-100.html|work=Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk|date=January 11, 2018|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1013">'''Lamberto II da Polenta''' (died 1347) was briefly jointly lord of [[Ravenna]] and [[Cervia]] from 1346 until his death.

He was the son of [[Ostasio I da Polenta]]. In 1346 he inherited the family lordships together with his brothers [[Bernardino I da Polenta|Bernardino I]] and [[Pandolfo da Polenta|Pandolfo]]. Bernardino, however, had both Pandolfo and Lamberto imprisoned in Cervia after one year, where they died of starvation.

Bon Vivant did not have adequate records and controls of production lots and distribution in order to trace the products quickly. The company also did not have the finances or manpower necessary to run a successful recall program. As a result, the FDA had to seize all the Bon Vivant soup throughout the country, more than a million cans in all. FDA said the seizure occupied 125 man years of FDA time, enough for 2,000 ordinary factory inspections for preventive purposes. After some squabbling in the courts, where the owner of the company sought to recover the seized cans for resale under the company's new name, "Moore &amp; Co.," the soup was eventually incinerated, at the cost of nearly $150,000 to the federal government.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3428">The following is a list of notable proteins that are generated from [[recombinant DNA]], using [[biomolecular engineering]], focusing on those that are used in human and veterinary medicine. In many cases, recombinant human proteins have replaced the original animal-derived version used in medicine. The prefix "rh" for "recombinant human" appears less and less in the literature. 

A much larger number of recombinant proteins is used in the research laboratory. These include both commercially available proteins (for example most of the enzymes used in the molecular biology laboratory), and those that are generated in the course specific research projects.

==Human recombinants that largely replaced animal or harvested from human types==
* [[Growth hormone|Human growth hormone]] ([[rHGH]]): [[Humatrope]] from [[Eli Lilly and Company|Lilly]] and [[Serostim]] from [[Serono]] replaced [[cadaver]] harvested human growth hormone
* [[Insulin|human insulin]] (BHI): [[Humulin]] from Lilly and [[Novolin (disambiguation)|Novolin]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; from [[Novo Nordisk]] among others largely replaced bovine and porcine insulin for human therapy.  Some prefer to continue using the animal-sourced preparations, as there is some evidence that synthetic insulin varieties are more likely to induce [[Diabetic hypoglycemia#Hypoglycemic_unawareness|hypoglycemia unawareness]]. Remaining manufacturers of highly purified animal-sourced insulin include the U.K.'s Wockhardt Ltd. (headquartered in India), Argentina's Laboratorios Beta S.A., and China's Wanbang Biopharma Co.
* [[Follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) as a recombinant [[gonadotropin preparation]] replaced Serono's [[Pergonal]] which was previously isolated from post-menopausal female urine
* [[Factor VIII]]: [[Kogenate]] from [[Bayer]] replaced [[blood]] harvested factor VIII

==Human recombinants with recombination as only source==
* [[Erythropoietin]] (EPO): [[Epogen]] from [[Amgen]]
* [[Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]] (G-CSF): [[filgrastim]] sold as Neupogen from Amgen; [[pegfilgrastim]] sold as Neulasta
* [[alpha-galactosidase | alpha-galactosidase A]]: [[Fabrazyme]] by [[Genzyme]]
* [[alpha-L-iduronidase]]: (rhIDU; laronidase) [[Aldurazyme]] by [[BioMarin Pharmaceutical]] and Genzyme
* [[N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase]] (rhASB; galsulfase):  [[Naglazyme]] by BioMarin Pharmaceutical

{{nihilism}}
'''Mereological nihilism''' (also called '''compositional nihilism''', or rarely simply [[nihilism]]) is the [[mereology|mereological]] position that [[Object (philosophy)|object]]s with proper parts do not exist.  Only mereological simples, those basic building blocks without [[proper part]]s, exist. Or, more succinctly, "nothing is a proper part of anything".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Explanation==
The concepts of parts and wholes are used to describe common objects. For example, a ball is made up of two halves, so the ball is a whole that is made up of two parts. Every single object we experience in the world outside of us and around us is a whole that has parts, and we never experience an object that does not have parts. For example, a tail is a part of a lion, a cloud is a part of a greater weather system or, in visual terms, the sky, and a nucleobase is a part of a DNA strand. The only things we know of that do not have parts are the smallest items known to exist, such as [[leptons]] and [[quarks]]. These fundamental particles cannot be 'seen' and are not directly experienced. They may, however, be experienced indirectly through emergent properties.  Thus all objects we directly experience have parts. 

A number of philosophers have argued that objects that have parts do not exist. The basis of their argument consists in claiming that our [[sense]]s give us only foggy information about [[reality]] and thus they cannot be trusted. For example, we fail to see the smallest building blocks that make up anything.  These smallest building blocks are individual and separate items that do not ever unify or come together into being non-individual. Thus, they never compose anything. According to the concept of mereological nihilism, if the building blocks of reality never compose any wholes, then no composite objects exist.

This seems to devolve into an error theory. If there are no composite objects, how can we make sense of our ordinary understanding of reality which accepts the existence of composite objects?  Are we all deceived?  Ted Sider (2013) has argued that we should think of composition as arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;Sider, Theodore (2013). Against Parthood. Oxford Studies in Metaphysics 8:237–293.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sider, when we say "there is a table", we mean there are mereological simples arranged table-wise.

==Discussion==
Mereological nihilism entails the denial of what is called classical [[mereology]], which is succinctly defined by philosopher [[Achille Varzi (philosopher)|Achille Varzi]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mereology/ Mereology], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mereology (from the Greek μερος, 'part') is the theory of parthood relations: of the relations of part to whole and the relations of part to part within a whole. Its roots can be traced back to the early days of philosophy, beginning with the [[atomism|Presocratic atomists]] and continuing throughout the writings of [[Plato]] (especially the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'' and the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''), [[Aristotle]] (especially the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', but also the ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', the ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]'', and ''[[Parts of Animals|De partibus animalium]]''), and [[Boethius]] (especially ''In Ciceronis Topica'').&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As can be seen from Varzi's passage, classical mereology depends on the idea that there are [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] relations that connect part(s) to whole. Mereological nihilists maintain that such relations between part and whole do not exist, since "wholes" themselves only exist at the subatomic level.

Nihilists typically claim that our senses give us the (false) impression that there are composite material objects, and then attempt to explain why nonetheless our thought and talk about such objects is 'close enough' to the truth to be innocuous and reasonable in most conversational contexts.{{fact|date=July 2014}}  Sider's linguistic revision that reformulates the existence of composite objects as merely the existence of arrangements of mereological simples is an example of this.&lt;ref&gt;Sider, Theodore (2013). Against Parthood. Oxford Studies in Metaphysics 8:237–293.&lt;/ref&gt; Tallant (2013) has argued against this maneuver.  Tallant has argued that mereological nihilism is committed to answering the following question: when is it that a group of mereological simples is arranged in a particular way?&lt;ref&gt;Tallant, Jonathan (2013). Against mereological nihilism. Synthese 191 (7):1511-1527.&lt;/ref&gt; What relations must maintain among a group of mereological simples such that they are arranged table-wise?  It seems the nihilist can determine when a group of objects compose another object: for them, never. But the nihilist, if he is committed to Sider's view, is committed to answering how mereological simples can be arranged in particular ways.  No compelling answer has been provided in the literature.  Mereological nihilism seems to pose the same amount of questions as it purports to answer.  In fact, they are the very same questions re-formed in terms of arrangement.

===Objections===
The obvious objection that can be raised against nihilism is that it seems to posit far fewer objects than we typically think exist. The nihilist's ontology has been criticized for being too sparse as it only includes mereological simples and denies the existence of composite objects that we intuitively take to exist, like tables, planets, and animals. Another challenge that nihilists face arises when composition is examined in the context of contemporary physics. According to findings in quantum physics, there are multiple kinds of decomposition in different physical contexts. For example, there is no single decomposition of light; light can be said to be either composed of particles or waves depending on the context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Healy|first1=Richard|title=Physical Composition|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|date=2013|volume=44|pages=48-62}}&lt;/ref&gt; This empirical perspective poses a problem for nihilism because it does not look like material objects neatly decompose in the way nihilists imagine they do. In addition, some philosophers have speculated that there may not be a "bottom level" of reality. Atoms used to be understood as the most fundamental material objects, but were later discovered to be composed of subatomic particles and quarks. Perhaps what we take to be the most fundamental entities of current physics can actually be decomposed, and their parts can be further decomposed, on down the line. If matter is infinitely decomposable in this respect, then there are no mereological simples. This is a problem for nihilism because it then follows from their view that nothing exists, since they assert that only mereological simples exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ney|first1=Alyssa|title=Metaphysics: An Introduction|publisher=Routledge|pages=111-112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partial vs. pure nihilism===
Philosophers in favor of something close to pure mereological nihilism are [[Peter Unger]], Cian Dorr, and Ross Cameron. There are a few philosophers who argue for what could be considered a partial nihilism, or what has been called quasi-nihilism, which is the position that only objects of a certain kind have parts.  One such position is [[organicism]]: the view that living beings exist, but there are no other objects with parts, and all other objects that we believe to be composite—chairs, planets, etc.—therefore do not exist. Rather, other than living beings, which are composites (objects that have parts), there are only true atoms, or basic building blocks (which they call simples). The organicists include [[Trenton Merricks]] and [[Peter van Inwagen]].

====Van Inwagen's view====
Peter Van Inwagen maintains that all material objects are mereological simples with the exception of biological life such that the only composite objects are living things. Van Inwagen's view can be formulated like this: "Necessarily, for any non-overlapping xs, there is an object composed of the xs iff either (i) the activities of the xs constitute a life or (ii) there is only one of the xs."In other words, Van Inwagen contends that mereological atoms form a composite object when they engage in a sort special, complex activity which amounts to a life. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ned Markosian|authorlink1=Restricted Composition|editor1=Sider|editor2=Hawthorne|editor3=Zimmerman|title=Contemporary Debates in Metaphysics|pages=341-363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One reason why Van Inwagen's solution to the Special Composition Question is so attractive is that it allows us to account a conscious subject as a composite object. Nihilists have to maintain that the subject of a single consciousness is somehow the product of many discrete mereological atoms. Van Inwagen's argument against nihilism can be characterized as such:

#I exist
#I am not a mereological simple
#At least one object exists that is not a mereological simple
#So, nihilism is false&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=ney|title=Metaphysics: An Introduction|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415640756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to allowing for the existence of trees, cats, and human beings, Van Inwagen's view is attractive because it inherits nihilism's elegant solutions to traditional problems in mereology like the Ship of Theseus and the problem of the many. 

One objection that can be offered against Van Inwagen's view is the vagueness of the category of life and the ambiguity of when something gets "caught up" in a life. For example, if a cat takes a breath and inhales a carbon atom, it is unclear at what point that atom becomes officially incorporated into the cat's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markosian|title=Restricted Composition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though there are no [[Table (furniture)|table]]s or [[chair]]s, van Inwagen thinks that it is still permissible to assert sentences such as 'there are tables'. This is because such a sentence can be paraphrased as 'there are simples arranged tablewise'; it is appropriate to assert it when there are simples arranged a certain way.  It is a common mistake to hold that van Inwagen's view is that tables are identical to simples arranged tablewise.  This is not his view: van Inwagen would reject the claim that tables are identical to simples arranged tablewise because he rejects the claim that composition is identity.  Nonetheless, he maintains that an ordinary speaker who asserts, for instance, "There are four chairs in that room" will speak truly if there are, indeed, simples in the room arranged in the appropriate way (so as to make up, in the ordinary view, four chairs).  He claims that the statement and its paraphrase "describe the same fact". Van Inwagen suggests an analogy with the motion of the sun: an ordinary speaker who asserts that "the sun has moved behind the elms" will still speak truly, even though we accept the Copernican claim that this is not, strictly speaking, literally true. (For details, see his book "Material Beings".)

''Psychological Bulletin, 135,'' 531-554.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, numerous scientific studies have shown that minority individuals experience a high degree of prejudice, which causes stress responses (e.g., high blood pressure, anxiety) that accrue over time, eventually leading to poor mental and physical health.&lt;ref name="Meyer, 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pascoe, 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dohrenwend, 2000"&gt;Dohrenwend, B.

New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Minority stress theory summarizes these scientific studies to explain how difficult social situations lead to [[chronic stress]] and poor health among minority individuals.  It is an important concept for psychologists and public health officials who seek to understand and reduce minority health disparities.

== Theoretical development ==
=== Emergence ===
Over the past three decades, social scientists have found that minority individuals suffer from mental and physical health disparities compared to their peers in majority groups.  This research has focused primarily on racial and sexual minorities.  For example, African Americans have been found to suffer elevated rates of [[hypertension]] compared to Whites.&lt;ref name="McNeilly"&gt;McNeilly, M., Anderson, N. B., Robinson, E. F., McManus, C.

Washington, DC: APA.&lt;/ref&gt; These health disparities impact day-to-day well-being as well as overall life expectancy, leading social scientists to ask: How can we reduce minority health disparities?  In order to answer this question, it was first important to explore the underlying causes of the disparities.

==== Social selection hypothesis ====
One causal explanation for minority health disparities is the social selection hypothesis, which holds that there is something inherent to being in a minority group (e.g., [[genetics]]) that makes individuals susceptible to health problems.&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;Bailey, J. M.  (1999).  [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/205342 Homosexuality and mental illness].  ''Archives of General Psychiatry, 56,'' 883-884.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dohrenwend, 1966"&gt;Dohrenwend, B. P.  (1966).  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2091276 Social status and psychological disorder: An issue of substance and an issue of method].  ''American Sociological Review, 31,'' 14-34.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, this view has not been supported by [[empirical]] research.  If minority individuals were genetically predisposed to poor health outcomes, the vast majority of them should face health disparities.  However, large-scale empirical studies have shown that most of LGB individuals do not suffer [[psychopathology]] and that many African Americans do not have heart disease.&lt;ref name="McNeilly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cochran &amp; Mays, 2009"&gt;Cochran, S. D., &amp; Mays, V. M. (2009).

''Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 118,'' 647-58.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, research suggests that environmental factors explain minority health disparities better than do genetic factors.&lt;ref name="Williams, 1994"&gt;Williams, D. R.  (1994). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1070005/pdf/hsresearch00053-0008.pdf The concept of race in Health Services Research: 1966 to 1990].

''American Journal of Public Health, 90,'' 1699–702.&lt;/ref&gt; While the social selection hypothesis is still debated, it is clear that genetic and dispositional factors do not fully explain the health disparities observed in minority groups.

==== Social causation hypothesis ====
A second hypothesis regarding the causes of minority health disparities suggests that minority group members face difficult social situations that lead to poor health.&lt;ref name="Dohrenwend, 1966"/&gt;  This hypothesis has received broad empirical support.&lt;ref name="Dohrenwend, 2000"/&gt;  Indeed, social psychologists have long  recognized that minority individuals have different social experiences compared to majority individuals, including prejudice and discrimination, unequal socioeconomic status, and limited access to health care.&lt;ref name="Allport"&gt;Allport, G. W.  (1954).  ''The nature of prejudice.''  New York: Anchor.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garnets"&gt;Garnets, L. D., Herek, G. M., &amp; Levy. B.  (1990).  [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/088626090005003010 Violence and victimization of lesbians and gay men: Mental health consequences].  ''Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 5,'' 366-383.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the social causation hypothesis, such difficult social experiences explain health differences between minority and majority individuals.&lt;ref name="Dohrenwend, 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dohrenwend, 2000"/&gt;

== Overview of minority stress theory ==
Minority stress theory extends the social causation hypothesis by suggesting that social situations do not lead directly to poor health for minority individuals, but that difficult social situations cause stress for minority individuals, which accrues over time, resulting in long-term health deficits.&lt;ref name="Meyer, 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyer, 2007"&gt;Meyer, I. H.  (2007). [http://eknygos.lsmuni.lt/springer/686/242-267.pdf Prejudice and discrimination as social stressors]. In I. H. Meyer and M. E. Northridge (Eds.), ''The Health of Sexual Minorities.'' Washington, DC: APA.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, minority stress theory distinguishes between distal and proximal stress processes.&lt;ref name="Dohrenwend, 2000"/&gt;  Distal stress processes are external to the minority individual, including experiences with rejection, prejudice, and discrimination.  Proximal stress processes are internal, and are often the byproduct of distal stressors; they include concealment of one’s minority identity, vigilance and anxiety about prejudice, and negative feelings about one’s own minority group.  Together, distal and proximal stressors accrue over time, leading to chronically high levels of stress that cause poor health outcomes. Thus, minority stress theory has three primary tenets: 

# Minority status leads to increased exposure to distal stressors.
# Minority status leads to increased exposure to proximal stressors, due to distal stressors.
# Minority individuals suffer adverse health outcomes, which are caused by exposure to proximal and distal stressors.

These three tenets of the minority stress theory have been tested in over 134 empirical studies, most of which examined racial and sexual minority populations.&lt;ref name="Pascoe, 2009"/&gt; Generally, the studies have confirmed that difficult social situations are associated with stress among minority individuals, and that minority stress helps to explain health disparities.

== Evidence of key concepts ==
=== Minority status and distal stressors ===

The first tenet of minority stress theory holds that being in a minority group is associated with increased exposure to distal stressors, such as prejudice and discrimination.  Indeed, despite significant improvement over the past several decades, numerous studies have confirmed that minority individuals continue to face high rates of distal stressors.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Williams, D. R.  (1999).

''Journal of Black Psychology, 22,'' 144-168.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rates of exposure to distal stressors are much higher among racial and sexual minorities than among majority individuals.  For example, LGB adults are twice as likely to recall experiencing prejudice throughout their lives compared to heterosexuals, and LGBT youth report significantly higher rates of prejudice and discrimination compared to their heterosexual peers.&lt;ref name="GLSEN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mays &amp; Cochran 2001"&gt;Mays, V.M., &amp; Cochran, S.D.

''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 73,'' 477-487.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing rates of perceived discrimination among African American and White individuals, researchers have found large differences in reports of discrimination: 30.9% of Whites reported experiencing "major discrimination" throughout their lives compared to 48.9% of African Americans.  Similarly, 3.4% of Whites reported experiencing discrimination "often" in their lives, compared to 24.8% of African Americans.&lt;ref name="Kessler"&gt;Kessler, R. C., Mickelson, K. D., &amp; Williams, D. R.  (1999).

''Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 40,'' 208-230.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, collectively, research suggests that minority individuals face frequent exposure to distal stressors compared to their majority group counterparts.&lt;ref name="Clark et al, 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;Bell, D.  (1992).  ''Faces at the bottom of the well: The permanence of racism.''  New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dovidio"&gt;Dovidio, J. F. and Gaertner, S.L. (Eds.) (1986) ''Prejudice, discrimination and racism.'' New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minority status and proximal stressors ===
Proximal stressors are internal processes that are presumed to occur following exposure to distal stressors.&lt;ref name="Dohrenwend, 2000"/&gt;  Examples of proximal stressors include fear of rejection, [[rumination (psychology)]] on previous experiences with prejudice, and distaste for one’s own minority group following a prejudice event.&lt;ref name="Meyer, 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyer, 2007"/&gt; Most research on this topic focuses on either sexual minorities or African Americans, and it is unclear whether the proximal stress processes are conceptually similar between these two groups.  Thus, it is necessary to review proximal stress processes separately for sexual minority and African American populations.

==== Proximal stressors among sexual minorities ====
A growing body of research indicates that exposure to distal stressors leads to proximal stressors in sexual minority populations. While sexual minority stress and gender minority stress both use Meyer's Minority Stress Model as a framework, and share some characteristics with gender minority stress, some researchers have suggested that sexual minority stress is distinct from the minority stress experienced by transgender, gender non-conforming, and non-binary-gender individuals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hendricks|first=Michael|date=2012|title=A conceptual framework for clinical work with transgender and gender nonconforming clients|url=|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|volume=43|pages=460–467|via=|doi=10.1037/a0029597}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74,'' 909-922.&lt;/ref&gt; Internalized [[homophobia]] is another proximal stressor prevalent among LGBT individuals.

In Herek, G. M. (Ed.) ''Stigma and sexual orientation: Understanding prejudice against lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals.''  Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, pp. 160-186.&lt;/ref&gt; As predicted by minority stress theory, internalized homophobia is associated with exposure to distal stressors, insofar as it only occurs because LGB individuals are exposed to negative societal attitudes toward same-sex attraction.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, J.  (1980).  Ego-dystonic homosexuality.  ''Comprehensive Psychology, 21,'' 119-127.&lt;/ref&gt; Rejection sensitivity represents a third proximal stress among sexual minority individuals.  [[Social rejection#Rejection sensitivity|Rejection sensitivity]] refers to chronic, anxious expectations of rejection based on one's stigmatized status.  Among sexual minority individuals, rejection sensitivity emerges from experiences of rejection from parents and is associated with internalized homophobia, unassertiveness, depression, and anxiety.&lt;ref name="Feinstein"&gt;Feinstein, Brian A., Marvin R. Goldfried, and Joanne Davila. "[http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2012-18970-001.html The relationship between experiences of discrimination and mental health among lesbians and gay men: An examination of internalized homonegativity and rejection sensitivity as potential mechanisms]."

Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 76, 306-317.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, previous experiences with prejudice are associated with proximal stress among LGB individuals, including concealment of their sexual identity, internalized homophobia, and rejection sensitivity.

==== Proximal stressors among African Americans ====
Among African Americans, proximal stressors were described by early social psychological theorists. For example, [[Erving Goffman]] observed that racial minorities approach social interactions with a high degree of anxiety, because they have been discriminated against in the past.&lt;ref name="Goffman"&gt;Goffman E. (1963). ''Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity.'' Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Gordon Allport]] asserted that African American individuals display vigilance after exposure to prejudice, actively scanning the social environment for potential threats.&lt;ref name="Allport"/&gt;  Such vigilance is presumed to be taxing, sapping emotional and cognitive energy from minority individuals and thus becoming stressful.  Proximal stressors also have been demonstrated among African Americans in terms of [[stereotype threat]].&lt;ref name="Steele"&gt;Steele, C. M.  (1997).  [http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/1997-04591-001.html A threat in the air: how stereotypes shape intellectual identity and performance].  ''The American Psychologist, 52,'' 613-629.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele 2"&gt;Steele, C. M., &amp; Aronson, J.  (1995).  Stereotype threat and the intellectual test performance of African Americans.  ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 69,'' 797-811.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have shown that, when African Americans are reminded of their racial minority status in an academic context, they face a high degree of anxiety, causing their intellectual performance to suffer.&lt;ref name="Steele 2"/&gt;

==== General proximal stressors among minority individuals ====
The proximal stress processes reviewed above are unique to specific minority groups; for example, internalized homophobia is a proximal stressor unique to LGBT individuals who experience prejudice about their sexual and or/gender orientation/expression, and vigilance against racism is unique to racial minorities who fear future experiences with race-based discrimination.  It is also possible that more general psychological processes act as proximal stressors for minority individuals.&lt;ref name="Hatz"&gt;Hatzenbuehler, M. L.  (2009).  How does sexual minority stigma "get under the skin"? A psychological mediation framework.  ''Psychological Bulletin, 135,'' 707-730.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, exposure to prejudice may lead to rumination, which is a common psychological phenomenon characterized by a maladaptive, repetitive, and obsessive focus on a past event that leads to depressive and anxious symptoms.&lt;ref name="N-H"&gt;Nolen-Hoeksema S.  (1991).  [http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/abn/100/4/569.html?uid=1992-12870-001 Responses to depression and their effects on the duration of depressive episodes].

''Perspectives on Psychological Science, 3,'' 400-424.&lt;/ref&gt; Several recent studies have shown that distal stressors are associated with such general proximal stress processes among minority individuals.  In one [[longitudinal study]], researchers found that gay men who experienced distal stressors related to their sexual orientation had an increased tendency to ruminate, which was associated with increased depressive and anxious symptoms compared to gay men who did not experience distal stressors.&lt;ref name="Hatz et al"&gt;Hatzenbuehler, M. L., Hilt, L. M., &amp; Nolen-Hoeksema, S. (2010).  [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lori_Hilt/publication/226440992_Gender_Sexual_Orientation_and_Vulnerability_to_Depression/links/00463538f2f977bc1e000000.pdf Gender, sexual orientation, and vulnerability to depression]. In Chrisler, J., &amp; McCreary, D. (Eds.) ''Handbook of Gender Research in Psychology.'' New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, LGBT youth reported higher rates of rumination on days when they experienced distal stressors; rumination in turn was associated with psychological distress.&lt;ref name="Hatz et al 2"&gt;Hatzenbuehler, M. L., Nolen-Hoeksema, S., &amp; Dovidio, J. F. (2009).  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3687354/ How does stigma "get under the skin?" The mediating role of emotion regulation]. ''Psychological Science, 20,'' 1282-1289.&lt;/ref&gt; Because minority individuals have been shown to face high rates of distal stressors compared to majority individuals, and because experiencing distal stressors is associated with general psychological stress processes such as rumination and anxiety, these findings highlight the more general ways in which prejudice and discrimination may affect internal stress processes among minority individuals.

=== Health outcomes ===

The bulk of minority stress research has examined the third tenet of the theory – namely, that distal and proximal stressors are associated with adverse health outcomes for minority individuals.  These outcomes include both mental and physical health disparities, which differ across minority groups.  Again, studies have yet to systematically determine whether minority stress is associated with different health outcomes among different minority groups.  Thus, it is necessary to review associations between minority stress and health separately for LGB, African American, and immigrant groups, as social scientists do not know whether stress causes similar outcomes across groups. The [[immigrant paradox]] outlines health outcomes among immigrant populations.

==== Health outcomes among sexual minorities ====
LGBT individuals face higher rates of psychopathology compared to their non-LGBT peers.  For example, population-based studies have shown that LGBT people are at risk for increased rates of substance abuse, suicide attempts, depression, and anxiety across the lifespan.&lt;ref name="Cochran &amp; Mays, 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cochran et al"&gt;Cochran, S.

Several studies have linked these negative health outcomes to distal stressors.  For example, in a national survey, LGBT adults displayed higher rates of psychiatric morbidity and also reported significantly higher rates of prejudice and discrimination compared to their heterosexual peers; prejudice and discrimination fully explained the link between sexual orientation and psychiatric symptoms for LGBT respondents.&lt;ref name="Mays &amp; Cochran 2001"/&gt; In another study, level of peer victimization partially explained associations between sexual orientation and suicide risk.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, S. T., &amp; Joyner, K.  (2001).  [https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdfplus/10.2105/AJPH.91.8.1276 Adolescent sexual orientation and suicide risk: Evidence from a national study].  ''American Journal of Public Health, 91,'' 1276-1281.&lt;/ref&gt; Perceived level of discrimination has also been shown to predict anxiety and substance abuse disorders among LGB individuals.&lt;ref name="Herek 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McKirnan"&gt;McKirnan, D.

''Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 97,'' 461-466.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Proximal stressors have also been linked to negative health outcomes for sexual minorities.  For example, internalized homophobia has been linked to [[self-harm]] and [[eating disorders]] as well as sexual risk-taking behavior.&lt;ref name="Meyer &amp; Dean"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williamson"&gt;Williamson, I. R.  (2000).  Internalized homophobia and health issues affecting lesbians and gay men.  ''Health Education Research, 15,'' 97-107.&lt;/ref&gt; Internalized homophobia has also been linked to general psychological distress, which predicts long-term mental health outcomes.&lt;ref name="Herek 2"/&gt; Thus, both distal and proximal social stressors are associated with negative mental health outcomes among sexual minorities.  Recent evidence suggests similar links between proximal stressors and physical health disparities in LGB communities, including cardiovascular disease, asthma, diabetes, and some cancers.&lt;ref name="Lick, Durso, &amp; Johnson"&gt;Lick, D. J., Durso, L. E., &amp; Johnson, K. L. (2013). Minority stress and physical health among sexual minorities. "Perspectives on Psychological Science, 8", 521-548.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Health outcomes among African Americans ====
[[Race and health in the United States#African-Americans|African Americans have been shown to suffer notable health disparities]] compared to their White peers.  For example, they suffer higher rates of morbidity due to [[stroke]], perinatal disease, and [[diabetes mellitus]] compared to Whites.&lt;ref name="CDC-1"&gt;U.S. Center for Disease Control.  (2004).  ''Health, United States, 2004.''  Hyattsville, MD: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/ref&gt; They also suffer high rates of colorectal, pancreatic, and stomach cancers.&lt;ref name="CDC-1"/&gt; In terms of mental health, African Americans report lower rates of overall [[life satisfaction]], as well as heightened depressive symptoms and substance abuse compared to Whites.&lt;ref name="Williams 1997"&gt;Williams, D. R., Yu, Y., Jackson, J. S., &amp; Anderson, N. B.  (1997).  [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/135910539700200305 Racial differences in physical and mental health: Socio-economic status, stress and disctimination].

Racism and mental health: The African American experience.  ''Ethnicity &amp; Health, 5,'' 243-268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Distal stressors have been linked to these health disparities among African Americans.  For example, one study showed that perceived prejudice was associated with irregular [[blood pressure]] throughout the day, which has been linked to long-term [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name="Brondolo"&gt;Brondolo, E., Libby, D. J., Denton, E., Thompson, S., Beatty, D. L., Schwartz, J., Sweeney, M., Tobin, J. N., Cassells, A., Pickering, T. G., and Gerin, W.  (2008).

(2003).  Effects of perceived racism and anger inhibition on ambulatory blood pressure in African Americans.  ''Psychosomatic Medicine, 65,'' 746-750.&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to racial prejudice has also been linked to negative health behaviors, such as [[smoking]] and [[substance abuse]], which are associated with poor cardiovascular health.&lt;ref name="L&amp;K"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;Bennett, G. G., Wolin, K. Y., Robinson, E. L., Fowler, S., &amp; Edwards, C. L.  (2005).  [http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdfplus/10.2105/AJPH.2004.037812 Perceived racial/ethnic harassment and tobacco use among African American young adults].  ''American Journal of Public Health, 95,'' 238-240.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, a recent meta analysis of 36 empirical studies revealed consistent effects of prejudice and discrimination on physical health (e.g., cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes) among racial minorities.&lt;ref name="Pascoe, 2009"/&gt;  That same review revealed that racial prejudice and discrimination were related to depressive symptoms and psychiatric distress in 110 empirical studies.&lt;ref name="Pascoe, 2009"/&gt; Individual studies have shown that reports of discrimination are associated with lower reports of happiness and life satisfaction, higher psychiatric distress, and depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name="Thompson, V"&gt;Thompson, V. L.  (1996).  Perceived experiences of racism as stressful life events.  ''Community Mental Health, 32,'' 223-233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson et al"&gt;Jackson, J. S., Brown, T. N., Williams, D. R., Torres, M., Sellers, S. L., &amp; Brown, K.  (1996).  Racism and the physical and mental health status of African Americans: A thirteen year national panel study.  ''Ethnicity and Disease, 6,'' 132-147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krieger"&gt;Krieger, N.  (1990).  Racial and gender discrimination: Risk factors for high blood pressure?  ''Social Science and Medicine, 30,'' 1273-1281.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, exposure to distal stressors has been linked to poor mental and physical health outcomes for African Americans. Poverty level affects mental health status. African Americans living below the poverty level, as compared to those over twice the poverty level, are 3 times more likely to report psychological distress.{{cn|date=September 2018}} African Americans are 20% more likely to report having serious psychological distress than Non-Hispanic Whites.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Other studies have linked proximal stressors and health outcomes for African Americans.  For example, researchers have found that African Americans have a sense of inferiority and low self-worth due to experiences with prejudice, which are associated with emotional distress.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;McCarthy, J. D., &amp; Yancey, W. L.  (1971).  Uncle Tom and Mr. Charlie: Metaphysical pathos in the study of racism and personal disorganization.  ''American Journal of Sociology, 76,'' 648-672.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, internalized racism has been linked to psychiatric symptoms, including high rates of alcohol consumption, low self-esteem, and depression.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor, J., &amp; Jackson, B.  (1990).  [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10826089009056228 Factors affecting alcohol consumption in black women, Part II].  ''The International Journal of Addictions, 25,'' 1415-1427.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor 2"&gt;Taylor, J., &amp; Jackson, B.  (1991).  [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00957984910181003 Evaluation of a holistic model of mental health symptoms in African American women].  ''The Journal of Black Psychology, 18,'' 19-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomes"&gt;Tomes, E., Brown, A., Semenya, K., &amp; Simpson, J.  (1990).  [https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/2134697 Depression in black women of low socioeconomic status: Psychological factors and nursing diagnosis].  ''Journal of National Black Nurses Association, 4,'' 37-46.&lt;/ref&gt; These findings corroborate the minority stress theory by demonstrating that proximal stressors are associated with health disparities among racial minorities. Non-Hispanic Whites are more than twice as likely to receive antidepressant prescription treatments as are Non-Hispanic Blacks. The death rate from suicide for African American men was almost four times that for African American women, in 2009. However, the suicide rate for African Americans is 60% lower than that of the Non-Hispanic White population. A report from the U.S. Surgeon General found that from 1980 - 1995, the suicide rate among African Americans ages 10 to 14 increased 233%, as compared to 120% of Non-Hispanic Whites.

== Criticism and limitations ==

Despite multiple studies indicating that minority individuals face a high degree of stress related to their minority identity, and that minority stress is associated with poor health outcomes, there are several methodological limitations and ongoing debates on this topic.

First, the minority stress concept has been criticized as focusing too narrowly on the negative experiences of minority individuals and ignoring the unique [[coping (psychology)|coping]] strategies and [[social support]] structures available to them.&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;Diamond, L. M.  (2003).  Integrating research on sexual-minority and heterosexual development: Theoretical and clinical implications. ''Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, 32,'' 490-498.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Savin-Williams"&gt;Savin-Williams, R. C.  (2008).  Then and now: recruitment, definition, diversity, and positive attributes of same-sex populations.  ''Developmental Psychology, 44,'' 135-138.&lt;/ref&gt; While theoretical writings about minority stress do note the importance of coping mechanisms for minority individuals,&lt;ref name="Meyer, 2003"/&gt; individual studies that use minority stress theory tend to focus on negative health outcomes rather than on coping mechanisms.  In the future, it will be important for researchers to consider both positive and negative aspects of minority group membership, examining whether and why one of those aspects outweighs the other in determining minority health outcomes.

Also, few studies have been able to test minority stress theory in full.  Most studies have examined one of the three links described above, demonstrating that minority individuals face heightened rates of prejudice, that minority individuals face health disparities, or that prejudice is related to health disparities.  Together, findings from these three areas corroborate minority stress theory, but a stronger test would examine all three parts in the same study.  While there have been a few such studies,&lt;ref name="Mays &amp; Cochran 2001"/&gt; further replication is necessary to support the presumed pathways underlying minority stress.

Most studies of minority stress are correlational.&lt;ref name="Pascoe, 2009"/&gt;  While these studies have the advantage of using large, national datasets to establish links between minority status, stressors, and health, they cannot demonstrate [[causality]].  That is, most of the existing research cannot prove that prejudice ''causes'' stress, which ''causes'' poor health outcomes among minority individuals, because [[correlation does not imply causation]].  One way to remedy this limitation is to employ experimental and longitudinal research designs to test the impact of social stressors on health.  Indeed, several recent studies have begun to use these more stringent tests of minority stress.&lt;ref name="Merritt"&gt;Merritt, M. M., Bennett, G. G., Jr., Williams, R. B., Edwards, C. L., &amp; Sollers, J. J., 3rd. (2006).  Perceived racism and cardiovascular reactivity and recovery to personally relevant stress. ''Health Psychology, 25,'' 364-369.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pavalko"&gt;Pavalko, E. K., Mossakowski, K. N., &amp; Hamilton, V. J.  (2003).  [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Krysia_Mossakowski/publication/10756618_Does_Perceived_Discrimination_Affect_Health_Longitudinal_Relationships_between_Work_Discrimination_and_Women%27s_Physical_and_Emotional_Health/links/5446d5380cf2f14fb811cbd7/Does-Perceived-Discrimination-Affect-Health-Longitudinal-Relationships-between-Work-Discrimination-and-Womens-Physical-and-Emotional-Health.pdf Does perceived discrimination affect health? Longitudinal relationships between work discrimination and women’s physical and emotional health]. ''Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 44,'' 18-33.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional studies are needed to confidently state that prejudice causes poor health for minority individuals.

Finally, it is unclear whether different minority groups face different types of minority stress and different health outcomes following prejudice.  Minority stress theory was originally developed to explain associations between social situations, stress, and health for LGB individuals.&lt;ref name="Meyer, 2003"/&gt; Still, researchers have used the same general theory to examine stress processes among African Americans, and findings have generally converged with those from LGB populations.  Thus, it is possible that minority stress applies broadly to members of diverse minority groups.  However, studies have yet to directly compare experiences, stress responses, and health outcomes among individuals from diverse minority groups.&lt;ref name="Pascoe, 2009"/&gt; Systematic comparisons are necessary to clarify whether minority stress applies to all minority individuals broadly, or whether different models are required for different groups.

== Practical applications ==

Minority stress research has demonstrated that several specific processes are associated with minority health disparities.  For example, existing studies highlight the differences between distal and proximal stressors, drawing attention both to socio-cultural factors (e.g., high rates of prejudice against minority individuals) and internal processes (e.g., rumination) that affect minority well-being.  By separating the socio-cultural and individual aspects of minority stress, the theory suggests that practical interventions must occur at both the individual and social levels.&lt;ref name="Meyer, 2007"/&gt;

=== Social applications ===
On the societal level, minority stress research shows that prejudice and discrimination are common occurrences for minority individuals, and that they have damaging effects for individual well-being.  This information has been used by law enforcement, policymakers, and social organizations to target and minimize the occurrence of distal stressors and, thus, to improve minority health on a large scale.&lt;ref name="Meyer, 2007"/&gt; For example, evidence that prejudice is associated with minority stress has been used in several [[amicus curiae]] briefs to settle important court cases regarding prejudice and discrimination against minority groups.&lt;ref name="AC 1"&gt;Brief for the NLF as Amicus Curiae, Perry v. Schwarzenegger and Hollingsworth, No. 10-16696 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AC 2"&gt;Brief for the USCA as Amicus Curiae, Log Cabin Republicans v. United States and Gates, No. 10-56634 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence that prejudice and discrimination are associated with minority stress that harms well-being for LGB individuals has also been invoked in the congressional debate about anti-harassment protection for LGB youth at the federal level.&lt;ref name="Meyer, 2007"/&gt; In the future, the minority stress concept can be used to advocate for federal funding for nationwide campaigns and interventions that aim to reduce intergroup prejudice.  If successful, these programs may reduce the rate of distal stressors, significantly improving the mental and physical health of minority individuals.

=== Individual applications ===
On the individual level, minority stress research has uncovered differences in how minorities react to prejudice.  For example, studies have shown that some individuals ruminate on experiences with prejudice, which is associated with anxiety and depression.&lt;ref name="Hatz et al"/&gt; Similarly, minority stress research has revealed that internalized stigma (i.e., distaste for one's own minority group) is associated with negative psychological outcomes.  From these findings, clinicians have developed some interventions to decrease internalized stigma and improve well-being for minority individuals.&lt;ref name="Meyer, 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crocker"&gt;Crocker, J., &amp; Major, B.  (1989).  [https://wesfiles.wesleyan.edu/courses/PSYC-309-clwilkins/week6/Crocker.Major1989.pdf Social stigma and self-esteem: The self-protective properties of stigma].  ''Psychological Review, 96,'' 608-630.&lt;/ref&gt;  When paired with structural interventions, these clinical applications for reducing minority stress may help to improve the pervasive health disparities observed in minority communities.&lt;ref name="Meyer, 2007"/&gt;

'''Mourning sickness''' is a [[collective]] [[emotional]] condition of "recreational [[grieving]]" by individuals in the wake of [[celebrity]] deaths and other [[collective trauma|public traumas]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sean|last=O'Neil|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1455117/Britain-wallowing-in-mourning-sickness.html|title=Britain 'wallowing in mourning sickness'|newspaper=Telegraph|date=2004-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such traumas may be linked to hyper-attentive, intrusive, and [[Voyeurism|voyeuristic]] media coverage, which has been dubbed '''grief porn'''.&lt;ref name=OB&gt;{{cite news | title=Boo hoo, said the crocodile | archivedate=2008-01-03| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103225710/http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/observer/archives/2005/04/07/boo_hoo_said_th.html|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/observer/archives/2005/04/07/boo_hoo_said_th.html | work=ObserverBlog | publisher=The Guardian | date= 2008-08-19| accessdate=2009-06-02 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Diana trafalgar square.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A misspelled "In memoriam" message of condolence at Trafalgar Square following Princess Diana's death]]
The history of mourning sickness in [[Great Britain]] can be traced to the public reaction to the [[Dunblane massacre]] in March 1996 when a lone assailant killed 16 schoolchildren and their teacher at the Dunblane Primary School in [[Scotland]], injuring 14 others. The [[Tragedy (event)|tragedy]] prompted a public reaction that brought a flood of flowers and sympathy cards from across Britain and even overseas from people unconnected to the victims of the tragedy or even the area where it happened.

A worldwide exhibit of mourning sickness, centred on Britain once again, following the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]] in 1997 when the Princess was killed in a car crash in [[Paris]]. Almost immediately following word of her death, makeshift [[memorials]] to Diana, who had been a hugely popular figure worldwide since her marriage to [[Prince Charles]] in 1981, began to pop up, most notably at her residence at [[Kensington Palace]]. The memorials became a gathering place for public [[Crying|weeping]] and for people to bring flowers.&lt;ref name=Merrin1999&gt;{{Cite journal

Similar displays of public grief occurred following the death in April 1998 of [[Linda McCartney]] (wife of former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[Paul McCartney]]), the murder of [[BBC]] journalist [[Jill Dando]] in April 1999, the murder of seven-year-old [[Surrey]] girl [[Murder of Sarah Payne|Sarah Payne]] in [[West Sussex]] in July 2000, and the murder of two 10-year-old girls from [[Soham murders|Soham]], [[Cambridgeshire]], in August 2002.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

==Anna Svidersky==
[[Image:Anna-Svidersky.gif|thumb|Logo and photo of Anna Svidersky from the memorial site, annasvidersky.net]]
The advent of the [[Internet]] added a new development in public mourning sickness that was displayed following the murder of American teenager [[Anna Svidersky]] in [[Vancouver, Washington]]. Svidersky was murdered while working at a [[McDonald's]] restaurant by [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] [[sex offender]] David Barton Sullivan. News of her death quickly spread worldwide, initially through the website [[Myspace|MySpace]], where she had a personal page, and then through other similar sites. This created an effect of mass grief and mourning for her around the world mostly from people who had previously known nothing about her.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;
{{cite news | first=Tim | last=Jonze | title=Death on MySpace | date=May 15, 2006 | publisher=The Guardian | accessdate=2006-05-23| url=http://technology.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1775013,00.html | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper compared the widespread expression of grief by strangers to that seen after the death of [[Princess Diana]]. The paper cited the 2004 [[Civitas (think tank)|Civitas]] think-tank, which described such grief as "mourning sickness", related to people's own emotional needs, rather than any real rapport with the deceased.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

==Criticism==
Some critics have described the public displays of mourning as "phony" and more for the benefit of the people grieving than for the victims, families or individuals that they are grieving for.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;"''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3512447.stm Mourning sickness is a religion]''" Feb 23rd. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The media plays a pivotal role in these displays, focusing attention on the public reaction to these events.&lt;ref&gt;F. Furedi ''"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20020825/ai_n12646008/pg_1 Mourning Sickness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121224847/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20020825/ai_n12646008/pg_1 |date=2008-01-21 }}"'' The Independent August 25th, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times|Times]]'' journalist [[Patrick West]] said in his booklet ''Conspicuous Compassion'' that "mourning sickness is a religion for the lonely crowd that no longer subscribes to orthodox churches. Its flowers and teddies are its rites, its collective minute's silences its liturgy and mass."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/grief-tourists-lap-up-other-peoples-pain-478357.html] Halley, Gwen, "Grief tourists lap up other people's pain." The Independent, Ireland, March 14, 2004. Retrieved August 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Journalist [[Rosie Boycott]] narrated an episode of [[Five (TV channel)|Five's]] ''Don't Get Me Started'' about mourning sickness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertybell.tv/content.aspx?page=56&amp;sub=100 Don't Get Me Started] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010162222/http://www.libertybell.tv/content.aspx?page=56&amp;sub=100 |date=2007-10-10 }}, Liberty Bell Productions&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media "grief porn"==
"Grief porn" is a [[pejorative]], [[neologism|neologistic]] expression usually used to describe the behavior of the news media in the wake of trauma. It is distinctly different from [[Schadenfreude]] in that it describes a forced or artificial commiseration in response to unfortunate events, whereas the latter refers to a joy at the misfortune of others. Commentators like Charlie Brooker have noted that the distinction can be blurred by the [[24-hour news cycle]] and its need to produce news stories.

Robert Yates, assistant editor for [[The Observer]], described some media coverage of deaths as producing "Gratification derived from a tenuous connection to the misfortunes of others; the gratuitous indulgence of tangential association with tragedy; getting off on really bad news". Yates was remarking on the phenomenon he first noticed following the death of [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] and the media frenzy that occurred afterwards. He reportedly observed an increase in activity during times of national mourning and international disaster, and commented dryly that it primarily affects people working in media.&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt;

Carol Sarler, writing as a guest columnist for ''[[The Times]]'', noted that "this new and peculiar pornography of grief" is sometimes called a 'tribute', "the cruder truth is that ersatz grief is now the new pornography; like the worst of hard-core, it is stimulus by proxy, voyeuristically piggy-backing upon that which might otherwise be deemed personal and private, for no better reason than frisson and the quickening of an otherwise jaded pulse.&lt;ref name="NewType"&gt;{{cite news | author=Carol Sarler | title=This new and peculiar pornography of grief | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article2402693.ece | work=Comment | publisher=TimesOnline | date=7 September 2007 | accessdate=2009-06-02 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Times'' online's [[Daniel Finkelstein]], called such coverage "a rather tasteless fascination with other people's disasters and a sentimentalism that is out of place".&lt;ref name="Finkelstein"&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Finkelstein |title=Can you solve the Madeleine McCann case? |url=http://timesonline.typepad.com/comment/2007/09/why-are-we-rive.html |work=Comment Central |publisher=Times Online |date= |accessdate=2009-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107111049/http://timesonline.typepad.com/comment/2007/09/why-are-we-rive.html |archivedate=2010-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not think this explained people's fascination with all deaths; using the example of  [[Disappearance of Madeleine McCann|Madeleine McCann]], a four-year-old child who went missing while on holiday with her parents, Finkelstein theorized that "we don't follow the McCann case because we are grief junkies. Most of us follow it because we fancy ourselves as [[Inspector Morse|(Inspector) Morse]]."&lt;ref name="Finkelstein"/&gt;

'''Angela Wrightson''' (1974/75 – 8 December 2014) was a British woman who lived in [[Hartlepool]], [[England]]. She was murdered by two teenage girls, who cannot be named for legal reasons, in her home&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-35977100 BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2014.

==Background==
Wrightson lived on Stephen Street in Hartlepool. She was an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]].

==Murder==
The second trial found that two girls, aged 13 and 14 at the time of the attack, murdered Wrightson in her home in a "sustained and brutal attack" on the night of 8 December 2014. She was found dead by her landlord the next morning.

Both girls were in the [[Children Act 1989|care system]] at the time.

==Legal proceedings==
The first trial was held in July 2015. However, due to widespread commentary on the case on social media networks including [[Facebook]], the judge [[Henry Globe]] ordered that the trial be abandoned as the case could be prejudiced. This led to [[Publication ban|reporting restrictions]] under the [[Children and Young Persons Act 1933|Children and Young Persons Act of 1933]].

Between the first and second trials, media organisations challenged the reporting restrictions in the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/05/angela-wrightson-two-teenage-girls-found-guilty&lt;/ref&gt;

The second trial was held from February to April 2016 at [[Leeds Crown Court]]. Two teenage girls were convicted of the murder and sentenced to a minimum of 15 years' imprisonment on 7 April.

Sentencing, the judge ruled that the anonymity of the two perpetrators should be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;Courts and Tribunals Judiciary https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sentence-f-d.pdf (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pain compliance''' is the use of painful stimulus to control or direct a person or animal. The stimulus can be manual (brute force, placing pressure on painful areas, or use of painful [[hyperextension]] or [[hyperflexion]] on joints),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iALDssswVjMC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=pain+compliance&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=beBCVbnhKJLRggTGwIBo&amp;ved=0CDgQ6wEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=pain%20compliance&amp;f=false | title=USMC Martial Arts Gray Belt Instructor Manual | accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; use tools such as a [[whip]] or [[electroshock weapon]], or use chemicals such as [[tear gas]] or [[pepper spray]].

The purpose of pain compliance is to direct the actions of the subject, and to this end, the pain is lessened or removed when compliance is achieved. This provides incentive to the subject to carry out the action required.

==Use in humans==
The most common use in humans is as a law enforcement technique to assist with taking a suspect in to custody, control a suspect in custody or encourage action on behalf of a person who is passively resisting. In disciplined law enforcement, the use of pain compliance forms part of a [[use of force continuum]] which will usually start with verbal warnings, before escalating measures.

The pain stimulus can be manual, using a [[pain compliance hold]] or can be through the use of weapons such as an [[electroshock weapon]] (Taser). Pain compliance as part of an escalation of force policy normally presumes a rational adversary, but some altered states such as [[mental illness]], [[phencyclidine]] and [[amphetamine]] use, or extreme [[adrenaline]] may alter the subject's perception of pain or willingness to submit.

Like other forms of [[non-lethal force]], such pain compliance strategies are not perfect and may be abused as a form of [[torture]], with [[plausible deniability]]. For this reason the use of pain compliance is often subject to explicit [[rules of engagement]] designed to prevent abuse and avoid [[conflict escalation]].

==Use in animals==
Pain compliance is used as a training aid in animals, with physical aids including the use of [[whip]]s and [[shock collar]]s.

After MacRae walked back down to the basement where Gallant was sitting at the computer, he hit her in the back of her head with a two-by-four wood board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estateofdenial.com/2011/06/08/macrae-gets-nothing-from-slain-wife%E2%80%99s-estate-nova-scotia/ |title=MacRae gets nothing from slain wife’s estate (Nova Scotia) – Estate of Denial |publisher=Estateofdenial.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then proceeded to strangle her to the floor until she stopped moving and then wrapped her head with [[Saran Wrap]] to make sure she was dead.

==Early life and education==
Gallant was a grade three teacher at Beechville Lakeside Timberlea School. Gallant was actively involved in her school and community, and art was one of her passions. She was pursuing her Certificate in Visual Arts at [[NSCAD]].

==Disappearance==
On December 27, 2005, shortly after 7:00PM her husband had contacted his wife's sister Lana Kenny to see if she knew of her whereabouts. At their house 45 minutes later MacRae contacted the Halifax Regional Police reporting that Gallant had not returned from Costco, since 2:00PM.

==Searches==
Family and friends searched the community and called friends and neighbors trying to locate Gallant. At 12:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.  on December 28, 2005, Gallant's car was located at the Beachville-Lakeside-Timberlea School where she teaches a Grade 3 art class. The car was locked and her body was found in the trunk of her green 1997 Chevrolet Cavalier. She was wrapped in a blanket in a fetal position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Metro |first=Staff |url=http://metronews.ca/news/200015/statement-of-facts-in-macrae-murder-case/ |title=Statement of facts in MacRae murder case |publisher=Metronews.ca |date=2011-03-02 |accessdate=2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
Gallant's murder was covered locally and nationally throughout Canada. The family and MacRae were interviewed and profiled by ''[[The National (CBC)|The National]]'' and ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV)|The Fifth Estate]]'', in 2006.&lt;ref name="scribd1"/&gt; Her death was one of Nova Scotia's most high-profile unsolved homicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ns/news-nouvelles/releases-communiques/Aug1810_133158-eng.htm |title=Charges laid in Paula Gallant Homicide - Update, Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM), N.S. - Royal Canadian Mounted Police |publisher=Rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=2010-08-18 |accessdate=2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PricePointGraph.svg|Price points A, B, and C, along a [[demand curve]] (where P is price and Q represents demand)|framed]]

'''Price points''' are [[price]]s at which [[demand]] for a given [[Product (business)|product]] is supposed to stay relatively high.

==Characteristics==
Introductory [[microeconomics]] depicts a [[demand curve]] as downward-sloping to the right and either linear or gently convex to the origin. The downwards slope generally holds, but the model of the curve is only [[piecewise]] true, as price surveys indicate that demand for a product is not a [[linear function]] of its price and not even a [[smooth function]]. Demand curves resemble a series of waves rather than a straight line. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The diagram shows price points at the points labeled A, B, and C. When a vendor increases a price beyond a price point (say to a price slightly above ''price point B''), sales volume decreases by an amount more than proportional to the price increase. This decrease in quantity-demanded more than offsets the additional revenue from the increased unit-price. As a result, total revenue (price multiplied by quantity-demanded) decreases when a firm raises its price beyond a price point. Technically, the [[price elasticity of demand]] is low (inelastic) at a price lower than the price point (steep section of the demand curve), and  high (elastic) at a price higher than a price point (gently sloping part of the demand curve). [[Business entity|Firm]]s commonly set prices at existing price-points as a [[marketing strategy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Causes==
There are three main reasons for price points to appear:

# [[Consumer theory#Price effect as sum of substitution and income effects|Substitution]] price points
#* price points occur at the price of a close substitute
#* when an item's price rises above the cost of a close substitute, the quantity demanded drops sharply{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
# [[Customary pricing|Customary price]] points
#* the [[Market (economics)|market]] grows accustomed to paying a certain amount for a type of product
#* increasing the price beyond this amount will cause sales to drop dramatically{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
# Perceptual price points (also referred to as "[[psychological pricing]]" or as "odd-number pricing")
#* raising a price above 99 cents will cause demand to fall disproportionately because people perceive $1.00 as a significantly higher price&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Increased Consumer Sales Response Through Use of 99-Ending Prices|last = Schindler|first = Robert M.|date = 1996|journal = Journal of Retailing|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Kibarian|first2 = Thomas M.|volume = 72|issue = 2|pages = 187–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oligopoly pricing==
In relation to customary price points, [[oligopolies]] can also generate price points. Such price points do not necessarily result from  [[collusion]], but as an [[emergence|emergent]] property of oligopolies: when all firms sell at the same price, any firm which attempts to raise its selling price will experience a decrease in sales and revenues (preventing firms from raising prices unilaterally); on the other hand, any firm in an oligopoly which lowers its prices will mostly likely be matched by competitors, resulting in small increases in sales but decreases in revenues (for all the firms in that market). This effect can potentially produce a kinked demand-curve where the kink lies at the point of the current price-level in the market.
These results depend on the elasticity of the demand curve{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} and on the properties of each market.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20189">{{main article|Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy}}
The '''conspiracy theories relating to the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy''', a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] and brother of [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassinated]] President [[John F. Kennedy]], relate to non-standard accounts of the assassination that took place shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, in Los Angeles, California. [[Robert F. Kennedy]] was [[Robert F. Kennedy assassination|assassinated]] during celebrations following his successful campaign in the Californian [[primary election]]s while seeking the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination for U.S. President.

The perpetrator was a 24-year-old [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[Immigration|immigrant]] named [[Sirhan Sirhan]], who remains incarcerated for the crime. However, as with his brother's death, Robert Kennedy's assassination and the circumstances surrounding it have spawned various [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], particularly regarding the existence of a second gunman.&lt;ref name=cnnMartinez&gt;{{cite news|last=Martinez|first=Michael|title=RFK assassination witness tells CNN: There was a second shooter|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/28/justice/california-rfk-second-gun|publisher=CNN|date=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such theories have also centered on a woman wearing a polka-dot dress claiming responsibility for the crime, and the involvement of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. Many of these theories were examined during an investigation ordered by the [[United States Senate]] and were judged to be erroneous by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], which investigated on the Senate's behalf.

==Second gunman theory==
[[File:Rkennedy01.jpg|thumb|left|Robert Kennedy campaigns in Los Angeles (photo by [[Evan Freed]]).]]
The location of Kennedy's wounds suggested that his assailant had stood behind him, but witnesses said that Sirhan stood facing west, about a yard away from Kennedy, as he moved through the pantry facing east.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/feb/22/kennedy.assassination| title=New evidence challenges official picture of Kennedy shooting |date=2008-02-22 |accessdate=2008-04-28|publisher=''The Guardian''|first=James |last=Randerson}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the suggestion that a second gunman actually fired the fatal shot, a possibility supported by Chief [[Medical Examiner]]-[[Coroner]] for the [[County of Los Angeles]] [[Thomas Noguchi]], who stated that the fatal shot was behind Kennedy's right ear and had been fired at a distance of approximately one inch.&lt;ref name="NoguchiBook"&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas|last=Noguchi|title=Coroner|year=1985|location=New York|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn= 978-0-671-46772-2|authorlink=Thomas Noguchi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other witnesses said that as Sirhan approached, Kennedy was turning to his left shaking hands, facing north and so exposing his right side.&lt;ref name=FBISum1b&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foia.fbi.gov/rfkasumm/rfksumm1b.pdf|title=Robert F. Kennedy Assassination Summary, Part 1(b), p. 35|accessdate=2008-07-25|format=[[PDF]]|publisher=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt; As recently as 2008, eyewitness [[John Pilger]] asserted that there must have been a second gunman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i1.democracynow.org/2008/6/5/democracy_now_special_robert_f_kennedy|title=Democracy Now! Special: Robert F. Kennedy's Life and Legacy 40 Years After His Assassination|publisher=democracynow.org|accessdate=2008-07-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709174530/http://i1.democracynow.org/2008/6/5/democracy_now_special_robert_f_kennedy|archivedate=2008-07-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 14th, 1975, the [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors]] appointed Thomas F. Kranz as Special Counsel to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office to investigate the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=18723|title=George Bush: Nomination of Thomas F. Kranz To Be an Associate Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency|website=Presidency.ucsb.edu|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion of the experts was that there was little or no evidence to support this theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vault.fbi.gov/Robert%20F%20Kennedy%20%28Assassination%29%20 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522145835/https://vault.fbi.gov/Robert%20F%20Kennedy%20%28Assassination%29%20/ |archivedate=2017-05-22 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FBISum1b /&gt;

Sirhan's .22-caliber [[Iver-Johnson]] Cadet revolver contained eight rounds, which were all fired. Since the assassination took place in a tight, confined pantry, all bullets became embedded in the walls, the ceiling and the victims. Three bullets hit Kennedy; two stayed in his body and another tore through his arm. The five bullets that hit the other five victims stayed in their bodies, leaving two bullets that would have been lodged in the room itself. The [[LAPD]] found three bullet holes in the foam ceiling, and concluded that a bullet must have ricocheted through the ceiling before turning back and hitting a person. This explanation had a major flaw: there were two bullet holes in the door frame to the pantry. The LAPD does not acknowledge this, but the press took photos of the bullet holes showing police personnel pointing at them and measuring them. Martin Patrusky, a hotel waiter, remembered being told by officers that they had removed two bullets from the door frame. But the LAPD removed the door frame and the ceiling tiles and later incinerated them.{{Citation needed|reason=Unreferenced paragraph|date=June 2018}}

In 2007, analysis of an audio recording&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rfkmustdie.blip.tv/file/1362352 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203161347/http://rfkmustdie.blip.tv/file/1362352/ |archivedate=2009-02-03 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; of the shooting made that night by freelance reporter Stanislaw Pruszynski appeared to indicate, according to forensic expert Philip van Praag, that at least 13 shots were fired.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt; Van Praag also said the recording revealed at least two instances in which the time between shots was shorter than humanly possible. According to Van Praag, the firing of more than eight shots was independently corroborated by forensic audio specialists Wes Dooley and Paul Pegas of Audio Engineering Associates, forensic audio and ballistics expert Eddy B. Brixen,{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and audio specialist Phil Spencer Whitehead of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/international/2009/06/08/bs.rfkennedy.audio.johnson.cnn?iref=videosearch|title=Video News - CNN|website=CNN|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other acoustic experts, through their own independent analyses, have stated that no more than eight shots are recorded on the audio tape.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, P. (2007) 'Analysis of "The Pruszynski Tape"' (report on recording of gunshots). In Ayton, M., ''The Forgotten Terrorist: Sirhan Sirhan and the Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy.'' Washington: Potomac Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 26, 2011, Sirhan's defense attorneys [[William Francis Pepper|William F. Pepper]] and Laurie Dusek filed a 62-page brief in federal court asserting that a bullet used as evidence to convict Sirhan was switched with another bullet at the crime scene. The brief claims that this was done because the bullet taken from Kennedy's neck did not match Sirhan's gun. Pepper and Dusek claim that the new evidence is sufficient to find Sirhan not guilty under the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/lawyers-bullet-switched-sirhans-trial-231726566.html|title=Linda Deutsch (Associated Press) 2011-11-29|website=News.yahoo.com|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The security guard as second gunman theory==
Thane Eugene Cesar has frequently been cited as the most likely candidate for a second gunman.&lt;ref name="kranzp3"&gt;Kranz, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Cesar had been employed by Ace Guard Service to protect Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel. This was not his full-time job; during the day he worked as a maintenance plumber at the Lockheed Aircraft plant in Burbank, a job that required security clearance from the Department of Defense. He worked there from 1966 until losing his job in 1971. Author [[Dan Moldea]] wrote that in 1973 Cesar began working at Hughes, a job he held for seven years and which Cesar said required the second-highest clearance level at the plant.&lt;ref&gt;Moldea,  pp. 200–01.&lt;/ref&gt;

When interviewed, Cesar stated that he did draw a gun at the scene of the shooting, but insisted the weapon was a Rohm .38, not a .22, the caliber of the bullets found in Kennedy. He also said he got knocked down after the first shot and was unable to fire his gun. The LAPD, which interviewed Cesar shortly after the shooting, did not regard him as a suspect and did not ask to see his gun.&lt;ref&gt;Moldea, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Cesar stated that he did own a .22-caliber [[Harrington &amp; Richardson]] pistol, and he showed it to LAPD sergeant P. E. O'Steen on June 24, 1968.&lt;ref name="Moldea, pp. 151-52"&gt;Moldea, pp. 151–52.&lt;/ref&gt; But when the LAPD interviewed Cesar three years later, he claimed that he had sold the gun before the assassination to a man named Jim Yoder. William W. Turner tracked down Yoder in October 1972. Yoder still had the receipt for the H &amp; R pistol, which was dated September 6, 1968, and bore Cesar's signature, indicating that Cesar had sold the pistol three months after Kennedy's assassination, contradicting his 1971 claim that he had sold the weapon months before it.&lt;ref name="Moldea, pp. 151-52"/&gt; Moldea wrote that Cesar submitted years later to a polygraph examination performed by Edward Gelb, former president and executive director of the American Polygraph Association, in which Cesar denied any involvement in the assassination, and passed with flying colors.&lt;ref&gt;Moldea, pp. 280–290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manchurian candidate hypothesis==

Another conspiracy theory relates to a [[Manchurian candidate]] hypothesis, that Sirhan was psychologically programmed by persons unknown to commit the murder, that he was not aware of his actions at the time and that his mind was "wiped" in the aftermath by the conspirators so that he would have no memory of the event or of the people who "programmed" him.&lt;ref name=kranzp50&gt;Kranz, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was supported by psychologist and hypnosis expert Dr. Eduard Simson-Kallas after 35 hours of work with Sirhan in San Quentin prison in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Turner |first1=William W. |last2=Christian |first2=Jonn G. |title=The assassination of Robert F. Kennedy: a searching look at the conspiracy and cover-up, 1968–1978 |page=199 |year=1978 |publisher=Random House |isbn= 978-0-394-40273-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sirhan claimed then, and has continued to claim, to have no memory of the assassination or its aftermath.

==The woman in a polka-dot dress==
Some of the witnesses stated that they observed a woman in a [[polka dot|polka-dot]] dress in various locations throughout the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] before and after the assassination.&lt;ref name="History News Network; May 7, 2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/38496 |title=The Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy and the Girl in the Polka Dot Dress |last=Ayton |first=Mel |date=May 7, 2007 |website=historynewsnetwork.org |publisher=History News Network |access-date=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One witness, Kennedy campaign worker Sandra Serrano, reported that around 11:30 p.m. she was sitting outside on a stairway that led to the Embassy Ballroom when a woman and two men, one of whom Serrano later stated was Sirhan, walked past her up the stairs.&lt;ref name="History News Network; May 7, 2007"/&gt; Serrano said that around 30 minutes later, she heard noises that sounded like the [[back-fire|backfire]] of an automobile, then saw the woman and one of the men running from the scene.&lt;ref name="History News Network; May 7, 2007"/&gt; She stated that the woman exclaimed, "We shot him, we shot him!"&lt;ref name="History News Network; May 7, 2007"/&gt; According to Serrano, when she asked the woman to whom she referred, the woman said "Senator Kennedy."&lt;ref name="History News Network; May 7, 2007"/&gt; A visibly frazzled Serrano related her account to NBC's [[Sander Vanocur]] soon after the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Alternative News &amp; Info Report|title=RFK Assassination: The Girl In The Polka Dot Dress (Part 1 of 3)|date=2009-01-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoRG5cMrfIk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m18s|accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another witness, [[Evan Freed]], also saw the girl in the polka-dot dress.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Blair Kaiser. "R. F. K. must die!": A history of the Robert Kennedy assassination and its aftermath.

In 1974, retired LAPD officer Paul Sharaga told a newsman with [[KMPC]] in Los Angeles that as he was responding to the shooting in the hotel, an elderly couple reported to him that they saw a couple in their early 20s, one of whom was a woman in a polka-dot dress. The couple were smiling and shouting "We shot him... we killed Kennedy... we shot him... we killed him". Sharaga also stated that he filed official reports of the incident, but that they disappeared and were never investigated.&lt;ref name="Santa Monica Evening Outlook; December 23, 1974"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Young Pair Shouted 'We Killed Kennedy' |url=https://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=99650#relPageId=237 |work=Santa Monica Evening Outlook |location=Santa Monica, California |date=December 23, 1974 |agency=UPI |access-date=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="York Daily Record; December 23, 1974"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Report in Robert Kennedy's Slaying Ignored |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/81355665/ |work=York Daily Record |location=York, Pennsylvania |date=December 23, 1974 |page=15 |agency=UPI |access-date=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CIA involvement==
In November 2006, [[BBC Television]]'s ''[[Newsnight]]'' aired a 12-minute screening of [[Shane O'Sullivan (filmmaker)|Shane O'Sullivan]]'s documentary ''[[RFK Must Die]]''.&lt;ref name="OSullivanGuardian"&gt;{{cite news |title=Did the CIA kill Bobby Kennedy? |work=The Guardian |date=2006-11-20 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,1952379,00.html |last=O'Sullivan |first=Shane |accessdate=2006-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aaronovitch"&gt;{{cite book |last=Aaronovitch |first=David |author-link=David Aaronovitch |date=2010 |chapter=Conclusion: Bedtime Story |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=0t7lC3nmFq8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT265#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Voodoo Histories: The Role of the Conspiracy Theory in Shaping Modern History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0t7lC3nmFq8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Riverhead Books |page= |isbn=9781101185216 |access-date=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Sullivan stated that while researching a screenplay based on the [[Robert F.

Several people who had known Morales, including family members, were adamant that he was not the man whom O'Sullivan claimed was Morales.&lt;ref name="Aaronovitch"/&gt; After O'Sullivan published his book, assassination researchers Jefferson Morley and [[David Talbot]] discovered that Campbell had died of a [[heart attack]] in 1962, six years before the assassination.&lt;ref name="Aaronovitch"/&gt; In response, O'Sullivan stated that the man on the video may have used Campbell's name as an alias.&lt;ref name="Aaronovitch"/&gt; He then took his identifications to the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], whose files showed the men he identified as Campbell and Joannides to be Michael Roman and Frank Owens, two [[Bulova]] sales managers attending the company's convention at the Ambassador.&lt;ref name="Aaronovitch"/&gt; O'Sullivan stood by his allegations, stating that the Bulova watch company was a "well-known CIA cover".&lt;ref name="Aaronovitch"/&gt;

'''School violence''' encompasses physical violence, including student-on-student fighting and [[corporal punishment]]; [[Psychological abuse|psychological violence]], including verbal abuse; [[sexual violence]], including rape and sexual harassment; many forms of [[bullying]], including [[cyberbullying]]; and carrying weapons in school.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002469/246970e.pdf|title=School Violence and Bullying: Global Status Report|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100197-0|location=|pages=9, 110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely held to have become a serious problem in recent decades in many countries, especially where weapons such as guns or knives are involved. It includes [[violence]] between school students as well as  physical attacks by students on school staff.

==Risk factors==

===Internalizing and externalizing behaviors===

A distinction is made between internalizing and externalizing behavior. Internalizing behaviors reflect withdrawal, inhibition, anxiety, and/or [[depression (mood)|depression]]. Internalizing behavior has been found in some cases of youth violence although in some youth, depression is associated with substance abuse. Because they rarely act out, students with internalizing problems are often overlooked by school personnel.&lt;ref name="Christie"&gt;Christie, C.A., Nelson, C.M., &amp; Jolivet, K. (2005). [http://www.edjj.org/focus/prevention/plr.pdf ''Prevention of antisocial and violent behavior in youth: A review of the literature''.] Lexington, KY: University of Kentucky. Retrieved 2009-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Externalizing behaviors refer to delinquent activities, aggression, and hyperactivity. Unlike internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors include, or are directly linked to, violent episodes. Violent behaviors such as punching and kicking are often learned from observing others.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1983). Psychological mechanisms of aggression. In R. G. Geen &amp; E. I. Donnerstein (Eds.), ''Aggression: Theoretical and empirical reviews''. New York: Academic. {{ISBN|0-12-278801-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="akers"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akers | first1 = R.

===Other individual factors===

A number of other individual factors are associated with higher levels of aggressiveness. Compared to children whose antisocial conduct begins in adolescence, early starters have a worse prognosis in terms of future aggression and other antisocial activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0954579498001734 | last1 = Patterson | first1 = G.

===Home environment===
The home environment is thought to contribute to school violence. The Constitutional Rights Foundation suggests long-term exposure to [[gun]] violence, parental [[alcoholism]], [[domestic violence]], physical abuse of the child, and child sexual abuse teaches children that criminal and violent activities are acceptable.&lt;ref name="CRE"&gt;Constitutional Rights Foundation. (1997). [http://www.crf-usa.org/school-violence/causes-of-school-violence.html  ''Causes of school violence'']. Retrieved on April 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Harsh parental discipline is associated with higher levels of aggressiveness in youth.&lt;ref name="Sampson"/&gt; There is some evidence indicating that exposure to [[television violence]]&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, B.

Straus adduced evidence for the view that exposure to parental [[Corporal punishment in the home|corporal punishment]] increases the risk of aggressive conduct in children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1525/sp.1991.38.2.03a00010 | last1 = Straus | first1 = M.

Gerald Patterson's social interactional model, which involves the mother's application and the child's counterapplication of ''coercive'' behaviors, also explains the development of aggressive conduct in the child.&lt;ref name="Patterson"&gt;Patterson, G. (1982). ''Coercive family process''. Eugene, OR: Castalia. {{ISBN|0-916154-02-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, G. R. (1995). Coercion as a basis for early age of onset for arrest. In J. McCord (Ed.), ''Coercion and punishment in long-term perspectives'' (pp. 81–105). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, coercive behaviors include behaviors that are ordinarily punishing (e.g., whining, yelling, hitting, etc.). Abusive home environments can inhibit the growth of social cognitive skills needed, for example, to understand the intentions of others.&lt;ref name="CRE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dodge, Pettit"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0021-843X.104.4.632 | last1 = Dodge | first1 = K.

===Neighbourhood environment===
Neighbourhoods and communities provide the context for school violence.  Communities with high rates of crime and drug use teach youth the violent behaviors that are carried into schools.&lt;ref name="CRE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.59.2.77 | last1 = Evans | first1 = G.

==Prevention and intervention==
The goal of prevention and intervention strategies is to stop school violence from occurring. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], there are at least four levels at which violence-prevention programs can act: at the level of society in general, the school community, the family, and the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2006). [https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/duip/spotlite/SafeYouthSafeSchools.htm School health policies and programs study]. Retrieved on April 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Society-level prevention strategies'' aim to change social and cultural conditions in order to reduce violence regardless of where the violence occurs. Examples include reducing [[media violence research|media violence]], reshaping social [[norm (sociology)|norms]], and restructuring [[education|educational systems]].&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.[https://www.cdc.gov/HealthyYouth/shpps/2006/factsheets/pdf/FS_ViolencePrevention_SHPP2006.pdf/ "School Health Policies and Programs Study 2006"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 2008. Retrieved April 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The strategies are rarely used and difficult to implement.
**Now Is The Time is a federal initiative developed in 2013 in response to the growing number of gun related school violence incidents. The initiative will provide funding and resources to schools in an effort to reduce gun violence in schools. Funding will be provided for implementation of school interventions and training teachers and staff, programs that will support the mental and physical health of students, conflict resolution programs to reduce further school violence, and restoration of school environment after a violent incident.&lt;ref&gt;Examining School Safety and Gun Violence in America.

**The implementation of ''school-wide early-warning systems'', the school equivalent of a [[Distant Early Warning Line|DEW Line]]-like surveillance operation designed to "prevent the worst cases of school violence," has been problematic.&lt;ref name="Schon"/&gt; Recent developments in early threat assessment, however, show promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/15388220.2010.519432 | pmid = | title = Development, Evaluation, and Future Directions of the Virginia Student Threat Assessment Guidelines | year = 2011 | last1 = Cornell | first1 = Dewey | last2 = Allen | first2 = Korrie | journal = [[Journal of School Violence]] | volume = 10 | pages = 88–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence-prevention efforts can also be usefully directed at developing anti-bullying programs, helping teachers with classroom-management strategies, applying behavioral strategies such as the Good Behavior Game, implementing curricular innovations such as the Second Step syllabus, developing programs to strengthen families (see below), and implementing programs aimed at enhancing the social and academic skills of at-risk students (see below).
* Teachers are the professional group who works directly where school bullying takes place and who spends the most time with both bullies, victims and bystanders. Thus, whether and how teachers intervene in the case of bullying is of great importance. Research has shown that teachers prefer authority-based interventions towards bullies but seem to neglect to support the victims.&lt;ref name="Burger 2015 191–202"&gt;{{cite journal| last       = Burger| first      = Christoph| last2      = Strohmeier| first2     = Dagmar| last3      = Spröber| first3     = Nina| last4      = Bauman| first4     = Sheri| last5      = Rigby| first5     = Ken| date       = 2015| title      = How teachers respond to school bullying: An examination of self-reported intervention strategy use, moderator effects, and concurrent use of multiple strategies.| url        = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tate.2015.07.004| journal    = Teaching and Teacher Education |volume=51| pages      = 191–202| doi        = 10.1016/j.tate.2015.07.004

== Challenges in measuring violence in schools ==
Research on violence affecting children in schools is challenging for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Methodological issues ===
When trying to measure the scope of violence in schools and to find out about the types of violence experienced by students, some key issues include: from what categories of the school community to collect the data; what data should be collected from each categories; and using which methods. For example, should there be studies or surveys where researchers ask students directly about violence in school, through self-reports about the violence they experienced as targets or perpetrators? Or should they be asked about incidents of violence that they have witnessed as bystanders? Should any of these questions be asked via self-administered questionnaires or questionnaires administered by researchers in schools? Does it make more sense to collect this data outside of schools, for example, through household surveys? Or through online surveys where students have access to the internet? Or is it better to rely on mechanisms for reporting incidents of violence in educational institutions when they are available, either in the schools themselves or outside schools (governmental hotlines, internet-based reporting systems, police and justice sectors, etc.)? What questions can be asked of children, using terminology that is easy to understand, age-appropriate and culturally sensitive?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Legal and ethical issues ===
In most countries there are strict rules related to research involving children, as they are under the age of consent. Therefore, requesting informed consent from the children in a study involves their parents and guardians. Asking children about violence, and particularly violence they have experienced themselves, can be traumatic. Finally, researching [[Education and the LGBT community|issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity/orientation in education]] and in relation to children has additional challenges. In some contexts it is not legal to discuss these issues either in schools or even outside of schools. Where it is legal, it may be considered as a very sensitive topic to be discussed with children and young people. Asking children and young people questions related to their sexual orientation and gender identity in the school setting is ethically questionable, as it could embarrass them and expose them to stigma and discrimination, unless questions are asked in strict confidence and anonymity is granted by independent researchers external to schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15702">In [[computer science]], '''separation of concerns''' ('''SoC''') is a design principle for separating a [[computer program]] into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate [[concern (computer science)|concern]]. A concern is a set of information that affects the code of a computer program. A concern can be as general as the details of the hardware the code is being optimized for, or as specific as the name of a class to instantiate. A program that embodies SoC well is called a [[modularity (programming)|modular]]&lt;ref name=laplante&gt;{{cite book|last=Laplante|first=Phillip|title=What Every Engineer Should Know About Software Engineering|year=2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0849372283|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFHYk0KWAEgC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=%22separation+of+concerns%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WQ_aUNn5DYjNiwLS54GADQ&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22separation%20of%20concerns%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; program. Modularity, and hence separation of concerns, is achieved by [[Encapsulation (computer science)|encapsulating]] information inside a section of code that has a well-defined interface. Encapsulation is a means of [[information hiding]].&lt;ref name=mitchell&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Dr. R. J.|title=Managing Complexity in Software Engineering|year=1990|publisher=IEE|isbn=0863411711|pages=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uXtHeZt8ZowC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22separation+of+concerns%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WQ_aUNn5DYjNiwLS54GADQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22separation%20of%20concerns%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Layered designs in information systems are another embodiment of separation of concerns (e.g., presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer, persistence layer).&lt;ref name=microsoft&gt;{{cite book|title=Microsoft Application Architecture Guide|year=2009|publisher=Microsoft Press|isbn=0-7356-2710-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9on897Ep7AC&amp;pg=PT54&amp;dq=%22separation+of+concerns%22+%22layered+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0xPaUKKJMITmiwKhiYDYCA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of separation of concerns is simplifying development and maintenance of computer programs. When concerns are well-separated, individual sections can be reused, as well as developed and updated independently. Of special value is the ability to later improve or modify one section of code without having to know the details of other sections, and without having to make corresponding changes to those sections.

== Implementation ==
The mechanisms for modular or object-oriented programming that are provided by a [[programming language]] are mechanisms that allow developers to provide SoC.&lt;ref name=richard&gt;{{cite paper|last=Painter|first=Robert Richard|title=Software Plans: Multi-Dimensional Fine-Grained Separation of Concerns|citeseerx = 10.1.1.110.9227|publisher=Penn State}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[object-oriented programming]] languages such as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[C++]], [[Delphi programming language|Delphi]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] can separate concerns into [[Object (computer science)|objects]], and architectural [[Design pattern (computer science)|design patterns]] like [[Model-view-controller|MVC]] or [[Model-view-presenter|MVP]] can [[separation of presentation and content|separate content from presentation]] and the data-processing (model) from content.
[[Service-orientation|Service-oriented design]] can separate concerns into [[Service (Systems Architecture)|services]]. [[Procedural programming]] languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] can separate concerns into [[procedure (computer science)|procedure]]s or [[Subroutines|functions]]. [[Aspect-oriented programming]] languages can separate concerns into [[aspect (computer science)|aspects]] and [[Object (computer science)|objects]].

Separation of concerns is an important design principle in many other areas as well, such as [[urban planning]], [[architecture]] and [[information design]].&lt;ref name=garofalo&gt;{{cite book|last=Garofalo|first=Raffaele|title=Building Enterprise Applications with Windows Presentation Foundation and the Model View ViewModel Pattern|year=2011|publisher=Microsoft Press|isbn=0735650926|pages=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6WJ5oQT0dcUC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22separation+of+concerns%22+%22urban+planning%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CxjaUK-hN-yVjAKz84D4Cg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22separation%20of%20concerns%22%20%22urban%20planning%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to more effectively understand, design, and manage complex interdependent systems, so that functions can be reused, optimized independently of other functions, and insulated from the potential failure of other functions.

Common examples include separating a space into rooms, so that activity in one room does not affect people in other rooms, and keeping the stove on one circuit and the lights on another, so that overload by the stove does not turn the lights off. The example with rooms shows encapsulation, where information inside one room, such as how messy it is, is not available to the other rooms, except through the interface, which is the door. The example with circuits demonstrates that activity inside one module, which is a circuit with consumers of electricity attached, does not affect activity in a different module, so each module is not concerned with what happens in the other.

== Origin ==
The term ''separation of concerns'' was probably coined by [[Edsger W. Dijkstra]] in his 1974 paper "On the role of scientific thought".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

{{quote |Let me try to explain to you, what to my taste is characteristic for all intelligent thinking. It is, that one is willing to study in depth an aspect of one's subject matter in isolation for the sake of its own consistency, all the time knowing that one is occupying oneself only with one of the aspects. We know that a program must be correct and we can study it from that viewpoint only; we also know that it should be efficient and we can study its efficiency on another day, so to speak. In another mood we may ask ourselves whether, and if so: why, the program is desirable. But nothing is gained&amp;nbsp;—on the contrary!— by tackling these various aspects simultaneously. It is what I sometimes have called '''"the separation of concerns"''', which, even if not perfectly possible, is yet the only available technique for effective ordering of one's thoughts, that I know of. This is what I mean by "focusing one's attention upon some aspect": it does not mean ignoring the other aspects, it is just doing justice to the fact that from this aspect's point of view, the other is irrelevant. It is being one- and multiple-track minded simultaneously.}}

Fifteen years later, it was evident the term '''Separation of Concerns''' was becoming an accepted idea. In 1989, Chris Reade wrote a book titled "Elements of Functional Programming"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Reade | first = Chris | authorlink = Chris Reade | title = Elements of Functional Programming
  | publisher = Addison-Wesley Longman | year = 1989 | location =  Boston, MA, USA | isbn = 0-201-12915-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; that describes separation of concerns:
{{quote |The programmer is having to do several things at the same time, namely,
# describe what is to be computed;
# organise the computation sequencing into small steps;
# organise memory management during the computation.}}
Reade continues to say,
{{quote |Ideally, the programmer should be able to concentrate on the first of the three tasks (describing what is to be computed) without being distracted by the other two, more administrative, tasks. Clearly, administration is important, but by separating it from the main task we are likely to get more reliable results and we can ease the programming problem by automating much of the administration.

The '''separation of concerns''' has other advantages as well. For example, program proving becomes much more feasible when details of sequencing and memory management are absent from the program. Furthermore, descriptions of what is to be computed should be free of such detailed step-by-step descriptions of how to do it, if they are to be evaluated with different machine architectures. Sequences of small changes to a data object held in a store may be an inappropriate description of how to compute something when a highly parallel machine is being used with thousands of processors distributed throughout the machine and local rather than global storage facilities.

Automating the administrative aspects means that the language implementor has to deal with them, but he/she has far more opportunity to make use of very different computation mechanisms with different machine architectures.}}

== Examples ==

=== Internet protocol stack ===
Separation of concerns is crucial to the design of the Internet. In the [[Internet Protocol Suite]], great efforts have been made to separate concerns into well-defined [[OSI Model|layers]]. This allows protocol designers to focus on the concerns in one layer, and ignore the other layers. The Application Layer protocol SMTP, for example, is concerned about all the details of conducting an email session over a reliable transport service (usually TCP), but not in the least concerned about how the transport service makes that service reliable. Similarly, TCP is not concerned about the routing of data packets, which is handled at the [[Internet Layer]].

=== HTML, CSS, JavaScript ===
[[HTML|HyperText Markup Language]] (HTML), [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS), and [[JavaScript]] (JS) are complementary languages used in the development of webpages and websites. HTML is mainly used for organization of webpage content, CSS is used for definition of content presentation style, and JS defines how the content interacts and behaves with the user. Historically, this was not the case: prior to the introduction of CSS, HTML performed both duties of defining semantics and style.

=== Subject-oriented programming ===
[[Subject-oriented programming]] allows separate concerns to be addressed as separate software constructs, each on an equal footing with the others. Each concern provides its own class-structure into which the objects in common are organized, and contributes state and methods to the composite result where they cut across one another. Correspondence rules describe how the classes and methods in the various concerns are related to each other at points where they interact, allowing composite behavior for a method to be derived from several concerns. [[Subject-oriented programming#Multi-Dimensional Separation of Concerns, Hyper/J and the Concern Manipulation Environment|Multi-dimensional Separation of Concerns]] allows the analysis and composition of concerns to be manipulated as a multi-dimensional "matrix" in which each concern provides a dimension in which different points of choice are enumerated, with the cells of the matrix occupied by the appropriate software artifacts.

=== Aspect-oriented programming ===
[[Aspect-oriented programming]] allows [[cross-cutting concern]]s to be addressed as primary concerns. For example, most programs require some form of [[computer security|security]] and [[Data logging|logging]]. Security and logging are often secondary concerns, whereas the primary concern is often on accomplishing business goals. However, when designing a program, its security must be built into the design from the beginning instead of being treated as a secondary concern. Applying security afterwards often results in an insufficient security model that leaves too many gaps for future attacks. This may be solved with aspect-oriented programming. For example, an aspect may be written to enforce that calls to a certain API are always logged, or that errors are always logged when an exception is thrown, regardless of whether the program's procedural code handles the exception or propagates it.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software build automation ===
Most project organization tasks are seen as secondary tasks. For example, [[build automation]] is an approach to automating the process of compiling source code into binary code. The primary goals in build automation are reducing the risk of human error and saving time.

=== Levels of analysis in artificial intelligence ===
In [[cognitive science]] and [[artificial intelligence]], it is common to refer to David Marr's [[David Marr (neuroscientist)#Levels_of_analysis|levels of analysis]].  At any given time, a researcher may be focusing on (1) what some aspect of intelligence needs to compute, (2) what algorithm it employs, or (3) how that algorithm is implemented in hardware.  This separation of concerns is similar to the [[interface (computing)|interface]]/implementation distinction in software and hardware engineering.

=== Normalized Systems ===

In [[Normalized Systems]] separation of concerns is one of the four guiding principles. Adhering to this principle is one of the tools that helps reduce the combinatorial effects that, over time, get introduced in software that is being maintained. In Normalized Systems separation of concerns is actively supported by the tools.

=== SoC via partial classes ===
Separation of concerns can be implemented and enforced via [[partial class]]es.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Shakhid Raduyevich Baysayev''' ({{lang-ru|Шахид Радуевич Байсаев}}; 1939–2000) was a [[Chechen people|Chechen]] [[civilian]] who was [[forced disappearance|forcibly disappeared]] (and presumably [[summary execution|summarily executed]]) after being detained by [[Russia]]n special police forces on the outskirts of [[Grozny]], [[Chechnya]] on 2 March 2000. His body was never found.

==Biography==
Shakhid Baysayev was born in 1939 in Podgornoye, a [[suburb]] of Grozny in the [[Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]. In 2000 he worked as an [[auto mechanic]] at a local company; he was married with five children.

==Disappearance==
In the morning of March 2, 2002, the Russian [[OMON]] paramilitary police forces, who just suffered significant casualties from a [[Grozny OMON fratricide incident|notorious friendly fire incident]] in this neighbourhood of Grozny, conducted a search operation for suspected rebel fighters who were blamed for the incident. Baysayev was [[Detention (imprisonment)|detained]] on his way to work; a witness described him as being in pain and his appearance suggested that he had been beaten. Russian troops filmed the detention themselves and later sold the videotape to his wife, Asmart Baysayeva, for $1,000; the video showing Baysayev lying on the ground and being kicked by a soldier before being taken away. She was also given a sketched map purportedly showing where her husband was buried; at the site, she found a fragment of cloth that looked like it came from his coat.

==Investigation==
After the detention of her husband, Baysayeva immediately complained to the authorities. Despite her continued efforts and the existence of the [[footage]] of the detention, however, the Russian authorities failed to carry out an effective investigation,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} prompting Baysayeva to turn to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR). On April 5, 2007, in the ruling in the case [[Baysayeva v. Russia]], the European Court ruled that Baysayev's detention was unlawful and that he must be presumed dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srji.org/en/news/2007/04/29/ European Court of Human Rights condemns Russia on Chechen disappearance case]&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also found it "astonishing" that the servicemen depicted in the video, who were unmasked, have still not been identified by the official investigation.

'''''Stambovsky v. Ackley''''', [[Case citation|169]] A.D.2d 254 ([[N.Y. App. Div.]] 1991), commonly known as the '''''Ghostbusters'' ruling''', is a case in the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division]], that held that a house, which the owner had previously advertised to the public as [[haunted house|haunted]] by [[ghost]]s, legally was haunted for the purpose of an action for [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] brought by a subsequent purchaser of the house. Because of its unique holding, the case has been frequently printed in textbooks on [[contracts]] and [[property|property law]] and widely taught in [[law school in the United States|U.S. law school]] classes, and is often cited by other courts.

==Facts and prior history==
During the course of her ownership of the [[real property|property]] at issue, which was located in [[Nyack, New York]], Helen Ackley and members of her family had reported the existence of numerous [[poltergeist]]s in the house.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghosttheory.com/2015/09/03/the-haunted-house-on-the-hudson|title=The Haunted House On The Hudson {{!}} Ghost Theory|last=Giamarie|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ackley had reported the existence of ghosts in the house to both ''[[Reader's Digest]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Helen Herdman Ackley|title= Our Haunted House on the Hudson|magazine=Reader's Digest|date= May 1977|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a local newspaper on three occasions between 1977 and 1989, when the house was included on a five-home walking tour of the city. She recounted to the press several instances in which the poltergeists interacted directly with members of her family. She claimed that grandchildren received "gifts" of baby rings, all of which suddenly disappeared later. She also claimed that one ghost would wake her daughter, Cynthia each morning by shaking her bed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ktransit.com/Kavanagh/Ghost/ghost-update.htm|title=Ghost of Nyack: Update|website=www.ktransit.com|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed that when spring break arrived Cynthia proclaimed loudly that she did not have to wake up early and she would like to sleep in; her bed did not shake the next morning.

Neither Ackley nor her real estate broker, Ellis Realty, revealed the haunting to Jeffrey Stambovsky before he entered a contract to purchase the house in 1989 or 1990. Stambovsky made a $32,500 downpayment on the agreed price of $650,000 for the house.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/20/nyregion/phones-ringing-eerily-for-nyack-spook-home.html|title=Phones Ringing (Eerily?) For Nyack Spook Home|last=Barron|first=James|date=1990-03-20|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stambovsky was from [[New York City]] and was not aware of the folklore of Nyack, including the widely known haunting story.

When Stambovsky learned of the haunting story, he filed an action requesting rescission of the contract of sale and for [[damages]] for [[fraud|fraudulent misrepresentation]] by Ackley and Ellis Realty. Stambovsky did not attend the [[closing (real estate)|closing]] which caused him to forfeit the downpayment (although he was then not obligated to buy the house).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  A [[New York Supreme Court]] (trial court) dismissed the action, and Stambovsky appealed.

==The case==

===Majority opinion===
Near the beginning of the majority opinion (three out of five justices) appears its most well-known conclusion: "having reported [the ghosts'] presence in both a national publication... and the local press... defendant is [[estopped]] to deny their existence and, as a matter of law, the house is haunted." The court noted that regardless of whether the house was truly haunted or not, the fact that the house had been widely reported as being haunted greatly affected its value.

Notwithstanding these conclusions, the court affirmed the dismissal of the fraudulent misrepresentation action and stated that the realtor was under no duty to disclose the haunting to potential buyers. Thus, no damages were available to Stambovsky because New York, at the time, adhered to property law doctrine of ''[[caveat emptor]]''.

The appellate court reversed the trial court's decision regarding the rescission action, however, as it went on to note that "haunting" was not a condition that a buyer or potential buyer of real property can and should be able to ascertain upon reasonable inspection of the property. According to the court, though the doctrine of ''caveat emptor'' would normally operate to bar a rescission action, causing seller to have no duty to disclose information about the property to be sold (but also preventing the seller from affirmatively misrepresenting the condition of the property), the doctrine, in a merged law and [[Equity (law)|equity]] system, can be modified to do justice to the parties. In this case, "the most meticulous inspection and the search would not reveal the presence of poltergeists at the premises or unearth the property's ghoulish reputation in the community," thus equity would allow Stambovsky the remedy of contract rescission against the seller, Ackley. The court held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Where, as here, the seller not only takes unfair advantage of the buyer's ignorance but has created and perpetuated a condition about which he is unlikely to even inquire, enforcement of the contract (in whole or in part) is offensive to the court's sense of equity. Application of the remedy of rescission, within the bounds of the narrow exception to the doctrine of caveat emptor set forth herein, is entirely appropriate to relieve the unwitting purchaser from the consequences of a most unnatural bargain.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The opinion makes reference to a number of popular books and films featuring ghosts, including [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Hamlet]]'' and the 1984 movie ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' and uses supernatural idioms throughout (e.g., "plaintiff hasn't a ghost of a chance", "I am moved by the [[spirit]] of equity", and "the notion [...] is a [[hobgoblin]] which should be exorcised from the body of legal precedent").

===Dissenting opinion===
The [[dissenting opinion]] argued that the doctrine of ''[[caveat emptor]]'' should be strictly applied and would affirm the trial court's dismissal of all of the actions. Displeased by the majority's basis for its holding, the dissent said, "Finally, if the doctrine of caveat emptor is to be discarded, it should be for a reason more substantive than a poltergeist. The existence of a poltergeist is no more binding upon the defendants than it is upon this court."

==Epilogue==
The case generated considerable publicity and area real estate agents had between 25 and 50 potential buyers calling within a week of the court's decision.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Among the  prospective buyers to the house at 1 LaVeta Place on the [[Hudson River]] was [[Kreskin]]. Kreskin was a renowned mentalist interested in purchasing a haunted home in which to curate his collection of paranormal paraphernalia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ackley sold the house to another buyer and moved to Florida in 1991. Helen Ackley died in 2003 and her son-in-law "lays odds" that her spirit has taken up residence back at 1 Ackley Place.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There have not been public reports of hauntings in recent years.

== Ghost Stories ==
The house had been vacant and was in disrepair when the Ackleys moved into the waterfront home in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ktransit.com/Kavanagh/Ghost/ghost-background.htm|title=Ghost of Nyack: Background|website=www.ktransit.com|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local children purportedly warned them that the house was haunted, though no prior paranormal incidents appear to have been published.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Helen Ackley claimed there were at least three ghosts in the residence. She described two as a married couple who lived in the 18th century, and the other as a Navy Lieutenant in the American Revolution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In 1993 she was contacted by paranormal researcher Bill Merrill, and medium Glenn Johnson who claimed to have already made contact with two of the spirits at 1 LaVeta Place. The pair met with Helen and disclosed that the couple were likely the poltergeists of Sir George and Lady Margaret who lived in the region in the 18th century. In 1995 Merrill and Johnson published a book about their findings entitled ''Sir George, The Ghost of Nyack'' (Deer Publishing, Beaverton, Oregon) – still available on Amazon.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/George-Ghost-Nyack-Merrill-Johnson/dp/1883832055|title=Sir George The Ghost Of Nyack|last=Johnson|first=Bill Merrill &amp; Glenn|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Deer Publishing Co.|isbn=9781883832056|location=Beaverton, Or.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Helen claimed to have seen Sir George: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;sitting in midair, watching me paint the ceiling in the living room, rocking back and forth... I was on an 8-foot stepladder. I asked if he approved of what we were doing to the house, if the colors were to his liking. He smiled and he nodded his head.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Helen's daughter, Cynthia, when she was a child, reportedly would be woken most mornings by one of the spirits shaking her bed. When Cynthia was out of school for spring break she announced loudly before going to bed that she did not have school in the morning and would like to sleep in. The next morning she was not awoken by a shaking bed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Helen reported to neighbors that they heard phantom footsteps and slamming doors.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyacknewsandviews.com/2014/10/nsl_legally_haunted_house/|title=Nyack Sketch Log: A Legally Haunted House  • Nyack News and Views|website=www.nyacknewsandviews.com|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Helen's grandchildren allegedly received trinkets, such as rings, from the ghosts. These trinkets would later vanish.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Helen's daughter-in-law was gifted disappearing coins in the same manner, and Cynthia as an adult, claimed to receive silver sugar tongs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Helen claimed that her son came "eyeball-to-eyeball" with the figure of the Revolutionary Navy Lieutenant.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Mark Kavanagh lived in the home briefly while engaged to Cynthia, he purported hearing converstation from a vacant room.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Later Kavanagh recounted another experience:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cyn had already fallen asleep and I was drifting. Then I heard the bedroom door creak, and the floor boards squeak. My back was to the edge of the bed. Suddenly the edge of the bed by my mid-section depressed down, and I felt something lean against me. I went literally stone stiff! I was speechless and could hardly move. I was able to twist my neck around enough to see a womanly figure in a soft dress through the moonlight from the bay windows. I felt like she was looking straight at me. After about minute, the presence got up and walked back out of the room. I finally relaxed enough to shake my wife out of sound sleep acting like a toddler who just had a nightmare.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All but Kavanagh's accounts were written by Helen and submitted to ''Reader's Digest'' magazine and published in its May 1977 issue.

Despite these somewhat unnerving tales, the Ackleys said they had a peaceful coexistence with the poltergeists, and the only account of any terrorizing events is Kavanagh's tale reproduced above.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Kavanagh later reflected on the incidents that he experienced and came to the conclusion that the ghosts were evaluating him to make sure he was a good suitor for Cynthia.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Since the Ackleys moved from the home in the beginning of the 1990s there have not been any more accounts of paranormal activity reported by any of the subsequent owners of which there have been three.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, Merrill and Johnson reported that Sir George and Lady Margaret expressed that the spirits were not as fond of the new owners and were thinking of moving on.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://delawareparanormal.blogspot.com/2015/08/helen-ackleys-haunted-house-on-hudson.html|title=The Shore : Helen Ackley's Haunted House on the Hudson|last=Strom-mackey|first=Robin M.|date=2015-08-02|website=The Shore|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also reported that after the judgment against Helen in the lawsuit she claimed that she was moving and taking the ghosts with her.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==The house - history and today==
The imposing Victorian waterfront home was built in 1890 with 5 bedrooms, 3 ½ baths, and approximately 4,628 square feet. George and Helen Ackley purchased the home in the early 1960s and shared the home with their four children, Cynthia, George, Cara, and William.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ktransit.com/Kavanagh/kavanagh.htm|title=Kavanagh Website -&gt; Family Page|website=www.ktransit.com|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; George died in 1978 at the age of 53, less than one year after the first accounts of paranormal activity appeared in ''Reader's Digest''.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~ohclark/obituary/query078.htm|title=Clark County, OH, Posted Obituaries for|website=www.rootsweb.ancestry.com|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though his death was not in the home, but at an area hospital after heart surgery, however there was a death in the home sometime after when a relatively young and otherwise healthy dinner guest died of a brain aneurysm.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; By 1990 the residents included Helen's grandchildren, daughter-in-law and future son-in-law, Mark Kavanagh.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The ''Ghostbusters'' home sold on Jan 8, 2016 for more than $600,000 above comparable homes in Nyack according to Trulia, fetching $1,770,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trulia.com/homes/New_York/Nyack/sold/1000301866-1-Laveta-Pl-Nyack-NY-10960|title=1 Laveta Place, Nyack, NY {{!}} Trulia.com|website=Trulia Real Estate Search|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exterior of the home was red for some time, though it has now been painted light blue.

[[Image:Kuwana - The sailor Tokuso and the sea monster.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Ukiyo-e]]'' print of the sailor Tokuso encountering an ''umibōzu'', by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]]]]
{{Nihongo|'''Umibōzu'''|海坊主||"sea [[bonze]]"}} is a spirit from [[Japanese folklore]].

==Mythology==
The Umibōzu is said to live in the ocean and capsize the ship of anyone who dares speak to it. This spirit's name -- which combines the character for "sea" with the character for "Buddhist monk" -- is possibly related to the fact that the Umibōzu is said to have a large, round head resembling the shaven heads of Buddhist monks.
Alternatively, it is a demonic [[Yōkai]] ([[Ghost#Terminology|spectre]]s) that appear to shipwreck victims and fishermen. It is believed to be a drowned priest, exhibiting a shaven head and typically appears to be praying, along with having a perpetual smile. It is usually reported as having a grey, cloud-like torso and serpentine limbs.

According to one story, if angered (commonly when seamen insult or disrespect them), it asks that the crews provide a barrel that it proceeds to fill with sea water to drown them. To avoid this disastrous fate, it is necessary to give him a bottomless barrel.

This folktale is likely related to another Japanese tradition, which says that the souls of people who have no one to look after their graves take refuge at sea.

==In popular culture==
[[Image:Obake Karuta 4-10.jpg|180px|thumb|Edo-period ''[[obake karuta]]'' card depicting an ''umibōzu'']]
The umibōzu is a very well known yōkai as it is also recognized in modern Japanese culture:

* A traditional Umibōzu folktale is told in the second story arc of the anime ''[[Mononoke (TV series)|Mononoke]]'', a sequel to ''[[Ayakashi: Samurai Horror Tales]]'', which combined folktales, Kabuki plays, and animated versions of 19th century woodblock art prints to retell classic ghost stories.
* In the anime ''[[3000 Leagues in Search of Mother]]'', episode 17-The Party for Equator (1976), Marco is fishing to catch a 'sea bonze'.
* Although not a main character, several Umibozu were seen in the fight against the demon in [[Great Yokai War]].
* The umibōzu is also a monster of the day in the ''[[Super Sentai]]'' series ''[[Ninja Sentai Kakuranger]]'' and also appears as ''Hydro Hog'' in season 3 of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'' in the 10 episode arc ''[[Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers]]''.
* Umi-Bozu is a sub-boss in the arcade video game ''[[The Ocean Hunter]]''. Umi-Bozu appear as a giant octopus that can become invisible.
* The anime ''[[One Piece]]'' contains a large underwater giant named Wadatsumi, he shares many of the characteristics of a sea bonze and is referred to as such by several of the main characters.
* In the anime and manga comic [[City Hunter]], Umibozu is a big strong bald character.
* The manga [[Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin]] depicts the strongest dog of Japan, 'Benizakura', who's nicknamed 'Umibōzu' due to the champion's loss of its both ears and therefore resembling the sea monster.
* The anime [[Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex]] features an elite [[MSDF]] special forces unit nicknamed 'Umibozu', wearing dark grey armor and fielding high-end armorsuits.
* In the anime adaptation of [[Hanayamata]], the character Masaru Ōfuna, a [[yosakoi]] goods store owner, is nicknamed 'Umibozu' because of his shaved head.
* The anime [[Gintama]] contains a bald humanoid named 'Umibouzu', known to be the most powerful alien-hunter in the universe.
* The Waterwraith from [[Pikmin 2]] and the Plasm Wraith from [[Pikmin 3]], both called "Amebouzu" in Japan, have a liquid, translucent form that can not be harmed and chase after the player.
* The Umibozu appears in ''[[Yo-kai Watch]]'' with its English dub name being Swosh. It is depicted as a recolored version of Dromp (the English dub name for [[Daidarabotchi]]).
* In the anime and manga ''[[Love_Com|Lovely Complex]]'', Umibōzu is popular hip hop artist, whose music is characterized by angry lyrics, rough syncopated beats, and socio-political commentary.
* In the Video Game ''[[Nioh]]'', Umi-Bozu appears as the boss of the Ocean Roars Again mission.
* Umi Bozu is [[Monster in My Pocket]] #118.
* In the Visual Novel [[Kajiri Kamui Kagura]], an expedition crossing the ocean to the eastern side of Japan encounters a spirit resembling an Umibouzu which tries to capsize their fleet.

'''Valentina Maureira Riquelme''' (2000/01 – May 14, 2015) was a Chilean teenager who gained international attention after using [[social media]] to ask Chilean President [[Michele Bachelet]] to allow her to die by [[euthanasia]]. Bachelet denied her request.&lt;ref name="inquisitr.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/1891015/valentina-maureira-president-responds-to-teenagers-euthanasia-request/|title=Valentina Maureira: President Responds To Teenager's Euthanasia Request|date=3 March 2015|work=The Inquisitr News|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Maureira was the daughter of Freddy Maureira and had a brother who died at the age of six of [[cystic fibrosis]]. She was herself diagnosed with the disease shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name="inquisitr.com"/&gt;

Early in 2015, she used [[YouTube]] to post a video asking President Bachelet to allow her to be [[Euthanasia|euthanised]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/cystic-fibrosis-sufferer-valentina-maureira-fails-in-euthanasia-plea-to-chile-president-michelle-bachelet/story-fneuzlbd-1227240961852|title=Cystic fibrosis sufferer Valentina Maureira’s euthanasia plea fails|date=27 February 2015|work=NewsComAu|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachelet denied the request based on Chile's laws, citing the Catholicism in their country as a reason to enforce those laws. 

Days later, President Bachelet visited the stricken girl in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/01/chile-president-michelle-bachelet-valentina-maureira-cystic-fibrosis-euthanasia-video|title=Chile president visits girl with cystic fibrosis who posted euthanasia video|date=28 February 2015|work=the Guardian|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until 23 March, Maureira received public support for her wellbeing and met someone aged beyond 20 with similar disease, prompting her to change her mind about euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lucy Sherriff Multimedia editor, The Huffington Post UK |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/03/23/teen-euthanasia-changes-mind-public-support_n_6922440.html |title=Valentina Maureira, 14, Changes Her Mind About Wanting Euthanasia After Outpouring Of Public Support |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=2015-03-23 |accessdate=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May, Maureira died at age 14 in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/chilean-girl-who-asked-president-let-her-die-passes-away-n359486 |title=Chilean Girl Who Asked To Be Allowed To Die Passes Away |publisher=NBC News |date= |accessdate=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition --&gt;
'''Violence''' is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as "the intentional use of physical force or [[Power (social and political)|power]], threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation," although the group acknowledges that the inclusion of "the use of power" in its definition expands on the conventional understanding of the word.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;Krug et al., [http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ "World report on violence and health"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822172354/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ |date=2015-08-22 }}, [[World Health Organization]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;
Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990.&lt;ref name=GDB2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71|pmc=4340604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm ([[suicide]]), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence ([[war]]) and legal intervention.&lt;ref name=GDB2013 /&gt; In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death.&lt;ref&gt;awake Aug 8/05 pp. 4-7&lt;/ref&gt; Corlin, past president of the [[American Medical Association]] said: "The United States leads the world—in the rate at which its children die from firearms." He concluded: "Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country."&lt;ref&gt;Awake Jul 8/2003 pp. 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/ "Global Burden of Disease"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009053208/http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/ |date=2015-10-09 }}, World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development.

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;
In 2013, assault by [[firearm]] was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes.&lt;ref name=GDB2013 /&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention --&gt;
Violence in many forms is preventable. There is a strong relationship between levels of violence and modifiable factors such as [[concentrated poverty]], income and gender inequality, the harmful use of alcohol, and the absence of safe, stable, and nurturing relationships between children and parents. Strategies addressing the underlying causes of violence can be effective in preventing violence.&lt;ref&gt;WHO / Liverpool JMU Centre for Public Health, [http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/4th_milestones_meeting/publications/en/ "Violence Prevention: The evidence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830082343/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/4th_milestones_meeting/publications/en/ |date=2012-08-30 }}, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
[[File:Typology of violence.jpg|thumb|Typology of violence&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;]]
Violence can be divided into three broad categories:&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;
* self-directed violence
* interpersonal violence
* collective violence

Violent acts can be:
* physical
* sexual
* physiological
* emotional

This initial categorization differentiates between violence a person inflicts upon himself or herself, violence inflicted by another individual or by a small group of individuals, and violence inflicted by larger groups such as states, organized political groups, militia groups and terrorist organizations. These three broad categories are each divided further to reflect more specific types of violence.

Violence is primarily classified as either instrumental or reactive / hostile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://curry.virginia.edu/uploads/resourceLibrary/Violence_Coding_Guide_for_Instrumental_and_Hostile-Reactive_Incidents_10-5-13.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915221238/http://curry.virginia.edu/uploads/resourceLibrary/Violence_Coding_Guide_for_Instrumental_and_Hostile-Reactive_Incidents_10-5-13.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-directed violence ===
Self-directed violence is subdivided into suicidal behaviour and [[Self-harm|self-abuse]]. The former includes [[suicidal thoughts]], [[attempted suicide]]s – also called ''[[para suicide]]'' or ''deliberate self-injury'' in some countries – and completed suicides. Self-abuse, in contrast, includes acts such as [[self-mutilation]].

=== Collective violence ===
{{Citation style|date=February 2017}}
[[File:The Bochnia massacre German-occupied Poland 1939.jpg|thumb|right|[[Massacre]] of [[Poles|Polish]] civilians during [[Nazi occupation of Poland]], 1939]]

Collective violence is subdivided into [[structural violence]] and [[economic violence]]. Unlike the other two broad categories, the subcategories of collective violence suggest possible motives for violence committed by larger groups of individuals or by states. Collective violence that is committed to advance a particular social agenda includes, for example, crimes of hate committed by organized groups, terrorist acts and mob violence. Political violence includes war and related violent conflicts, state violence and similar acts carried out by larger groups. Economic violence includes attacks by larger groups motivated by economic gain – such as attacks carried out with the purpose of disrupting economic activity, denying access to essential services, or creating economic division and fragmentation. Clearly, acts committed by larger groups can have multiple motives.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1300/J137v04n02_03|title=Poverty as a Form of Violence|journal=Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment|volume=4|issue=2–3|pages=45–59|year=2001|last1=Allen|first1=Josephine A. V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This typology, while imperfect and far from being universally accepted, does provide a useful framework for understanding the complex patterns of violence taking place around the world, as well as violence in the everyday lives of individuals, families and communities. It also overcomes many of the limitations of other typologies by capturing the nature of violent acts, the relevance of the setting, the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, and – in the case of collective violence – possible motivations for the violence. However, in both research and practice, the dividing lines between the different types of violence are not always so clear.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}. State violence also involves upholding, forms of violence of a structural nature, such as poverty, through dismantling welfare, creating strict policies such as 'welfare to work', in order to cause further stimulation and disadvantage&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Poverty as a form of violence may involve oppressive policies that specifically target minority or low socio-economic groups. The 'war on drugs', for example, rather than increasing the health and well-being of at risk demographics, most often results in violence committed against these vulnerable demographics through incarceration, stigmatization and police brutality&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02249526|title=Political ideologies and drug policy|journal=European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research|volume=1|pages=94–105|year=1993|last1=Scheerer|first1=Sebastian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Warfare ===

{{Main|War}}

[[File:UStankParis-edit1.jpg|thumb|A United States [[M8 Greyhound]] armoured car in Paris during World War II]]
War is a state of prolonged violent large-scale conflict involving two or more groups of people, usually under the auspices of government. It is the most extreme form of collective violence.&lt;ref&gt;Šmihula, Daniel (2013): ''The Use of Force in International Relations'',  p. 64, {{ISBN|978-80-224-1341-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
War is fought as a means of resolving territorial and other conflicts, as [[war of aggression]] to conquer territory or loot resources, in national [[self-defence]] or liberation, or to suppress attempts of part of the nation to [[secession|secede]] from it. We know also ideological, religious and revolutionary wars.&lt;ref&gt;Šmihula, Daniel (2013): ''The Use of Force in International Relations'',  p. 84, {{ISBN|978-80-224-1341-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Industrial Revolution]], the lethality of modern warfare has grown. [[World War I casualties]] were over 40 million and [[World War II casualties]] were over 70 million.

=== Non-physical ===
Violence includes those acts that result from a power relationship, including threats and [[intimidation]], [[neglect]] or acts of omission. Such non-physical violence has a broad range of outcomes – including psychological harm, deprivation and maldevelopment. Violence may not necessarily result in injury or death, but nonetheless poses a substantial burden on individuals, families, communities and health care systems worldwide. Many forms of violence can result in physical, psychological and social problems that do not necessarily lead to injury, disability or death. These consequences can be immediate, as well as latent, and can last for years after the initial abuse. Defining outcomes solely in terms of injury or death thus limits the understanding of the full impact of violence.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

=== Interpersonal violence ===
[[File:Interpersonal violence world map-Deaths per million persons-WHO2012.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Deaths due to interpersonal violence per million persons in 2012 {{refbegin|3}}{{legend|#ffff20|0-8}}{{legend|#ffe820|9-16}}{{legend|#ffd820|17-24}}{{legend|#ffc020|25-32}}{{legend|#ffa020|33-54}}{{legend|#ff9a20|55-75}}{{legend|#f08015|76-96}}{{legend|#e06815|97-126}}{{legend|#d85010|127-226}}{{legend|#d02010|227-878}}{{refend}}]]
Interpersonal violence is divided into two subcategories: Family and [[intimate partner violence]] – that is, violence largely between family members and intimate partners, usually, though not exclusively, taking place in the home. Community violence – violence between individuals who are unrelated, and who may or may not know each other, generally taking place outside the home. The former group includes forms of violence such as [[child abuse]], intimate partner violence and [[elderly abuse|abuse of the elderly]]. The latter includes youth violence, random acts of violence, [[rape]] or [[sexual assault]] by strangers, and violence in institutional settings such as schools, workplaces, prisons and nursing homes.  When interpersonal violence occurs in families, its psychological consequences can affect parents, children, and their relationship in the short- and long-terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schechter DS, Willheim E, McCaw J, Turner JB, Myers MM, Zeanah CH | year = 2011 | title = The relationship of violent fathers, posttraumatically stressed mothers, and symptomatic children in a preschool-age inner-city pediatrics clinic sample | url = | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 26 | issue = 18| pages = 3699–3719 | doi=10.1177/0886260511403747 | pmid=22170456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Child maltreatment ====
{{Main|Child abuse}}
Child maltreatment is the abuse and neglect that occurs to children under 18 years of age. It includes all types of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]], [[neglect]], [[negligence]] and commercial or other [[child exploitation]], which results in actual or potential harm to the child’s health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust, or power. Exposure to intimate partner violence is also sometimes included as a form of child maltreatment.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (2006). [http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/violence/child_maltreatment/en/index.html "Preventing child maltreatment: a guide to taking action and generating evidence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719072520/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/violence/child_maltreatment/en/index.html |date=2012-07-19 }} Geneva: WHO and International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect.&lt;/ref&gt;

Child maltreatment is a global problem with serious lifelong consequences, which is, however, complex and difficult to study.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Willheim E (2009).  The Effects of Violent Experience and Maltreatment on Infants and Young Children.  In CH Zeanah (Ed.).  Handbook of Infant Mental Health—3rd Edition.  New York: Guilford Press, Inc.  pp. 197-214.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no reliable global estimates for the prevalence of child maltreatment. Data for many countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are lacking. Current estimates vary widely depending on the country and the method of research used. Approximately 20% of women and 5–10% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25–50% of all children report being physically abused.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Stoltenborgh M. |author2=Van IJzendoorn M.H. |author3=Euser E.M. |author4=Bakermans-Kranenburg M.J. | year = 2011 | title = A global perspective on child abuse: Meta-analysis of prevalence around the world | url = | journal = Child Maltreatment | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 79–101 | doi = 10.1177/1077559511403920 |pmid=21511741 |citeseerx=10.1.1.1029.9752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequences of child maltreatment include impaired lifelong physical and mental health, and social and occupational functioning (e.g. school, job, and relationship difficulties). These can ultimately slow a country's economic and social development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gilbert R. |author2=Spatz Widom C. |author3=Browne K. |author4=Fergusson D. |author5=Webb E. |author6=Janson J. | year = 2009 | title = Burden and consequences of child maltreatment in high-income countries | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 373 | issue = 9657| pages = 68–81 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(08)61706-7 | pmid=19056114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ace/index.html|title=Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preventing child maltreatment before it starts is possible and requires a multisectoral approach.

==== Youth violence ====
[[File:Kids off the Block Rocks in grass IMG 4815.JPG|thumb|The [[Kids off the Block]] memorial featuring hundreds of simple stone blocks, one for each child killed by violence in [[Roseland, Chicago]] ]]

Following the World Health Organization, youth are defined as people between the ages of 10 and 29 years. Youth violence refers to violence occurring between youths, and includes acts that range from [[bullying]] and physical fighting, through more severe sexual and physical assault to homicide.&lt;ref name="Mercy, J.A. 2002 pp 23"&gt;Mercy, J.A., Butchart, A., Farrington, D., Cerda, M. (2002). Youth violence. In Etienne Krug, L.L. Dahlberg, J.A. Mercy, A.B. Zwi &amp; R. Lozano (Eds.), [http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ World Report on Violence and Health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822172354/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ |date=2015-08-22 }} pp 23–56. Geneva, Switzerland: [[World Health Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide some 250,000 homicides occur among youth 10–29 years of age each year, which is 41% of the total number of homicides globally each year ("Global Burden of Disease", World Health Organization, 2008). For each young person killed, 20-40 more sustain injuries requiring hospital treatment.&lt;ref name="Mercy, J.A. 2002 pp 23" /&gt; Youth violence has a serious, often lifelong, impact on a person's psychological and social functioning. Youth violence greatly increases the costs of health, welfare and criminal justice services; reduces productivity; decreases the value of property; and generally undermines the fabric of society.

Prevention programmes shown to be effective or to have promise in reducing youth violence include life skills and social development programmes designed to help children and adolescents manage anger, resolve conflict, and develop the necessary social skills to solve problems; schools-based anti-bullying prevention programmes; and programmes to reduce access to alcohol, illegal drugs and guns.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization and Liverpool John Moores University.[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241598507_eng.pdf "Violence prevention: the evidence: overview"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122193235/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241598507_eng.pdf |date=2013-01-22 }} Geneva, WHO, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, given significant neighbourhood effects on youth violence, interventions involving relocating families to less poor environments have shown promising results.&lt;ref name="Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/1467-8721.01216 | volume=12 | title=Children and youth in neighborhood contexts | journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science | pages=27–31 | year=2003 | author=Leventhal Tama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, urban renewal projects such as [[business improvement district]]s have shown a reduction in youth violence.&lt;ref name="Rand report"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/technical_reports/2009/RAND_TR622.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020054800/http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/technical_reports/2009/RAND_TR622.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different types of youth on youth violence include witnessing or being involved in physical, emotional and sexual abuse (e.g. physical attacks, bullying, rape) and violent acts like gang shootings and robberies.  According to researchers in 2018, "More than half of children and adolescents living in cities have experienced some form of community violence." The violence "can also all take place under one roof, or in a given community or neighborhood and can happen at the same time or at different stages of life." &lt;ref name="The Conversation US Darby Saxbe 2018"&gt;{{cite magazine | department=The Conversation US |author=Darby Saxbe | title=Living with Neighborhood Violence May Shape Teens' Brains | magazine=Scientific American | date=June 15, 2018 |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/living-with-neighborhood-violence-may-shape-teens-rsquo-brains/ | access-date=November 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;    It seems that youth violence is on the rise due to the growing number of legal and illegal guns on the streets especially in low income neighborhoods. Youth violence has immediate and long term adverse impact whether the individual was the recipient of the violence or a witness to it. Our knowledge about the impact of trauma on the brain, mind and body is growing every day as more research studies have been conducted and results are published. "Youth violence is a leading cause of death for adolescents and young adults. Some forms of youth violence, such as bullying, slapping, or hitting, can cause severe emotional harm, nonfatal physical injuries, and long-lasting problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Consequences Youth Violence |url=https://vetoviolence.cdc.gov/consequences-youth-violence |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost to individuals, their families, and society in general is huge and rising. These people often have lifelong injuries which means ongoing doctor and hospital visits the cost of which quickly adds up. Since the victims of youth on youth violence may not be able to attend school or work because of their physical and/or mental injuries, it is often up to their family members to take care of them (including paying their daily living expenses and medical bills). Their caretakers may have to give up their jobs or work reduced hours to provide help to the victim of violence. This causes a further burden on society because the victim and maybe even their caretakers have to obtain government assistance to help pay their bills. Recent research has found that psychological trauma during childhood can change a child's brain. "Trauma is known to physically affect the brain and the body which causes anxiety, rage, and the ability to concentrate. They can also have problems remembering, trusting, and forming relationships." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk, M.D. |first1=Bessel |title=The Body Keeps The Score |date=09/08/2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9780143127741 |pages=464 |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/313183/the-body-keeps-the-score-by-bessel-van-der-kolk-md/9780143127741 |accessdate=11/24/18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the brain becomes used to violence it may stay continually in an alert state (similar to being stuck in the fight or flight mode). "Researchers claim that the youth who are exposed to violence may have emotional, social, and cognitive problems. They may have trouble controlling emotions, paying attention in school, withdraw from friends, or show signs of post-traumatic stress disorder".&lt;ref name="The Conversation US Darby Saxbe 2018" /&gt; Youth who do not get help and get it under control may have more issues down the line.

It is important for youth exposed to violence to understand how their bodies may react so they can take positive steps to counteract any possible short and long term negative effects (e.g., poor concentration, feelings of depression, heightened levels of anxiety). By taking immediate steps to mitigate the effects of the trauma they’ve experienced negative repercussions can be reduced or eliminated. As an initial step, the kids need to understand why they may be feeling a certain way and to understand how the violence they have experienced may be causing negative feelings and making them behave differently. Pursuing a greater awareness of their feelings, perceptions, and negative emotions is the first step that should be taken as part of recovering from the trauma they have experienced. “Neuroscience research shows that the only way we can change the way we feel is by becoming aware of our inner experience and learning to befriend what is going on inside ourselves”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk, M.D. |first1=Bessel |title=The Body Keeps The Score |date=September 8, 2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9780143127741 |pages=464 |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/313183/the-body-keeps-the-score-by-bessel-van-der-kolk-md/9780143127741 |accessdate=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this initial awareness step is not sufficiently completed the youth may then knowingly or unknowingly resort to bullying as a way to release their own anger, compulsive behaviors (eating, drinking, drugs), anger management problems; and avoidance of social interactions. These types of behaviors may put them at an even greater risk for future violence in their lives. 
 
Some of the ways to combat the adverse effects of exposure to youth violence would be to try various mindfulness and movement activities, deep breathing exercises and  other actions that enable these kids to release their pent up emotions. Using these techniques will teach body awareness, reduce anxiety and nervousness, and reduce feelings of anger and annoyance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk, M.D. |first1=Bessel |title=The Body Keeps The Score |date=September 8, 2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9780143127741 |pages=464 |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/313183/the-body-keeps-the-score-by-bessel-van-der-kolk-md/9780143127741}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time these types of activities will help these younger victims of violence to have greater control over their feelings and behaviors and avoid unhealthy ways of coping. Another way to help trauma victims of youth violence is through the arts. This can be accomplished by giving them the opportunity to engage in drawing, painting, music, and singing which will give them an outlet to express themselves and their emotions in a positive way.

It’s been discovered that having youth who have experienced violence benefit from having a close relationship with one or more people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk, M.D. |first1=Bessel |title=The Body Keeps The Score |date=Setember 08, 2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9780143127741 |pages=464 |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/313183/the-body-keeps-the-score-by-bessel-van-der-kolk-md/9780143127741 |accessdate=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important because the trauma victims need to have people who are safe and trustworthy that they can relate and talk to about their horrible experiences. Some youth do not have adult figures at home or someone they can count on for guidance and comfort. Schools in bad neighborhoods where youth violence is prevalent should assign counselors to each student so that they receive regular guidance. In addition to counseling/therapy sessions and programs, schools should offer mentoring programs where the kids can interact with adults who can be a positive influence on them. Another way is to create more neighborhood programs to ensure that each child has a positive and stable place to go when school in not in session. It doesn’t have to be a formal organization just a place where the kids can have positive role models in their lives and engage in stress relieving activities (sports, yoga, and arts). Many kids have benefited from formal organizations now which aim to help mentor and provide a safe environment for the youth especially those living in neighborhoods with higher rates of violence. This includes organizations such as Becoming a Man, CeaseFire Illinois, Chicago Area Project, Little Black Pearl, and Rainbow House".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WCL: Stop the Violence Resources for Illinois |url=https://abc7chicago.com/archive/9009544/ |website=ABC 7 Windy City Live |publisher=ABC 7 Windy City Live |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are designed to help give the youth a safe place to go, stop the violence from occurring, offering counseling and mentoring to help stop the cycle of violence. For example, Derek grew up amongst the violence in Chicago in the 1980's and was even a former gang leader. It took him thirty years in a gang and time in jail to realize he was on the wrong path. He created a boxing program called "Boxing Out Negativity" which provides youth in high crime areas a safe place to get out their anger and energy. It helps them in a positive way and keeps them off the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schmich |first1=Mary |title=In a tough Chicago neighborhood, comfort and safety in boxing |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/schmich/ct-chicago-violence-lawndale-boxing-mary-schmich-0918-20160916-column.html |accessdate=11/20/18 |publisher=Chicago Tribume |date=09/16/16}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of programs to help victims of youth violence there is a greater opportunity for these youth to turn their lives around.

==== Intimate partner violence ====
{{Main|Domestic violence|Intimate partner violence}}
Intimate partner violence refers to behaviour in an intimate relationship that causes physical, sexual or psychological harm, including physical aggression, sexual coercion, psychological abuse and controlling behaviours.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

Population-level surveys based on reports from victims provide the most accurate estimates of the prevalence of intimate partner violence and sexual violence in non-conflict settings. A study conducted by WHO in 10 mainly developing countries&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Moreno, C. et al. (2005). [http://www.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/en/ "WHO multi-country study on women’s health and domestic violence against women"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224124426/http://www.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/en/ |date=2011-02-24 }} Geneva: WHO&lt;/ref&gt; found that, among women aged 15 to 49 years, between 15% (Japan) and 70%  (Ethiopia and Peru) of women reported physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner.

Intimate partner and sexual violence have serious short- and long-term physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health problems for victims and for their children, and lead to high social and economic costs. These include both fatal and non-fatal injuries, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, [[unintended pregnancy|unintended pregnancies]], sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stith SM | year = 2004 | title = Intimate partner physical abuse perpetration and victimization risk factors: a meta-analytic review | url = | journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 65–98 | doi=10.1016/j.avb.2003.09.001|display-authors=etal| hdl = 2097/14851 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors associated with the perpetration and experiencing of intimate partner violence are low levels of education, history of violence as a perpetrator, a victim or a witness of parental violence, harmful use of alcohol, attitudes that are accepting of violence as well as marital discord and dissatisfaction. Factors associated only with perpetration of intimate partner violence are having multiple partners, and [[antisocial personality disorder]].

A recent theory named "The [[Criminal Spin]]" suggests a mutual flywheel effect between partners that is manifested by an escalation in the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bensimon M. |author2=Ronel N. | year = 2012 | title = The flywheel effect of intimate partner violence: A victim-perpetrator interactive spin | url = | journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 423–429 | doi=10.1016/j.avb.2012.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A violent spin may occur in any other forms of violence, but in Intimate partner violence the added value is the mutual spin, based on the unique situation and characteristics of intimate relationship.

The primary prevention strategy with the best evidence for effectiveness for intimate partner violence is school-based programming for adolescents to prevent violence within dating relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Foshee V.A. | year = 2004 | title = Assessing the long-term effects of the Safe Dates program and a booster in preventing and reducing adolescent dating violence victimization and perpetration | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 94 | issue = 4| pages = 619–624 | doi=10.2105/ajph.94.4.619|display-authors=etal| pmc = 1448308 | pmid=15054015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence is emerging for the effectiveness of several other primary prevention strategies – those that: combine microfinance with gender equality training;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kim J | year = 2009 | title = Assessing the incremental effects of combining economic and health interventions: the IMAGE study in South Africa | url = | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 87 | issue = 11| pages = 824–832 | doi=10.2471/blt.08.056580|display-authors=etal| pmc = 2770274 | pmid=20072767}}&lt;/ref&gt; promote communication and relationship skills within communities; reduce access to, and the harmful use of alcohol; and change cultural gender norms.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;WHO(2010).[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/violence/9789241564007_eng.pdf "Preventing intimate partner and sexual violence against women: Taking action and generating evidence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112035242/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/violence/9789241564007_eng.pdf |date=2011-11-12 }} World Health Organization: Geneva&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sexual violence ====
{{Main|Sexual violence}}
[[File:DRC raped women.jpg|thumb|Meeting of victims of [[sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]].]]
Sexual violence is any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed against a person’s sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting. It includes rape, defined as the physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration of the vulva or anus with a penis, other body part or object.&lt;ref&gt;Krug et al.,[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ "World report on violence and health"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822172354/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ |date=2015-08-22 }}, World Health Organization, 2002, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Population-level surveys based on reports from victims estimate that between 0.3–11.5% of women reported experiencing sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Moreno, C. et al. (2005).[http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/violence/24159358X/en/ "WHO multi-country study on women’s health and domestic violence against women"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122193441/http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/violence/24159358X/en/ |date=2013-01-22 }} Geneva: WHO&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence has serious short- and long-term consequences on physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health for victims and for their children as described in the section on intimate partner violence. If perpetrated during childhood, sexual violence can lead to increased smoking,&lt;ref&gt;Ford, S.E. et al. (2011). Adverse childhood experiences and smoking status in five states. Preventive Medicine: 43, 3, 188-193.&lt;/ref&gt; drug and alcohol misuse, and risky sexual behaviors in later life. It is also associated with perpetration of violence and being a victim of violence.

Many of the risk factors for sexual violence are the same as for [[domestic violence]]. Risk factors specific to sexual violence perpetration include beliefs in family honor and sexual purity, ideologies of male sexual entitlement and weak legal sanctions for sexual violence.

Few interventions to prevent sexual violence have been demonstrated to be effective. School-based programmes to prevent child sexual abuse by teaching children to recognize and avoid potentially sexually abusive situations are run in many parts of the world and appear promising, but require further research. To achieve lasting change, it is important to enact legislation and develop policies that protect women; address discrimination against women and promote gender equality; and help to move the culture away from violence.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt;

==== Elder maltreatment ====
{{Main|Elder abuse}}
Elder maltreatment is a single or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person. This type of violence constitutes a violation of human rights and includes [[physical abuse|physical]], [[sexual abuse|sexual]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], emotional; [[financial abuse|financial]] and material abuse; abandonment; [[neglect]]; and serious loss of [[dignity]] and [[respect]].&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

While there is little information regarding the extent of maltreatment in elderly populations, especially in developing countries, it is estimated that 4–6% of elderly people in high-income countries have experienced some form of maltreatment at home&lt;ref&gt;Sethi et al. [http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/health-topics/Life-stages/healthy-ageing/publications/2011/european-report-on-preventing-elder-maltreatment "WHO European report on preventing elder maltreatment"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122231547/http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/health-topics/Life-stages/healthy-ageing/publications/2011/european-report-on-preventing-elder-maltreatment |date=2013-01-22 }}, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper C, Selwood A, Livingston G | year = 2008 | title = The prevalence of elder abuse and neglect: a systematic review | url = | journal = Age Ageing | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 151–60 | doi=10.1093/ageing/afm194 | pmid=18349012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, older people are often afraid to report cases of maltreatment to family, friends, or to the authorities. Data on the extent of the problem in institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are scarce. Elder maltreatment can lead to serious physical injuries and long-term psychological consequences. Elder maltreatment is predicted to increase as many countries are experiencing rapidly ageing populations.

Many strategies have been implemented to prevent elder maltreatment and to take action against it and mitigate its consequences including public and professional awareness campaigns, screening (of potential victims and abusers), caregiver support interventions (e.g. stress management, respite care), adult protective services and self-help groups. Their effectiveness has, however, not so far been well-established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ploeg Jenny |author2=Fear Jana |author3=Hutchison Brian |author4=MacMillan Harriet |author5=Bolan Gale | year = 2009 | title = A Systematic Review of Interventions for Elder Abuse | url = | journal = Journal of Elder Abuse &amp; Neglect | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 187–210 | doi=10.1080/08946560902997181|pmid=19827325 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pillemer K et al.

=== Targeted violence ===

Several rare but painful episodes of [[assassination]], attempted assassination and [[school shooting]]s at elementary, middle, high schools, as well as colleges and universities in the United States, led to a considerable body of research on ascertainable behaviors of persons who have planned or carried out such attacks. These studies (1995–2002) investigated what the authors called "targeted violence," described the "path to violence" of those who planned or carried out attacks and laid out suggestions for law enforcement and educators. A major point from these research studies is that targeted violence does not just "come out of the blue".&lt;ref&gt;Fein, R.A., Vossekuil, B. &amp; Holden, G.

=== Everyday violence ===
As an anthropological concept, "everyday violence" may refer to the incorporation of different forms of violence (mainly political violence) into daily practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gammeltoft|first=Tine M.|date=2016-12-01|title=Silence as a Response to Everyday Violence: Understanding Domination and Distress Through the Lens of Fantasy|journal=Ethos|volume=44|issue=4|pages=427–447|doi=10.1111/etho.12140|issn=1548-1352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ethnographyofpoliticalviolence.wordpress.com/tag/everyday-violence/|title=everyday violence {{!}} The Ethnography of Political Violence|website=ethnographyofpoliticalviolence.wordpress.com|access-date=2018-02-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213200042/https://ethnographyofpoliticalviolence.wordpress.com/tag/everyday-violence/|archivedate=2018-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://istmo.denison.edu/n08/articulos/power.html|title=Philippe Bourgois - The Power of Violence in War and Peace|website=istmo.denison.edu|access-date=2018-02-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423065302/http://istmo.denison.edu/n08/articulos/power.html|archivedate=2016-04-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors ==
Violence cannot be attributed to a single factor. Its causes are complex and occur at different levels. To represent this complexity, the ecological, or [[social ecological model]] is often used. The following four-level version of the ecological model is often used in the study of violence:

The first level identifies biological and personal factors that influence how individuals behave and increase their likelihood of becoming a victim or perpetrator of violence: demographic characteristics (age, education, income), [[Genetics of aggression|genetics]], [[brain lesion theory|brain lesions]], [[personality disorders]], [[substance abuse]], and a history of experiencing, witnessing, or engaging in violent behaviour.&lt;ref name=Patrick&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patrick | first1 = C. J. | title = Psychophysiological correlates of aggression and violence: An integrative review | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 363 | issue = 1503 | pages = 2543–2555 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18434285 | pmc = 2606710 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCrory&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCrory | first1 = E. | last2 = De Brito | first2 = S. A. | last3 = Viding | first3 = E. | title = The link between child abuse and psychopathology: A review of neurobiological and genetic research | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 105 | issue = 4 | pages = 151–156 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22532655 | pmc =  3343716| doi = 10.1258/jrsm.2011.110222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second level focuses on close relationships, such as those with family and friends. In youth violence, for example, having friends who engage in or encourage violence can increase a young person’s risk of being a victim or perpetrator of violence. For intimate partner violence, a consistent marker at this level of the model is marital conflict or discord in the relationship. In [[elder abuse]], important factors are stress due to the nature of the past relationship between the abused person and the care giver.

The third level explores the community context—i.e., schools, workplaces, and neighbourhoods. Risk at this level may be affected by factors such as the existence of a local drug trade, the absence of social networks, and concentrated poverty. All these factors have been shown to be important in several types of violence.

Finally, the fourth level looks at the broad societal factors that help to create a climate in which violence is encouraged or inhibited: the responsiveness of the criminal justice system, social and cultural norms regarding gender roles or parent-child relationships, income inequality, the strength of the social welfare system, the social acceptability of violence, the availability of weapons, the exposure to violence in mass media, and political instability.

=== Child-rearing ===

Cross-cultural studies have shown that greater prevalence of [[corporal punishment]] of children tends to predict higher levels of violence in societies. For instance, a 2005 analysis of 186 [[pre-industrial society|pre-industrial societies]] found that corporal punishment was more prevalent in societies which also had higher rates of homicide, assault, and war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045300461.html "Corporal Punishment"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031091526/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045300461.html |date=2010-10-31 }} (2008). ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[domestic corporal punishment]] has been linked to later violent acts against family members and spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gershoff, E.T. |date=2008 |title=Report on Physical Punishment in the United States: What Research Tells Us About Its Effects on Children |format=PDF |location=Columbus, OH |publisher=Center for Effective Discipline |page= |url=http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127213730/http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf |archivedate=2016-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While studies showing associations between physical punishment of children and later aggression cannot prove that physical punishment causes an increase in aggression, a number of [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] suggest that the experience of physical punishment has a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Durrant |first=Joan |last2=Ensom |first2=Ron |date=4 September 2012 |title=Physical punishment of children: lessons from 20 years of research |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=184 |issue=12 |pages=1373–1377 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.101314 |pmid=22311946 |pmc=3447048}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American family violence researcher [[Murray A. Straus]] believes that disciplinary [[spanking]] forms "the most prevalent and important form of violence in American families", whose effects contribute to several major societal problems, including later domestic violence and crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Straus Murray A | year = 2000 | title = Corporal punishment by parents: The cradle of violence in the family and society" (PDF) | url = http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CP62.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Virginia Journal of Social Policy &amp; the Law | volume =  | issue =  | page =  | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111110040441/http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CP62.pdf | archivedate = 2011-11-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychology ===

The causes of violent behaviour in humans are often a topic of research in [[psychology]]. [[Neuroscientist|Neurobiologist]] Jan Volavka emphasizes that, for those purposes, "violent behavior is defined as intentional physically aggressive behavior against another person."&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20071127111237/http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/11/3/307.pdf The Neurobiology of Violence, An Update], Journal of Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci 11:3, Summer 1999. As Mexican Biologist and Scientologist Adri Rodriguez says, Violence is a recurring motif in today's society.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the idea of human nature, scientists do agree violence is inherent in humans. Among prehistoric humans, there is archaeological evidence for both contentions of violence and peacefulness as primary characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Whipps,[http://www.livescience.com/history/060316_peace_violence.html Peace or War? How early humans behaved] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715062002/http://www.livescience.com/history/060316_peace_violence.html |date=2007-07-15 }}, LiveScience.Com, March 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since violence is a matter of perception as well as a measurable phenomenon, psychologists have found variability in whether people perceive certain physical acts as "violent". For example, in a state where execution is a legalized punishment we do not typically perceive the executioner as "violent", though we may talk, in a more metaphorical way, of the state acting violently. Likewise, understandings of violence are linked to a perceived aggressor-victim relationship: hence psychologists have shown that people may not recognise defensive use of force as violent, even in cases where the amount of force used is significantly greater than in the original aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rowan | first = John | year = 1978 | title = The Structured Crowd | publisher = Davis-Poynter. | title-link = The Structured Crowd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "violent male ape" image is often brought up in discussions of human violence. Dale Peterson and [[Richard Wrangham]]in "Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence" write that violence is inherent in humans, though not inevitable.
However, William L. Ury, editor of a book called "Must We Fight? From the Battlefield to the Schoolyard—A New Perspective on Violent Conflict and Its Prevention" criticizes the "killer ape" myth in his book which brings together discussions from two Harvard Law School symposiums. The conclusion is that "we also have lots of natural mechanisms for cooperation, to keep conflict in check, to channel aggression, and to overcome conflict. These are just as natural to us as the aggressive tendencies."&lt;ref&gt;Cindy Fazzi, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3923/is_200205/ai_n9060833Debunking the "killer ape" myth]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},

The psychiatrist [[James Gilligan]] argues that most violent behavior represents an effort to eliminate feelings of [[shame]] and [[humiliation]], which he calls "the death of self".&lt;ref name="Gilligan 2001"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilligan |first=James |title=Preventing Violence |date=2001 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0-50-077056-6 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books/about/Preventing_Violence.html?id=7_06CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT15 |chapter=Shame and the Death of Self}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilligan 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilligan |first=James |title=Shame, Guilt, and Violence |journal=Social Research |date=2003 |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=1149–1180 |jstor=40971965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of violence often is a source of [[pride]] and a defence of honor, especially among males who believe violence defines manhood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/violence.htm Emotional Competency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323204810/http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/violence.htm |date=2007-03-23 }}; Michael Obsatz,[http://www.angeresources.com/shamebased.html From Shame-Based Masculinity to Holistic Manhood] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201053950/http://angeresources.com/shamebased.html |date=2007-12-01 }}, Robin Morgan, The Demon Lover On the Sexuality of Terrorism, W.W. Norton, 1989, Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article entitled "The History of Violence" in ''[[The New Republic]]'', [[Steven Pinker]] posits that, on average, the amount and cruelty of violence to humans and animals has decreased over the last few centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pinker, [http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2007_03_19_New%20Republic.pdf The History of Violence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127111245/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2007_03_19_New%20Republic.pdf |date=2007-11-27 }}, The New Republic, March 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker's observation of the decline in interpersonal violence echoes the work of [[Norbert Elias]], who attributes the decline to a "civilizing process", in which the state's monopolization of violence, the maintenance of socioeconomic interdependencies or "figurations", and the maintenance of behavioural codes in culture all contribute to the development of individual sensibilities, which increase the repugnance of individuals towards violent acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=CaWFQgAACAAJ | last = Elias | first = N. | year = 1994 | title = The Civilizing Process | location = Oxford | publisher = Blackwell | isbn = 978-0-631-19222-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars disagree with the argument that all violence is decreasing arguing that not all types of violent behaviour are lower now than in the past. They suggest that research typically focuses on lethal violence, often looks at [[homicide]] rates of death due to [[warfare]], but ignore the less obvious forms of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Gorelik, G., Shackelford, T.K., Weekes-Shackelford, V.A., 2012.

(Eds.), The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Perspectives on Violence, Homicide, and War. Oxford University Press, Oxford, pp. 506–524&lt;/ref&gt;  However, non-lethal violence, such as assaults or bullying appear to be declining as well.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelhor, D., Turner, H., Ormrod, R., &amp; Hamby, S.

In his article [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/02/the-coming-anarchy/304670/ "The Coming Anarchy"], Robert D. Kaplan introduces the notion of liberating violence. According to Kaplan, we will observe more violent [[civil war]]s in the future, which will be fought due to economic inequalities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/02/the-coming-anarchy/304670/ "The Coming Anarchy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407054749/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/02/the-coming-anarchy/304670/ |date=2017-04-07 }}, Robert D.

[[Evolutionary psychology]] offers several explanations for human violence in various contexts, such as [[sexual jealousy in humans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Daly Martin |author2=Wilson Margo | year = 1982 | title = Male Sexual Jealousy | url = | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 11–27 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(82)90027-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; child abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Daly Martin |author2=Wilson Margo I | year = 1981 | title = Child Maltreatment from a Sociobiological Perspective | url = | journal = New Directions for Child Development | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 93–112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[homicide]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Margo, and Martin Daly. Homicide. Hawthorne: Aldine de Gruyter, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Goetz (2010) argues that humans are similar to most [[mammal]] species and use violence in specific situations. He writes that "Buss and Shackelford (1997a) proposed seven adaptive problems our ancestors recurrently faced that might have been solved by aggression: co-opting the resources of others, defending against attack, inflicting costs on same-sex rivals, negotiating status and hierarchies, deterring rivals from future aggression, deterring mate from infidelity, and reducing resources expended on genetically unrelated children."&lt;ref name=EP&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goetz | first1 = A. T. | title = The evolutionary psychology of violence | journal = Psicothema | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–21 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20100422 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goetz writes that most [[homicide]]s seem to start from relatively trivial disputes between unrelated men who then escalate to violence and death. He argues that such conflicts occur when there is a status dispute between men of relatively similar status. If there is a great initial status difference, then the lower status individual usually offers no challenge and if challenged the higher status individual usually ignores the lower status individual. At the same an environment of great inequalities between people may cause those at the bottom to use more violence in attempts to gain status.&lt;ref name=EP /&gt;

=== Media ===
{{further|Media violence research}}
Research into the media and violence examines whether links between consuming media violence and subsequent aggressive and violent behaviour exists. Although some scholars had claimed media violence may increase aggression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anderson Craig A. |author2=Berkowitz Leonard |author3=Donnerstein Edward |author4=Huesmann L. Rowell |author5=Johnson James D. |author6=Linz Daniel |author7=Malamuth Neil M. |author8=Wartella Ellen | year = 2003 | title = The Influence of Media Violence on Youth | url = | journal = [[Psychological Science in the Public Interest]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3|pages=81–110 | doi = 10.1111/j.1529-1006.2003.pspi_1433.x | pmid=26151870}}&lt;/ref&gt; this view is coming increasingly in doubt both in the scholarly community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ferguson Christopher J | year = 2010| title = Blazing Angels or Resident Evil? Can Violent Video Games Be a Force for Good? | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2010-11858-003 | journal = [[Review of General Psychology]] | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 68–81 | doi=10.1037/a0018941| citeseerx = 10.1.1.360.3176}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was rejected by the US Supreme Court in the [[Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association|Brown v EMA]] case, as well as in a review of video game violence by the Australian Government (2010) which concluded evidence for harmful effects were inconclusive at best and the rhetoric of some scholars was not matched by good data.

== Prevention ==

The threat and enforcement of physical punishment has been a tried and tested method of preventing some violence since civilisation began.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Code-of-Hammurabi|title=Code of Hammurabi {{!}} Summary &amp; History|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-04-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313150613/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Code-of-Hammurabi|archivedate=2017-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in various degrees in most countries.

=== Interpersonal violence ===
A review of scientific literature by the [[World Health Organization]] on the effectiveness of strategies to prevent interpersonal violence identified the seven strategies below as being supported by either strong or emerging evidence for effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/4th_milestones_meeting/publications/en/ "Violence Prevention: the evidence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830082343/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/4th_milestones_meeting/publications/en/ |date=2012-08-30 }}, World Health Organization/Liverpool John Moores University, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies target risk factors at all four levels of the ecological model.

==== Child–caregiver relationships ====
Among the most effective such programmes to prevent child maltreatment and reduce childhood aggression are the Nurse Family Partnership home-visiting programme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olds DL, Sadler L, Kitzman H | year = 2007| title = Programs for parents of infants and toddlers: recent evidence from randomized trials | url = | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 48| issue = 3–4| pages = 355–391 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2006.01702.x | pmid=17355402}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Triple P (Parenting Program)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Prinz | year = 2009 | title = Population-based prevention of child maltreatment: the US Triple P system population trial | journal = Prevention Science | volume =  10| issue = 1| pages =  1–12| doi = 10.1007/s11121-009-0123-3 | pmid = 19160053 |display-authors=etal| pmc =4258219}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also emerging evidence that these programmes reduce convictions and violent acts in adolescence and early adulthood, and probably help decrease intimate partner violence and self-directed violence in later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Caldera D, etal | year = 2007 | title = Impact of a statewide home visiting program on parenting and on child health and development | url = | journal = Child Abuse and Neglect | volume = 31 | issue = 8| pages = 829–852 | doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2007.02.008| pmid = 17822765 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Caldera | year = 1997 | title = Long-term effects of home visitation on maternal life course and child abuse and neglect: 15 year follow-up of a randomized trial | doi = 10.1001/jama.1997.03550080047038 | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 278 | issue = 8| pages = 637–643 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Life skills in youth ====
Evidence shows that the [[life skills]] acquired in social development programmes can reduce involvement in violence, improve social skills, boost educational achievement and improve job prospects. Life skills refer to social, emotional, and behavioural competencies which help children and adolescents effectively deal with the challenges of everyday life.

==== Gender equality ====
Evaluation studies are beginning to support community interventions that aim to prevent [[violence against women]] by promoting [[gender equality]]. For instance, evidence suggests that programmes that combine microfinance with gender equity training can reduce intimate partner violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Pronyk PM, etal | year = 2006| title = Effect of a structural intervention for the prevention of intimate-partner violence and HIV in rural South Africa: a cluster randomised trial | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 368| issue = 9551| pages = 1973–83 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(06)69744-4 | pmid=17141704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kim JC, Watts CH, Hargreaves JR, etal | year = 2007| title = Understanding the impact of a microfinance-based intervention on women's empowerment and the reduction of intimate partner violence in South Africa | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 97| issue = 10| pages = 1794–1802 | doi=10.2105/ajph.2006.095521 | pmid=17761566 | pmc=1994170}}&lt;/ref&gt; School-based programmes such as Safe Dates programme in the United States of America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Foshee VA, etal | year = 1998| title = An evaluation of safe dates an adolescent dating violence prevention programme | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 1998 | issue = 88| pages = 45–50 | doi=10.2105/ajph.88.1.45| pmc = 1508378 | pmid=9584032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Foshee| year = 2005 | title = Safe Dates" using random coefficient regression modelling | url = | journal = Prevention Science | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 245–257 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Youth Relationship Project in Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Wolfe D, etal | year = 2009 | title = Dating violence prevention with at risk youth: a controlled outcome evaluation | url = | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 71 | issue = 2| pages = 279–291 | doi=10.1037/0022-006x.71.2.279}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been found to be effective for reducing dating violence.

==== Cultural norms ====
Rules or expectations of behaviour – norms – within a cultural or social group can encourage violence. Interventions that challenge cultural and [[social norms]] supportive of violence can prevent acts of violence and have been widely used, but the evidence base for their effectiveness is currently weak. The effectiveness of interventions addressing [[dating violence]] and [[sexual abuse]] among teenagers and young adults by challenging social and cultural norms related to gender is supported by some evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fabiano P | year = 2003 | title = Engaging men as social justice allies in ending violence against women: evidence for a social norms approach | url = | journal = Journal of American College Health | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 105–112 | doi=10.1080/07448480309595732| pmid = 14992295 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce S. The "A Man" campaign: marketing social norms to men to prevent sexual assault. The report on social norms. Working paper number 5. July 2002. Little Falls, NJ, PaperClip Communications, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Support programmes ====
Interventions to identify victims of interpersonal violence and provide effective care and support are critical for protecting health and breaking cycles of violence from one generation to the next. Examples for which evidence of effectiveness is emerging includes: screening tools to identify victims of intimate partner violence and refer them to appropriate services;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Olive P | year = 2007 | title = Care for emergency department patients who have experienced domestic violence: a review of the evidence base | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Nursing | volume = 16 | issue = 9| pages = 1736–1748 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.01746.x| pmid = 17727592 }}&lt;/ref&gt; psychosocial interventions – such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy – to reduce mental health problems associated with violence, including post-traumatic stress disorder;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Roberts GL | year = 1997 | title = Impact of an education program about domestic violence on nurses and doctors in an Australian emergency department | url = | journal = Journal of Emergency Nursing | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 220–226 | doi=10.1016/s0099-1767(97)90011-8|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and protection orders, which prohibit a perpetrator from contacting the victim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Holt VL, etal | year = 2003| title = Do protection orders affect the likelihood of future partner violence and injury? | url = | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 2003 | issue = 24| pages = 16–21 | doi=10.1016/s0749-3797(02)00576-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=McFarlane J, etal | year = 2004| title = Protection orders and intimate partner violence: an 18-month study of 150 Black, Hispanic, and White women | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 2004 | issue = 94| pages = 613–618 | doi=10.2105/ajph.94.4.613| pmc = 1448307 | pmid=15054014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce repeat victimization among victims of intimate partner violence.

=== Collective violence ===
Not surprisingly, scientific evidence about the effectiveness of interventions to prevent collective violence is lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Zwi, Garfield, &amp; Loretti (2002) Collective violence, In Krug et al (Eds) World report on violence and health, WHO&lt;/ref&gt;  However, policies that facilitate [[poverty reduction|reductions in poverty]], that make [[decision-making]] more accountable, that reduce inequalities between groups, as well as policies that reduce access to biological, chemical, nuclear and other weapons have been recommended. When planning responses to violent conflicts, recommended approaches include assessing at an early stage who is most vulnerable and what their needs are, co-ordination of activities between various players and working towards global, national and local capabilities so as to deliver effective health services during the various stages of an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;Zwi, Garfield, &amp; Loretti (2002) Collective violence, In Krug et al (Eds) World report on violence and health&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminal justice ===
One of the main functions of [[law]] is to regulate violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = David Joseph E | year = 2006 | title = The One who is More Violent Prevails – Law and Violence from a Talmudic Legal Perspective | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Law and Jurisprudence | volume = 19 | issue = 2| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Max Weber]] stated that the state claims the [[monopoly of the legitimate use of force]] practised within the confines of a specific territory. [[Law]] enforcement is the main means of regulating nonmilitary violence in society. Governments regulate the use of violence through [[legal system]]s governing individuals and political authorities, including the [[police]] and [[military]]. Civil societies authorize some amount of violence, exercised through the [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]], to maintain the status quo and enforce laws.

However, German political theorist [[Hannah Arendt]] noted: "Violence can be justifiable, but it never will be legitimate ... Its justification loses in plausibility the farther its intended end recedes into the future. No one questions the use of violence in self-defence, because the danger is not only clear but also present, and the end justifying the means is immediate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Arendt | first = Hannah | title = On Violence | publisher = Harvest Book | page = 52 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt made a clear distinction between violence and power. Most political theorists regarded violence as an extreme manifestation of power whereas Arendt regarded the two concepts as opposites.&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, H. (1972) On Violence in Crises in the Republic, Florida, Harcourt, Brace and Company, pp 134-155.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 20th century in acts of [[democide]] governments may have killed more than 260 million of their own people through [[police brutality]], [[execution]], [[massacre]], slave [[labour camps]], and sometimes through intentional [[List of famines#20th century|famine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM|title=20th Century Democide|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301064559/http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM|archivedate=2006-03-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/war-1900.htm|title=Atlas – Wars and Democide of the Twentieth Century|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110130810/http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/war-1900.htm|archivedate=2007-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violent acts that are not carried out by the military or police and that are not in [[self-defense]] are usually classified as [[crimes]], although not all crimes are [[violent crime]]s. [[Property damage|Damage to property]] is classified as violent crime in some jurisdictions but not in all.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) classifies violence resulting in [[homicide]] into [[murder|criminal homicide]] and [[justifiable homicide]] (e.g. self-defense).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/handbook/ucrhandbook04.pdf|title=Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook|year=2004|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503055659/https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/handbook/ucrhandbook04.pdf|archivedate=2015-05-03|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal justice approach sees its main task as enforcing laws that proscribe violence and ensuring that "justice is done". The notions of individual blame, responsibility, guilt, and culpability are central to criminal justice's approach to violence and one of the criminal justice system's main tasks is to "do justice", i.e. to ensure that offenders are properly identified, that the degree of their guilt is as accurately ascertained as possible, and that they are punished appropriately. To prevent and respond to violence, the criminal justice approach relies primarily on deterrence, incarceration and the punishment and rehabilitation of perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;M. Moore "Public Health and Criminal Justice Approaches to Prevention."1992. In Vol. 16 of Crime and Justice: A Review of Research, edited by M. Tonry. Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal justice approach, beyond justice and punishment, has traditionally emphasized indicated interventions, aimed at those who have already been involved in violence, either as victims or as perpetrators. One of the main reasons offenders are arrested, prosecuted, and convicted is to prevent further crimes – through deterrence (threatening potential offenders with criminal sanctions if they commit crimes), incapacitation (physically preventing offenders from committing further crimes by locking them up) and through rehabilitation (using time spent under state supervision to develop skills or change one's psychological make-up to reduce the likelihood of future offences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Prothrow-Stith D | year = 2004 | title = Strengthening the collaboration between public health and criminal justice to prevent violence | url = | journal = Journal of Law, Medicine, and Ethics | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 82–94 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.2004.tb00451.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades in many countries in the world, the criminal justice system has taken an increasing interest in preventing violence before it occurs. For instance, much of community and [[problem-oriented policing]] aims to reduce crime and violence by altering the conditions that foster it – and not to increase the number of arrests. Indeed, some police leaders have gone so far as to say the police should primarily be a crime prevention agency.&lt;ref&gt;Bratton W (with Knobler P). Turnaround: how America's top cop reversed the crime epidemic. New York: Random House, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenile justice systems – an important component of criminal justice systems – are largely based on the belief in rehabilitation and prevention. In the US, the criminal justice system has, for instance, funded school- and community-based initiatives to reduce children's access to guns and teach conflict resolution. In 1974, the US Department of Justice assumed primary responsibility for delinquency prevention programmes and created the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, which has supported the "Blueprints for violence prevention" programme at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]].&lt;ref&gt;Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence [http://www.colorado.edu/cspv/blueprints "Blueprints for violence prevention/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103080341/http://www.colorado.edu/cspv/blueprints/ |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public health ===
The public health approach is a science-driven, population-based, interdisciplinary, intersectoral approach based on the ecological model which emphasizes primary prevention.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt; Rather than focusing on individuals, the public health approach aims to provide the maximum benefit for the largest number of people, and to extend better care and safety to entire populations. The public health approach is interdisciplinary, drawing upon knowledge from many disciplines including medicine, epidemiology, sociology, psychology, criminology, education and economics. Because all forms of violence are multi-faceted problems, the public health approach emphasizes a multi-sectoral response. It has been proved time and again that cooperative efforts from such diverse sectors as health, education, social welfare, and criminal justice are often necessary to solve what are usually assumed to be purely "criminal" or "medical" problems. The public health approach considers that violence, rather than being the result of any single factor, is the outcome of multiple risk factors and causes, interacting at four levels of a nested hierarchy (individual, close relationship/family, community and wider society) of the [[Social ecological model]].

From a public health perspective, prevention strategies can be classified into three types:
* Primary prevention – approaches that aim to prevent violence before it occurs.
* Secondary prevention – approaches that focus on the more immediate responses to violence, such as pre-hospital care, emergency services or treatment for sexually transmitted infections following a rape.
* Tertiary prevention – approaches that focus on long-term care in the wake of violence, such as rehabilitation and reintegration, and attempt to lessen trauma or reduce long-term disability associated with violence.

A public health approach emphasizes the primary prevention of violence, i.e. stopping them from occurring in the first place. Until recently, this approach has been relatively neglected in the field, with the majority of resources directed towards secondary or tertiary prevention. Perhaps the most critical element of a public health approach to prevention is the ability to identify underlying causes rather than focusing upon more visible "symptoms". This allows for the development and testing of effective approaches to address the underlying causes and so improve health.

The public health approach is an evidence-based and systematic process involving the following four steps:
# Defining the problem conceptually and numerically, using statistics that accurately describe the nature and scale of violence, the characteristics of those most affected, the geographical distribution of incidents, and the consequences of exposure to such violence.
# Investigating why the problem occurs by determining its causes and correlates, the factors that increase or decrease the risk of its occurrence (risk and protective factors) and the factors that might be modifiable through intervention.
# Exploring ways to prevent the problem by using the above information and designing, monitoring and rigorously assessing the effectiveness of programmes through outcome evaluations.
# Disseminating information on the effectiveness of programmes and increasing the scale of proven effective programmes. Approaches to prevent violence, whether targeted at individuals or entire communities, must be properly evaluated for their effectiveness and the results shared. This step also includes adapting programmes to local contexts and subjecting them to rigorous re-evaluation to ensure their effectiveness in the new setting.

In many countries, violence prevention is still a new or emerging field in public health. The public health community has started only recently to realize the contributions it can make to reducing violence and mitigating its consequences. In 1949, Gordon called for injury prevention efforts to be based on the understanding of causes, in a similar way to prevention efforts for communicable and other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon JE, "The epidemiology of accidents," ''American Journal of Public Health'', 1949; 504–15.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Gomez, referring to the WHO definition of health, stated that it is obvious that violence does not contribute to "extending life" or to a "complete state of well-being". He defined violence as an issue that public health experts needed to address and stated that it should not be the primary domain of lawyers, military personnel, or politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Abad Gomez H | year = 1962 | title = Violence requires epidemiological studies | url = | journal = Tribuna Medica | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 1–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is only in the last 30 years that public health has begun to address violence, and only in the last fifteen has it done so at the global level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dahlberg L. |author2=Mercy J. | year = 2009 | title = History of violence as a public health issue | url = | journal = AMA Virtual Mentor | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 167–172 | doi=10.1001/virtualmentor.2009.11.2.mhst1-0902|pmid=23190546 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a much shorter period of time than public health has been tackling other health problems of comparable magnitude and with similarly severe lifelong consequences.

The global public health response to interpersonal violence began in earnest in the mid-1990s. In 1996, the World Health Assembly adopted Resolution WHA49.25&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/resources/publications/en/WHA4925_eng.pdf "WHA49.25 Prevention of violence: a public health priority"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122193242/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/resources/publications/en/WHA4925_eng.pdf |date=2013-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which declared violence "a leading worldwide public health problem" and requested that the World Health Organization (WHO) initiate public health activities to (1) document and characterize the burden of violence, (2) assess the effectiveness of programmes, with particular attention to women and children and community-based initiatives, and (3) promote activities to tackle the problem at the international and national levels. The World Health Organization's initial response to this resolution was to create the Department of Violence and Injury Prevention and Disability and to publish the World report on violence and health (2002).&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

The case for the public health sector addressing interpersonal violence rests on four main arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Prothrow-Stith D | year = 2004 | title = Strengthening the collaboration between public health and criminal justice to prevent violence | url = | journal = Journal of Law, Medicine, and Ethics | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 82–88 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.2004.tb00451.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the significant amount of time health care professionals dedicate to caring for victims and perpetrators of violence has made them familiar with the problem and has led many, particularly in emergency departments, to mobilize to address it. The information, resources, and infrastructures the health care sector has at its disposal are an important asset for research and prevention work. Second, the magnitude of the problem and its potentially severe lifelong consequences and high costs to individuals and wider society call for population-level interventions typical of the public health approach. Third, the criminal justice approach, the other main approach to addressing violence (link to entry above), has traditionally been more geared towards violence that occurs between male youths and adults in the street and other public places – which makes up the bulk of homicides in most countries – than towards violence occurring in private settings such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence and elder abuse – which makes up the largest share of non-fatal violence. Fourth, evidence is beginning to accumulate that a science-based public health approach is effective at preventing interpersonal violence.

=== Human rights ===
[[File:Abdulredha Buhmaid on floor.jpeg|thumb|[[Bahrain]]'s pro-democracy protesters killed by military, February 2011]]
The [[human rights]] approach is based on the obligations of states to respect, protect and fulfill human rights and therefore to prevent, eradicate and punish violence. It recognizes violence as a violation of many human rights: the rights to life, liberty, [[autonomy]] and security of the person; the rights to equality and non-discrimination; the rights to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment; the right to [[privacy]]; and the [[right to health|right to the highest attainable standard of health]]. These human rights are enshrined in [[international human rights law|international and regional treaties]] and national constitutions and laws, which stipulate the obligations of states, and include mechanisms to hold states accountable. The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], for example, requires that countries party to the Convention take all appropriate steps to end violence against women. The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] in its Article 19 states that States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]], while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.

=== Geographical context ===
Violence, as defined in the dictionary of human geography, "appears whenever power is in jeopardy" and "in and of itself stands emptied of strength and purpose: it is part of a larger matrix of socio-political power struggles".&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009"&gt;Hyndman, J. (2009) Violence in Gregory, D., Johnston, R., Pratt, G., Watts, M. and Whatmore, S. eds. Dictionary of Human Geography, Wiley-Blackwell, NJ: 798-799.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence can be broadly divided into three broad categories – direct violence, structural violence and cultural violence.&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009" /&gt; Thus defined and delineated, it is of note, as Hyndman says, that "geography came late to theorizing violence"&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009" /&gt; in comparison to other social sciences. Social and human geography, rooted in the [[Humanism|humanist]], [[Marxist]], and [[Feminist theory|feminist]] subfields that emerged following the early positivist approaches and subsequent behavioral turn, have long been concerned with social and spatial justice.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, S. (2001) Social Geography, in Smelser, N. and Baltes, P. eds. International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences, Oxford, Elsevier, 14293-14299.&lt;/ref&gt;
Along with critical geographers and political geographers, it is these groupings of geographers that most often interact with violence. Keeping this idea of social/spatial justice via geography in mind, it is worthwhile to look at geographical approaches to violence in the context of politics.

Derek Gregory and Alan Pred assembled the influential edited collection ''Violent Geographies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence'', which demonstrates how place, space, and landscape are foremost factors in the real and imagined practices of organized violence both historically and in the present.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Derek and Pred, Alan'', 2006 Violent Geographies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently, political violence often gives a part for the state to play. When "modern states not only claim a monopoly of the legitimate means of violence; they also routinely use the threat of violence to enforce the rule of law",&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009" /&gt; the law not only becomes a form of violence but is violence.&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009" /&gt; Philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]]'s concepts of [[state of exception]] and ''[[homo sacer]]'' are useful to consider within a geography of violence. The state, in the grip of a perceived, potential crisis (whether legitimate or not) takes preventative legal measures, such as a suspension of rights (it is in this climate, as Agamben demonstrates, that the formation of the Social Democratic and Nazi government's lager or concentration camp can occur). However, when this "in limbo" reality is designed to be in place "until further notice…the state of exception thus ceases to be referred to as an external and provisional state of factual danger and comes to be confused with juridical rule itself".&lt;ref name="Agamben, G. 1998"&gt;Agamben, G. (1998) ''Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life'', Stanford University Press, Stanford.&lt;/ref&gt; For Agamben, the physical space of the camp "is a piece of land placed outside the normal juridical order, but it is nevertheless not simply an external space".&lt;ref name="Agamben, G. 1998" /&gt; At the scale of the body, in the state of exception, a person is so removed from their rights by "juridical procedures and deployments of power"&lt;ref name="Agamben, G. 1998" /&gt; that "no act committed against them could appear any longer as a crime";&lt;ref name="Agamben, G. 1998" /&gt; in other words, people become only ''homo sacer''. [[Guantanamo Bay]] could also be said to represent the physicality of the state of exception in space, and can just as easily draw man as homo sacer.

In the 1970s, genocides in Cambodia under the [[Khmer Rouge]] and [[Pol Pot]] resulted in the deaths of over two million Cambodians (which was 25% of the Cambodian population), forming one of the many contemporary examples of state-sponsored violence.&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002"&gt;Ringer, G. (2002) "Killing Fields", in Christensen, K. and Levinson, D. eds. ''Encyclopedia of Modern Asia'', Charles Scribner's Sons, New York: 368-370.&lt;/ref&gt; About fourteen thousand of these murders occurred at [[Choeung Ek]], which is the best-known of the extermination camps referred to as the [[Killing Fields]].&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002" /&gt; The killings were arbitrary; for example, a person could be killed for wearing glasses, since that was seen as associating them with intellectuals and therefore as making them part of the enemy. People were murdered with impunity because it was no crime; Cambodians were made ''homo sacer'' in a condition of bare life. The Killing Fields—manifestations of Agamben's concept of camps beyond the normal rule of law—featured the state of exception. As part of Pol Pot's "ideological intent…to create a purely agrarian society or cooperative",&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002" /&gt; he "dismantled the country's existing economic infrastructure and depopulated every urban area".&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002" /&gt; Forced movement, such as this forced movement applied by Pol Pot, is a clear display of structural violence. When "symbols of Cambodian society were equally disrupted, social institutions of every kind…were purged or torn down",&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002" /&gt; cultural violence (defined as when "any aspect of culture such as language, religion, ideology, art, or cosmology is used to legitimize direct or structural violence"&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009" /&gt;) is added to the structural violence of forced movement and to the direct violence, such as murder, at the Killing Fields. Vietnam eventually intervened and the genocide officially ended. However, ten million landmines left by opposing guerillas in the 1970s&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002" /&gt; continue to create a violent landscape in Cambodia.

Human geography, though coming late to the theorizing table, has tackled violence through many lenses, including anarchist geography, feminist geography, Marxist geography, political geography, and critical geography. However, [[Adriana Cavarero]] notes that, "as violence spreads and assumes unheard-of forms, it becomes difficult to name in contemporary language".&lt;ref name="Cavarero, A. 2009"&gt;Cavarero, A. (2009) ''Horrorism: Naming Contemporary Violence'', Columbia University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Cavarero proposes that, in facing such a truth, it is prudent to reconsider violence as "horrorism"; that is, "as though ideally all the…victims, instead of their killers, ought to determine the name".&lt;ref name="Cavarero, A. 2009" /&gt; With geography often adding the forgotten spatial aspect to theories of social science, rather than creating them solely within the discipline, it seems that the self-reflexive contemporary geography of today may have an extremely important place in this current (re)imaging of violence, exemplified by Cavarero.{{clarify|date=November 2014}}

== Epidemiology ==
[[File:No Violence Sign.jpg|thumb|A sign that calls to stop violence]]
As of 2010, all forms of violence resulted in about 1.34 million deaths up from about 1 million in 1990.&lt;ref name=Loz2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lozano|first=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=Dec 15, 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095–128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0|first2=M|last3=Foreman|first3=K|last4=Lim|first4=S|last5=Shibuya|first5=K|last6=Aboyans|first6=V|last7=Abraham|first7=J|last8=Adair|first8=T|last9=Aggarwal|first9=R|last10=Ahn|first10=SY|last11=Alvarado|first11=M|last12=Anderson|first12=HR|last13=Anderson|first13=LM|last14=Andrews|first14=KG|last15=Atkinson|first15=C|last16=Baddour|first16=LM|last17=Barker-Collo|first17=S|last18=Bartels|first18=DH|last19=Bell|first19=ML|last20=Benjamin|first20=EJ|last21=Bennett|first21=D|last22=Bhalla|first22=K|last23=Bikbov|first23=B|last24=Bin Abdulhak|first24=A|last25=Birbeck|first25=G|last26=Blyth|first26=F|last27=Bolliger|first27=I|last28=Boufous|first28=S|last29=Bucello|first29=C|last30=Burch|first30=M|last2=Naghavi|display-authors=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suicide]] accounts for about 883,000, interpersonal violence for 456,000 and collective violence for 18,000.&lt;ref name=Loz2012 /&gt; Deaths due to collective violence have decreased from 64,000 in 1990.&lt;ref name=Loz2012 /&gt;

By way of comparison, the 1.5 millions deaths a year due to violence is greater than the number of deaths due to tuberculosis (1.34 million), road traffic injuries (1.21 million), and malaria (830'000), but slightly less than the number of people who die from HIV/AIDS (1.77 million).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html "Global Burden of Disease, Disease and injury regional estimates"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224055121/http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html |date=2010-12-24 }}, World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

For every death due to violence, there are numerous nonfatal injuries. In 2008, over 16 million cases of non-fatal violence-related injuries were severe enough to require medical attention. Beyond deaths and injuries, forms of violence such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and elder maltreatment have been found to be highly prevalent.

=== Self-directed violence ===
In the last 45 years, suicide rates have increased by 60% worldwide.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Suicide is among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15–44 years in some countries, and the second leading cause of death in the 10–24 years age group.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} These figures do not include suicide attempts which are up to 20 times more frequent than completed suicide.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Suicide was the 16th leading cause of death worldwide in 2004 and is projected to increase to the 12th in 2030.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/EN_WHS08_Full.pdf "World Health Statistics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030212923/http://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/EN_WHS08_Full.pdf |date=2011-10-30 }} World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Although suicide rates have traditionally been highest among the male elderly, rates among young people have been increasing to such an extent that they are now the group at highest risk in a third of countries, in both developed and developing countries.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Interpersonal violence ===
Rates and patterns of violent death vary by country and region. In recent years, homicide rates have been highest in developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean and lowest in East Asia, the western Pacific, and some countries in northern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html "Global Burden of Disease"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224055121/http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html |date=2010-12-24 }}, World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show a strong, inverse relationship between homicide rates and both economic development and economic equality. Poorer countries, especially those with large gaps between the rich and the poor, tend to have higher rates of homicide than wealthier countries. Homicide rates differ markedly by age and sex. Gender differences are least marked for children. For the 15 to 29 age group, male rates were nearly six times those for female rates; for the remaining age groups, male rates were from two to four times those for females.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg ML, Butchart A, Mercy J, Narasimhan V, Waters H, Marshall MS. Interpersonal violence. In Jamison DT, Breman JG, Measham AR, Alleyne G, Claeson M, Evans DB, Prabhat J, Mills A, Musgrove P (eds.) Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, 2nd Edition. Washington, D.C.: Oxford University Press and The World Bank, 2006: 755-770.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in a number of countries show that, for every homicide among young people age 10 to 24, 20 to 40 other young people receive hospital treatment for a violent injury.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

Forms of violence such as child maltreatment and intimate partner violence are highly prevalent. Approximately 20% of women and 5–10% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25–50% of all children report being physically abused.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs150/en/index.html "Child maltreatment"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229124411/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs150/en/index.html |date=2011-12-29 }}, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A WHO multi-country study found that between 15–71% of women reported experiencing physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner at some point in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/index.html "Violence against women"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228151643/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/index.html |date=2011-12-28 }}, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collective violence ===
Wars grab headlines, but the individual risk of dying violently in an armed conflict is today relatively low—much lower than the risk of violent death in many countries that are not suffering from an armed conflict. For example, between 1976 and 2008, [[African American]]s were victims of 329,825 homicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homicide trends in the United States |publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics |url=http://www1.cj.msu.edu/~outreach/mvaa/Homicide/Homicide%20Trends%20in%20the%20United%20States.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010151657/http://www.cj.msu.edu/~outreach/mvaa/Homicide/Homicide%20Trends%20in%20the%20United%20States.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homicide Victims by Race and Sex |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/law_enforcement_courts_prisons/crimes_and_crime_rates.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323173400/http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/law_enforcement_courts_prisons/crimes_and_crime_rates.html |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is a widespread perception that war is the most dangerous form of armed violence in the world, the average person living in a conflict-affected country had a risk of dying violently in the conflict of about 2.0 per 100,000 population between 2004 and 2007. This can be compared to the average world homicide rate of 7.6 per 100,000 people. This illustration highlights the value of accounting for all forms of armed violence rather than an exclusive focus on conflict related violence. Certainly, there are huge variations in the risk of dying from armed conflict at the national and subnational level, and the risk of dying violently in a conflict in specific countries remains extremely high. In Iraq, for example, the direct conflict death rate for 2004–07 was 65 per 100,000 people per year and, in Somalia, 24 per 100,000 people. This rate even reached peaks of 91 per 100,000 in Iraq in 2006 and 74 per 100,000 in Somalia in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Krause, Robert Muggah, and Achim Wennmann, "Global Burden of Armed Violence," Geneva Declaration Secretariat, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fry]] writes that scholars are divided on the origins of this greater degree of violence—in other words, war-like behavior: {{quote|There are basically two schools of thought on this issue. One holds that warfare... goes back at least to the time of the first thoroughly modern humans and even before then to the primate ancestors of the hominid lineage. The second positions on the origins of warfare sees war as much less common in the cultural and biological evolution of humans. Here, warfare is a latecomer on the cultural horizon, only arising in very specific material circumstances and being quite rare in human history until the development of agriculture in the past 10,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fry, Douglas P.|title=War, Peace, and Human Nature: The Convergence of Evolutionary and Cultural Views|page=168|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8eJoAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22one+of+the+critical+issues%22|isbn=978-0-19-985900-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jared Diamond]] in his books ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel]]'' and ''[[The Third Chimpanzee]]'' posits that the rise of large-scale warfare is the result of advances in technology and city-states. For instance, the rise of agriculture provided a significant increase in the number of individuals that a region could sustain over hunter-gatherer societies, allowing for development of specialized classes such as soldiers, or weapons manufacturers.

In academia, the idea of the peaceful pre-history and non-violent tribal societies gained popularity with the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial perspective]]. The trend, starting in [[archaeology]] and spreading to [[anthropology]] reached its height in the late half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Keely1&gt;Keeley, Lawrence H. War before Civilization. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some newer research in archaeology and [[bioarchaeology]] may provide evidence that violence within and among groups is not a recent phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The fraud of primitive authenticity|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/HG04Aa02.html|accessdate=16 July 2013|newspaper=[[Asia Times Online]]|date=4 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=October 2014}} According to the book "The Bioarchaeology of Violence" violence is a behavior that is found throughout human history.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Debra L., Ryan P.

Lawrence H. Keeley at the University of Illinois writes in ''[[War Before Civilization]]'' that 87% of [[tribal societies]] were at war more than once per year, and that 65% of them were fighting continuously. He writes that the attrition rate of numerous close-quarter clashes, which characterize [[endemic warfare]], produces casualty rates of up to 60%, compared to 1% of the combatants as is typical in modern warfare. "Primitive Warfare" of these small groups or tribes was driven by the basic need for sustenance and violent competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.troynovant.com/Franson/Keeley/War-Before-Civilization.html Review of book "War Before Civilization" by Lawrence H. Keeley] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514081056/http://www.troynovant.com/Franson/Keeley/War-Before-Civilization.html |date=2008-05-14 }}, July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fry explores Keeley's argument in depth and counters that such sources erroneously focus on the ethnography of hunters and gatherers in the present, whose culture and values have been infiltrated externally by modern civilization, rather than the actual archaeological record spanning some two million years of human existence. Fry determines that all present ethnographically studied tribal societies, "by the very fact of having been described and published by anthropologists, have been irrevocably impacted by history and modern colonial nation states" and that "many have been affected by state societies for at least 5000 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fry, Douglas P.|title=War, Peace, and Human Nature: The Convergence of Evolutionary and Cultural Views|pages=171–3|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Better Angels of Our Nature'' ===
[[Steven Pinker]]'s 2011 book, ''[[The Better Angels of Our Nature]]'', roused both acclaim and controversy by asserting that modern society is less violent than in periods of the past, whether on the short scale of decades or long scale of centuries or millennia.

Steven Pinker argues that by every possible measure, every type of violence has drastically decreased since ancient and medieval times. A few centuries ago, for example, [[genocide]] was a standard practice in all kinds of warfare and was so common that historians did not even bother to mention it. According to Pinker, rape, murder, warfare and animal cruelty have all seen drastic declines in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Pinker&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Steven Pinker]] |title=The Better Angels of Our Nature |isbn=978-0-670-02295-3|year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pinker's analyses have met with much criticism;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=bookreview-steven-pinker-the-better-angels-of-our-nature-why-violence-has-declined |title=Book Review |author=R Epstein |publisher=Scientific American |date=October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914140139/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=bookreview-steven-pinker-the-better-angels-of-our-nature-why-violence-has-declined |archivedate=2016-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laws"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=702 |title=Against Pinker's Violence |first=Ben |last=Laws |journal=[[Ctheory]] |date=21 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512052358/http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=702 |archivedate=12 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Herman Edward S. | author2 = Peterson David | year =  | title = Steven Pinker on the alleged decline of violence | url = http://isreview.org/issue/86/steven-pinker-alleged-decline-violence | journal = International Socialist Review | volume = 86 | issue =  | page =  | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150319022936/http://isreview.org/issue/86/steven-pinker-alleged-decline-violence | archivedate = 2015-03-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/12/03/the_big_kill?page=full |title=The Big Kill – By John Arquilla |publisher=Foreign Policy |date=2012-12-03 |accessdate=2013-01-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107171044/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/12/03/the_big_kill?page=full |archivedate=2013-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, Pinker himself, on his FAQ page, states that he does not include catastrophic ecological violence (including violence against wild or domesticated non-human animals or plants, or against ecosystems) or the violence of economic inequality and of coercive working conditions in his definition; he controversially regards these forms of violence as "metaphorical". Some critics have therefore argued that Pinker suffers from "a reductive vision of what it means to be violent."&lt;ref name="Laws" /&gt;

== Society and culture ==

[[File:PikiWiki Israel 20285 quot;Stop Violencequot; sculpture in Petah Tikva.JPG|thumb|right|A sculpture in [[Petah Tikva, Israel]] of a padlock on the warped barrel of a [[semi-automatic pistol]], with the inscription "stop violence!" in ({{lang-he|!די לאלימות}})]]

Beyond deaths and injuries, highly prevalent forms of violence (such as child maltreatment and intimate partner violence) have serious lifelong non-injury health consequences. Victims may engage in high-risk behaviours such as alcohol and substance misuse and smoking, which in turn can contribute to cardiovascular disorders, cancers, depression, diabetes and HIV/AIDS, resulting in premature death&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ace/index.htm "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170920185014/https://www.cdc.gov/ace/index.htm |date=2017-09-20 }}, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eye for an eye|Violence may beget violence]]. The balances of prevention, mitigation, mediation and exacerbation are complex, and vary with the underpinnings of violence.

=== Economic effects ===
In countries with high levels of violence, economic growth can be slowed down, personal and collective security eroded, and social development impeded. Families edging out of poverty and investing in schooling their sons and daughters can be ruined through the violent death or severe disability of the main breadwinner. Communities can be caught in poverty traps where pervasive violence and deprivation form a vicious circle that stifles economic growth. For societies, meeting the direct costs of health, criminal justice, and social welfare responses to violence diverts many billions of dollars from more constructive societal spending. The much larger indirect costs of violence due to lost productivity and lost investment in education work together to slow economic development, increase socioeconomic inequality, and erode human and social capital.

Additionally, communities with high level of violence do not provide the level of stability and predictability vital for a prospering business economy. Individuals will be less likely to invest money and effort towards growth in such unstable and violent conditions.

In 2016, the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]], released the [http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/02/The-Economic-Value-of-Peace-2016-WEB.pdf Economic Value of Peace] report, which estimates the economic impact of violence and conflict on the global economy, the total economic impact of violence on the world economy in 2015 was estimated to be $13.6 trillion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/how-much-does-violence-really-cost-our-global-economy/|title=How much does violence really cost our global economy?|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2017-06-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913201606/https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/how-much-does-violence-really-cost-our-global-economy|archivedate=2017-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[purchasing power parity]] terms.

Religious and political ideologies have been the cause of interpersonal violence throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;"Doctrinal War: Religion and Ideology in International Conflict," in Bruce Kuklick (advisory ed.), ''The Monist: The Foundations of International Order'', Vol. 89, No. 2 (April 2006), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Ideologues often falsely accuse others of violence, such as the ancient [[blood libel]] against Jews, the [[medieval]] accusations of casting [[witchcraft]] spells against women, and modern accusations of [[satanic ritual abuse]] against day care center owners and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/ra_case.htm 42 M.V.M.O.

Vittorio Bufacchi describes two different modern concepts of violence, one the "minimalist conception" of violence as an intentional act of excessive or destructive force, the other the "comprehensive conception" which includes violations of rights, including a long list of human needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1478-9299.2005.00023.x|pages=193–204|title=Two Concepts of Violence|journal=Political Studies Review|volume=3|issue=2|year=2005|last1=Bufacchi|first1=Vittorio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-capitalist]]s assert that [[capitalism]] is violent. They believe [[private property]] and [[Profit (economics)|profit]] survive only because police violence defends them and that capitalist economies need war to expand.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Albert [https://web.archive.org/web/20050312224037/http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?ItemID=6842 Life After Capitalism – And Now Too].

Throughout history, most religions and individuals like [[Mahatma Gandhi]] have preached that humans are capable of eliminating individual violence and organizing societies through purely [[nonviolent]] means. Gandhi himself once wrote: "A society organized and run on the basis of complete non-violence would be the purest [[anarchy]]."&lt;ref&gt;Bharatan Kumarappa, Editor, "For Pacifists," by M.K. Gandhi, Navajivan Publishing House, Ahmedabad, India, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern political ideologies which espouse similar views include pacifist varieties of [[Voluntaryism|voluntarism]], [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], [[anarchism]] and [[libertarianism]].

Terence Fretheim writing about the Old Testament:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

For many people, ... only physical violence truly qualifies as violence. But, certainly, violence is more than killing people, unless one includes all those words and actions that kill people slowly. The effect of limitation to a “killing fields” perspective is the widespread neglect of many other forms of violence. We must insist that violence also refers to that which is psychologically destructive, that which demeans, damages, or depersonalizes others.  In view of these considerations, violence may be defined as follows: any action, verbal or nonverbal, oral or written, physical or psychical, active or passive, public or private, individual or institutional/societal, human or divine, in whatever degree of intensity, that abuses, violates, injures, or kills. Some of the most pervasive and most dangerous forms of violence are those that are often hidden from view (against women and children, especially); just beneath the surface in many of our homes, churches, and communities is abuse enough to freeze the
blood. Moreover, many forms of systemic violence often slip past our attention because they are so much a part of the infrastructure of life (e.g., racism, sexism, ageism).&lt;ref name=Fretheim&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Word &amp; World |first=Terence |last=Freitheim |title=God and Violence in the Old Testament |volume=24 |issue=1 |date=Winter 2004 |url=http://wordandworld.luthersem.edu/content/pdfs/24-1_Violence/24-1_Fretheim.pdf |accessdate=2010-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119093532/http://wordandworld.luthersem.edu/content/pdfs/24-1_Violence/24-1_Fretheim.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Stark''' (April 1, 1724&amp;nbsp;– August 27, 1776) was a [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] era officer. He was the brother of celebrated Revolutionary war hero [[John Stark]].

==Early life==
Stark was born in [[Londonderry, New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parker|first=Edward Lutwyche|title=The History of Londonderry, Comprising the Towns of Derry and Londonderry, N. H.|year=1851|publisher=Perkins and Whipple|page=96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8H-YOoZSdCMC&amp;pg=PA96 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He was with his brother [[John Stark]], David Stinson and Amos Eastman, hunting along the [[Baker River (New Hampshire)|Baker River]], a tributary of the [[Pemigewasset River]], on 28 April 1752, when John Stark and Amos Eastman were captured and David Stinson was killed by [[Abenaki]] Indians. William escaped in his [[canoe]] after being warned by his brother.

==Career==
During the [[French and Indian War]] Stark commanded a company of [[Rogers' Rangers]] in northern [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Nova Scotia]] where he served under [[James Rogers (soldier)|James Rogers]]. He took part in the assaults on [[Fortress Louisbourg]] in 1758, the [[St. John River Campaign]] and [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] in 1759. Early in the [[American Revolution]], Stark did not join the [[New Hampshire Militia]] forces in the [[Siege of Boston]], but the sounds of the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] could be heard at his home in [[Dunbarton, New Hampshire]], and he left on his swiftest horse to fight, but he arrived too late and the battle had already ended.

Both General [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] and Colonel [[Jonathan Moulton]] recommended Stark to command the new regiment being raised in [[New Hampshire]] for service with the [[Continental Army]] in the [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invasion of Canada]], but the New Hampshire General Assembly gave the command to [[Timothy Bedel]], a former subordinate of Stark's. Stark, feeling ill-used by his home state, left for [[New York City]], which was occupied by the [[British Army]], and offered his services to them. The [[British Empire|British]] made him a lieutenant colonel of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stark|first=William|title=The Loyalist Refugees of New Hampshire, Issue 3|publisher=Ohio State University, 1916|pages=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0JCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stark's property in New Hampshire was confiscated by the revolutionary government.

==Death==
Stark died from injuries he received in falling from his [[horse]] in [[Long Island, New York]] during the [[Battle of Long Island]] on August 27, 1776.

Notes from Debbie Carr record that: "According to an "Abstract of Graves of Revolutionary Patriots about William Stark" he is buried in: Lyme Plain Cemeter in Lyme, Grafton County, New Hampshire 29I".

==Personal life==
Stark was the son of Archibald and Eleanor Nichols Stark and the older brother of General [[John Stark]], the hero of the [[Battle of Bennington]]. He married Mary Stinson on February 22, 1754 and they had seven children: William JR., John, Archibald, Mary, Stephen, Thomas, and James.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William Stark|url=http://www.nh.searchroots.com/HillsboroughCo/Manchester/stark.html|publisher=History and Genealogy of Manchester, Hillsborough County, New Hampshire|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
