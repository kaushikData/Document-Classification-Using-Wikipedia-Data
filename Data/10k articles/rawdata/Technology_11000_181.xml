      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1116">A '''Bitstream''' or '''1-bit DAC''' is a [[consumer electronics]] marketing term describing an [[oversampling]] [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC) with an ''actual'' 1-bit DAC (that is, a simple "on/off" switch) in a [[Delta-sigma modulation|delta-sigma]] loop operating at multiples of the [[sampling frequency]].  The combination is equivalent to a DAC with a larger number of bits (usually 16-20).
The advantages of this type of converter are high linearity combined with low cost, owed to the fact that most of the processing takes place in the digital domain and requirements for the analog anti-aliasing filter after the output can be relaxed.  For these reasons, this design is very popular in digital consumer electronics (CD/DVD players, set-top boxes and the like).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Steven W., ''The Scientist’s and Engineer’s Guide to Digital Signal Processing'' (Second Edition).

[[File:F-16CM 2030 Turku Airshow 2015 04 pylon.JPG|thumb|ALE-50 towed decoy system in the upper part of a [[F-16 Falcon]] wing pylon]]
The '''AN/ALE-50 towed decoy system''' was developed by [[Raytheon]] to protect multiple US military aircraft from [[Missile_guidance#Active_homing|radar-guided missiles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deagel.com/Aircraft-Protection-Systems/ANALE-50_a001668001.aspx Deagel Article]&lt;/ref&gt; The AN/ALE-50 towed decoy system is an anti-missile [[Radar jamming and deception|countermeasures decoy system]] used on multiple U.S. [[U.S. Air Force|Air Force]], [[U.S. Navy|Navy]], and [[U.S. Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] aircraft, and by certain non-United States air forces. The system is manufactured by [[Raytheon]] Space and Airborne Systems at its facility in [[Goleta, California]]. The ALE-50 system consists of a launcher and launch controller installed on the aircraft (usually on a wing pylon), and one or more expendable towed [[decoy]]s. Each decoy is delivered in a sealed canister and has a ten-year [[shelf life]].

When deployed, the decoy is towed behind the host aircraft, protecting the aircraft and its crew against RF-guided [[missiles]] by luring the missile toward the decoy and away from the intended target. In both flight tests and actual combat, the ALE-50 has successfully countered numerous live firings of both surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles. U.S. military pilots have nicknamed the decoy "Little Buddy".

The ALE-50 was first deployed in 1995, but is also used on the [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]] and the [[B-1 Lancer|B-1B Lancer]]. The ALE-50 has also been integrated into the next-generation [[List of military electronics of the United States|ALQ-184(V)9]] [[Electronic countermeasures|ECM]] pod, creating an integrated threat-protection system that can be carried on a larger number of platforms.

The ALE-50 expendable decoys’ estimated value is $22,000 each. The latest production run of 1,048 units will be delivering through October 2010.&lt;ref name="example"&gt;[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/raytheons-ale50-little-buddy-decoys-02573/#more-2573  Defense Industry Daily Article]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ALE-50 towed decoy has provided combat-proven aircraft protection against RF missile threats in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Featuring low acquisition and life-cycle cost, the system adaptability enables installation and operation on virtually any airborne platform. The ALE-50 towed decoy is currently operational on the F-16, F/A-18E/F, and B-1B aircraft.&lt;ref name="example2"&gt;[http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/ale50/ Raytheon Product Information Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''accessaphone''', first introduced in 2005 is CTI ([[Computer Telephony Integration]]) enabled software that provides better user access to desk and soft phones via the keyboard, mouse and/or voice commands. The application is specifically useful for users with various vision and mobility abilities.

==How  it is used==
As an example, when using an enterprise phone from [[Cisco]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac227/csr2008/the-environment/environmentally-responsible-products/accessibility-for-all.html?internalid=ACA|title=Cisco: Accessibility for All}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[NEC]] or [[Tadiran Telecom]], functions like Dial, Hold and Transfer can be executed via keyboard hot keys D, H and T (preceded with the ALT key) respectively. accessaphone uses [[Microsoft Windows]] [[Telephony Application Programming Interface]] (TAPI) to communicate with the Enterprise Phone System.

==Accessibility Compliance==
One of the ways in which accessaphone makes phone systems accessible and [[Section 508]] compliant is by providing Audible Caller ID. This is a requirement on the [[Voluntary Product Accessibility Template]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/web/about/responsibility/accessibility/legal_regulatory/vpats.html |title=Cisco Voluntary Product Accessibility Template - Section 1194.23(e)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is specifically useful for users with vision loss as the identification of an incoming call gets announced with the use of the software. The [[United States Access Board]] - the agency who is responsible for Section 508 - deployed accessaphone along with a Cisco phone system for their employees who required certain access to specific phone features like Audible Caller ID or those employees with physical impairments who needed voice access to the phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/web/about/responsibility/accessibility/CiscoAccessibilityBrochure.pdf|title=Cisco: Innovation in Accessibility}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Foundation for the Blind Case Study===
In 2009, The [[American Foundation for the Blind]] did a case study and determined that accessaphone was compliant with [[Section 508]] and did in fact enhance [[Voice over IP]] telephony equipment for users needing certain access to that equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afb.org/afbconsulting.asp?SectionID=89&amp;DocumentID=4843#summary|title=American Foundation for the Blind Case Study}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7256">The [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES), the symmetric block cipher ratified as a standard by [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] of the United States (NIST), was chosen using a process lasting from 1997 to 2000 that was markedly more open and transparent than its predecessor, the [[Data Encryption Standard]] (DES). This process won praise from the open cryptographic community, and helped to increase confidence in the security of the winning algorithm from those who were suspicious of backdoors in the predecessor, DES.

A new standard was needed primarily because DES has a relatively small 56-bit key which was becoming vulnerable to [[brute-force attack]]s. In addition, the DES was designed primarily for hardware and is relatively slow when implemented in software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=cryptology:: The Data Encryption Standard and the Advanced Encryption Standard |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/145058/cryptology/233467/The-Data-Encryption-Standard-and-the-Advanced-Encryption-Standard |website=Britannica.com |accessdate=2018-10-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514013110/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/145058/cryptology/233467/The-Data-Encryption-Standard-and-the-Advanced-Encryption-Standard |archive-date=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Triple-DES avoids the problem of a small key size, it is very slow even in hardware, it is unsuitable for limited-resource platforms, and it may be affected by potential security issues connected with the (today comparatively small) block size of 64 bits.

==Start of the process==
On January 2, 1997, NIST announced that they wished to choose a successor to DES to be known as AES. Like DES, this was to be "an unclassified, publicly disclosed encryption algorithm capable of protecting sensitive government information well into the next century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://csrc.nist.gov/news/1997/announcing-development-of-fips-for-advanced-encryp |title=Announcing Development of a Federal Information Processing Standard for Advanced Encryption Standard |date=1992-01-02 |website=csrc.nist.gov |access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, rather than simply publishing a successor, NIST asked for input from interested parties on how the successor should be chosen. Interest from the open cryptographic community was immediately intense, and NIST received a great many submissions during the three-month comment period.

The result of this feedback was a call for new algorithms on September 12, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Requesting Candidate Algorithm Nominations for AES |url=https://csrc.nist.gov/news/1997/requesting-candidate-algorithm-nominations-for-aes |website=csrc.nist.gov |accessdate=2018-10-09 |date=1997-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithms were all to be block ciphers, supporting a block size of 128 bits and key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits. Such ciphers were rare at the time of the announcement; the best known was probably [[Square (cipher)|Square]].

==Rounds one and two==
In the nine months that followed, fifteen different designs were created and submitted from several different countries. They were, in alphabetical order: CAST-256, CRYPTON, DEAL, DFC, E2, FROG, HPC, LOKI97, MAGENTA, MARS, RC6, Rijndael, SAFER+, Serpent, and Twofish.

In the ensuing debate, many advantages and disadvantages of the different candidates were investigated by cryptographers; they were assessed not only on security, but also on performance in a variety of settings (PCs of various architectures, smart cards, hardware implementations) and on their feasibility in limited environments (smart cards with very limited memory, low gate count implementations, FPGAs).

Some designs fell due to [[cryptanalysis]] that ranged from minor flaws to significant attacks, while others lost favour due to poor performance in various environments or through having little to offer over other candidates. NIST held two conferences to discuss the submissions (AES1, August 1998 and AES2, March 1999), and in August 1999 they announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AES Development - Cryptographic Standards and Guidelines |url=https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-standards-and-guidelines/archived-crypto-projects/aes-development |website=csrc.nist.gov |accessdate=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; that they were narrowing the field from fifteen to five: [[MARS (cryptography)|MARS]], [[RC6]], [[Rijndael]], [[Serpent (cipher)|Serpent]], and [[Twofish]]. All five algorithms, commonly referred to as "AES finalists", were designed by cryptographers considered well-known and respected in the community.
The AES2 conference votes were as follows:
*[[Rijndael]]: 86 positive, 10 negative
*[[Serpent (cipher)|Serpent]]: 59 positive, 7 negative
*[[Twofish]]: 31 positive, 21 negative
*[[RC6]]: 23 positive, 37 negative
*[[MARS (cryptography)|MARS]]: 13 positive, 84 negative

A further round of intense analysis and cryptanalysis followed, culminating in the AES3 conference in April 2000, at which a representative of each of the final five teams made a presentation arguing why their design should be chosen as the AES.

==Selection of the winner==
On October 2, 2000, NIST announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Swenson |first1=Gayle |title=Commerce Department Announces Winner of Global Information Security Competition |url=https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2000/10/commerce-department-announces-winner-global-information-security |website=NIST |accessdate=2018-10-09 |date=2000-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Rijndael]] had been selected as the proposed AES and started the process of making it the official standard by publishing an announcement in the [[Federal Register]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=NIST |title=Announcing Draft Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Request for Comments |journal=Federal Register |date=2001-02-28 |volume=66 |page=12762 |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2001-02-28/pdf/01-4886.pdf |accessdate=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; on February 28, 2001 for the draft FIPS to solicit comments. On November 26, 2001, NIST announced that [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] was approved as [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS PUB]] 197.

NIST won praises from the cryptographic community for the openness and care with which they ran the standards process. [[Bruce Schneier]], one of the authors of the losing Twofish algorithm, wrote after the competition was over that "I have nothing but good things to say about NIST and the AES process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Crypto-Gram: October 15, 2000 - Schneier on Security |url=http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0010.html#8 |website=www.schneier.com |accessdate=2018-10-09 |date=2000-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nottingham MMB 10 Victoria Centre.jpg|thumb|The Aqua Horological Tintinnabulator]]
The '''Aqua Horological Tintinnabulator''' (also known as the '''Victoria Centre Clock''' or the '''Emett Clock'''&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; or '''The Time Fountain''' is a 'water-powered' [[clock]]. From 1973 to 2010 it was installed on the ground floor at the [[Victoria Centre]] in [[Nottingham]], England. In 2015 it was reinstalled in the shopping centre on the first floor.&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-33166064&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was commissioned by [[Capital &amp; Counties Properties|Capital and Counties]] in 1970 and designed and built by kinetic sculptor [[Rowland Emett]].  A photograph shows a pencilled note on a whitewashed beam in Emett's barn:''26th August 1970 (1/2 Closing Day) construction of the fountain started''.&lt;ref name=cc&gt;Capital and Counties Property Co. Ltd, "Victoria Centre Bulletin No.7 January 1971", BBDO Public Relations, 8 Baker Street, London, W1M 2BR&lt;/ref&gt;  Installation commenced late 1972 (the year the Victoria Centre opened) and was completed before 20 February 1973.  The foundation stone reads ''THE VICTORIA CENTRE TIME FOUNTAIN FEBRUARY 20TH 1973 BY EMETT.''&lt;ref&gt;On public view at the foot of the Time Fountain.&lt;/ref&gt; In its original design, this clock played [[Jean-Philippe Rameau|Rameau's]] Gigue en Rondeau II from the E-minor suite of his ''[[Pièces de Clavecin]]'' when striking the hour and half hour. The clock parts were designed by [[Thwaites &amp; Reed]].{{r|cc}}

It is 23ft high&lt;ref&gt;The Estates Gazette, Volume 225, Part 2&lt;/ref&gt; and has become an icon of Nottingham.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/nottingham/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8459000/8459490.stm |title=Victoria Centre clock removal is "pure rumour" |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-01-15 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between its installation in 1973 and 2010, around £250,000 in coins had been thrown into the fountain.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

===Refurbishment===
In November 2011, local engineer Pete Dexter contacted the Centre management to ask why the clock appeared to be defunct. He was allowed to investigate, leading to his design and build of a new electrical control system for the animation. He also re-instated the original music, replacing an audio cassette tape system with one based on an audio CD.
In February 2014, the clock was dismantled by Pete Dexter and technicians from intu Victoria Centre and taken to Croxall and other locations near Tamworth where Pete Dexter and the Rowland Emett Society carried out some initial refurbishment of the parts. In particular the frame was restored to its original configuration by adding many sections of tube, some of which were to raise the height by around 400mm.  This height had been lost through two occasions where the legs buried in concrete had been sliced off to move the clock. The frame colour was restored to aircraft grey-green based on a paint chip discovered during dismantling. Pete Dexter designed and built a mechanical drive for the cobweb wheel, based on original photographs. The clock was assembled as a dry installation in Millennium Point, Birmingham. This formed part of a wider exhibition in Birmingham of the works of Rowland Emett.&lt;ref&gt;Dexter, Pete, MSc CEng "''Time Fountain Technical Reference Manual''", 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
After around three months, it was dismantled and put back into storage until December 2014, when the parts were transported back to Nottingham. Between January and June 2015, Pete Dexter and staff at the Victoria Centre carried out significant further renovation.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.experiencenottinghamshire.com/the-emett-clock-returns-to-the-intu-victoria-centre/&lt;/ref&gt;
The clock was reassembled on the upper mall north end of the Victoria Centre and officially restarted on 17 June 2015. It sits in a purpose-built basin equipped with a newly designed water system, reinstating a fountain of twelve water jets, as had existed originally.{{r|bbc2}}

==Description==
It is topped by four silver-white clock faces with golden hands and numerals. The animated sculpture underneath consists of a sunflower with 36 copper petals, partially obscuring an orchestra of six jewelled players; three squirrels and three birds. At fifteen-minute intervals, a bell strikes followed by a performance; the petals are lowered to reveal the players, the entire orchestra rotates and each player spins on its vertical axis. The music for harpsichord ''Gigue en Rondeau II'' plays for around 75 seconds after which the petals are raised and the animation ceases. A two-metre diameter cobweb wheel carrying jewelled butterflies and frogs rotates continuously during the daytime as does the 'Top Feature' which consists of three arms with jewelled pendants: one is a flying fish ridden by a squirrel, the second is a squirrel pushing a pram with a bird's nest and birds above, the third is a peacock rowing a boat with a squirrel on the rudder.  In the middle of the sculpture is a floral bouquet sitting on a large copper leaf, adorned by jewelled birds. The clock originally struck and performed on the hour and half hour&lt;ref&gt;The Times 28 February 1973&lt;/ref&gt; but was modified at some point to perform every fifteen minutes.
Motive power is provided by four 230 Volt AC Parvalux geared motors (cobweb wheel, Top Feature, petals and orchestra) and two 230 Volt AC Crouzet synchronous motors (going and strike trains). The bell solenoid is powered by 240VDC pulses. Electrical control of the motors is via 12 Volt DC relays.

'''Beaker''' is a [[Muppet]] character from ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. He is the shy, long-suffering assistant of Dr. [[Bunsen Honeydew]], and is likewise named after a piece of [[Beaker (glassware)|laboratory equipment]].

During the first season of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', Dr. Honeydew presented the Muppet Labs segments by himself; Beaker was added as his lab assistant from the second season on. Beaker has [[bulging eyes]], a shock of red hair, and a [[drawbridge]] mouth which serves as a frown. He was originally puppeteered and voiced by [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]] until Hunt's death in 1992, when the role was taken over primarily by [[Steve Whitmire]]. After Whitmire was fired in 2016, [[David Rudman]] took over the character.

Beaker is a magnet for disaster; he routinely experiences mishaps such as being blown up, electrocuted, eaten by large monsters, or afflicted with awkward side effects caused by Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's experiments. Beaker communicates in a nervous, high-pitched squeak that sounds like "Mee-mee-mee mee". In books and merchandise, the sound is spelled "Meep". In ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' he appeared to say something other than "mee" or "meep" (he "meeps" Honeydew's previous line "sadly temporary"). Although he can say normal words at times, such as " Bye-bye." His tone or expression helps to communicate his meaning. 

==Appearances==
Beaker rapidly became a favorite with audiences, who both sympathized with and enjoyed laughing at his humorous sufferings. Occasionally, Beaker was able to take revenge, particularly in a segment when he inadvertently made numerous copies of himself and spent the rest of the episode chasing Dr. Honeydew around the theater.  In the 2008 [[TV special]], ''[[A Muppets Christmas: Letters to Santa]]'', Beaker is even more fortunate when he tests a wish machine and gets the company of model [[Petra Němcová]], and not only refuses Honeydew's order to send her back, but then also successfully teleports away with her to apparently enjoy his first wish for the rest of the story...

Beaker has also appeared as a musical performer, singing "[[Danny Boy]]," "[[Carol of the Bells]]," and "[[Habanera (aria)|Habanera]]" with the [[Swedish Chef]] and [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]], and "[[Feelings (Morris Albert song)|Feelings]]" and "[[Dust in the wind]]" solo. He also sang "[[Ode to Joy]]" with his clones who were accidentally formed by Dr. Honeydew's copying machine. The "Danny Boy" performance was marked by the Chef's singing in his trademark gibberish and Animal's inability to remember anything but the first three words. For "Feelings," Animal had to shush the increasingly unruly crowd (who tormented the Muppets throughout the episode) so Beaker could finish: "QUIET!!...Thank you."  In the 2011 film ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]'', Beaker sang a comedic [[a cappella]] version of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana's]] "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" as part of a [[barbershop quartet]] with [[Sam Eagle|Sam the Eagle]], [[Rowlf the Dog]] and [[Link Hogthrob]]. Because of Disney's designation of [[the Muppets]] franchise as being for family audiences, Beaker was given a crucial role replacing the song's more questionable lines like "a [[mulatto]]" and "my [[libido]]" with "mee-mee-mee-mo."&lt;ref name="Fresh Air Muppets"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gross|first=Terri|title=The Muppet Fans Who Made 'The Muppets' Movie|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/11/23/142360224/the-muppet-fans-who-made-the-muppets-movie|work=Fresh Air|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=December 7, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206121503/http://www.npr.org/2011/11/23/142360224/the-muppet-fans-who-made-the-muppets-movie|archivedate=December 6, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two scientists were later incorporated into the ''[[Muppet Babies]]'' [[animated series]]. [[Howie Mandel]] (during early seasons) and [[Dave Coulier]] voiced Bunsen, and [[Frank Welker]] provided Beaker's squeaky meeps. Beaker was performed by [[Kevin Clash]] in ''The Muppet Show Live''. An animated Beaker was also voiced by Richard Hunt, his usual performer during that period, when he appeared in the short lived ''[[Little Muppet Monsters]]'' series.

==In popular culture==
Beaker's "meep" sound has become a well-known [[catchphrase]], and is referenced in various media.

In a 2004 Internet poll sponsored by the [[BBC]] and the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], Beaker and Dr. Bunsen Honeydew were voted Britain's favourite cinematic scientists. They beat [[Mr. Spock]], their closest rival, by a margin of two to one, winning a third of the total votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Not Such Muppets Now|url=http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/web/News/BritishScienceAssociationNews/_TopScreenScientist.htm|website=British Science Association|publisher=British Science Association|accessdate=December 3, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226204556/http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/web/News/BritishScienceAssociationNews/_TopScreenScientist.htm|archivedate=December 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beaker features in an episode of [[WWE Raw]], assisting [[Santino Marella]] ringside in his match with [[Jack Swagger]] by providing him with a special energy drink formulated by Dr. Honeydew. In the same episode, Beaker is revealed to be distantly related to WWE wrestler [[Sheamus]].&lt;ref name=WWERaw&gt;{{cite web|last1=Limer|first1=Eric|title=Beaker Gets Involved in a WWE Raw Match [Video]|url=http://www.themarysue.com/beaker-wwe-raw-match/|website=The Mary Sue|date=November 1, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072307/http://www.themarysue.com/beaker-wwe-raw-match/|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buoyancy aid.jpg|thumb|A person wearing a buoyancy aid with a reflective strip]]
'''Buoyancy aids''' are a specialist form of ''[[personal flotation device]]'' (PFD) used most commonly by [[kayak]]ers, [[canoe]]ists and [[dinghy sailing|dinghy sailors]]. They are designed as a flotation aid, rather than a life-saving device and have several key differences to other PFD's and [[lifejacket]]s. Regardless of the specification of buoyancy aids, they do not provide (nor are they intended to) the same high level of protection as lifejackets. Therefore, they should not be used as a substitute for a life-jacket, particularly where children are concerned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2194056/Scottish-Highlands-canoe-tragedy-Three-canoe-tragedy-children-wearing-life-jackets.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Canoeing and kayaking buoyancy aids are designed with mobility in mind. A buoyancy aid that does not fit properly can restrict a paddler's (kayaker's) range of movement, which could cause them to tire or prevent them from paddling properly. They typically have front and back foam buoyancy, with none or very little around the sides to allow for better arm movements.

== Types of Buoyancy Aid ==

All canoeing/kayaking buoyanith a [[Personal flotation device#Foam core|foam core]], instead of being inflatable like some life jackets. This removes the possibility of them bursting or not being activated in the case of an incapacitated paddler. The foam used is typically closed cell PVC (polyvinyl chloride), although some manufacturers are now starting to use less [[toxic]] and more [[recyclable]] materials. Older designs used vertically aligned ribs of foam all around the body, but more modern designs typically feature front and rear slabs of foam buoyancy, with the sides left clear to allow unrestricted rotation and arm movement. Most buoyancy aids are one of three basic designs:

*'''Over the head vest''', where the one-piece vest is pulled on over the head.
*'''Front zip jacket''', where the buoyancy aid is worn like a regular [[jacket]], zipped up at the front. This design limits the front-buoyancy as it requires two separate blocks of foam and a gap for the [[zipper|zip]].
*'''Side zip''' is a combination of the other two, with a zip on the side rather than along the front. The added gap in one side makes it easier to get the vest on, and means that the front buoyancy can be one whole piece.

All buoyancy aids include some form of strap for tightening the buoyancy aid, preventing it from coming off in the water. Many white water designs feature multiple straps on the shoulders and waist to ensure the buoyancy aid can not be swept off in fast water. They may also include pockets for storing equipment and a range of safety and rescue features. Some lower quality ones only offer a belt, and these are often poor fitting and may be designed for generic water sports rather than specifically canoeing/kayaking.

There is a large variety of designs to fit every figure and purpose. It is important to have a buoyancy aid that fits comfortably, allowing freedom of movement. It is also important that it is suitable for the chosen discipline and the [[Grade (slope)|grade]] of water being paddled. Each discipline has different requirements and although one buoyancy aid can be used for multiple disciplines, there are several factors to consider which type to choose.

=== Canoe polo and slalom ===
These are designed with high maneuverability as a key feature, often at the expense of buoyancy. Minimalistic designs which tend to hug the body tightly and are well cut around the arms aim to allow the wearer complete freedom of motion (something important to both [[Canoe slalom|Slalom]] and [[Canoe polo|Polo]] paddlers as well as [[playboat]]ers). These vests may not be fully suitable for other purposes, such as whitewater paddling where additional buoyancy is required due to the higher flow of water. Canoe polo rules specify that the buoyancy aids must  have protective buoyancy at the sides of the garment,  resulting in a garment that has more overall coverage

=== Sea and touring ===
Buoyancy aids for sea and long distance touring often feature several large pockets for storing essential equipment, and many also accommodate [[hydration pack]]s. They have to be comfortable to wear whilst paddling for long distances, and so typically have very low cut sides to allow the arms free movement. More recently they are being designed more and more like whitewater vests, with low cut fronts to allow the paddler to lean forward easily.

=== Whitewater ===
[[Whitewater]] buoyancy aids are designed to provide enough buoyancy in fast whitewater rivers, should the paddler [[capsize]] and leave the kayak. They are often more bulky than Slalom/Polo vests, but are usually cut short at the front to allow the paddler to lean further forward despite the thicker foam and allow good [[torso|trunk]] rotation for quick turns. They always have shoulder and side straps to ensure they are not swept off in fast [[rapids]].

They typically feature one or two pockets to store basic essentials such as a [[Knife|rescue knife]], [[carabiner]] and tow-line. Many often also feature [[#Harnesses|harnesses]] for use in rescues, however these are often used without proper training and can become more of a danger to both the rescuer and the swimmer if used incorrectly.

As an example, WW harnesses require a significant load to release effectively, (usually provided by the force of the water, when a rescuer in the river is held by rope from the bank). Without this load the harness may not release. So it is not a good idea to use these for low load situations, (e.g. towing kayaks), and in an incident  you really need to get the rescuer to release from the harness, and not allow the person on the bank to release their end as the rescuer would end up swimming down river with 30+ metres of slack rope on their back. Training is vital

== Specifications ==
Buoyancy aids come with a set of specifications detailing their sizing, weight range, and the standards they adhere to. This is often in a table printed onto the inside of the buoyancy aid, or a label on the bag/box. Most companies give the specifications for each of their models on all of their buoyancy aids, to simplify the manufacturing process, so it is important to check the model and size range of your particular buoyancy aid.

Buoyancy aids should detail:
* '''Chest size''': Usually a range either in inches or centimetres.
* '''Weight range''': Either in kilograms or pounds.
* '''Force provided''': The buoyant force provided by the buoyancy aid.
For a buoyancy aid to be sold in the European Union, it must be '''C.E.''' tested and approved.

*In the USA, a buoyancy aid may be approved by the ''United States Coast Guard'' (although this is not a requirement). Most canoeing and kayaking buoyancy aids class as ''"Type III Flotation Aids"'', which means they provide a minimum of 15.5&amp;nbsp;lbf ([[pounds-force]]) (69 N) of buoyancy.

=== The 50N Buoyancy aid ===
Buoyancy aids with providing only 50 [[Newtons|N]] of force should only be used by swimmers in sheltered waters when help is close at hand. They are not guaranteed to turn a person from a face-down position in the water.

== Ageing ==
The foam used in buoyancy aids does degrade with age. Manufacturers add additional foam to ensure that their buoyancy aids will still provide enough force even after years of use. A rough life expectancy is three years of use, although buoyancy aids exposed to polluted water may degrade faster than normally expected.
In practice Buoyancy aids far exceed a 3-year service life expectancy. they can be tested for buoyancy using a weight (for adult sizes this is about 5.5&amp;nbsp;kg)The test is simple, attach weight, squeeze out air, drop in water and force it under until bubbles stop rising, then let it go. and if the BA/PFD surfaces it's OK, many websites publish guidance on this as the actual weight required is different in some situations. (In the UK the Scouts produce useful guidance).
The other issues are damage, stitching and wear. BA/PFDs need regular and routine inspection of any belts, stitching and other parts. this wear and damage will serve as valuable indicators on when to retire your PFD/BA

&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/facts/pdfs/fs120603.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Harnesses ==
Many [[white water]] buoyancy aids, as well as some sea kayak ones, feature a safety harness. These fit around the buoyancy aid below the arms and can be used for Live Bait Rescues (where a rescuer swims out into the river on a line to rescue a swimmer) or for anchoring a [[belayer]] onto the bank. They feature quick-release buckles to quickly remove the harness, and these are often (but not always) designed to release automatically past a certain load/pressure. Often harnesses have a metal ring at the back for attaching a rope with a [[carabiner#Locking carabiners|screwgate carabiner]]. Use of a non-locking carabiner can allow the carabiner to accidentally clip onto other straps on the buoyancy aid during use, thus preventing the harness from being released, and as such they should not be used for attaching to a harness.

Many harnesses feature a metal friction plate which stops the belt from slipping under high-load situations, however these can also prevent the harness coming off when swimming and as such present more of a hazard than an aid. It is often recommended that the belt be removed from within the friction plate and only threaded back through if the situation requires an anchored [[belay]].

Improvised harnesses (ropes around the waist, belts, or attaching ropes directly onto the buoyancy aid itself) can present a serious danger to the wearer, as they can not be released or may not be strong enough to withstand the load required.

== Pet buoyancy aid ==
In recent years pet buoyancy aids have become quite popular. A web search or visit to a pet supply store will reveal many types and brands of pet buoyancy aids including full life jackets, vests, and flotation collars. The purpose, design, and composition of these buoyancy aids are very similar to the human version with the major difference being that pet buoyancy aids are not usually required by law, also they are generally not certified by the Coast Guard or any other government department.

== History ==
{{Main|Personal flotation device#History}}
Ancient instances of the life jacket can be traced back to simple blocks of wood or cork used by Norwegian seamen. The modern life jacket is generally credited to one Captain Ward, a Royal National Lifeboat Institution inspector in the United Kingdom, who, in 1854, created a cork vest to be worn by lifeboat crews for both weather protection and buoyancy.

'''Burnt-in timecode''' (often abbreviated to '''BITC''' by analogy to [[Timecode/Vertical interval timecode|VITC]]) is a [[human-readable]] on-screen version of the [[timecode]] information for a piece of material superimposed on a video image. BITC is sometimes used in conjunction with "real" machine-readable timecode, but more often used in copies of original material on to a non-broadcast format such as VHS, so that the VHS copies can be traced back to their master tape and the original time codes easily located. 

Many professional [[VTR]]s can "burn" (overlay) the tape timecode onto one of their outputs. This output (which usually also displays the setup menu or [[on-screen display]]) is known as the ''super out'' or ''monitor out''. The ''character'' switch or menu item turns this behaviour on or off. The ''character'' function is also used to display the timecode on the preview monitors in [[linear video editing|linear editing]] suites.

Videotapes that are recorded with timecode numbers overlaid on the video are referred to as ''window dubs'', named after the "window" that displays the burnt-in timecode on-screen.

When editing was done using magnetic tapes that were subject to damage from excessive wear, it was common to use a window dub as a working copy for the majority of the editing process.  Editing decisions would be made using a window dub, and no specialized equipment was needed to write down an [[edit decision list]] which would then be replicated from the high-quality masters.

Timecode can also be superimposed on video using a dedicated overlay device, often called a "window dub inserter".  This inputs a video signal and its separate timecode audio signal, reads the timecode, superimposes the timecode display over the video, and outputs the combined display (usually via composite), all in real time.  Stand-alone timecode generator / readers often have the window dub function built-in.  

Some consumer cameras, in particular DV cameras, can "burn" (overlay) the tape timecode onto the composite output. This output typically is semi-transparent and may include other tape information. It is usually activated by turning on the 'display' info in one of the camera's sub-menus. While not as 'professional' as an overlay as created by a professional [[VCR]]s, it is a cheap alternative that is just as accurate.

Timecode is stored in the metadata areas of captured DV AVI files, and some software is able to "burn" (overlay) this into the video frames. For example, DVMP Pro&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvmp.co.uk/dv-media-player-pro.htm DVMP Pro] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629090029/http://www.dvmp.co.uk/dv-media-player-pro.htm |date=June 29, 2007 }} - Software for burning in timecode and other items of metadata for DV AVI files.&lt;/ref&gt; is able to "burn" timecode or other items of DV metadata (such as date and time, iris, shutter speed, gain, white balance mode, etc.) into DV AVI files.

[[Optical character recognition|OCR]] techniques can be used to read BITC in situations where other forms of timecode are not available.

[[File:Italian - "Cassone" - Walters 6535.jpg|thumb|Walnut ''cassone'' in the form of an Antique [[sarcophagus]], Rome, 16th century ([[Walters Art Museum]])]]

A '''cassone''' (plural ''cassoni'') or '''marriage chest''' is a rich and showy Italian type of [[Chest (furniture)|chest]], which may be inlaid or carved, prepared with [[gesso]] ground then painted and gilded. ''[[Pastiglia]]'' was decoration in low [[relief]] carved or moulded in gesso, and was very widely used. The cassone ("large chest") was one of the trophy furnishings of rich merchants and aristocrats in Italian culture, from the [[Late Middle Ages]] onward. The cassone was the most important piece of furniture of that time. It was given to a bride and placed in the bridal suite. It would be given to the bride during the wedding, and it was the bride's parents' contribution to the wedding.

There are in fact a variety of different terms used in contemporary records for chests, and the attempts by modern scholars to distinguish between them remain speculative, and all decorated chests are today usually called ''cassoni'', which was probably not the case at the time.  For example, a ''forziere'' probably denoted a decorated chest with a lock.&lt;ref&gt;Ajmar-Wollheim, Marta; Dennis, Flora, ''At home in Renaissance Italy'', 2006, Victoria and Albert Museum, {{ISBN|1-85177-488-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-85177-488-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Since a cassone contained the personal goods of the bride, it was a natural vehicle for painted decoration commemorating the marriage in [[heraldry]] and, when figural painted panels began to be included in the decor from the early ''[[quattrocento]]'', flattering allegory. The side panels offered a flat surface for a suitable painting, with subjects drawn from [[Romance (heroic literature)|courtly romance]] or, much less often, religious subjects.  By the 15th century subjects from classical mythology or history became the most popular. Great Florentine artists of the 15th century were called upon to decorate ''cassoni'', though as [[Vasari]] complains, by his time in the 16th century, artists thought such work beneath them.  Some Tuscan artists in [[Siena]] and Florence specialized in such cassone panels, which were preserved as autonomous works of art by 19th century collectors and dealers, who sometimes discarded the cassone itself. From the late 1850s, neo-Renaissance cassoni were confected for dealers like William Blundell Spence, Stefano Bardini or Elia Volpi in order to present surviving cassone panels to clients in a more "authentic" and glamorous presentation.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Callmann, "William Blundell Spence and the Transformation of Renaissance Cassoni". ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''141''' (June 1999:338–348).&lt;/ref&gt; 

A typical place for such a cassone was in a chamber at the foot of a bed that was enclosed in curtains. Such a situation is a familiar setting for depictions of the [[Annunciation]] or the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] of St. Anne to the Virgin Mary. A cassone was largely immovable. In a culture where chairs were reserved for important personages, often pillows scattered upon the floor of a chamber provided informal seating, and a cassone could provide both a backrest and a table surface. The symbolic "humility" that modern scholars read into Annunciations where the Virgin sits reading upon the floor, perhaps underestimates this familiar mode of seating.

At the end of the 15th century, a new classicising style arose, and early [[Renaissance]] cassoni of central and northern Italy were carved and partly gilded, and given classical décor, with panels flanked by fluted corner pilasters, under friezes and cornices, or with sculptural panels in high or low relief. Some early to mid-sixteenth-century cassoni drew their inspiration from Roman [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] (''illustration, right''). By the mid-sixteenth century [[Giorgio Vasari]] could remark on the old-fashioned cassoni with painted scenes, examples of which could be seen in the palazzi of Florentine families.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, ''Le vite de' piu eccellenti pittori''..., ed. G. Milanesi, vol. II p 148,  noted in Ellen Callmann 1999:339 and note 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

A cassone that has been provided with a high panelled back and sometimes a footrest, for both hieratic and practical reasons, becomes a ''cassapanca'' ("chest-bench"). ''Cassapanche'' were immovably fixed in the main public room of a [[palazzo]], the ''sala'' or ''salone.'' They were part of the ''immobili'' ("unmoveables"), perhaps even more than the removable glazed window casements, and might be left in place, even if the palazzo passed to another family.

'''Clinatec''' is a [[biomedical]] research center based at the [[Polygone Scientifique]] in [[Grenoble]]. Doctors, biologists and [[Portal:Nanotechnology|micro- and nanotechnology]] experts work side-by-side at the 6,000 m² facility. Around a hundred researchers and employees work at the center. When it opened at the end of 2011, it was hailed as the first center of its kind in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-leti.cea.fr/fr/Decouvrez-le-Leti/Les-plateformes-d-innovation/Plateforme-Clinatec Website of Leti] ([[CEA-Leti: Laboratoire d'électronique des technologies de l'information|CEA-Leti]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isere-magazine.fr/sante/Pages/2012/Clinatec.aspx Isère magazine décembre 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; With six hospital rooms, cutting-edge medical imaging equipment and an operating suite, Clinatec was developed by the Research Division of the [[French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission|CEA (French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission)]], [[Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Grenoble|Grenoble-Alpes University Hospital (CHU)]], [[Inserm]] and the [[Université Grenoble Alpes]]. The primary focus is on [[cancer]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clinatec.fr/en/challenges_/fight-cancer/ Fight cancer]&lt;/ref&gt; [[neurodegenerative diseases]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clinatec.fr/en/challenges_/a-cure-for-parkinson/ A cure for Parkinson's disease]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[disability]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clinatec.fr/en/challenges_/get-quadraplegics-walking/ Get quadraplegics walking]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Professor [[Alim Louis Benabid]] and Jean Therme first met back in 2006.

Alim Louis Benabid is a neurosurgeon. Together with Professor Pierre Pollak, he developed a new treatment for [[Parkinson's disease]], [[deep brain stimulation]]. His work received recognition in 2014 with the [[Lasker Award]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/show/deep-brain-stimulation-for-parkinsons-disease/ Lasker Award]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016 with the [[European Inventor Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epo.org/news-issues/press/releases/archive/2016/20160609d.html European Inventor Award 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean Therme is Director of Technological Research at CEA Grenoble.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/connaissance/membres%20consscientif/Therme%20Jean.pdf Jean Therme]&lt;/ref&gt; He has worked tirelessly to make Grenoble a key center of expertise in electronics and [[Portal:Nanotechnology|micro- and nanotechnology]], and to encourage close collaboration between the worlds of research and industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesechos.fr/11/06/2013/LesEchos/21454-051-ECH_faire-marcher-un-paralyse---le-defi-du-cea.htm The challenge taken up by the French CEA: get quadriplegics walking]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both men were convinced that millions of lives could be transformed by merging medical research and technology R&amp;D. They agreed that the way to achieve this would be to bring together doctors, researchers, biologists, engineers, robotics engineers, mathematicians and knowledge engineers to work at a single site.

In 2010–11, the 6,000 m² building was built and equipped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giant-grenoble.org/en/biotechnology-for-healthcare-platforms/ Biotechnology for Healthcare Platforms]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the first patient was admitted to the center,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lopinion.fr/10-juin-2014/a-clinatec-technomedecine-a-l-assaut-d-alzheimer-13174 First patient]&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to the "Protool" clinical trial coordinated by Professor Berger. For the first time, it was possible to use non-invasive procedures to explore regions of the brain that had hitherto been inaccessible. The exciting prospects opened up by this technology, the result of the coupling of technology developed at [[CEA-Leti: Laboratoire d'électronique des technologies de l'information|CEA-Leti]] with the clinical approach taken by researchers at [[Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Grenoble|Grenoble-Alpes University Hospital (CHU)]], [[Inserm]] and the [[Université Grenoble Alpes]], led to setting up the MedPrint start-up, which won an I-lab award in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clinatec.fr/une-stratup-de-clinatec-remporte-le-grand-prix-lab I-Lab Reward]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Clinatec launched a campaign to raise 30 million euros in order to develop a number of projects,&lt;ref&gt;[http://acteursdeleconomie.latribune.fr/strategie/marketing-communication/2016-06-03/clinatec-30-millions-d-euros-pour-un-centre-de-recherche-du-futur.html Clinatec 30 million euros for a research center of futur]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lepoint.fr/editos-du-point/anne-jeanblanc/clinatec-les-malades-n-ont-pas-le-temps-d-etre-patients-07-03-2016-2023476_57.php Patients can't afford to be patient]&lt;/ref&gt; including: 
*the Brain Computer Interface (BCI) project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clinatec.fr/recherche/nos-projets/le-projet-bci/ BCI Project]&lt;/ref&gt; aiming to prove that a quadriplegic patient can drive neuroprosthetic effectors with multiple degrees of freedom, such as an exoskeleton, based on decoding cortical signals (ElectroCorticoGrams) measured by a Wimagine implant, and can do this through training to make the most of their cerebral plasticity,
*and the Near InfraRed (NIR) project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clinatec.fr/recherche/nos-projets/le-projet-nir/ NIR Project]&lt;/ref&gt; aiming to demonstrate that near-infrared light can have neuro-protective effects in treating Parkinson's disease.

== Founding Members ==
[[File:Clinatec.JPG|Clinatec|thumb|200px]]

Clinatec is the outcome of a solid partnership between the [[French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission|CEA (French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission)]], [[Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Grenoble|Grenoble-Alpes University Hospital (CHU)]], [[Inserm]] and the [[Université Grenoble Alpes]].

== The clinatec endowment fund ==
The Clinatec [[endowment fund]] was set up in 2014. A sponsorship campaign has been launched, aiming to raise 30 million euros by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acteursdeleconomie.latribune.fr/strategie/marketing-communication/2016-06-03/clinatec-30-millions-d-euros-pour-un-centre-de-recherche-du-futur.html Clinatec 30 million euros for a research center of futur]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lepoint.fr/editos-du-point/anne-jeanblanc/clinatec-les-malades-n-ont-pas-le-temps-d-etre-patients-07-03-2016-2023476_57.php Patients can't afford to be patient]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==

=== Lasker Award ===
Professor [[Alim Louis Benabid]], Clinatec's founder and Chairman of the Board, member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]], is one of the joint winners of the prestigious [[Lasker Award|Albert-Lasker Award]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/show/deep-brain-stimulation-for-parkinsons-disease/ Lasker Award 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; for clinical research awarded by the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laskerfoundation.org/ Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lasker Award]] has gained a reputation for identifying future winners of the Nobel Prize. Eighty-six Lasker laureates have received the Nobel Prize, including 32 in the last two decades&lt;/ref&gt; Professors Alim-Louis Benabid and Mahlon R. Delong of Emory University received awards for their contributions to the development of [[deep brain stimulation]]. The technique consists in stimulating the subthalamic nucleus to inhibit tremors and restore motor function in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease and from complications caused by [[L-DOPA|Levodopa]], a drug widely used in treating the disease.

=== Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences ===
Set up in 2013 by [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and Priscilla Chan of [[Facebook]], [[Sergey Brin]], founder of [[Google]], and [[Yuri Milner]] and [[Anne Wojcicki]], the founders of [[23andMe]], the [[Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences]] is awarded to researchers whose work extends human life expectancy.&lt;ref&gt;https://breakthroughprize.org/Laureates/2/P1/Y2015 Breakthrough Prize 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
Professor [[Alim Louis Benabid]] was awarded the prize in 2015 for the development of [[deep brain stimulation]], a technique which has revolutionized the treatment of [[Parkinson’s disease]].

=== European Inventor Award 2016 ===
On June 9, 2016, Professor [[Alim Louis Benabid]] received the [[European Inventor Award]] 2016&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epo.org/news-issues/press/releases/archive/2016/20160609d.html European Inventor Award 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; for his work on [[deep brain stimulation]]. The technique, now used all over the world, has radically transformed the lives of more than 150,000 people suffering from Parkinson's disease, and significantly improved their quality of life.

== Media interest ==
In July 2012, Philippe Pozzo di Borgo, rendered quadriplegic following an accident and the man whose story was the inspiration for the French film [[The Intouchables|Intouchables]], visited Clinatec with a group of local journalists. He expressed his confidence in and admiration for this research program in a report aired on regional news channel, [[France 3 Alpes]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/alpes/info/le-heros-d-intouchables-a-clinatec-74779742.html Hero's Intouchables visiting Clinatec]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''computer''' is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of [[arithmetic]] or [[Boolean algebra|logical]] operations automatically via [[computer programming]]. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called ''[[Computer program|programs]].'' These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.

Computers are used as [[control system]]s for a wide variety of [[Programmable logic controller|industrial]] and [[Consumer electronics|consumer devices]]. This includes simple special purpose devices like [[microwave oven]]s and [[remote control]]s, factory devices such as [[industrial robot]]s and [[computer-aided design]], and also general purpose devices like [[personal computer]]s and [[mobile device]]s such as [[smartphone]]s.

Early computers were only conceived as calculating devices. Since ancient times, simple manual devices like the [[abacus]] aided people in doing calculations. Early in the [[Industrial Revolution]], some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for [[loom]]s. More sophisticated electrical [[machine]]s did specialized [[analogue electronics|analog]] calculations in the early 20th century. The first [[Digital data|digital]] electronic calculating machines were developed during [[World War II]].  The speed, power, and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then.

Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one [[processing element]], typically a [[central processing unit]] (CPU), and some form of [[memory (computers)|memory]]. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored [[data|information]]. [[Peripheral]] devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era [[touchscreen]]). Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.

According to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', the first known use of the word "computer" was in 1613 in a book called ''The Yong Mans Gleanings'' by English writer Richard Braithwait: "I haue [sic] read the truest computer of Times, and the best Arithmetician that euer [sic] breathed, and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number." This usage of the term referred to a [[human computer]], a person who carried out calculations or computations. The word continued with the same meaning until the middle of the 20th century. Originally, women were often hired as "human computers" because they could be paid less than their male counterparts.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=23}} By 1943, most human computers were women.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=6}} From the end of the 19th century the word began to take on its more familiar meaning, a machine that carries out computations.&lt;ref name=OEDComputer&gt;{{Cite journal |title=computer, ''n.'' |series=Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/ |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=2 |year=1989 |accessdate=10 April 2009 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' gives the first attested use of "computer" in the "1640s, [meaning] "one who calculates,"; this is an "...&amp;nbsp;agent noun from compute (v.)". The ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' states that the use of the term to mean "calculating machine" (of any type) is from 1897."  The ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' indicates that the "modern use" of the term, to mean "programmable digital electronic computer" dates from "...&amp;nbsp;1945 under this name; [in a] theoretical [sense] from 1937, as [[Turing machine]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=computer|title=computer (n.)|website=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-20th century ===
[[File:Os d'Ishango IRSNB.JPG|thumb|upright=0.45|The [[Ishango bone]]]]
Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, mostly using [[one-to-one correspondence]] with [[finger counting|fingers]]. The earliest counting device was probably a form of [[tally stick]]. Later record keeping aids throughout the [[Fertile Crescent]] included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers.&lt;ref&gt;According to {{harvnb|Schmandt-Besserat|1981}}, these clay containers contained tokens, the total of which were the count of objects being transferred. The containers thus served as something of a [[bill of lading]] or an accounts book. In order to avoid breaking open the containers, first, clay impressions of the tokens were placed on the outside of the containers, for the count; the shapes of the impressions were abstracted into stylized marks; finally, the abstract marks were systematically used as numerals; these numerals were finally formalized as numbers. Eventually ([http://www.laits.utexas.edu/ghazal/Chap1/dsb/chapter1.html Schmandt-Besserat estimates it took 4000 years] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130084757/http://www.laits.utexas.edu/ghazal/Chap1/dsb/chapter1.html |date=30 January 2012 }} ) the marks on the outside of the containers were all that were needed to convey the count, and the clay containers evolved into clay tablets with marks for the count.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Eleanor|last=Robson|author-link=Eleanor Robson|year=2008|title=Mathematics in Ancient Iraq|publisher=|isbn=978-0-691-09182-2}}. p.&amp;nbsp;5: calculi were in use in Iraq for primitive accounting systems as early as 3200–3000 BCE, with commodity-specific counting representation systems. Balanced accounting was in use by 3000–2350 BCE, and a [[sexagesimal number system]] was in use 2350–2000 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[counting rods]] is one example.
[[File:Abacus 6.png|thumb|left|The Chinese [[Suanpan]] (算盘) (the number represented on this abacus is 6,302,715,408)]]
The [[abacus]] was initially used for arithmetic tasks. The [[Roman abacus]] was developed from devices used in [[Babylonia]] as early as 2400 BC. Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented. In a medieval European [[counting house]], a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money.

[[File:NAMA Machine d'Anticythère 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]]-designed [[Antikythera mechanism]], dating between 150 and 100 BC, is the world's oldest analog computer.]]
The [[Antikythera mechanism]] is believed to be the earliest mechanical analog "computer", according to [[Derek J. de Solla Price]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/project/general/the-project.html ''The Antikythera Mechanism Research Project''], The Antikythera Mechanism Research Project. Retrieved 1 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to calculate astronomical positions. It was discovered in 1901 in the [[Antikythera wreck]] off the Greek island of [[Antikythera]], between [[Kythera]] and [[Crete]], and has been dated to {{circa|100 BC}}. Devices of a level of complexity comparable to that of the Antikythera mechanism would not reappear until a thousand years later.

Many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use. The [[planisphere]] was a [[star chart]] invented by Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī in the early 11th century.&lt;ref name=Wiet&gt;G. Wiet, V. Elisseeff, P. Wolff, J. Naudu (1975). ''History of Mankind, Vol 3: The Great medieval Civilisations'', p. 649. George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, [[UNESCO]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[astrolabe]] was invented in the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic world]] in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and is often attributed to [[Hipparchus]]. A combination of the planisphere and [[dioptra]], the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in [[spherical astronomy]].

The [[Sector (instrument)|sector]], a calculating instrument used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication and division, and for various functions, such as squares and cube roots, was developed in the late 16th century and found application in gunnery, surveying and navigation.

The [[planimeter]] was a manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing over it with a mechanical linkage.

[[File:Sliderule 2005.png|thumb|A slide rule]]
The [[slide rule]] was invented around 1620–1630, shortly after the publication of the concept of the [[logarithm]]. It is a hand-operated analog computer for doing multiplication and division. As slide rule development progressed, added scales provided reciprocals, squares and square roots, cubes and cube roots, as well as [[transcendental function]]s such as logarithms and exponentials, circular and [[hyperbolic functions|hyperbolic]] [[trigonometry]] and other [[Function (mathematics)|functions]]. Slide rules with special scales are still used for quick performance of routine calculations, such as the [[E6B]] circular slide rule used for time and distance calculations on light aircraft.

In the 1770s, [[Pierre Jaquet-Droz]], a Swiss [[watchmaker]], built a mechanical doll ([[automata|automaton]]) that could write holding a quill pen. By switching the number and order of its internal wheels different letters, and hence different messages, could be produced. In effect, it could be mechanically "programmed" to read instructions. Along with two other complex machines, the doll is at the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire of [[Neuchâtel]], [[Switzerland]], and still operates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chonday.com/Videos/the-writer-automaton|title=The Writer Automaton, Switzerland|date=11 July 2013|publisher=chonday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tide-predicting machine]] invented by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Sir William Thomson]] in 1872 was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters. It used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location.

The [[differential analyser]], a mechanical analog computer designed to solve [[differential equations]] by [[integral|integration]], used wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration. In 1876, [[James Thomson (engineer)|Lord Kelvin]] had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators, but he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the [[ball-and-disk integrator]]s.&lt;ref name="scientific-computing.com"&gt;Ray Girvan, [http://www.scientific-computing.com/scwmayjun03computingmachines.html "The revealed grace of the mechanism: computing after Babbage"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103094710/http://www.scientific-computing.com/scwmayjun03computingmachines.html |date=3 November 2012 }}, ''Scientific Computing World'', May/June 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In a differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output. The [[torque amplifier]] was the advance that allowed these machines to work. Starting in the 1920s, [[Vannevar Bush]] and others developed mechanical differential analyzers.

=== First computing device ===
[[File:Difference engine plate 1853.jpg|thumb|A portion of [[Charles Babbage|Babbage's]] [[Difference engine]].]]
[[Charles Babbage]], an English mechanical engineer and [[polymath]], originated the concept of a programmable computer. Considered the "[[computer pioneer|father of the computer]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Halacy, Daniel Stephen | title = Charles Babbage, Father of the Computer | year = 1970 | publisher=Crowell-Collier Press | isbn = 0-02-741370-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he conceptualized and invented the first [[mechanical computer]] in the early 19th century. After working on his revolutionary [[difference engine]], designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an [[Analytical Engine]], was possible. The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via [[punched card]]s, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical [[loom]]s such as the [[Jacquard loom]]. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated an [[arithmetic logic unit]], [[control flow]] in the form of [[conditional branching]] and [[program loop#Loops|loops]], and integrated [[computer memory|memory]], making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as [[Turing-complete]].&lt;ref name="babbageonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/onlinestuff/stories/babbage.aspx?page=5|title=Babbage|work=Online stuff|publisher=Science Museum|date=19 January 2007 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20827915.500-lets-build-babbages-ultimate-mechanical-computer.html|title=Let's build Babbage's ultimate mechanical computer|work=opinion|publisher=New Scientist|date = 23 December 2010|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The machine was about a century ahead of its time. All the parts for his machine had to be made by hand&amp;nbsp;– this was a major problem for a device with thousands of parts. Eventually, the project was dissolved with the decision of the [[British Government]] to cease funding. Babbage's failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to difficulties not only of politics and financing, but also to his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow. Nevertheless, his son, Henry Babbage, completed a simplified version of the analytical engine's computing unit (the ''mill'') in 1888. He gave a successful demonstration of its use in computing tables in 1906.

=== Analog computers ===
[[File:099-tpm3-sk.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Sir William Thomson]]'s third tide-predicting machine design, 1879–81]]
During the first half of the 20th century, many scientific [[computing]] needs were met by increasingly sophisticated [[analog computer]]s, which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for [[computation]]. However, these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers.&lt;ref name="stanf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computing-history/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=The Modern History of Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern analog computer was a [[tide-predicting machine]], invented by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Sir William Thomson]] in 1872. The [[differential analyser]], a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration using wheel-and-disc mechanisms, was conceptualized in 1876 by [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]], the brother of the more famous Lord Kelvin.&lt;ref name="scientific-computing.com" /&gt;

The art of mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the [[differential analyzer]], built by H. L. Hazen and [[Vannevar Bush]] at [[MIT]] starting in 1927. This built on the mechanical integrators of [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]] and the torque amplifiers invented by H. W. Nieman. A dozen of these devices were built before their obsolescence became obvious. By the 1950s, the success of digital electronic computers had spelled the end for most analog computing machines, but analog computers remained in use during the 1950s in some specialized applications such as education ([[control systems]]) and aircraft ([[slide rule]]).

=== Digital computers ===
{{split section|Digital computer|date=May 2017}}

==== Electromechanical ====
By 1938, the [[United States Navy]] had developed an electromechanical analog computer small enough to use aboard a [[submarine]]. This was the [[Torpedo Data Computer]], which used trigonometry to solve the problem of firing a torpedo at a moving target. During [[World War II]] similar devices were developed in other countries as well.

[[File:Z3 Deutsches Museum.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Replica of [[Konrad Zuse|Zuse]]'s [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]], the first fully automatic, digital (electromechanical) computer.]]
Early digital computers were electromechanical; electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation. These devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers, originally using [[vacuum tube]]s. The [[Z2 (computer)|Z2]], created by German engineer [[Konrad Zuse]] in 1939, was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer.&lt;ref name="Part 4 Zuse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epemag.com/zuse/part4a.htm|title=Part 4:  Konrad Zuse's Z1 and Z3 Computers|last=Zuse|first=Horst|work=The Life and Work of Konrad Zuse|publisher=EPE Online|accessdate=17 June 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080601210541/http://www.epemag.com/zuse/part4a.htm |archivedate = 1 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Zuse followed his earlier machine up with the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]], the world's first working [[electromechanical]] [[Computer programming|programmable]], fully automatic digital computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Zuse|first=Konrad|author-link=Konrad Zuse|title=The Computer – My Life ''Translated by McKenna, Patricia and Ross, J.

It was quite similar to modern machines in some respects, pioneering numerous advances such as [[floating point number]]s. Rather than the harder-to-implement decimal system (used in [[Charles Babbage]]'s earlier design), using a [[binary numeral system|binary]] system meant that Zuse's machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable, given the technologies available at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://goremotesupport.com/blog/crash-the-story-of-it-zuse|title=Crash!

==== Vacuum tubes and digital electronic circuits ====
{{Anchor|Digital computer|Digital}}
Purely [[electronic circuit]] elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents, at the same time that digital calculation replaced analog. The engineer [[Tommy Flowers]], working at the [[Post Office Research Station]] in [[London]] in the 1930s, began to explore the possible use of electronics for the [[telephone exchange]]. Experimental equipment that he built in 1934 went into operation five years later, converting a portion of the [[telephone exchange]] network into an electronic data processing system, using thousands of [[vacuum tube]]s.&lt;ref name="stanf" /&gt; In the US, [[John Vincent Atanasoff]] and [[Clifford Berry|Clifford E.

During World War II, the British at [[Bletchley Park]] achieved a number of successes at breaking encrypted German military communications.

Colossus was the world's first [[electronics|electronic]] [[Digital electronics|digital]] [[Computer programming|programmable]] computer.&lt;ref name="stanf" /&gt; It used a large number of valves (vacuum tubes). It had paper-tape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of [[boolean logic]]al operations on its data, but it was not [[Turing-complete]]. Nine Mk II Colossi were built (The Mk I was converted to a Mk II making ten machines in total). Colossus Mark I contained 1,500 thermionic valves (tubes), but Mark II with 2,400 valves, was both 5 times faster and simpler to operate than Mark I, greatly speeding the decoding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Randell|first1=Brian|author-link1=Brian Randell|last2=Fensom|first2=Harry|last3=Milne|first3=Frank A.|title=Obituary: Allen Coombs|newspaper=The Independent|date=15 March 1995|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-allen-coombs-1611270.html|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Fensom|first=Jim|title=Harry Fensom obituary|date=8 November 2010|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/nov/08/harry-fensom-obituary|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eniac.jpg|thumb|left|[[ENIAC]] was the first electronic, Turing-complete device, and performed ballistics trajectory calculations for the [[United States Army]].]]
The U.S.-built [[ENIAC]]&lt;ref&gt;John Presper Eckert Jr. and John W. Mauchly, Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, United States Patent Office, US Patent 3,120,606, filed 26 June 1947, issued 4 February 1964, and invalidated 19 October 1973 after court ruling on ''[[Honeywell v. Sperry Rand]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first electronic programmable computer built in the US. Although the ENIAC was similar to the Colossus, it was much faster, more flexible, and it was [[Turing-complete]]. Like the Colossus, a "program" on the ENIAC was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches, a far cry from the [[stored program]] electronic machines that came later. Once a program was written, it had to be mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting of plugs and switches. The programmers of the ENIAC were six women, often known collectively as the "ENIAC girls".{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=39}}{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=459}}

It combined the high speed of electronics with the ability to be programmed for many complex problems. It could add or subtract 5000 times a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine. It also had modules to multiply, divide, and square root. High speed memory was limited to 20 words (about 80 bytes). Built under the direction of [[John Mauchly]] and [[J. Presper Eckert]] at the University of Pennsylvania, ENIAC's development and construction lasted from 1943 to full operation at the end of 1945. The machine was huge, weighing 30 tons, using 200 kilowatts of electric power and contained over 18,000 vacuum tubes, 1,500 relays, and hundreds of thousands of resistors, capacitors, and inductors.&lt;ref name="Eniac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techiwarehouse.com/engine/a046ee08/Generations-of-Computer|title=Generations of Computer|publisher=techiwarehouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern computers ===

==== Concept of modern computer ====
The principle of the modern computer was proposed by [[Alan Turing]] in his seminal 1936 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://plms.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/s2-42/1/230|doi=10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230|title=On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem|first=A. M.|last=Turing|journal=Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society|year=1937|series=2|volume=42|number=1|pages=230–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''On Computable Numbers''. Turing proposed a simple device that he called "Universal Computing machine" and that is now known as a [[universal Turing machine]]. He proved that such a machine is capable of computing anything that is computable by executing instructions (program) stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable. The fundamental concept of Turing's design is the [[stored program]], where all the instructions for computing are stored in memory. [[John von Neumann|Von Neumann]] acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper.&lt;ref&gt;"von Neumann&amp;nbsp;... firmly emphasized to me, and to others I am sure, that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing—insofar as not anticipated by Babbage, Lovelace and others." Letter by [[Stanley Frankel]] to [[Brian Randell]], 1972, quoted in [[Jack Copeland]] (2004) ''The Essential Turing'', p22.&lt;/ref&gt; Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in [[theory of computation]]. Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores, modern computers are said to be [[Turing-complete]], which is to say, they have [[algorithm]] execution capability equivalent to a universal Turing machine.

==== Stored programs ====
[[File:SSEM Manchester museum close up.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=Three tall racks containing electronic circuit boards|A section of the [[Manchester Baby]], the first electronic stored-program computer]]
Early computing machines had fixed programs. Changing its function required the re-wiring and re-structuring of the machine.&lt;ref name="Copeland2006" /&gt; With the proposal of the stored-program computer this changed. A stored-program computer includes by design an [[instruction set]] and can store in memory a set of instructions (a [[computer program|program]]) that details the [[computation]]. The theoretical basis for the stored-program computer was laid by [[Alan Turing]] in his 1936 paper. In 1945, Turing joined the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] and began work on developing an electronic stored-program digital computer. His 1945 report "Proposed Electronic Calculator" was the first specification for such a device. John von Neumann at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] also circulated his ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]'' in 1945.&lt;ref name="stanf" /&gt;

The [[Manchester Baby]] was the world's first [[stored-program computer]]. It was built at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] by [[Frederic Calland Williams|Frederic C. Williams]], [[Tom Kilburn]] and [[Geoff Tootill]], and ran its first program on 21 June 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Enticknap |first=Nicholas |title=Computing's Golden Jubilee |journal=Resurrection |issue=20 |publisher=The Computer Conservation Society |date=Summer 1998 |url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res20.htm#d |issn=0958-7403 |accessdate=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed as a [[testbed]] for the [[Williams tube]], the first [[Random-access memory|random-access]] digital storage device.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Early computers at Manchester University|journal=Resurrection|volume=1|issue=4|publisher=The Computer Conservation Society|date=Summer 1992|url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res04.htm#g|issn=0958-7403|accessdate=7 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828010743/http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res04.htm#g|archive-date=28 August 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the computer was considered "small and primitive" by the standards of its time, it was the first working machine to contain all of the elements essential to a modern electronic computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.computer50.org/mark1/contemporary.html|title=Early Electronic Computers (1946–51)|publisher=University of Manchester|accessdate=16 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105031620/http://www.computer50.org/mark1/contemporary.html|archivedate=5 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as the Baby had demonstrated the feasibility of its design, a project was initiated at the university to develop it into a more usable computer, the [[Manchester Mark 1]].

The Mark 1 in turn quickly became the prototype for the [[Ferranti Mark 1]], the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer.&lt;ref name=NapperMK1&gt;{{citation |last=Napper |first=R.

==== Transistors ====
&lt;!-- [[Second generation of computers]] redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Transistor-die-KSY34.jpg|thumb|right|A [[bipolar junction transistor]]]]
The bipolar [[transistor]] was invented in 1947. From 1955 onwards transistors replaced [[vacuum tube]]s in computer designs, giving rise to the "second generation" of computers.
Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors have many advantages: they are smaller, and require less power than vacuum tubes, so give off less heat. Silicon junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer, indefinite, service life. Transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space.

At the [[University of Manchester]], a team under the leadership of [[Tom Kilburn]] designed and built a machine using the newly developed [[transistor]]s instead of valves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lavington|first=Simon|title=A History of Manchester Computers|year=1998|edition=2|publisher=The British Computer Society|location=Swindon|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first [[transistor computer|transistorised computer]] and the first in the world, was [[Manchester computers#Transistor Computer|operational by 1953]], and a second version was completed there in April 1955. However, the machine did make use of valves to generate its 125&amp;nbsp;kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic [[drum memory]], so it was not the first completely transistorized computer. That distinction goes to the [[Harwell CADET]] of 1955,&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee"&gt;{{citation |doi=10.1049/esej:19980301 |last=Cooke-Yarborough |first=E.

==== Integrated circuits ====
The next great advance in computing power came with the advent of the [[integrated circuit]].
The idea of the integrated circuit was first conceived by a radar scientist working for the [[Royal Radar Establishment]] of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], [[Geoffrey Dummer|Geoffrey W.A. Dummer]]. Dummer presented the first public description of an integrated circuit at the Symposium on Progress in Quality Electronic Components in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington,&amp;nbsp;D.C.]] on 7 May 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epn-online.com/page/22909/the-hapless-tale-of-geoffrey-dummer-this-is-the-sad-.html "The Hapless Tale of Geoffrey Dummer"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181443/http://www.epn-online.com/page/22909/the-hapless-tale-of-geoffrey-dummer-this-is-the-sad-.html |date=11 May 2013 }}, (n.d.), (HTML), ''Electronic Product News'', accessed 8 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first practical ICs were invented by [[Jack Kilby]] at [[Texas Instruments]] and [[Robert Noyce]] at [[Fairchild Semiconductor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Jack|last=Kilby|author-link=Jack Kilby|title=Nobel lecture|publisher=Nobel Foundation|year=2000|location=Stockholm|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2000/kilby-lecture.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July 1958, successfully demonstrating the first working integrated example on 12 September 1958.&lt;ref name="TIJackBuilt"&gt;[http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/kilbyctr/jackbuilt.shtml ''The Chip that Jack Built''], (c. 2008), (HTML), Texas Instruments, Retrieved 29 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In his patent application of 6 February 1959, Kilby described his new device as "a body of semiconductor material&amp;nbsp;... wherein all the components of the electronic circuit are completely integrated".&lt;ref&gt;Jack S. Kilby, Miniaturized Electronic Circuits, United States Patent Office, US Patent 3,138,743, filed 6 February 1959, issued 23 June 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Winston| first = Brian| title = Media Technology and Society: A History : From the Telegraph to the Internet| url = https://books.google.com/?id=gfeCXlElJTwC&amp;pg=PA221| year = 1998| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0-415-14230-4| page = 221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Noyce also came up with his own idea of an integrated circuit half a year later than Kilby.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Noyce]]'s Unitary circuit, {{Ref patent |country=US |number=2981877|status=patent|gdate=1961-04-25|title=Semiconductor device-and-lead structure |assign1 =[[Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His chip solved many practical problems that Kilby's had not. Produced at Fairchild Semiconductor, it was made of [[silicon]], whereas Kilby's chip was made of [[germanium]].

This new development heralded an explosion in the commercial and personal use of computers and led to the invention of the [[microprocessor]]. While the subject of exactly which device was the first microprocessor is contentious, partly due to lack of agreement on the exact definition of the term "microprocessor", it is largely undisputed that the first single-chip microprocessor was the [[Intel 4004]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Intel's First Microprocessor—the Intel 4004 |publisher=Intel Corp. |date=November 1971 |url=http://www.intel.com/museum/archives/4004.htm |accessdate=17 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513221700/http://www.intel.com/museum/archives/4004.htm |archivedate=13 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; designed and realized by [[Marcian Hoff|Ted Hoff]], [[Federico Faggin]], and Stanley Mazor at [[Intel]].&lt;ref&gt;The Intel 4004 (1971) die was 12&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, composed of 2300 transistors; by comparison, the Pentium Pro was 306&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, composed of 5.5&amp;nbsp;million transistors, according to {{citation|last1= Patterson |first1= David |last2= Hennessy|first2= John|year=1998|title= Computer Organization and Design |location= San Francisco|publisher=[[Morgan Kaufmann]]|isbn = 1-55860-428-6|pages=27–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobile computers ===

The first [[portable computer|mobile computers]] were heavy and ran from mains power. The 50lb [[IBM 5100]] was an early example. Later portables such as the [[Osborne 1]] and [[Compaq Portable]] were considerably lighter, but still needed to be plugged in. The first [[laptop]]s, such as the [[Grid Compass]], removed this requirement by incorporating batteries – and with the continued miniaturization of computing resources and advancements in portable battery life, portable computers grew in popularity in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2008/12/global-notebook-shipments-finally-overtake-desktops/|title=Global notebook shipments finally overtake desktops|work=Ars Technica|first=David|last=Chartier|date=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same developments allowed manufacturers to integrate computing resources into cellular phones.

These [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer|tablets]] run on a variety of operating systems and soon became the dominant computing device on the market, with manufacturers reporting having shipped an estimated 237 million devices in 2Q 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=IDC|title=Growth Accelerates in the Worldwide Mobile Phone and Smartphone Markets in the Second Quarter, According to IDC|date=25 July 2013|url=http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24239313|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626022208/http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24239313|archive-date=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A general purpose computer has four main components: the [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU), the [[control unit]], the [[Computer data storage|memory]], and the [[input and output devices]] (collectively termed I/O). These parts are interconnected by [[bus (computing)|buses]], often made of groups of [[wire]]s.
Inside each of these parts are thousands to trillions of small [[electrical network|electrical circuits]] which can be turned off or on by means of an [[transistor|electronic switch]]. Each circuit represents a [[bit]] (binary digit) of information so that when the circuit is on it represents a "1", and when off it represents a "0" (in positive logic representation). The circuits are arranged in [[logic gate]]s so that one or more of the circuits may control the state of one or more of the other circuits.

=== Input devices ===
When unprocessed data is sent to the computer with the help of input devices, the data is processed and sent to output devices. The input devices may be hand-operated or automated. The act of processing is mainly regulated by the CPU. Some examples of input devices are:
* [[Computer keyboard]]
* [[Digital camera]]
* [[Digital video]]
* [[Graphics tablet]]
* [[Image scanner]]
* [[Joystick]]
* [[Microphone]]
* [[Mouse (computing)|Mouse]]
* [[Overlay keyboard]]
* [[Real-time clock]]
* [[Trackball]]
* [[Touchscreen]]

=== Output devices ===
The means through which computer gives output are known as output devices. Some examples of output devices are:
* [[Computer monitor]]
* [[Printer (computing)|Printer]]
* [[PC speaker]]
* [[Projector]]
* [[Sound card]]
* [[Video card]]

=== Control unit ===
{{Main|CPU design|Control unit}}
[[File:Mips32 addi.svg|thumb|right|Diagram showing how a particular [[MIPS architecture]] instruction would be decoded by the control system]]

The control unit (often called a control system or central controller) manages the computer's various components; it reads and interprets (decodes) the program instructions, transforming them into control signals that activate other parts of the computer.&lt;ref&gt;The control unit's role in interpreting instructions has varied somewhat in the past. Although the control unit is solely responsible for instruction interpretation in most modern computers, this is not always the case. Some computers have instructions that are partially interpreted by the control unit with further interpretation performed by another device. For example, [[EDVAC]], one of the earliest stored-program computers, used a central control unit that only interpreted four instructions. All of the arithmetic-related instructions were passed on to its arithmetic unit and further decoded there.&lt;/ref&gt; Control systems in advanced computers may change the order of execution of some instructions to improve performance.

A key component common to all CPUs is the [[program counter]], a special memory cell (a [[processor register|register]]) that keeps track of which location in memory the next instruction is to be read from.&lt;ref&gt;Instructions often occupy more than one memory address, therefore the program counter usually increases by the number of memory locations required to store one instruction.&lt;/ref&gt;

The control system's function is as follows—note that this is a simplified description, and some of these steps may be performed concurrently or in a different order depending on the type of CPU:

# Read the code for the next instruction from the cell indicated by the program counter.
# Decode the numerical code for the instruction into a set of commands or signals for each of the other systems.
# Increment the program counter so it points to the next instruction.
# Read whatever data the instruction requires from cells in memory (or perhaps from an input device). The location of this required data is typically stored within the instruction code.
# Provide the necessary data to an ALU or register.
# If the instruction requires an ALU or specialized hardware to complete, instruct the hardware to perform the requested operation.
# Write the result from the ALU back to a memory location or to a register or perhaps an output device.
# Jump back to step (1).

Since the program counter is (conceptually) just another set of memory cells, it can be changed by calculations done in the ALU. Adding 100 to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place 100 locations further down the program. Instructions that modify the program counter are often known as "jumps" and allow for loops (instructions that are repeated by the computer) and often conditional instruction execution (both examples of [[control flow]]).

The sequence of operations that the control unit goes through to process an instruction is in itself like a short computer program, and indeed, in some more complex CPU designs, there is another yet smaller computer called a [[microsequencer]], which runs a [[microcode]] program that causes all of these events to happen.

=== Central processing unit (CPU) ===
The control unit, ALU, and registers are collectively known as a [[central processing unit]] (CPU). Early CPUs were composed of many separate components but since the mid-1970s CPUs have typically been constructed on a single [[integrated circuit]] called a ''[[microprocessor]]''.

=== Arithmetic logic unit (ALU) ===
{{Main|Arithmetic logic unit}}

The ALU is capable of performing two classes of operations: arithmetic and logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
 | title = The Most Complex Machine: A Survey of Computers and Computing

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to addition and subtraction, or might include multiplication, division, [[trigonometry]] functions such as sine, cosine, etc., and [[square root]]s. Some can only operate on whole numbers ([[integer]]s) while others use [[floating point]] to represent [[real number]]s, albeit with limited precision. However, any computer that is capable of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed to break down the more complex operations into simple steps that it can perform. Therefore, any computer can be programmed to perform any arithmetic operation—although it will take more time to do so if its ALU does not directly support the operation. An ALU may also compare numbers and return [[Truth value|boolean truth values]] (true or false) depending on whether one is equal to, greater than or less than the other ("is 64 greater than 65?"). Logic operations involve [[Boolean logic]]: [[logical conjunction|AND]], [[logical disjunction|OR]], [[Exclusive or|XOR]], and [[Negation|NOT]]. These can be useful for creating complicated [[conditional (programming)|conditional statements]] and processing [[boolean logic]].

[[Superscalar]] computers may contain multiple ALUs, allowing them to process several instructions simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Handbook of Parallel Computing and Statistics | author = Erricos John Kontoghiorghes | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-8247-4067-2 | page = 45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graphics processing unit|Graphics processors]] and computers with [[SIMD]] and [[MIMD]] features often contain ALUs that can perform arithmetic on [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] and [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]].

=== Memory ===
{{Main|Computer data storage}}
[[File:Magnetic core.jpg|thumb|right|[[Magnetic core memory]] was the computer memory of choice throughout the 1960s, until it was replaced by semiconductor memory.]]

A computer's memory can be viewed as a list of cells into which numbers can be placed or read. Each cell has a numbered "address" and can store a single number. The computer can be instructed to "put the number 123 into the cell numbered 1357" or to "add the number that is in cell 1357 to the number that is in cell 2468 and put the answer into cell 1595." The information stored in memory may represent practically anything. Letters, numbers, even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease. Since the CPU does not differentiate between different types of information, it is the software's responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers.

In almost all modern computers, each memory cell is set up to store [[binary numeral system|binary numbers]] in groups of eight bits (called a [[byte]]). Each byte is able to represent 256 different numbers (2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; = 256); either from 0 to 255 or −128 to +127. To store larger numbers, several consecutive bytes may be used (typically, two, four or eight). When negative numbers are required, they are usually stored in [[two's complement]] notation. Other arrangements are possible, but are usually not seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts. A computer can store any kind of information in memory if it can be represented numerically. Modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory.

The CPU contains a special set of memory cells called [[Processor register|registers]] that can be read and written to much more rapidly than the main memory area. There are typically between two and one hundred registers depending on the type of CPU. Registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed. As data is constantly being worked on, reducing the need to access main memory (which is often slow compared to the ALU and control units) greatly increases the computer's speed.

Computer main memory comes in two principal varieties:
* [[random-access memory]] or RAM
* [[read-only memory]] or ROM
RAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it, but ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes, therefore the CPU can only read from it. ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions. In general, the contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data indefinitely. In a PC, the ROM contains a specialized program called the [[BIOS]] that orchestrates loading the computer's [[operating system]] from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset. In [[embedded system|embedded computers]], which frequently do not have disk drives, all of the required software may be stored in ROM. Software stored in ROM is often called [[firmware]], because it is notionally more like hardware than software. [[Flash memory]] blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM, as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable. It is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM however, so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Flash memory also may only be rewritten a limited number of times before wearing out, making it less useful for heavy random access usage. {{harv|Verma &amp; Mielke|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more sophisticated computers there may be one or more RAM [[CPU cache|cache memories]], which are slower than registers but faster than main memory. Generally computers with this sort of cache are designed to move frequently needed data into the cache automatically, often without the need for any intervention on the programmer's part.

=== Input/output (I/O) ===
{{Main|Input/output}}
[[File:HDDspin.JPG|thumb|right|[[Hard disk drive]]s are common storage devices used with computers.]]
I/O is the means by which a computer exchanges information with the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Introduction to the Basic Computer | author = Donald Eadie | year = 1968 | publisher = Prentice-Hall | page = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Devices that provide input or output to the computer are called [[peripheral]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Introduction to Microcomputers and the Microprocessors | author = Arpad Barna |author2=Dan I. Porat | publisher = Wiley | year = 1976 | isbn = 978-0-471-05051-3 | page = 85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On a typical personal computer, peripherals include input devices like the keyboard and [[mouse (computing)|mouse]], and output devices such as the [[computer monitor|display]] and [[printer (computing)|printer]]. [[Hard disk drive]]s, [[floppy disk]] drives and [[optical disc drive]]s serve as both input and output devices. [[Computer networking]] is another form of I/O.
I/O devices are often complex computers in their own right, with their own CPU and memory. A [[graphics processing unit]] might contain fifty or more tiny computers that perform the calculations necessary to display [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Modern [[desktop computer]]s contain many smaller computers that assist the main CPU in performing I/O. A 2016-era flat screen display contains its own computer circuitry.

=== Multitasking ===
{{Main|Computer multitasking}}
While a computer may be viewed as running one gigantic program stored in its main memory, in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance of running several programs simultaneously. This is achieved by multitasking i.e. having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Learning the UNIX Operating System: A Concise Guide for the New User | author = Jerry Peek |author2=Grace Todino |author3=John Strang  | publisher = O'Reilly | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-596-00261-9 | page = 130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One means by which this is done is with a special signal called an [[interrupt]], which can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead. By remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt, the computer can return to that task later. If several programs are running "at the same time". then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second, causing a program switch each time. Since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception, it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant. This method of multitasking is sometimes termed "time-sharing" since each program is allocated a "slice" of time in turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Noise Reduction in Speech Applications | author = Gillian M. Davis | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-8493-0949-6 | page = 111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the era of inexpensive computers, the principal use for multitasking was to allow many people to share the same computer. Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running, but most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks. If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a "time slice" until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss.

=== Multiprocessing ===
{{Main|Multiprocessing}}
[[File:Cray 2 Arts et Metiers dsc03940.jpg|thumb|[[Cray]] designed many supercomputers that used multiprocessing heavily.]]
Some computers are designed to distribute their work across several CPUs in a multiprocessing configuration, a technique once employed only in large and powerful machines such as [[supercomputer]]s, [[mainframe computer]]s and [[server (computing)|servers]]. Multiprocessor and [[multi-core]] (multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit) personal and laptop computers are now widely available, and are being increasingly used in lower-end markets as a result.

Supercomputers in particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from the basic stored-program architecture and from general purpose computers.&lt;ref&gt;However, it is also very common to construct supercomputers out of many pieces of cheap commodity hardware; usually individual computers connected by networks. These so-called [[computer cluster]]s can often provide supercomputer performance at a much lower cost than customized designs. While custom architectures are still used for most of the most powerful supercomputers, there has been a proliferation of cluster computers in recent years. {{harv|TOP500|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often feature thousands of CPUs, customized high-speed interconnects, and specialized computing hardware. Such designs tend to be useful only for specialized tasks due to the large scale of program organization required to successfully utilize most of the available resources at once. Supercomputers usually see usage in large-scale [[Computer simulation|simulation]], [[Rendering (computer graphics)|graphics rendering]], and [[cryptography]] applications, as well as with other so-called "[[embarrassingly parallel]]" tasks.

== Software ==
{{Main|Computer software}}
''Software'' refers to parts of the computer which do not have a material form, such as programs, data, protocols, etc. Software is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical [[Computer hardware|hardware]] from which the system is built. Computer software includes [[computer program]]s, [[Library (computing)|libraries]] and related non-executable [[Data (computing)|data]], such as [[Software documentation|online documentation]] or [[digital media]]. It is often divided into [[system software]] and application software]] Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own. When software is stored in hardware that cannot easily be modified, such as with [[BIOS]] [[Read-only memory|ROM]] in an [[IBM PC compatible]] computer, it is sometimes called "firmware".

=== Application Software ===

=== Programs ===
The defining feature of modern computers which distinguishes them from all other machines is that they can be [[computer programming|programmed]]. That is to say that some type of [[Instruction (computer science)|instructions]] (the [[Computer program|program]]) can be given to the computer, and it will process them. Modern computers based on the [[von Neumann architecture]] often have machine code in the form of an [[imperative programming language]]. In practical terms, a computer program may be just a few instructions or extend to many millions of instructions, as do the programs for [[word processor]]s and [[web browser]]s for example. A typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions per second ([[FLOPS|gigaflops]]) and rarely makes a mistake over many years of operation. Large computer programs consisting of several million instructions may take teams of [[programmer]]s years to write, and due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors.

==== Stored program architecture ====
{{Main|Computer program|Computer programming}}
[[File:SSEM Manchester museum.jpg|thumb|right|Replica of the [[Manchester Baby]], the world's first electronic [[stored-program computer]], at the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Manchester)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in Manchester, England]]
This section applies to most common [[RAM machine]]–based computers.

In most cases, computer instructions are simple: add one number to another, move some data from one location to another, send a message to some external device, etc. These instructions are read from the computer's [[Computer data storage|memory]] and are generally carried out ([[execution (computing)|executed]]) in the order they were given. However, there are usually specialized instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from there. These are called "jump" instructions (or [[Branch (computer science)|branches]]). Furthermore, jump instructions may be made to happen [[conditional (programming)|conditionally]] so that different sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation or some external event. Many computers directly support [[subroutine]]s by providing a type of jump that "remembers" the location it jumped from and another instruction to return to the instruction following that jump instruction.

Program execution might be likened to reading a book. While a person will normally read each word and line in sequence, they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest. Similarly, a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until some internal condition is met. This is called the [[control flow|flow of control]] within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention.

Comparatively, a person using a pocket [[calculator]] can perform a basic arithmetic operation such as adding two numbers with just a few button presses. But to add together all of the numbers from 1 to 1,000 would take thousands of button presses and a lot of time, with a near certainty of making a mistake. On the other hand, a computer may be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions. The following example is written in the [[MIPS architecture|MIPS assembly language]]:
{{Clear}}
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="asm"&gt;
  begin:
  addi $8, $0, 0           # initialize sum to 0
  addi $9, $0, 1           # set first number to add = 1
  loop:
  slti $10, $9, 1000       # check if the number is less than 1000
  beq $10, $0, finish      # if odd number is greater than n then exit
  add $8, $8, $9           # update sum
  addi $9, $9, 1           # get next number
  j loop                   # repeat the summing process
  finish:
  add $2, $8, $0           # put sum in output register
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Once told to run this program, the computer will perform the repetitive addition task without further human intervention. It will almost never make a mistake and a modern PC can complete the task in a fraction of a second.

==== Machine code ====
In most computers, individual instructions are stored as [[machine code]] with each instruction being given a unique number (its operation code or [[opcode]] for short). The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode; the command to multiply them would have a different opcode, and so on. The simplest computers are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions; the more complex computers have several hundred to choose from, each with a unique numerical code. Since the computer's memory is able to store numbers, it can also store the instruction codes. This leads to the important fact that entire programs (which are just lists of these instructions) can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer in the same way as numeric data. The fundamental concept of storing programs in the computer's memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux of the von Neumann, or stored program{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}, architecture. In some cases, a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that is kept separate from the data it operates on. This is called the [[Harvard architecture]] after the [[Harvard Mark I]] computer. Modern von Neumann computers display some traits of the Harvard architecture in their designs, such as in [[CPU cache]]s.

While it is possible to write computer programs as long lists of numbers ([[machine code|machine language]]) and while this technique was used with many early computers,&lt;ref&gt;Even some later computers were commonly programmed directly in machine code. Some [[minicomputer]]s like the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-8]] could be programmed directly from a panel of switches. However, this method was usually used only as part of the [[booting]] process. Most modern computers boot entirely automatically by reading a boot program from some [[non-volatile memory]].&lt;/ref&gt; it is extremely tedious and potentially error-prone to do so in practice, especially for complicated programs. Instead, each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative of its function and easy to remember&amp;nbsp;– a [[mnemonic]] such as ADD, SUB, MULT or JUMP. These mnemonics are collectively known as a computer's [[assembly language]]. Converting programs written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand (machine language) is usually done by a computer program called an assembler.

[[File:FortranCardPROJ039.agr.jpg|thumb|right|A 1970s [[punched card]] containing one line from a [[Fortran]] program. The card reads: "Z(1) = Y + W(1)" and is labeled "PROJ039" for identification purposes.]]

==== Programming language ====
{{Main|Programming language}}
Programming languages provide various ways of specifying programs for computers to run. Unlike [[natural language]]s, programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise. They are purely written languages and are often difficult to read aloud. They are generally either translated into [[machine code]] by a [[compiler]] or an [[assembler (computer programming)|assembler]] before being run, or translated directly at run time by an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]]. Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques.

===== Low-level languages =====
{{Main|Low-level programming language}}
Machine languages and the assembly languages that represent them (collectively termed ''low-level programming languages'') tend to be unique to a particular type of computer. For instance, an [[ARM architecture]] computer (such as may be found in a [[smartphone]] or a [[handheld video game|hand-held videogame]]) cannot understand the machine language of an [[x86]] CPU that might be in a [[Personal computer|PC]].&lt;ref&gt;However, there is sometimes some form of machine language compatibility between different computers. An [[x86-64]] compatible microprocessor like the [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[Athlon 64]] is able to run most of the same programs that an [[Intel Core 2]] microprocessor can, as well as programs designed for earlier microprocessors like the Intel [[Pentium]]s and [[Intel 80486]]. This contrasts with very early commercial computers, which were often one-of-a-kind and totally incompatible with other computers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== High-level languages/third generation language =====
{{Main|High-level programming language}}
Although considerably easier than in machine language, writing long programs in assembly language is often difficult and is also error prone. Therefore, most practical programs are written in more abstract [[high-level programming language]]s that are able to express the needs of the [[programmer]] more conveniently (and thereby help reduce programmer error). High level languages are usually "compiled" into machine language (or sometimes into assembly language and then into machine language) using another computer program called a [[compiler]].&lt;ref&gt;High level languages are also often [[interpreted language|interpreted]] rather than compiled. Interpreted languages are translated into machine code on the fly, while running, by another program called an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].&lt;/ref&gt; High level languages are less related to the workings of the target computer than assembly language, and more related to the language and structure of the problem(s) to be solved by the final program. It is therefore often possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language of many different types of computer. This is part of the means by which software like video games may be made available for different computer architectures such as personal computers and various [[video game console]]s.

==== Fourth-generation languages ====
{{Main|Fourth-generation programming language}}
Fourth-generation languages (4GL) are less procedural than 3G languages. The benefit of 4GL is that they provide ways to obtain information without requiring the direct help of a programmer.

==== Program design ====
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
Program design of small programs is relatively simple and involves the analysis of the problem, collection of inputs, using the programming constructs within languages, devising or using established procedures and algorithms, providing data for output devices and solutions to the problem as applicable. As problems become larger and more complex, features such as subprograms, modules, formal documentation, and new paradigms such as object-oriented programming are encountered. Large programs involving thousands of line of code and more require formal software methodologies.
The task of developing large [[Computer software|software]] systems presents a significant intellectual challenge. Producing software with an acceptably high reliability within a predictable schedule and budget has historically been difficult; the academic and professional discipline of [[software engineering]] concentrates specifically on this challenge.

==== Bugs ====
{{Main|Software bug}}
[[File:H96566k.jpg|thumb|The actual first computer bug, a moth found trapped on a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer]]
Errors in computer programs are called "[[Software bug|bugs]]". They may be benign and not affect the usefulness of the program, or have only subtle effects. But in some cases, they may cause the program or the entire system to "[[Hang (computing)|hang]]", becoming unresponsive to input such as [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] clicks or keystrokes, to completely fail, or to [[Crash (computing)|crash]]. Otherwise benign bugs may sometimes be harnessed for malicious intent by an unscrupulous user writing an [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]], code designed to take advantage of a bug and disrupt a computer's proper execution. Bugs are usually not the fault of the computer. Since computers merely execute the instructions they are given, bugs are nearly always the result of programmer error or an oversight made in the program's design.&lt;ref&gt;It is not universally true that bugs are solely due to programmer oversight. Computer hardware may fail or may itself have a fundamental problem that produces unexpected results in certain situations. For instance, the [[Pentium FDIV bug]] caused some [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] [[microprocessor]]s in the early 1990s to produce inaccurate results for certain [[floating point]] division operations. This was caused by a flaw in the microprocessor design and resulted in a partial recall of the affected devices.&lt;/ref&gt;
Admiral [[Grace Hopper]], an American computer scientist and developer of the first [[compiler]], is credited for having first used the term "bugs" in computing after a dead moth was found shorting a relay in the [[Harvard Mark II]] computer in September 1947.&lt;ref name="taylor84"&gt;{{cite news

Firmware is the technology which has the combination of both hardware and software such as BIOS chip inside a computer. This chip (hardware) is located on the motherboard and has the BIOS set up (software) stored in it.

== Networking and the Internet ==
{{Main|Computer networking|Internet}}
[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|left|Visualization of a portion of the [[Routing|routes]] on the Internet]]
Computers have been used to coordinate information between multiple locations since the 1950s. The U.S. military's [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] system was the first large-scale example of such a system, which led to a number of special-purpose commercial systems such as [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Systems, Experts, and Computers | author = Agatha C. Hughes | publisher = [[MIT Press]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-262-08285-3 | page = 161 | quote = The experience of SAGE helped make possible the first truly large-scale commercial real-time network: the SABRE computerized airline reservations system&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, computer engineers at research institutions throughout the United States began to link their computers together using telecommunications technology. The effort was funded by ARPA (now [[DARPA]]), and the [[computer network]] that resulted was called the [[ARPANET]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of the Internet|url=http://www.isoc.org/internet/history/brief.shtml|publisher=[[Internet Society]]|accessdate=20 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technologies that made the Arpanet possible spread and evolved.

In time, the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the Internet. The emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer. Computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network, such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the like, as extensions of the resources of an individual computer. Initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of applications like e-mail and the [[World Wide Web]], combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies like [[Ethernet]] and [[Asymmetric digital subscriber line|ADSL]] saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous. In fact, the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally. A very large proportion of personal computers regularly connect to the Internet to communicate and receive information. "Wireless" networking, often utilizing mobile phone networks, has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments.

== Unconventional computers ==
{{Main|Human computer}}
{{See also|Harvard Computers}}
A computer does not need to be [[electronics|electronic]], nor even have a [[Central processing unit|processor]], nor [[Random-access memory|RAM]], nor even a [[hard disk]]. While popular usage of the word "computer" is synonymous with a personal electronic computer, the modern&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (6th ed, 2007), the word ''computer'' dates back to the mid 17th century, when it referred to "A person who makes calculations; specifically a person employed for this in an observatory etc."&lt;/ref&gt; definition of a computer is literally: "''A device that computes'', especially a programmable [usually] electronic machine that performs high-speed mathematical or logical operations or that assembles, stores, correlates, or otherwise processes information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefreedictionary.com/computer |title=Definition of computer|publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any device which ''processes information'' qualifies as a computer, especially if the processing is purposeful.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== Unconventional computing ==
{{further|Unconventional computing}}
Historically, computers evolved from [[mechanical computer]]s and eventually from [[vacuum tube]]s to [[transistor]]s. However, conceptually computational systems as [[Turing complete|flexible]] as a personal computer can be built out of almost anything. For example, a computer can be made out of billiard balls ([[billiard ball computer]]); an often quoted example.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} More realistically, modern computers are made out of [[transistors]] made of [[photolithography|photolithographed]] [[semiconductors]].

== Future ==
There is active research to make computers out of many promising new types of technology, such as [[optical computing|optical computers]], [[DNA computing|DNA computers]], [[wetware computer|neural computers]], and [[quantum computing|quantum computers]]. Most computers are universal, and are able to calculate any [[computable function]], and are limited only by their memory capacity and operating speed. However different designs of computers can give very different performance for particular problems; for example quantum computers can potentially break some modern encryption algorithms (by [[Shor's algorithm|quantum factoring]]) very quickly.

=== Computer architecture paradigms ===
There are many types of [[computer architecture]]s:
* [[Quantum computer]] vs. [[Chemical computer]]
* [[Scalar processor]] vs. [[Vector processor]]
* [[Non-Uniform Memory Access]] (NUMA) computers
* [[Register machine]] vs. [[Stack machine]]
* [[Harvard architecture]] vs. [[von Neumann architecture]]
* [[Cellular architecture]]

Of all these [[abstract machine]]s, a quantum computer holds the most promise for revolutionizing computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=II|first1=Joseph D. Dumas|title=Computer Architecture: Fundamentals and Principles of Computer Design|date=2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780849327490|page=340|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZWaUurOwMPQC&amp;q=quantum+computers&amp;q=quantum%20computers|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Logic gates]] are a common abstraction which can apply to most of the above [[Digital data|digital]] or [[analog signal|analog]] paradigms. The ability to store and execute lists of instructions called [[Computer program|programs]] makes computers extremely versatile, distinguishing them from [[calculator]]s. The [[Church–Turing thesis]] is a mathematical statement of this versatility: any computer with a [[Turing-complete|minimum capability (being Turing-complete)]] is, in principle, capable of performing the same tasks that any other computer can perform. Therefore, any type of computer ([[netbook]], [[supercomputer]], [[cellular automaton]], etc.) is able to perform the same computational tasks, given enough time and storage capacity.

=== Artificial intelligence ===
A computer will solve problems in exactly the way it is programmed to, without regard to efficiency, alternative solutions, possible shortcuts, or possible errors in the code. Computer programs that learn and adapt are part of the emerging field of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]]. Artificial intelligence based products generally fall into two major categories: rule based systems and pattern recognition systems. Rule based systems attempt to represent the rules used by human experts and tend to be expensive to develop. Pattern based systems use data about a problem to generate conclusions. Examples of pattern based systems include voice recognition, font recognition, translation and the emerging field of on-line marketing.

== Professions and organizations ==
As the use of computers has spread throughout society, there are an increasing number of careers involving computers.

The '''Cora''' was a digital [[fire control system]] designed by [[Peter Toth (engineer)|Peter Toth]] and produced by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] company [[Rheinmetall_Air_Defence|Contraves]].

== Development ==
Peter Toth started the design in 1957, and the system was fielded for [[anti-aircraft]] fire direction with the Swiss Army in the 60s.&lt;ref name="24heures"&gt;[http://archives.24heures.ch/actu/hi-tech/ordinateur-historique-retrouve-caves-epfl-2011-11-09 Un ordinateur historique retrouvé dans les caves de l’EPFL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108201533/http://archives.24heures.ch/actu/hi-tech/ordinateur-historique-retrouve-caves-epfl-2011-11-09 |date=2014-11-08 }}, ''24 Heures''&lt;/ref&gt;

One copy of the system was used at the [[EPFL]] for cartography, and was put on display during [[Expo64]]. The unit was rediscovered in storage in 2011, and is now on display at the [[Musée Bolo]], in the Computer Science department of the EPFL.&lt;ref name="24heures" /&gt;

'''Definity''' is a  [[Digital data|digital]] [[film recorder]] for motion picture applications, produced by CCG Digital Image Technology, the successor of [[Agfa|Agfa-Gevaert's]] film recorder division.

Launched at [[NAB Show|NAB]] in Las Vegas in 2004, Definity marked a departure from previous, more analogue technologies of recording digital sequences onto motion picture film as it utilizes a monochrome high-resolution [[LCD]] panel.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Before Definity's launch, LCD technology was commonly regarded as unsuitable for film recording purposes, despite its great potential: Main problems were limitations in [[Color depth|bit depth]], temporary image retention (TIR) and insufficiently saturated colors.

Definity's imaging unit exploits the [[sub-pixel]] structure of the LCD in order to record [[anamorphic]] "[[CinemaScope]]" material without loss of horizontal image information:  When instead of the standard square pixels the device utilizes its native anamorphic pixels (with an aspect of 3:1), flat widescreen material with a typical aspect ratio of 2.36:1 is horizontal compressed on the LCD, thus arriving at a squeezed, 1.18:1 image required on-film without having to jettison vital image information.

Since 2010 CCG launched a new full LED backlight system to increase the contrast and Density range by using 4320 separate RGB LEDs, increasing speed and Contrast ratio.

In the field of [[automotive electronics]], '''Door Control Unit''' (DCU) is a generic term for an [[embedded system]] that controls a number of electrical systems associated with an advanced [[motor vehicle]]. An advanced motor vehicle consists of a number of ECUs (Electrical Control Units), and the Door Control Unit (DCU) is an important one among them.

The Door Control Unit is responsible for controlling and monitoring various electronic accessories in a vehicle's door. Since most of the vehicles have more than one door, generally DCUs are present in each door separately. A DCU associated with the driver's door has some additional functionalities. This additional features are the result of complex functions like locking, driver door switch pad, [[child lock]] switches, etc., which are associated with the driver's door. In most of the cases driver door module acts as a master and others act as slaves in communication protocols.

== Features Controlled by Door Control Unit ==

* Manual window movements
* Automatic window movements
* Global Open-Close functionality
* Child lock safety feature
* Mirror folding
* Mirror adjustment
In some advanced motor vehicles, luxury features like puddle lamps and BLIS (Blind spot Indicator System) are also supported by DCUs.

'''Environmental engineering law''' is a profession that requires an expertise in both [[environmental engineering]] and [[law]]. This field includes professionals with both a legal and environmental engineering education. This dual educational requirement is typically satisfied through an [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology|ABET]] accredited degree in environmental engineering and an [[American Bar Association|ABA]] accredited law degree. Likewise, this profession requires both licensure in professional environmental engineering&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.ncees.org/licensure/licensure_for_engineers/ NCEES Professional Engineer Licensure]&lt;/ref&gt; and admittance to one bar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbex.org/ National Conference of Bar Examiners]&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental engineering law is the professional application of law, [[science]] and [[engineering]] principles to improve the environment (air, water, and/or land resources), to provide healthy water, air, and land for human habitation and for other organisms, and to remediate polluted sites. Environmental engineering lawyers seek to promote the advancement of technical engineering knowledge in the legal profession and to enhance informed legal analysis of complex environmental matters.

==Practice areas==
Environmental engineering law professionals offer a sound knowledge base in the fields of both environmental engineering and law to address complex environmental problems which demand both professional technical practice and legal expertise. Areas of practice are continually expanding, but frequently include complex land transactions, such as: 

*[[Brownfield land|Brownfields]] redevelopment
*[[Asbestos]] [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline survey]] and [[building revaluation]] due to forthcoming [[asbestos abatement]]s
*[[Soil contamination]] assessment &amp; [[Environmental remediation|remediation]], the development of a [[remedial action workplan]] (RAWP) and [[engineering controls]], including an [[environmental land use restriction]] (ELUR)
*[[Total maximum daily load]] (TMDL) [[nutrient loading studies]] (ex. for [[NPDES]] wastewater discharges) and regulatory negotiation of [[nutrients discharge limits]] from [[waste treatment]] plants, such as [[phosphorus]] and [[nitrogen]].

'''Enyo''' is an [[open-source software|open source]] [[JavaScript framework]] for cross-platform mobile, desktop, TV and web applications emphasizing object-oriented encapsulation and modularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.palm.com/content/api/dev-guide/enyo.html |title=Developing Enyo Applications |accessdate=2011-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104145438/https://developer.palm.com/content/api/dev-guide/enyo.html |archivedate=2012-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially developed by [[Palm, Inc.|Palm]], which was later acquired by [[Hewlett-Packard]] and then released under an Apache 2.0 license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/hp-webos-enyo-app-framework-goes-open-source/65117 | title=HP: WebOS, Enyo app framework goes open source | accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sponsored by [[LG Electronics]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]].

== Bootplate ==
''Bootplate'' is a simplified way of creating an app, providing a skeleton of the program's folder [[Tree (data structure)|tree]]. The Bootplate template provides a complete starter project that supports source control and cross-platform deployment out of the box. It can be used to facilitate both the creation of a new project and the preparation for its eventual deployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://github.com/enyojs/enyo/wiki/Bootplate | title=Bootplate Github | accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ferroelectric RAM''' ('''FeRAM''', '''F-RAM''' or '''FRAM''') is a [[random-access memory]] similar in construction to [[dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]] but using a [[ferroelectric]] layer instead of a [[dielectric]] layer to achieve non-volatility. FeRAM is one of a growing number of alternative [[non-volatile random-access memory]] technologies that offer the same functionality as [[flash memory]].

FeRAM's advantages over flash include: lower power usage, faster write performance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inovacaotecnologica.com.br/noticias/noticia.php?artigo=fetram-memoria-nao-volatil&amp;id=010110110929|title=FeTRAM: memória não-volátil consome 99% menos energia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a much greater maximum read/write endurance (about 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fujitsu.com/us/Images/MB85R4001A-DS501-00005-3v0-E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cypress.com/file/136476/download&lt;/ref&gt; cycles). FeRAMs have data retention times of more than 10 years at +85&amp;nbsp;°C (up to many decades at lower temperatures).
Market disadvantages of FeRAM are much lower [[computer storage density|storage densities]] than flash devices, storage capacity limitations and higher cost. FeRAM read process is destructive, necessitating a write-after-read architecture (standard DRAM capacitor cells require write-after-read as well).

==History==
Ferroelectric RAM was proposed by [[MIT]] graduate student [[Dudley Allen Buck]] in his master's thesis, ''Ferroelectrics for Digital Information Storage and Switching,'' published in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley A. Buck, "Ferroelectrics for Digital Information Storage and Switching." Report R-212, [[MIT]], June 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] was experimenting with ferroelectric-crystal memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Computer Memories |author-first=Louis N. |author-last=Ridenour |date=June 1955 |journal=[[Scientific American]] |page=92 |url=http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2006/04/20/computer-memories/ |access-date=2016-08-22 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822160120/http://blog.modernmechanix.com/computer-memories/ |archive-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Development of FeRAM began in the late 1980s. Work was done in 1991 at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on improving methods of read out, including a novel method of non-destructive readout using pulses of UV radiation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/33777/1/94-0506.pdf Optically Addressed Ferroelectric Memory with Non-Destructive Read-Out] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414013337/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/33777/1/94-0506.pdf |date=2009-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the current FeRAM technology was developed by [[Ramtron]], a [[fabless semiconductor company]]. One major licensee is [[Fujitsu]], who operates what is probably the largest semiconductor [[Semiconductor fabrication plant|foundry]] production line with FeRAM capability. Since 1999 they have been using this line to produce standalone FeRAMs, as well as specialized chips (e.g. chips for smart cards) with embedded FeRAMs. Fujitsu produced devices for Ramtron until 2010.  Since 2010 Ramtron's fabricators have been TI (Texas Instruments) and IBM. Since at least 2001 [[Texas Instruments]] has collaborated with Ramtron to develop FeRAM test chips in a modified 130&amp;nbsp;nm process. In the fall of 2005, Ramtron reported that they were evaluating prototype samples of an 8-megabit FeRAM manufactured using Texas Instruments' FeRAM process. Fujitsu and Seiko-Epson were in 2005 collaborating in the development of a 180&amp;nbsp;nm FeRAM process. In 2012 [[Ramtron]] was acquired by [[Cypress Semiconductor]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2012/11/21/cypress-semiconductor-completes.html&lt;/ref&gt;
FeRAM research projects have also been reported at [[Samsung]], [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]], [[Oki Electric Industry|Oki]], [[Toshiba]], [[Infineon]], [[Hynix]], [[Symetrix]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], [[University of Toronto]], and the [[Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre]] (IMEC, [[Belgium]]).

==Description==
[[Image:FeRAM cell configuration 1.svg|thumb|300px|right|Structure of a FeRAM cell]]
[[Image:1T FeRAM cell structure.svg|thumb|300px|right|Structure of a 1 transistor FeRAM cell and its working mechanism]]

Conventional [[DRAM]] consists of a grid of small [[capacitor]]s and their associated wiring and signaling [[transistor]]s. Each storage element, a ''cell'', consists of one capacitor and one transistor, a so-called "1T-1C" device. DRAM cells scale directly with the size of the [[semiconductor fabrication]] process being used to make it. For instance, on the 90&amp;nbsp;nm process used by most memory providers to make DDR2 DRAM, the cell size is 0.22&amp;nbsp;μm², which includes the capacitor, transistor, wiring, and some amount of "blank space" between the various parts — it appears 35% utilization is typical, leaving 65% of the space wasted.

DRAM data is stored as the presence or lack of an electrical charge in the capacitor, with the lack of charge in general representing "0". Writing is accomplished by activating the associated control transistor, draining the cell to write a "0", or sending current into it from a supply line if the new value should be "1". Reading is similar in nature; the transistor is again activated, draining the charge to a ''sense amplifier''. If a pulse of charge is noticed in the amplifier, the cell held a charge and thus reads "1"; the lack of such a pulse indicates a "0". Note that this process is ''destructive'', once the cell has been read.  If it did hold a "1," it must be re-charged to that value again. Since a cell loses its charge after some time due to leak currents, it must be actively refreshed at intervals.

The 1T-1C storage cell design in an FeRAM is similar in construction to the storage cell in widely used [[Dynamic random access memory|DRAM]] in that both cell types include one capacitor and one access transistor. In a DRAM cell capacitor, a linear dielectric is used, whereas in an FeRAM cell capacitor the dielectric structure includes [[ferroelectric material]], typically [[lead zirconate titanate]] (PZT).

A ferroelectric material has a nonlinear relationship between the applied electric field and the apparent stored charge. Specifically, the ferroelectric characteristic has the form of a [[hysteresis]] loop, which is very similar in shape to the hysteresis loop of [[ferromagnetic]] materials. The [[dielectric constant]] of a ferroelectric is typically much higher than that of a linear dielectric because of the effects of semi-permanent [[dipole|electric dipoles]] formed in the [[crystal structure]] of the ferroelectric material. When an external electric field is applied across a dielectric, the dipoles tend to align themselves with the field direction, produced by small shifts in the positions of atoms and shifts in the distributions of electronic charge in the crystal structure. After the charge is removed, the dipoles retain their polarization state. Binary "0"s and "1"s are stored as one of two possible electric polarizations in each data storage cell. For example, in the figure a "1" is encoded using the negative remnant polarization "-Pr", and a "0" is encoded using the positive remnant polarization "+Pr".

In terms of operation, FeRAM is similar to DRAM. Writing is accomplished by applying a field across the ferroelectric layer by charging the plates on either side of it, forcing the atoms inside into the "up" or "down" orientation (depending on the polarity of the charge), thereby storing a "1" or "0". Reading, however, is somewhat different than in DRAM. The transistor forces the cell into a particular state, say "0". If the cell already held a "0", nothing will happen in the output lines. If the cell held a "1", the re-orientation of the atoms in the film will cause a brief pulse of current in the output as they push [[electron]]s out of the metal on the "down" side. The presence of this pulse means the cell held a "1". Since this process overwrites the cell, reading FeRAM is a destructive process, and requires the cell to be re-written if it was changed.

In general, the operation of FeRAM is similar to [[ferrite core memory]], one of the primary forms of computer memory in the 1960s. However, compared to core memory, FeRAM requires far less power to flip the state of the polarity and does so much faster.

==Comparison with other memory types==

===Density===
The main determinant of a memory system's cost is the density of the components used to make it up. Smaller components, and fewer of them, means that more cells can be packed onto a single chip, which in turn means more can be produced at once from a single silicon wafer. This improves yield, which is directly related to cost.

The lower limit to this scaling process is an important point of comparison.  In general, the technology that scales to the smallest cell size will end up being the least expensive per bit. In terms of construction, FeRAM and DRAM are similar, and can in general be built on similar lines at similar sizes. In both cases, the lower limit seems to be defined by the amount of charge needed to trigger the sense amplifiers. For DRAM, this appears to be a problem at around 55&amp;nbsp;nm, at which point the charge stored in the capacitor is too small to be detected. It is not clear as to whether FeRAM can scale to the same size, as the charge density of the PZT layer may not be the same as the metal plates in a normal capacitor.

An additional limitation on size is that materials tend to stop being ferroelectric when they are too small.&lt;ref name=Spanier&gt;[http://www.materials.drexel.edu/mml/pubs/Spanier_Kolpak_etal_NL06.pdf Ferroelectric Phase Transition in Individual Single-Crystalline BaTiO3 Nanowires] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615155151/http://www.materials.drexel.edu/mml/pubs/Spanier_Kolpak_etal_NL06.pdf |date=2010-06-15 }}. See also the associated [http://www.physorg.com/news66555256.html press release].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Junquera and Ghosez, ''Nature'', 2003, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature01501 DOI 10.1038/nature01501]&lt;/ref&gt; (This effect is related to the ferroelectric's "depolarization field".) There is ongoing research on addressing the problem of stabilizing ferroelectric materials; one approach, for example, uses molecular adsorbates.&lt;ref name=Spanier/&gt;

To date, the commercial FeRAM devices have been produced at 350&amp;nbsp;nm and 130&amp;nbsp;nm. Early models required two FeRAM cells per bit, leading to very low densities, but this limitation has since been removed.

===Power consumption===
The key advantage to FeRAM over DRAM is what happens ''between'' the read and write cycles. In DRAM, the charge deposited on the metal plates leaks across the insulating layer and the control transistor, and disappears. In order for a DRAM to store data for anything other than a very short time, every cell must be periodically read and then re-written, a process known as ''refresh''. Each cell must be refreshed many times every second (~65&amp;nbsp;ms&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.micron.com/pdf/technotes/ddr2/TN4716.pdf TN-47-16: Designing for High-Density DDR2 Memory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920032305/http://download.micron.com/pdf/technotes/ddr2/TN4716.pdf |date=2006-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and this requires a continuous supply of power.

In contrast, FeRAM only requires power when actually reading or writing a cell. The vast majority of power used in DRAM is used for refresh, so it seems reasonable to suggest that the benchmark quoted by STT-MRAM researchers is useful here too, indicating power usage about 99% lower than DRAM. The destructive read aspect of FeRAM may put it at a disadvantage compared to [[Magnetoresistive random-access memory|MRAM]], however.

Another non-volatile memory type is [[flash RAM]], and like FeRAM it does not require a refresh process. Flash works by pushing electrons across a high-quality insulating barrier where they get "stuck" on one terminal of a [[transistor]]. This process requires high voltages, which are built up in a [[charge pump]] over time. This means that FeRAM could be expected to be lower power than flash, at least for writing, as the write power in FeRAM is only marginally higher than reading. For a "mostly-read" device the difference might be slight, but for devices with more balanced read and write the difference could be expected to be much higher.

===Performance===
DRAM performance is limited by the rate at which the charge stored in the cells can be drained (for reading) or stored (for writing). In general, this ends up being defined by the capability of the control transistors, the capacitance of the lines carrying power to the cells, and the heat that power generates.

FeRAM is based on the physical movement of atoms in response to an external field, which happens to be extremely fast, settling in about 1&amp;nbsp;ns. In theory, this means that FeRAM could be much faster than DRAM. However, since power has to flow into the cell for reading and writing, the electrical and switching delays would likely be similar to DRAM overall. It does seem reasonable to suggest that FeRAM would require less charge than DRAM, because DRAMs need to ''hold'' the charge, whereas FeRAM would have been written to before the charge would have drained. However, there is a delay in writing because the charge has to flow through the control transistor, which limits current somewhat.

In comparison to flash, the advantages are much more obvious. Whereas the read operation is likely to be similar in performance, the charge pump used for writing requires a considerable time to "build up" current, a process that FeRAM does not need. Flash memories commonly need a millisecond or more to complete a write, whereas current FeRAMs may complete a write in less than 150 ns.

On the other hand, FeRAM has its own reliability issues, including imprint and fatigue. Imprint is the preferential polarization state from previous writes to that state, and fatigue is increase of minimum writing voltage due to loss of polarization after extensive cycling.

The theoretical performance of FeRAM is not entirely clear. Existing 350&amp;nbsp;nm devices have read times on the order of 50–60&amp;nbsp;ns. Although slow compared to modern DRAMs, which can be found with times on the order of 2&amp;nbsp;ns, common 350&amp;nbsp;nm DRAMs operated with a read time of about 35&amp;nbsp;ns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel2/662/5918/00229238.pdf?tp=&amp;arnumber=229238&amp;isnumber=5918|title=A 35 ns 64 Mb DRAM using on-chip boosted power supply|first1=Dong-Jae|last1=Lee|first2=Yong-Sik|last2=Seok|first3=Do-Chan|last3=Choi|first4=Jae-Hyeong|last4=Lee|first5=Young-Rae|last5=Kim|first6=Hyeun-Su|last6=Kim|first7=Dong-Soo|last7=Jun|first8=Oh-Hyun|last8=Kwon|date=1 June 1992|publisher=|pages=64–65|via=IEEE Xplore|doi=10.1109/VLSIC.1992.229238}}&lt;/ref&gt; so FeRAM performance appears to be comparable given the same fabrication technology.

==Overall==
FeRAM remains a relatively small part of the overall semiconductor market. In 2005, worldwide semiconductor sales were US $235 billion (according to the [[Gartner Group]]), with the flash memory market accounting for US $18.6 billion (according to IC Insights).{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} The 2005 annual sales of Ramtron, perhaps the largest FeRAM vendor, were reported to be US $32.7 million.  The much larger sales of flash memory compared to the alternative NVRAMs support a much larger research and development effort. Flash memory is produced using semiconductor linewidths of 30&amp;nbsp;nm at Samsung (2007) while FeRAMs are produced in linewidths of 350&amp;nbsp;nm at Fujitsu and 130&amp;nbsp;nm at Texas Instruments (2007). Flash memory cells can store multiple bits per cell (currently 3 in the highest density NAND flash devices), and the number of bits per flash cell is projected to increase to 4 or even to 8 as a result of innovations in flash cell design. As a consequence, the areal bit densities of flash memory are much higher than those of FeRAM, and thus the cost per bit of flash memory is orders of magnitude lower than that of FeRAM.

The density of FeRAM arrays might be increased by improvements in FeRAM foundry process technology and cell structures, such as the development of vertical capacitor structures (in the same way as DRAM) to reduce the area of the cell footprint. However, reducing the cell size may cause the data signal to become too weak to be detectable. In 2005, Ramtron reported significant sales of its FeRAM products in a variety of sectors including (but not limited to) [[electricity meter]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The other emerging NVRAMs, such as MRAM, may seek to enter similar niche markets in competition with FeRAM.

[[Texas Instruments]] proved it to be possible to embed FeRAM cells using two additional masking steps{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} during conventional CMOS semiconductor manufacture. Flash typically requires nine masks. This makes possible for example, the integration of FeRAM onto microcontrollers, where a simplified process would reduce costs. However, the materials used to make FeRAMs are not commonly used in CMOS integrated circuit manufacturing. Both the PZT ferroelectric layer and the noble metals used for electrodes raise CMOS process compatibility and contamination issues. [[Texas Instruments]] has incorporated an amount of FRAM memory into its [[MSP430]] microcontrollers in its new FRAM series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Green computing''', '''green ICT''' as per International Federation of Global &amp; Green ICT "IFGICT", '''green IT''', or '''ICT sustainability''', is the study and practice of [[environmentally sustainable]] computing or IT.

The goals of green computing are similar to [[green chemistry]]: reduce the use of hazardous materials, maximize [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] during the product's lifetime,  the [[recycling|recyclability]] or [[Biodegradation|biodegradability]] of defunct products and factory waste. Green computing is important for all classes of systems, ranging from handheld systems&lt;ref&gt;S.

[[File:Energy Star logo.svg|thumb|right|Energy Star logo|100px]]
In 1992, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] launched [[Energy Star]], a voluntary labeling program that is designed to promote and recognize the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in monitors, climate control equipment, and other technologies. This resulted in the widespread adoption of [[sleep mode]] among consumer electronics. Concurrently, the Swedish organization TCO Development launched the [[TCO Certification]] program to promote low magnetic and electrical emissions from [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]-based [[computer display]]s; this program was later expanded to include criteria on energy consumption, [[ergonomics]], and the use of hazardous materials in construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TCO takes the initiative in comparative product testing |accessdate=May 3, 2008 |date=May 3, 2008 |url=http://www.boivie.se/index.php?page=2&amp;lang=eng |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070723060821/http://www.boivie.se/index.php?page=2&amp;lang=eng |archive-date=July 23, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations and industry initiatives==
The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) has published a survey of over 90 government and industry initiatives on "Green ICTs", i.e. information and communication technologies, the environment and climate change. The report concludes that initiatives tend to concentrate on the greening ICTs themselves rather than on their actual implementation to tackle global warming and environmental degradation. In general, only 20% of initiatives have measurable targets, with government programs tending to include targets more frequently than business associations.&lt;ref&gt;Full report: {{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/47/12/42825130.pdf|author=OECD Working Party on the Information Economy|title=Towards Green ICT strategies: Assessing Policies and Programmes on ICTs and the Environment|access-date=November 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317103746/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/47/12/42825130.pdf|archive-date=March 17, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}} Summary: {{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/18/43044065.pdf|title=Executive summary of OECD report|author=OECD Working Party on the Information Economy|access-date=November 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317102750/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/18/43044065.pdf|archive-date=March 17, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government===
Many [[governmental]] agencies have continued to implement standards and regulations that encourage green computing. The [[Energy Star]] program was revised in October 2006 to include stricter efficiency requirements for computer equipment, along with a tiered ranking system for approved products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EPA Announces New Computer Efficiency Requirements |date=October 23, 2006 |url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/a8f952395381d3968525701c005e65b5/113b0c0647fee41585257210006474f1!OpenDocument |last=Jones |first=Ernesta |publisher=U.S. EPA |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212022429/http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/a8f952395381d3968525701c005e65b5/113b0c0647fee41585257210006474f1!OpenDocument |archive-date=February 12, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,2097558,00.asp |title=How Important Will New Energy Star Be for PC Makers? |last=Gardiner |first=Bryan |date=February 22, 2007 |publisher=PC Magazine |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826193654/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,2097558,00.asp |archive-date=August 26, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2008, 26 US states established statewide recycling programs for obsolete computers and consumer electronics equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-takeback.org/docs%20open/Toolkit_Legislators/state%20legislation/state_leg_main.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306222713/http://www.e-takeback.org/docs%20open/Toolkit_Legislators/state%20legislation/state_leg_main.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2009 |title= State Legislation on E-Waste |date=March 20, 2008 |publisher=Electronics Take Back Coalition |accessdate=March 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statutes either impose an "advance recovery fee" for each unit sold at retail or require the manufacturers to reclaim the equipment at disposal.

In 2010, the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] (ARRA) was signed into legislation by President Obama. The bill allocated over $90 billion to be invested in green initiatives (renewable energy, smart grids, energy efficiency, etc.) In January 2010, the U.S. Energy Department granted $47 million of the ARRA money towards projects that aim to improve the energy efficiency of data centers. The projects provided research to optimize data center hardware and software, improve power supply chain, and [[computer cooling|data center cooling technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.energy.gov/news2009/8491.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527141406/http://www.energy.gov/news2009/8491.htm |archivedate=May 27, 2010 |title=Secretary Chu Announces $47 Million to Improve Efficiency in Information Technology and Communications Sectors |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |date=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry===
* [[Climate Savers Computing Initiative]] (CSCI) is an effort to reduce the electric power consumption of PCs in active and inactive states.&lt;ref name="CSCI_pressrel_launch"&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/program/press.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214140754/http://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/program/press.html |archivedate=February 14, 2008 |title=Intel and Google Join with Dell, EDS, EPA, HP, IBM, Lenovo, Microsoft, PG&amp;E, World Wildlife Fund and Others to Launch Climate Savers Computing Initiative |publisher=Business Wire |date=June 12, 2007 |accessdate=December 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSCI provides a catalog of green products from its member organizations, and information for reducing PC power consumption. It was started on 2007-06-12. The name stems from the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s Climate Savers program, which was launched in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/program/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215151042/http://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/program/index.html |archivedate=December 15, 2007 |title=What exactly is the Climate Savers Computing Initiative? |publisher=Climate Savers Computing Initiative |year=2007 |accessdate=December 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WWF is also a member of the Computing Initiative.&lt;ref name="CSCI_pressrel_launch" /&gt;
* The [[Green Electronics Council]] offers the [[Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool]] (EPEAT) to assist in the purchase of "greener" computing systems. The Council evaluates computing equipment on 51 criteria - 23 required and 28 optional - that measure a product's efficiency and sustainability attributes. Products are rated Gold, Silver, or Bronze, depending on how many optional criteria they meet. On 2007-01-24, President [[George W. Bush]] issued Executive Order 13423, which requires all United States Federal agencies to use EPEAT when purchasing computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.epeat.net/Docs/Bush%20Requires%20EPEAT%20(1-24-07).pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qCuJd6am?url=http://www.epeat.net/Docs/Bush%20Requires%20EPEAT%20%281-24-07%29.pdf |archivedate=June 3, 2010 |title=President Bush Requires Federal Agencies to Buy EPEAT Registered Green Electronic Products |publisher=Green Electronics Council |date=January 24, 2007 |accessdate=September 20, 2007 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070124-2.html |title=Executive Order: Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management |publisher=The White House: Office of the Press Secretary |date=January 24, 2007 |accessdate=September 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831005045/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070124-2.html |archive-date=August 31, 2011 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Green Grid]] is a global consortium dedicated to advancing energy efficiency in data centers and business computing ecosystems. It was founded in February 2007 by several key companies in the industry&amp;nbsp;– [[AMD]], [[American Power Conversion|APC]], [[Dell]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], [[Rackable Systems]], [[SprayCool]] (purchased in 2010 by [http://www.parker.com/portal/site/Market-Tech/menuitem.e9f921bc8ae21676de92b210237ad1ca/?vgnextoid=e7bfa7bee4a70310VgnVCM10000048021dacRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=default Parker]), [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[VMware]]. The Green Grid has since grown to hundreds of members, including end-users and government organizations, all focused on improving [[data center infrastructure efficiency]] (DCIE).
* The [[Green500]] list rates supercomputers by energy efficiency ([[megaflops]]/[[watt]]), encouraging a focus on efficiency rather than absolute performance.
* [[Green Comm Challenge]] is an organization that promotes the development of energy conservation technology and practices in the field of Information and Communications Technology (ICT).
* The [[Transaction Processing Performance Council]] (TPC) Energy specification augments existing TPC benchmarks by allowing optional publications of energy metrics alongside performance results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Energy benchmarks: a detailed analysis (e-Energy 2006) |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1791314.1791336|publisher=ACM. {{ISBN|978-1-4503-0042-1}}.

==Approaches==
Modern [[Information technology|IT]] systems rely upon a complicated mix of people, networks, and hardware; as such, a green computing initiative must cover all of these areas as well. A solution may also need to address end user satisfaction, management restructuring, regulatory compliance, and return on investment (ROI). There are also considerable fiscal motivations for companies to take control of their own power consumption; "of the power management tools available, one of the most powerful may still be simple, plain, common sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.deloitte.co.uk/TMTPredictions/technology/Green-and-lean-it-data-centre-efficiency.cfm |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100706131340/http://www.deloitte.co.uk/TMTPredictions/technology/Green-and-lean-it-data-centre-efficiency.cfm |archivedate =July 6, 2010 |title=The common sense of lean and green IT |work=Deloitte Technology Predictions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Product longevity===
[[Gartner]] maintains that the PC manufacturing process accounts for 70% of the natural resources used in the life cycle of a PC.&lt;ref&gt;InfoWorld July 6, 2009;
{{cite web |url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/green-it/used-pc-strategy-passes-toxic-buck-300?_kip_ipx=1053322433-1267784052&amp;_pxn=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121223HCFSDBIFBWETHVYUSDVFSDJB CFSDBVGZDGFCHGSDVYUFSDYVGASJDVG315/http://www.infoworld.com/d/green-it/used-pc-strategy-passes-toxic-buck-300?_kip_ipx=1053322433-1267784052&amp;_pxn=0 |archivedate=January 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Fujitsu released a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of a desktop that show that manufacturing and end of life accounts for the majority of this desktop's ecological footprint.&lt;ref&gt;GreenIT.fr Feb. 2011; http://www.greenit.fr/article/materiel/pc-de-bureau/quelle-est-l-empreinte-carbone-d-un-ordinateur-3478 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424020904/http://www.greenit.fr/article/materiel/pc-de-bureau/quelle-est-l-empreinte-carbone-d-un-ordinateur-3478 |date=April 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the biggest contribution to green computing usually is to prolong the equipment's lifetime. Another report from Gartner recommends to "Look for product longevity, including upgradability and modularity."&lt;ref&gt;Simon Mingay, Gartner: 10 Key Elements of a 'Green IT' Strategy;
{{cite web |url=http://www.onsitelasermedic.com/pdf/10_key_elements_greenIT.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730120749/http://www.onsitelasermedic.com/pdf/10_key_elements_greenIT.pdf |archivedate=July 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, manufacturing a new PC makes a far bigger [[ecological footprint]] than manufacturing a new [[RAM]] module to upgrade an existing one.

===Data center design===
Data center facilities are heavy consumers of energy, accounting for between 1.1% and 1.5% of the world’s total energy use in 2010 [1]. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that data center facilities consume up to 100 to 200 times more energy than standard office buildings.&lt;ref name="https://energy.gov"&gt;“Best Practices Guide for Energy-Efficient Data Center Design”, prepared by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy, Federal Energy Management Program, March 2011.[https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/10/f3/eedatacenterbestpractices.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220151305/https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/10/f3/eedatacenterbestpractices.pdf |date=December 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficient data center design should address all of the energy use aspects included in a data center: from the IT equipment to the HVAC(Heating, ventilation and air conditioning) equipment to the actual location, configuration and construction of the building.

The U.S. Department of Energy specifies five primary areas on which to focus energy efficient data center design best practices:&lt;ref&gt;Koomey, Jonathon. “Growth in data center electricity use 2005 to 2010,” Oakland, CA: Analytics Press. August 1. {{cite web |url=http://www.analyticspress.com/datacenters.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111082558/http://www.analyticspress.com/datacenters.html |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Information technology (IT) systems
* Environmental conditions
* Air management
* Cooling systems
* Electrical systems

Additional energy efficient design opportunities specified by the U.S. Department of Energy include on-site electrical generation and recycling of waste heat.&lt;ref&gt;Junaid Shuja, Abdullah Gani, Shahaboddin Shamshirband, Raja Wasim Ahmad, Kashif Bilal, Sustainable Cloud Data Centers: A survey of enabling techniques and technologies, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, Volume 62, September 2016, Pages 195-214, ISSN 1364-0321, https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2016.04.034&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficient data center design should help to better utilize a data center’s space, and increase performance and efficiency.

In 2018, three new US Patents make use of facilities design to simultaneously cool and produce electrical power by use of internal and external waste heat. The three patents use silo design for stimulating use internal waste heat, while the recirculation of the air cooling the silo's computing racks. US Patent  [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=4&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=matteo&amp;s2=gravina&amp;OS=matteo+AND+gravina&amp;RS=matteo+AND+gravina 9,510,486], uses the recirculating air for power generation, while sister patent, US Patent [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=2&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=matteo&amp;s2=gravina&amp;OS=matteo+AND+gravina&amp;RS=matteo+AND+gravina 9,907,213], forces the recirculation of the same air, and sister patent, US Patent [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=matteo&amp;s2=gravina&amp;OS=matteo+AND+gravina&amp;RS=matteo+AND+gravina 10,020,436], uses thermal differences in temperature resulting in negative power usage effectiveness.  Negative power usage effectiveness, makes use of extreme differences between temperatures at times running the computing facilities, that they would run only from external sources other than the power use for computing. 

===Software and deployment optimization===

====Algorithmic efficiency====
{{Main article|Algorithmic efficiency}}
{{Further|Analysis of algorithms}}
The efficiency of algorithms affects the amount of computer resources required for any given computing function and there are many efficiency trade-offs in writing programs.  Algorithm changes, such as switching from a slow (e.g. linear) search algorithm to a fast (e.g. hashed or indexed) search algorithm can reduce resource usage for a given task from substantial to close to zero. &lt;!-- algorithmic efficiency personal example: I re-coded a SQL report query (that was run several times a day) that took 30 minutes to run in 15 seconds.  Impressive?  Sure!  Unusual?  Hardly.  I'm sure there are citeable examples.--&gt; In 2009, a study by a physicist at [[Harvard]] estimated that the average Google search released 7&amp;nbsp;grams of carbon dioxide (CO₂).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,479127,00.html | title=Research reveals environmental impact of Google searches. | accessdate=January 15, 2009 | work=Fox News | date=January 12, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112195017/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,479127,00.html | archive-date=January 12, 2009 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Google disputed this figure, arguing instead that a typical search produced only 0.2&amp;nbsp;grams of CO₂.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/powering-google-search.html | title=Powering a Google search | accessdate=October 1, 2009 | work=Official Google Blog | publisher=Google | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729054622/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/powering-google-search.html | archive-date=July 29, 2009 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resource allocation====
{{Main article|Resource allocation}}
Algorithms can also be used to route data to data centers where electricity is less expensive. Researchers from MIT, Carnegie Mellon University, and Akamai have tested an energy allocation algorithm that successfully routes traffic to the location with the cheapest energy costs. The researchers project up to a 40 percent savings on energy costs if their proposed algorithm were to be deployed. However, this approach does not actually reduce the amount of energy being used; it reduces only the cost to the company using it. Nonetheless, a similar strategy could be used to direct traffic to rely on energy that is produced in a more environmentally friendly or efficient way. A similar approach has also been used to cut energy usage by routing traffic away from data centers experiencing warm weather; this allows computers to be shut down to avoid using air conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Rear don |first= Marguerite |title= Energy-aware Internet routing coming soon |url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10312408-54.html |date= August 18, 2009 |accessdate= August 19, 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110617075237/http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10312408-54.html |archive-date= June 17, 2011 |dead-url= no |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larger server centers are sometimes located where energy and land are inexpensive and readily available. Local availability of renewable energy, climate that allows outside air to be used for cooling, or locating them where the heat they produce may be used for other purposes could be factors in green siting decisions.

Approaches to actually reduce the energy consumption of network devices by proper network/device management techniques are surveyed in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |author1=Aruna Prem Bianzino |author2=Claude Chaudet |author3=Dario Rossi |author4=Jean-Louis Rougier|title=A Survey of Green Networking Research |arxiv= 1010.3880 |class=cs.NI|date= October 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors grouped the approaches into 4 main strategies, namely (i) Adaptive Link Rate (ALR), (ii) Interface Proxying, (iii) Energy Aware Infrastructure, and (iv) Max Energy Aware Applications.

====Virtualizing====
{{Main article|Platform virtualization}}
{{See also|Comparison of platform virtualization software}}
Computer virtualization refers to the abstraction of computer resources, such as the process of running two or more logical computer systems on one set of physical hardware. The concept originated with the IBM [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] operating systems of the 1960s, but was commercialized for [[x86 architecture|x86]]-compatible computers only in the 1990s. With virtualization, a system administrator could combine several physical systems into virtual machines on one single, powerful system, thereby unplugging the original hardware and reducing power and cooling consumption. Virtualization can assist in distributing work so that servers are either busy or put in a low-power sleep state. Several commercial companies and open-source projects now offer software packages to enable a transition to virtual computing. [[Intel Corporation]] and [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] have also built proprietary [[x86 virtualization#Hardware support|virtualization enhancements]] to the x86 [[instruction set]] into each of their CPU product lines, in order to facilitate virtual computing.

New virtual technologies, such as [[Linux Containers]] can also be used to reduce energy consumption. These technologies make a ore efficient use of resources, thus reducing energy consumption by design. Also, the consolidation of virtualized technologies is more efficient than the one done in [[Virtual machine|virtual machines]], so more services can be deployed in the same physical machine, reducing the amount of hardware needed. &lt;ref&gt;Ismael Cuadrado-Cordero, Anne-Cécile Orgerie, Jean-Marc Menaud., [https://hal-centralesupelec.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01578325v2 “Comparative Experimental Analysis of the Quality-of-Service and Energy-Efficiency of VMs and Containers' Consolidation for Cloud Applications,”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628233816/https://hal-centralesupelec.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01578325v2 |date=June 28, 2018 }} International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM 2017), Sep 2017, Split, Croatia. pp.1-6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

====Terminal servers====
{{Main article|Terminal server}}
Terminal servers have also been used in green computing. When using the system, users at a terminal connect to a central server; all of the actual computing is done on the server, but the end user experiences the operating system on the terminal. These can be combined with [[thin client]]s, which use up to 1/8 the amount of energy of a normal workstation, resulting in a decrease of energy costs and consumption.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} There has been an increase in using terminal services with thin clients to create virtual labs. Examples of terminal server software include [[Terminal Services]] for Windows and the [[Linux Terminal Server Project]] (LTSP) for the [[Linux operating system]]. Software-based remote desktop clients such as [[Windows Remote Desktop]] and [[RealVNC]] can provide similar thin-client functions when run on low power, commodity hardware that connects to a server.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hci.stanford.edu/cstr/reports/2011-02.pdf|title=Software or Hardware: The Future of Green Enterprise Computing|last=Kazandjieva|first=Maria|date=|work=|access-date=|last2=Heller|first2=Brandon|last3=Gnawali|first3=Omprakash|last4=Hofer|first4=Wanja|last5=Levis|first5=Philip|last6=Kozyrakis|first6=Christos|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619190042/http://hci.stanford.edu/cstr/reports/2011-02.pdf|archive-date=June 19, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power management===
{{Main article|Power management}}
The [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface]] (ACPI), an open industry standard, allows an operating system to directly control the power-saving aspects of its underlying hardware. This allows a system to automatically turn off components such as [[computer display|monitors]] and [[hard drive]]s after set periods of inactivity. In addition, a system may [[Hibernation (computing)|hibernate]], when most components (including the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and the system RAM) are turned off. ACPI is a successor to an earlier Intel-Microsoft standard called [[Advanced Power Management]], which allows a computer's [[BIOS]] to control power management functions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Some programs allow the user to manually adjust the voltages supplied to the CPU, which reduces both the amount of heat produced and electricity consumed. This process is called [[undervolting]]. Some CPUs can automatically undervolt the processor, depending on the workload; this technology is called "[[SpeedStep]]" on Intel processors, "[[PowerNow!]]"/"[[Cool'n'Quiet]]" on AMD chips, [[LongHaul]] on [[VIA Technologies|VIA]] CPUs, and [[LongRun]] with [[Transmeta]] processors.

====Data center power====
Data centers, which have been criticized for their extraordinarily high energy demand, are a primary focus for proponents of green computing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceGCS9"&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/6982393/Power_Management_Techniques_for_Data_Centers_A_Survey Power Management Techniques for Data Centers: A Survey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114005435/http://www.academia.edu/6982393/Power_Management_Techniques_for_Data_Centers_A_Survey |date=November 14, 2017 }}", 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kurp, Patrick."Green Computing," ''Communications of the ACM''51(10):11.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a [[Greenpeace]] study, data centers represent 21% of the electricity consumed by the IT sector, which is about 382 billion kWh a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://storage.googleapis.com/p4-production-content/international/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/35f0ac1a-clickclean2016-hires.pdf|title=CLICKING CLEAN: WHO IS WINNING  THE RACE TO BUILD  A GREEN INTERNET|last=Greenpeace|first=|date=2017|work=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706161712/https://storage.googleapis.com/p4-production-content/international/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/35f0ac1a-clickclean2016-hires.pdf|archive-date=July 6, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data centers can potentially improve their energy and space efficiency through techniques such as storage consolidation and virtualization. Many organizations are aiming to eliminate underutilized servers, which results in lower energy usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/green-it-over.aspx|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110211120149/http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/green-it-over.aspx|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 11 February 2011|title= Is Green IT Over?|publisher=Dell.com | accessdate=21 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step toward this aim will be training of data center administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sdiwc.net/digital-library/towards-green-computing-application-for-measuring-the-sustainability-of-data-centers-an-analytical-survey.html|title= Towards Green Computing Application for Measuring the Sustainability of Data Centers: An Analytical Survey, Zohreh Gandomi, Salmiah Amin|publisher= SDIWC Digital Library|access-date= November 1, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150402210100/http://sdiwc.net/digital-library/towards-green-computing-application-for-measuring-the-sustainability-of-data-centers-an-analytical-survey.html|archive-date= April 2, 2015|dead-url= no|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. federal government has set a minimum 10% reduction target for data center energy usage by 2011.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; With the aid of a self-styled ultraefficient evaporative cooling technology, Google Inc. has been able to reduce its energy consumption to 50% of that of the industry average.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

====Operating system support====
&lt;!-- Needs Mac and Linux coverage. Also, this may be too detailed for a summary--&gt;
Microsoft Windows, has included limited [[PC power management]] features since Windows 95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms810046.aspx |title=Windows 95 Power Management |access-date=April 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311193319/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms810046.aspx |archive-date=March 11, 2010 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These initially provided for stand-by (suspend-to-RAM) and a monitor low power state. Further iterations of Windows added hibernate (suspend-to-disk) and support for the [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] standard. Windows 2000 was the first NT-based operating system to include power management. This required major changes to the underlying operating system architecture and a new hardware driver model. Windows 2000 also introduced [[Group Policy]], a technology that allowed administrators to centrally configure most Windows features. However, power management was not one of those features. This is probably because the power management settings design relied upon a connected set of per-user and per-machine binary registry values,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/csd/greenit/powerdown |title=Windows power-saving options are, bizarrely, stored in HKEY_CURRENT_USER |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127034201/http://www.liv.ac.uk/csd/greenit/powerdown/ |archivedate=November 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively leaving it up to each user to configure their own power management settings.

This approach, which is not compatible with Windows Group Policy, was repeated in Windows XP. The reasons for this design decision by Microsoft are not known, and it has resulted in heavy criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/11/how_windows_xp.php |title=How Windows XP Wasted $25 Billion of Energy |date=November 21, 2006 |accessdate=November 21, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127051214/http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/11/how_windows_xp.php |archive-date=November 27, 2006 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this section, while quite possibly true, sounded like OR so I cut it out. In fact, the treehugger source is basically a blog... can we do better? Any mainstream media coverage of criticism for this decision? --&gt; Microsoft significantly improved this in Windows Vista&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/b/9/5b97017b-e28a-4bae-ba48-174cf47d23cd/CPA075_WH06.ppt |title=Windows Vista Power Management Changes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110818/http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/b/9/5b97017b-e28a-4bae-ba48-174cf47d23cd/CPA075_WH06.ppt |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by redesigning the power management system to allow basic configuration by Group Policy. The support offered is limited to a single per-computer policy. The most recent release, Windows 7 retains these limitations but does include refinements for [[timer coalescing]], [[processor power management]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/pnppwr/powermgmt/ProcPowerMgmtWin7.mspx |title=Windows 7 Processor Power Management |access-date=April 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510015949/http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/pnppwr/powermgmt/procpowermgmtwin7.mspx |archive-date=May 10, 2010 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/pnppwr/powermgmt/TimerCoal.mspx |title=Windows 7 Timer Coalescing |access-date=April 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416215821/http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/pnppwr/powermgmt/TimerCoal.mspx |archive-date=April 16, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and display panel brightness. The most significant change in Windows 7 is in the user experience. The prominence of the default High Performance power plan has been reduced with the aim of encouraging users to save power.

There is a significant market in third-party [[PC power management]] software offering features beyond those present in the Windows operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/buyers-guide/Power-Management-Software-for-Windows-Workstations-Buyers-Guide|title=Power Management Software for Windows Workstations|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426175620/http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/buyers-guide/Power-Management-Software-for-Windows-Workstations-Buyers-Guide|archivedate=April 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_comm_packages|title=Energy Star Commercial Packages List|access-date=October 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102002142/https://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_comm_packages|archive-date=November 2, 2008|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmcsustainability.org.uk/energy.html|author1=The Headmasters'|author2=Headmistresses' Conference|title=HMC: A Practical Guide to Sustainable Building for Schools|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315230900/http://www.hmcsustainability.org.uk/energy.html|archivedate=March 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; available.

Desktop [[computer power supply|computer power supplies]]  are in general 70–75% efficient,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/2005/02/28/strong_showing/page38.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121216144500/http://www.tomshardware.com/2005/02/28/strong_showing/page38.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 16, 2012 |title=Strong Showing: High-Performance Power Supply Units |last=Schuhmann |first=Daniel |date=February 28, 2005 |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |publisher=Tom's Hardware }}&lt;/ref&gt; dissipating the remaining energy as heat. A certification program called [[80 Plus]] certifies PSUs that are at least 80% efficient; typically these models are drop-in replacements for older, less efficient PSUs of the same form factor. As of July 20, 2007, all new Energy Star 4.0-certified desktop PSUs must be at least 80% efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=computers.pr_crit_computers |title=Computer Key Product Criteria |publisher=Energy Star |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |date=July 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928074314/http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=computers.pr_crit_computers |archive-date=September 28, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Storage====
Smaller form factor (e.g., 2.5&amp;nbsp;inch) [[hard disk drives]] often consume less power per gigabyte than physically larger drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IS the Silent PC Future 2.5-inches wide?|url=http://www.silentpcreview.com/article145-page1.html|accessdate=August 2, 2008|author=Mike Chin|date=March 8, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720000101/http://www.silentpcreview.com/article145-page1.html|archive-date=July 20, 2008|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silentpcreview.com/article29-page2.html|title=Recommended Hard Drives|accessdate=August 2, 2008|author=Mike Chin|date=September 18, 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905085853/http://www.silentpcreview.com/article29-page2.html|archive-date=September 5, 2008|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike hard disk drives, [[solid-state drive]]s store data in flash memory or [[DRAM]].

This claim is stating that a 4GB i-RAM consumes more power than a laptop drive. That may be true, but this section is about SSDs --&gt;

In a recent case study, [[Fusion-io]], manufacturer of solid state storage devices, managed to reduce the energy use and operating costs of [[MySpace]] data centers by 80% while increasing performance speeds beyond that which had been attainable via multiple hard disk drives in Raid 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Media Galleries Temporarily Disabled |url=http://community.fusionio.com/media/p/458/download.aspx |title=Media Galleries Temporarily Disabled - Fusion-io Community Forum |publisher=Community.fusionio.com |date= |accessdate=September 25, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, MySpace was able to retire several of their servers.

As hard drive prices have fallen, storage farms have tended to increase in capacity to make more data available online. This includes archival and backup data that would formerly have been saved on tape or other offline storage. The increase in online storage has increased power consumption. Reducing the power consumed by large storage arrays, while still providing the benefits of online storage, is a subject of ongoing research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/news/1255635/IBM-chief-engineer-talks-green-storage IBM chief engineer talks green storage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502041656/http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/news/1255635/IBM-chief-engineer-talks-green-storage |date=May 2, 2013 }}, SearchStorage - TechTarget&lt;/ref&gt;

====Video card====
A fast [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] may be the largest power consumer in a computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/power-noise.html |title=Faster, Quieter, Lower: Power Consumption and Noise Level of Contemporary Graphics Cards |publisher=X-bit labs |date=July 30, 2006 |accessdate=September 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904054636/http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/power-noise.html |archivedate=September 4, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy-efficient [[video card|display]] options include:
* No video card - use a shared terminal, shared [[thin client]], or [[desktop sharing]] software if display required.
* Use motherboard video output - typically low 3D performance and low power.
* Select a GPU based on low idle power, average wattage, or [[performance per watt]].

====Display====
Unlike other display technologies, [[electronic paper]] does not use any power while displaying an image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Heikenfeld | title = A critical review of the present and future prospects for electronic paper | journal = J. Soc. Inf.

They also contain significant amounts of lead. [[LCD monitor]]s typically use a [[Cold cathode|cold-cathode fluorescent bulb]] to provide light for the display. Some newer displays use an array of [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) in place of the fluorescent bulb, which reduces the amount of electricity used by the display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.thomasnet.com/fullstory/464080 |title=Cree LED Backlight Solution Lowers Power Consumption of LCD Displays |date=May 23, 2005 |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207075733/http://news.thomasnet.com/fullstory/464080 |archive-date=February 7, 2009 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fluorescent back-lights also contain mercury, whereas LED back-lights do not.

===Materials recycling===
{{Main article|Electronic waste | computer recycling | Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive}}

Recycling computing equipment can keep harmful materials such as lead, mercury, and hexavalent chromium out of [[landfill]]s, and can also replace equipment that otherwise would need to be manufactured, saving further energy and emissions. Computer systems that have outlived their particular function can be re-purposed, or donated to various charities and non-profit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth911.org/blog/2007/04/12/reuse-your-electronics-through-donation-to-schools-charities-and-nonprofit-organizations/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503011722/http://earth911.org/blog/2007/04/12/reuse-your-electronics-through-donation-to-schools-charities-and-nonprofit-organizations/ |archivedate=May 3, 2008 |title=Reuse your electronics through donation » Earth 911 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=April 13, 2010 |accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many charities have recently imposed minimum system requirements for donated equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=PC Magazine |volume=26 |issue=17 |date=September 4, 2007 |title=15 Ways to Reinvent Your PC |last=Delaney |first=John |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2170255,00.asp |access-date=August 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502215811/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2170255,00.asp |archive-date=May 2, 2008 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, parts from outdated systems may be salvaged and recycled through certain retail outlets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investor.staples.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=96244&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1004542&amp;highlight= |title=Staples Launches Nationwide Computer and Office Technology Recycling Program |date=May 21, 2007 |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |publisher=Staples, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earth911.org/blog/2007/08/15/goodwill-teams-with-electronic-recyclers-to-recycle-ewaste/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725070137/http://earth911.org/blog/2007/08/15/goodwill-teams-with-electronic-recyclers-to-recycle-ewaste/ |archivedate=July 25, 2008 |title=Goodwill Teams with Electronic Recyclers to Recycle eWaste |date=August 15, 2007 |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |publisher=Earth 911}}&lt;/ref&gt; and municipal or private recycling centers. Computing supplies, such as [[Ink cartridges|printer cartridges]], [[paper recycling|paper]], and [[battery recycling|batteries]] may be recycled as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ink cartridges#Refilled and 3rd party ink cartridges|Refilled ink cartridges]], [[paper recycling]], [[battery recycling]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A drawback to many of these schemes is that computers gathered through recycling drives are often shipped to [[developing countries]] where environmental standards are less strict than in North America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Green Tech: Reduce, Reuse, That's It |last=Segan |first=Sascha |journal=PC Magazine |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2704,2183977,00.asp |volume=26 |issue=19 |page=56 |date=October 2, 2007 |accessdate=November 7, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025050427/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2704,2183977,00.asp |archive-date=October 25, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition]] estimates that 80% of the post-consumer e-waste collected for recycling is shipped abroad to countries such as [[China]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Garbage Land: On the Secret Trail of Trash |last=Royte |first=Elizabeth |pages=169–170 |year=2006 |publisher=Back Bay Books |isbn=0-316-73826-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the collection rate of e-waste is still very low, even in the most ecology-responsible countries like France. In this country, e-waste collection is still at a 14% annual rate between electronic equipment sold and e-waste collected for 2006 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenit.fr/article/materiel/recyclage/deee-l-europe-revoit-ses-objectifs-a-la-hausse-3482 |title=e-waste take-back still very low |date=February 9, 2011 |accessdate=February 9, 2011 |publisher=GreenIT.fr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213031911/http://www.greenit.fr/article/materiel/recyclage/deee-l-europe-revoit-ses-objectifs-a-la-hausse-3482 |archive-date=February 13, 2011 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recycling of old computers raises an important privacy issue. The old storage devices still hold private information, such as emails, passwords, and credit card numbers, which can be recovered simply by someone's using software available freely on the Internet. Deletion of a file does not actually remove the file from the hard drive. Before recycling a computer, users should remove the hard drive, or hard drives if there is more than one, and physically destroy it or store it somewhere safe. There are some authorized hardware recycling companies to whom the computer may be given for recycling, and they typically sign a non-disclosure agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mysecurecyberspace.com/articles/features/green-computing-and-privacy-issues.html |title=Green Computing and Privacy Issues |publisher=MySecureCyberspace |date= |accessdate=September 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028214220/http://www.mysecurecyberspace.com/articles/features/green-computing-and-privacy-issues.html |archive-date=October 28, 2012 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloud computing===
{{Main article| Cloud computing }}
Cloud computing addresses two major ICT challenges related to Green computing – energy usage and [[resource consumption]]. [[Virtualization]], [[Dynamic provisioning environment]], multi-tenancy, green data center approaches are enabling cloud computing to lower carbon emissions and energy usage up to a great extent. Large enterprises and small businesses can reduce their direct energy consumption and carbon emissions by up to 30% and 90% respectively by moving certain on-premises applications into the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-backed-research-suggests-big-energy-reductions-from-cloud/ |title= Microsoft-backed research suggests big energy reductions from cloud |publisher= ZDNet |date= November 4, 2010 |accessdate= September 3, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151208073045/http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-backed-research-suggests-big-energy-reductions-from-cloud/ |archive-date= December 8, 2015 |dead-url= no |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One common example includes [[Online shopping]] that helps people purchase products and services over the Internet without requiring them to drive and waste fuel to reach out to the physical shop, which, in turn, reduces greenhouse gas emission related to travel.&lt;ref name="Google Scholar Citations"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com.pk/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=tWRIBtoAAAAJ&amp;sortby=pubdate&amp;citation_for_view=tWRIBtoAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC|title=Google Scholar Citations|website=scholar.google.com.pk|access-date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edge Computing===
{{Main article| Edge computing }}
New technologies such as [[Edge computing| Edge]] and [[Fog computing]] are a solution to reducing energy consumption. These technologies allow redistributing computation near the use, thus reducing energy costs in the network.&lt;ref&gt;Cuadrado-Cordero, Ismael, [http://www.theses.fr/2017REN1S003 “Microclouds: an approach for a network-aware energy-efficient decentralised cloud,”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628233846/http://www.theses.fr/2017REN1S003 |date=June 28, 2018 }} PhD thesis, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, having smaller data centers, the energy used in operations such as refrigerating and maintenance gets largely reduced. 

===Telecommuting===
{{Main article|Telecommuting}}
[[Teleconference|Teleconferencing]] and [[telepresence]] technologies are often implemented in green computing initiatives. The advantages are many; increased worker satisfaction, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions related to travel, and increased profit margins as a result of lower overhead costs for office space, heat, lighting, etc.&lt;ref&gt;E. Curry, B. Guyon, C. Sheridan, and B. Donnellan, [http://www.edwardcurry.org/publications/MISQE_SustainableIT_Intel_2012.pdf “Developing an Sustainable IT Capability: Lessons From Intel’s Journey,”] MIS Quarterly Executive, vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 61–74, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The savings are significant; the average annual energy consumption for U.S. office buildings is over 23 kilowatt hours per square foot, with heat, air conditioning and lighting accounting for 70% of all energy consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/documents/sector-meeting/4bi_officebuilding.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306130237/http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/documents/sector-meeting/4bi_officebuilding.pdf |archivedate=March 6, 2009 |format=PDF|title=EPA Office Building Energy Use Profile |date=August 15, 2007 |accessdate=March 17, 2008 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other related initiatives, such as [[Hoteling]], reduce the square footage per employee as workers reserve space only when they need it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energypriorities.com/entries/2007/06/what_is_green_it_data_centers.php|title=What Is Green IT?|access-date=March 17, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415091508/http://energypriorities.com/entries/2007/06/what_is_green_it_data_centers.php|archive-date=April 15, 2008|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many types of jobs, such as sales, consulting, and field service, integrate well with this technique.

[[Voice over Internet Protocol|Voice over IP (VoIP)]] reduces the telephony wiring infrastructure by sharing the existing Ethernet copper. VoIP and phone extension mobility also made [[hot desking]] more practical.

===Telecommunication network devices energy indices===
The information and communication technologies (ICTs) energy consumption, in the USA and worldwide, has been estimated respectively at 9.4% and 5.3% of the total electricity produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/cyb/app/docs/itu-icts-for-e-environment.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507123122/http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/cyb/app/docs/itu-icts-for-e-environment.pdf |archive-date=May 7, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy consumption of ICTs is today significant even when compared with other industries. Some study tried to identify the key energy indices that allow a relevant comparison between different devices (network elements).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Virgilio |last1=Puglia |title=Energy indices for environmental sustainability |journal=International Journal of Technology Marketing |date=January 2013 |volume=8 |issue=1/2013 |url=http://inderscience.metapress.com/content/n2w5530544110065/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530121855/http://inderscience.metapress.com/content/n2w5530544110065/ |archivedate=May 30, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis was focused on how to optimise device and network consumption for carrier telecommunication by itself. The target was to  allow an immediate perception of the relationship between the network technology and the environmental effect. These studies are at the start and the gap to fill in this sector is still huge and further research will be necessary.

===Supercomputers===

The inaugural [[Green500]] list was announced on November 15, 2007 at SC|07. As a complement to the TOP500, the unveiling of the Green500 ushered in a new era where supercomputers can be compared by performance-per-watt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.green500.org/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826075608/http://www.green500.org/ |archive-date=August 26, 2016 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tsubame (supercomputer)|TSUBAME-KFC-GSIC Center]] by Tokyo Institute of Technology, Made in Japan was with a great advantage to the second, the Top 1 Supercomputer in the World with 4,503.17 MFLOPS/W and 27.78 Total Power (kW)++

Today a new supercomputer, [[L-CSC]] from the [[GSI Helmholtz Center]], Made in Germany emerged as the most energy-efficient (or greenest) supercomputer in the world. The L-CSC cluster was the first and only supercomputer on the list to surpass 5 gigaflops/watt (billions of operations per second per watt). L-CSC is a heterogeneous supercomputer that is powered by Dual Intel Xeon E5-260 and GPU accelerators, namely AMD FirePro™ S9150 GPUs. It marks the first time that a supercomputer using AMD GPUs has held the top spot. Each server has a memory of 256 gigabytes. Connected, the server via an Infiniband FDR network.

==Education and certification==

Food served '''in a basket''', a '''basket platter''' or a '''basket with fries''' is a [[sandwich]] or other main-dish that is served on top of a [[basket]] of an accompanying foodstuff, usually [[french fries]].  The "basket" is usually either made of plastic and lined with paper, or is simply a disposable [[paperboard]] box or tray.  Sometimes the basket contains other [[side dish]]es as well, such as a container of [[coleslaw]] or a [[Pickled cucumber|pickle]]. This term is common in the [[Cuisine of the Midwest|Midwestern U.S.]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]] chicken in a basket, fried chicken on a bed of [[French Fries|chips]], was a popular dish in pubs and modest restaurants from the late 1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Castelow|first1=Ellen|title=Food in Britain in the 1950s and 1960s|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/CultureUK/Food-in-Britain-in-the-1950s-1960s/|website=Historic UK|publisher=Historic UK Ltd|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicken In A Basket is back on the menu|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Chicken-Basket-menu/story-12793848-detail/story.html|website=Bristol Post|publisher=Local World Limited|accessdate=9 May 2015}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1970s the dish became so ubiquitous in UK venues offering evening entertainment that the locations became known to musicians and entertainers as the "chicken-in-a-basket circuit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brewster|first1=Bill|title=Working Man’s Soul|url=http://www.djhistory.com/features/working-man-s-soul|website=DJhistory|publisher=DJ History Ltd|accessdate=9 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304062927/http://www.djhistory.com/features/working-man-s-soul|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kinsley|first1=Billy|title=The Merseys|url=http://www.triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/a-z/merseys3.shtml|website=Triumph PC Group|publisher=Triumph PC Group|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Golden Garter night club|url=http://www.wythenshawe.btck.co.uk/GoldenGarterNightclub|website=Wythenshawe's History and Heritage|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''intelligence engine''' is a type of [[enterprise information management]] that combines [[Business rule management system|business rule management]], [[predictive analytics|predictive]], and [[prescriptive analytics]] to form a unified information-access platform that provides real-time intelligence through [[Web search engine|search technologies]], [[Dashboard (management information systems)|dashboards]] and/or existing business infrastructure.  Intelligence Engines are process and/or business problem specific, resulting in industry and/or function-specific marketing trademarks associated with them.  They can be differentiated from [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) software in that intelligence engines include organization-level business rules and proactive [[decision management]] functionality.

==History==
The first intelligence engine application appears to have been introduced in 2001 by [[Sonus Networks|Sonus Networks, Inc.]] in their patent US6961334 B1.&lt;ref name="sonus"&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 6961334 | status = patent | title = Intelligence engine | gdate = 2005-11-01 | invent1 = Kaczmarczyk, Casimer M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied to the field of telecommunications systems, the intelligence engine was composed of a database queried by a data distributor layer, received by a telephony management layer and acted upon by a facility management command &amp; control layer.&lt;ref name="sonus" /&gt; This combined standalone business intelligence tools like a [[data warehouse]], reporting and querying software and a [[decision support system]].

The concept was reinforced in 2002 in patent application US20030236689 A1&lt;ref name="2002patent"&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 20030236689 | status = application | title = Analyzing decision points in business processes | pubdate = 2003-12-25 | invent1 = Casati, Fabio | invent2 = Sayal, Mehmet | invent3 = Guadalupe Castellanos, Maria | invent4 = Gunopulos, Dimitrios | url = https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=US&amp;NR=2003236689&amp;KC=A1&amp;FT=E&amp;locale=en_EP}}&lt;/ref&gt; which applied predictive quantitative models to data and used rules to correlate context data at different stages of the business process with business process outcomes to be presented to end users.&lt;ref name="2002patent" /&gt;

[[LogRhythm|LogRhythm Inc.]] advanced the concept in 2010 by adding event managers to the end of the intelligence engine's process to determine reporting, remediation and other outcomes.&lt;ref name="LogRhythm"&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 2012131185 | status = application | title = Advanced Intelligence Engine | pubdate = 2012-05-24 | invent1 = Petersen , Chris | invent2 = Villella, Phillip | invent3 = Aisa, Brad | url = https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=US&amp;NR=2012131185A1&amp;KC=A1&amp;FT=D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, professional service company [[KPMG]] continued to advance the concept by commercializing intelligence engines with the introduction of Third Party Intelligence, which is differentiated from past intelligence engines in its increased use of embedded intellectual property, diversity of global data inputs and focus on predictive analytics to mitigate risk and yield cost savings.&lt;ref name="CIOReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cioreview.com/news/kmpg-launches-third-party-intelligence-intelligence-engine-to-anticipate-thirdparty-disruptions-nid-14407-cid-78.html |title=KMPG Launches Third Party Intelligence: Intelligence Engine to Anticipate Third-party Disruptions|accessdate=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traits==
As a system that combines human intelligence, data inputs, automated decision-making and unified information access, intelligence engines are an advancement in business intelligence tools because they:

'''Israeli ceramics''' are ceramics designed either in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] or [[Israel]] from the beginning of the 20th century. In additional to traditional [[pottery]], in Israel there are artists whose works were created in an industrial environment. Until the late 1970s there existed in Israel a local tradition that emphasized the local values of nature as an expression of [[Zionist]] identity. From the 1980s artistic expressions that sought to undercut this tradition began to appear in the works of Israeli artists, who combined ceramics with other artistic media and with personal, critical agendas.

==Beginning of ceramics in the Land of Israel, 1900–1930==
[[File:(Women) making clay jars, Ramallah, Palestine.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Arab women making clay jars, [[Ramallah]]]]

===Palestinian ceramics===
At the beginning of the 20th century the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] tradition of designing pottery from local materials dominated in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ''The Beginnings of Israeli Ceramics, 1932-1962'', Ceramic Artists Association of Israel. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The pottery was primary functional, intended primarily for the use of the local population in the Land of Israel. Other vessels were imported from neighboring areas.

Pots were thrown on potter's wheels mostly in urban areas or in pottery villages. It was a craft traditionally worked by men.  In the census carried out on the streets of the land of Israel in 1928 during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]], 77 pottery villages (of individuals or groups) were listed, while in the 1931 census, 211 different pottery villages were listed.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ziffer, Irit, "Water Vessels in Traditional Arab Pottery," in To the ''Fountain: The Maiden and the Jar: A Local and Multi-Cultural Image'', Kenaan-Kedar, Nurith (Curator) (Tel Aviv: Eretz Israel Museum, 2013), 60. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the pottery villages were centralized, based on geographical proximity of the potters' families. Examples of this can be found in the pottery workshops held in the pottery villages in Rashia al Fakhar ([[Tel Faher]]) at the foot of [[Mount Hermon]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Feldman,Nir, ''Material From the Wind: Chava Samuel, a Pioneer of Ceramic Art in Israel'' (Rishon LeZion: Rishon LeZion Museum, 2011), 11. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Or in [[Hebron]], at the various workshops of the Alfahori family. These pots were fired at a low temperature in traditional kilns that burned wood, charcoal, or animal droppings. Different workshops were held in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] as well, where they produced unique black pottery (فخار اسود), produced by adding organic materials, such as barley husks, to the kiln or by reduction firing. The smoke from the process of the burning of these materials within the kiln lent the pottery its characteristic black color.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ziffer, Irit, "Water Vessels in Traditional Arab Pottery," in ''To the Fountain: The Maiden and the Jar: A Local and Multi-Cultural Image'', Kenaan-Kedar, Nurith(Curator) (Tel Aviv: Eretz Israel Museum, 2013), 47-48 [in Hebrew], and: Ziffer, Irit ,"A  Healthy Foundation for the Creations of the Younger Generation – A Note on Israeli Pottery Tradition,"  in ''The Third Biennale of Israeli Ceramics'' (Exhibition catalogue, Mark Tsatsula, ed.), Tel Aviv: Eretz Israel Museum, 2005), 110. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a tradition existed of producing pots made of clay mixed with straw or gravel for cooking and other utilitarian uses by the local population.  This work was carried out by hand by women, and the pots were fired in improvised kilns, in kitchen ovens, or sometimes not fired at all.  Pottery of this type, which was produced in the Samaria area and in [[Ramallah]], for example, was typically decorated with color made from rusted iron that originated in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Irit Ziffer, "A Healthy Foundation for the Creations of the Younger Generation – A Note on Israeli Pottery Tradition," in ''The Third Biennale of Israeli Ceramics'' (Exhibition catalogue, Mark Tsatsula, ed.), Tel Aviv: Eretz Israel Museum, 2005), 110. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the century progressed, this tradition began dying out as a result of industrialization, and in addition, from the 1980s competing pottery from other countries began to be imported.&lt;ref&gt;See: Shlomit Bauman, "Detachment and Continuity as an Influence on Creative Processes in Israeli Ceramic Design," ''History and Theory'', Bezalel II/16 – Creation Modes: Jewelry and Fashion, April 2010.

===Armenian ceramic art===
[[File:Armenian Room P1130760.JPG|thumb|right|250 px|Armenian Ceramics at the Jerusalem House of Quality ([[Saint John Eye Hospital Group]]), Jerusalem]]

In 1919 the British Mandate government invited a group of [[Armenians|Armenian]] potters, survivors of the Armenian Genocide, to repair the ceramic tiles of the [[Dome of the Rock]].  This experiment indicated the British interest in traditional art of the Arts and Crafts movement. Armenian ceramic art can be traced back to the 15th century, to the Turkish cities of [[İznik]] and [[Kütahya]], but the combination of the ancient art of the Land of Israel and Christian motifs created a unique artistic synthesis.

The outstanding artist of the early years was [[David Ohannessian]], who specialized in the design of ceramic decorative art in buildings and monuments, many of which were commissioned by the British Mandate government. The workshop that he founded – "The Dome of the Rock Tiles" – produced not only monumental works, but also utilitarian and decorative pottery. Among the most important works Ohannessian produced in Jerusalem were tiles for the [[American Colony Hotel]] (1923), the fountain house in St. John's Hospital, the tiled dome in the [[Rockefeller Museum]] garden, etc. Among the motifs that appear in his decorations are the [[Cypress]]es trees, [[tulip]]s, and grapevines typical of traditional Seljuk and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] decorative art.&lt;ref&gt;See: Nurith  Kenaan-Kedar, ''The Armenian Ceramics of Jerusalem'' (Jerusalem: Yad Izhak Ben-Zvi, 2002), 29-52.  [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Ohannessian introduced some unique Jerusalem iconography to his works, figures derived from Armenian medieval illuminations, historic designs and forms from European renaissance majolica, and bird motifs drawn from an Armenian Jerusalem 5th-6th century mosaic floor, discovered during an archeological dig in the Holy City during the 1890s, to name a few.

The workshop that Ohannessian founded in Jerusalem followed the tradition of ceramic making as he had practiced and overseen it in his atelier in Kutahya, in Ottoman Anatolia, which had flourished prior to World War I and his deportation to the Syrian desert. According to traditional methods, the processes of clay and glaze mixing, wheel throwing, design, painting, and firing were performed by a variety of artisans, all supervised by Ohannessian, some of whom specialized in design and others who were experts at the potter's wheel. Ohannessian was skilled himself in all facets of the art and trained a variety of apprentices, as he had done in Anatolia. He maintained particular expertise in painting ceramics and design. Upon the founding of his workshop on the Via Dolorosa, he cooperated with [[Near East Relief]], to train a number of Armenian orphans of the genocide, giving them the skills to engage in the art on a professional basis. Some of his workshop's output, especially the monumental architectural tile works, were signed by the chief artist. Numerous other vases and plates identified their respective makers through small glazed initials on the bottom, usually painted in ochre. Ohannessian's workshop used a stone wood-burning kiln, built to his specifications in 1919.  The model implemented in this workshop was used for other Armenian workshops founded subsequently in Jerusalem.

The artists [[Megardish Karakashian]] and [[Nishan Balian]], who left Ohannessian's workshop in 1922, founded a workshop together called "Palestine Pottery," where they developed a line of design with figurative images that were alien to traditional Turkish ceramic art.  For example, the two of them combined designs from ancient mosaics discovered in the Land of Israel, such as the "Birds Mosaic" (Jerusalem) or the mosaic from [[Hisham's Palace]] in [[Jericho]]. Often these images were imbued with Christian  theological interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;See: Nurith Kenaan-Kedar, ''The Armenian Ceramics of Jerusalem'' (Jerusalem: Yad Izhak Ben-Zvi, 2002), 53-91. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The joint workshop functioned continually until 1964, when Stefan Karakashian&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Stern, "Beit Hayotzer at Netiv Hayisurim," ''Al Hamishmar'', (18 August 1967). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; and Marie Balian, heirs of the founders, founded two separate workshops that made use of images from the past as well as new images that they created.

===The ceramics of Bezalel===

Within the framework of the "[[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design|Beazlel School of Art and Craft]]", a ceramics studio was founded in 1924, with [[Jacob Eisenberg]] at its head.&lt;ref&gt;Nurit Shilo-Cohen, ''Schatz's "Bezalel," 1906-1929'' (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1980), 364.  [in Hebrew]  These were the last years (1920-1929) of the institution that saw itself during this period less and less as an academy of art, and more and more as a series of partially independent art workshops.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1917 [[Boris Schatz]] was considering opening a department for the design of cast decorative items, as well as a department of painting on "porcelain."  This craft was already being taught at Bezalel using ready-made porcelain brought in from outside Palestine for use at Bezalel.&lt;ref&gt;See: Boris Schatz, "How to Encourage and Promote Home Crafts in Jerusalem and in Eretz Israel in General," printed in: ''Bezalel: 1906-1929'', ed. Nurit Shilo-Cohen (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1980), 149-186, especially 173-175, and also: Bezalel 100, Book 1, ed. David Tartakover and Gideon Ofrat (Jerusalem: Hapais Council for the Culture and Arts, 2006), 174. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Schatz saw in the activity of the factory for bricks and roofing tiles that operated on the grounds of the "[[Schneller Orphanage]]" in Jerusalem from approximately 1895, proof of the practicality of such a local industry, which would make use of local materials brought from [[Motza]].

Eisenberg, who was a student at Bezalel from 1913 to 1919, after his graduation went to study in [[Vienna]], at the School for Arts and Crafts, where he took a continuing education course in ceramic design and production.&lt;ref&gt;Many of Bezalel's pupils, such as [[Nachum Gutman]], [[Israel Hirschfeld]], and others, went to [[Vienna]] for training.&lt;/ref&gt; The department separated the design of the ceramics, mostly taught by Bezalel instructors and particularly by [[Ze'ev Raban]], from the practical production of the pieces.  Of the objects produced in this department, the best known are the wall tiles and decorations from the 1920s and 1930s. These works include the tiles on the walls of the Ahad HaAm School, the [[Bialik House]], and the Lederberg House in Tel Aviv, and in the synagogue of Moshav Zekanim.

The style of tile design was influenced by Art [[Art Nouveau]] and by the "[[Jugendstil]] style.  This style is expressed in the flatness of the area described and in the richly decorated borders.  With regard to ideas, "Bezalel tiles" expressed a tendency toward transcendentalism, seen in their borders cast with images taken from [[Jewish]] tradition and [[Zionism|Zionist]] content.&lt;ref&gt;See: Alec Mishory, ""Zionist Resurrection on the Facade of 'The Municipal School' in Tel-Aviv," in ''Lo and Behold'' (Tel Aviv, Am Oved, 2000), 94-116. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning of Hebrew ceramics, 1932–1950==
[[File:Mira libes and hava samuel next to the kiln.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|[[Mira libes]] (left) and [[Chava Samuel]] (right) next to the kiln, [[Rishon LeZion]]]]
In her article "Techno Tools: The Logical Ones" (2011),&lt;ref&gt;Shlomit Bauman, "Ceramic design: Techno.logical Implements," ''Sixth Biennale of Israeli Ceramics'' (Tel Aviv: Eretz Israel Museum, 2011). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shlomit Bauman]] maintained that contemporary Israeli ceramics is characterized by a disconnect from the Palestinian tradition and by "a lack of a local ceramics industry that would permit a dialog of understanding between local ceramic artists."&lt;ref&gt;Shlomit Bauman, "Ceramic design: Techno.logical Implements," ''Sixth Biennale of Israeli Ceramics'' (Tel Aviv: Eretz Israel Museum, 2011), pp 10-11 [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as the Armenians and the Arabs living in the Palestine worked within independent traditions, Jewish artists had to create a synthesis between European art and art in the Land of Israel under the conditions that existed there in the early 20th century.  This can be seen both in the design of the models and in the work techniques, which tended to be mechanized. In addition, while local pottery depended on family-led workshops and on cooperative activity by the artists, the Jewish potter saw himself both as an artist and as an expression of the language of art.&lt;ref&gt;See: ^Shlomit Bauman, "Materialism Liberated," Joram Rosenheimer, ed., ''Maud Friedland'' ([Tel Aviv]: Rosenheimer family, in collaboration with: Ceramic Artists Association of Israel, 2011), 13. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chava (Eva) Samuel|Chava Samuel]], who Immigrated to the Palestine in 1932, founded "Hayozer" [The Creator], the first ceramics workshop in the Jewish community in Jerusalem. "Kad VeSefel" [Jug and Cup], the ceramics workshop founded in 1934 in [[Rishon LeZion]] with [[Paula Ahronson]], produced a variety of utilitarian pots and decorative pottery, using a combination of potter's wheel and ceramic casting. The style of the pots was, for the most part functional, influenced both by the spirit of [[modernism]] and the European [[Bauhaus]] style. [[Mira Libes]], a pupil in the workshop of Samuel and Ahronson, described the pottery produced in the workshop as the direct result of "create pottery that is simple, functional, and beautiful," a philosophy intended also to improve public taste, which was deemed at that time indescribably bad. The pottery produced was generally influenced by the "Bauhaus" style, which Paula had studied, and the simple and beautiful decorative-colorful style of Eva."[18]

The motifs of the decorations on Samuel's pottery were also influenced by the archeology of the Land of Israel, as well as by Oriental art, under whose influence she produced "Eastern" images and images from the Jewish world. As opposed to the figures from the Jewish world created by the artists of the "Bezalel" school, Samuel's imaged lacked the religious dimension. The images that remained, for the most part looked like images from folklore. The decorative style of Samuel's pottery focused on individual images, drawn primarily freehand and glazed.&lt;ref&gt;Chava Samuel – Ceramicist (Jerusalem: Bezalel, 1985. Cited in: Gideon Ofrat, ''The Beginnings of Israeli Ceramics'', 1932-1962, note 3, Ceramic Artists Association of Israel. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the pottery of Samuel and Ahronson, the works of [[Hedwig Grossman]] displayed an attempt to formulate a Land of Israel "localness" in their ceramic design. Grossman made [[Aliyah]] to the Land of Israel in 1933 after studying pottery in Germany. During her first years in Palestine, Grossman already began to carry out soil surveys to determine how local materials were used in pottery production. In addition, Grossman researched how pottery was made in the Land of Israel in ancient times and what where the work methods of Arab and Armenian potters throughout the Land. In her work Grossman emphasized the use of materials from the Land of Israel. Some of her work was even influenced by local archaeological findings. Her techniques for working the material included basic geometric decoration, using local non-glaze slips ([[Slipware|engobes]]) in assorted colors.

An echo of Grossman's views can be seen in the 1940s, when [[Jacob Lev]], who served from 1939 as the head of the Sculpture Department in the "[[Bezalel|New Bezalel]]," began to offer classes in pottery in the department. Most of the pots that were made in this institution were not fired in a kiln and so did not survive, but in his article "The Pretty Pot"&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Lev, "The Pretty Pot," in: ''Bezalel ha-Hadash'' [The New Bezalel: Journal of Problems in Artistic Design] (Jerusalem: New Bezalel), no. 1 ( 941). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; (1941), he emphasizes the modernist approach to design of the pot and the relationship between its parts in the "Bauhaus" spirit. However photographs of the pots show the influence of the architecture of the Land of Israel in the choice of the types of pots, as well as in the avoidance of decoration in the rough texture of their design.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ''Bezalel ha-Hadash'' [The New Bezalel: Journal of Problems in Artistic Design] (Jerusalem: Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design), 1987. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The works of [[Hedwig Harag Zunz]], who arrived in the Land of Israel at the beginning of the 1940s, also represent an attempt at creating pottery with a Land of Israel "localness." In Zunz's works this was expressed primarily in her choice of local materials. Most of her work was produced using a potter's wheel, but she also created pottery with an architectural bent. In spite of her consistent use of local materials, Zunz's works differ from the archaeological direction of Hedwig Grossman's works or the oriental decoration of Eva Samuel's.  The shape of her pottery was influenced by European Modernism in its lack of decoration and in its organic tendency toward the use of the glossy surface slips of [[Terra sigillata]] or ceramic glazes.&lt;ref&gt;See: Michal Alon, "Hanna Harag Zunz: Pioneer in Ceramic Art," ''1280°c''. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her independent works, Harag Zunz also produced technical academic research and participated in various industrial projects.

==From landscape to clay, 1950–1980==
In the 1950s and 1960s there was an upswing in ceramic activity in Israel, and steps were taken toward institutionalizing ceramics as a branch of art. Alongside traditional pottery and the newly established "Studio Pottery", other forms of media began to develop, including ceramic sculpture and industrial initiatives, a small-scale industry that took its spiritual roots from European Modernism. In general, ceramic artists, like many other Israeli artists, strove toward "localness", with its identification with the land, the landscape, and the archaeology of the Land of Israel.

===Industrialization===
[[file:Harsa003.jpg|250 px|thumb|right|[[Nehemia Azaz]] at [[Harsa Ceramics]]]]
[[file:Lapid 001.jpg|250 px|thumb|right|Vases from Lapid and Harsa Ceramics, [[Davar]], 23 October 1959]]
From the very beginning of the ceramics industry in Israel, ceramic objects were produced in casting molds.  However, the development of the Zionist industry gave impetus to speedy industrialization.[24]  The main area in which the ceramics industry developed was Haifa, where in 1938 "[[Naaman]]" where cast porcelain objects were produced, was founded.[25]  In the exhibition "Applied Art and the Prescription for Industry in the Land of Israel," held in the [[Bezalel Museum]] in Jerusalem in 1947, glazed pots were displayed by [[Hanna Harag Zunz]] as an example of cooperation among various elements of the industry.[26] In 1955 in the [[Haifa Museum of Art]] an exhibition entitled "The Ceramic Society" was mounted, in which objects and the processes of their production in the local ceramics industry were displayed.&lt;ref&gt;See: Pesel Fridberg, "Exhibition: 'The Ceramic Company', Haifa Museum of Art," ''AlHamishmar'', 30 December 1955. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950s saw the beginning of practical cooperation between the ceramics industry and the designers and artists in the young state, with an eye to advancing the industry and raising its prestige. Similar initiatives took place in the 1960s in Israel Ceramic and Silicate Institute in the Technion, and in Bezalel, where they began testing ceramic materials for design.

[[Aharon Kahana]] - who with his wife founded "Beit Hayotzer" [Artisan's Workshop] (Haifa), which was so large he employed three assistant potters—succeeded in defining a widespread style that combined modernist abstraction with decorative folk motifs. This combination succeeded in "returning art to the people."&lt;ref name="AlHamishmar 6 February 1959"&gt;''AlHamishmar'', 6 February 1959 [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; and "making use of many shapes, which had been unacceptable in the eyes of the viewers, as decoration for ceramic creations.&lt;ref name="AlHamishmar 6 February 1959"/&gt;

Among the better known ceramic production plants were "Kol-Keramic" (Haifa), "Carnet" (Netanya Ceramics),"Ceramit" (Netanya) "Beit Halachmi" (Tel Aviv), "Bror Hayil (Bror Hayil), "Keramaklin" (Nes Tziona), "Palkeramic" (Haifa), and "Beit Hayotzer" (Ramat Gan/Petah Tikva), the ceramics workshop of Kfar Menachem, etc.  At the same time, the two most important factories were "Lapid Pottery" (1951) and "Harsa Ceramics (1956)," which combined technology with handmade techniques.

In 1952 Elisabeth Cohen came to work as a designer for Lapid Pottery.  Elisabeth Cohen had studied with Hedwig Grossman and founded the "art" department in the company.  By 1959 this department employed 20 people.&lt;ref&gt;See: Beitar, "Lapid Produces New Bathroom Fixtures," ''Davar'', 28 March 1956. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning the company produced utilitarian pots cast from the materials used to cast toilets, but little by little both the methods and the designs of the company became more sophisticated.  In addition to Cohen other designers, including [[Maud Friedland]], came to work for the company. Another art department produced ceramics in the [[Harsa Ceramics company]] from 1956-1966.&lt;ref&gt;See: Pnina Arouetty, ''Earthenware Pottery, 1956-1966'' (Ramat Gan: Beit Aharon Kahana, 2007). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  The department was founded by [[Nehemia Azaz]], who designed his pots using local colors and materials.&lt;ref&gt;See: Israeli, Art, "The Department of 'Earthenware' Art 1955-1966," ''1280o C'', 27 Summer (2013), 24-18. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak, the department employed 30 workers. After Azaz left the department, it was run by [[Pnina Zamir Amir]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Pnina Arouetty, ''Pnina Amir-Zamir'' (Ramat Gan: Beit Aharon Kahana, 2010). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The articles made in both companies were modernist in style and were characterized by the use of geometric styles and primarily abstract decoration.  These designs were influenced by the tradition of modernist design, from designs created in Europe during this same period, and therefore by what was perceived as the expression of Land of Israel "localness."  Azaz, for example, stated that his forms were influenced by the desert landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Aviva Limon, "''Interview with Nehemia Azaz''," (in Hebrew), 6 May 1990, can be found in the Information Center for Israeli Art, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem and in the archive of Beit Benyamini, Tel Aviv.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of porcelain by ceramics companies was concentrated for the most part in the "Naaman" and "Lapid" factories, both of which produced primarily utilitarian utensils. At the same time it is known that the industry tried to encourage local design.  Shimon Badar, for example, who was the first designer for "Naaman," also served as a lecturer on ceramic technology at the Ceramic Department of Bezalel.&lt;ref&gt;See: Shir Mellor-Yamaguchi and Anat Turbowicz, ''White Matter: Contemporary Porcelain Sculpture'' (Kibbutz Hazorea: Wilfrid Israel Museum, 2015), 5. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a large scale technological–artistic project  is the covering of the entrance to Asia House (1977-1979) in tiles produced in the porcelain molds next to "Naaman" and designed by the artist  Pinchas Eshet.&lt;ref&gt;See: ''Pinchas Eshet, Porcelain Sculptures'' (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Modern Art, 1980,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studio pottery===
The 1950s and 1960s were the most important years of ceramic activity in the field of Israeli art.  For the first time ceramic artists began to be trained in many private workshops and a variety of academic institutions.  In addition, decorative arts –including ceramic art – were no longer perceived as a foreign element in the young Israeli culture.  To a large extent these forms of media were encouraged by various government agencies.  Finally, an examination of the creations of the artists demonstrates the inculcation of a local artistic "tradition" that chose to cut itself off from the Arab ceramic tradition, the Armenian tradition, and even that of Bezalel, in favor of "modernism" and "localness," which determined the central direction of Israeli ceramics until the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;See the definition of Sarah Chinsky for the project inventing the Bezalel "tradition."  Sarah Chinsky, ''The Monarchy of the Land of the Humble: the Social Grammar of Local Art'' (Tel Aviv: HaKibbutz HaMeuhad, 2015), 96-97. [In Hebrew].&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[Hedwig Grossman]], who taught most young ceramicists in her Jerusalem studio and in [[Ein Hod]], and from 1964 in [[Givatayim]], [[Hanna Harag Zunz]] also taught them in the Oranim Seminar (today [[Oranim Academic College]]), [[Paula Ahronson]] at Wizo in Tel Aviv, and [[Gedula Ogen]] at Havat HaNoar HaTzioni (Israel Goldstein Youth Village).  In 1957 the department of ceramics at The Arts Institute at Tel-Hai College opened.&lt;ref&gt;See: Tel Hai College, Pottery, 7, August (1980), 3-7. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1958 the Department of Ceramics and Glass Design at [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design]] was founded, next to the Schneller Orphanage.  The department was headed by David Wachtel, who had worked previously at the "Palkeramics" factory.  His teaching faculty included [[David Calderon]], [[Pnina Amir-Zamir]], and Maud Friedland.  In 1962 Gedula Ogen was appointed head of the department.&lt;ref&gt;See: ''Bezalel 100, Book 2, 1935-1965'', David Tartakover and Gideon Ofrat, eds. (Tel Aviv: The National Lottery Council for Arts and Culture, 2006), 189. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1961 and 1963 the number of students in the department grew from 26 to 50, and the amount of work space in the department  greatly increased.[38]  Another teaching institution was the "Visual Arts Center" in Beersheba.&lt;ref&gt;See: ''Bezalel 100, Book 2, 1935-1965'', David Tartakover and Gideon Ofrat, eds. (Tel Aviv: The National Lottery Council for Arts and Culture, 2006), 191, 201. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the standpoint of design, the ceramicists continued the tradition of Harag Zunz and particularly the tradition of Grossman, in everything connected to the spirit of European Modernism and in the aspiration toward the expression of what was local in their works.  Among the most significant followers of Grossman are Amnon Israeli and Gedula Ogen. From the 1960s both of them took the inspiration for their work from archaeology and the Land of Israel landscape, expressed in works that were unglazed and coated in slip&lt;ref&gt;A color based on liquid clay mixed with natural and artificial pigments.  Close variations are called "slip."&lt;/ref&gt; or exposed to an open fire during their firing.&lt;ref&gt;See: Inna Arouetty, ''Gedula Ogen: Like Nature'' (Ramat Gan: Beit Aharon Kahana, 1996).  Also, Inna Arouetty, Hedwig Grossman/Amnon Israel  (Ramat Gan: Beit Aharon Kahana,2014). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent ceramic artists were [[Yehudit Meir]] and [[Yocheved Marx]], who worked together in Beersheba from 1958, using local materials from the earth of the Negev and fired their works at very high temperatures (1250-1300 degrees C), which was atypical for Israeli ceramicists of that period.   The works they created spanned the field from decorative to practical.

The opportunities for exhibiting and selling ceramics during that period were limited and led to the production, for the most part, of practical ceramic ware. Along with exhibitions at "Mikra-Studio" gallery (Tel Aviv, 1946-1956), which combined emphasizing artistic values with exhibiting female ceramic artists,&lt;ref&gt;Among those displaying in the gallery in the field of sculpture: Aharon Kahana (1952), Hava Mehutan (1955), Nehemia Azaz (1956).  Moshe Gershuni, for example, reported that he acquired works by Kahana, Harag Zunz, Hedwig Grossman, Jean Mayer, and others in this gallery and in the store in the neighboring building on the corner of Ben Yehudah and Idelson Streets.  See: Moshe Gershuni, "Indian Ceramics," in Sarah Breitberg Semel, Gershuni (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2010), 314. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; and "Atelier 97" (Tel Aviv),&lt;ref&gt;Chava Samuel (1960), Shelly Harari (1960), Jean Mayer&lt;/ref&gt; ceramics were sold at the Maskit stores (Tel Aviv, 1959- ?), which emphasized folkloristic elements.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the artists mounted entire exhibitions, while others displayed their works in a group exhibition or displayed special art objects for sale. The following names were listed on the exhibit: Idit Adi and Miriam Magnus (1968), Hanna Baharal (1966, 1970), Rina Peled (1969, 1971), Miriam Zamir (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition there were a number of exhibitions of ceramic art at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and at the Bezalel Museum and at a variety of private stores.&lt;ref&gt;In the brochure Kad ve-sefer , for example, there is a list of branches of "Maskit," "Tuv taam", and "Tessora" stores in Tel Aviv, and "Charlotte" and the "Schwartz" department store in Jerusalem.  See: Nir Feldman, Material From the Wind: Chava Samuel, a Pioneer of Ceramic Art in Israel (Rishon LeZion: Rishon LeZion Museum, 2011),83. [in Hebrew]  Bertha Ordung's daughter described Hedwig Grossman's works, which were offered for sale in Rina Galleria in Jerusalem.  Other stores include "Ginger" in Jerusalem, "Traklin" and "Herzog" in Haifa, and "Galeria 119" in Tel Aviv.&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelming majority of ceramic artists were not members of a professional artists' union, and if they were, like Grossman and Samuel, within that framework they exhibited primarily paintings and prints.  In 1966 in Tel Aviv the "Clay Museum" opened as part of the Eretz Israel Museum, exhibiting ancient ceramics next to exhibitions of Israeli artists who exhibited in the open courtyard of the pavilion.  In 1968 the Ceramic Artists Association of Israel was founded, headed by Joseph Blumenthal.

In 1963 the book Art in Israel was published, under the editorship of [[Benjamin Tammuz]].&lt;ref&gt;See: ''Art in Israel'', Benjamin Tammuz, ed., (Tel Aviv: Masada, 1963).  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The book devoted an entire chapter to art that John Cheney compiled.  In this chapter, which was accompanied by a number of photographs, Cheney surveyed such areas of art as design, jewelry making, and ceramics, which he juxtaposed to media such as drawing, sculpture, and architecture.  The presentation of ceramics and the rest of the arts as equal to other artistic media, bears witness to the importance of art during those years and its promotion by exhibitions and competitions organized by institutions such as the Israel Packaging Institute and the Israel Export Institution, etc.  On 24 September 1970, an exhibition opened in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art that surveyed the field of ceramics in Israel and was the ultimate expression of this trend.  The exhibition – "Israel Ceramics 70" – displayed 284 works of 64 artists, along with a detailed catalog that included photographs of the works as well.  In addition the works produced by another five factories ("Beit Hayotser," "Lapid," "Naaman," "Palkeramic," and "Carnet."&lt;ref&gt;See Haim Gamzo, ''Israel Ceramics 70'' (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1970). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Ein Hod school===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 13693 Ceramic wall by Louise Schatz Ein Hod.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Ceramic wall by [[Louise Schatz]], Ein Hod]]
In 1957, in close proximity to one another, [[Itche Mambush]] and his wife [[Aviva Margalit]] opened pottery workshops in [[Ein Hod]] Artists Village. The village was founded in 1953 by [[Marcel Janco]], as a village for the arts and artists. Around the workshops a group of resident artists and artists who lived nearby began to add ceramics to one of the media in which they worked. Some of these artists were identified with "New Horizons," that is, Janco, [[Yehezkel Streichman]], [[Pinchas Abramovich]], and [[Aharon Kahana]], who worked alongside artists for whom the decorative style was an integral part of their art, such as [[Louise Schatz]], [[Bezalel Schatz]], [[Jean David]], [[Genia Berger]], etc.

In their works we see a colorful, expressive approach with an emphasis on glazes not typical of the "material" tradition in local ceramics. In addition to a small amount of ceramic sculpture, these artists produced many paintings using glazing techniques, and murals using a variety of glazed ceramic tiles.&lt;ref&gt;See: Galia Bar Or and Gideon Ofrat, ''The First Decade: A Hegemony and a Plurality'' (Ein Harod: Mishkan Museum of Art, 2008), 22-23; See also: Gideon Ofrat, Archeological Ceramics: Pottery and Walls ' Aharon Kahana, Monograph (5), on the website Gideon Ofrat's Storeroom [In Hebrew].&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the artists worked the materials themselves, while others produced detailed sketches for items to be implemented in different workshops, such as the ones in Ein Hod or the one in [[Kfar Menachem]].
 
These decorative walls were part of the trend towards combining art with local architecture, and were used by other artists along with other techniques such as sgrafitto and mosaics.  One of the best known artistic event in this field took place in 1954, when a group of ceramic wall paintings by [[Aharon Kahana]], [[Jean David]], and [[Gedula Ogen]] were put in place on the [[Givat Ram]] campus of [[The Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. In 1958 sketches of these walls were even presented in the exhibition "Ten Years of Architecture in Israel" in the [[Tel Aviv Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Rachel Engel, "Between Painters and Architects: Architectural Exhibition at the Tel Aviv Museum," ''Davar'', 3 October 1958. [In Hebrew].&lt;/ref&gt; The peak of this creativity was in 1966, when an international hands-on seminar in ceramics took place in Ein Hod, at Berger's initiative.

In the second half of the 1960s the influence of different kinds of media began to appear in the works of Israeli ceramicists.  In particular the influence of Israeli sculptors could be seen. Along with the continuing use of "architectural" images and the trend toward "localness," it could be seen in the use of images of the land and desert landscapes, a divergence from the boundaries of traditional ceramics.  The aspiration toward copying nature into works of art forced the artists into seeking new artistic expressions.

The status of Land of Israel architecture as the expression of Zionist nationalism attracted not only the broad public, but also many ceramicists, to it.&lt;ref&gt;An example of this kind of connection can be found in the dictionary of Hebrew pottery terms published in 1950 by the Hebrew Language Committee (Dictionary of Pottery Terms [Jerusalem: Hebrew Language Committee, with the participation of the Bialik Institute, 1950]). See: Meira Yagid-Haimovich, Israeli Pottery: A Footnote; ''Irit Abba, Wheel. Period'' (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2009), 6. [In Hebrew] This dictionary was the work of the "Committee for Architectural Terms," which comprised a natural bridge between architecture, ceramics, and pottery of that period.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them utilized the skills they had acquired in the restoration of pottery, which was found in great numbers in the archeological digs of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;See: Michael Feige, Tzvi Shiloni, eds. ''A Pickaxe to Dig With: Archeology and Nationalism in the Land of Israel'' (Beer-Sheva: Ben Gurion University of the Negev, 2008). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was natural, therefore, that architectural images appeared in the works of Israeli artists.  A whole group of artists such as [[David Ben Shaul]], [[Agi Yoeli]], [[David Calderon]], [[Moshe Shek]], and [[Shelly Harari]], in addition to their ceramic works, produced during this period human sculptures or animal images inspired by figurines and statuettes from antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;See: Benjamin Tammuz, ed. ''The Story of Art in Israel'' (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishers, 1980), 155-156. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Their works included a pioneering Zionist element that expressed an attempt to connect the young Israeli state with its historical and biblical past.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, "The Dialectics of the 1950s," in: Galia Bar-Or and Gideon Ofrat, The First Decade: A Hegemony and a Plurality (Ein Harod: Museum of Art, Ein Harod, 2008), 24. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Israeli ceramicists showed a tendency toward modernism, which emphasized the geometric character of the shape and the work and showed the influence of European modernism.

Most of the characteristics of sculpture can be found in works that originated on potter's wheels during those years.  A central element in the widespread distribution of works of this genre was the teaching of Gedula Ogen at Bezalel.  Ogen developed a style using the potter's wheel to achieve the volume needed for large scale relief sculpture and figurative sculpture.  In her works she continued Grossman's style of design in her emphasis on the naturally colorful quality of the material.  Most of her work dealt with images from nature and with the relationship between it and culture and art.

The main reason for the shift in style during the 1960s that deviated from the previous tradition by opening the field of Israeli ceramics to varied new points of view, was the arrival and influence of ceramics producers and professional ceramic artists, the practical implementation of which could be seen in the works of David Morris, Magdalena Hefetz, Sonia Natra and others who studied and became specialists in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Ofrat, The Beginning of Israeli Ceramics 1932-1962, 17. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

An article from 1972 describes the creation of one of these sculptures by [[Rina Peleg]], a graduate of Bezalel, who "leaning heavily on the potter's wheel and round motions, creates the body of her sculpture. Only after this does she knead and shape the finished form with her hands, creating its decoration and ornamentation."&lt;ref name="Plank 36-39"&gt;Shlomit Bauman, "Shlomit Bauman in a Conversation with Rina Kimchi, 'A Plank in a Burned-out House'," ''1280°'', 11 (2004), 36-39. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; However she soon began to request that the artists "jettison the jug"&lt;ref name="Plank 36-39"/&gt; and the decorative dimension of traditional ceramics in favor of freestanding art.  Artists such as [[Neta Avraham]], Shelly Harari, [[Nora and Naomi]], [[Jean Meir]], Maud Friedland, and others, deviated from the tradition of "sculpting with the potter's wheel" in order to try out different techniques, particularly freestanding sculpture.  A central motif was the imitation of formations found in local landscapes and their conversion into objects of sculpture.

The Israeli landscape, especially the desert landscape, was perceived as isolated from modern westernized society, and served as an inspiration to artists in creating the form, texture, and color of artistic objects.  In this way these artists joined the general trend among many other Israeli artists who created in their works images of an archaic utopia, many of them even under the late influence of "Canaanite" art.  The objects they created tended towards abstract plant structures or towards the building of objects that suggested archaic cultural structures.

As ceramics drew closer to the field of art, however, foreign influences also creeped into the Israeli tradition.  [[Siona Shimshi]], for example, during these years returned from studies in the United States, where she had been exposed to postmodern art, such as Pop Art.  Her ceramic works combined these influences with biographical works and psychological images.  For example, in her works such as "Puppet Theater"
&lt;ref&gt;For photo of the work: See: Haim Gamzo, ''Israeli Ceramics 70'' (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1970). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; or "Class Photo 1939" (1965), the artist aimed to express psychological and social themes, something that was unusual in Israeli ceramics of the time.&lt;ref&gt;See Aya Miron, "Ziona Shemesh," in: ''1965 Today'', Mira Lapidot, Curator (Jerusalem: Israel Museum, 2015), 138-241.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1960s, large scale sculptures began to appear in Israeli art, such as the bronze sculpture "Sheep of the Negev" by [[Itzhak Danziger]], Assemblage art works, such as those of [[Igael Tumarkin]] and [[Yehiel Shemi]], or works making use of various techniques such as installations or the use of non-artistic materials, such as those created by the artists of the group "Ten Plus," while at the same time ceramic works continued to be limited by the size of the kilns in which they were fired.  However, apparently it was the influence of conceptual art, which arrived in Israel in the 1970s, that cut off ceramic activity from Israeli art.  This is particularly noticeable against the background of "earth" and "place" imagery among the Israeli artistic vanguard of this period.

==From deconstruction to reconstruction, 1980–2010==
In the 1980s a fundamental change occurred in the way Israeli ceramic art was perceived.  The primary cause of the change was the disruption of the local tradition in Israeli ceramics.  Some of the reasons can be discerned in the perception of a break which Israeli society felt in a delayed reaction to the [[Yom Kippur War]], and in reaction to the First Intifada.&lt;ref&gt;Ilana Tannenbaum, "The Time of the Post: the 1980s in Israeli Art," in: ''Check Post: the 1980s in Israeli Art'' (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Art, 2008), 23-24. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the influence of postmodern culture began to trickle into the local culture.

Even though postmodernism had once been described as the expression of "the personal, [with a tendency towards the] hand-made, metaphorical, figurative, [and] decorative",&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Ofrat, "Post Modernism," ''Achshav'', 47-48 (1983), 270.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; traits that came naturally to Israeli ceramic artists and their art, paradoxically the distance between them and mainstream Israeli art widened.  At the same time, in painting, sculpture, and photography objections began to be heard against the status of the object as a work of art, whereas until the 1990s the field of Israeli ceramics had primarily adopted the attitude of "identity politics," as the central tenet of postmodernism.  In place of historical and archeological relationships, a series of personal relationships began to appear, most of them expressivist, which deviated from the traditional Israeli ceramic tradition that had existed up to this time.

This sidelining of ceramics, and especially of pottery, from the main museums,&lt;ref&gt;Until 1993, when Lidia Zavatsky had an exhibition, there had never been an exhibition of ceramics (ceramic design and pottery) in the department of Design and Architecture of the Israel Museum.  See: Design and Architecture in the Israel Museum: Portrait of a Department 1973-1997 (Jerusalem: Israel Museum). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It is true that Gideon Ofrat mentioned in the chapter dealing with "Canaan" in ''The Story of Art in Israel'', Benjamin Tammuz, ed. (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishers, 1980), the attention the field of art paid to the early days of Israeli ceramics and to Ziona Shemesh, in her interview in Eser Plus, but it is well known that the part that the various design media played is missing from the history of Israeli art.&lt;/ref&gt; led to the establishment of a number of independent cooperative galleries in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv,&lt;ref&gt;See: Yigal Zalmona, ''100 Years of Israeli Art'' (Jerusalem: Israel Museum, 2010), 336. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; for the display and merchandising of ceramics, such as "Ruach Cadim" (1987), the  "Altogether 8" group (1990), and "Shlush Shloshim (1992).  In 1991 Aharon Kahana's house in [[Ramat Gan]] was opened as a ceramics gallery.

===Myths in the material, 1980-1990===
In spite of the marginal place the medium occupied, postmodern expressions in ceramics did have a certain impact because of the works of [[Gideon Ofrat]], one of the most important of the artists who translated postmodern thinking into an aesthetic in the 1980s. In 1985 Ofrat curated the exhibition "Toward a Myth Without God" in the [[Jerusalem Artists House]].  In the exhibition catalog, Ofrat described ceramics as an expression of metaphysics, and pottery and pots as a means of direct connection to nature.  A connection that Ofrat described as a dialectic of "proceeding toward a double eternity – an eternity of absorbing living and an eternity of absorbing dying"&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Ofrat, Towards a Godless Myth (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Artists House, 1985), 63. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; connected to the practicality and the symbolism of the pottery.  In this Ofrat reflected the phenomology of Martin Heidegger and Derrida, who emphasized earth and object (and the pitcher as a characteristic expression of this) as an intersection between life and death.&lt;ref&gt;See also the later article of Ofrat, "The Slopes and the Names." [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the artists sought to probe the personal and the biographical through archetypal images, and thus express the symbolic dimension of art.  From the point of view of form, it was manifested by developing means of sculptural expression in a more figurative direction and with a tendency toward ignoring the individual object in favor of the sculptural array.&lt;ref&gt;For the most part, ceramic artists tended to display their sculptures and not installations, whose avant garde roots were expressed by exposing the means of creation of the exhibition itself.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Siona Shimshi]], for example, developed her ceramic sculpture as a series of  archetypal human forms made of bare material.&lt;ref&gt;See: Siona Shimshi, "Anatomy of the Exhibition In Preparation for "Everybody is Sitting Down," in: Kaderut [Pottery], 10 (December 1984),  25-28; Siona Shimshi, Siona Shimshi: Preliminary Summary, 1987 (s.l: s.n., 1987). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nora and Naomi]] began to communicate with the sculptural field when they started to make use of motifs of journeys or nature images.  The works of [[Moshe Shek]] are somewhere on the spectrum between ceramics and sculpture, expressed in a sort of postmodern incarnation of the Israeli ceramic tradition.  The enormous pieces he created, which he called "containers" (1986), were decorated with simple designs that emphasized the natural colors of the material,&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Shak: Photographs, Ruti Ofek, ed. (Tefen: The Open Museum, Tefen and Omer Industrial Parks, 2006. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; and these sculptures displayed stylized imaginary animals made of clay cylinders that emanated echoes of  "Canaanite" sculpture.  Other artists, such as David Morris&lt;!--not mentioned on the dab page--&gt; and [[Mark Yudell]], used images specifically in order to create a private mythological world, which reflected their personal experiences, along with a dollop of humor and irony.

Another aspect of the preoccupation with the biographical can be seen in the infiltration of religious motifs into Israeli art in general, and into Israeli ceramic art in particular.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, "Flight from the Myth and Towards It," Towards a Godless Myth (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Artists House, 1985), 56. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie Balian]], for example, an Armenian artist, from the 1970s geared her art towards monumental wall paintings made of glazed tiles.&lt;ref&gt;These works had a great impact in the 1980s and 1990s, and 3 murals were even mounted on the walls of Beit HaNassi [President's Residence] in Jerusalem (1986).  At the same time traditional Armenian ceramics flourished because of the research activity of Nurit Canaan-Kedar.  In 1982, for example, the Eretz Israel Museum hosted the exhibition "Armenian Pottery of Jerusalem."&lt;/ref&gt;  Her images were drawn from the Armenian ceramic tradition, with changes that were expressed in the design of the composition, which was transformed into the fantastic.

A similar trend can be seen in the work of Jewish ceramicists, whose Judaica works were no stranger to their culture of the material.  [https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%A8_%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%94 Abraham and Pnina Gofer], for example, in the 1970s and 1980s displayed Seder plates made using casting molds, with images done in the ethnographic style, decorated with colorful glazes.  In contrast, Meira Una, in the mid-1980s created a series of Chanukah lamps that combined images from Orthodox Judaism with architectural images.  Her work is typified by the use of untreated material (without clay slips or glazes), with scribbles or engraved writing, and with no polishing or finishing of the form.  All of these works emphasized the status of the personal and the preoccupation with ars poetica in ceramics and art.

At the same time, the most prominent ceramic artist who made use of Jewish motifs came from the field of art and painting.  In the mid-1980s [[Moshe Gershuni]] began to create what became known as "Jewish ceramics."&lt;ref&gt;In his work "The Blood of My Heart (1980), Gershuni used plates dotted with paint stains, although during this period he made use of glass paint.&lt;/ref&gt; Gershuni made use of ready made plates that he bought second hand.  On these he drew with ceramic paints for low-fire pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Among the artists Gershuni helped were Lidia Zavatsky (according to Gershuni himself) and Daniel Davis (according to Davis's wife, Aviva Bar-On).&lt;/ref&gt; The images that appeared on his pottery combined excerpts from prayers, swastikas, and Magen Davids, which also can be seen in his paintings from these years.&lt;ref&gt;See: Moshe Gershuni, "Jewish Ceramics," in: Sarah Breitberg Semel, Gershuni (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2010), 314; Itamar Levy, Moshe Gershuni: Works, 1987-1990 (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1990), Plates 31-33, unnumbered. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibitions of these works in 1988 at Bezalel and in 1990 at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art generated wide publicity.

===Body, fragments, and slivers of identity===
Clear signs of the coming transition from pottery to ceramic sculpture could be seen during the second half of the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s.  A large number of ceramic artists began to adopt ideas from painting and sculpture in their art.  These ideas, in the eyes of these artists, conferred a new legitimacy on pottery and on the objects they created, both as an expression of their personal feelings and as an expression of ars poetica.

An example of the renewed relationship between sculpture and pottery can be seen in the works of artists on the border between traditional pottery and contemporary art.  [[Rayah Redlich]], for example, created large scale pots, which she presented as a renewed esthetic and cultural examination, and on which she used techniques of printing and painting "on the shards."  Many of these works were displayed on pedestals that were part of the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;See: Raya Redlich: Fallen Halos (Haifa: Haifa University, 2002), 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Daniel Davis]] used his potter's wheel to create large scale pots whose "shards" were then joined together in bundles by steel strips.  A group of about 70 of them appeared as part of "A Woman of the Pots," a performance and film created by his wife, [[Adina Bar-On]], in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;See: Alec Mishory, "Song of Praise to Mud," in: The way of Clay, 50 years of Israeli Ceramics (Ramat Gan: Ceramics Museum Aharon Kahana, 1998) (unnumbered pages).&lt;/ref&gt; Besides being used for musical percussion instruments, the pots pointed to themes like death and Judaism.  Another group that dealt with the imagery of the material and of pottery by means of a representative medium was the [[Zik Group]], whose works include a pot as a central image.  In the installation "Anarzik" (1997), for example, the group created, on the structure of a potter's wheel, a complex pot that underwent a transformation of its technology and its form before the eyes of the public.&lt;ref&gt;Einat Adi, "Anarzik," Studio 83, June (1987), 9-13. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prominent artist was [[Lidia Zavadsky]], who even served as the head of the Department of Ceramics and Glass Design at Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem.  Like other artists, Zavadsky inserted sculpture into her work as an integral part of her postmodern approach.  Between the years 1992-1994 Zavadsky produced a series of pot-sculptures that turned out to be the highlight of her artistic output.  The pots were monumental in size, glazed in intense colors, and a combination of work on the potter's wheel and sculpture.  In spite of her themes of corporeality and death, the form and the internal relationships were the central artistic concern of Zavadsky's work.  Through them the artist grappled with European and Asian pottery traditions. These works received more artistic recognition than any ceramic works up to that time and were displayed as well in the Israel Museum.

Only at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st did ceramic artists begin to make more consistent use of installation art within ceramic art.&lt;ref&gt;In connection with this, one should note the work of Gideon Gechtman from the mid-1990s on ceramics and on the relationship between the original and the copy.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists such as [[Talia Tokatly]], [[Hadass Rosenberg Nir]], [[Shlomit Bauman]], [[Yael Atzmony]], [[Maya Muchawsky Parnas]], and others created installations that combined different media, such as sculpture, ceramics, video, etc.  In their works we see a combining of elements of their personal identity through the disassembly and assembly of objects saturated with political or personal history.

An opposing philosophy to this sculptural trend was the return to the pottery tradition of which one expression was the increasing adoption of porcelain as the material used on potter's wheels and in casting beginning in the 1990s. This happened both because this material began to arrive in Israel on a regular basis, and because artists began to be trained in the use of this material within the academic framework&lt;ref&gt;Among the teachers was Stephan Agai, who taught porcelain casting at Bezalel in the 1990s (See: Shir Mellr-Yamaguchi and Anat Turbowicz, White Matter: Contemporary Porcelain Sculpture (Hazorea: Wilfrid Israel Museum, 2015), 5).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as privately.&lt;ref&gt;Among the artists who have trained potters in workshops in the use of porcelain from the beginning of the 20th century are Irit Abba and Rani Gilat.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the artists who began to use porcelain on potter's wheels was [[Irit Abba]]. The use of this material sharpened her concentration on the form of the pot and allowed her to develop a deconstructionist concept of the pot, of her perception of pottery, and of her view of European culture. She emphasized the materiality of the pots and jugs she produced in the early 2000s by using slotting and chinking on their surface, by combining the porcelain with "paper clay,"&lt;ref&gt;Material mixed with paper.  This material serves as a stabilizer in the making of pots and is characterized by more sculptural flexibility.&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian paste, and shavings, and by using intense colors.&lt;ref&gt;See Meira Yagid Haimovici, Irit Abba. The Wheel. Period. (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  In other artists as well, such as [[Esther Beck]] and [[Shulamit Teiblum-Millar]], we can see this renewed interest in pottery and in the materials of ceramics to emphasize the work processes used in the creation of artistic objects.

In spite of massive training in the technology of design, the disappearance of the ceramics industry in Israel pushed artists, and particularly designers, to the creation of individual objects or of objects in small series, and sometimes in large ones, using hand casting techniques.  The most prominent of these artists are designers such as [[Ami Derech]], [[Dov Ganchrow]], and [[Jonathan Hopp]].

'''Limbing''' (also known as "chasing") in [[logging]] is the process of removing [[branch]]es from the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] of a fallen [[tree]].  Options for cutting off the branches include [[chain saw]]s, [[harvester (forestry)|harvesters]], [[stroke delimbers]] and others.  Limbing can happen at the stump in log/tree length systems and [[Cut-to-length logging|cut-to-length]] systems or at the landing in whole-tree logging.

Different definitions for it include:
*One of the larger limbs of a tree.
*An extension or projecting part of a tree.

[[Image:Bucker1.jpg|thumb|right| Chainsaw limbing]]

When the tree is lying on the ground, branches may be storing enormous [[potential energy]] through mechanical [[Strain (materials science)|strain]]. When a branch is cut, often with a [[chain saw]], this energy can be released suddenly and the branch can jump dangerously. In addition, a branch may be supporting the tree, and the tree can fall or roll when the branch is cut. For these reasons, delimbing is a skilled operation requiring careful safety planning.

In [[British English]], limbing can be synonymous with [[snedding]]. Alternatively, limbing can be used to describe the operation on larger branches, and snedding on smaller.

[[Henry (vacuum)|Henry]] is a series of canister [[Vacuum cleaners|vacuums]] released in 1981 and made by [[Numatic International|Numatic]] most notable for their human-like, often considered cute faces on the body/head. They come in a variety of colors, names, sizes, and parts.

==Current main series vacuums==
[[File:Henry &amp; Hetty vacuum cleaners.jpg|thumb|A Henry HVR200 and Hetty HET200 during Christmas time]]
This is a list of current Henry models (currently being manufactured) in the main series, meaning they say "Henry" or another name on the cap and have a face on the body. Some models do not say a name and instead say "Numatic" on the cap, and even sometimes other words such as "Micro-filter." There are a total of 14 current main series Henry vacuums.&lt;ref&gt;https://numatic.co.uk/products.aspx?r=4&amp;sr=1&lt;/ref&gt; Some models have been out for numerous years, meaning many of these models' looks have been changed over time, but the parts, power, and bag size have stayed the same.

==Current secondary series vacuums==
This is a list of current Henry models (currently being manufactured) but instead of saying a name on the cap, say "Numatic." These vacuums are often very similar to main series Henry vacuums but opt to not say the name for more industrial reasons.

==Specialized engines/engine middle-ware==
{{Unsourced-section|date=January 2018}}
Some features may be integrated into engines. For instance for trees and foliage a special "engine" is available, [[SpeedTree]], that does just that (or could be integrated into general engines). The [[Euphoria (software)|Euphoria]] character's 3D animating engine can be used independently but is integrated in the [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]] and the game ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]''.

The '''Marsh funnel''' is a simple device for measuring [[viscosity]] by observing the time it takes a known volume of liquid to flow from a cone through a short tube.  It is standardized for use by [[mud engineer]]s to check the quality of [[drilling mud]].  Other cones with different geometries and orifice arrangements are called ''flow cones'', but have the same operating principle.

In use, the funnel is held vertically with the end of the tube closed by a finger.  The liquid to be measured is poured through the mesh to remove any particles which might block the tube.  When the fluid level reaches the mesh, the amount inside is equal to the rated volume.  To take the measurement, the finger is released as a stopclock is started, and the liquid is allowed to run into a measuring container.  The time in seconds is recorded as a measure of the viscosity.
[[File:Marsh funnel top view.jpg|thumb|right|Marsh Funnel top view showing the mesh through which drilling fluid is poured to retain particles which would not pass through the orifice.]]

==The Marsh Funnel==
Based on a method published in 1931 by H.N.Marsh,&lt;ref name=Marsh1931&gt;H. N. Marsh (1931)''Trans AIME'' vol 92 pp 234-251 "Properties and Treatment of Rotary Mud"&lt;/ref&gt; a Marsh cone is a flow cone with an [[aspect ratio]] of 2:1 and a working volume of at least a litre.  A Marsh funnel is a Marsh cone with a particular orifice and a working volume of 1.5 litres.  It consists of a cone 6 inches (152&amp;nbsp;mm) across and 12 inches in height (305&amp;nbsp;mm) to the apex of which is fixed a tube 2 inches (50.8&amp;nbsp;mm) long and 3/16 inch (4.76&amp;nbsp;mm) internal diameter.  A 10-mesh screen is fixed near the top across half the cone.&lt;ref name=API13B&gt;{{Citation |title=13B-1 Recommended Standard Procedure for Field Testing Water-Based Drilling Fluids |year=1990 | publication-place=Dallas |publisher=American Petroleum Institute |url=http://www.pngis.net/standards/6400/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American practice (and most of the [[oil industry]]) the volume collected is a quart.  If water is used, the time should be 26 +/- 0.5 seconds.&lt;ref name=API13B/&gt; If the time is less than this the tube is probably enlarged by erosion, if more it may be blocked or damaged, and the funnel should be replaced.  In some companies, and Europe in particular, the volume collected is a litre, for which the water funnel time should be 28 seconds.  Marsh himself collected 0.50 litre, for which the time was 18.5 seconds.&lt;ref name=Marsh1931/&gt;

The Marsh funnel time is often referred to as the Marsh funnel viscosity, and represented by the abbreviation FV.  The unit (seconds) is often omitted.  Formally, the volume should also be stated.
The (quart) Marsh funnel time for typical drilling muds is 34 to 50 seconds, though mud mixtures to cope with some geological conditions may have a time of 100 or more seconds.&lt;ref&gt;A. W. McCray &amp; F. W. Cole (1979) ''Oil Well Drilling Technology'' University of Oklahoma Press {{ISBN|0-8061-0423-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the most common use is for [[drilling mud]]s, which are [[non-Newtonian fluid]]s, the Marsh funnel is not a [[rheometer]], because it only provides one measurement under one flow condition.  However the effective viscosity can be determined from following simple formula.&lt;ref name=Pitt&gt;M. J. Pitt (2000) ''SPE Drilling and Completion'' vol 15 no1  pages 3-6 “The Marsh Funnel and Drilling Fluid Viscosity: A New Equation for Field Use”&lt;/ref&gt;

μ = ρ (t - 25)

where μ = effective viscosity in [[Poise (unit)|centipoise]]&lt;br /&gt; ρ = density in g/cm³&lt;br /&gt;t = quart funnel time in seconds

For example, a mud of funnel time 40 seconds and density 1.1 g/cm³ has an effective viscosity of about 16.5 cP.  For the range of times of typical muds above, the [[shear rate]] in the Marsh funnel is about 2000 &lt;sup&gt;−s&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

==Other Flow Cones==
The term '''Marsh cone''' is also used in the [[concrete]] and [[oil industry|oil industries]].  European standard EN445&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=BS EN445:1997 Grout for prestressing tendons - test methods |publisher=British Standards Institute |year=1997 |url=http://shop.bsigroup.com/en/SearchResults/?q=EN+445&amp;ib=1&amp;snc=Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; and American standard C939&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=ASTM C939-10 Standard Test Method for Flow of Grout |publisher=ASTM International |year=2010 |url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/C939.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; for measuring the flow properties of [[cement]] [[grout]] mixtures specify a funnel similar to the Marsh cone.  Some manufacturers supply devices which they call Marsh cones, with removable tubes with size ranges from 5 to 15&amp;nbsp;mm.  These can be used for quality control by selecting a tube which gives a convenient time, say 30 to 60 seconds.

'''Mary Engle Pennington''' (October 8, 1872 – December 27, 1952) was an American [[bacteriology|bacteriological]] chemist and refrigeration engineer.

==Early life and education==
Mary Engle Pennington was born in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; her parents were Henry and Sarah B. (Malony) Pennington. Shortly after her birth, her parents moved to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], to be closer to Sarah Pennington's [[Quaker]] relatives. Mary Pennington demonstrated an early interest in chemistry. She entered the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1890 and completed the requirements for a B.S. degree in chemistry with minors in botany and zoology in 1892. However, since the University of Pennsylvania did not grant degrees to women at this time, she was given a certificate of proficiency instead of a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Engle Pennington |work=JCE Online - Journal of Chemical Education |url=http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/JCEWWW/features/echemists/Bios/pennington.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021108191824/http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/JCEWWW/Features/eChemists/Bios/pennington.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-11-08 |accessdate=2011-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pennington received her Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1895, and was a university fellow in botany there in 1895–96. She was a fellow in physiological chemistry at [[Yale]] in 1897–99, where she did research in physiological chemistry with Mendel. In 1898, she accepted a position with the [[Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania]] as Director of their Clinical Laboratory. She also served as a  research worker in the department of hygiene at the University of Pennsylvania from 1898 to 1901, and was a bacteriologist with the Philadelphia Bureau of Health. In her position with the Bureau of Health, she was instrumental in improving sanitation standards for the handling of milk and milk products.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, Karl D., "Technologizing the Home: Mary Pennington and the Rise of Domestic Food Refrigeration." ''Proceedings, Women and Technology: Historical, Societal, and Professional Perspectives.'' IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society, New Brunswick, NJ, July 1999, 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association with the U.S. Department of Agriculture==
In 1905, Pennington began working for the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] as a bacteriological chemist. Her director at the Bureau of Chemistry, [[Harvey W. Wiley]], encouraged her to apply for a position as chief of the newly created Food Research Laboratory, which had been established to enforce the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] of 1906. She accepted the position in 1907. One of her major accomplishments was the development of standards for the safe processing of chickens raised for human consumption.  She also served as head of an investigation of refrigerated boxcar design, and served on [[Herbert Hoover]]'s War Food Administration during World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, 290&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Engle Pennington |work=JCE Online - Journal of Chemical Education |url=http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/JCEWWW/features/echemists/Bios/pennington.html |accessdate=2011-03-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021108191824/http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/JCEWWW/Features/eChemists/Bios/pennington.html |archivedate=2002-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refrigeration engineer and consultant==
Pennington's involvement with refrigerated boxcar design at the Food Research Laboratory led to an interest in the entire process of transporting and storing perishable food, including both refrigerated transport and home refrigeration. In 1919, Pennington accepted a position with a private firm, American Balsa, which manufactured insulation for refrigeration units.  She left the firm in 1922 to start her own consulting business, which she ran until her retirement in 1952. She founded the Household Refrigeration Bureau in 1923 to educate consumers in safe practices in domestic refrigeration. Much of her work in the 1920s was supported by the National Association of Ice Industries (NAII), an association of independent icemakers and distributors who delivered ice to the home for use in [[icebox]]es, before the widespread availability of electric refrigerators. With NAII support, she published pamphlets on home food safety, including ''The Care of the Child's Food in the Home'' (1925) and ''Cold is the Absence of Heat'' (1927).&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications and memberships==
She contributed to many scientific and medical journals and was a member of the [[American Chemical Society]] and the Society of Biological Chemists. She was a fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], and a member of the Philadelphia Pathological Society, [[Sigma XI]], and the [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]] Sorority.

==Awards==
Mary Engle Pennington was the recipient of the [[Garvan-Olin Medal]], the highest award given to women in the [[American Chemical Society]]. She is also an inductee of both the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] and the [[American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers|ASHRAE]] Hall of Fame. In 2018, she was inducted into the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.invent.org/inductees/mary-engle-pennington National Inventors Hall of Fame, Mary Engle Pennington]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1316">A '''mullion wall''' is a structural system in which the load of the floor slab is taken by prefabricated panels around the perimeter. Visually the effect is similar to the stone [[mullion]]ed windows of [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular Gothic]] or [[Elizabethan architecture]].

The technology was devised by [[George Grenfell Baines]] and the engineer [[Felix Samuely]] in order to cope with material shortages at the Thomas Linacre School, [[Wigan]] (1952) and refined at the [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] Offices, [[Stanlow Refinery|Stanlow]] (1956), the [[Derby]] Colleges of Technology and Art (1956–64).&lt;ref&gt;'''Architects’ Journal''' (1960), “Technical College”, ''Architects’ Journal'', (March 17) pp 441-448.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Manchester University]] Humanities Building (1961–67) &lt;ref&gt;'''Bill White'''  (1987), ''The Spirit Of BDP'', p 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar concept to the mullion wall was adopted by [[Eero Saarinen]] at the [[Embassy of the United States in London|US Embassy, London]] (1955–60) and by [[Minoru Yamasaki]] at [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], New York (1966–73).

The '''OSGi Alliance''', formerly known as the '''Open Services Gateway initiative''', is an [[open standard]]s organization founded in March 1999 that originally specified and continues to maintain the OSGi standard.

The '''OSGi specification''' describes a modular system and a [[Service (systems architecture)|service]] platform for the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language that implements a complete and dynamic [[component model]], something that does not exist in standalone Java/[[Virtual machine|VM]] environments. [[Application software|Applications]] or components, coming in the form of [[#Bundles|bundle]]s for [[software deployment|deployment]], can be remotely installed, started, stopped, updated, and uninstalled without requiring a [[Reboot (computer)|reboot]]; management of [[Java package]]s/[[class (computer science)|class]]es is specified in great detail. Application life cycle management is implemented via APIs that allow for remote [[downloading]] of management policies. The service registry allows bundles to detect the addition of new services, or the removal of services, and adapt accordingly.

The OSGi specifications have evolved beyond the original focus of service gateways, and are now used in applications ranging from [[mobile phone]]s to the open-source [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse IDE]]. Other application areas include [[automobile]]s, [[industrial automation]], [[building automation]], [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]]s, [[grid computing]], [[entertainment]], [[fleet management]] and [[application server]]s.

== Specification process ==
The OSGi specification is developed by the members in an open process and made available to the public free of charge under the OSGi Specification License.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osgi.org/Main/OSGiSpecificationLicense OSGi Specification License]&lt;/ref&gt; The OSGi Alliance has a [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] program that is open to members only. As of November 2010, there are seven certified OSGi framework [[implementation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.osgi.org/osgi-compliance/osgi-certification/osgi-certified-products/&lt;/ref&gt; A separate page lists both certified and non-certified [[OSGi Specification Implementations]], which include OSGi frameworks and other OSGi specifications.

== Architecture ==
[[File:Osgi framework.svg|thumb|250px|OSGi Service Gateway Architecture]]
OSGi is a Java framework for developing and deploying modular software programs and libraries. Each bundle is a tightly coupled, dynamically loadable collection of classes, jars, and configuration files that explicitly declare their external dependencies (if any).

The framework is conceptually divided into the following areas:
;Bundles:Bundles are normal [[JAR (file format)|JAR]] components with extra manifest headers.
;Services:The services layer connects bundles in a dynamic way by offering a publish-find-bind model for plain old Java interfaces ([[POJI]]s) or [[plain old Java object]]s (POJOs).
;Services Registry:The [[application programming interface]] for management services ([http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v41/org/osgi/framework/ServiceRegistration.html ServiceRegistration], [http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v41/org/osgi/util/tracker/ServiceTracker.html ServiceTracker] and [http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v41/org/osgi/framework/ServiceReference.html ServiceReference]).
;Life-Cycle:The [[application programming interface]] for life cycle management (install, start, stop, update, and uninstall) for bundles.
;Modules:The layer that defines encapsulation and declaration of dependencies (how a bundle can import and export code).
;Security:The layer that handles the security aspects by limiting bundle functionality to pre-defined capabilities.
;Execution Environment:Defines what methods and classes are available in a specific platform. There is no fixed list of execution environments, since it is subject to change as the [[Java Community Process]] creates new versions and editions of Java. However, the following set is currently supported by most OSGi implementations:
:*[[Connected Device Configuration|CDC-1.0/Foundation-1.0]]
:*[[Connected Device Configuration|CDC-1.1/Foundation-1.1]]
:*OSGi/Minimum-1.0
:*OSGi/Minimum-1.1
:*JRE-1.1
:*From J2SE-1.2 up to J2SE-1.6

==Bundles==
[[Image:osgi-system-layering.svg|thumb|Right|250px|Classification: OSGi]]

A bundle is a group of Java classes and additional resources equipped with a detailed manifest &lt;code&gt;[[MANIFEST.MF]]&lt;/code&gt; file on all its contents, as well as additional services needed to give the included group of Java classes more sophisticated behaviors, to the extent of deeming the entire aggregate a component.

Below is an example of a typical &lt;code&gt;[[MANIFEST.MF]]&lt;/code&gt; file with OSGi Headers:
&lt;source lang="properties" line&gt;
 Bundle-Name: Hello World
 Bundle-SymbolicName: org.wikipedia.helloworld
 Bundle-Description: A Hello World bundle

== Life-cycle ==
[[Image:OSGi Bundle Life-Cycle.svg|thumb|Right|250px|OSGi Bundle Life-Cycle]]
A Life Cycle layer adds bundles that can be dynamically installed, started, stopped, updated and uninstalled. Bundles rely on the module layer for class loading but add an API to manage the modules in run time. The life cycle layer introduces dynamics that are normally not part of an application. Extensive dependency mechanisms are used to assure the correct operation of the environment. Life cycle operations are fully protected with the security architecture.

{| class="wikitable"
! Bundle State
! Description
|-
| '''INSTALLED'''
| The bundle has been successfully installed.
|-
| '''RESOLVED'''
| All Java classes that the bundle needs are available. This state indicates that the bundle is either ready to be started or has stopped.
|-
| '''STARTING'''
| The bundle is being started, the &lt;code&gt;[http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v41/org/osgi/framework/BundleActivator.html#start(org.osgi.framework.BundleContext) BundleActivator.start]&lt;/code&gt; method has been called but the start method has not yet returned. When the bundle has an activation policy, the bundle will remain in the STARTING state until the bundle is activated according to its activation policy.
|-
| '''ACTIVE'''
| The bundle has been successfully activated and is running; its Bundle Activator start method has been called and returned.
|-
| '''STOPPING'''
| The bundle is being stopped. The &lt;code&gt;[http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v41/org/osgi/framework/BundleActivator.html#stop(org.osgi.framework.BundleContext) BundleActivator.stop]&lt;/code&gt; method has been called but the stop method has not yet returned.
|-
| '''UNINSTALLED'''
| The bundle has been uninstalled. It cannot move into another state.
|}
Below is an example of a typical Java class implementing the &lt;code&gt;[http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/framework/BundleActivator.html BundleActivator]&lt;/code&gt; interface:
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
package org.wikipedia;

import org.osgi.framework.BundleActivator;
import org.osgi.framework.BundleContext;

public class Activator implements BundleActivator {
	private BundleContext context;

	@Override
	public void start(BundleContext context) throws Exception {
		System.out.println("Starting: Hello World");
		this.context = context;
	}

	@Override
	public void stop(BundleContext context) throws Exception {
		System.out.println("Stopping: Goodbye Cruel World");
		this.context = null;
	}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Services==
{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}

===Standard services===
The OSGi Alliance has specified many services. Services are specified by a [[Java interface]]. Bundles can implement this interface and register the service with the Service Registry. Clients of the service can find it in the registry, or react to it when it appears or disappears.

The table below shows a description of OSGi System Services:
{| class="wikitable" width = "100%"
! System Services
! Description
|-dsafassafasfas
| '''Logging'''
| The [[Java logging framework|logging]] of information, warnings, debug information or errors is handled through the Log Service. It receives log entries and then dispatches these entries to other bundles that subscribed to this information.
|-
| '''Configuration Admin'''
| This service allows an operator to set and get the configuration information of deployed bundles
|-
| '''Device Access'''
| Facilitates the coordination of automatic detection and attachment of existing devices. This is used for Plug and Play scenarios.
|-
| '''User Admin'''
| This service uses a database with user information (private and public) for authentication and authorization purposes.
|-
| '''IO Connector'''
| The IO Connector Service implements the [[Connected Device Configuration|CDC]]/[[CLDC]] &lt;code&gt;[http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis/jsr118/javax/microedition/io/package-summary.html javax.microedition.io]&lt;/code&gt; package as a service. This service allows bundles to provide new and alternative protocol schemes.
|-
| '''Preferences'''
| Offers an alternative, more OSGi-friendly mechanism to using Java’s default {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|Properties}} for storing preferences.
|-
| '''Component Runtime'''
| The dynamic nature of services—they can come and go at any time—makes writing software harder. The Component Runtime specification can simplify handling these dynamic aspects by providing an XML based declaration of the dependencies.
|-
| '''Deployment Admin'''
| Standardizes access to some of the responsibilities of the management agent.
|-
| '''Event Admin'''
| Provides an inter-bundle communication mechanism based on a publish-and-subscribe model.
|-
| '''Application Admin'''
| Simplifies the management of an environment with many different types of applications that are simultaneously available.
|}
The table below shows a description of OSGi Protocol Services:
{| class="wikitable" width = "100%"
! Protocol Services
! Description
|-
| '''HTTP Service'''
| Allows information to be sent and received from OSGi using [[HTTP]].
|-
| '''UPnP Device Service'''
| Specifies how OSGi bundles can be developed to interoperate with [[Universal Plug and Play]] (UPnP) devices.
|-
| '''DMT Admin'''
| Defines an API for managing a device using concepts from the [[Open Mobile Alliance]] (OMA) device management specifications.
|}
The table below shows a description of OSGi Miscellaneous Services:
{| class="wikitable" width = "100%"
! Miscellaneous Services
! Description
|-
| '''Wire Admin'''
| Allows the connection between a Producer service and a Consumer service.
|-
| '''XML Parser'''
| The XML Parser service allows a bundle to locate a parser with desired properties and compatibility with [[JAXP]].
|-
| '''Measurement and State'''
| The Measurement and State service allows and simplifies the correct handling of measurements in an OSGi service platform.
|}

== Organization ==
The OSGi Alliance was founded by [[Ericsson]], [[International Business Machines|IBM]], [[Motorola]], [[Sun Microsystems]] and others in March 1999. Before incorporating as a nonprofit corporation, it was called the Connected Alliance.

Among its members are ({{As of|2015|alt=as of February 2015}}) more than 35 companies from quite different business areas, for example [[Adobe Systems]], [[Deutsche Telekom]], [[Hitachi]], [[International Business Machines|IBM]], [[Liferay]], [http://www.makewave.com Makewave (formerly Gatespace Telematics)], [[NEC]], [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Orange S.A.]], [[ProSyst]], [[Salesforce.com]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[Software AG]] and [[TIBCO Software]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osgi.org/About/Members OSGi Alliance | About / Members]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alliance has a board of directors that provides the organization's overall governance.  OSGi officers have various roles and responsibilities in supporting the alliance. Technical work is conducted within Expert Groups (EGs) chartered by the board of directors, and non-technical work is conducted in various working groups and committees. The technical work conducted within Expert Groups include developing specifications, reference implementations, and compliance tests. These Expert Groups have produced five major releases of the OSGi specifications ({{as of|2012}}).

Dedicated Expert Groups exist for the enterprise, mobile, vehicle and the core platform areas.

The Enterprise Expert Group (EEG) is the newest EG and is addressing Enterprise / Server-side applications.
In November 2007 the Residential Expert Group (REG) started to work on specifications to remotely manage residential/home-gateways.
In October 2003, [[Nokia]], [[Motorola]], [[International Business Machines|IBM]], [[ProSyst]] and other OSGi members formed a Mobile Expert Group (MEG) that will specify a [[MIDP]]-based service platform for the next generation of smart mobile phones, addressing some of the needs that [[Connected Limited Device Configuration|CLDC]] cannot manage - other than [[Connected Device Configuration|CDC]]. MEG became part of OSGi as with R4.

[[File:Abandoned gas well pump.jpg|thumb|Abandoned gas well pump]]

Though different jurisdictions have varying criteria for what exactly qualifies as an abandoned oil well, generally speaking an [[oil well]] is considered abandoned when it has been permanently taken out of production. Similarly, orphaned wells may have different legal definitions across different jurisdictions, but can be thought of as wells whose legal owner it is not possible to determine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Austin L.|last2=Casman|first2=Elizabeth A.|date=2011-11-15|title=Economic Incentives and Regulatory Framework for Shale Gas Well Site Reclamation in Pennsylvania|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es2021796|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=45|issue=22|pages=9506–9514|doi=10.1021/es2021796|issn=0013-936X}}&lt;/ref&gt; State legislatures in the United States have specific definitions based on local needs and priorities. For example, the section on abandoned wells in [[Texas]]' Natural Resource Code defines an "inactive well" as "an unplugged well that has had no reported production, disposal, injection, or other permitted activity for a period of greater than 12 months."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/NR/htm/NR.89.htm|title=NATURAL RESOURCES CODE  CHAPTER 89. ABANDONED WELLS|website=www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pennsylvania]]'s definition of abandoned well includes not producing for 12 months, "considered dry and not equipped for production within 60 days after [[drilling]], redrilling or deepening, and from which the equipment needed to extract resources or produce energy has been removed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/58/00.032..HTM|title=Chapter 32 - Title 58 - OIL AND GAS|website=www.legis.state.pa.us|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ohio]] legislation defines "idle and orphaned wells" based on whether or not a well bond has been forfeited or the money to plug it is unavailable. It defines a "temporary inactive well status" as not having produced for two (non-horizontal wells) or eight (horizontal wells) statutorily defined reporting periods or one that has produced "less than 100,000 cubic feet of natural gas or 15 barrels of crude oil."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/1509.062|title=Lawriter - ORC - 1509.062 Temporary inactive well status.|website=codes.ohio.gov|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental impacts of orphaned and abandoned wells ==
Orphaned and abandoned wells can cause [[environmental damage]] by [[Oil spill|leaking pollutants]] into the atmosphere or water supplies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rff.org/files/document/file/RFF-Rpt-PluggingInactiveWells.pdf|title=Plugging the Gaps in Inactive Well Policy|last=Resources for the Future|first=|date=May 2016|website=www.rff.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important determinants of how much orphaned and abandoned wells impact the environment include the techniques used and precautions taken when first drilling the well, whether it is a [[gas well]], [[oil well]], or combined oil and gas well, and if and how the well was [[Seal (mechanical)|sealed]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

If wells are not properly sealed when orphaned or abandoned, there can allow oil and gas to contaminate [[groundwater]]. It is also possible for orphaned and abandoned wells to be significant emitters of [[methane]] into the [[Atmospheric methane|atmosphere]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kang|first=Mary|last2=Christian|first2=Shanna|last3=Celia|first3=Michael A.|last4=Mauzerall|first4=Denise L.|last5=Bill|first5=Markus|last6=Miller|first6=Alana R.|last7=Chen|first7=Yuheng|last8=Conrad|first8=Mark E.|last9=Darrah|first9=Thomas H.|date=2016-11-29|title=Identification and characterization of high methane-emitting abandoned oil and gas wells|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/113/48/13636|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=113|issue=48|pages=13636–13641|doi=10.1073/pnas.1605913113|issn=0027-8424|pmc=5137730|pmid=27849603}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, brine present in wells dug into shale formations can contain some radioactive and toxic substances that contaminate groundwater if the well leaks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Plugging wells can reduce the risk of explosions and protect groundwater, but does not always prevent methane emissions.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The costs to mitigate the impact of orphaned and abandoned wells varies, but may include removing all equipment from the site, restoring the land and topsoil, and planting local species, in addition to plugging the well itself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, plugging a well and restoring the surrounding land costs an average of $100,000 for wells in the [[Marcellus Shale]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One problem with studying the impacts of orphaned and abandoned wells is that data about them can be scarce and incomplete. In the United States, it is possible for wells to have been orphaned or abandoned for over a century, and information about them, if it exists at all, can be difficult to find.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Responses ==
One way to encourage well owners not to abandon or orphan wells and to make sure wells are safely abandoned is to use well bonds. These are bonds paid by well operators to a surety company and are held by an obligee (state or federal entity) until the well has been satisfactorily plugged and the land surface restored. A significant challenge of making well bonds an effective policy tool is to set their price to a point that does not make market entry prohibitively expensive, but also does not incentivize well operators to forfeit the bond instead of undertaking the abandonment requirements specified in local law.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another way to encourage well owners not to abandon or orphan wells is to retrofit oil and gas wells to produce [[geothermal energy]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bu|first=Xianbiao|last2=Ma|first2=Weibin|last3=Li|first3=Huashan|date=2012-05-01|title=Geothermal energy production utilizing abandoned oil and gas wells|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096014811100574X|journal=Renewable Energy|volume=41|pages=80–85|doi=10.1016/j.renene.2011.10.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One benefit of this approach is that it is less expensive to retrofit an abandoned well to produce geothermal energy than it is to drill a new oil or gas well.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It also saves the cost of exploring sites for geothermal fields.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pangea.stanford.edu/ERE/db/WGC/papers/WGC/2015/37008.pdf|title=From an Oilfield to a Geothermal One: Use of a Selection Matrix to Choose Between Two Extraction Technologies|last=Soldo|first=Elena|date=25 April 2015|website=https://pangea.stanford.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5/1/2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avoiding new exploration and drilling avoids the environmental impacts of these activities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, geothermal fluids can contain environmentally hazardous chemicals such as [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[ammonia]], methane, [[arsenic]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[lead]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A third option is to mandate that well operators establish reclamation trusts which would be used to pay reclamation costs if the operator does not perform the necessary plugging and land restoration within a given time period after abandoning the well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This policy option has been used to mitigate the [[environmental impact of mines]] in the United States as part of a combined command-and-control and market incentive policy response to environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cao|first=Xia|date=2007-04-01|title=Regulating mine land reclamation in developing countries: The case of China|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837706000718|journal=Land Use Policy|volume=24|issue=2|pages=472–483|doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2006.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; One risk attached to this policy option is that if wells become economically unproductive before the period planned for in the trust agreement, the abandoned well could become a liability held by the relevant government authority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''Polish Enigma "double"''' was a machine produced by the Polish [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]] that replicated the German [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] [[Rotor machine|rotor cipher]] machine.  The Enigma double was one result of [[Marian Rejewski]]'s remarkable achievement of determining the wiring of the Enigma's rotors and reflectors.&lt;ref&gt;Woytak, "A Conversation with Marian Rejewski," pp. 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First double==
[[File:Polish copy of Enigma made by Biuro Szyfrow.jpg|thumb|200px|Prewar Polish ''Enigma'' double]]
The Polish Cipher Bureau recognized that the Germans were using a new cipher. The Germans had mistakenly shipped a cipher machine to Poland; their attempts to recover a shipment raised the suspicions of Polish customs, and the Polish Cipher Bureau learned that the Germans were using an Enigma machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Marian |last=Rejewski |authorlink=Marian Rejewski |title=How Polish Mathematicians Deciphered the Enigma |publisher=IEEE |journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing |date=July 1981 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=213–234 |url=http://chc60.fgcu.edu/Images/articles/Rejewski.pdf |quote= |doi=10.1109/mahc.1981.10033}}, p. 213. says incident was end of 1927 or beginning of 1928.  Enigma traffic appeared 15 July 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Hugh |last=Sebag-Montefiore |title=Enigma: The Battle for the Code |publisher=John Wiley |year=2000 |isbn=0-471-40738-0 |page=21 |quote=On the last Saturday in January 1929 an alert customs officer working in Warsaw had been about to process a heavy box when his suspicions were aroused by a request from the German Embassy.  Apparently the box had been sent to Poland by mistake and a German Embassy official was requesting that it should be returned to Germany immediately.  When the box was opened, an Enigma machine was found inside. The Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau quickly called in two engineers to examine it. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AUnmwrKa1XcC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;f=false}}. This date is one year later than Rejewski's date. This reference also has the Polish Cipher Bureau receiving technical details of the Enigma from the French in December 1931 and September 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enigma, http://www.polandinexile.com/enigmaenglish.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Don E. |last=Gordon |title=Electronic Warfare: Element of Strategy and Multiplier of Combat Power |publisher=Pergamon |year=1981 |isbn=978-1483208824 |page=36 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yeJbAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bureau purchased a commercial Enigma machine, and it attempted but failed to break the cipher.

In December 1932, the Polish Cipher Bureau tasked [[Marian Rejewski]] with breaking the Enigma cipher machine.  A French spy had obtained some material about the Enigma, and the French had provided the material to the Polish Cipher Bureau.  By that time, the commercial Enigma had been extended to use a plugboard.  Rejewski made rapid progress and was able to determine the wiring of the military Enigma.  The Bureau modified its commercial Enigma rotors, reflector, and internal wiring to match the military Enigma.  The commercial Enigma did not have a plugboard, but the plugboard could be simulated by relabeling the keys and the lamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The result was the first Enigma double.

==AVA==
In February 1933, the Polish [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]] ordered fifteen "doubles" of the military [[Enigma machine]] from the AVA Radio Manufacturing Company, in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, about seventy such functional replicas were produced.

==Precious gift==
In August 1939, following the tripartite meeting of the French, British and Polish cryptanalysts held near Warsaw on 25 and 26 July, two Enigma replicas were passed to Poland's allies, one being sent to Paris and one to London.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, German military Enigma traffic had defeated the British and French, and they had faced the disturbing prospect that German communications would remain "black" to them for the duration of the coming war.

==Built in France==
[[File:Polish Enigma double.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the four machines assembled in France in 1940, featuring the characteristic ''ABCD'' keyboard layout.  Now in the [[Józef Piłsudski Institute in London]].]]
After [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Germany invaded Poland]] in September 1939 and key Polish [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]] personnel had been evacuated to [[France]], the Cipher Bureau resumed its interrupted work at ''[[PC Bruno]]'', outside [[Paris]].  The Poles had only three replica Enigma machines to work with,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=83}}. Two secretly taken out of Poland during the evacuation, and the one that had been sent to France after the July Warsaw conference.&lt;/ref&gt; and these were wearing out from round-the-clock use.  [[French Army]] [[intelligence officer]] [[Gustave Bertrand]] ordered parts for forty machines from a French precision-mechanics firm.  Manufacture proceeded sluggishly, however, and it was only after the fall of France and the opening of underground work in southern France's [[Zone libre|Free Zone]] in October 1940 that four machines were finally assembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roaming''' is a [[wireless]] [[telecommunication]] term typically used with mobile devices (like mobile phones). It refers to the mobile phone being used outside the range of its home network and connects to another available cell network.

== Technical definition ==
In more technical terms, roaming refers to ''the ability for a [[cellular network|cellular]] customer to automatically make and receive voice calls, send and receive data, or access other services, including home data services, when travelling outside the geographical coverage area of the home [[Telecommunications network|network]], by means of using a visited network''. For example: should a subscriber travel beyond their cell phone company's transmitter range, their cell phone would automatically hop onto another phone company's service, if available.

The process is supported by the Telecommunication processes of mobility management, [[authentication]], [[authorization]] and [[accounting]] [[Bill (payment)|billing]] procedures (known as AAA or 'triple A').

== Roaming in general ==
[[File:T-Mobile roaming welcome message - Redvers.jpg|thumb|An [[SMS]] welcome to [[Proximus]] ([[Belgium]]) customers who have roamed onto [[T-Mobile UK|T-Mobile]] in the UK]]

Roaming is divided into "SIM-based roaming" and "username/password-based roaming", whereby the technical term "roaming" also encompasses roaming between networks of different network standards, e.g. [[Wireless LAN|WLAN (wireless local area network)]] or GSM. Device equipment and functionality, such as [[Subscriber identity module|SIM card]] capability, [[Radio antenna|antenna]] and [[Computer interface|network interfaces]], and [[power management]], determine the access possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=IEEE|title=5th IEEE International Conference on High Speed Networks and Multimedia Communications, HSNMC 2002 : July 3 - 5, 2002, Jeju Island, Korea|date=2002|publisher=IEEE Operations Center|location=Piscataway, NJ|isbn=0-7803-7600-5|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HSNMC.2002.1032607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the example of WLAN/GSM roaming, the following scenarios can be differentiated (cf. GSM Association Permanent Reference Document AA.39):
* SIM-based (roaming): GSM subscriber roams onto a public WLAN operated by:
** their GSM operator, or
** another operator who has a roaming agreement with their GSM operator.
* Username/password based roaming: GSM subscriber roams onto a public WLAN operated by:
** their GSM operator, or
** another operator who has a roaming agreement with their GSM operator.

Although these user/network scenarios focus on roaming from GSM network operator's networks, clearly roaming can be bi-directional, i.e. from public WLAN operators to GSM networks. Traditional roaming in networks of the same standard, e.g. from a WLAN to a WLAN or a GSM network to a GSM network, has already been described above and is likewise defined by the foreignness of the network based on the type of subscriber entry in the home subscriber register.

In the case of session continuity, seamless access to these services across different access types is provided.

== Home and visited networks ==
{{Main|Network switching subsystem#Home location register|l1=Home location register|Network switching subsystem#Visitor location register|l2=Visitor location register}}
"Home network" refers to the network the subscriber is registered with. 

"Visitor network" refers to the network a subscriber roams temporarily and is outside the bounds of the "home network".

== Roaming agreements ==

The legal roaming business aspects negotiated between the roaming partners for billing of the services obtained are usually stipulated in so called ''roaming agreements.'' The GSM Association broadly outlines the content of such roaming agreements in standardized form for its members. For the legal aspects of authentication, authorization and billing of the visiting subscriber, the roaming agreements typically can comprise minimal safety standards, as e.g. [[Periodic location update|location update procedures]] or financial security or warranty procedures.

== The roaming process ==
The details of the roaming process differ among types of cellular networks, but in general, the process resembles the following:

=== Location update ===
Location updating is the mechanism that is used to determine the location of an [[Mobile station|MS]] in the idle state (connected to the network, but with no active call).
# When the mobile device is turned on or is transferred via a [[handoff|handover]] to the network, this new "visited" network sees the device, notices that it is not registered with its own system, and attempts to identify its home network. If there is no roaming agreement between the two networks, maintenance of service is impossible, and service is denied by the visited network.
# The visited network contacts the home network and requests service information (including whether or not the mobile should be allowed to roam) about the roaming device using the [[International mobile subscriber identity|IMSI]] number.
# If successful, the visited network begins to maintain a temporary subscriber record for the device. Likewise, the home network updates its information to indicate that the cell phone is on the visited network so that any information sent to that device can be correctly routed.

=== Mobile terminated call ===
It occurs for example when a call is made to a roaming cell phone.

Signaling process:
# The calling subscriber (from within the [[PSTN|public telephone network]]) dials the mobile subscriber's [[MSISDN]] (the telephone number) of the roaming cell phone.
# Based on the information contained in the MSISDN (national destination code and the country code), the call is routed to the [[Network switching subsystem|mobile network gateway MSC (GMSC)]]. It's done with an [[ISDN User Part|ISUP]] IAM message.
# To locate the [[Mobile station|MS]], the GMSC sends to the HLR a [[Mobile Application Part|MAP]] SRI (Send Routing Information) message. The MAP SRI message contains the MSISDN number and with this MSISDN the HLR will obtain the [[International mobile subscriber identity|IMSI]].
# Because of past location updates, the HLR already knows the VLR that currently serves the subscriber. The HLR will send to the VLR a [[Mobile Application Part|MAP]] PRN (Provide Roaming Number) message to obtain the [[Mobile Station Roaming Number|MSRN]] of the roaming cell phone. Like that the HLR will be able to route the call to the correct MSC.
# With the IMSI contained in the MAP PRN message, the VLR assigns a temporary number known as the [[Mobile Station Roaming Number|mobile station roaming number (MSRN)]] to the roaming cell phone. This MSRN number is sent back to the HLR in a MAP RIA (Routing Information Acknowledgement) message.
# Now with the MSRN number, the [[Network switching subsystem|GMSC]] knows how to route the call to reach the roaming cell phone. Then, the call is made using ISUP (or TUP) signaling between the GMSC and the visited MSC. The GMSC will generate an [[ISDN User Part|ISUP]] IAM message with the [[Mobile Station Roaming Number|MSRN]] as the called party number (and NOT the MSISDN as the called party number).
# When the MSC of the visitor network receives the IAM, it recognizes the MSRN and knows the IMSI for which the MSRN was allocated. The MSC then returns the MSRN to the pool for future use on another call. Afterwards, the MSC sends to the VLR a [[Mobile Application Part|MAP]] SI (Send Information) message to request information like the called MS's capabilities, services subscribed to, and so on. If the called MS is authorized and capable of taking the call, the VLR sends a MAP CC (Complete Call) message back to the MSC.

In order that a subscriber is able to register on to a visited network, a roaming agreement needs to be in place between the visited network and the home network. This agreement is established after a series of testing processes called IREG (International Roaming Expert Group) and [[Transferred Account Data Interchange Group|TADIG]] (Transferred Account Data Interchange Group). While the IREG testing is to test the proper functioning of the established communication links, the TADIG testing is to check the billability of the calls.

The usage by a subscriber in a visited network is captured in a file called the TAP (Transferred Account Procedure) for GSM / CIBER (Cellular Intercarrier Billing Exchange Record) for CDMA, AMPS etc... file and is transferred to the home network. A TAP/CIBER file contains details of the calls made by the subscriber viz. location, calling party, called party, time of call and duration, etc. The TAP/CIBER files are rated as per the tariffs charged by the visited operator. The home operator then bills these calls to its subscribers and may charge a mark-up/tax applicable locally.
As recently many carriers launched own retail rate plans and bundles for Roaming, TAP records are generally used for wholesale Inter-Operators settlements only

== Tariffs ==

Roaming fees are charged on a per-minute basis for wireless voice service, per [[text message]] and per [[megabyte per second]]{{fact|date=November 2018}} for data service, and they are typically determined by the service provider's pricing plan.

Several carriers in both the United States and India have eliminated these fees in their nationwide pricing plans. All of the major carriers{{fact|date=November 2018}} now offer pricing plans that allow consumers to purchase nationwide roaming-free minutes. However, carriers define "nationwide" in different ways. For example, some carriers define "nationwide" as anywhere in the U.S., whereas others define it as anywhere within the carrier's network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reduce international roaming by up to 85%|url=https://www.worldsim.com/international-roaming-tariffs|publisher=worldsim.com|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the main network providers generally send text alerts to advise users that they will now be charged international rates so it is clear when this will apply. UK data roaming charges abroad vary depending on the nature of the phone agreement (either [[Prepaid mobile phone|pay as you go]] or [[Postpaid mobile phone|monthly contracts]]). Some carriers, including [[T-Mobile]] and [[Virgin Mobile]], do not allow pay as you go customers to use international roaming without pre-purchase of an international "add on" or "bolt on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Winstone|first=Liz |url=http://www.aph.com/community/know-before-you-go/aph-compares-data-roaming-charges-of-all-uk-mobile-networks/ |title=APH Compares Data Roaming Charges of all UK mobile networks |publisher=Airport Parking and Hotels |date=2014-09-09 |accessdate=2014-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An operator intending to provide roaming services to visitors publishes the tariffs that would be charged in their network at least sixty days prior to its implementation under normal situations. The visited operator tariffs may include tax, discounts etc. and would be based on duration in case of voice calls. For data calls, the charging may be based on the data volume sent and received. Some operators also charge a separate fee for call setup i.e. for the establishment of a call. This charge is called a ''[[flagfall]]'' charge.

=== Roaming between European countries ===
{{main article|European Commission roaming regulations}}
In the [[European Union]], the regulation on roaming charges has been in force since 30 June 2007, forcing service providers to lower their roaming fees across the 28-member bloc. It later also included [[European Economic Area|EEA]] member states. The regulation sets a price cap of €0.39 (€0.49 in 2007, €0.46 in 2008, €0.43 in 2009) per minute for outgoing calls, and  €0.15 (€0.24 in 2007, €0.22 in 2008, €0.19 in 2009) per minute for incoming calls - excluding tax.&lt;ref name="test1"&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/en/infosociety/new-caps-roaming-charges-place-august/article-164430 "New caps on roaming charges in place for August"], 8 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; If the [[European Commission|Commission]] is satisfied that competition will continue to keep prices at this level, or lower, the regulation will expire in mid-2012. Since mid-2009 there is also an €0.11 (excluding tax) maximum price for SMS text message included into this regulation.

On 11 June 2013, the European Commission voted to end mobile roaming charges. It is expected to come into force on 1 July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Christopher |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/telecoms/10119159/EU-to-end-mobile-roaming-charges-next-year.html |title=EU to end mobile roaming charges next year |publisher=The Telegraph |date=2013-06-13 |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If everything goes according to the plan, as of December 15, 2015, there will be no roaming charges within the European Union. While the European Commission (EC) believes that ending roaming charges will stimulate entrepreneurship and trade, mobile operators have their doubts about the changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mináriková|first=Katarína  |url=http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/53924/20/roaming_charges_to_drop_end.html |title=Roaming charges to drop, end |publisher=The Slovak Spectator |date=2014-05-12 |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is a list of operators that started to renounce roaming charges before 15 December 2015:

On 15 June 2017 a bill dubbed "Roam like at Home" signed by the European Parliament and Commission earlier in May of the same year came into force that abolished all roaming charges within the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.&lt;ref name="test2"&gt;[https://www.rt.com/business/386091-eu-abolish-mobile-roaming-charges/ "EU scraps mobile roaming charges within bloc"], 25 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roaming between other countries ===
Countries that do not share a supra-national authority have also begun examining the provision of international roaming services. In April 2011, Singapore and Malaysia announced that they had agreed with operators to reduce voice and SMS rates for roaming between their two countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ida.gov.sg/News%20and%20Events/20110316121622.aspx?getPagetype=20 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607143255/http://www.ida.gov.sg/News%20and%20Events/20110316121622.aspx?getPagetype=20 |date=June 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Australia and New Zealand published a draft report proposing coordinated action on roaming services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.govt.nz/sectors-industries/technology-communication/pdf-docs-library/communications/mobile-phones/trans-tasman-roaming/TTR%20Draft%20Report.pdf |title=Trans-Tasman Roaming - Draft Report |publisher=Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a final report in February 2013 recommending that the two countries equip their telecommunications regulators with an extended palette of regulatory remedies, when they investigate international roaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.govt.nz/sectors-industries/technology-communication/communications/mobile-phones/trans-tasman-roaming|title=Trans-Tasman roaming|work=med.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian and New Zealand prime ministers subsequently announced that they would introduce legislation to effect the recommendations of the final report.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pm.gov.au/press-office/joint-statement-prime-ministers-key-and-gillard-february-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other types of roaming ==
[[File:Roaming symbol Android.png|thumbnail|Roaming sign shown in notification bar on an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] powered [[smartphone]].]]

===Regional or internal roaming===
This type refers to the ability of moving from one region to another region inside national coverage of the mobile operator ("internal roaming"). Initially, operators may have provided commercial offers restricted to a region (sometimes to a town). Due to the success of GSM and the decrease in cost, regional roaming is rarely offered to clients except in nations with wide geographic areas like the USA, Russia, India, etc., in which there are a number of regional operators.

In Russia even country-wide operators charge different tariffs depending on whether the users are within or outside of their "home region". A number of legislative attempts to remove the "internal roaming" failed due to opposition from operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tvrain.ru/news/rouming-474243/|title=В правительстве отказались от полной отмены платы за национальный роуминг|last=Inc.|first=TV Rain,|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the annexation of Crimea in 2014 the Russian operators are facing significant criticism as they do not offer their services inside Crimea directly, even though formally it's recognized as a regular federal subject inside Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://krymsos.com/en/news/cherez-sanktsiyi-v-krimu-ne-bude-velikikh-operatoriv-zvyazku-rf/|title=Crimea will not have large telecom operators of Russian Federation because of sanctions|work=CrimeaSOS|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National roaming===
This type refers to the ability to move from one mobile operator to another in the same country. For example, a subscriber of [[T-Mobile USA]] who is allowed to roam on [[AT&amp;T Mobility]]'s service would have national roaming rights.
For commercial and license reasons, this type of roaming is not allowed unless under very specific circumstances and under regulatory scrutiny. This has often taken place when a new company is assigned a mobile telephony license, to create a more competitive market by allowing the new entrant to offer coverage comparable to that of established operators (by requiring the existing operators to allow roaming while the new entrant has time to build up its own network).

In a country like India, where the number of regional operators is high and the country is divided into ''[[telecom circle]]s,'' this type of roaming is common. Following the launch of the [https://pebblenetwork.ltd.uk Pebble Network] in the UK on 15 July 2015, national roaming has been possible across the major UK networks at no additional cost using a Pebble Network SIM card.

===International roaming===
This type of roaming refers to the ability to move to a foreign service provider's network. It is, consequently, of particular interest to international tourists and business travellers. Broadly speaking, international roaming is easiest{{according to whom|date=October 2017}} using the GSM standard, as it is used by over 80% of the world's mobile operators. However, even then, there may be problems, since countries have allocated different frequency bands for GSM communications (there are two groups of countries: most GSM countries use 900/1800&amp;nbsp;MHz, but the [[United States]] and some other countries in the Americas have allocated 850/1900&amp;nbsp;MHz): for a phone to work in a country with a different frequency allocation, it must support one or both of that country's frequencies, and thus be [[Tri band|tri]] or [[quad band]]. If international roaming allows the traveller to stay connected during their trip, it can also generate significant costs for users. In fact, the use of mobile networks outside its original country can lead to significant billing by its original mobile data operator&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/advice/How-to-avoid-data-roaming-charges/|title=How to avoid data roaming charges|last=Porter|first=Lizzie|date=2016-02-04|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Inter-standards roaming===
This type refers to roaming between two standards. This term is now widely used in mobile communications where especially [[CDMA]] customers want to use their phone in areas where there is no CDMA network or there is no roaming agreement in place to support roaming on the used standard. In Europe there are hardly any CDMA networks. Most CDMA customers originate from the Americas or the Far East. In order to enable them to roam in Europe inter-standard roaming is the solution. The CDMA customers arriving in Europe can register on the available [[GSM]] networks.

Since mobile communication technologies have evolved independently across continents, there is significant challenge in achieving seamless roaming across these technologies. Typically, these technologies were implemented in accordance with technological standards laid down by different industry bodies and hence the name. A number of the standards making industry bodies have come together to define and achieve interoperability between the technologies as a means to achieve inter-standards roaming. This is currently an ongoing effort.

===Mobile Signature Roaming===
{{Main|Mobile Signature Roaming}}
''Mobile signature Roaming'' allows an [[Wireless access point|access point]] to get a [[Mobile Signature]] from any end-user, even if the AP and the end-user have not contracted a commercial relationship with the same [[Service Switching Point|MSSP]]. Otherwise, an AP would have to build commercial terms with as many MSSPs as possible, and this might be a cost burden. This means that a Mobile Signature transaction issued by an Application Provider should be able to reach the appropriate MSSP, and this should be transparent for the AP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.etsi.org/docbox/EC_Files/EC_Files/ts_102207v010103p.pdf|title=Restricted Access|work=etsi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter MSC Roaming===
Network elements belonging to the same Operator but located in different areas (a typical situation where assignment of local licenses is a common practice) pair depends on the switch and its location. Hence, software changes and a greater processing capability are required, but furthermore this situation could introduce the fairly new concept of roaming on a per MSC basis instead of per Operator basis. But this is actually a burden, so it is avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=686490 |title=Signalling interoperability as a key enabler to GSM/PCS roaming with North America |doi=10.1109/VETEC.1998.686490 |publisher=IEEE Xplore |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Permanent roaming===
This type refers to customers who purchase service with a [[mobile phone operator]] intending to permanently roaming, or be off-network. This becomes possible because of the increasing popularity and availability of "free roaming" service plan, where there is no cost difference between on and off network usage. The benefits of getting service from a mobile phone operator that is not local to a user can include cheaper rates, or features and phones that are not available on their local mobile phone operator, or to get to a particular mobile phone operator's network to get free calls to other customers of that mobile phone operator through a free unlimited mobile to mobile feature. 

Most mobile phone operators will require the customer's living or billing address be inside their coverage area or less often inside the government issued [[radio frequency]] license of the mobile phone operator, this is usually determined by a computer estimate because it is [[Dead zone (cell phone)|impossible to guarantee coverage]]. If a potential customer's address is not within the requirements of that mobile phone operator, they will be denied service. In order to permanently roam customers may use a false address and [[Electronic billing|online billing]], or a relative or friend's address which is in the required area, and a 3rd party billing option.

Most mobile phone operator discourage or prohibit permanent roaming since they must pay per minute rates to the network operator their customer is roaming onto to. This is because they can not pass that extra cost onto customers ("free roaming").

===Trombone roaming===
{{Main|Tromboning}}
Roaming calls within a local tariff area, when at least one of the phones belong outside that area. Usually implemented with ''trombone routing'' also known as ''tromboning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/2224213/cisco-subnet/why-the--trombone--effect-is-problematic-for-enterprise-internet-access.html|title=Why the 'trombone' effect is problematic for Enterprise Internet access|last=Gottlieb|first=Andy|work=Network World|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1810">'''Stall torque''' is the [[torque]] produced by a mechanical device whose output rotational speed is zero. It may also mean the torque load that causes the output rotational speed of a device to become zero, i.e., to cause [[Stall (engine)|stalling]].  Electric motors, steam engines and hydrodynamic transmissions are all capable of developing torque when stalled.

==Electric motors==
[[Electric motor]]s &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmology.net/motors.htm Notes on Motors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; continue to provide torque when stalled.  However, electric motors left in a stalled condition are prone to overheating and possible damage since the current flowing is maximum under these conditions.&lt;ref name="ele"&gt;A solar car primer, Eric F. Thacher, Nova Publishers, 2003, {{ISBN|1-59033-308-X}}, 9781590333082 p86. Google books link:[https://books.google.com/books?id=qvwlc8Zdo10C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA86,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The maximum torque an electric motor can produce in the long term when stalled without causing damage is called the '''''maximum continuous stall torque'''''&lt;ref name="ele"/&gt;

==Hydrodynamic transmissions==
A [[torque converter|hydrodynamic torque multiplier]] (torque converter) produces stall torque when the load prevents the turbine (output stage) from rotating while the pump (input stage) is being driven.  In most cases, damage due to overheating occurs if the stall condition persists for any significant length of time.  

==Combustion engines==
In the case of a [[petrol engine|petrol (gasoline)]] or [[Diesel engine]], the stall torque may refer to the torque load that causes the engine to stall.  The actual amount of torque is dependent on engine [[revolutions per minute|RPM]] and throttle opening.

'''SuKarne''' is a Mexican [[multinational corporation]] based in [[Culiacán]], [[Mexico]], that operates in the food protein industry. It is part of a family of companies under Grupo SuKarne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Ganjei | first = John | title = SuKarne Initiates Largest Beef Production and Processing Complex in Mexico = Market Scan | publisher = Mexicotoday.org | date = 28 Feb 2012 | url = http://mexicotoday.org/article/sukarne-initiates-largest-beef-production-and-processing-complex-mexico }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company annually exports the largest percentage of beef, pork, and chicken in Mexico, with at least 76% of the market. In 2010, the company had estimated world-wide beef sales of US$883 million,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sukarneglobal.com/about/worldwide/&lt;/ref&gt; after an export growth of 60% in just one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Aviles | first = Alberto | title = SuKarne's Exports Grow More Than 60 Percent in 2010 = Market Scan | publisher = prnewswire.com | date = 28 Jan 2011 | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sukarnes-exports-grow-more-than-60-percent-in-2010-114800599.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company makes a wide variety of animal-based and prepared products at its food processing plants. Currently, Grupo SuKarne generates more than 7,000 direct jobs, serves more than 40,000 customers, and maintains operations with companies in 18 countries. Its chain of production includes more than 80,000 agricultural and livestock providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = FLANIGAN | first = James | title = Border Companies Thrive on Mexican-Americans = Market Scan | publisher = nytimes.com | date = 17 June 2009 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/18/business/smallbusiness/18edge.html?_r=2&amp; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SuKarne is also one of the largest North American marketers of value-added chicken, beef, and pork to retail grocers, broad-line food service distributors, and national fast-food and full-service restaurant chains, fresh beef and pork, frozen and fully cooked chicken,  and case-ready beef and pork. It supplies many of the largest players in the food industry, including franchise restaurants, Walmart, HEB, and small restaurant businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sukarneglobal.com/press/|title= Sukarne Media and Press Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SuKarne's current chairman is [[Jesus Vizcarra Calderon]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Jesús Vizcarra en Mundo Fox Entrevista con Jackeline Cacho = Market Scan | publisher = youtube.com | date = 26 July 2012 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnZ_AqNEw3M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jesus Vizcarra Calderon==
As a young man, the current chairman of SuKarne, Jesus Vizcarra Calderon joined his family business, Corrales Vizcarra, an auxiliary cattle marketing and channel. In 1980, he was responsible for the general management. By 1985, Jesus took the chair of the company and founded SuKarne.

In October 2011, the 'Latin Business Association' recognized Calderon for his career in SuKarne and his strong push to bring health services to the poor people through a large, successful program called "''Salud Digna''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Jesús Vizcarra en Mundo Fox Entrevista con Jackeline Cacho = Market Scan | publisher = youtube.com | date = 26 July 2012 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnZ_AqNEw3M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Expansion Magazine'', he ranks 67th among the 100 most important businessmen in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sukarne.com/entrada/guadalupe-de-jesus-vizcarra-calderon&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investments==
In 2012, SuKarne announced it is investing $110 million to build the largest beef production and processing complex in Durango, Mexico. The complex is expected to create about 1,200 direct jobs and 6,000 indirect jobs, in addition to 680 jobs for initial construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Ganjei | first = John | title = SuKarne Initiates Largest Beef Production and Processing Complex in Mexico = Market Scan | publisher = mexicotoday.org | date = 28 Feb 2012 | url = http://mexicotoday.org/article/sukarne-initiates-largest-beef-production-and-processing-complex-mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sun Modular Datacenter''' ('''Sun MD''', known in the prototype phase as '''Project Blackbox''') is a portable [[data center]] built into a standard 20-foot [[intermodal container]] (shipping container) manufactured and marketed by [[Sun Microsystems]] (acquired in 2010 by [[Oracle Corporation]]). An external chiller and power were required for the operation of a Sun MD. A data center of up to 280 [[server (computing)|server]]s could be rapidly deployed by shipping the container in a regular way to locations that might not be suitable for a building or another structure, and connecting it to the required [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/products/sunmd/s20/specifications.jsp |title=Sun Modular Datacenter S20 - Technical Specifications |date=2008-05-27 |accessdate=2013-06-08 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226142103/http://www.sun.com/products/sunmd/s20/specifications.jsp |archivedate=February 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sun  stated that the system could be made operational for 1% of the cost of building a traditional data center.&lt;ref&gt;M.

On 14 July 2007, the [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]] (SLAC) deployed a Sun MD containing 252 [[Sun Fire]] X2200 compute nodes as a compute farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.slac.stanford.edu/feature/2007/blackbox1.asp|title=SLAC Prepares for First Blackbox to Expand Computing Power|date=2007-06-20|publisher=SLAC Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.slac.stanford.edu/feature/2007/blackbox2.asp|title=SLAC's Newest Computing Center Arrives... by Truck|date=2007-07-25|publisher=SLAC Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other customers include [[Radboud University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2009, the [[Internet Archive]] migrated its digital archive onto Sun Modular Datacenter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internet Archive and Sun Microsystems Create Living History of the Internet |url=http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2009-03/sunflash.20090325.1.xml |publisher=[[Sun Microsystems]] |date=2009-03-25 |accessdate=2013-06-08 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326200212/http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2009-03/sunflash.20090325.1.xml |archivedate=March 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Targeted reinnervation''' enables [[amputee]]s to control motorized [[prosthetic]] devices and to regain [[sensory feedback]]. The method was developed by Dr. Todd Kuiken at Northwestern University and Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago and Dr. Gregory Dumanian at Northwestern University Division of Plastic Surgery.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt;

== Overview ==
Targeted reinnervation has an [[efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] and an [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] component. Targeted muscle reinnervation is a method by which a spare muscle (the target muscle) of an amputated patient is denervated (its original nerves cut and/or de-activated), then reinnervated with residual nerves of the amputated limb.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt; The resultant [[Electromyography|EMG]] signals of the targeted muscle now represent the motor commands to the missing limb, and are used to drive a motorized prosthetic device.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt;

Targeted sensory reinnervation is a method by which skin near or over the targeted muscle is denervated, then reinnervated with afferent fibers of the remaining hand nerves.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt; Therefore, when this piece of skin is touched, it provides the amputee with a sense of the missing arm or hand being touched.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt;

=== Motivation ===
Several methods exist that seek to achieve advanced control of motorized neural prosthetics. [[Chronic Electrode Implants|Chronic brain implants]] record neuronal signals from the [[motor cortex]], while methods such as [[EEG]] and [[fMRI]] obtain motor commands non-invasively.&lt;ref name=PolikovEtal2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=ShwatzeEtal2006/&gt; The recorded signals are decoded into electrical signals, and input into assistive devices or motorized prosthetics.&lt;ref name=PolikovEtal2005/&gt; Traditional [[Neural prosthetics#Motor prosthetics for conscious control of movement|myoelectric]] prostheses utilize surface EMG signals from the remains of the amputated limb.&lt;ref name=Sears1992/&gt; For example, a patient may flex a shoulder muscle in order to generate EMG signals that may be used to send “bend elbow” command to the prosthesis. However, there are shortcomings to all of these methods. [[Chronic Electrode Implants|Chronic implants]] fail over a period of time because neuronal signal degrade due to tissue immune response to foreign bodies.&lt;ref name=PolikovEtal2005/&gt; EEG and fMRI do not obtain as strong signals as direct electrode implant.&lt;ref name=ShwatzeEtal2006/&gt; Traditional myoelectric prostheses are unable to provide multiple control signals simultaneously, thus only one action can be performed at a time.&lt;ref name=Sears1992/&gt; They are also unnatural to use because the users have to use muscles (such as shoulder) that are not normally involved with lower arm functions to control lower arm functions (such as opening and closing hands).&lt;ref name=Sears1992/&gt; The solution to these problems could include a completely different concept of neural interface.

=== Advantages ===
Targeted reinnervation does not require any implants. Therefore, it does not have the issue of tissue foreign body response as chronic brain implant technology does. The targeted muscle acts as a natural amplifier for the neuronal signals produced by the transferred residual nerves. This is an advantage over technologies like EEG and fMRI that utilize weaker signals. With targeted reinnervation, multiple yet independent EMG signals can be produced, thus multiple functions of the [[artificial limb]] can be controlled simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt; For example, the patient would be able to perform actions such as throwing a ball relatively gracefully, exhibiting simultaneous control of elbow and hand.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt; The control is also intuitive to the patient because the EMG signals are generated by transferred residual limb nerves, unlike traditional myoelectric prosthetics where EMG signals have to be generated by muscles normally not involved in arm or wrist functions.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt; Also, existing commercially available myoelectric prostheses, such as powered wrists, elbows can be used.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt; There is no need to develop specific prostheses for targeted reinnervation. By means of nerve transfer, targeted reinnervation can also provide sensory feedback, which has not been achieved by any other form of prosthetics aforementioned.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt;

== Methods ==

=== Targeted Muscle Reinnervation ===
The goal of targeted muscle reinnervation is to transfer multiple nerves into separate regions of the targeted muscle, record multiple yet independent signals from the muscle regions, and to use the EMG signals to control a motorized prosthesis sophisticated enough to process multiple control signals.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt;

==== Surgical Procedure ====
The requirement to transplant multiple nerves into a muscle region originated from a hypothesis that hyper-reinnervation, by which an excessive amount of motor neurons transferred to a muscle, can increase the reinnervation of muscle fibers hence improving the recovery of paralyzed muscles.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt; The hypothesis was tested on rat skeletal muscles and the result indicated that hyper-reinnervated muscles recovered more muscle mass and strength and more number of motor units were formed.&lt;ref name=KucikenEtal1995/&gt;

The first surgical patient was a [[bilateral shoulder disarticulation]] amputee.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt; Both arms were entirely amputated at the shoulder level, with only the shoulder blades remaining.  The [[Pectoralis major muscle|pectoral]] muscles were chosen targets because they were close to the shoulder, and they were also biologically non-functional due to detachment from the amputated arm.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt; The pectoral muscles were first denervated by cutting the original nerves that innervate them.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt; The [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] ends of the original nerves were ligated to prevent them from reinnervating the pectoral muscle.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt; Then the remnant arm nerves ([[brachial plexus]]) were transferred into the pectoral muscles.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt; The [[musculocutaneous nerve]] was transferred to the [[clavicular]] head of the [[pectoralis major]] muscle; the [[median nerve]] was transferred to the upper [[Human sternum|sternal]] of the pectoralis major muscle; the [[radial nerve]] was transferred to the lower sternal head of the pectoralis major muscle.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt; The [[pectoralis minor]] muscle was translocated from under the pectorialis major muscle to the lateral chest wall, so that its EMG signals would not interfere with those of the pectoralis major muscle, and it is also a fourth muscle target.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt; The [[ulnar nerve]] was then transferred to the moved pectoralis minor muscle.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt; The musculocutaneous, median, radial, and ulnar nerves ([[brachial plexus]]) were sewn onto the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] ends of the original pectoral muscle nerve fascicles and onto the muscle itself.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt; [[Subcutaneous tissue|Subcutaneous]] fat over the pectoral muscle was removed so that the electrodes can be as close to the muscle as possible to obtain optimal EMG signals.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt;

==== Post-surgical Training ====
About 3 months after surgery, the patient had the first twitch in pectoral muscle when he attempted to bend his phantom elbow.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt; Five months past surgery, he was able to contract four regions of pectoralis major muscle by attempting different moves.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt; For example, when the patient attempted to bend his elbow, the muscle region beneath the clavicle contracted strongly.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt; This was an indication of successful musculocutaneous nerve transfer because musculocutaneous nerve innervates biceps.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt; The patient was then soon put to a training session and a testing session. During training session, the patient was sitting in an upright position and shown each of the 27 normal movements (such as shoulder [[adduction]]/[[Abduction (kinesiology)|abduction]], hand open/close, elbow [[flexion]]/extension etc.) on a video.&lt;ref name=ZhouEtAl2005a/&gt; After each demonstration, the patient followed the movement 10 times, exerting a moderate force, held for 2.5 seconds.&lt;ref name=ZhouEtAl2005a/&gt; The patient was given 5 seconds of rest after each attempt.&lt;ref name=ZhouEtAl2005a/&gt; During the test session, the patient performed 5 sets of the 27 movements in random order.&lt;ref name=ZhouEtAl2005a/&gt; He was first shown a video of a movement, then asked to follow the repeated video of the same movement simultaneously after 2 seconds.&lt;ref name=ZhouEtAl2005a/&gt;

==== EMG Recording and Processing ====

A BioSemi Active II system (produced by BioSemi, Amsterdam, Netherlands) and a 127-channel [[electrode array]] were used to record [[monopolar]] EMG signals while patient was attempting movements during training and testing sessions.&lt;ref name=ZhouEtAl2005a/&gt; One hundred and fifteen electrodes were used to record EMG from the pectoral muscle; two electrodes were used to record from each of the [[Deltoid muscle|deltoid]], [[latissimus dorsi]], [[supraspinatus]], upper [[trapezius]], middle trapezius and lower trapezius muscles.&lt;ref name=ZhouEtAl2005a/&gt; The electrodes were placed at a distance of 15mm from each other.&lt;ref name=ZhouEtAl2005a/&gt; To remove the artifact caused by body movement, the EMG signals were preliminarily filtered with a fifth order [[Butterworth filter|butterworth high-pass filter]] set at 5&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name=ZhouEtAl2005a/&gt;

The major contaminant of the EMG signal was the [[ECG]] artifact.&lt;ref name=ZhouEtal2005b/&gt; To remove ECG noise, an ECG template was constructed by averaging ECG complexes recorded when muscles were relaxed.&lt;ref name=ZhouEtal2005b/&gt; The time between each ECG complex was used to calculate a representative inter-spike-interval.&lt;ref name=ZhouEtal2005b/&gt; Detection of ECG spikes was calculated from the correlations between EMG and the ECG template.&lt;ref name=ZhouEtal2005b/&gt; A threshold was set so that signals exceeding the threshold were marked as possible ECG spikes.&lt;ref name=ZhouEtal2005b/&gt; The inter-spike-intervals of the possible spikes were then compared to the previously calculated representative inter-spike-interval to determine whether the possible spikes were to be accepted as ECG artifacts.&lt;ref name=ZhouEtal2005b/&gt;

Another major task of processing the EMG signals is to eliminate [[crosstalk]] from other muscles.&lt;ref name=Stoykov2005/&gt; First, positions of and distance between electrodes are empirically determined to obtain strongest EMG thus least crosstalk.&lt;ref name=Stoykov2005/&gt; Setting a threshold above background noise and crosstalk from other muscles also helps eliminating crosstalk.&lt;ref name=Stoykov2005/&gt; Smaller muscle size and subcutaneous fat facilitate crosstalk.&lt;ref name=Stoykov2005/&gt; With a minimal level of less than 3mm subcutaneous fat, crosstalk is expected to be minimal in an area of 2–3&amp;nbsp;cm diameter.&lt;ref name=Stoykov2005/&gt;

==== Prosthetic Components ====
After surgery, the patient was fitted with his pre-surgery body-powered prosthesis on the right side and an experimental myoelectric prosthesis consisted of a Griefer terminal device, a power wrist rotator, a Boston digital arm, and an LTI-Collier Shoulder joint on the left side.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt; Three strongest EMG signals were chosen from the successful nerve transfers: the musculocutaneous nerve, the median nerve and the radial nerve.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt; The EMG resulting from contraction of muscle reinnvervated by median nerve was used to control hand closing movement; the EMG from musculocutaneous nerve was used to control elbow bending; the EMG from radial nerve was used to control wrist rotation and flexion.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt;

The performances of these two prostheses were compared with a [[Box and Blocks Test|box-and-blocks test]], where the patient was allowed 2 minutes to move one-inch cubes from one box to another, over a short wall.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt; The result was quantified by the total number of blocks moved.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt; To test the terminal device (“hand”), elbow and wrist rotator, the patient was administered a clothes-pin test, where he was asked to pick up clothes pins from a horizontal bar, rotate them, then put them on a higher vertical bar.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt; The time used to move 3 clothes-pins was recorded. Both tests were repeated 3 times.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt; The quantified results showed that the myoelectric prosthesis performed 246% better (moved 2.46 times more blocks) in box-and-blocks test, and 26.3% better (used 26.3% less time in moving clothes pins) in clothes-pin test.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt;

An experimental six-motor prosthesis was also constructed. The most striking feature of targeted reinnervation compared to traditional myoelectric prosthetics is its ability to provide multiple signals to control multiple functions simultaneously. Although current myoelectric prostheses can be used directly, they are designed and aimed at traditional myoelectric control. Thus, the only commercially available prosthesis only has powered terminal device (often a hook), wrist rotation and powered elbow.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt; To fully utilize the multiple signals provided by targeted reinnervation, an experimental prosthesis was constructed with added power components: a TouchEMAS shoulder, a [[humeral]] rotator, and a hand capable of opening and closing with wrist flexion/extension function. The elbow and hand functions were driven by four nerve transfer signals, and the humeral rotation was driven by EMG from latissumus dorsi and deltoids. With this six-motor prosthesis, the patient could control multiple joints at the same time and perform new tasks that could not be accomplished with other prostheses, such as reaching out to pick up objects and putting on a hat.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt;

=== Targeted Sensory Reinnervation ===

==== Discovery ====
Targeted sensory reinnervation was discovered by accident. While receiving an alcohol rub on his chest after the surgery, the patient described a sensation of being touched on the pinky. The explanation for this phenomenon is that, since his subcutaneous fat was removed during surgery, his chest skin was denervated. Thus, the afferent nerve fibers regenerated through the pectoral muscle, reinnervating the skin over the muscle.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt; Since then, areas of the pectoral muscle have been mapped to parts of arm and hand according to patient’s description of touch sensations he felt.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt; When touched in a specific region on the pectoral muscle, the patient would describe where in the [[phantom limb]] he felt as being touched.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt; For example, when touched in a region immediately above the nipple, he felt as if his anterior forearm was being touched.

==== Surgical Procedure ====
With this discovery, the team set out to perform nerve transfer surgery specifically aimed to reinnervate sensory feedback. A piece of skin near or over the targeted muscle was denervated, thus the afferent nerve fibers were allowed to reinnervate the skin.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt;
In a case of a woman patient with left arm amputation at the [[humeral]] neck, the [[supraclavicular]] sensory nerve was cut, the proximal end was ligated to prevent regeneration and reinnervation, and the distal end was coapted end-to-side to the ulnar nerve.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt; The [[intercostobrachial cutaneous nerve]] was treated with the same method, with the distal end coapted to the median nerve.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt;

This technique has been dubbed “transfer sensation”, and it has the potential of providing useful sensory feedback, such as pressure sensing, to help the patient judge the amount of force to be exerted.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt;

==== Assessment and Results ====
After surgery, the patient was asked to identify the chest areas with most prominent sensation of individual digits, which were then mapped onto a diagram.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt; The characteristic of the sensory reinnervation was quantified. Light touch is quantified by a threshold determined with Semmes-Weinstein [http://www.rehaboutlet.com/sensation_measurement.htm] monofilaments (a sensation measurement instrument).&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt; A Neurotip [[neurometer]] was used to determine the sensibility of sharpness and dullness at 20 sites distributed throughout the targeted muscle (the chest).&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt; A [[tuning fork]] was pressed against the points on the chest to assess patient’s ability to detect vibration.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt; A TSA II NeuroSensory Analyzer was used to assess temperature thresholds at two points on the chest.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt; The patient’s other (normal) pectoral muscle, normal arm and hand are used as controls.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt;

The patient was able to perceive all modalities of cutaneous sensation.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt; However, instead of normal pressure sensing, she perceived tingling in response to touch on the targeted chest skin.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt; The lowest threshold above which light touch could be sensed in the target muscle was 0•4 g, while the control chest muscle had a light-touch threshold of 0•16 g; the thresholds were under 4 g at most points in the area while the control chest had a threshold of 0.4 g at its counterpart locations.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt; The control chest demonstrated a much lower threshold hence higher sensibility. The patient was able to discern increasing, graded pressure.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt; She felt more tingling as the test pressure increased.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt; The patient also demonstrated perception of temperature. The mean threshold for coldness perception was 29•1&amp;nbsp;°C in the target muscle, and 29•9&amp;nbsp;°C in the control chest muscle.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt; The mean threshold for warmth perception was 35•2&amp;nbsp;°C in the target muscle, and 34•7&amp;nbsp;°C in the control chest muscle.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt; The patient was able to discern between sharp and dull stimuli and detect vibration at 19 of the 20 points selected for testing.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt; All the above sensations perceived by the patient were described by the patient as occurring in her phantom hand.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt;

== Risks and Complications ==

With extraordinary successes came certain risks and failures. The general risks of the surgery, in addition to standard risks of surgery, include permanent [[paralysis]] of the target muscle, recurrence of [[phantom limb pain]], and development of painful [[neuromas]].&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt;

With the first patient, the ulnar nerve transfer was not successful.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt; The muscle region was not reinnervated as expected, but instead turned bluish after mobilization, possibly due to a congestion of vascular supply.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt;

With the left-arm amputation woman mentioned above, her [[phantom limb]] pain returned after surgery.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt; Though at a lesser degree and resolved within 4 weeks, it still presented a serious risk because it is unclear whether it will resolve in other future patients.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtAl2007/&gt;
Additionally, surgery was unsuccessful with a patient because severe nerve injuries were not detectable until during the surgery.&lt;ref name=KuikenEtal2005/&gt;

It also remains in speculation whether the transferred nerves would survive permanently.

== Future Research and Development ==
The team has now moved onto a trial with [[Transhumeral prosthesis|transhumeral]] amputees (amputation above the elbow), with the hope that median nerve transfer in [[Transradial prosthesis|transradial]] amputation could potentially provide thumb control.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt; With all previous patients being upper limb amputees, the team also hopes to move on to lower limb amputees eventually.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt;

The nerves could also be further split to provide even more independent signals, so that more functions can be controlled simultaneously and more [[Degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]] can be gained in prosthesis control.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt; This could also prompt the production of more sophisticated prosthetic devices with more degrees of freedom, such as the six-motor experimental prosthesis mentioned above.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt;

Targeted reinnervation could also utilize implantable electrodes to record more localized signals from the target muscle, so that crosstalk can be further mitigated.&lt;ref name=Kuiken2006/&gt;

Much work is still to be done to translocate the sensory feedback from the reinnervated target muscle to the actual prosthesis, or to construct prostheses that are capable of providing appropriate stimuli to the reinnervated target muscle according to the external stimuli received, so that the sensory feedback of the arm comes from its native physical position.

Beginning in 2016, the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins began working with a patient having undergone both targeted muscle reinnervation and osseointegration of a titanium port to test and perfect their design for the Modular Prosthetic Limb funded by DARPA&lt;ref&gt;http://hub.jhu.edu/2016/01/12/prosthetic-limb-more-mobility-apl/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Terra Networks, S.A.''' is a Spanish Internet multinational company with headquarters in Spain and offices in [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], Mexico, the United States and [[Peru]]. Part of [[Telefónica]] Group (the former Spanish public telephone monopoly), Terra operates as a web portal or internet access provider in the U.S., Spain, and 16 Latin American countries. Terra was publicly traded on [[NASDAQ]] under the symbol TRLY and on the Spanish stock market under the symbol TRR.

== History ==
Terra was founded in 1999 by [[Juan Villalonga]], Telefónica's president between 1996 and 2000, and quickly turned into a major internet player through the aggressive acquisition of several local startups in Spain and the main Latin American markets: [[:es:Olé (buscador)|Olé]] (Spain), [[:pt:ZAZ|ZAZ]] ([[Brazil]]), Mexico, Gauchonet, Donde ([[Argentina]]) and Chevere ([[Venezuela]]).

Terra has also created several vertical portals, like Invertia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.invertia.com Invertia.com]&lt;/ref&gt; a successful finance portal, and Educaterra&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educaterra.com Educaterra.com]&lt;/ref&gt; (e-learning). It also has had or has stakes in other internet ventures: Uno-e&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uno-e.com Uno-e.com]&lt;/ref&gt; (online banking), Rumbo&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rumbo.com Rumbo.com]&lt;/ref&gt; (travel, in partnership with [[Amadeus CRS|Amadeus]]), Atrea&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atrea.com Atrea.com]&lt;/ref&gt; (real estate, in partnership with Spanish bank [[Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria|BBVA]]), Azeler&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azeler.com Azeler.com]&lt;/ref&gt; (car selling, also with BBVA), and Maptel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maptel.com Maptel.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041016011356/http://www.maptel.com/ |date=2004-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (online maps).

In November 1999, still during the period known as the "[[Internet bubble]]", Terra had a high-profile [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] both in the U.S. and Spain, and its shares skyrocketed from an initial price of 11.81 euros up to 157.65 euros in just 3 months. After that, the price fell sharply until it reached 2.75 euros in October 2004. This process sparked a lot of public controversy in Spain, where thousands of small investors acquired shares of Terra during the boom. Despite this problematic image, Terra managed to hold leading positions both as a web portal and as an ISP provider in several countries, and specially in Spain.

During 2003 and 2004 Terra expanded aggressively into the paid content business, mainly in Spain, Brazil, and Chile, launching ventures with [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] and Spanish football clubs [[Real Madrid]] and [[FC Barcelona]]. It also started several entertainment services, including an online multiplayer gaming platform (Terra Games) and a digital music service (Terra Música Premium) similar to [[Apple Computer|Apple Computer's]] [[iTunes]].

== Terra and Lycos ==
In April 2000, Terra surprised the internet market with the acquisition of [[Lycos]], the U.S. portal, in a [[stock swap]] valued at US$12.5 billion. By that time, Lycos was the third most visited portal in the U.S., according to Nielsen//NetRatings, and had a strong presence in key European and Asian markets. Specialists expected that the combination of Lycos with Terra's dominance in Latin America would create a powerful company, able even to challenge giants like [[AOL]], [[Yahoo!]]. Lycos CEO [[Bob Davis (businessman)|Bob Davis]] was moved to the position of CEO of the combined company, from where he stepped down in January 2001, being replaced by then Chairman Joaquim Agut.

Part of the deal was also German media giant [[Bertelsmann]], owner of a stake in Lycos Europe. In exchange for keeping the control over Lycos Europe, Bertelsmann agreed to spend US$1 billion worth in advertising at Terra Lycos through a five-year period. That spending was crucial for Terra to survive the times of the internet crash, when several Latin American-based internet companies like [[Quepasa]], [[Starmedia]] or [[El Sitio]] lost cash up to the point of filing for [[bankruptcy]] or being taken over by bigger companies.

In 2003 Bertelsmann executed an option to get itself out of the agreement, transferring to Terra's parent company Telefónica the obligation to keep the ad spending. Soon after that, Telefónica decided to get more control over Terra and launched an offer for shares of Terra still floating on the stock market. Although it granted Telefónica control over more than 70% of Terra's stock, the move was not successful enough to let Telefónica take Terra out of the public, as it was allegedly its objective.

In October 2004, following Telefónica's decision to re-focus their businesses, Terra sold Lycos to South Korean Internet portal company [[Daum Communications]] for US$105 million. Kim Faura was Terra's last chairman. Joaquim Agut was the previous one, and now he is chairman of [[Endemol]].

== Telefonica take-over ==
In February 2005, Telefónica announced its intention of taking full control of Terra by giving Telefónica' shares in exchange for Terra's remaining shares in the [[stock market]]. After this plan was approved by both Telefónica and Terra shareholders meetings, Terra's shares were finally excluded from the market on July 15, 2005.

From that moment, Terra Networks S.A. was merged into Telefónica, S.A. and, therefore, disappeared from a legal point of view. A small portion of the former corporate headquarters became "Terra Networks Asociadas, S.L.U." (a new company) and local Terra operations (and assets) were transferred to local fixed-line Telefónica companies.

== Terra.com ==
Terra is the largest Latin American online media company, ranked as the 31st most popular internet destination in the world. Offering Entertainment, News and Sports to the 100 million people who visit its portals monthly, Terra was named by Fast Company in 2011 as one of the most innovative company in the music area, "for a multipronged, and profitable, music-focused content model".

With 100 million unique visitors per month, Terra is present in 17 Latin American countries as well as in USA. It has offices in cities such as São Paulo and Porto Alegre (BRA), Buenos Aires (ARG), Santiago (CHI), Lima (PER), Bogota (COL), Mexico DF (MEX), Miami and New York (USA). Among Terra's most successful products and channels are Sonora (music) and Terra TV (premium video content) and the Planeta Terra annual music festival.

'''''That Should Not Be: Our Children Will Accuse Us''''' (Original title: ''Nos enfants nous accuseront'', US title: ''Food Beware: The French Organic Revolution'') is a 2008 [[France|French]] [[documentary film]] directed by [[Jean-Paul Jaud]].

The documentary is about food poisoning by [[toxin]]s from agricultural chemicals such as [[pesticide]]s, [[herbicide]]s, [[fertilizer]]s, etc.

==Plot==
The film tells the story of an initiative in [[Barjac, Gard|Barjac]], a [[commune]] located in the Gard department in southern [[France]], that decided to introduce [[organic food|organic produce]] into the town's school cafeteria. The film depicts without concessions the environmental tragedy which threatens the young generation: the poisoning of our country sides by agricultural pesticides (76 000 tons of pesticides used each year in France) and the harm caused to public health and safety.

'''''The Mirrored Heavens''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by [[David J. Williams]]. This is the author's [[debut novel]], and the first volume in his Autumn Rain trilogy, which continues with ''The Burning Skies'' and ''The Machinery Of Light''. The story begins in the year 2110 where global political power is balanced between the United States and the Eurasian Coalition (a primarily [[China|Chinese]] and Russian alliance). These two powers jointly constructed a [[space elevator]], which is destroyed by a [[terrorist]] attack before it can become operational.

The story follows the United States intelligence agents who are attempting to catch those responsible.

'''Traffic barriers''' (sometimes called '''Armco barriers''',&lt;ref name=Armco&gt;[[AK Steel]] (formerly Armco) [[genericized trademark]]&lt;/ref&gt; also known in North America as '''guardrails''' or [[guard rail]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Guardrail |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/guardrail |publisher=Oxford Dictionary|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Britain as '''crash barriers'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=crash barrier|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/crash-barrier|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries Online|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) keep [[vehicle]]s within their [[roadway]] and prevent them from colliding with dangerous [[obstacle]]s such as boulders, sign supports, trees, bridge abutments, buildings, walls, and large [[storm drain]]s, or from traversing steep (non-recoverable) slopes or entering deep water. They are also installed within [[road median|medians]] of divided highways to prevent errant vehicles from entering the opposing [[carriageway]] of traffic and help to reduce [[head-on collision]]s. Some of these barriers, designed to be struck from either side, are called median barriers. Traffic barriers can also be used to protect vulnerable areas like school yards, [[pedestrian zone]]s, and fuel tanks from errant vehicles.

While barriers are normally designed to minimize injury to vehicle occupants, injuries do occur in collisions with traffic barriers. They should only be installed where a collision with the barrier is likely to be less severe than a collision with the hazard behind it. Where possible, it is preferable to remove, relocate or modify a hazard, rather than shield it with a barrier.&lt;ref name="Barrier Need"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinemanuals.txdot.gov/txdotmanuals/rdw/barrier_need.htm#i1005219 |title=Barrier Need |work=TxDOT RDM |date=2010-05-01 |accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To make sure they are safe and effective, traffic barriers undergo extensive [[crash simulation|simulated]] and full scale [[crash test]]ing before they are approved for general use. While crash testing cannot replicate every potential manner of impact, testing programs are designed to determine the performance limits of traffic barriers and provide an adequate level of protection to road users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Roadside Design Guide |publisher=American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials |year=2002 |pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Need and placement==
Roadside hazards must be assessed for the danger they pose to traveling motorists based on size, shape, rigidity, and distance from the edge of travelway. For instance, small roadside signs and some large signs (ground-mounted breakaway post) often do not merit roadside protection as the barrier itself may pose a greater threat to general health and well-being of the public than the obstacle it intends to protect. In many regions of the world, the concept of clear zone is taken into account when examining the distance of an obstacle or hazard from the edge of travelway.

'''Clear zone,''' also known as clear recovery area or horizontal clearance&lt;ref name="Horizontal Clearances to Obstructions"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://onlinemanuals.txdot.gov/txdotmanuals/rdw/cross_sectional_elements.htm#BGBGBJBI|title=Cross Sectional Elements |work=TxDOT RDM |date=2010-05-01 |accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is defined (through study) as a lateral distance in which a motorist on a recoverable slope may travel outside of the travelway and return their vehicle safely to the roadway. This distance is commonly determined as the 85th percentile in a study comparable to the method of determining speed limits on roadways through speed studies and varies based on the classification of a roadway. In order to provide for adequate safety in roadside conditions, hazardous elements such as fixed obstacles or steep slopes can be placed outside of the clear zone in order to reduce or eliminate the need for roadside protection.

:Common sites for installation of traffic barrier:
:*Bridge ends
:*Near steep slopes from roadway limits
:*At drainage crossings or [[culvert]]s where steep or vertical drops are present
:*Near large signs/illumination poles or other roadside elements which may pose hazards

When barrier is needed, careful calculations are completed to determine length of need.&lt;ref name="Determining Length of Need of Barrier"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://onlinemanuals.txdot.gov/txdotmanuals/rdw/determining_length_of_need_of_barriers.htm|title=Determining Length of Need of Barrier |work=TxDOT RDM |date=2010-05-01 |accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculations take into account the speed and volume of traffic volume using the road, the distance from the edge of travelway to the hazard, and the distance or offset from the edge of travelway to the barrier.

==Barrier types and performance==
Traffic barriers are categorized in two ways: by the function they serve, and by how much they deflect when a vehicle crashes into them.

===Barrier functions===
[[File:Median barrier.jpg|thumb|Median barrier in Finland.]]
'''Roadside barriers''' are used to protect traffic from roadside obstacles or hazards, such as slopes steep enough to cause [[rollover]] crashes, fixed objects like bridge piers, and bodies of water. Roadside barriers can also be used with medians, to prevent vehicles from colliding with hazards within the median.

'''Median barriers''' are used to prevent vehicles from crossing over a median and striking an oncoming vehicle in a [[head-on crash]]. Unlike roadside barriers, they must be designed to be struck from either side.

'''Bridge barrier''' is designed to restrain vehicles from crashing off the side of a bridge and falling onto the roadway, river or railroad below. It is usually higher than roadside barrier, to prevent trucks, buses, pedestrians and cyclists from vaulting or rolling over the barrier and falling over the side of the structure. Bridge rails are usually multi-rail tubular steel barriers or reinforced concrete parapets and barriers.

'''Work zone barriers''' are used to protect traffic from hazards in work zones. Their distinguishing feature is they can be relocated as conditions change in the road works. Two common types are used: temporary concrete barrier and water-filled barrier. The latter is composed of steel-reinforced plastic boxes that are put in place where needed, linked together to form a longitudinal barrier, then ballasted with water. These have an advantage in that they can be assembled without heavy lifting equipment, but they cannot be used in freezing weather.

===Barrier stiffness===
Barriers are divided into three groups, based on the amount they deflect when struck by a vehicle and the mechanism the barrier uses to resist the impact forces. In the [[United States]], traffic barriers are tested and classified according to the AASHTO Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH) standards, which recently superseded [[Federal Highway Administration]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20101208101724/http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/roadway_dept/policy_guide/road_hardware/nchrp_350/ NCHRP Report 350]. Barrier deflections listed below are results from [[crash test]]s with a {{convert|2000|kg|abbr=on}} pickup truck traveling {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}}, colliding with the rail at a 25 degree angle.&lt;ref&gt;Roadside Design Guide, American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials, 2004, pages 5-10 to 5-23&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flexible barriers''' include [[cable barriers]] and weak post corrugated guide rail systems. These are referred to as flexible barriers because they will deflect {{convert|1.6|to|2.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} when struck by a typical passenger car or light truck. Impact energy is dissipated through tension in the rail elements, deformation of the rail elements, posts, soil and vehicle bodywork, and friction between the rail and vehicle.

[[File:crash barrier-int.png|thumb|Components of a standard guiderail (A-profile): S – guardrail, D – distance piece/spacer, P – sigma post]]

'''Semi-rigid barriers''' include box beam guide rail, heavy post blocked out corrugated guide rail and thrie-beam guide rail. Thrie-beam is similar to corrugated rail, but it has three ridges instead of two. They deflect {{convert|3|to|6|ft|m|2}}: more than rigid barriers, but less than flexible barriers. Impact energy is dissipated through deformation of the rail elements, posts, soil and vehicle bodywork, and friction between the rail and vehicle. Box beam systems also spread the impact force over a number of posts due to the stiffness of the steel tube.

[[File:Jersey barrier 2.png|upright|thumb|{{convert|1.1|m|in|0|adj=on|sp=us}}-high version of the Jersey barrier for deflecting [[automobile]]s and [[semi-trailer truck]]s]]

'''Rigid barriers''' are usually constructed of reinforced concrete. A permanent concrete barrier will only deflect a negligible amount when struck by a vehicle. Instead, the shape of a concrete barrier is designed to redirect a vehicle into a path parallel to the barrier. This means they can be used to protect traffic from hazards very close behind the barrier, and generally require very little maintenance. Impact energy is dissipated through redirection and deformation of the vehicle itself. [[Jersey barriers]] and [[F-shape barrier]]s also lift the vehicle as the tires ride up on the angled lower section. For low-speed or low-angle impacts on these barriers, that may be sufficient to redirect the vehicle without damaging the bodywork. The disadvantage is there is a higher likelihood of rollover with a small car than the single slope or step barriers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/roadway_dept/policy_guide/road_hardware/qa_bttabr.cfm#brrs4 "Frequently Asked Questions: Barriers, Terminals, Transitions, Attenuators, and Bridge Railings"], Federal Highway Administration. Access date 2/15/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Impact forces are resisted by a combination of the rigidity and mass of the barrier. Deflection is usually negligible.

An early concrete barrier design was developed by the [[New Jersey]] State Highway Department. This led to the term [[Jersey barrier]] being used as a generic term, although technically it applies to a specific shape of concrete barrier. Other types include [[constant-slope barrier]]s, [[concrete step barrier]]s, and [[F-shape barrier]]s.

Concrete barriers usually have smooth finishes. At some impact angles, coarse finishes allow the drive wheel of front wheel drive vehicles to climb the barrier, potentially causing the vehicle to roll over. However, along [[parkway]]s and other areas where aesthetics are considered important, reinforced concrete walls with stone veneers or faux stone finishes are sometimes used. These barrier walls usually have vertical faces to prevent vehicles from climbing the barrier.

==Barrier end treatments==
[[File:Mitigate barrera de contencion.PNG|thumb|A crash barrier terminal which has been crushed in a collision]]
Early traffic barrier designs often paid little attention to the ends of the barriers, so they either ended abruptly in blunt ends, or sometimes featured some flaring of the edges away from the side of the barrier facing traffic. Vehicles that struck blunt ends at the wrong angle could stop too suddenly or have steel rail sections penetrate into the passenger compartment, resulting in severe injuries or fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;Roadside Design Guide, American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials, 2004, page 8-1&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a new style of barrier terminals were developed in the 1960s in which the installers were directed to twist the guardrail 90 degrees and bring its end down so that it would lie flat at ground level (so-called "turned-down" terminals). While this innovation prevented the rail from penetrating the vehicle, it could also vault a vehicle into the air or cause it to roll over, since the rising and twisting guardrail formed a ramp. These crashes often led to vehicles flying at high speed into the very objects which guardrails or barriers were supposed to protect them from in the first place.

To address the vaulting and rollover crashes, energy-absorbing terminals were developed. The first generation of these terminals in the 1970s were breakaway cable terminals, in which the rail curves back on itself and is connected to a cable that runs between the first and second posts (which are often breakaway posts). The second generation, in the 1990s and 2000s, feature a large steel impact head that engages the frame or bumper of the vehicle. The impact head is driven back along the guide rail, dissipating the vehicle's kinetic energy by bending or tearing the steel in the guide rail sections. A guide rail may also be terminated by curving it back to the point that the terminal is unlikely to be hit end-on, or, if possible, by embedding the end in a hillside or cut slope.

[[File:FitchBarrels2008.jpg|thumb|Sand filled barrels in Canada used as [[impact attenuator]]s.]]
An alternative to energy absorbing barrier terminals are [[impact attenuator]]s. These are used for wider hazards that can't be effectively protected with a one-sided traffic barrier.

[[Tire recycling|Recycled tyres]] have been proposed for highway crash barriers, but most governments prefer sand-filled crash barriers because they have excellent absorption characteristics and are easier to erect and dismantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/tires/tires.pdf |title=Markets for Scrap Tires |work=Office of Solid Waste |publisher=[[EPA]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710045331/http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/tires/tires.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-10 |accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Fitch Barrier]] is a type of impact attenuator consisting of a sand-filled plastic barrels, usually yellow colored with a black lid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racesafety.com/fitchbarr.html "The Fitch Barrier"], ''Race Safety''.&lt;/ref&gt; Fitch barriers are often found in a triangular arrangement at the end of a [[guard rail]] between a [[highway]] and an exit lane (the area known as the [[Gore (road)|gore]]), along the most probable line of impact. The barriers in front contain the least sand, with each successive barrel containing more, so that when a vehicle collides with the barrels they shatter, the [[kinetic energy]] is dissipated by scattering the sand and the vehicle decelerates smoothly instead of violently striking a solid obstruction, reducing the risk of injury to the occupants. Fitch barriers are widely popular due to their effectiveness, low cost, and ease of setup and repair or replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Wharton, Tom, [http://www.racesafety.com/pdf/saltlaketribune.pdf "Time can't catch up with 86-year-old hot rodder"], ''The Salt Lake Tribune'' via ''Race Safety'', August 14, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Transocean Marianas''''' is an Earl &amp; Wright Sedco 700 design [[semi-submersible]] drilling unit capable of operating in harsh environments and water depths up to {{convert|7000|ft|m}} using an {{convert|18.75|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=flip}}, 15,000 psi [[blowout preventer]] (BOP), and a {{convert|21|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=flip}} outside diameter (OD) [[marine riser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=''Transocean Marianas'' | url=http://www.deepwater.com/fw/main/Transocean-Marianas-77C14.html?LayoutID=17 | publisher=Transocean | year=2010 | accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Transocean Marianas'' currently operates [[offshore drilling]] activities in Namibia under contract from HRT Participações em Petróleo S.A. Throughout her career, she has operated under several names: '''''Tharos''''' from 1979 to 1994, '''''Polyportia''''' from 1994 to 1996, and '''''P. Portia''''' from 1996 to 1998.

On October 7, 2009, it began drilling on the [[Macondo Prospect|Macondo well]] in the Gulf of Mexico.  On November 9, 2009. it was damaged by [[Hurricane Ida (2009)|Hurricane Ida]].  It was subsequently replaced by the ''[[Deepwater Horizon]]'', which was responsible for the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] when that rig exploded on April 20, 2010.&lt;ref name="waxman"&gt;{{cite web | title = Letter from Henry Waxman to Tony Hayward - June 14, 2010 | format = press release | publisher = nergycommerce.house.gov | date = 2010-06-14 | url = http://energycommerce.house.gov/documents/20100614/Hayward.BP.2010.6.14.pdf | accessdate = 2010-06-14 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101207021018/http://energycommerce.house.gov/documents/20100614/Hayward.BP.2010.6.14.pdf | archivedate = December 7, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Piper Alpha'' incident==
In 1988, as '''''Tharos''''', the vessel operated as a large [[Fireboat|firefighting]], construction, diving support and accommodation vessel equipped with a helicopter and a [[hospital ship]] with 22 beds, that rescued survivors from the ''[[Piper Alpha]]'' [[oil platform]] [[disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lancaster | first=John Frederick | title=Engineering Catastrophes: Causes and Effects of Major Accidents | location=Cambridge | publisher=Woodhead Publishing | pages=121–122 | year=2000 | isbn=1-85573-505-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ws-BRoRlelkC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA121 | accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The vessel carried out firefighting on the night of the disaster and supported the fire fighting and [[well kill]] operations that led to the extinguishing of the blaze. However, flaws in the design of the vessel's extensible rescue arm prevented it from rescuing crew from the platform, while errors in the operation of the [[water cannon]] delayed their use. Divers from ''Tharos'' recovered many bodies from the [[seabed]] and from the [[Galley_(kitchen)|galley]] area of ''Piper Alpha''. ''Tharos'''s role in the early hours of the disaster was shown in the 1990 [[Scottish Television]] series ''[[Rescue (UK TV series)|Rescue]]''.

==2011 Ghana incident==
On July 6, 2011, the ''Transocean Marianas'' was evacuated due to it taking on water off the coast of Ghana.

Pioneered by UK based [[IMO Precision Controls Ltd]], and later adopted by other manufacturers in this marketplace such as Santon and [[ABB]], the isolator design incorporates a user independent switching action so as the handle is moved, it interacts with a spring mechanism which, upon reaching a set point, causes the contacts to "SNAP" over, thereby ensuring a very fast break/make action. This mechanism means that the disconnection of the load circuits and the suppression of the electrical arc, produced by a constant DC load, is normally extinguished in a maximum of 5ms using the specific pole suppression chambers incorporated into the design.

Many alternative solutions, particularly those based upon an AC Switch Disconnect design which use bridge contacts, have been modified and rated for DC operation. These types of product have a switching speed that is directly linked to the operator speed, therefore slow operation of the handle results in slow contact separation of the contacts which can produce arcing times of 100ms or more. Additionally in these switches, the contact surface is also the surface upon which electrical arcs tend to form; therefore any surface damage or sooting caused by arcing is likely to have a detrimental effect on the isolators contact resistance and its longevity.
[[File:Rotary "Knife Contacts".jpg|thumb|Rotary "Knife Contacts" found in TRUE DC isolators]]
TRUE DC Solar Isolators use a rotary [[Knife switch|knife contact]] mechanism so when the unit is operated, the handle movement gives a double make/break per contact set. As DC load switching creates electrical [[Electric arc|arcing]], the design is such that this only occurs on the corners of the switching parts meaning that the main contact is made on an area where no arcing has occurred. The rotary contact mechanism methodology used in TRUE DC solar isolators means that when the isolator is operated, a self-cleaning action occurs on the arcing points and contact surfaces thereby producing good high-vibration resistant contact integrity, with reduced contact resistance. This contact system ensures that power loss per [[Switch#Contact terminology|pole]] is kept as low as possible, and consistent over the life of the product, unlike conventional style isolators where entrapment of contaminants, and then subsequent compression on lateral operation, can lead to variable and increasing contact resistance, and hence per pole losses.

The overall design of a TRUE DC solar isolator is satisfactory for use in installations classified as either DC-21A, DC-21B or DC-22A, and so suitable for a high number of "off load" operations (without current) and also a high number of operating cycles "on load" (with current).

A further advantage of the TRUE DC mechanism is that in the event of the supply to earth failure, the high short circuit current pulls the contacts together, thereby giving high short circuit withstand current of up to 2400Amps (product dependent). Residential photovoltaic installations are typically 1000VDC, however the majority of the TRUE DC isolators available on the market today already have the capability to operate up to 1500VDC.

In the move towards safer installations of PV systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bre.co.uk/page.jsp?id=3211|title=BRE Group: Fire safety and solar electric/photovoltaic systems|website=www.bre.co.uk|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; whether it be in a domestic or industrial environment, consideration has to often be given to the materials and the risk of fire hazard&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bre.co.uk/nsc/page.jsp?id=3676|title=BRE: Fire Incidents involving Solar Power|website=www.bre.co.uk|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.solargain.com.au/dc-isolator-recalls|title=DC isolator switch recalls|last=|date=2014-05-22|website=Solar Panels {{!}} Solar Energy &amp; Power Systems - Solargain|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; that they pose. Ratings referred to under the [[UL 94]] category are deemed generally acceptable for compliance with this requirement as this cover tests for flammability of polymeric materials used for parts in devices and appliances. Although there are 12 flame classifications specified in UL 94, there are 6 which relate to materials commonly used in manufacturing enclosures, structural parts and insulators found in consumer electronic products. These are 5VA, 5VB, V-0, V-1, V-2 and HB.

With the advent of more worldwide installations and the requirements laid down in many country’s national wiring publications for the use of DC switches in PV installations, TRUE DC Solar Isolators must also be assessed and tested under the latest [[UL (safety organization)|UL]] standard UL508I which has been specifically written to cover the use of “Manual Disconnect Switches intended for use in Photovoltaic Systems”.

This UL508I standard specifically covers switches rated up to 1500 V that are intended for use in an ambient temperatures of -20&amp;nbsp;°C to +60&amp;nbsp;°C, and that are suitable for use on the load side of PV branch protection devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ulstandards.ul.com/standard/?id=508I&amp;edition=2&amp;doctype=outline|title=Outline of Investigation for Disconnect Switches Intended for Use in Photovoltaic Systems|website=ulstandards.ul.com|access-date=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17161">'''Ventilative cooling''' is the use of [[Natural ventilation|natural]] or [[mechanical ventilation]] to cool indoor spaces.&lt;ref name= Per&gt;P. Heiselberg, M. Kolokotroni. "[http://venticool.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SOTAR-Annex-62-FINAL.pdf Ventilative Cooling. State of the art review]". Department of Civil Engineering. Aalborg University, Denmark. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The use of outside air reduces the [[Cooling load|cooling]] load and the [[Domestic energy consumption|energy consumption]] of these systems, while maintaining high quality indoor conditions. Ventilative cooling strategies are applied in a wide range of [[buildings]] and may even be critical to realize renovated or new high efficient buildings and zero-energy buildings ([[ZEB]]s) &lt;ref&gt;venticool, the international platform for ventilative cooling. “[http://venticool.eu/faqs/what-is-ventilative-cooling/ What is ventilative cooling]?”. Retrieved June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Ventilation (architecture)|Ventilation]] is present in buildings mainly for [[Indoor air quality|air quality]] reasons. It can be used additionally to remove both excess heat gains, as well as increase the velocity of the air and thereby widen the [[thermal comfort]] range.&lt;ref&gt;F. Nicol, M. Wilson. "An overview of the European Standard EN 15251". Proceedings of Conference: Adapting to Change: New Thinking on Comfort. Cumberland Lodge, Windsor, UK, 9-11 April 2010. &lt;/ref&gt; Ventilative cooling is assessed by long-term evaluation indices &lt;ref&gt;S. Carlucci, L. Pagliano. “A review of indices for the long-term evaluation of the general thermal comfort conditions in buildings”. Energy and Buildings 53:194-205 · October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;.Ventilative cooling is dependent on the availability of appropriate external conditions and on the thermal physical characteristics of the building.

==Background==

In the last years, overheating in buildings has been a challenge not only during the design stage but also during the operation. The reasons are: &lt;ref&gt;AECOM “[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7604/2185850.pdf Investigation of overheating in homes]”. Department for Communities and Local Government, UK. {{ISBN|978-1-4098-3592-9}}. July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;NHBC Foundation. “[https://www.nhbcfoundation.org/publication/overheating-in-new-homes/ Overheating in new homes. A review of the evidence]”. {{ISBN|978-1-84806-306-8}}. 6 December, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* High performance energy standards which reduce heating demand in heating dominated climates. Mainly refer to increase of the [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] levels and restriction on [[Infiltration (HVAC)|infiltration]] rates
* The occurrence of higher outdoor temperatures during the cooling season, because of the [[climate change]] and the [[heat island effect]] not considered at the design phase
* Internal heat gains and occupancy behavior were not calculated with accuracy during the design phase (gap in performance).
In many post-occupancy comfort studies overheating is a frequently reported problem not only during the summer months but also during the transitions periods, also in temperate climates.

==Potentials and limitations==

The effectiveness of ventilative cooling has been investigated by many researchers and has been documented in many post occupancy assessments reports &lt;ref&gt;H. Awbi. “[https://adminimages.muhandes.net/content/library/dcc2b59fcffb442b9862e878412d58eb.pdf Ventilation Systems: Design and Performance]”. Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|978-0419217008}}. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;M. Santamouris, P.  Wouters. “Building Ventilation: The State of the Art”. Routledge. {{ISBN|978-1844071302}}. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=Allard&gt;F. Allard. “Natural Ventilation in Buildings: A Design Handbook”. Earthscan Publications Ltd. {{ISBN|978-1873936726}}. 1998&lt;/ref&gt;.The system cooling effectiveness ([[Natural ventilation|natural]] or [[mechanical ventilation]]) depends on the [[air flow]] rate that can be established, the [[thermal capacity]] of the construction and the [[heat transfer]] of the elements. During cold periods the cooling power of outdoor air is large. The risk of draughts is also important. During summer and transition months outdoor air cooling power might not be enough to compensate overheating indoors during daytime and application of ventilative cooling will be limited only during the night period. The night ventilation may remove effectively accumulated heat gains (internal and [[Solar gain|solar]]) during daytime in the [[Building construction|building constructions]] &lt;ref&gt;M. Santamouris, D. Kolokotsa. "Passive cooling dissipation techniques for buildings and other structures: The state of the art". Energy and Building 57: 74-94. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;.
For the assessment of the cooling potential of the location simplified methods have been developed &lt;ref&gt;C. Ghiaus. "[https://www.construction21.org/france/community/action/file/download?file_guid=28875 Potential for free-cooling by ventilation]". Solar Energy 80: 402-413. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;N. Artmann, P. Heiselberg. "Climatic potential for passive cooling of buildings by night-time ventilation in Europe". Applied Energy. 84 (2): 187-201. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;A. Belleri, T. Psomas, P. Heiselberg, Per. "[http://aivc.org/resource/evaluation-tool-climate-potential-ventilative-cooling Evaluation Tool of Climate Potential for Ventilative Cooling]". 36th AIVC Conference " Effective ventilation in high performance buildings", Madrid, Spain, 23-24 September 2015. p 53-66. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; R. Yao, K. Steemers, N. Baker. "Strategic design and analysis method of natural ventilation for summer cooling". Build Serv Eng Res Technol. 26 (4). 2005&lt;/ref&gt;. These methods use mainly building characteristics information, comfort range indices and local climate data. In most of the simplified methods the [[thermal inertia]] is ignored.

The critical limitations for ventilative cooling are:
* Impact of [[global warming]]
* Impact of [[urban environment]]
* Outdoor noise levels
* Outdoor [[air pollution]]
* Pets and insects
* Security issues
* Locale limitations

==Existing regulations==

Ventilative cooling requirements in regulations are complex. Energy performance calculations in many countries worldwide do not explicitly consider ventilative cooling. The available tools used for energy performance calculations are not suited to model the impact and effectiveness of ventilative cooling, especially through annual and monthly calculations &lt;ref&gt;M. Kapsalaki, F.R. Carrié. "[http://venticool.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/venticool-paper-Provisions-for-ventilative-cooling.pdf Overview of provisions for ventilative cooling within 8 European building energy performance regulations]". venticool, the international platform for ventilative cooling. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Case studies==

A large number of buildings using ventilative cooling strategies have already been built around the world &lt;ref&gt;P. Holzer, T. Psomas, P. O’Sullivan. "International ventilation cooling application database". CLIMA 2016 : Proceedings of the 12th REHVA World Congress, 22-25 May 2016, Aalborg, Denmark. 2016&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;venticool, the international platform for ventilative cooling. “[http://venticool.eu/annex-62-publications/ventilative-cooling-application-database/ Ventilative Cooling Application Database]”. Retrieved June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;P. O’Sullivan, A. O’ Donovan. [http://venticool.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/VC-Case-Studies-EBC-Annex-62-May-2018-Final.pdf Ventilative Cooling Case Studies]. Aalborg University, Denmark. 2018&lt;/ref&gt;. Ventilative cooling can be found not only in traditional, pre-air-condition architecture, but also in temporary European and international [[Low-energy house|low energy buildings]]. For these buildings passive strategies are priority. When passive strategies are not enough to achieve comfort, active strategies are applied. In most cases for the summer period and the transition months, automatically controlled [[natural ventilation]] is used. During the heating season, mechanical ventilation with [[Heat recovery ventilation|heat recovery]] is used for [[indoor air quality]] reasons. Most of the buildings present high [[thermal mass]]. User behavior is crucial element for successful performance of the method.

==Building components and control strategies==

Building components of ventilative cooling are applied on all three levels of climate-sensitive building design, i.e. site design, architectural design and technical interventions . A grouping of these components follows &lt;ref name= Per/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;P. Holzer, T.Psomas. [http://venticool.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/VC-Sourcebook-EBC-Annex-62-March-2018.pdf Ventilative cooling sourcebook]. Aalborg University, Denmark. 2018&lt;/ref&gt;:

* Airflow guiding ventilation components ([[Window|windows]], rooflights, [[doors]], dampers and grills, [[Fan (machine)|fans]], flaps, louvres, special effect vents) 
* Airflow enhancing ventilation building components ([[chimneys]], atria, venturi ventilators, wind catchers, [[wind towers]] and scoops, double facades, [[Ventilated wall|ventilated walls]])
* Passive cooling building components (convective components, evaporative components, phase change components)
* Actuators (chain, linear, rotary)
* Sensors ([[temperature]], [[humidity]], [[air flow]], [[radiation]], [[CO2]], rain, [[wind]])

Control strategies in ventilative cooling solutions have to control the magnitude and the direction, of air flows in space and time &lt;ref name= Per/&gt;. Effective control strategies ensure high indoor comfort levels and minimum [[energy consumption]]. Strategies in a lot of cases include temperature and CO2 monitoring &lt;ref name=PHed&gt;P. Heiselberg (ed.). “[http://venticool.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/VC-Design-Guide-EBC-Annex-62-March-2018.pdf Ventilative Cooling Design Guide]”. Aalborg University, Denmark. 2018&lt;/ref&gt;. In many buildings in which occupants had learned how to operate the systems, energy use reduction was achieved. Main control parameters are operative (air and radiant) temperature (both peak, actual or average), occupancy, carbon dioxide concentration and humidity levels &lt;ref name=PHed/&gt;. Automation is more effective than personal control &lt;ref name= Per/&gt;. Manual control or manual override of automatic control are very important as it affects user acceptance and appreciation of the indoor climate positively (also cost)&lt;ref&gt;R.G. de Dear, G.S. Brager. "[http://www.sysecol2.ethz.ch/OptiControl/LiteratureOC/Dear_02_EB_34_549.pdf Thermal Comfort in Naturally Ventilated Buildings: Revisions to ASHRAE Standard 55]". Energy and Buildings. 34 (6).2002&lt;/ref&gt;.The third option is that operation of facades is left to personal control of the inhabitants, but the [[building automation system]] gives active feedback and specific advises.

==Existing methods and tools==

[[Building design]] is characterized by different detailed design levels. In order to support the decision-making process towards ventilative cooling solutions, airflow models with different resolution are used.
Depending on the detail resolution required, airflow models can be grouped into two categories&lt;ref name= Per/&gt;:
* Early stage modelling tools, which include empirical models, monozone model, bidimensional airflow network models;and
* Detailed modelling tools, which include airflow network models, coupled BES-AFN models, zonal models, [[Computational fluid dynamics|Computational Fluid Dynamic]],coupled CFD-BES-AFN models.

Existing literature includes reviews of available methods for airflow modelling. &lt;ref name= Allard/&gt; &lt;ref&gt; M. Caciolo, D. Marchio, P. Stabat.

Taylor &amp; Francis. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==IEA EBC Annex 62==

Annex 62 ‘ventilative cooling’ is a research project of the ‘[[International Energy Agency Energy in Buildings and Communities Programme|Energy in Buildings and Communities Programme]] (EBC)’ of the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA), with a four-year working phase (2014–2018)&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency’s Energy in Buildings and Communities Programme, "[http://www.iea-ebc.org/projects/ongoing-projects/ebc-annex-62/ EBC Annex 62 Ventilative Cooling]", Retrieved June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;.
The main goal is to make ventilative cooling an attractive and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficient]] cooling solution to avoid overheating of both new and [[Renovation|renovated buildings]]. The results from the Annex will facilitate better possibilities for prediction and estimation of heat removal and overheating risk – for both design purposes and for energy performance calculation. The documented performance of ventilative cooling systems through analysis of case studies will promote the use of this technology in future high performance and conventional buildings &lt;ref&gt;venticool, the international platform for ventilative cooling. “[http://venticool.eu/annex-62-about/ About Annex 62]”. Retrieved June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;.
To fulfil the main goal the Annex has the following targets for the research and development work:
* To develop and evaluate suitable design methods and tools for prediction of cooling need, ventilative cooling performance and risk of overheating in buildings.
* To develop guidelines for an [[Energy conservation|energy-efficient reduction]] of the risk of overheating by ventilative cooling solutions and for design and operation of ventilative cooling in both [[Residential building|residential]] and [[commercial buildings]].
* To develop guidelines for integration of ventilative cooling in energy performance calculation methods and regulations including specification and verification of key performance indicators.
* To develop instructions for improvement of the ventilative cooling capacity of existing systems and for development of new ventilative cooling solutions including their control strategies.
* To demonstrate the performance of ventilative cooling solutions through analysis and evaluation of well-documented case studies.
The Annex 62 research work is divided in three subtasks.
* '''Subtask A''' “Methods and Tools” analyses, develops and evaluates suitable design methods and tools for prediction of cooling need, ventilative cooling performance and risk of overheating in buildings. The subtask also gives guidelines for integration of ventilative cooling in energy performance calculation methods and regulation including specification and verification of key performance indicators.
* '''Subtask B''' “Solutions” investigates the cooling performance of existing mechanical, natural and hybrid ventilation systems and technologies and typical comfort control solutions as a starting point for extending the boundaries for their use. Based upon these investigations the subtask also develops recommendations for new kinds of flexible and reliable ventilative cooling solutions that create comfort under a wide range of climatic conditions.
* '''Subtask C''' “Case studies” demonstrates the performance of ventilative cooling through analysis and evaluation of well-documented case studies.
