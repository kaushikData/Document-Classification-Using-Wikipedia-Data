      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6530">The primary '''administrative divisions of South Africa''' are the nine [[Provinces of South Africa|provinces]]. The provinces are divided into [[metropolitan municipality (South Africa)|metropolitan]] and [[district municipality (South Africa)|district municipalities]], with the district municipalities being further divided into [[local municipality (South Africa)|local municipalities]]. Metropolitan and local municipalities are divided into [[electoral ward (South Africa)|wards]].

==Provinces==
[[File:Map of South Africa with English labels.svg|thumb|The provinces of South Africa]]
{{main|Provinces of South Africa}}
Since 1994, South Africa has been divided into nine provinces: the [[Eastern Cape]], the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]], [[Gauteng]], [[KwaZulu-Natal]], [[Limpopo (South African province)|Limpopo]], [[Mpumalanga]], [[North West (South African province)|North West]], the [[Northern Cape]] and the [[Western Cape]]. The boundaries of the provinces, which are specified in the [[Constitution of South Africa|national constitution]], have been altered twice by constitutional amendment.

Each province is governed by a unicameral [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|legislature]] elected by [[party-list proportional representation]], and a [[Premier (South Africa)|Premier]] elected by the legislature. The provincial legislatures are represented in the [[Parliament of South Africa|national Parliament]] by their delegations to the [[National Council of Provinces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southafrica.info/about/government/govprov.htm |title=Provincial government |work=SouthAfrica.info |publisher=Brand South Africa |accessdate=22 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317022409/http://www.southafrica.info/about/government/govprov.htm |archive-date=2011-03-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metropolitan municipalities==
[[File:Map of the metropolitan municipalities of South Africa (2016).svg|thumb|right|The eight metropolitan municipalities]]
{{main|Metropolitan municipality (South Africa)}}
Eight of South Africa's largest cities are governed as metropolitan municipalities, which exercise all municipal functions in their areas, in contrast with the divided responsibilities in areas with the district/local system (see below).&lt;ref name="sainfo-local"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southafrica.info/about/government/govlocal.htm |title=Local government |work=South Africa.info |publisher=Brand South Africa |accessdate=22 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030171908/http://www.southafrica.info/about/government/govlocal.htm |archive-date=2016-10-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Metropolitan municipalities are governed by councils in which half of the councillors are directly elected from the wards (see below) and half are elected by [[party-list proportional representation]].&lt;ref name="etu-electoral"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etu.org.za/toolbox/docs/govern/elections.html |title=Elections in South Africa |work=Community Organisers Toolbox |publisher=Education and Training Unit (ETU) |accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eight metropolitan municipalities are: [[Buffalo City Local Municipality|Buffalo City]] ([[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]]), [[City of Cape Town]] ([[Cape Town]]), [[Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality|Ekurhuleni]] ([[East Rand]]), [[eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality|eThekwini]] ([[Durban]]), [[City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality|City of Johannesburg]] ([[Johannesburg]]), [[Mangaung Local Municipality|Mangaung]] ([[Bloemfontein]]), [[Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality|Nelson Mandela Bay]] ([[Port Elizabeth]]), and [[City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality|City of Tshwane]] ([[Pretoria]]).&lt;ref name="sainfo-local" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Buffalo City, Mangaung categorised Metros |first=Nthambeleni |last=Gabara |url=http://www.buanews.gov.za/news/10/10120915351002 |work=BuaNews |publisher=Government Communication and Information System |date=9 December 2011 |accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}
==District municipalities==
[[File:Map of South Africa with district borders (2016).svg|thumb|Borders of the district and metropolitan municipalities]]
{{main|District municipality (South Africa)}}
Outside the metropolitan municipalities, the rest of South Africa is divided into 44 district municipalities. These cover large regions of the provinces, and are in turn divided into local municipalities (see below).&lt;ref name="sainfo-local" /&gt; The district municipalities are responsible for "district-wide" municipal functions, including development planning, bulk supply of utilities, arterial roads, and public transport. In district councils, 60% of the councillors are nominated by the councils of the constituent local municipalities, while the remaining 40% are elected by the population by party-list proportional representation.&lt;ref name="etu-electoral" /&gt;

{{clear}}

==Local municipalities==
[[File:Map of South Africa with municipal borders (2016).svg|thumb|right|Borders of the local municipalities]]
{{main|Local municipality (South Africa)}}
The district municipalities are divided into a total of 205 local municipalities. In general, a local municipality includes one or more towns and the surrounding villages and rural areas. A local municipality exercises all the municipal functions not carried out by the district municipality within which it lies. Local municipalities' councils are elected in the same way as those of metropolitan municipalities: half from wards and half by proportional representation.&lt;ref name="etu-electoral" /&gt;

{{clear}}
==Wards==
[[File:South Africa electoral wards 2016 blank.svg|thumb|right|Ward boundaries]]
{{main|Electoral ward (South Africa)}}
Metropolitan and local municipalities are divided into wards, with each ward electing one councillor to the municipal council. {{Asof|2016|08}} there are 4,392 wards in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Marianne |last=Merten |date=2 August 2016 |title=LGE 2016: #Ivoted, the Numbers and the Rules |newspaper=Daily Maverick |url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-08-02-lge-2016-ivoted-the-numbers-and-the-rules/ |accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3503">'''Amin Razi''' also known as ''Omid'') was a [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid-era]] (16th to 17th century) [[Persian people|Persian]]&lt;ref name="Donzel1994"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Donzel|first1=E. J. van|title=Islamic Desk Reference|date=1 January 1994|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-09738-4|page=372|quote=Razi, Amin Ahmad: Persian biographer; xvith c. He owes his fame to a great collection of biographies of famous men, which is arranged geographically according to the seven climes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; geographer,  author of a geographical and biographical encyclopedia (''tadhkirah'')  called '''''Haft iqlīm''''' ({{lang|ar|هفت اقلیم}} "seven climes") based on the system of [[seven climes]] of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]''.

Al-Razi was born in [[Ray, Persia]] into a prestigious family; his father was Kvajeh Mirza Ahmad, the mayor of Ray by appointment of [[Tahmasp I]] (r. 1524&amp;ndash;1576). His paternal uncle was Kvajeh Mohammad Sharif, a poet and minister to the governor of [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] and later to the Shah.

Al-Razi states that he completed his encyclopedia in AH 1002 (1593/4) after six years of work, although the work as extant includes additions of younger date. His dates of birth and death are unknown. He may have visited [[Mughal India]] during the reign of [[Akbar]].&lt;ref&gt;Storey, p. 1169.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Haft iqlīm'' (also ''Haft eqlīm'') provides extensive historical, biographical and topographical information, arranged by "clime", i.e. the major division of the known world by geographic latitude according to Ptolemy.
The total number of biographies in the work is 1,560, in many cases giving more detail than those found in medieval works such as [[Lubab ul-Albab]] or [[Tazkirat al-Awliya]].
The work also cited samples of poetry which is not recorded elsewhere, and some prose passages, e.g. by [[Ubayd Zakani]].

Al-Razi's sources have been researched by Naqawī,&lt;ref&gt;Taḏkera-nevīsī, pp. 118-19&lt;/ref&gt;
who identified thirty-nine. Ethé provides a table of the contents of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Cat. Ind. Off. I, pp. 380-499, no. 724.{{year needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The work survives in numerous manuscripts. The only complete edition is by  Jawād Fāżel (1961). The Calcutta edition by Ross et al. is superior to Fāżel's but is incomplete, omitting the fourth clime (which encompasses more than half of the work).&lt;ref&gt;M. U. Memon (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrew Breeze''' (born 6 July 1954), MA, DipCeltStud, PhD, FSA, FRHistS, has been ''profesor de filología'' at the [[University of Navarra]]&lt;ref name="a_breeze3"&gt;{{citation |title=Andrew Breeze's publications | journal=indexed by [[Google Scholar]]|url=https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=Ub9K79AAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao}}&lt;/ref&gt; since 1987.

== Early life ==
Breeze was educated at [[Sir Roger Manwood's School]], the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]. He is married with six children.

== Work ==
Besides numerous research papers on the philology of multiple Celtic languages, he is the author of the substantial ''Medieval Welsh Literature'' (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Breeze, Andrew, ''Medieval  Welsh  Literature'' (Dublin: Four Courts Press., 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Origins of the "Four Branches of the Mabinogi"'' (2009). He is also co-author with Professor [[Richard Coates]] of ''Celtic Voices, English Places'' (2000).

Breeze is one of the most prolific and varied contributors to Mabinogi Studies, and  ''[[The Mabinogion]]'' research, especially addressing historical and political parallels. In 1997 he published the controversial 'Did a woman write the Four Branches of the Mabinogi?'&lt;ref&gt; 
Breeze, Andrew Charles, ''Studi Medievali'', Vol. 38, 2, pp. 679-705.&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Roger Dobson, ''Is this Welsh princess the first British woman author?', ''The Independent'', 11 Jan. 1997. [http://=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/is-this-welsh-princess-the-first-british-woman-author-1282555.html The Independent]&lt;/ref&gt; proposing a woman composer for this leading literature of British/ Welsh heritage.  Breeze's theory rests on the unusual lack of warlike or fighting heroics compared to preceding literature; the high quantity of material on mothering, besides complex, in depth portraits of Mabinogi women.&lt;ref&gt;There is an interesting study of ''Mabinogi'' women, with conclusions very different from those reached by Breeze, in Roberta Valente's ''‘"Merched y Mabinogi": Women and the Thematic Structure of the Four Branches’'' (unpub. PhD thesis, Cornell University, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; This much has been supported or tolerated by some scholars, but there has been much less approval of Breeze's preferred candidate [[Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd]]. Since the 1997 article Breeze has been persistent in further publications on the idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mabinogistudy.com The Mabinogi Bibliography] holds 24 Breeze entries, where most scholars have 5 or less.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, he published a paper identifying the locations of [[King Arthur]]'s battles from the 9th-century ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', placing them all in Scotland and Northern England, with the exception of [[Mount Badon]] in the year 493, located at a hillfort east of [[Braydon Forest]], [[Wiltshire]], but having nothing to do with Arthur. Using these identifications, he suggested that Arthur was a [[Celtic Britons|Briton]] from the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] who fought other Britons, rather than [[Anglo-Saxons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = King Arthur?

The park is named for Spanish settler, Augustin Bernal,to whom the land on which the park sits, was originally granted.&lt;ref name = "Bernal map"/&gt;

Access to the park's public staging area is through a [[gated community]], Golden Eagle Farms.  Pleasanton residents can show proof of residency to get past the community's gate at Golden Eagle Way and Foothill Road; non-residents can obtain a one-week permit at Pleasanton's Department of Parks and Community Services.&lt;ref name="wcpcusrpat"/&gt; The Community Services office is at 200 Old Bernal Ave. in Pleasanton.&lt;ref name ="Trailstompers"&gt;[http://www.trailstompers.com/pleasanton-ridge-regional-park-and-augustin-bernal-community-park-trail-runs.html "Pleasanton Ridge Regional Park (and Augustin Bernal Community Park).

The '''axis mundi''' (also '''cosmic axis''', '''world axis''', '''world pillar''', '''center of the world''', '''world tree'''), in certain beliefs and philosophies, is the world center, or the connection between [[Heaven]] and [[Earth]]. As the [[celestial pole]] and [[geographic pole]], it expresses a point of connection between sky and earth where the four compass directions meet. At this point travel and correspondence is made between higher and lower realms.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.48-51&lt;/ref&gt; Communication from lower realms may ascend to higher ones and blessings from higher realms may descend to lower ones and be disseminated to all.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.40&lt;/ref&gt; The spot functions as the ''[[omphalos]]'' (navel), the world's point of beginning.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Cooper. ''An Illustrated Encyclopedia of Traditional Symbols.'' Thames and Hudson: New York, 1978. {{ISBN|0500271259}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Willard Trask). 'Archetypes and Repetition' in ''The Myth of the Eternal Return. Princeton, 1971. {{ISBN|0691017778}}. p.16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winther, Rasmus Grønfeldt (2014) World Navels. ''Cartouche'' 89: 15-21 http://philpapers.org/archive/WINWN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The image relates to the center of the earth (perhaps like an [[umbilical cord|umbilical]] providing nourishment){{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}. It may have the form of a natural object (a [[mountain]], a [[tree]], a [[vine]], a [[Plant stem|stalk]], a column of [[smoke]] or [[fire]]) or a product of human manufacture (a staff, a [[tower]], a [[ladder]], a [[staircase]], a [[maypole]], a [[cross]], a [[steeple (architecture)|steeple]], a [[rope]], a [[totem pole]], a [[Column|pillar]], a [[spire]]). Its proximity to heaven may carry implications that are chiefly religious ([[pagoda]], [[temple mount]], [[minaret]], [[church (building)|church]]) or secular ([[obelisk]], [[lighthouse]], [[rocket]], [[skyscraper]]). The image appears in religious and secular contexts.&lt;ref name="Alain Gheerbrandt 1982. pp.61-63"&gt;[[Jean Chevalier (writer)|Jean Chevalier]] and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.61-63, 173-175&lt;/ref&gt; The ''axis mundi'' symbol may be found in cultures utilizing [[shamanism|shamanic]] practices or [[animism|animist]] belief systems, in major world religions, and in technologically advanced "urban centers". In [[Mircea Eliade]]'s opinion, "Every Microcosm, every inhabited region, has a Centre; that is to say, a place that is sacred above all."&lt;ref name="Mircea Eliade 1991. p.39"&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.39&lt;/ref&gt; The axis mundi is often associated with [[mandalas]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Background==
[[File:FujiSunriseKawaguchiko2025WP.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Mount Fuji]], [[Japan]]]]
The symbol originates in a natural and universal psychological perception: that the spot one occupies stands at "the center of the world". This space serves as a microcosm of order because it is known and settled. Outside the boundaries of the microcosm lie foreign realms that, because they are unfamiliar or not ordered, represent chaos, death or night.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.37-39&lt;/ref&gt; From the center one may still venture in any of the four cardinal directions, make discoveries, and establish new centers as new realms become known and settled. The name of [[China]], meaning "Middle Nation" ({{lang|zh|中国}} [[pinyin]]: ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|Zhōngguó}}''), is often interpreted as an expression of an ancient perception that the Chinese polity (or group of polities) occupied the center of the world, with other lands lying in various directions relative to it.&lt;ref name="Alain Gheerbrandt 1982. pp.61-63"/&gt;

Within the central known universe a specific locale-often a mountain or other elevated place, a spot where earth and sky come closest gains status as center of the center, the '''axis mundi'''. High mountains are typically regarded as sacred by peoples living near them. Shrines are often erected at the summit or base.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.41-43&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Mount Kunlun]] fills a similar role in China.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Chong. ''Lunheng Part I: Philosophical Essays of Wang Ch'ung''. Trans. Alfred Forke. London: Luzac &amp; Co., 1907. p.337.&lt;/ref&gt; For the ancient Hebrews [[Mount Zion]] expressed the symbol.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Sioux]] beliefs take the [[Black Hills]] as the axis mundi.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Mount Kailash]] is holy to [[Hinduism]] and several religions in [[Tibet]]. The [[Pitjantjatjara people|Pitjantjatjara]] people in central Australia consider [[Uluru]] to be central to both their world and culture. In ancient [[Mesopotamia]] the cultures of ancient [[Sumer]] and [[Babylon]] erected artificial mountains, or [[ziggurat]]s, on the flat river plain. These supported staircases leading to temples at the top. The Hindu temples in India are often situated on high mountains. E.g. [[Amarnath Temple|Amarnath]], [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple|Tirupati]], [[Vaishno Devi]] etc. The pre-Columbian residents of [[Teotihuacán]] in [[Mexico]] erected huge [[pyramid]]s featuring staircases leading to heaven. These [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] temples were often placed on top of caves or subterranean springs, which were thought to be openings to the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art of Colonial Latin America|last=Bailey|first=Gauvin Alexander|publisher=Phaidon Press Limited|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York (NY)|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob's Ladder]] is an axis mundi image, as is the [[Temple Mount]]. For Christians the [[Cross]] on Mount [[Calvary]] expresses the symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.680-685&lt;/ref&gt; The Middle Kingdom, China, had a central mountain, [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun]], known in [[Taoism|Taoist literature]] as "the mountain at the middle of the world." To "go into the mountains" meant to dedicate oneself to a spiritual life.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.681&lt;/ref&gt; Monasteries of all faiths tend, like shrines, to be placed at elevated spots. Wise religious teachers are typically depicted in literature and art as bringing their revelations at world centers: mountains, trees, temples.

Because the axis mundi is an idea that unites a number of concrete images, no contradiction exists in regarding multiple spots as "the center of the world". The symbol can operate in a number of locales at once.&lt;ref name="Mircea Eliade 1991. p.39"/&gt; [[Mount Hermon]] was regarded as the axis mundi in [[Caananite]] tradition, from where the sons of God are introduced descending in [[1 Enoch]] (1En6:6).&lt;ref name="Bautch2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kelley Coblentz Bautch|title=A Study of the Geography of 1 Enoch 17-19: "no One Has Seen what I Have Seen"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3FPNFEtWNrQC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=28 June 2011|date=25 September 2003|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-13103-3|pages=62–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Urartu|ancient Armenians]] had a number of holy sites, the most important of which was [[Mount Ararat]], which was thought to be the home of the gods as well as the center of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peopleofar.com/2013/08/11/noahs-ark-in-the-mountains-of-armenia/&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] regarded several sites as places of earth's ''[[omphalos]]'' (navel) stone, notably the oracle at [[Delphi]], while still maintaining a belief in a cosmic [[world tree]] and in [[Mount Olympus]] as the abode of the gods. Judaism has the [[Temple Mount]], Christianity has the [[Mount of Olives]] and [[Calvary]], Islam has [[Ka'aba]], said to be the first building on earth, and the [[Temple Mount]] ([[Dome of the Rock]]).  In [[Hinduism]], [[Mount Kailash]] is identified with the mythical [[Mount Meru]] and regarded as the home of [[Shiva]]; in [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], Mount Kailash is recognized as the most sacred place where all the [[Ley line|dragon currents]] converge and is regarded as the gateway to [[Shambhala]].  In [[Shinto]], the [[Ise Shrine]] is the omphalos.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}  In addition to the [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun Mountains]], where it is believed the [[peach tree of immortality]] is located, the [[Chinese folk religion]] recognizes four other specific mountains as pillars of the world.

Sacred places constitute world centers ([[omphalos]]) with the [[altar]] or place of prayer as the axis. Altars, incense sticks, candles and torches form the axis by sending a column of smoke, and prayer, toward heaven. The architecture of sacred places often reflects this role. "Every temple or palace--and by extension, every sacred city or royal residence--is a Sacred Mountain, thus becoming a Centre."&lt;ref name="Mircea Eliade 1971. p.12"&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Willard Trask). 'Archetypes and Repetition' in ''The Myth of the Eternal Return. Princeton, 1971. {{ISBN|0691017778}}. p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The [[stupa]] of [[Hinduism]], and later [[Buddhism]], reflects [[Mount Meru]]. Cathedrals are laid out in the form of a [[cross]], with the vertical bar representing the union of earth and heaven as the horizontal bars represent union of people to one another, with the altar at the intersection. [[Pagoda]] structures in Asian temples take the form of a stairway linking earth and heaven. A [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]] in a church or a [[minaret]] in a mosque also serve as connections of earth and heaven. Structures such as the [[maypole]], derived from the [[Saxons]]' [[Irminsul]], and the [[totem pole]] among [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] also represent world axes. The [[calumet (pipe)|calumet]], or sacred pipe, represents a column of smoke (the soul) rising form a world center.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.148-149&lt;/ref&gt; A [[mandala]] creates a world center within the boundaries of its two-dimensional space analogous to that created in three-dimensional space by a shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.52-54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Yggdrasil]], the World Ash in Norse myths]]

===Plants===
Plants often serve as images of the axis mundi. The image of the [[Cosmic Tree]] provides an axis symbol that unites three planes: sky (branches), earth (trunk) and underworld (roots).&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.42-45&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[Pacific island]] cultures the [[banyan]] tree, of which the [[Bodhi tree]] is of the [[Sacred Fig]] variety, is the abode of ancestor spirits. In Hindu religion, the banyan tree is considered sacred and is called ''ashwath vriksha'' ("I am banyan tree among trees" - ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''). It represents eternal life because of its seemingly ever-expanding branches.  The Bodhi tree is also the name given to the tree under which [[Gautama Siddhartha]], the historical [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], sat on the night he attained [[Bodhi|enlightenment]]. The [[Yggdrasil]], or World Ash, functions in much the same way in [[Norse mythology]]; it is the site where [[Odin]] found enlightenment. Other examples include [[Jievaras]] in [[Lithuanian mythology]] and [[Thor's Oak]] in the myths of the pre-Christian [[Germanic peoples]]. The [[Tree of Life]] and the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]] in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] present two aspects of the same image. Each is said to stand at the center of the [[Garden of Eden|Paradise garden]] from which four rivers flow to nourish the whole world. Each tree confers a boon. [[Bamboo]], the plant from which Asian calligraphy pens are made, represents knowledge and is regularly found on Asian college campuses. The [[Christmas tree]], which can be traced in its origins back to pre-Christian [[Europe]]an beliefs, represents an axis mundi.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Chevalier, Jean and Gheerbrandt, Alain. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.1025-1033&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify span|[[Entheogen]]s (psychoactive substances) are often{{who|date=November 2012}} regarded as world axes|date=November 2012}}, such as the [[Fly Agaric]] mushroom among the [[Evenks]] of [[Russia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} In China, traditional cosmography sometimes depicts the world center marked with the Jian tree ({{lang|zh|建木}}). Two more trees are placed at the East and West, corresponding to the points of sunrise and sunset, as described in the ''[[Huainanzi]]''. The [[Mesoamerican world tree]] connects the planes of the Underworld and the sky with that of the terrestrial realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Mary  |authorlink=Mary Miller (art historian) |author2=[[Karl Taube]]  |year=1993 |title=The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |page=186|isbn=0500050686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (c. 1492)]]

===Human figure===
The human body can express the symbol of world axis.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.54&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more abstract Tree of Life representations, such as the ''[[sefirot]]'' in [[Kabbalism]] and in the ''[[chakra]]'' system recognized by Hinduism and Buddhism, merge with the concept of the human body as a pillar between heaven and earth. Disciplines such as [[yoga]] and [[tai chi]] begin from the premise of the human body as axis mundi. The Buddha represents a world centre in human form.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Indian Symbolisms of Time and Eternity' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.76&lt;/ref&gt; Large statues of a meditating figure unite the human figure with the symbolism of temple and tower. [[Astrology]] in all its forms assumes a connection between human health and affairs and the orientation of these with celestial bodies. World religions regard the body itself as a temple and prayer as a column uniting earth to heaven. The ancient [[Colossus of Rhodes]] combined the role of human figure with those of portal and skyscraper. The image of a human being suspended on a tree or a cross locates the figure at the axis where heaven and earth meet. The Renaissance image known as the [[Vitruvian Man]] represented a symbolic and mathematical exploration of the human form as world axis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Homes===
Homes can represent world centers. The symbolism for their residents is the same as for inhabitants of palaces and other sacred mountains.&lt;ref name="Mircea Eliade 1971. p.12"/&gt; The hearth participates in the symbolism of the [[altar]] and a central [[garden]] participates in the symbolism of primordial [[Garden of Eden|paradise]]. In Asian cultures houses were traditionally laid out in the form of a square oriented toward the four compass directions. A traditional Asian home was oriented toward the sky through [[feng shui]], a system of [[geomancy]], just as a palace would be. Traditional Arab houses are also laid out as a square surrounding a central fountain that evokes a primordial garden paradise. Mircea Eliade noted that "the symbolism of the pillar in [European] peasant houses likewise derives from the 'symbolic field' of the ''axis mundi''. In many archaic dwellings the central pillar does in fact serve as a means of communication with the heavens, with the sky."&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade. 'Brâncuși and Mythology' in ''Symbolism, the Sacred, and the Arts. Continuum, 1992. {{ISBN|0826406181}}. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  The nomadic peoples of Mongolia and the Americas more often lived in circular structures. The central pole of the tent still operated as an axis but a fixed reference to the four compass points was avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.529-531&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caduceus large.jpg|thumb|110px|right|The [[caduceus]]]]

===Shamanic function===
A common [[shamanism|shamanic]] concept, and a universally told story, is that of the healer traversing the axis mundi to bring back knowledge from the other world. It may be seen in the stories from [[Odin]] and the [[Yggdrasil|World Ash Tree]] to [[the Garden of Eden]] and [[Jacob's Ladder]] to [[Jack and the Beanstalk]] and [[Rapunzel]]. It is the essence of the journey described in ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' by [[Dante Alighieri]]. The epic poem relates its hero's descent and ascent through a series of spiral structures that take him from through the core of the earth, from the depths of Hell to celestial Paradise.
It is also a central tenet in the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  last = Townsend | first = Richard F. |  title = [[Hero, Hawk, and Open Hand]]| publisher = [[Yale University Press]] | year = 2004 |  isbn = 0-300-10601-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone or anything suspended on the axis between heaven and earth becomes a repository of potential knowledge. A special status accrues to the thing suspended: a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], a victim of crucifixion or hanging, a rod, a fruit, [[mistletoe]]. Derivations of this idea find form in the [[Rod of Asclepius]], an emblem of the medical profession, and in the [[caduceus]], an emblem of correspondence and commercial professions. The staff in these emblems represents the axis mundi while the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpents]] act as guardians of, or guides to, knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.142-145&lt;/ref&gt;

Axis mundi symbolism continues to be evoked, even in modern societies, through various art forms and has a deep rooted spiritual inspiration that transcends time.

The idea has proven consequential in the realm of [[architecture]].  Structures that have a spiritual meaning, that inspire and create a connection between the spiritual world and the physical world, that are erected as monuments to commemorate are achievements can be considered to be inspired by the axis mundi. The pyramids that have been erected throughout human history serve as perfect examples of axis mundi.  A [[skyscraper]], as the term itself suggests, suggests the connection of earth and sky, as do [[spire]] structures of all sorts. Such buildings come to be regarded as "centers" of an inhabited area, or even the world, and serve as icons of its ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Dupré. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.' Black Dog &amp; Leventhal, 1998/2008. p.137&lt;/ref&gt; The first skyscraper of modern times, the [[Eiffel Tower]], exemplifies this role. The structure was erected in 1889 in [[Paris]], [[France]], to serve as the centerpiece for the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]], making it a symbolic world center from the planning stages. It has served as an iconic image for the city and the nation ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Dupré. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.' Black Dog &amp; Leventhal, 1998/2008. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Landmark skyscrapers often take names that clearly identify them as centers.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Dupré. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.' Black Dog &amp; Leventhal, 1998/2008. pp. 45, 69, 81, 91, 97,135, 136, 143&lt;/ref&gt; 

Artistic representations of the axis mundi are plentiful. Just one example of these is the ''Colonne sans fin'' (''[[The Endless Column]]'', 1938) an abstract [[sculpture]] by Romanian [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. The column takes the form of a "sky pillar" ({{lang|ro|{{vanchor|columna cerului}}}}) upholding the heavens even as its rhythmically repeating segments invite climb and suggest the possibility of ascension.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade. 'Brâncuși and Mythology' in ''Symbolism, the Sacred, and the Arts. Continuum, 1992. {{ISBN|0826406181}}. p.99-100&lt;/ref&gt;

Visual representation of the axis mundi in contemporary art is currently being achieved by photographer Jennifer Westjohn.  By the process of mirror symmetry of a single photograph the artist exposes an entirely new image: the 5th point.  The viewer is then introduced to a coalescing of nature and the universe which lends new perspective to the original image.  This artistic representation of axis mundi opens the mind up to a new visual dimension both energistic and shamanic.&lt;ref&gt; Jennifer Westjohn. Photographer. "jenniferwestjohn.com" "the5thpoint.com" 2013-2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bolting''' is the production of a flowering stem (or stems) on agricultural and horticultural [[crop]]s before the crop is harvested, in a natural attempt to produce seeds&lt;ref name=Buczacki&gt;{{cite book|title=Pests, Diseases &amp; Disorders of Garden Plants|author=Stefan Buczacki &amp; Keith Harris|publisher=Collins|pages=604–5|ISBN=0 00 220063 5|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[plant  reproduction|reproduce]]. These flowering stems are usually vigorous extensions of existing leaf-bearing stems, and in order to produce them, a plant diverts resources away from producing the edible parts such as leaves or roots, resulting in a poor quality harvest. Plants that have produced flowering stems in this way are said to have '''bolted'''. Crops inclined to bolt include [[lettuce]], [[basil]], [[beetroot]], [[brassicas]], [[spinach]], [[celery]], [[onion]],&lt;ref name=Buczacki /&gt; and [[leek]].&lt;ref name="RHS website"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bolting in vegetables |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=262 |publisher=The Royal Horticultural Society 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolting is induced by plant hormones of the [[gibberellin]] family,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} and can occur as a result of several factors, including changes in day length, the prevalence of high temperatures at particular stages in a plant's growth cycle, and the existence of stresses such as insufficient water or minerals. These factors may interact in a complex way.&lt;ref name=Buczacki /&gt; Day length may affect the propensity to bolt in that some plants are "long day plants", some are "short day plants" and some are "day neutral" (see [[Photoperiodism]]), so for example when a long day plant, such as spinach, experiences increasingly long days that reach a particular length, it will be inclined to bolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zeevaart | first1 = J. A. D. | title = Effects of Photoperiod on Growth Rate and Endogenous Gibberellins in the Long-Day Rosette Plant Spinach | doi = 10.1104/pp.47.6.821 | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 821–827 | year = 1971 | pmid =  16657712| pmc =396778 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Low or high temperatures can affect the propensity of some plants to bolt if they are experienced for sufficient periods at particular points in the life cycle of the plant; once these conditions have been met, plants that require such a trigger will subsequently bolt regardless of subsequent temperatures.&lt;ref name=Buczacki /&gt; Plants under stress may respond by bolting so that they can produce seeds before they die.

Plant breeders have introduced [[cultivar]]s of bolt-prone crops that are less prone to the condition.&lt;ref name=Buczacki /&gt;

A '''breast-shaped hill''' is a mountain in the shape of a woman's [[breast]]. Some such hills are named "[[wikt:pap#Etymology 2|Pap]]", a word for the breast or nipple. Such anthropomorphic geographic features are to be found in different places of the world and in some cultures they were revered as the attributes of the [[Mother Goddess]], such as the [[Paps of Anu]], named after [[Anu (goddess)|Anu]], an important female deity of pre-Christian [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scoilnet.ie/womeninhistory/content/unit1/female.html |title=The feminine in early Irish myth and legend |publisher=Scoilnet |accessdate=4 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054430/http://www.scoilnet.ie/womeninhistory/content/unit1/female.html |archivedate=11 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing by [[Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent]].]]
The name ''[[Mamucium]]'' that gave origin to the name of the city of [[Manchester]] is thought to derive from the [[Celtic language]] meaning "breast-shaped hill", referring to the sandstone bluff on which the fort stood; this later evolved into the name Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of British Place-Names|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/pages/Subjects_and_Titles__2B_05|last=Mills|first=A.D.|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-852758-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hylton (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mostly breast-shaped hills are connected with local ancestral veneration of the breast as a [[symbol of fertility]] and well-being. It is not uncommon for very old [[archaeological site]]s to be located in or below such hills, as on [[Samson, Isles of Scilly]], where there are large ancient [[burial]] grounds both on the North Hill and South Hill,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=7617 Samson, South Hill Chambered Cairn - The Megalithic Portal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=6333306 Samson, North Hill - The Megalithic Portal]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Burrén and Burrena]], [[Aragon]], [[Spain]], where two [[Iron Age]] [[Urnfield culture]] archaeological sites lie beneath the hills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rutadelagarnacha.blogspot.com/2010/07/burren-parque-arqueologico-de-la.html Burrén. Parque Arqueológico de la Primera Edad del Hierro en Frescano]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Hills on Mykonos.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The "Breasts of Aphrodite" in [[Mykonos]], [[Greece]].]]
Also the myths surrounding these mountains are ancient and enduring and some have been recorded in the [[oral literature]] or written texts; for example, in an unspecified location in Asia, there was a mountain known as "Breast Mountain" with a cave in which the [[Buddhist monk]] [[Bodhidharma]] (Da Mo) spent a long time in [[meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usashaolintemple.org/chanbuddhism-history/ |title=The Story of Bodhidharma|publisher=USA Shaolin Temple |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travelers and cartographers in colonial times often changed the ancestral names of such hills. The mountain known as "Didhol" or "Dithol", Woman's Breast, by the [[Indigenous Australian]] people, was rechristened [[Pigeon House Mountain]] by Captain [[James Cook]] at the time of his exploration of [[Australia]]'s eastern coast in 1770.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

"Mamelon" (from French "nipple") is a French name for a breast-shaped hillock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tmKPXhfkzgMC&amp;pg=PA936 |page=936 |title=Dictionnaire Du Petrole Et Autres Sources D'Energie: Anglais-Franncais, Francais-Anglais |trans-title=Comprehensive Dictionary of Petroleum and Other Energy Sources |last1=Moureau |first1=M. |last2=Brace |first2=G. |publisher=Editions Technip |date=January 2008 |accessdate=4 April 2011 |isbn=2-7108-0911-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mamelon (fort)|Fort Mamelon]] was a famous hillock fortified by the Russians and captured by the French as part of the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)|Siege of Sevastopol]] during the [[Crimean War]] of the 1850s. The word "[[Mamelon (volcanology)|mamelon]]" is also used in [[volcanology]] to describe a particular rock formation of [[volcanic]] origin. The term was coined by the [[France|French]] explorer and naturalist [[Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dominique.decobecq.perso.neuf.fr/Dolomieu%20histoire.html |title=L'histoire du cratère Dolomieu (Piton de la Fournaise) |first=Dominique |last=Decobecq |language=French |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Circumferentor at campus martius.JPG|thumb|Circumferentor with [[Gunter's chain]] at [[Campus Martius Museum]] in [[Marietta, Ohio]]]]
A '''circumferentor''', or '''surveyor's compass''', is an instrument used in [[surveying]] to measure horizontal angles. It was superseded by the [[theodolite]] in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=|title=Scientific Instruments, 1500-1900: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ThXH7xmUskIC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=3 July 2014|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-21728-7|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A circumferentor consists of a circular [[brass]] box containing a magnetic needle, which moves freely over a brass circle, or [[compass]] divided into 360 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]].&lt;ref name="Turner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nesbit"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nesbit|first1=Anthony |last2=Baker|first2=Thomas |title=A complete Treatise on practical Land-Surveying, etc. With an engraved "Field-Book," being the notes on an estate in the Parish of Preston|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RIFaAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA343|accessdate=3 July 2014|year=1855|pages=343–344}}&lt;/ref&gt; The needle is protected by a glass covering. &lt;ref name="Nesbit"/&gt; A pair of [[Sight (device)|sights]] is located on the North-South axis of the compass.&lt;ref name="Turner"/&gt; Circumferentors were typically mounted on [[tripod]]s and rotated on [[ball-and-socket joint]]s.&lt;ref name="Nesbit"/&gt;

Circumferentors were made throughout Europe, including in England, France, Italy, and Holland. By the early 19th century, Europeans preferred theodolites to circumferentors. However, the circumferentor remained in common use in [[Mining|mines]] and in wooded or uncleared areas, such as in America.&lt;ref name="Turner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nesbit"/&gt;

==Usage==
[[Image:Open angle with letters.svg|thumb|right|Figure 1: Angle EKG]]
[[Image:Figure 21, Table of Surveying, Cyclopaedia, Volume 2.jpg|frame|right|Figure 2: Region ABCDEFGHK]]

===Measuring angles===
To measure an angle with a circumferentor, such as angle EKG (Figure 1), place the instrument at K, with the [[fleur-de-lis]] in the card towards you. Then direct the sights, until through them you see E; and note the degree pointed at by the south end of the needle, such as 296°. Then, turn the instrument around, with the fleur-de-lis still towards you, and direct the sights to G; note the degree at which the south end of the needle point, such as 182°. Finally, subtract the lesser number, 182, from the greater, 296°; the remainder, 114°, is the number of degrees in the angle EKG.

If the remainder is more than 180 degrees, it must be subtracted from 360 degrees.

===Surveying a region===

To take the plot of a field, forest, park, etc., with a circumferentor, consider region ABCDEFGHK in Figure 2, an area to be surveyed.

#Placing the instrument at A, the fleur-de-lis towards you, direct the sights to B; where suppose the south end of the needle cuts 191°; and the ditch, wall, or hedge, measuring with a [[Gunter's chain]], contains 10 chains, 75 links.
#Placing the instrument at B, direct the sights as before to C; the south end of the needle, ''e.g.'' will cut 279°; and the line BC contains 6 chains and 83 links.

Then move the instrument to C; turn the sights to measure D, and measure CD as before. In the same manner, proceed to D, E, F, G, H, and lastly to K; still noting the degrees of every bearing, or angle, and the distances of every side. This will result in a table of the following form:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:auto;"
!Station
!Degrees
!Min.
!Chains
!Link
|-
|A
|191
|00
|10
|75
|-
|B
|297
|00
|6
|83
|-
|C
|216
|30
|7
|82
|-
| colspan="5"|etc.
|}

From this table, the field is to be plotted, or protracted.

Alternative plotting method:

An alternative way to plot the area in Figure 2 is to use several angles and only a few measurements and calculate their positions. 

This could be done by starting at the center point in Figure 2 which is not labeled, but which will be referred to as "Center." Assume each point can be seen from each other point. From the "center" point, sight and record the angle to each point using the sights as described above. Then move to, and measure the distance to, one of the other points referenced, such as point B. At point B, measure the angles to all the other points. Then, move to an additional point such as point F. Again, measure the distance from the center to the point chosen (F). At that point, measure and record the angles to each of the other points as was done at point B. Chose a scale (a ratio between the size of the area to be plotted and the size of the paper on which you will draw the plot) that will allow the plot to fit on your paper and plot the angles and distances.

The advantage of this method over the first one above is that there are fewer distance measurements and any errors in angles or distances will not be cumulative; that is, if you use the first survey method, any angle that is slightly off will distort the remainder of the plot. The second method can also be used when it is not possible to measure some of the distances, for example, if there is a water barrier between two of the points. Also, if there are any inaccuracies in the measurements, they will be revealed in the plot because the points plotted from various angles will not coincide.

Additional considerations include the number of times the circumferentor must be set up and aligned. With the first method, the instrument must be set up at each point with a compass. With the second method, the initial set up is at "center." After that, for example at point B, the instrument can be set up by aligning the sight with the reciprocal of the angle between "center" and B. Thus, any local change in the magnetic field that would affect the compass would be nullified.

==Surveyor's double prism==

[[Image:Doppelpenta.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Double prism as used in surveying.]]

A double prism is a device to measure right angles, consisting of two five sided prisms stacked on top of each other and a [[plumb-bob]]. It is used to stake out [[right angle]]s, for example on a [[construction]] site.

The '''deportation of Armenian intellectuals''', sometimes known as '''Red Sunday''' ([[Western Armenian|Western]] {{lang-hy|Կարմիր կիրակի}} ''Garmir giragi{{#tag:ref| The [[Eastern Armenian]] pronunciation is transliterated as ''Karmir kiraki''|group="n"}}''), was the first major event of the [[Armenian Genocide]]. Leaders of the Armenian community in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] capital of [[Constantinople]], and later other locations, were arrested and moved to two holding centers near [[Ankara]]. The [[s:Circular on April 24, 1915|order]] to do so was given by Minister of the Interior [[Talaat Pasha]] on 24 April 1915. On that night, the first wave of 235 to 270 Armenian intellectuals of Constantinople were arrested. Eventually, the total number of arrests and deportations amounted to 2,345. With the adoption of the [[Tehcir Law]] on 29 May 1915, these detainees were later relocated within the [[Ottoman Empire]]; most of them were ultimately killed. A few, such as [[Vrtanes Papazian]] and [[Komitas]], were saved through intervention.

The event has been described by historians as a [[decapitation strike]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blinka|first=David S.|title=Re-creating Armenia: America and the memory of the Armenian genocide|date=2008|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison|page=31|quote=In what scholars commonly refer to as the decapitation strike on April 24, 1915...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloxham|first1=Donald|authorlink1=Donald Bloxham|title=The Great Game of Genocide: Imperialism, Nationalism, and the Destruction of the Ottoman Armenians|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=70|quote=...the decapitation of the Armenian nation with the series of mass arrests that began on 24 April...}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was intended to deprive the Armenian population of leadership and a chance for resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sahаkian|first=T.

First observed in 1919 on the four-year anniversary of the events in Constantinople, the date is generally considered the date on which the genocide began. The Armenian Genocide has since been commemorated annually on the same day, which has become a national holiday in [[Armenia]] and the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]] and is observed by the [[Armenian diaspora]] around the world.

===Detention===
The Ottoman Minister of the Interior [[Talaat Pasha]] gave the detention order on 24 April 1915. The operation commenced at 8 p.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

There were further deportations from the capital. The first task was to identify those imprisoned. They were held for one day in a police station (Ottoman Turkish: ''Emniyeti Umumiye'') and the Central Prison. A second wave brought the figure to between 500 and 600.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;{{sfn|Der Yeghiayan|2002|p=63}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Panossian|first= Razmik|title=The Armenians.

By the end of August 1915, about 150 Armenians with Russian citizenship were deported from Constantinople to holding centers.&lt;ref name="teodar16"&gt;

After the passage of [[Tehcir Law]] on 29 May 1915, Armenians left at the two holding centers were deported to [[Ottoman Syria]]. Most of the arrested were transferred from Central Prison over Saray Burnu by steamer No. 67 of the Şirket company to the [[Haydarpaşa Terminal|Haydarpaşa train station]]. After waiting for ten hours, they were sent by special train in the direction of [[Ankara]] the next day. The entire convoy consisted of 220 Armenians.&lt;ref name="Nakashian"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nakashian|first1=Avedis|last2=Rouben Mamoulian Collection (Library of Congress)|title=A Man Who Found A Country|publisher=Thomas Y.

It was handed over to the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, [[Zaven Der Yeghiayan]], who immediately tried in vain to save as many deportees as possible. The only foreign ambassador to help him in his efforts was US ambassador [[Henry Morgenthau, Sr.|Henry Morgenthau]].{{sfn|Der Yeghiayan|2002|p=58}} After a train journey of 20 hours, the deportees got off in Sincanköy (near Ankara) Tuesday noon. At the station Ibrahim, the director of the Central Prison of Constantinople, did the triage. The deportees were divided into two groups.

One group was sent to [[Çankırı]] (and Çorum between Çankırı and [[Amasya]]) and the other to [[Ayaş]]. Those separated for Ayaş were transported in carts for a couple of hours further to Ayaş. Almost all of them were killed several months later in gorges near Ankara.&lt;ref name="Bal95"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palak'ean|first1=Grigoris|authorlink=Krikor Balakian|title=Le Golgotha arménien: de Berlin à Deir-es-Zor|language=fr|publisher=Le Cerle d'Écrits Caucasiens|location=La Ferté-sous-Jouarre|year=2002|volume=1|isbn=978-2-913564-08-4|oclc=163168810|pages=95–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 10 (or 13)&lt;ref name="Yve27" /&gt; deportees of this group were granted permission to return to Constantinople from Ayaş.{{#tag:ref|According to [[Teotig]]'s year book 1916–20 these were: Dikran Ajemian, Mkrtich Garabedian, H.

===Court martial===
Some notables such as Dr. [[Nazaret Daghavarian]] and [[Sarkis Minassian]] were removed on 5 May from the Ayaş prison and taken under military escort to Diyarbakır along with [[Harutiun Jangülian]], [[Karekin Khajag]], and [[Rupen Zartarian]] to appear before a court martial. They were, seemingly, murdered by state-sponsored paramilitary groups led by [[Cherkes Ahmet]], and lieutenants Halil and Nazım, at a locality called Karacaören shortly before arriving at Diyarbakır.&lt;ref name="c-khachig" /&gt; Marzbed, another deportee, was dispatched to Kayseri to appear before a court martial on 18 May 1915.&lt;ref name="Bal87"&gt;{{cite book|title=Le Golgotha arménien : de Berlin à Deir-es-Zor|publisher=Le Cerle d'Écrits Caucasiens|year=2002|isbn=978-2-913564-08-4|volume=1|location=[[La Ferté-sous-Jouarre]]|pages=87–94|language=French|oclc=163168810|last1=Palak'ean|first1=Grigoris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The militants responsible for the murders were tried and executed in Damascus by [[Djemal Pasha]] in September 1915; the incident later became the subject of a 1916 investigation by the [[Ottoman Parliament]] led by [[Artin Boshgezenian]], the deputy for Aleppo. After Marzbed's release from the court, he worked under a false Ottoman identity for the Germans in Intilli (Amanus railway tunnel). He escaped to Nusaybin, where he fell from a horse and died shortly before the armistice.&lt;ref name="Bal87"  /&gt;

===Release===
Several prisoners were released with the help of various influential people intervening on their behalf.{{sfn|Der Yeghiayan|2002|p=66}} Five deportees from Çankırı were freed upon the intervention of the United States ambassador [[Henry Morgenthau, Sr.|Henry Morgenthau]].&lt;ref name="Yve27" /&gt; In total, 12 deportees were granted permission to return to Constantinople from Çankırı.{{#tag:ref|According to [[Teotig]]'s year book 1916–20 these were: Dikran Ajemian, Mkrtich Garabedian, H.

===Survivors===
After the [[Armistice of Mudros]] (30 October 1918), several surviving Armenian intellectuals came back to Constantinople, which was under an [[Occupation of Constantinople|allied occupation]]. They started a short, but intense, literary activity that was ended by the Turkish victory in 1923. Those who have written memoirs and books about their accounts during the deportation include [[Grigoris Balakian]], [[Aram Andonian]], [[Yervant Odian]], [[Teotig]], and Mikayel Shamtanchyan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Odian|first=Yervant|title=Accursed years : my exile and return from Der Zor, 1914–1919|year=2009|publisher=[[Gomidas Institute]]|location=London|isbn=1-903656-84-2|page=x|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NJYtAQAAIAAJ|editor=Krikor Beledian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other survivors, such as [[Komitas]], developed serious cases of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].

==Day of remembrance==
[[File:Armenian intellectuals deported on 24 April 1915.jpg|thumb|An exhibition dedicated to the deported intellectuals at the [[Tsitsernakaberd|genocide museum]] in Yerevan.]]
The official date of remembrance for the Armenian Genocide is 24 April, the day that marked the beginning of the deportation of Armenian intellectuals. The first commemoration, organized by a group of Armenian Genocide survivors, was held in Istanbul in 1919 at the local St. Trinity Armenian church. Many prominent figures in the Armenian community participated in the commemoration. Following its initial commemoration in 1919, the date became the annual day of remembrance for the Armenian Genocide.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/31.03.2009.php|title=At the Origins of Commemoration: The 90th Anniversary Declaring April 24 as a Day of Mourning and Commemoration of the Armenian Genocide|date=10 March 2009|publisher=Armenian Genocide Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable deportees==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5332">[[File:Stash pic jason crouch.jpg|thumb|300px|Glassware and pottery found in an old dump in [[Meaford, Ontario]].]]
'''Dump digging''' is the practice of locating and excavating old garbage dumps with the intent of discovering objects which have potential value as collectibles or antiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Dumps are a window into history |quote=Campbell and the others call themselves "dumpdiggers," shoveling for signs of the past – pottery, bottles, buttons, cutlery, moustache cups – wherever people once tossed garbage. |work=[[Toronto Star]] |date=January 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These dumps are sometimes centuries old but often date to the late 19th century or early part of the 20th century. Among other things, the practice of dump digging is directly linked to antique bottle collecting and glassmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sha.org/bottle/glassmaking.htm#|title= Historic Glass Bottle Identification &amp; Information Website| accessdate=2011-07-15 |work=Glassmaking &amp; Glassmakers }}&lt;/ref&gt;   

It is a form of [[historical digging]] which involves long hours working with a shovel, pick and other hand tools.  Finding evidence of potential antique bottle dumps or middens is done by searching areas where it is likely that older garbage was deposited.  Diggers generally look for clues of pre1920s junk piles in the woods or down embankments, places where old houses or businesses stand or once stood.  Hiking along waterways and swampy areas, particularly during droughts, can also produce important clues and lead to good discoveries.  

Additionally, many coastal cities are surrounded by landfills or “tips”, places where enormous quantities of trash were deposited in the past intended to create additional acres of viable real estate.  It can take many months of searching each of these locations for a decent dig to be surface.

==Background and controversies==
Dump digging for potentially valuable collectibles is at least as old as the Pharaohs. For practical reasons dump diggers often use a much less forensic style than academic archeologists or museum curators would on their projects. Not unlike the privies, cisterns and wells that other historical diggers explore and salvage in, dumps are typically fleeting sources. They are often located on properties which are in the process of being permanently altered by major development and other factors.

==Items found and locations==
[[File:1870 tobacco pipe, EastEndDumpDiggers.jpg|thumb|250px|A clay pipe discovered while excavating an old bottle dump (ca. 1870).]]
Dump digging can yield different items and artifacts in each location. A town dump can be somewhat different than a farm dump or a railroad dump but in each case there could be industrial age pottery, [[stoneware]], china, tobacco pipes, military relics like bayonets and gun barrels, musket balls, uniform buttons and other buttons, marbles and an assortment of other things.  A high percentage of these dump discoveries are routinely found in severe states of decay, damaged or broken altogether.  In many cases even the things which have stood the test of time remarkably well have little if any monetary value.  There are many exceptions to this general rule that keep dump diggers busy searching and occasionally they are surprised by what they unearth working their sites.          

Through the common process known as tipping, vast amounts of refuse generated by towns and cities were dumped into harbors, along marshy shorelines and other areas while forming viable real estate cheaply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= B.|last= Miller |title=Fat of the Land: Garbage in New York: The Last Two Hundred Years |place=New York |publisher= Four Walls Eight Windows |year=2000|isbn= 1-56858-172-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Excavating in these areas is also a form of dump digging.  Elusive and often deep, small portions of these ashy [[landfill]] dumps are sometimes rediscovered during major development projects.  Enormous quantities of a given locations everyday trash were deposited into these often difficult to reach locales.  

The bulk of this garbage has never been investigated and at present much of it is still undiscovered.  Through researching and active searching occasionally the opportunity arises to dig into small portions and find old bottles and other objects which survive remarkably well as curiosities, collectibles or antiques. For centuries active waterways were also frequently converted into major dumping spots for household and industrial refuse but they are generally impossible to reach without expensive equipment.  Along with the existing information generated from the efforts of dump diggers and others, a wealth of additional information is waiting among these widely distributed landfills and other dumping spots.

'''Elmasburnu Nature Park''' ({{lang-tr|Elmasburnu Tabiat Parkı}}) is a [[nature park]] in [[Istanbul Province]], Turkey.

Elmasburnu (literally "Cape Diamond") is situated east of [[Riva, Beykoz|Riva]] village in the north of [[Beykoz]] district in Istanbul Province on the coast of [[Black Sea]]. An area just south of the cape was declared a [[nature park]] by the [[Ministry of Environment and Forest (Turkey)|Ministry of Environment and Forest]] in 2011. It covers an area of about {{convert|13.34|ha|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="b1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1865">The '''European Academy for Environmental Affairs''' (also known as '''European Academy of Environmental Affairs''') is a private organization which cosponsored the 1995 conference that produced the [[Leipzig Declaration on Global Climate Change]], a [[Science and Environmental Policy Project|SEPP]]-initiated document in which some scientists argue against [[global warming]] theories. Founder and president of the Academy was the late Prof. Dr. hc. [[Helmut Metzner]] (1925-1999), who was professor for chemical [[plant physiology]]. Metzner was accused of having connections to the [[Studienzentrum Weikersheim]], a right-wing think-tank in [[Baden-Württemberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projektwerkstatt.de/oepunkte/althefte/ausgaben/01/54_clinton.html |title=Ö-Punkte - Frühjahr 1998 |publisher=Projektwerkstatt.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 the Academy also held a conference in [[Mannheim]] under the title "Globale Erwärmung - Tatsache oder Behauptung?" (Global warming—fact or fiction?). The Academy was recognized in a consultative function by the [[Council of Europe]], but the status was withdrawn because of the Academy's failure to comply with its obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=251911|title=Granting and withdrawal of consultative status to international non-governmental organisations }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy has no active web pages, and it may be defunct. A list of textbooks on [[ecology]] issued by the Academy is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Introduction to Ecology Study booklets of the European Academy for the Environment | url = http://www.iwoe.de/EuropAkademie.html| accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] is a country in the [[Caucasus]] region. Situated at the juncture of [[Southwest Asia|Western Asia]] and [[Eastern Europe]],&lt;ref name=Eurasia&gt;Georgia may be considered to be in [[Asia]] and/or [[Europe]]. The [[United Nations|UN]] [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm classification of world regions] places Georgia in [[Western Asia]]; the [[CIA World Factbook]] [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gg.html], [http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/atlas/index.html?Parent=asia&amp;Rootmap=georgi&amp;Mode=d&amp;SubMode=w National Geographic], and ''[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/230186/Georgia Encyclopædia Britannica]'' also place Georgia in Asia. Conversely, numerous sources place Georgia in Europe such as the [[BBC]] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1102477.stm], ''Oxford Reference Online'' [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t186.e21064&amp;srn=1&amp;ssid=416740626#FIRSTHIT], ''[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Georgia Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary]'', and [http://worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/eu.htm www.worldatlas.com].&lt;/ref&gt; it is bounded to the west by the [[Black Sea]], to the north by [[Russia]], to the south by [[Turkey]] and [[Armenia]], and to the east by [[Azerbaijan]].  Georgia covers an area of {{convert|69,700|km2|sqmi}}.

== Location ==

Georgia is located in the mountainous [[South Caucasus]] region of [[Eurasia]], straddling [[Southwest Asia|Western Asia]] and [[Eastern Europe]]&lt;ref name=Eurasia /&gt; between the Black Sea and the [[Caspian Sea]].  Georgia's northern border with [[Russia]] roughly runs along the crest of the [[Greater Caucasus]] mountain range – a commonly reckoned boundary between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].  In [[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]]'s 1730 definition of Europe, which was used by the Russian Tsars and which first set the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]] as the eastern border of the continent, the continental border was drawn from the [[Kuma-Manych Depression]] to the Caspian Sea, thereby including all of Georgia (and the whole of the Caucasus) in Asia.

Georgia's proximity to the bulk of Europe, combined with various cultural and political factors, has led increasingly to the inclusion of Georgia in Europe.  Some sources place the country in that region;&lt;ref name=Eurasia /&gt; as well, Georgia has joined European organizations such as the [[Council of Europe]], and is seeking membership in [[Georgia–NATO relations|NATO]] and accession to the [[Georgia and the European Union|European Union]].
Georgia is on the same parallel as Naples, Madrid, Istanbul, New York, Chicago, London, Toronto (Canada), Omaha (USA), Eureka (USA), Odate (Japan), Shenyang (China) and Tirana.

==Topography==
[[Image:Georgia Topography.png|left|thumb|Topography]]
[[Image:Satellite image of Georgia in May 2003.jpg|left|thumb|Satellite image of Georgia in late spring]]
Despite its small area, Georgia has one of the most varied topographies of the former Soviet republics. Georgia lies mostly in the [[Caucasus Mountains]], and its northern boundary is partly defined by the Greater Caucasus range. The Lesser Caucasus range, which runs parallel to the Turkish and Armenian borders, and the Surami and Imereti ranges, which connect the Greater Caucasus and the Lesser Caucasus, create natural barriers that are partly responsible for cultural and linguistic differences among regions. Because of their elevation and a poorly developed transportation infrastructure, many mountain villages are virtually isolated from the outside world during the winter. [[Earthquake]]s and [[landslide]]s in mountainous areas present a significant threat to life and property. Among the most recent natural disasters were massive rock- and mudslides in Ajaria in 1989 that displaced thousands in southwestern Georgia, and two earthquakes in 1991 that destroyed several villages in northcentral Georgia and South Ossetia.

Georgia has about 25,000 rivers, many of which power small [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] stations. Drainage is into the Black Sea to the west and through Azerbaijan to the Caspian Sea to the east. The largest river is the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]], which flows 1,364&amp;nbsp;km from northeast Turkey across the plains of eastern Georgia, through the capital, Tbilisi, and into the Caspian Sea. The [[Rioni River]], the largest river in western Georgia, rises in the Greater Caucasus and empties into the Black Sea at the port of [[Poti]]. Soviet engineers turned the river lowlands along the Black Sea coast into prime subtropical agricultural land, embanked and straightened many stretches of river, and built an extensive system of canals. Deep mountain gorges form topographical belts within the Greater Caucasus.

==Coastline==
[[File:Svaneti, georgia.jpg|thumb|[[Svaneti]] region, northwestern Georgia]]
[[File:Black Sea coast of Georgia (country), with skyline of Batumi on the horizon.jpg|thumb|[[Black Sea]] coast of western Georgia, with the skyline of [[Batumi]] on the horizon.]]
The coastline of Georgia is 310&amp;nbsp;km long. Out of the Georgian coastline, 57&amp;nbsp;km is the coastline of [[Adjara|Ajaria]] (Ajara),&lt;ref name="goBatumi"&gt;{{cite web |author= goBatumi.com |url= http://gobatumi.com/en/feelit/nature-geography | title= Geography |publisher= Website of the Department of Tourism and Resorts of Ajara Autonomous Republic |accessdate= 2 October 2012 |quote= The Ajara coastline is 57 km long.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 200&amp;nbsp;km is the coastline of [[Abkhazia]].&lt;ref name="Proletarskaya Gazeta"&gt;{{cite web |author= Aleksey Danko |url= http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv14n2/pgossetia.htm | title= The Class Roots and Sources of the Aggressive Actions of Georgia Against South Ossetia and Abkhazia and the Aggravation of the Situation in the Caucasus |publisher= Proletarskaya Gazeta #30 |date=November 2008 |accessdate= 2 October 2012 |quote= Moreover, the Abkhazian coast stretches 200 kilometres, which has the potential to significantly increase the influence of either Russia or Georgia on the Black sea, including their military presence.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Encyclopedia of the Nations'' lists the total length of the coastline as 315&amp;nbsp;km long.&lt;ref name="NationsEncyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web |author= Group of editors |url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Europe/Georgia.html | title= Georgia |publisher= Encyclopedia of the Nations |accessdate= 2 October 2012 |quote= The country has a coastline of 315 kilometers (196 miles).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
[[File:Köppen climate classification map of Georgia.svg|thumb|Köppen climate classification regions.]]
Georgia's climate is affected by [[subtropical climate|subtropical]] influences from the west and [[Continental climate|continental]] influences from the east. The Greater Caucasus range moderates local climate by serving as a barrier against cold air from the north. Warm, moist air from the Black Sea moves easily into the coastal lowlands from the west. Climatic zones are determined by distance from the Black Sea and by altitude. Along the Black Sea coast, from Abkhazia to the Turkish border, and in the region known as the [[Colchis|Kolkhida Lowlands]] inland from the coast, the dominant subtropical climate features high humidity and heavy precipitation ({{convert|1000|to|2000|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}} per year; the Black Sea port of Batumi receives {{convert|2500|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}} per year). Several varieties of [[Arecaceae|palm trees]] grow in these regions, where the midwinter average temperature is {{convert|5|°C|lk=on}} and the midsummer average is {{convert|22|°C|1}}.

The plains of eastern Georgia are shielded from the influence of the Black Sea by mountains that provide a more [[continental climate]]. Summer temperatures average {{convert|20|°C}} to {{convert|24|°C|1}}, winter temperatures {{convert|2|°C|1}} to {{convert|4|°C|1}}. Humidity is lower, and rainfall averages {{convert|500|to|800|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year. [[Alpine climate|Alpine]] and [[highland (geography)|highland]] regions in the east and west, as well as a [[semi-arid]] region on the [[Iori Plateau]] to the southeast, have distinct microclimates.

At higher elevations, precipitation is sometimes twice as heavy as in the eastern plains. In the west, the climate is subtropical to about {{convert|650|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; above that altitude (and to the north and east) is a band of moist and moderately warm weather, then a band of cool and wet conditions. Alpine conditions begin at about {{convert|2100|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and above {{convert|3600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} snow and ice are present year-round.

==Environmental issues==
{{main|Environmental issues in Georgia}}
Beginning in the 1980s, Black Sea pollution has greatly harmed Georgia's tourist industry. Inadequate sewage treatment is the main cause of that condition. In Batumi, for example, only 18 percent of wastewater is treated before release into the sea.{{when|date=September 2016}} An estimated 70 percent of surface water contains health-endangering bacteria to which Georgia's high rate of intestinal disease is attributed.

The war in Abkhazia did substantial damage to the ecological habitats unique to that region. In other respects, experts considered Georgia's environmental problems less serious than those of more industrialized former Soviet republics. Solving Georgia's environmental problems was not a high priority of the national government in the post-Soviet years, however; in 1993 the minister for protection of the environment resigned to protest this inactivity. In January 1994, the Cabinet of Ministers announced a new, interdepartmental environmental monitoring system to centralize separate programs under the direction of the Ministry of Protection of the Environment. The system would include a central environmental and information and research agency. The [[Green Party (Georgia)|Green Party]] used its small contingent in the parliament to press environmental issues in 1993.

Georgia participates in a number of international environmental agreements. It is a party to: [[Air Pollution]], [[Biodiversity]], [[Climate Change]], Climate Change-[[Kyoto Protocol]], [[Desertification]], Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, [[Law of the Sea]], Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, and Wetlands.

The archipelago is around {{convert|800|km|sp=us}} from the [[Asia]]n mainland and is located between [[Taiwan]] and [[Borneo]].

The Philippine archipelago is divided into three [[Island groups of the Philippines|island groups]]: [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]]. The Luzon islands include Luzon itself, [[Palawan]], [[Mindoro]], [[Marinduque]], [[Masbate Island|Masbate]], [[Romblon]], [[Catanduanes]], [[Batanes]] and [[Polillo Island|Polilio]]. The Visayas is the group of islands in the central Philippines, the largest of which are: [[Panay]], [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]], [[Cebu]], [[Bohol]], [[Leyte]], [[Samar]], [[Siquijor]], [[Biliran]] and [[Guimaras]]. The Mindanao islands include Mindanao itself, [[Dinagat Island|Dinagat]], [[Siargao]], [[Camiguin]], [[Samal, Davao del Norte|Samal]], plus the [[Sulu Archipelago]], composed primarily of [[Basilan]], [[Sulu]], and [[Tawi-Tawi]].

==Physical geography==
[[File:Ph Territorial Map.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Territorial limits of the Philippines]]

The Philippine archipelago lies in [[Southeast Asia]] in a position that has led to its becoming a cultural crossroads - a place where Malays, Hindus, Arabs, Chinese, Spaniards, Americans, and others had interacted to forge a unique cultural and racial blend. The archipelago numbers some 7,641 islands.&lt;ref name=namria /&gt; The Philippines occupies an area that stretches for {{convert|1850|km|sp=us}} from about the fifth to the twentieth parallels north latitude. The total land area is {{convert|300,000|km2|sp=us|0}}.&lt;ref name="The Philippines"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Philippines|url=https://www.gov.ph/about-the-philippines/|website=Republic of the Philippines, National Government Portal|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psa.gov.ph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="worldbank.org"/&gt; Only approximately 1,000 of its islands are populated, and fewer than one-half of these are larger than {{convert|2.5|km2|sp=us|0}}. Eleven islands make up 95 percent of the Philippine landmass, and two of these — Luzon and Mindanao — measure {{convert|105000|km2|sp=us|0}} and {{convert|95000|km2|sp=us|0}}, respectively. They, together with the cluster of islands in Visayas in between them, represent the three principal regions of the archipelago that are identified by the three stars on the [[Flag of the Philippines|Philippine flag]]. The Philippines is broken up in many islands by the [[sea]]. This gives it the fifth [[List of countries by length of coastline|longest coastline]] of {{convert|36289|km|mi|sp=us}} in the world.&lt;ref name=aboutpmusic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aboutphilippines.ph/filer/toledo-cebu/PHILIPPINE%20MUSIC.pdf|date=June 20, 2015 |title=PHILIPPINE MUSIC|publisher=Balikbayan family-union – AboutPhilippines|author1=Anupol|author2=Cayabyab|author3=Chua|author4=Luarca|author5=Shimamoto|author6=Torio|author7=Yumol}}{{dead link|date=February 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--says the coastline is 17,500 km--&gt;&lt;ref name="CIAfields"&gt;&lt;!--says the coastline is 36,289&amp;nbsp;km and that only Canada, Russia, Indonesia, and Greenland have longer coastlines--&gt;Central Intelligence Agency.

Off the coast of eastern Mindanao is the [[Philippine Trench]], which descends to a depth of {{convert|10430|m|sp=us}}. The Philippines is part of a western Pacific arc system characterized by active volcanoes. Among the most notable peaks are [[Mount Mayon]] near [[Legazpi, Albay|Legazpi City]], [[Taal Volcano]] south of [[Manila]], and [[Mount Apo]] in Mindanao. All of the Philippine islands are prone to earthquakes. The northern Luzon highlands, or Cordillera Central, rise to between {{convert|2500|m|sp=us}} and {{convert|2750|m|sp=us}}, and, together with the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] in the northeastern portion of Luzon and the mountains of Mindanao, boast rain forests that provide refuge for numerous upland tribal groups. The rain forests also offer prime habitat for more than 500 species of birds, including the [[Philippine eagle]] (or monkey-eating eagle), some 1,100 species of [[List of the orchids of the Philippines|orchids]], and some 8,500 species of flowering plants.

The country's most extensive river systems are the [[Pulangi River]], which flows into the [[Mindanao River]] (Rio Grande de Mindanao); the [[Agusan River|Agusan]], in Mindanao which flows north into the [[Mindanao Sea]]; the [[Cagayan River|Cagayan]] in northern Luzon; and the [[Pampanga River|Pampanga]], which flows south from east Central Luzon into [[Manila Bay]]. [[Laguna de Bay]], east of Manila Bay, is the largest freshwater lake in the Philippines. Several rivers have been harnessed for hydroelectric power.

To protect the country's biological resources, the government has taken a first step of preparing a [[Biodiversity Action Plan]] to address conservation of threatened [[species]].

===Topography===
[[File:MajorVolcanoesOfThePhilippines-USGS.gif|thumb|Major volcanoes in the Philippines]]

The islands are volcanic in origin, being part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], and are mostly mountainous. The highest point in the country is the peak of [[Mount Apo]] in [[Mindanao]], which is {{convert|2954|m|sp=us}} above sea level. The second highest point can be found on [[Luzon]] at [[Mount Pulag]], a peak {{convert|2842|m|sp=us}} above sea level.

The [[Philippine Archipelago]] is geologically part of the [[Philippine Mobile Belt]] located between the [[Philippine Sea Plate]], the South China Sea Basin of the [[Eurasian Plate]], and the [[Sunda Plate]]. The [[Philippine Trench]] (also called the Mindanao Trench) is a [[submarine trench]] {{convert|1320|km|sp=us}} in length found directly east of the Philippine Mobile Belt and is the result of a collision of tectonic plates. The Philippine Sea Plate is [[subducting]] under the Philippine Mobile Belt at the rate of about {{convert|16|cm|sp=us}} per year. Its deepest point, the Galathea Depth, has a depth of {{convert|10540|m|sp=us}}. The [[Philippine Fault System]] consists of a series of seismic [[fault (geology)|faults]] that produce several [[earthquake]]s per year, most of which are not felt.

Many volcanoes in the country are active, the most recent eruption being that of [[Mount Pinatubo]] on Luzon in 1991. [[Mount Mayon]] is another of the active volcanoes and has the world's most perfectly shaped cone. Mayon has a violent history of 47 eruptions since 1616 and another violent eruption is currently feared. [[Taal Volcano]], also located on Luzon, is one of the [[Decade Volcanoes]].

Most of the islands used to be covered by [[rainforest|tropical rainforests]]. However, [[illegal logging]] has reduced forest cover to less than 10% of the total land area.

=====The Batanes and Babuyan islands=====
The [[Batanes]] and [[Babuyan Islands]] are situated on the northernmost extremity of the Philippines at [[Luzon Strait]] facing Taiwan. It contains the northernmost point of land, the islet of Y'Ami in the Batanes Islands, separated from Taiwan by the [[Bashi Channel]] (c.{{convert|80.4672|km|sp=us}} wide).

=====Western Luzon=====
This region stretches from [[Mairaira Point]] in [[Pagudpud, Ilocos Norte]] in the north to [[Cochinos Point]] in [[Mariveles, Bataan]] in the south. The terrain ranges from coastal plains to rugged mountains bordered by the [[South China Sea]] in the west and the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Central]] and [[Zambales Mountains|Zambales mountain range]]s in the east. Western Luzon is known for its beaches, surf spots and historic towns.

=====Cagayan Valley=====
Nestled between the Cordilleras in the east and the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] mountain ranges in the west is the Cagayan Valley, also the name of [[Cagayan Valley|the administrative region]] which it covers. Through its center runs the country's longest river, the [[Cagayan River|Cagayan]], flowing in a northward direction before emptying its waters in the [[Luzon Strait]] at the town of [[Aparri, Cagayan|Aparri]].
{{further|Cagayan Valley}}

=====Cordilleras and Caraballos=====
The Cordilleras and [[Caraballo Mountains|Caraballos]], together with the Sierra Madre Range, form the main mountain system in Northern Luzon.

The Cordilleras consists of 2, sometimes 3, mountain ranges that are found in northwestern central Luzon. The first, called ''Caraballo del Sur'', forms the nucleus of the system and has its highest peaks in the border between the provinces of [[Abra (province)|Abra]], [[Ilocos Norte]] and [[Cagayan]]. ''Caraballo Occidentalles'', is further divided into 2 ranges, the Cordillera Norte and Cordillera Central.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} They line the central portions of the [[Cordillera Administrative Region]].
{{further|Cordillera Central (Luzon)|l1=Cordillera Central}}

The Caraballos (''Caraballo de Baler'') start where the Sierra Madre and the Cordilleras meet. They are found south of Cagayan Valley, northeast of the Central Luzon Plains.

=====Sierra Madre Mountains=====
Lying in the eastern portion of Luzon is the longest mountain range in the Philippines, the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]], stretching from [[Quezon]] province in the south to [[Cagayan]] in the north. 80 percent of the mountain range is [[tropical rainforest]], which is diminishing from rampant illegal logging activity. The range serves as the eastern wall of Luzon Island that protects inhabitants from [[tropical cyclone]]s usually coming from the [[Pacific Ocean]].

=====Central Luzon Plains=====
The largest plain of the nation is situated in the [[Central Luzon]] region and produces most of the national rice supply, earning itself the nickname "''Rice Bowl of the Philippines''". The plains encompass the provinces of [[Bulacan]], [[Nueva Ecija]], [[Pampanga]], [[Tarlac]] and [[Pangasinan]].

=====Manila-Katagalugan plains=====
South of the Central Luzon plains lies the largest inland freshwater lake in Southeast Asia, the [[Laguna de Bay]]. To the east of the lake is a plain that stretches westward to the [[Manila Bay]]. Large rivers from bays and mountain springs traverse the plain. In the northern part of the region, that is, [[Manila]] and [[Rizal]], most of the plain had been converted into cities and towns, and are thus industrialized. Lying east of the lake is the southern terminus of the Sierra Madre mountain range at northern [[Quezon]] province.

To the southwest of the Laguna de Bay is the nation's third largest lake, the [[Taal Lake|Taal]], bordered to the north by the [[Tagaytay Ridge]], a [[ridge]] stretching from southern [[Cavite]] to northern [[Batangas]] provinces.

=====Bondoc Peninsula=====
The Bondoc Peninsula is located in the southeastern part of Quezon Province.
{{further|Bondoc Peninsula}}

=====Bicol peninsula=====
Southeast of Laguna de Bay lies the [[Bicol Peninsula]], connected to [[mainland]] Luzon by the [[Tayabas Isthmus|isthmus of Tayabas]]. The predominantly flat landscape features several solitary peaks, usually [[List of active volcanoes in the Philippines|active volcanoes]], which include [[Mount Iriga|Iriga]], [[Mount Mayon|Mayon]] and [[Mount Bulusan|Bulusan]].

The peninsula has an irregular [[coastline]] that features large bays and gulfs, which include the [[Lamon Bay]], [[San Miguel Bay]], [[Lagonoy Gulf]], and [[Albay Gulf]] to the north, and the [[Tayabas Bay]], [[Ragay Gulf]] and [[Sorsogon Bay]] to the south.

=====Mindoro island=====

======Mindoro coastal plains======
Mindoro's coastal plains are characterized by rice and corn fields, rivers, beaches, and extensive open space areas. Most of the population is concentrated on the northern and eastern coast of this island where the city of [[Calapan]] and [[Puerto Galera]] are located.

======Mindoro highlands======
The Mindoro mountain range begins with [[Mount Halcon]] and is further divided into 3. The northwest ends at [[Calavite Point]] and is a landmark for ships. The east originates from [[Lake Naujan]] and the west follows the [[Mindoro Strait]].

=====Palawan=====

======Kalayaan islands (Spratly Islands)======
The [[Kalayaan Islands]] are located to the west of [[Palawan]]. ''Kalayaan'' is a Filipino word meaning "freedom".

=====Eastern Pacific Cordillera=====
The eastern coast of Mindanao features a long mountain range, the [[Eastern Pacific Cordillera]], which stretches from [[Bilar Point]] at Surigao in the north to [[Cape San Agustin]] at Davao in the south. Forming its northern portion are the [[Diwata Mountains]] (also spelled ''Diuata''), separated from the south by low [[mountain pass|passes]] situated at the middle. To the east of the range are narrow strips of lowland that feature several inlets and bays, the most prominent of which include the [[Lianga Bay|Lianga]] and [[Bislig Bay|Bislig]] bays.&lt;ref name=ThePhilippineIslandWorld&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wernstedt|first1=Frederick L.|last2=Spencer|first2=Joseph Earl|title=The Philippine Island World: A Physical, Cultural, and Regional Geography|date=1978|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520035133|pages=32–37|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=6Pn0Pfh1Cl0C&amp;dq|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HumanHelminthiases&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinz|first1=Erhard|title=Human Helminthiases in the Philippines the Epidemiological and Geomedical Situation|date=1985|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=9783642708411|pages=129–131|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=_PvsCAAAQBAJ&amp;dq|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Davao-Agusan Trough=====
To the west of the Pacific Cordillera lies an extensive lowland, the [[Davao-Agusan Trough]]. Its northern portion includes the [[Agusan Valley]] which forms the lower [[river basin]] of the [[Agusan River]]. The river flows in a northward direction and empties into the [[Iligan Bay]]. Draining the southern portion of the lowland are several other rivers, which include the [[Tagum River|Tagum]], flowing southward to the [[Davao Gulf]].&lt;ref name=ThePhilippineIslandWorld /&gt;&lt;ref name=HumanHelminthiases /&gt;

=====Central Mindanao highlands=====
Situated west of the Davao-Agusan Trough is a complex series of mountain ranges called the [[Central Mindanao Highlands]] (also known as the ''Central Cordillera''). From these mountains form the [[headwaters]] of several rivers which include the [[Rio Grande de Mindanao]], [[Pulangi River|Pulangi]], [[Maridagao River|Maridagao]] and [[Tagoloan River|Tagoloan]] rivers. Several tall mountains, such as [[Mount Apo]], the country's highest are found within the range.&lt;ref name=ThePhilippineIslandWorld /&gt;

=====Bukidnon-Lanao plateaus=====
The north-central portion of Mindanao is dominated by an extensive highland region, the [[Bukidnon-Lanao Plateau]], which includes the [[Kitanglad Mountain Range|Kitanglad]] and [[Kalatungan Mountain Range|Kalatungan]] mountain ranges. Within the plateau lies the country's second largest lake, [[Lake Lanao]] situated at an elevation of 2,296 feet, drained by the [[Agus River]] flowing northward to its [[river mouth]] at [[Iligan Bay]].&lt;ref name=ThePhilippineIslandWorld /&gt;

=====Cotabato Basin=====
South of the Bukidnon-Lanao Plateau lies a large [[depression (geology)|depression]], the Cotabato Basin, which forms the lower river basin of the country's second largest river system, the [[Rio Grande de Cagayan]] (also known as the ''Mindanao River''). Surrounded by three mountain ranges, the basin's only opening to the sea is to the northwest at [[Illana Bay]], where the Mindanao River empties into the ocean.&lt;ref name=ThePhilippineIslandWorld /&gt;&lt;ref name=HumanHelminthiases /&gt;

To the southeast of the main basin are two large valleys, the [[Koronadal Valley|Koronadal]] and [[Allah Valley|Allah]] valleys.&lt;ref name=ThePhilippineIslandWorld /&gt;

=====Tiruray highlands=====
Situated south and west of the Cotabato Basin are a moderately high mountain range, the [[Tiruray Highlands]], which block off the Basin from the southern coastline.&lt;ref name=HumanHelminthiases /&gt; South of the highlands are narrow strips of coastlines.&lt;ref name=ThePhilippineIslandWorld /&gt;

=====Zamboanga peninsula=====
At the northwestern tip of Mindanao is the generally mountainous [[Zamboanga Peninsula (geographical region)|Zamboanga Peninsula]]. The chain of mountain ranges in this region is called ''[[Zamboanga Cordilleras]]'', with the highest elevation at [[Mount Dapi]], which is {{convert|2617|m|sp=us}} high.

The southern coastline is irregular, featuring two smaller peninsulas, the [[Sibuguey Peninsula|Sibuguey]] and [[Baganian Peninsula|Baganian]], extending southward to the [[Moro Gulf]].&lt;ref name=ThePhilippineIslandWorld /&gt;

=====Outlying islands of Mindanao=====

======Dinagat and Siargao islands======
To the north of the [[Diwata Mountains]] at northeast Mindanao lie [[Siargao]] island and the [[Dinagat Islands|Dinagat group of islands]].&lt;ref name=ThePhilippineIslandWorld /&gt;

=====Sulu archipelago=====
Southwest of the Zamboanga Peninsula is the [[Sulu Archipelago]], a chain of islands which comprise the smaller archipelago provinces of [[Basilan]], [[Sulu]], and [[Tawi-Tawi]].&lt;ref name=ThePhilippineIslandWorld /&gt;

==Administrative geography==
{{Details|Administrative divisions of the Philippines}}

The Philippines is divided into a hierarchy of local government units (LGUs) with the 81 [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] and 38 [[Cities of the Philippines|independent cities]] as the primary unit. Provinces are further subdivided into [[Cities of the Philippines|component cities]] and [[Philippine municipality|municipalities]], both of which consist of [[barangay]]s, the smallest local government unit.

===Regions===
There are 17 [[Regions of the Philippines|regions]] comprising the Philippines. Each region, with the exception of the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]], is further subdivided into component [[Philippine provinces|provinces]]. The [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]] is divided into four [[Administrative divisions of Metro Manila#Districts|special districts]].

Most government offices establish regional offices in a city to serve the constituent provinces. Such cities are designated as "regional centers". The regions themselves do not possess a separate local government, with the exception of the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]].

{{further|Regions of the Philippines}}

===Provinces===
Forming the regions, with the exception of the [[Metro Manila|National Capital]], are the 81 [[Philippine provinces|provinces]]. Each province has a [[capital city|capital city or municipality]].

==Climate==
{{Main|Climate of the Philippines}}
[[File:Philippines map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Philippines map of Köppen climate classification.]]

The Philippines has a [[tropical climate]] dominated by a rainy season and a dry season, although certain locations have no dry season (meaning, all months have an average rainfall of above 60&amp;nbsp;mm) and certain higher-altitude areas can have a [[subtropical climate]]. The summer monsoon brings heavy rains to most of the archipelago from May to October, whereas the winter monsoon brings relatively cooler and drier air from December to February. Manila and most of the lowland areas are hot and dusty from March to May. Even at this time, however, temperatures rarely rise above {{convert|37|°C|1}}. Mean annual sea-level temperatures rarely fall below {{convert|27|°C|1}}. Annual rainfall measures as much as {{convert|5000|mm|in|1|sp=us}} in the mountainous east coast section of the country, but less than {{convert|1000|mm|in|1|sp=us}} in some of the sheltered valleys.

Monsoon rains, although hard and drenching, are not normally associated with high winds and waves. But the Philippines sit astride the typhoon belt, and it suffers an annual onslaught of dangerous storms from July through October. These are especially hazardous for northern and eastern Luzon and the [[Bicol Region|Bicol]] and [[Eastern Visayas]] regions, but Manila gets devastated periodically as well.

In the last decade, the Philippines has been hit severely by natural disasters. In 2005 alone, Central Luzon was hit by both a drought, which sharply curtailed hydroelectric power, and by a typhoon that flooded practically all of low-lying Manila's streets. Still more damaging was the 1990 earthquake that devastated a wide area in Luzon, including Baguio and other northern areas. The city of Cebu and nearby areas were struck by a typhoon that killed more than a hundred people, sank vessels, destroyed part of the sugar crop, and cut off water and electricity for several days. The Philippines is prone to about 6-9 storms which make landfall each year, on average. The 1991 [[Mount Pinatubo]] eruption also damaged much of Central Luzon, the lahar burying towns and farmland, and the ashes affecting global temperatures.

Building construction is undertaken with natural disasters in mind. Most rural housing has consisted of nipa huts that are easily damaged but are inexpensive and easy to replace. Most urban buildings are steel and concrete structures designed (not always successfully) to resist both typhoons and earthquakes. Damage is still significant, however, and many people are displaced each year by typhoons, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. In 1987 alone the Department of Social Welfare and Development helped 2.4 million victims of natural disasters.

===Subnational enclaves and exclaves===
In [[political geography]], an [[enclave]] is a territory or part of a territory lying wholly within the boundaries of another, and an [[exclave]] is one which is politically attached to a larger piece but not actually contiguous with it. Many entities are both enclaves and exclaves, but the two are not synonymous.

====Exclaves which are not enclaves====
* [[Caloocan City]] is divided in two by [[Valenzuela, Metro Manila|Valenzuela City]] and [[Quezon City]].
* In [[Cotabato]] province, the municipality of [[President Roxas, Cotabato|President Roxas]] is divided in two by [[Antipas, Cotabato|Antipas]] municipality.

====Pene-enclaves/exclaves and inaccessible districts====
* In [[SoCCSKSarGen]], [[Sarangani]] province is divided by [[General Santos City]] or [[Sarangani Bay]].
* In [[Zamboanga Peninsula]]:
** [[Isabela, Basilan|Isabela City]] is part of this region (although it is the capital of the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao|ARMM]] province of [[Basilan]]), but it is separated from it by Basilan Strait.
* [[Zamboanga del Sur]] — [[Zamboanga City]], a chartered city, is unofficially part of this province but is separated from it by [[Zamboanga Sibugay]].

===Subnational quadripoint===
A [[quadripoint]] is a point on the Earth that touches four distinct regions. Such points are often called "four corners", from the corners of the four regions meeting there.
* Four provinces in Mindanao meet at a point at the summit of [[Mount Apo]]: [[Bukidnon]] of Northern Mindanao Region, [[Davao del Norte]] and [[Davao del Sur]] of Davao Region, and [[Cotabato Province]] of [[SOCCSKSARGEN|Soccsksargen]]

====More than four====
Four distinct geographic divisions converging at a single point is not uncommon in the Philippines, and there are other points of convergence between five or more divisions that can be found.

The boundaries of the [[Philippine archipelago]] are described in Article III of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)]], as comprising an [[irregular polygon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/sp1898.asp Treaty of Peace Between the United States and Spain], The Avalon project.&lt;/ref&gt; A box enclosing that polygon would have corners at 20°N 116°E, 20°N 127°E, 4.75°N 127°E, 4.75°N 116°E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7191">[[File:Cambodia geology2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Geologic map of Cambodia]]
The '''geology of [[Cambodia]]''' is the study of the nation's rocks, minerals, water and landforms. Cambodia's ancient geologic history in the [[Precambrian]] is poorly understood. The region experienced tectonic activity and low-grade metamorphic rock formation throughout [[Paleozoic]], which a shift to marine conditions and fossil formation during the [[Permian]] and through much of the [[Mesozoic]]. Few rocks remain from the [[Cenozoic]]. Cambodia has comparatively few natural resources, although there is [[bauxite]] formed from [[laterite]] weathering, as well as phosphorite, iron, gems, limestone and other materials.&lt;ref name=Workman1997&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/1-4020-4495-X_18 |chapter=Cambodia |title=Encyclopedia of European and Asian Regional Geology |pages=122–7 |series=Encyclopedia of Earth Science |year=1997 |last1=Workman |first1=D. R |editor1-last=Moores |editor1-first=E.M. |editor2-last=Fairbridge |editor2-first=Rhodes W. |isbn=978-0-412-74040-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stratigraphy, Tectonics &amp; Geologic History==
There are no dated Precambrian rocks in Cambodia, but the gneiss and schist of the Proterozoic Kontum Massif Vietnam extend into the northeast of the country from Vietnam. High-grade metamorphic rocks that may be from the Precambrian are also found at Pailin in the west. This area has [[gneiss]] and [[amphibolite]], [[diorite]], [[granodiorite]] and relatively uniform mineralogy including [[quartz]], [[plagioclase]] and [[hornblende]].&lt;ref name=Workman1997/&gt;

===Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)===
Not much is known about the early [[Paleozoic]] in Cambodia. Some rock sequences without fossils have been mapped as Cambrian and Silurian rocks because they underlie younger Paleozoic rocks. They tend to be intensely deformed and have low-grade regional metamorphism and are most common in southern Cambodian. [[Quartzite]] is interbedded with [[rhyolite]], quartz, [[tourmaline]] [[schist]], [[sericite]] shist and [[chlorite]] schist. Some true mica schist is also found along with [[sillimanite]] but the grade of metamorphism tends to be low. Only one fossil in Cambodia is known from the Cambrian. It is a trilobite from 10 kilometers northwest of Stung Treng in the north. The fossil is housed in black, sandy [[argillite]]. Late Paleozoic rocks from the Devonian to the Carboniferous are common in southern Cambodia. Most exposures lack fossils, and many are strongly folded and heavily fractured, containing[[chert]] and [[jasper]].  In some cases, there are trace radiolaria and sponge fossils. Sandstone, black [[shale]], [[breccia]], and limestone are found toward the top of the sequences. The Permian is primarily marked by limestones with large occurrences at Battambang.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

Extensive [[Permian]] limestone rocks are found at Sisophon in the west and to the south at Kampot, containing coral and brachiopod fossils. These fossils helped to establish the age of the limestone which is sometimes interbedded with clastic rocks. There is extensive karst landscape with many caves underlying much of Cambodia.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

===Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)===
[[Triassic]] rocks are very common in Cambodia, although they do not contain many fossils. Marine Triassic rocks are well documented near Rovieng in the north. Triassic rocks include shale, sandstone, conglomerates and some fragments of volcanic rocks including [[andesite]]. The [[Indosinian Orogeny]] in the Triassic affected the region with some moderate folding. Hydrocarbon research on the Khorat Plateau suggests that the Indochina Terrane was a series of continental fault blocks separated by Permian rifting.&lt;ref name="Morley et al 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jseaes.2012.11.021 |title=Development of the Khao Khwang Fold and Thrust Belt: Implications for the geodynamic setting of Thailand and Cambodia during the Indosinian Orogeny |journal=Journal of Asian Earth Sciences |volume=62 |pages=705–19 |year=2013 |last1=Morley |first1=C.K |last2=Ampaiwan |first2=P |last3=Thanudamrong |first3=S |last4=Kuenphan |first4=N |last5=Warren |first5=J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine conditions were common, although the later periods were marked by lagoon and continent conditions and red beds formed.

During the [[Jurassic]] marine conditions returned. A fossil [[ammonite]] was found at one location in eastern Cambodia. The Sre Pok Valley has numerous beds of rock with ammonite fossils, recording deep water sediments near the Vietnamese border by the [[Middle Jurassic]]. Continental conditions were the norm and thick sequences of sandstone and conglomerate formed during the [[Cretaceous]]. These comprise much of the Cardamome Mountains in the southwest and can be up to one to two kilometers thick. Sometimes these rocks also contain plan and pollen remains.&lt;ref name=Workman1997/&gt;

===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
There are very few [[Cenozoic]] rocks in Cambodia. However, there is quite a bit of evidence from the [[Quaternary]], the last 2.5 million years, particularly in floodplains and valleys where terraces in the sediment are common. However, sometimes these deposits are very thin over underlying bedrock.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

==Natural resource geology==
Cambodia has few natural resources, mainly gold and some non-metallic minerals. Artisanal mining often extracts gold bearing alluvium, which originated from quartz veins in different rocks. Gold was found at Suptrup in 1877 and mined until 1940.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

[[Bauxite]], iron ore, tin, [[greisen]] and [[aplite]] are also known, although only bauxite appears to be economically valuable. Bauxite formed from[[ laterite]] weathering of Cenozoic basalt on the Haut Chhalong Plateau near the Vietnamese border. [[Phosphorite]] and limestone are the main non metallic minerals. Phosphorite forms in caves and fissures from Permian organic material. A small phosphorite mine opened in 1966 with a crushing plant after having first been worked starting in 1919. Cambodia also has gems including sapphire. Pailin, in the area of Bokeo is known for large, high quality [[zircon]] crystals.&lt;ref name=Workman1997/&gt;

==History of geologic research==
Geological mapping of Cambodia was first carried out by the French service, Service Geologique de l'Indochine based in Hanoi in the years between World War I and World War II. Various mineral prospects were explored at that time and again in the 1950s and 1960s with the assistance after independence of France, China in the UN between 1967 and 1970. The whole country was mapped in a reconnaissance level by French geologists and a 1:200,000 scale map with 14 sheets was published. Out of a pre-1975 staff of 60 only eight returned including four technicians after the Khmer Rouge. Currently the responsibility for mapping rests with the Department of Geology and Mines and the Ministry of Industry.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

==Background==
[[File:BengalPartition1905 Map.png|thumb|300 px|Map of the Bengal Partition|Map showing the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|partition of Bengal into Bengal and East Bengal and Assam in 1905]]]]

Geo-political region of [[Bengal]] was first united as one single independent state by King [[Shashanka]] who conquered all of what is now Bangladesh, West Bengal, Tripur, Jharkhand and parts of Southern Assam and East and Central Bihar. This region was again united by the Bengali Buddhist [[Pala Empire|Pala Emperors]] whose power centred around this region but their reign expanded to included lands from as high as the Kashmiri hills to modern day [[Andhra Pradesh]]. During the successive rule of the Hindu [[Sena dynasty]] in Bengal the notion of a Greater Bangladesh first emerged with the idea of uniting Bengali-speaking people in the areas now known as [[Tripura]], [[Assam]] and [[Meghalaya]] along with the [[Bengal]] which at that point also Included the states of [[Bihar]] and [[Jharkhand]] which are now considered non-Bengali states.&lt;ref&gt;Mikey Leung and Belinda Meggitt, ''Bangladesh'', page 7-8, Bradt Travel Guides, 2009, {{ISBN|1-84162-293-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Sena Dynasty]]'s collapse subsequently the region became the hub of Islamic culture and prominience of the Muslim East and the region flourished to be an economic superpower. After the [[Battle of Raj Mahal]] The [[Bengal Sultanate]] was integrated imto the [[Mughal Empire]] with the empire's Crown Princes acting as it's viceroy.

After the Maratha rebellions in Northern India the Bengal province became autonomous and was ruled by the [[Nawab of Bengal]] however after the [[Battle of Plassey]] the region became the administrative division of British India with Bengal's capital [[Calcutta]] becoming the Indian capital. [[Bengal Presidency]] was formed in 1765. In 1905, the presidency was divided into Bengal province and East Bengal and Assam province. In 1911, Bengal was reunited. Assam including Meghalaya and [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]] was severed from the Presidency in 1874. Assam became the Province of Assam together with Lushai Hills in 1912. In 1912 Bengal was separated into various states of the British empire after being a tense area of the Indian independence movement. These new provinces were [[Bihar and Orissa]] and [[East Bengal and Assam]] however the westernmost part of the [[Bihar and Orissa]] province and East Bengal were reunited to become a smaller but yet united Bengal.  This province was partitioned again in 1947 into [[Hindu]]-majority West Bengal and [[Muslim]]-majority [[East Bengal]] (now Bangladesh) to facilitate the creation of the separate [[Muslim]] state of Pakistan, of which East Bengal became a province.&lt;ref name="Mukherjee1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Soumyendra Nath Mukherjee|title=Sir William Jones: A Study in Eighteenth-century British Attitudes to India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bhd-_1RE04MC&amp;pg=PA230|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-86131-581-9|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Bengal===
{{see also|Partition of Bengal (1947)|United Bengal}}

In January 1947, [[Sarat Chandra Bose]] resigned from the [[Indian National Congress]], partially in protest against the partition of Bengal. He called for an Independent Bengal separate from both India and Pakistan, and formed his own party, the [[Socialist Republican Party (India)|Socialist Republican Party]].&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anton Pelinka and Renée Schell, ''Democracy Indian style'', page 79, Transaction Publishers, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7658-0186-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]] and [[Abul Hashem]], two Bengali leaders of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] also advocated for an Independent Bengal comprising both the Eastern (now Bangladesh) and Western (now West Bengal) parts of Bengal.&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Bhaskaran Nair, ''Politics in Bangladesh: a study of Awami League, 1949-58'', page 46, Northern Book Centre, 1990, {{ISBN|81-85119-79-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mohammad Akram Khan]] and [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]], two other Muslim League leaders wanted a United Bengal as part of Pakistan. [[Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha]] and [[Syama Prasad Mookerjee]], the founder of [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]] which later was succeeded by [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), opposed the idea of an Independent Bengal or a United Bengal.&lt;ref name=Fraser&gt;Bashabi Fraser, ''Bengal Partition Stories: An Unclosed Chapter'', page 24-25, Anthem Press, 2008, {{ISBN|1-84331-299-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu Mahashabha and Mookerjee were concerned about Bose and Suhrawardy discussing a sovereign state of Bengal, while opposing the idea of a United Bengal, even as part of India. [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], then a leader of the majority faction of the Congress, was opposed to a United Bengal unless it was connected to the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Zachariah, ''Nehru'', page 136, Routledge, 2004, {{ISBN|0-415-25017-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==

===Lebensraum theory===

Achieving a "Greater Bangladesh" as [[Lebensraum]] (additional living space) is alleged to be the reason for large-scale illegal immigration from Bangladesh into India's states.&lt;ref name="C"/&gt; Similarly it is alleged that illegal immigration is actively encouraged by some political groups in Bangladesh as well as the state of Bangladesh to convert large parts of India's northeastern states, particularly [[Assam]] and [[West Bengal]] into Muslim-majority areas that would subsequently seek to separate from India and join Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="C"/&gt; One Indian proposition is that the state of Bangladesh is pursuing a territorial design seeking a Lebensraum for its teeming population and trying to establish a Greater Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=Schendel1/&gt; Another proposition called for capturing one or two districts in Bangladesh and sending illegal immigrants there.&lt;ref name=Schendel1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Send All Infiltrators to a Space in Bangladesh", ''The Shillong Times'', 20 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another proposition called for killing off Bangladeshi immigrants in India to thwart the designs of state of Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;Falguni Burman, "Check Bangla Influx for Survival: VHP", ''The Assam Tribune'', 20 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

It is suspected, though, that the figures of Bangladeshi migrants in India are too far-fetched to be accorded any credence.&lt;ref name=Soman/&gt; The diplomatic difficulty is increased by the failure of conspiracy theorists in India to comprehend that supporting Indian rebels in a plot to carve out a Greater Bangladesh would bring very little strategic dividend to Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=Soman/&gt; Scholars have also reflected that under the guise of Bangladeshi immigrant movement it is actually a Muslim  false propaganda and widely understated claims on immigrant population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.monash.edu.au/mai/asaa/rizwanashamshad.pdf POLITICS AND ORIGIN OF THE INDIA-BANGLADESH BORDER FENCE, p: 12]&lt;/ref&gt; There also is an alleged parallel threat of turning Assam into a part of a Greater West Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;Harendranath Barua and Yogeśa Dāsa, ''Reflections on Assam, 1944-1983'', page 185, Harendranath Barua Memorial Society, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joya Chatterji, ''The spoils of partition: Bengal and India, 1947-1967'', page 46, Cambridge University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-521-87536-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migration theory===
{{see also|Illegal immigration in India}}

At the turn of the 21st century, Indian political circles started to take a serious look at Bangladeshi illegal immigration into India.&lt;ref name=Schendel1&gt;Willem van Schendel, ''The Bengal borderland: beyond state and nation in South Asia'', page 233-34, Anthem Press, 2005, {{ISBN|1-84331-145-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh is under pressure from India as a source of rebellion in Indian North-East for this Indian perception.&lt;ref name=Soman&gt;Zakia Soman and Jimmy Dabhi, ''Peace and Justice'', page 138-39, Pearson Education India, 2010, {{ISBN|81-317-2944-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also hard pressed to convince India that encouraging migration is not a state policy of Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=Soman/&gt; The state of Bangladesh denied the existence of these immigrants while stripping them of their Bangladeshi citizenship.&lt;ref name=Schendel1/&gt; According to Jyoti M. Pathania of South Asia Analysis Group the reasons for Bangladeshi immigration to India are: basic need theory i.e. food, shelter and clothing, economic dictates i.e. employment opportunity, better wages and comparatively better living conditions, demographic disproportion especially for minorities (Hindus) in this densely populated country having roughly a density of 780 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as against half that number on Indian side of the border, and being cheap labor the Bangladeshis find easy acceptance as “domestic helps” in Indian homes, which keeps proliferating by ever increasing demand for domestic helps.&lt;ref&gt;Jyoti M.

===Militancy theory===
{{see also|Bangladesh–India relations}}

A number of Indian politicians and journalists alleged that advocates of a Greater Bangladesh seek the expansion of Bangladeshi hegemony in [[Northeastern India]], including the states of Assam, West Bengal, Meghalaya and Tripura, as well as the [[Arakan Province]] of [[Burma]] (Myanmar), where there is a considerable population of [[Bengali Muslims]].&lt;ref name=Ved1/&gt;&lt;ref name="C"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Illegal migration from Bangladesh|author=Braja Bihari Kumara|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|year=2006|isbn=978-81-8069-224-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also alleged that [[United Liberation Front of Asom]] (ULFA) conspired with state of Bangladesh to secede four to five Muslim majority districts of Assam to form a Greater Bangladesh, though Bangladesh in the contrary arrested a number of ULFA leaders,&lt;ref&gt;M. Sakhawat Hussain, ''South Asian tangle'', page 204, Palok Publishers &amp; Bangladesh Research Forum, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; including Ranju Chowdhury, [[Arabinda Rajkhowa]] and [[Anup Chetia]], to support Indian action against militancy.&lt;ref&gt;PTI, "[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article448844.ece ULFA leader arrested in Bangladesh]", ''[[The Hindu]]'', 2010-06-07&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, nine Islamic groups including Indian militant organizations [[Muslim United Liberation Tigers of Assam]] (MULTA), Muslim United Liberation Front of Assam (MULFA) and Muslim Volunteer Force (MVF), Pakistani militant organization [[Harkat-ul-Mujahideen]] (HUM), Myanmar groups [[Rohingya Solidarity Organization]] (RSO) and Arakan Rohingya Islamic Front of Myanmar (ARIFM), and [[Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami]], a pan-South Asian militant organization outlawed in Bangladesh with leaders sentenced to death,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7797096.stm Three to die for UK envoy attack], BBC, 2008-12-23&lt;/ref&gt; formed a coalition that declared the formation Greater Bangladesh as one of their aims.&lt;ref name=Ved1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hiranmay Karlekar, ''Bangladesh:

==Effects of allegation==

===Nellie massacre===
{{see also|Nellie massacre}}
In Assam, [[Assam agitation|agitation]] against immigrants started as early as 1979, led by [[All Assam Students Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dm.architexturez.org/digitalNE/assam%20agitation.htm From 1979 to 1985: The Anti-Foreigners Movement in Assam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725013418/http://dm.architexturez.org/digitalNE/assam%20agitation.htm |date=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their demand was to put a stop on the influx of immigrants and deportation of those who have already settled.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/assam/documents/papers/illegal_migration_in_assam.htm Report on illegal migration into assam]&lt;/ref&gt; It gradually took violent form and ethnic violence started between Assamese and Bengalis, mostly Muslim. It eventually led to the infamous [[Nellie massacre]] in 1983 due to a controversy over the 1983 election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twocircles.net/special_reports/nellie_1983.html Nellie 1983: A series by TwoCircles.net]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 [[Government of India|Indian Government]] signed the [[Assam accord]] with the leaders of the agitation to stop the issue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aasc.nic.in/Acts%20and%20Rules%20(GOA)/Implementation%20of%20Assam%20Accord%20Deptt/Assam%20Accord.pdf Full text of the accord]&lt;/ref&gt; As per the accord India started building a fence along the Assam-Bangladesh border which is now almost complete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/assam/documents/papers/assam_accord_1985.htm#Assam_Accord Achievements of Assam accord]&lt;/ref&gt; However Assam also has a large number of genuine Indian Muslim Bengalis. It is difficult to distinguish between illegal Bangladeshis and local [[Bengali people|Bengali]] speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcim.org/attachements/GMP%20No%2042.pdf Indifference, impotence, and intolerance:transnational Bangladeshis in India, Sujata Ramachandran] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723192023/http://www.gcim.org/attachements/GMP%20No%2042.pdf |date=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic and religious tensions in the Indian North East had led to massacre of Bengali-speaking Muslims in Nellie in February 1983.&lt;ref&gt;K.

===The Sinha Report===
{{see also|India–Bangladesh border}}
In 1998, Lieutenant General [[S.K. Sinha]], then the [[Governor of Assam]] and later the [[Governor of Jammu and Kashmir]], wrote a report to [[K.R. Narayanan]], then the [[President of India]] claiming that massive illegal immigration from Bangladesh was directly linked with "the long-cherished design of Greater Bangladesh," and also quoted pre-1971 comments from late [[Pakistani Prime Minister]] [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]] and late [[President of Bangladesh]] [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] endorsing the inclusion of Assam into [[East Pakistan]] (now Bangladesh).&lt;ref name="C"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Assam governor asks Centre to seal Bangladesh border|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/feb/13secu.htm|author=Arup Chandra|date=13 February 1999|accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anxiety and popular anger over illegal immigration prompted political unrest in the state of Assam, and criticism has increased over the Indian government's failure to secure its borders with Bangladesh and stop the illegal immigration.&lt;ref name="C"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R"/&gt;

The '''''Handbook of the Birds of India and Pakistan''''' is the ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' of Indian [[ornithologist]] [[Salim Ali]], written along with [[S. Dillon Ripley]]. Appended to the title is the phrase "''together with those of Bangladesh, Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan and Sri Lanka''".  The 10 volume work, often referred to as "the handbook", was started in 1964 and ended in 1974. A single volume "compact edition" of the "Handbook" was also produced and a supplementary illustrative work ''A Pictorial Guide to the Birds of the Indian Subcontinent'' with illustrations by John Henry Dick, coauthored with Dillon Ripley, was published in 1983. The plates from this supplement were incorporated in the second edition of the "Handbook".&lt;ref name=hbk/&gt; The second edition was completed by others, notably J. S. Serrao of the BNHS, Bruce Beehler, Michel Desfayes and [[Pamela Rasmussen]], after the deaths of Ali in 1987 and Ripley in 2001.&lt;ref name=hbk&gt;{{cite book|author=Ali, S &amp; SD Ripley| year=1999| title=Handbook of the Birds of India and Pakistan.

The Hindu Kush range has numerous high snow-capped peaks, with the highest point in the Hindu Kush being [[Tirich Mir]] or Terichmir at {{convert|7708|m}} in the [[Chitral District]] of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], Pakistan. To the north, near its northeastern end, the Hindu Kush buttresses the [[Pamir Mountains]] near the point where the borders of China, Pakistan and Afghanistan meet, after which it runs southwest through Pakistan and into Afghanistan near their border.&lt;ref name="Searle2013p157"/&gt; The eastern end of the Hindu Kush in the north merges with the [[Karakoram Range]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Karakoram-Range Karakoram Range: MOUNTAINS, ASIA], Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stefan Heuberger|title=The Karakoram-Kohistan Suture Zone in NW Pakistan – Hindu Kush Mountain Range|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67JwfOvNm4UC&amp;pg=PA25|year=2004|publisher=vdf Hochschulverlag AG|isbn=978-3-7281-2965-9|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards its southern end, it connects with the [[Safēd Kōh|Spin Ghar Range]] near the [[Kabul River]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Spin-Ghar-Range Spīn Ghar Range, MOUNTAINS, PAKISTAN-AFGHANISTAN], Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jonathan M.

According to [[:it:Gherardo Gnoli|Gherardo Gnoli]], "if we compare the first chapter of the ''[[Vidēvdād]]'' with the passages of geographical interest that we come across mainly in the great [Zoroastrian] [[Yasht|yašts]], we can conclude that the geographical area of Avesta was dominated by the Hindu Kush range at the center, the western boundary being marked by the districts of Margiana, Areia, and Drangiana, the eastern one by the Indo-Iranian frontier regions such as Gandhāra, Bunēr, the land of the Seven Rivers."&lt;ref&gt;G.

In the time of [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Hindu]] Kush range was referred to as the ''Caucasus Indicus'' or the "Caucasus of the [[Indus River]]" (as opposed to the [[Greater Caucasus]] range between the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s), and in the time of [[Islam in India]], the regular invasions possibly derived Hind Kash as ''Hindu Kush'' ''Hindū Kūh'' ({{nastaliq|ھندوکوه}}) and ''Kūh-e Hind'' ({{nastaliq|کوهِ ھند}}) usually applied to the entire range separating the basins of the [[Kabul River|Kabul]] and [[Helmand River]]s from that of the [[Amu Darya]], or, more specifically, to that part of the range lying northwest of [[Kabul]]. Sanskrit documents refer to the Hindu Kush as Hind kshetra in short Hind Kash as frontier lands of India. "Kash as in [[Kashmir]] (pronounced as कश in Hindi, in English written as Kush)" word also synonym of frontier part of a "Kusha" grass. Hind Kash all around from Amu Darya (in Vedic Sanskrit Vakṣu (वक्षु) river) to Kashmir was Kshetra (place) for meditation and teaching by founders of Hinduism. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.savarkar.org/content/pdfs/en/six_glorious_epochs-1to6_savarkar_en_v000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The word Koh or Kuh means "mountain" in the local language, Khowar. According to Nigel Allan, ''Hindu Kush'' meant both "mountains of India" and "sparkling snows of India", as he notes, from a Central Asian perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allan |first=Nigel |title=Defining Place and People in Afghanistan |journal=Post Soviet Geography and Economics |year=2001 |volume=42 |series=8 |pages=545–560}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, some believe it to be the name derived from the rule of the Hindu god Rama's son, Kusha, who ruled in Kasur, in present-day Punjab, Pakistan.  Hindū Kūh (ھندوکوه) and Kūh-e Hind (کوهِ ھند) are usually applied to the entire range separating the basins of the Kabul and Helmand rivers from that of the Amu River (ancient Oxus), or more specifically, to that part of the range lying northwest of the Afghan capital Kabul. Sanskrit documents possibly refer to the Hindu Kush as [[Pariyatra Mountains|Pāriyātra Parvata]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

The name Hindu Kush is relatively young, states Ervin Grötzbach, and it is "missing from the accounts of the early Arab geographers and occurs for the first time in Ibn Baṭṭuṭa (ca. 1330)". Ibn Baṭṭuṭa, states Grötzbach, saw the "origin of the name Hindu Kush (Hindu-killer) in the fact that numerous Hindu slaves died crossing the pass on their way from India to Turkestan".&lt;ref name="iranicaonline"&gt;Ervin Grötzbach (2012 Edition, Original: 2003), [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hindu-kush Hindu Kush], Encyclopaedia Iranica&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, state Fosco Maraini and Nigel Allan, the earliest known usage occurs on a map published about 1000 CE.&lt;ref name=brithkushfm/&gt; According to Allan, the term ''Hindu Kush'' has been commonly seen to mean "Hindu killer", but two other meanings of the term include "sparkling snows of India" and "mountains of India" with "Kush" possibly a soft variant of ''Kuh'' which means "mountain". Hindu Kush in Arabic means mountains of India. To Arab geographers, states Allan, Hindu Kush was the frontier boundary where Hindustan started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allan |first=Nigel |title=Defining Place and People in Afghanistan |journal=Post Soviet Geography and Economics |year=2001 |volume=42 |series=8 |pages=545–560}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brithkushfm&gt;Fosco Maraini et al.,

According to McColl, the origins of the Hindu Kush name are controversial. Along with its origin in the perishing of Indian slaves, two other possibilities exist.&lt;ref name="McColl2014p413"/&gt; The term could be a corruption of Hindu Koh from pre-Islamic times where it separated Hindu population of southern Afghanistan from non-Hindu population in northern Afghanistan. The second possibility is that the name may be from the ancient [[Avestan language]], with the meaning "water mountain".&lt;ref name="McColl2014p413"/&gt;

===Other names===
The mountain range was also called ''"[[Paropamisadae]]"'' by Hellenic Greeks in the late first millennium BC.&lt;ref name="Vogelsang"/&gt;

Some 19th century Encyclopedias and gazetteers state that the term ''Hindu Kush'' originally applied only to the peak in the area of the [[Kushan Pass]], which had become a centre of the [[Kushan Empire]] by the first century.&lt;ref&gt;1890,1896 ''Encyclopedia Brittanica'' s.v. "Afghanistan", Vol I p.228.;&lt;br&gt;1893, 1899 ''Johnson's Universal Encyclopedia'' Vol I p.61.;&lt;br&gt;1885 ''Imperial Gazetteer of India'', V. I p. 30.;&lt;br&gt;1850 ''A Gazetteer of the World'' Vol I p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars remove the space, and refer to Hindu Kush as "Hindukush".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karl Jettmar|author2=Schuyler Jones|title=The Religions of the Hindukush: The religion of the Kafirs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ig8ngEACAAJ|year=1986|publisher=Aris &amp; Phillips|isbn=978-0-85668-163-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Winiger | first=M. | last2=Gumpert | first2=M. | last3=Yamout | first3=H. | title=Karakorum-Hindukush-western Himalaya: assessing high-altitude water resources | journal=Hydrological Processes | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | volume=19 | issue=12 | year=2005 | pages=2329–2338 | doi=10.1002/hyp.5887 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mountains==
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
The Hindu Kush is a formidable mountain range to cross with most peaks being between 14,500 and 17,000 feet, and some much higher. The mountains experience heavy snowfall and blizzards, with the lowest mountain pass through them being southern Shibar pass (9,000 feet) where the Hindu Kush range terminates.&lt;ref name="Clements2003p109"/&gt; Other mountain passes being generally about 12,000 feet or higher.&lt;ref name="Clements2003p109"/&gt; They become passable in late spring and summer.

The mountains of the Hindu Kush range diminish in height as they stretch westward. Near Kabul, in the west, they attain heights of {{convert|3,500|to|4,000|m|ft|sp=us}}; in the east they extend from {{convert|4,500|to|6,000|m|ft|sp=us}}. The average altitude of the Hindu Kush is {{convert|4,500|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="Macnab"&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the roof of the world|last1=Scott-Macnab|first1=David|volume=|year=1994|publisher=Reader's Digest Assiciation Ldt.|location=London|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindu Kush system stretches about {{convert|966|km|mi}} laterally,&lt;ref name="Macnab"/&gt; and its median north-south measurement is about {{convert|240|km|mi}}. Only about {{convert|600|km|mi}} of the Hindu Kush system is called the ''Hindu Kush mountains''. The rest of the system consists of numerous smaller mountain ranges. [[River]]s that flow from the mountain system include the Helmand River, the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Hari River]] and the Kabul River, watersheds for the [[Sistan Basin]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The lower Sistan basin gets little rainfall (~50 mm per year) and the main source of water is the [[Helmand River]] which brings snowmelt water from the southern Hindu Kush. The smaller Khash, the Farah and the Arashkan (Harut) rivers bring water from the western Hindu Kush. The basin of these rivers serves the ecology and economy of the region west to Hindu Kush, but the water flow in these rivers fluctuates severely and has been a historical problem for any settlement. Extreme and extended droughts have been common.&lt;ref&gt;[http://postconflict.unep.ch/publications/sistan.pdf History of Environmental Change in the Sistan Basin], UNEP, United Nations, pages 5, 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindu Kush are orographically described in several parts.&lt;ref name=iranicahk&gt;{{cite book|author=Ehsan Yarshater|title=Encyclopædia Iranica|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hindu-kush|year=2003|publisher=The Encyclopaedia Iranica Foundation|isbn=978-0-933273-76-4|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; The western Hindu Kush, states Yarshater, rises to over 5,100 meters and stretches between Darra-ye Sekari and the Shibar Pass in the west and the Khawak Pass in the east.&lt;ref name=iranicahk/&gt; The central Hindu Kush rising over 6,800 meters has numerous spurs between the Khawak Pass in the east and the Durāh Pass in the west. The eastern Hindu Kush with peaks over 7,000 meter extends from the Durāh Pass to the Baroghil Pass at the border between northeastern Afghanistan and north Pakistan. The ridges between Khawak Pass and Badakshan is over 5,800 meters and is called the Kaja Mohammed range.&lt;ref name=iranicahk/&gt;

The Hindu Kush, states Yarshater, are a part of the "young Eurasian mountain range consisting of metamorphic rocks such as schist, gneiss and marble, as well as of intrusives such as granite, diorite of different age and size". The northern regions of the Hindu Kush witness Himalayan winter and have glaciers, while its southeastern end witness the fringe of Indian subcontinent summer monsoons.&lt;ref name=iranicahk/&gt; From about 1,300 to 2,300 meter, states Yarshater, "sklerophyllous forests are predominant with Quercus and Olea (wild olive); above that up to a height of about 3,300 m one finds coniferous forests with cedars, Picea, Abies, Pinus, and junipers". The inner valleys of the Hindu Kush see little rain and have desert vegetation.&lt;ref name=iranicahk/&gt;

Numerous high passes ("''kotal''") transect the mountains, forming a strategically important network for the transit of caravans. The most important mountain pass is the [[Salang Pass]] (Kotal-e Salang) (3,878&amp;nbsp;m); it links Kabul and points south of it to northern Afghanistan. The completion of a tunnel within this pass in 1964 reduced travel time between Kabul and the north to a few hours. Previously access to the north through the [[Kotal-e Shibar]] (3,260&amp;nbsp;m) took three days.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The [[Salang Tunnel]] at 3,363&amp;nbsp;m and the extensive network of galleries on the approach roads were constructed with Soviet financial and technological assistance and involved drilling 1.7 miles through the heart of the Hindu Kush. The Salang tunnel is on Afghani Highway 76, northwest of [[Gulbahar, Afghanistan|Golbahar]] town, and has been an active area of armed conflict with various parties trying to control it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Laffin|title=The World in Conflict: War Annual 8 : Contemporary Warfare Described and Analysed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BncAAAAMAAJ |year=1997|publisher=Brassey's|isbn=978-1-85753-216-6|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These mountainous areas are mostly barren, or at the most sparsely sprinkled with trees and stunted bushes. Very ancient mines producing [[lapis lazuli]] are found in Kowkcheh Valley, while gem-grade [[emerald]]s are found north of Kabul in the valley of the Panjsher River and some of its tributaries. According to Walter Schumann, the West Hindu Kush mountains have been the source of finest Lapis Lazuli for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Schumann|title=Gemstones of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V9PqVxpxeiEC&amp;pg=PA188 |year=2009|publisher=Sterling |isbn=978-1-4027-6829-3|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Hindu Kush===
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
The Eastern Hindu Kush range, also known as the High Hindu Kush range, is mostly located in northern Pakistan and the [[Nuristan]] and [[Badakhshan]] provinces of Afghanistan. The Chitral District of Pakistan is home to [[Tirich Mir]], [[Noshaq]], and [[Istoro Nal]], the highest peaks in the Hindu Kush. The range also extends into [[Ghizar]], [[Yasin Valley]], and [[Ishkoman]] in Pakistan's Northern Areas.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[Chitral]], Pakistan, is considered to be the pinnacle of the Hindu Kush region. The highest peaks, as well as countless passes and massive glaciers, are located in this region. The [[Chiantar]], [[Kurambar]], and [[Terich]] [[glacier]]s are amongst the most extensive in the Hindu Kush and the meltwater from these glaciers form the [[Kunar River]], which eventually flows south into Afghanistan and joins the [[Landai Sin River|Bashgal]], [[Panjshir River|Panjshir]], and eventually the much smaller [[Kabul River]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In 1017, the Iranian Islamic historian [[Al-Biruni]] was deported after a war that Mahmud of Ghazni won,&lt;ref name=unescoalbe&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000748/074875eo.pdf Al-Biruni] Bobojan Gafurov (June 1974), ''The Courier Journal'', UNESCO, page 13&lt;/ref&gt; to the northwest Indian subcontinent under Mahmud's rule. Al Biruni stayed in the region for about fifteen years, learnt Sanskrit, and translated many Indian texts, and wrote about Indian society, culture, sciences, and religion in Persian and Arabic. He stayed for some time in the Hindu Kush region, particularly near Kabul. In 1019, he recorded and described a solar eclipse in what is the modern era [[Laghman Province]] of Afghanistan through which Hindu Kush pass.&lt;ref name=unescoalbe/&gt; Al Biruni also wrote about early history of the Hindu Kush region and Kabul kings, who ruled the region long before he arrived, but this history is inconsistent with other records available from that era.&lt;ref name=wink124/&gt; Al Biruni was supported by Sultan Mahmud.&lt;ref name=unescoalbe/&gt; Al Biruni found it difficult to get access to Indian literature locally in the Hindu Kush area, and to explain this he wrote, "Mahmud utterly ruined the prosperity of the country, and performed wonderful exploits by which the Hindus became the atoms scattered in all directions, and like a tale of old in the mouth of the people. (...) This is the reason, too, why Hindu sciences have retired far from those parts of the country conquered by us, and have fled to places which our hand cannot yet reach, to [[Kashmir]], [[Varanasi|Benares]] and other places".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=William J.

====Slavery====
Slavery, as with all major ancient and medieval societies, has been a part of [[Central Asia]] and [[South Asia]] history. The [[Hindu]] Kush mountain passes connected the slave markets of Central Asia with slaves seized in South Asia.&lt;ref name=levi277&gt;Scott C.

The practice of raiding tribes, hunting, and kidnapping people for slave trading continued through the 19th century, at an extensive scale, around the Hindu Kush. According to a British Anti-Slavery Society report of 1874, the Governor of Faizabad, Mir Ghulam Bey, kept 8,000 horses and cavalry men who routinely captured non-Muslim infidels (kafir) as well as Shia Muslims as slaves. Others alleged to be involved in slave trade were feudal lords such as Ameer Sheer Ali. The isolated communities in the Hindu Kush were one of the targets of these slave hunting expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Junius P.

[[File:Afghanistan 18.jpg|thumb|275px|Landscape of Afghanistan with a [[T-62]] in the foreground.]]
In early 19th century, the Sikh Empire expanded under [[Ranjit Singh]] in the northwest till the Hindu Kush range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. S.

The Hindu Kush served as a geographical barrier to the [[British empire]], leading to paucity of information and scarce direct interaction between the British colonial officials and Central Asian peoples. The British had to rely on tribal chiefs, Sadozai and Barakzai noblemen for information, and they generally downplayed the reports of slavery and other violence for geo-political strategic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan L.

In the colonial era, the Hindu Kush were considered, informally, the dividing line between Russian and British areas of influence in Afghanistan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2808">'''Horticultural fleece''' is a thin, unwoven, [[polypropylene]] fabric which is used as a floating [[mulch]] to protect both late and early crops and delicate plants from cold weather and frost, as well as insect pests during the normal growing season. It admits light, air and rain but creates a [[microclimate]] around the developing plants, allowing them to grow faster than the unprotected crops.&lt;ref name="RHS"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080612233654/http://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profiles0201/fleece.asp] British [[Royal Horticultural Society]] website page ''Using horticultural fleece on early crops'' (Archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of use==
Available in rolls of various widths, the fleece is laid across sown seedbeds or on the top of juvenile plants.&lt;ref name="Blog"&gt;[http://www.wbnnorthhills.org/2008/11/horticultural-fleece.html] wbnnorthhills, horticultural blog&lt;/ref&gt; If fleece covers rows it is known as a kind of [[row cover]]. The edges may be secured with pegs, soil bags, or other weights if the site is small or not too exposed to winds, or buried in slit trenches. It will stretch slightly in use, which allows the plants to grow.&lt;ref name="Blog"/&gt; For taller plants grown in rows or blocks, heavy-duty fleece can be used to fashion a form of "[[cloche (agriculture)|cloche]]", i.e. a small tent structure. When used as a protection against wind the fleece is wrapped around, or covered over the delicate plants to protect them from frost and  cold wind.

==Uses==
* Extending the growing season for vegetables by allowing earlier sowings in spring and later cropping in autumn&lt;ref name="RHS"/&gt;
* [[Cold hardening|Hardening-off]] seedlings before [[transplanting]] them&lt;ref name="RHS"/&gt;
* Protecting winter crops, allowing them to produce softer, more palatable growth than unprotected plants&lt;ref name="RHS"/&gt;
* Providing extra warmth for crops of borderline hardiness&lt;ref name="RHS"/&gt;
* Winter protection for ornamental plants and fruit blossom&lt;ref name="RHSfruit"&gt;[http://www.rhs.org.uk/advicesearch/Profile.aspx?pid=275 Fruit: protecting from frost / Royal Horticultural Society] British [[Royal Horticultural Society]] website page ''Protecting fruit from frost''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Protection from pests such as pigeons,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gardenerstips.co.uk/blog/flowers/use-horticultural-fleece/ Gardeners' Tips blog]&lt;/ref&gt; rabbits, [[carrot fly]],&lt;ref name="RHScarrotfly"&gt;[http://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profiles0500/carrot.asp Advice / Royal Horticultural Society] British [[Royal Horticultural Society]] website page ''Carrot fly (''Psila rosae'')''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pieris rapae|small white]] and [[large white]] butterflies, etc.&lt;ref name="Blog"/&gt; flea beetles, cabbage loopers, and many other common garden pests.

'''Mona''' ({{lang-es|Isla de la Mona}}) is the third-largest island of the [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[Geography of Puerto Rico|archipelago]], after the main island of Puerto Rico and [[Vieques]]. It is the largest of three islands in the [[Mona Passage]], a strait between the [[Dominican Republic]] and Puerto Rico, the others being [[Monito Island]] and [[Desecheo Island]]. It measures about 7 miles by 4 miles (11&amp;nbsp;km by 7&amp;nbsp;km), and lies {{convert|41|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Puerto Rico, of which it is administratively a part. It is one of two islands that make up the [[Isla de Mona e Islote Monito]] Barrio of [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico]].

The island is managed as the '''Reserva Natural Isla de Mona''' ({{lang-en|'''Mona Island Nature Reserve'''}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://drna.pr.gov/historico/oficinas/oficina-de-prensa-y-comunicaciones/hojas-informativas/Hoja%20informativa%20sobre%20la%20Reserva%20Natural%20Isla%20de%20Mona.doc?set_language=es-pr&amp;cl=es-pr |title=Reserva Natural Isla de Mona |date= |access-date=9 June 2016 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mona Island Nature Reserve}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are no native inhabitants; only rangers and biologists from Puerto Rico's [[Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (Puerto Rico)|Department of Natural and Environmental Resources]] reside on the island, to manage visitors and take part in research projects.

==History==

===Pre-Columbian history===
Mona Island is believed to have been originally settled by the [[Taíno]]. An archeological excavation during the 1980s discovered many [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] objects on the island that helped support historians' theories of the island's first inhabitants. Stone tools found in a rock shelter have been dated to around 3000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/outline/06-carib_prehistory/index.htm Caribbean Prehistory], US National Park Service website&lt;/ref&gt; Much later the island was settled by the [[Taínos]] and remained so until the arrival of the Spanish in the 15th century.

===Colonial period===

On November 19, 1493, during his second voyage to the [[New World]], [[Christopher Columbus]] encountered the island now known as Puerto Rico, which the natives called ''Borinquen'' (or ''Borikén'' according to some historians), and which Columbus named ''San Juan Bautista'' (''Saint John the Baptist''). Within hours of setting foot in Puerto Rico, Columbus and his ships headed west to Hispaniola, where he expected to meet several crewmembers who had remained behind from his first voyage.  As he left Puerto Rico, he reputedly became the first European to sight the island on September 24, 1494, which was claimed for Spain. The name ''Mona'' derives from the Taíno name ''Ámona'', bestowed by the natives in honor of the ruling ''[[Cacique]]'' or chief of the island. However, one amateur archaeologist (Rex Cauldwell) who has studied the Mona Island/Columbus sighting for over 14 years puts this in dispute with the following logic: "Mona island is to the southwest corner of PR. Columbus is in a bay on the northwest corner. He is to sail from there straight across to the north coast of Hispaniola. Why would he sail south to where he has already been and then sail north again to Hispaniola? This is illogical. Mona Island was probably picked by armchair historians because it is the only island in the passage between Puerto Rico and Hispaniola that is drawn on most maps.  It is more logical that when Columbus left the northwest coast of Puerto Rico, the small island he saw had to be Desecheo—a famous diving destination not far off the northwest coast of PR. It was never considered by armchair authors because it is small, barren, and of no interest, it is not drawn on most maps." In 1502, Fray [[Nicolás de Ovando]] was sent to ''Isla de la Mona'' to keep an eye, from a safe distance, on the native revolts occurring in Hispaniola. With a group of 2,000 [[Spanish people|Spanish]] settlers, Ovando was left in charge of creating a permanent settlement on the island. Due to its small size and location, the island proved inadequate to accommodate such a large settlement, and food became scarce as shipments from Hispaniola and Puerto Rico were received infrequently.

[[Juan Ponce de León]], who accompanied Columbus on his first two voyages, became the first ruling [[governor of Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vicente Yañez Pinzón]] was appointed as the first [[governor of Puerto Rico]] but he never arrived on the island&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1515, after some wrangling, Ferdinand II was able to reclaim the island from [[Diego Colón]], Viceroy of the Indies. By then, Isla de la Mona was an important point of trade between Spain and the rest of Latin America, as well as a rest stop for the crews of boats carrying slaves. With his possession of the island, King Ferdinand II gave the resident Taínos two options if they wished to continue living on the island: they could work by fishing, making [[hammock]]s and cultivating plants, or they could become miners and help in the mining of guano and other minerals. Realizing that mining would require intense labor, the majority of inhabitants chose to work as fishermen and farmers. By accepting this option, they also were exempted from paying imposed taxes, and were able to avoid the hard labor many other natives endured in mines. In time, natives from other neighboring islands were brought to Mona Island to assist with labor.

After the death of Ferdinand II in 1516, ownership of the island was transferred to Cardenal Cisneros. The island changed ownership again in 1520, when Francisco de Barrionuevo became the island's new landlord. By 1524, [[Alonso Manso]], [[bishop]] of Puerto Rico, had become interested in gaining personal wealth, and he accused Barrionuevo, among others, of various crimes under the Spanish justice system of the time. Because of this situation, Barrionuevo exiled himself to one of Spain's colonies in South America, taking many Taínos along with him, and leaving the island practically deserted.

By 1522, ships from other major sea powers such as England, France, and the Netherlands began to arrive at Isla de la Mona to replenish supplies for their transatlantic voyages. The island also provided them and [[piracy|pirates]] with a refuge from which they could attack and plunder Spanish galleons.

In 1561, during an audience held in [[Santo Domingo]], it was recommended that Isla de la Mona should become a part of that colony (which at the time occupied the eastern half of Hispaniola). The reasons offered were simply that the island was closer to Santo Domingo (presently the Dominican Republic) than to Puerto Rico, and that it had a small population which could help the colony's economy in overall agricultural production. However, the petition was turned down and the island continued to remain politically part of Puerto Rico.

In 1583, the Spanish archbishop of Puerto Rico received royal permission to bring Christianity to Mona Island. However, by this time most Taínos remaining on the island had either died or fled to mainland Puerto Rico due to repeated raiding by European (especially French) ships. From the end of the 16th century up until the mid-19th century the island was largely abandoned by the colonial authorities. It seems to have been sporadically inhabited, although records from this period are somewhat sketchy. It continued to be used as a refuge by pirates and privateers, including the notorious [[Captain Kidd]] who hid out there in 1699.&lt;ref name=herald&gt;[http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2003/vol7n30/HuntersFlock-en.html Hunters Flock To Puerto Rico's Remote And Rugged Mona Island], ''Puerto Rico Herald'', June 18, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The island's circumstances changed in the mid-19th century when it became the site of commercial [[guano]] mining operations. Various companies were granted licenses to extract the bat and seagull guano (a valuable fertilizer and key strategic commodity for the production of gunpowder) from the island's caves. Mining continued until 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caves.org/pub/journal/PDF/V60/V60N2-Frank-History.pdf "History of the guano mining industry, Isla de Mona, Puerto Rico"], Edward F. Frank&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Caves ====
[[File:Mona Island cave no.3.jpg|thumb|Mona Island cave]]
Around 200 caves are on the island with thousands of native art designs and the marks and names made by early Spanish explorers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/07/cave-art-caribbean-mona-island-first-contact-archaeology|title=Cave Walls Record Early Encounters Between Old World and New|date=2016-07-19|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Jago|last2=Samson|first2=Alice V.M.|last3=Nieves|first3=Miguel A.|last4=Lace|first4=Michael J.|last5=Caamaño-Dones|first5=Josué|last6=Cartwright|first6=Caroline|last7=Kambesis|first7=Patricia N.|last8=Frese|first8=Laura del Olmo|date=2016-08-01|title=‘The Mona Chronicle’: the archaeology of early religious encounter in the New World|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0003598X16001034|journal=Antiquity|volume=90|issue=352|pages=1054–1071|doi=10.15184/aqy.2016.103|issn=1745-1744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[File:monaisland.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mona Island Lighthouse]] and [[Mona Island Tramway]]]]
With the 1898 [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]], Isla de la Mona, along with the rest of Puerto Rico, was handed by Spain to the United States. Within two years of occupation, the [[Mona Island Light]], left in an unfinished state since the beginning of the [[Spanish–American War]], was completed and began operation. The lighthouse was, contrary to common opinion, not designed by famous French engineer [[Gustave Eiffel]] (who designed the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris), but the Spanish engineer Rafael Ravena in 1886. It was accessible by the [[Mona Island Tramway]] from the beach and remained in continuous operation until 1976 when it was replaced by a newer automated light near the centre of the island.&lt;ref Name="Anderson"&gt;Kraig Anderson: [http://lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=1143 ''Isla de Mona Lighthouse.''] Retrieved on 25 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 1919 the island was declared an "Insular Forest of Puerto Rico", under the auspices of the U.S. Forest Law #22.

During [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] the island had a history of smuggling, with its geographic location making it a prime location for [[rum runners]] to smuggle rum, bourbon, and other liquor. In 1923, a stash of liquor, drugs, and perfumes, reportedly from the French islands of [[Martinique]] and [[Saint Martin]] and worth US$75,000, was found in a cave by customs officials.

In 1942, at the height of World War II, a German submarine bombarded the southern coast of the island.&lt;ref&gt;[[Battle of the Caribbean]]&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the few incidents of that war in the Caribbean. On June 4th, 1942 the [[oil tanker]] [[MV C.O. Stillman]] that was sunk by the German submarine {{GS|U-68|1940|2}} {{convert|41|nmi|km}} southwest of Isla de Mona.&lt;ref name=Esso-261&gt;{{harvnb|Esso|1946|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1945 to 1955 Mona Island was leased to the [[U.S. Air Force]] as a military exercise area.

Since 1941 the island has also been used for camping and hunting goats and wild boar. In 1960 a small ranger post was established to monitor the island, operated by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources.

In July 1972 the Environmental Quality Board of Puerto Rico, because of growing interest in the development of the islands, made a full scientific assessment of Mona and Monita using a local team of volunteer scientists. A two-volume report with maps of natural and historic features was produced.&lt;ref&gt;''Mona and Monito Islands an Assessment of their Natural and Historical Resources'', assessment team directed by Frank H. Wadsworth, maps by John J. Whelan&lt;/ref&gt;  It evaluated the climate, geology and mineral resources, soils, water resources, archaeology, vegetation, animals and insects, and pelagic life around the island. Shortly thereafter geotechnical and bathymetry studies were conducted by engineering firms to determine the feasibility of using Mona as a deepwater terminal for transferring oil from supertankers to smaller tankers which would continue to the mainland US; this plan was never implemented.

In 1981, the [[Mona Island Lighthouse]] was listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]] as "Faro de la Isla de la Mona".

On February 15, 1985, the passenger-cargo ferry {{MV|A Regina||6}} ran aground on a reef on the southeastern side of Mona Island. While there were no deaths nor serious injuries, 143 passengers and 72 crew members landed on Mona Island to await rescue. The wreck of the ship was removed from the reef in 1990.

In 1993, the island (perhaps all of it), as "Isla de la Mona", was listed on the National Register.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;

==Geography==

Mona has an area of about {{convert|22|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} and lies {{convert|41|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of the main island of Puerto Rico, {{convert|38|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of the [[Dominican Republic]], and {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Desecheo Island]], another island in the [[Mona Passage]].

Mona has been designated an ecological reserve by the Puerto Rican government and is not permanently inhabited. The US [[census]] of 2000 reports six housing units, but a population of zero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&amp;_box_head_nbr=GCT-PH1&amp;format=CO-2&amp;geo_id=05000US72097 US Census (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; The island is a ward (''[[barrio]]'') of the [[Municipalities of Puerto Rico|municipality]] of [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico|Mayagüez]], together with [[Monito Island]] 3.1&amp;nbsp;mi (5&amp;nbsp;km) northwest (''Isla de Mona e Islote Monito barrio''). This is the largest ward of Mayagüez by area, and the only one without permanent population. The total land area of both islands in the barrio is about 21.98&amp;nbsp;square miles (56.93&amp;nbsp;km²) (Mona Island 21.924&amp;nbsp;square miles [56.783&amp;nbsp;km²] and nearby Monito Island 0.057&amp;nbsp;square miles [0.147&amp;nbsp;km²]), and it comprises 28.3 percent of the total land area of the municipality of Mayagüez. [[Desecheo Island]], 30&amp;nbsp;mi (49&amp;nbsp;km) to the northeast, is part of Sabanetas barrio.

Mona is a mainly flat plateau surrounded by sea cliffs. It is composed of [[dolomite]] and [[limestone]] with many [[caves]] found throughout.  With an arid [[climate]] and untouched by human development, many [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species inhabit the island, such as the [[Mona ground iguana]] (Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri). Its topography, ecology, and modern history are similar to that of [[Navassa Island]], a small limestone island located in the [[Jamaica Channel]], between [[Jamaica]] and [[Haiti]].

===Land cover===
Four types of land cover can be identified:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gobierno.pr/DRNA/ReservasNaturales/Islas/IslaMona/Isla_MonaV.htm Departamento de Recursos Naturales y Ambientales website] (Puerto Rican Department of Natural and Environmental Resources; in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Cactus (4.35&amp;nbsp;square miles) (11.27&amp;nbsp;km²)
* Highland Forest (15.55&amp;nbsp;square miles) (40.28&amp;nbsp;km²)
* Central Depression Forest (0.57&amp;nbsp;square miles) (1.47&amp;nbsp;km²)
* Coastal Forest (1.46&amp;nbsp;square miles) (3.77&amp;nbsp;km²)

===Beaches===

Mona Island hosts a large and increasing hawksbill sea turtle ([[Eretmochelys imbricata]]) rookery with over 1,500 clutches laid annually on its beaches. The island is recognized as one of the principal sites for hawksbill nesting in the Wider Caribbean and Western Atlantic region, along with Mexico ([[Yucatán peninsula]] beaches), Barbados, Panama ([[Bocas del Toro Archipelago|Bocas del Toro]]), and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iacseaturtle.org/eng-docs/publicaciones/Conservacion-Carey-ing.pdf "Conservation Status of Hawksbill Turtles in the Wider Caribbean, Western Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Regions"], Campbell, C.L. 2014.

The only campsites are at Playa de Pájaros and Playa Sardinera. In addition, Playa Uveros, Pájaros, Playa Mujeres and Playa Brava are important to visitors.

==Mona Island today==
[[File:Playa Pajaros, Mona, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|200px|Buildings on Playa Pájaros on the south coast]]
The island presently serves as a retreat for Puerto Ricans and nature enthusiasts from all around the world, and has also become a popular destination for Puerto Rican [[Scouting in Puerto Rico|Boy]] and [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]]. Due to the islands' unique topography, ecology and location, Mona, Desecheo and Monito have been nicknamed "The [[Galápagos Islands]] of the Caribbean". Scientists, ecologists, and students have visited Mona Island to explore its distinct ecosystem, which includes the endemic [[Mona Ground Iguana]]. The island is also home to many cave drawings that were left behind by the island's original inhabitants. Remains of the [[guano]] mining industry can also be seen.

An [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]-certified [[Mona Airport|airport]] that can handle small aircraft was built by the Puerto Rican government. This airport has no [[ICAO]] or [[IATA]] code. The [[United States Coast Guard]] is able to provide transportation with helicopter flights from [[Rafael Hernández Airport]] in Aguadilla, to help with medicines and first aid equipment; they also fly whenever an emergency requiring hospitalization occurs. Private and commercial planes require a special permit issued by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources to use the airport's facilities.

The most common form of transportation is by private yacht, though commercial excursions are available from [[Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico|Cabo Rojo]] for small groups of up to twelve people traveling together.

Hunting is permitted in season in order to control the population growth of non-indigenous species (goats, pigs and wild cats) because they can represent a threat to various endangered species. The hunting season usually commences in December and ends in April. Camping is allowed from May through November.

In recent years, the island has become a major drop-off point especially for [[Dominican people (Dominican Republic)|Dominicans]], as well as [[Haitian people|Haitians]] and [[Cuban people|Cubans]] trying to reach Puerto Rico illegally. As a U.S. [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|Commonwealth]], Puerto Rico is seen by many illegal migrants as a stepping stone to the United States. On the other hand, they are usually deported immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dominicantoday.com/app/article.aspx?id=16234 "Cubans using Haitian, Dominican soil to reach Puerto Rico concerns the U.S."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112075240/http://www.dominicantoday.com/app/article.aspx?id=16234 |date=2007-11-12 }}, ''Dominican Today'', accessed 20 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and hydrography==
[[File:DEM Baikal lake.png|thumb|left|A [[digital elevation model]] of Lake Baikal region]]
[[File:Yeniseirivermap.png|thumb|left|The [[Yenisei River]] basin, which includes Lake Baikal]]
Lake Baikal is in a rift valley, created by the [[Baikal Rift Zone]], where the Earth's crust is slowly pulling apart.&lt;ref name="oddities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF9/986.html|title=The Oddities of Lake Baikal|publisher=Alaska Science Forum |accessdate=7 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At {{convert|636|km|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|79|km|abbr=on}} wide, Lake Baikal has the largest surface area of any freshwater lake in Asia, at {{convert|31722|km2|abbr=on}}, and is the deepest lake in the world at {{convert|1642|m|abbr=on}}. The bottom of the lake is {{convert|1186.5|m|abbr=on}} below sea level, but below this lies some {{convert|7|km|abbr=on}} of [[sediment]], placing the rift floor some {{convert|8|-|11|km|abbr=on}} below the surface, the deepest continental [[rift]] on Earth.&lt;ref name="oddities"/&gt; In geological terms, the rift is young and active – it widens about 2&amp;nbsp;cm (0.8&amp;nbsp;in) per year. The fault zone is also seismically active; hot springs occur in the area and notable [[earthquake]]s happen every few years. The lake is divided into three basins: North, Central, and South, with depths about {{convert|900|m|abbr=on}}, {{convert|1600|m|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|1400|m|abbr=on}}, respectively. Fault-controlled accommodation zones rising to depths about {{convert|300|m|abbr=on}} separate the basins. The North and Central basins are separated by [[Academician Ridge]], while the area around the Selenga Delta and the Buguldeika Saddle separates the Central and South basins. The lake drains into the [[Angara River|Angara]] tributary of the [[Yenisei]]. Notable landforms include [[Cape Ryty]] on Baikal's northwest coast.

Baikal's age is estimated at 25–30 million years, making it the most [[ancient lake]] in [[geology|geological]] history.&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ScienceDaily2017/&gt; It is unique among large, high-latitude lakes, as its sediments have not been scoured by overriding continental ice sheets. Russian, U.S., and Japanese cooperative studies of deep-drilling core sediments in the 1990s provide a detailed record of climatic variation over the past 6.7 million years.&lt;ref&gt;Kravchinsky, V.A., M.A. Krainov, M.E.

The lake is completely surrounded by mountains. The [[Baikal Mountains]] on the north shore, the [[Barguzin Range]] on the northeastern shore, and the [[taiga]] are technically protected as a national park. It contains 27 islands; the largest, [[Olkhon]], is {{convert|72|km|abbr=on}} long and is the third-largest lake-bound island in the world.

It is drained through a single outlet, the Angara River.

===Water characteristics===
[[File:Baikal 1739.jpg|thumb|Lake Baikal's water is very clear]]

Baikal is one of the clearest lakes in the world.&lt;ref name=Jung2004/&gt; During the winter in open sections the water transparency can be as much as {{convert|30-40|m|ft|abbr=on}}, but during the summer it is typically {{convert|5-8|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=FEOW&gt;Freshwater Ecoregions of the World (2008). ''[http://www.feow.org/ecoregions/details/lake_baikal Lake Baikal.]'' Retrieved 16 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Baikal is rich in oxygen, even in deep sections,&lt;ref name=FEOW/&gt; which separates it from the distinctly [[Stratification (water)|stratified]] bodies of water such as [[Lake Tanganyika]] and the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Hutter| author2=Yongqi | author3=Chubarenko | year=2011 | title=Physics of Lakes: Foundation of the Mathematical and Physical Background | volume=1 | page=11 | isbn=978-3-642-15178-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Unique body of water | url=http://www.blackseascene.net/content/content.asp?menu=0040032_000000 | publisher=Black Sea Scene | accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lake Baikal, the water temperature varies significantly depending on location, depth, and time of the year. During the winter and spring, the surface freezes for 4–5 months; from early January to May–June (latest in the north), the entire lake surface is covered in ice.&lt;ref name=baikalice&gt;{{cite web| title=Ice Conditions | url=http://www.bww.irk.ru/baikalclimate/baikalice.html | publisher=bww.irk.ru | accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, the ice reaches a thickness of {{convert|0.5|to(-)|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Baikal seal | url=http://baikal.ru/en/baikal/excursion/nerpa.html | publisher=baikal.ru | accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in some places with [[hummock]]s, it can be more than {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=baikalice/&gt; During this period, the temperature slowly increases with depth in the lake, being coldest near the ice-covered surface at around freezing, and reaching about {{convert|3.5-3.8|C|F|abbr=on}} at a depth of {{convert|200-250|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Gurulev&gt;{{cite web| author=Gurulev, S.A. | title=Temperature of Lake Baikal Water | url=http://www.bww.irk.ru/baikalwater/temperature.html | publisher=bww.irk.ru | accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the surface ice breaks up, the surface water is slowly warmed up by the sun, and in May–June, the upper circa {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} becomes homothermic (same temperature throughout) at around {{convert|4|C|F|abbr=on}} because of water mixing.&lt;ref name=FEOW/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gurulev/&gt; The sun continues to heat up the surface layer, and at the peak in August can reach up to about {{convert|16|C|F|abbr=on}} in the main sections&lt;ref name=Gurulev/&gt; and {{convert|20-24|C|F|abbr=on}} in shallow bays in the southern half of the lake.&lt;ref name=FEOW/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pomazkina2012&gt;{{cite journal| author=Pomazkina, G.; L. Kravtsova; and E. Sorokovikova | title=Structure of epiphyton communities on Lake Baikal submerged macrophytes | year=2012 | journal=Limnological Review | volume=12 | issue=1 | pages=19–27 | doi=10.2478/v10194-011-0041-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the pattern is inverted compared to the winter and spring, as the water temperature falls with increasing depth. As the autumn begins, the surface temperature falls again and a second homothermic period at around {{convert|4|C|F|abbr=on}} of the upper circa {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} occurs in October–November.&lt;ref name=FEOW/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gurulev/&gt; In the deepest parts of the lake, from about {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the temperature is very stable at {{convert|3.1-3.4|C|F|abbr=on}} with only minor annual variations.&lt;ref name=Gurulev/&gt;

The average surface temperature has risen by almost 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) in the last 50 years, resulting in a shorter period where the lake is covered by ice.&lt;ref name=ScienceDaily2017/&gt; At some locations, [[hydrothermal vent]]s with water that can be about {{convert|50|C|F|abbr=on}} have been found. These are mostly in deep water, but locally have also been found in relatively shallow water. They have very little effect on the lake's temperature because of its huge volume.&lt;ref name=Gurulev/&gt;

Stormy weather on the lake is common, especially during the summer and fall, and can result in waves as high as {{convert|4.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=FEOW/&gt;

==Fauna and flora==
[[File:Baikal-seal 4747-pho.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Baikal seal]] is endemic to Lake Baikal.]]
Lake Baikal is rich in [[biodiversity]]. It hosts more than 1,000 species of plants and 2,500 species of animals based on current knowledge, but the actual figures for both groups are believed to be significantly higher.&lt;ref name="FEOW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eulimnogammarus"&gt;Rivarola-Duartea; Otto; Jühling; Schreiber; Bedulina; Jakob; Gurkov; Axenov-Gribanov; Sahyoun; Lucassen; Hackermüller; Hoffmann; Sartoris; Pörtner; Timofeyev; Luckenbach; and Stadler (2014).

===Invertebrates===
The lake hosts a rich endemic fauna of invertebrates. The [[copepod]] ''[[Epischura baikalensis]]'' is endemic to Lake Baikal and the dominating [[zooplankton]] species there, making up 80 to 90% of total [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baikal.mobi/ |title=Зоопланктон в экосистеме озера Байкал / О Байкале.ру — Байкал.

Among the most diverse invertebrate groups are the [[amphipod]] and [[ostracod]] crustaceans, [[freshwater snail]]s, [[annelid]] worms and [[turbellaria]]n worms:

====Amphipod and ostracod crustaceans====
[[File:Baikal-Flohkrebs.jpg|thumb|A "giant" ''Brachyuropus reicherti'' ([[Acanthogammaridae]]) amphipod caught during [[ice fishing]] in the lake. Red-orange is its natural, living coloration]]

More than 350 species and subspecies of amphipods are endemic to the lake.&lt;ref name=Eulimnogammarus/&gt; They are exceptionally diverse in [[ecology]] and appearance, ranging from the pelagic ''[[Macrohectopus]]'' to the relatively large deep-water ''[[Abyssogammarus]]'' and ''[[Garjajewia]]'', the tiny herbivorous ''[[Micruropus]]'', and the parasitic ''[[Pachyschesis]]'' (parasitic on other amphipods).&lt;ref name=Sherbakov&gt;Sherbakov; Kamaltynov; Ogarkov; and Verheyen (1998).

Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 10(2): 160-167&lt;/ref&gt; The "gigantism" of some Baikal amphipods, which has been compared to that seen in Antarctic amphipods, has been linked to the high level of dissolved oxygen in the lake.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News (13 May 1999). ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/342906.stm Oxygen boosts polar giants.]'' Retrieved 17 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the "giants" are several species of spiny ''Acanthogammarus'' and ''Brachyuropus'' ([[Acanthogammaridae]]) found at both shallow and deep depths.&lt;ref name=Acanthogammarus&gt;Daneliya, M.E.; Kamaltynov, R.M.; and Väinölä, R.

==History==
The Baikal area, sometimes known as [[Baikalia]], has a long history of human habitation. An early known tribe in the area was the [[Kurykans]].

Located in the former northern territory of the [[Xiongnu]] confederation, Lake Baikal is one site of the [[Han–Xiongnu War]], where the armies of the [[Han dynasty]] pursued and defeated the Xiongnu forces from the second century BC to the first century AD. They recorded that the lake was a "huge sea" (''hanhai'') and designated it the North Sea (''Běihǎi'') of the semimythical [[Four Seas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Chun-shu|last=Chang|title=The Rise of the Chinese Empire: Nation, State, and Imperialism in Early China, ca. 1600 B.C.-A.D. 8|year=2007|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-11533-4|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kurykans, a Siberian tribe who inhabited the area in the sixth century, gave it a name that translates to "much water". Later on, it was called "natural lake" (''Baygal nuur'') by the Buryats and "rich lake" (''Bay göl'') by the Yakuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=W. Bruce|last=Lincoln|title=The Conquest of a Continent: Siberia and the Russians|year=2007|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8922-8|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little was known to Europeans about the lake until Russia expanded into the area in the 17th century. The first [[Russian explorers|Russian explorer]] to reach Lake Baikal was [[Kurbat Ivanov]] in 1643.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irkutsk.org/baikal/research.htm |title=Research of the Baikal |publisher=Irkutsk.org |date=18 January 2006 |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian expansion into the Buryat area around Lake Baikal&lt;ref&gt;George V. Lantzeff and Richard A. Price, 'Eastward to Empire',1973&lt;/ref&gt; in 1628–58 was part of the [[Russian conquest of Siberia]]. It was done first by following the Angara River upstream from [[Yeniseysk]] (founded 1619) and later by moving south from the Lena River. Russians first heard of the Buryats in 1609 at Tomsk. According to folktales related a century after the fact, in 1623, [[Demid Pyanda]], who may have been the first Russian to reach the Lena, crossed from the upper Lena to the Angara and arrived at Yeniseysk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randewy.ru/karta/geogr24.html |script-title=ru:Открытие Русскими Средней И Восточной Сибири |publisher=Randewy.ru |accessdate=2012-01-02|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vikhor Savin (1624) and [[Maksim Perfilyev]] (1626 and 1627–28) explored [[Evenks|Tungus]] country on the lower Angara. To the west, [[Krasnoyarsk]] on the upper Yenisei was founded in 1627. A number of ill-documented expeditions explored eastward from Krasnoyarsk. In 1628, [[Pyotr Beketov]] first encountered a group of Buryats and collected ''[[yasak]]'' ([[tribute]]) from them at the future site of [[Bratsk]]. In 1629, Yakov Khripunov set off from Tomsk to find a rumored silver mine. His men soon began plundering both Russians and natives. They were joined by another band of rioters from Krasnoyarsk, but left the Buryat country when they ran short of food. This made it difficult for other Russians to enter the area. In 1631, Maksim Perfilyev built an ''[[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]]'' at Bratsk. The pacification was moderately successful, but in 1634, Bratsk was destroyed and its garrison killed. In 1635, Bratsk was restored by a punitive expedition under Radukovskii. In 1638, it was besieged unsuccessfully.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In 1638, Perfilyev crossed from the Angara over the Ilim portage to the [[Lena River]] and went downstream as far as [[Olyokminsk]]. Returning, he sailed up the [[Vitim River]] into the area east of Lake Baikal (1640) where he heard reports of the Amur country. In 1641, Verkholensk was founded on the upper Lena. In 1643, [[Kurbat Ivanov]] went further up the Lena and became the first Russian to see Lake Baikal and [[Olkhon Island]]. Half his party under Skorokhodov remained on the lake, reached the [[Upper Angara]] at its northern tip, and wintered on the Barguzin River on the northeast side.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In 1644, Ivan Pokhabov went up the Angara to Baikal, becoming perhaps the first Russian to use this route, which is difficult because of the rapids. He crossed the lake and explored the lower [[Selenge River]]. About 1647, he repeated the trip, obtained guides, and visited a 'Tsetsen Khan' near [[Ulan Bator]]. In 1648, Ivan Galkin built an ''ostrog ''on the Barguzin River which became a center for eastward expansion. In 1652, Vasily Kolesnikov reported from Barguzin that one could reach the Amur country by following the Selenga, Uda, and Khilok Rivers to the future sites of [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]] and [[Nerchinsk]]. In 1653, [[Pyotr Beketov]] took Kolesnikov's route to Lake Irgen west of Chita, and that winter his man Urasov founded Nerchinsk. Next spring, he tried to occupy Nerchensk, but was forced by his men to join [[Russian-Manchu border conflicts|Stephanov]] on the Amur. Nerchinsk was destroyed by the local Tungus, but restored in 1658.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] was built between 1896 and 1902. Construction of the scenic [[Circum-Baikal Railway|railway around the southwestern end of Lake Baikal]] required 200 bridges and 33 tunnels. Until its completion, a [[train ferry]] transported railcars across the lake from [[Port Baikal]] to [[Mysovaya]] for a number of years. The lake became the site of the minor [[Battle of Lake Baikal|engagement]] between the [[Czechoslovak legion]] and the [[Red Army]] in 1918. At times during winter freezes, the lake could be crossed on foot, though at risk of [[frostbite]] and deadly [[hypothermia]] from the cold wind moving unobstructed across flat expanses of ice. In the winter of 1920, the [[Great Siberian Ice March]] occurred, when the retreating [[White movement|White Russian Army]] crossed frozen Lake Baikal. The wind on the exposed lake was so cold, many people died, freezing in place until spring thaw. Beginning in 1956, the impounding of the [[Irkutsk Dam]] on the Angara River raised the level of the lake by {{Convert|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="his"&gt;{{cite web|title=Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station History|url=http://en.irkutskenergo.ru/qa/1008.2.html|publisher=Irkutskenergo|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the railway was built, a large hydrogeographical expedition headed by [[Fedor Kirillovich Drizhenko|F.K. Drizhenko]] produced the first detailed contour map of the lake bed.&lt;ref name="touchstone"/&gt;

==Research==
[[File:Baikal lake Crack in the ice.jpg|thumb|Ice cover survey on the lake]]

Several organizations are carrying out natural research projects on Lake Baikal. Most of them are governmental or associated with governmental organizations. The [[Baikalian Research Centre]] is an independent research organization carrying out environmental educational and research projects at Lake Baikal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baikal-research.org/ Байкальский исследовательский центр] (Baikal Research Centre; in Russian). www.baikal-research.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The lake, nicknamed "the Pearl of Siberia", drew investors from the tourist industry as energy revenues sparked an economic boom.&lt;ref name="Esslemont"&gt;{{cite news|author=Tom Esslemont |date=7 September 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6982271.stm|title="Pearl of Siberia" draws investors|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=4 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viktor Grigorov's Grand Baikal in [[Irkutsk]] is one of the investors, who planned to build three hotels, creating 570 jobs. In 2007, the Russian government declared the Baikal region a [[special economic zone]]. A popular resort in [[Listvyanka, Irkutsky District, Irkutsk Oblast|Listvyanka]] is home to the seven-story Hotel Mayak. At the northern part of the lake, Baikalplan (a German NGO) built together with Russians in 2009 the [[Frolikha Adventure Coastline Track]], a {{convert|100|km|abbr=on|adj=on}}-long [[long-distance trail]] as example for a sustainable development of the region. Baikal was also declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] site in 1996. [[Rosatom]] plans to build a laboratory near Baikal, in conjunction with an international [[uranium]] plant and to invest $2.5 billion in the region and create 2,000 jobs in the city of [[Angarsk]].&lt;ref name="Esslemont"/&gt;

Lake Baikal is a popular destination among tourists from all over the world. According to the Russian Federal State Statistics Service, in 2013, 79,179 foreign tourists visited Irkutsk and Lake Baikal; in 2014, 146,937 visitors. The most popular places to stay by the lake are Listvyanka village, Olkhon Island, Kotelnikovsky cape, Baykalskiy Priboi, [[resort Khakusy]] and Turka village. The popularity of Lake Baikal is growing from year to year, but there is no developed infrastructure in the area. For the quality of service and comfort from the visitor's point of view, Lake Baikal still has a long way to go.

The ice road to Olkhon Island is the only legal ice road on Lake Baikal. The route is prepared by specialists every year and it opens when the ice conditions allow it. In 2015, the ice road to Olkhon was open from February 17 to March 23. The thickness of the ice on the road is about {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on}}, maximum capacity allowed – {{convert|10|t|abbr=on}}; it is open to the public from 9 am to 6 pm. The road through the lake is {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} long and it goes from the village Kurkut on the mainland, to Irkutskaya Guba on Olkhon Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://russianblogger.me/lake-baikal-in-the-winter-driving-on-frozen-lake-baikal/|title=Driving on frozen Lake Baikal in the winter|last=Daniil|first=Timin|date=|website=Russian blogger|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental concerns==

===Baykalsk Pulp and Paper Mill===
[[File:Bajkal'sk paper.jpg|thumb|left|Baykalsk Pulp and Paper Mill in 2008, 5 years before its closure]]
The [[Baykalsk Pulp and Paper Mill]] was constructed in 1966, directly on the shoreline of Lake Baikal. The plant bleached paper using [[chlorine]] and discharged waste directly into Lake Baikal. The decision to construct the plant on the Lake Baikal resulted in strong protests from Soviet scientists; according to them, the ultra-pure water of the lake was a significant resource and should have been used for innovative chemical production (for instance, the production of high-quality viscose for the aeronautics and space industries). The Soviet scientists felt that it was irrational to change Lake Baikal's water quality by beginning paper production on the shore. It was their position that it was also necessary to preserve endemic species of local biota, and to maintain the area around Lake Baikal as a recreation zone &lt;ref&gt;Sobisevich A. V., Snytko V. A.

===Proposed uranium enrichment centre===
In 2006, the Russian government announced plans to build the world's first international uranium enrichment centre at an existing nuclear facility in [[Angarsk]], a city on the [[Angara River|river Angara]] some {{convert|95|km|abbr=on}} downstream from the lake's shores. Critics and environmentalists argued it would be a disaster for the region and are urging the government to reconsider.&lt;ref name=critic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newint.org/columns/currents/2008/05/01/environment/ |title=Saving the Sacred Sea: Russian nuclear plant threatens ancient lake |publisher=Newint.org |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After enrichment, only 10% of the uranium-derived radioactive material would be exported to international customers,&lt;ref name=critic/&gt; leaving 90% near the Lake Baikal region for storage. [[radioactive waste|Uranium tailings]] contain radioactive and toxic materials, which if improperly stored, are potentially dangerous to humans and can contaminate rivers and lakes.&lt;ref name=critic/&gt;

Nonetheless, the enrichment centre was built in the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eng.iuec.ru/|title=The International Uranium Enrichment Center {{!}} JSC IUEC|website=eng.iuec.ru|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other pollution sources===
According to ''[[The Moscow Times]]'' and ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'', an increasing number of an [[invasive species]] of [[algae]] thrives in the lake from hundreds of tons of liquid waste, including fuel and excrement, regularly disposed into the lake by tourist sites, and up to 25,000 tons of liquid waste are disposed of every year by local ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenmbland.com/#!earths-deepest-lake-is-seriously-ill/cbfp|title=StephenMBland|website=StephenMBland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russias-baikal-biggest-lake-in-the-world-becoming-a-swamp/506641.html Russia's Baikal, Biggest Lake in the World, 'Becoming a Swamp']. 8 September 2014 19:35.

==Historical traditions==
[[File:Letts-Popular-Atlas-1883-Russia-in-Asia-Chinese-Empire-etc.jpg|thumb|An 1883 British map using the ''More Baikal'' (Baikal Sea) designation, rather than the conventional ''Ozero Baikal'' (Lake Baikal)]]

In the past, the Baikal was referred to by many Russians as the "Baikal Sea" ({{lang-ru|Море Байкал}}, ''More Baikal''), rather than merely "Lake Baikal" ({{lang-ru|Озеро Байкал}}, ''Ozero Baikal'').&lt;ref name=tooke&gt;{{Cite book

This usage is attested already in the ''Life'' of [[Protopope]] [[Avvakum]] (1621–1682),&lt;ref&gt;"On the Baikal Sea I was in a shipwreck agan" (На Байкалове море паки тонул), in the ''Life of Protopope Avvakum, Written by Himself'' ([[:ru:s:Житие протопопа Аввакума|Житие протопопа Аввакума, им самим написанное]])&lt;/ref&gt; and on the late-17th-century maps by [[Semyon Remezov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=L.

To this day, the strait between the western shore of the Lake and the [[Olkhon]] Island is called ''Maloye More'' (Малое Море), i.e. "the [[Small Sea Strait|Little Sea]]".

Lake Baikal is nicknamed "Older sister of Sister Lakes ([[Lake Khövsgöl]] and Lake Baikal)".&lt;ref&gt;''Lake Baikal: Siberia's Great Lake'' {{ISBN|978-1-84162-294-1}} p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 19th-century traveler T. W. Atkinson, locals in the Lake Baikal Region had the tradition that Christ visited the area:&lt;blockquote&gt;
The people have a tradition in connection with this region which they implicitly believe. They say "that Christ visited this part of Asia and ascended this summit, whence he looked down on all the region around. After blessing the country to the northward, he turned towards the south, and looking across the Baikal, he waved his hand, exclaiming 'Beyond this there is nothing.'" Thus they account for the sterility of [[Daouria]], where it is said "no corn will grow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=c3EEAAAAYAAJ&amp;vq=christ&amp;pg=PA385 |title=Travels in the Regions of the Upper and Lower Amoor |page=385 |author=T. W. Atkinson |year=1861 |publisher=Hurst and Blackett}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lake Baikal has been celebrated in several Russian folk songs. Two of these songs are well known in Russia and its neighboring countries, such as Japan.

*"[[Glorious Sea, Sacred Baikal]]" (in {{Lang-ru|Славное Mope, Священный Байкал}}) is about a ''[[katorga]]'' fugitive. The lyrics as documented and edited in the 19th century by Dmitriy P. Davydov (1811–1888).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karaoke.ru/song/3422.htm |title=The Glorious Sea, Sacred Baikal |publisher=Karaoke.ru |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; See "Barguzin River" for sample lyrics.
*"[[Po dikim stepyam Zabaikalya|The Wanderer]]" (in {{Lang-ru|Бродяга}}) is about a convict who had escaped from jail and was attempting to return home from [[Transbaikal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karaoke.ru/song/692.htm «По диким степям Забайкалья», Русланова Лидия]. karaoke.ru  {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics were collected and edited in the 20th century by [[Ivan Kondratyev]].

The latter song was a secondary [[theme song]] for the [[Soviet Union]]'s second color film, ''[[Ballad of Siberia]]'' (1947; in {{Lang-ru|Сказание о земле Сибирской}}).

Lapan-TUB Sat was launched on a [[PSLV|PSLV launcher]] on 1 January 2007 from the [[India]]n space centre in [[Sriharikota]] and still functioning well after the fifth birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediaindonesia.com/read/2012/02/02/295809/291/7/Lapan-Kembangkan-Satelit-Observasi-Bumi |title=Lapan Kembangkan Satelit Observasi Bumi |accessdate=February 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205132206/http://www.mediaindonesia.com/read/2012/02/02/295809/291/7/Lapan-Kembangkan-Satelit-Observasi-Bumi |archivedate=February 5, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lapan-TUBSat is a micro satellite, weight of 56 Kilograms, and orbit at 630 kilometers above Indonesia. This satellite [[pass (spaceflight)|pass]]es the polar orbital (from one polar to another) and across the archipelago for two or three times each day. Image of Lapan- TUBsat, now can only be received by Lapan ground station in Rumpin, West Java, called remote sensing image for West Indonesia. Afterward, ground station in Pare Pare, South Celebes and Biak Island, Papua, will be built to receive image from remote sensing satellite for Middle and East Indonesia.

Before this discovery, image input and satellite data for the observation need, are received from other countries’ natural resources satellites, such as Landsat and NOAA (United States), SPOT (France), Radarsat (Canada), JRS (Japan), and also Feng Yun (China). Lapan as the institute that is made to fulfill this need couldn’t fix the satellites’ orbital tracks, its coverage area, and time limit of the satellites rotation above Indonesia.

Now, the Lapan-TUBsat can relay topography images from several regions in Indonesia. At the test phase, the satellite was aimed to Strait of Madura, North Java, Bangka Maritime and Strait of Malaya. Those areas classified as catastrophes areas of accident and flood. This point is consistent with the Lapan-TUBsat mission, giving attention to potentially dangerous areas in Indonesia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="88740">This is a '''list of wars involving the United Kingdom''' and its predecessor states (such as the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], and generally the [[British Isles]]). Notable [[militarized interstate dispute]]s are included. 

Historically, the UK relied most heavily on the [[Royal Navy]] and maintained relatively small land forces. Most of the episodes listed here deal with insurgencies and revolts in the various colonies of the [[British Empire]].

During its history, the UK's forces (or forces with a British mandate) have invaded, had some control over or fought conflicts in 171 of the world's 193 countries that are currently UN member states, or nine out of ten of all countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Laycock, S. |title=All the Countries We've Ever Invaded – And the Few We Never Got Round To |publisher=The History Press |date=2012|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/books/dp/0752479695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] public discourse the territory traditionally inhabited by the [[Basques]] was assigned a variety of names across the centuries. Terms used might have been almost identical, with hardly noticeable difference in content and connotation, or they could have varied enormously, also when consciously used one against another. The names used demonstrate changing perceptions of the area and until today the nomenclature employed could be battleground between partisans of different options.&lt;ref&gt;"In all of Spain, the Basque country, or Euskadi, is without doubt the place, the social space, the political territory and the cultural community that most commands attention in conversations of place and space. It is a space and a place under intense contestation, construction, erasure, deconstruction and sometimes, indeed, destruction. The struggle over Basque geography is both internal and external. It begins with its very nomenclature. Is the historical homeland of the Basque people Euskadi, Euskal Herria, Vasconia, the Vascongadas, Pais Vasco-Navarro, or plain Pais Vasco?", Nathan E. Richardson, ''Constructing Spain: The Re-imagination of Space and Place in Fiction and Film, 1953–2003'', Plymouth 2012, {{ISBN|9781611483963}}, pp. 261-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of names used==

The below list contains names applied in Spanish cultural realm to the territory traditionally inhabited by the Basques. Terms originating from other languages (first of all [[Basque language|Basque]], though also [[Latin language|Latin]]) are acknowledged if in circulation also in Spanish. The list contains indisputably [[proper names]] (e.g. "Provincias Vascongadas"), names with unclear or varying usage (e.g. "Provincias Exentas" or "provincias exentas") and names which have never acquired the status of a proper name, though they might have been intended to (e.g. "provincias hermanas"). Names differing only in terms of [[orthography]] are grouped under one heading. Non-Spanish names which barely made it to the Spanish cultural discourse (e.g. "Hirurak bat", "Zazpiak Bat", [[:es:Gascuña|"Gascuña"]]) are not listed.

===Cantabria===

A term sometimes used in official and semi-official prints until the mid-19th century, usually referring to the Basque lands without Navarre and specifically [[Álava]], [[Biscay]] and [[Gipuzkoa]]&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in the 1713 document named ''Real Congregación de Naturales y Originarios de las Tres Provincias Vascongadas'', named also the Jurisdiction of Cantabria for fiscal purposes.&lt;/ref&gt; or to Álava, Biscay, Gipuzkoa and [[Navarre]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in the Real Decreto of 1847, see Juan Carlos Molero, ''Public Spending and Fiscal Federalism in Spain. Period 1984–1998'', [in:] ''Munich Personal RePEc Archive 2008'', pp. 42-3, available [https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/8098/1/MPRA_paper_8098.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; The name contained no [[Ethnicity|ethnic]] or cultural flavor related to the Basque realm.{{Clarify|date=January 2018}} It started to get out of circulation when applied to Basque territories in the early 19th century, with increasing usage focused on [[Santander, Spain|Santander]] and the adjacent area; the [[:es:Provincia de Santander (España)|Santander province created in 1833]] was originally to be named Cantabria. In public usage the term was already firmly related to Santander when the Basque nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th century. Today "Cantabria" is official name of the [[Cantabria (province)|autonomous community centered upon Santander]]; also in unofficial circulation the term is used likewise, with application to Álava, Biscay, Gipuzkoa and/or Navarre only in historical discourse.&lt;ref&gt;the name "Cantabria" sounded as a distant echo of the original term into the late 20th century. Writing in the 1970s, Francisco Letamendía distinguished between two parts of Euskadi: the Cantabrian one (i.e. in the Atlantic drainage basin) and the Mediterranean one, compare Ortzi [Francisco Letamendía ], ''Los Vascos. Ayer, hoy y mañana'', Hendaye 1976, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euskalerría===

also '''Euskal-Erria, Euskal Erria, Euskal-Herria, Euskal Herria, Euskeria''', always capitalized. In Basque literally ''Basque realm''. The term traditionally in use in different Basque spoken dialects, it was first used in writing (in alavese Basque dialect) in the 16th century and enjoyed renaissance with growing number of Basque prints since the 1880s, filtering into Spanish and used usually as [[Macaronic language|macaronic intercalation]]. Originally it could have referred to a territory, a population, a cultural commonality or all these components together. Most commonly it simply denoted a Basque realm, understood as a conglomerate of historical, regional, ethnic, cultural and religious ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;Javier Corcuera Atienza, ''La patria de los vascos: orígenes, ideología y organización del nacionalismo vasco, 1876–1903'', Michigan 2001, {{ISBN|9788430604456}}, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; Originally it was entirely deprived of political flavor; in the late 19th century it was briefly adopted by emerging [[Basque nationalism|Basque nationalists]] (to denote a Basque land),&lt;ref&gt;though never without controversy. Key advocate of “Euskalerria” was Campión, Javier Fernández Sebastián, Juan Francisco Fuentes Aragonés (eds.), ''Diccionario político y social del siglo XX español'', Madrid 2008, {{ISBN|9788420687698}}, p. 868&lt;/ref&gt; who later abandoned it for the sake of “Euzkadi”. In the early 20th century “Euskalerria” adopted a conservative political taste (with some tension between “Euskalerria” and “Euzkadi”),&lt;ref&gt;the tension still persists, see the 2008 football incident [http://gara.naiz.eus/paperezkoa/20081114/106483/es/Los-futbolistas-niegan-jugar-bajo-otra-denominacion-que-no-sea-Euskal-Herria here]&lt;/ref&gt; entirely lost during Francoism. In the later 20th century the term was re-adopted by the nationalists;&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Sebastián, Fuentes Aragonés 2008, p. 868&lt;/ref&gt; since 1979 “Euskal Herria” is one of two official Basque names of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|automous community consisting of Biscay, Gipuzkoa and Álava]].&lt;ref&gt;for the official text of the Basque version see [http://www.congreso.es/constitucion/ficheros/estatutos/e_76_eusk.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; Geographical application was and is (except official use) ambiguous depending on perceived territorial coverage of the Basque realm; it could include [[Labourd]], [[Lower Navarre]] and [[Soule]] or even territories in [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseba Agirreazkuenaga, ''Euskal Herria en el tiempo'', [in:] ''Euskal Herria'' 50 (2011), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euzkadi===

also '''Euskadi''', always capitalized. In current Basque ''Basque land'', originally meaning ''Basque-race land''. The term was created as “Euzkadi” by [[Sabino Arana]] in the late 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;first used in writing in 1897&lt;/ref&gt; who felt that “Euskalerria”, “Vascongadas”, “Vasconia” or other terms did not properly reflect the idea of separate Basque race identity&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Sebastián, Fuentes Aragonés 2008, p. 867&lt;/ref&gt; and the ensuing distinctive character of the territory the Basques inhabited.&lt;ref&gt;Corcuera 2001, pp. 382-3&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century the term filtered into Spanish, though used sparsely, usually as macaronic intercalation, and never [[Lexicalization|lexicalized]]; its precedent terms, briefly considered in Basque, "Euzkadia" and "Euskaria" have never entered wider circulation.&lt;ref&gt;compare e.g. one of the first lectures of Basque nationalism, ''Euskaria para los euskaros'' by Pedro Merladet Lazgoitia, written in 1894&lt;/ref&gt; From the onset the term was (intentionally) politically charged, as it served nationalist Basque purposes; it was opposed or ignored by those who preferred to confront Basque political ambitions. “Euzkadi” was the official Basque name of [[:es:Estatuto de Autonomía del País Vasco de 1936|autonomous territory created in 1936]];&lt;ref&gt;see the official text, available [http://www.ivap.euskadi.eus/r61-3039/eu/contenidos/informacion/legedia_euskaraz/eu_3818/adjuntos/Testu_Historikoak/EUZKADIREN_BERJABETASUN-ARAUDIA_1936.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; “Euskadi” (note different spelling) is currently one of two official Basque names of the autonomous community consisting of Álava, Biscay and Gipuzkoa.&lt;ref&gt;for official text of the Basque-language document see [http://www.congreso.es/constitucion/ficheros/estatutos/e_76_eusk.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the term was applied to all territories perceived as forming part of the Basque realm and is still used this way by some nationalist groupings. Seldom used in present-day Spanish, usually as official Basque equivalent of “País Vasco”.

===país eúskaro===

also '''Pais Eúskaro'''. In Spanish literally ''Euskera-speaking country''. The term was in circulation in the late 19th and the early 20th century, though used very sporadically and almost exclusively against a cultural and literary background.&lt;ref&gt;compare ''La Epoca'' 12.03.59, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000251112&amp;page=4&amp;search=pa%C3%ADs+e%C3%BAskaro&amp;lang=es here] or ''Revista de archivos, bibliotecas y museos'' 01.02.97, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000018172&amp;page=40&amp;search=pa%C3%ADs+e%C3%BAskaro&amp;lang=es here], or s&lt;/ref&gt; The term strongly focused not only on Basque language, but also on the entire cultural and ethnic realm built around it.&lt;ref&gt;Coro Rubio Pobes, ''La identidad vasca en el siglo XIX: discurso y agentes sociales'', Madrid 2003, {{ISBN|9788497421195}}, pp. 41-3&lt;/ref&gt; It was used principally by partisans of the Basque identity, usually understood in cultural and linguistic terms (though also in national terms). Geographical application was ambiguous; prevailing usage ignored existing administrative divisions and pointed to area inhabited by people belonging to the Basque cultural realm. In many respects the term was identical to “Euskalerria”, though “país eúskaro” (except having been a [[neologism]]) emphasized language and cultural dimension, while “Euskalerria” maintained balance between linguistic-ethnic threads and historical-religious threads. Today entirely out of use.

===país vasco===

also '''País Vasco, país basco'''. In Spanish literally ''Basque country''. The term was in circulation in writing as early as in the 15th century, though until the 20th century used rather sporadically. Similar in meaning and geographical application to “provincias vascas”, i.e. could have been applied to 3, 4 or 7 units in Spain and France; the difference was that it underlined unity of the area and did not put its internal administrative heterogeneity on the forefront.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio Pobes 2003, pp. 41-3&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between “país vasco” and “país vascongado” was that the former put slightly more emphasis on the Basque character, while the latter tended to be more lexicalized. In the 1920s the term overtook “Provincias Vascongadas” in terms of popular press usage.&lt;ref&gt;in the popular Madrid daily ''ABC'' the usage ratio between “País Vasco” and “Provincias Vascongadas” was 1:1.4 in the 1910s (67 vs 94), 1.4:1 in the 1920s (295 vs 211) and 2.8:1 in the 1930s (until July 1, 1936, 635 vs 226), compare http://hemeroteca.abc.es/avanzada.stm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 adopted (with both words capitalized as “País Vasco”) as official Spanish name of the autonomous Basque area within the Second Spanish Republic,&lt;ref&gt;for the original text, see [https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Estatuto_de_Autonom%C3%ADa_del_Pa%C3%ADs_Vasco_de_1936 here]&lt;/ref&gt; today it remains official name of the autonomous community consisting of Álava, Biscay and Gipuzkoa provinces.&lt;ref&gt;for the official text, see [https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Estatuto_de_Autonom%C3%ADa_del_Pa%C3%ADs_Vasco_de_1979 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In present-day nationalist discourse it could be applied (capitalized or not) to any area deemed part of the proper Basque country.

===país vasco-navarro===

also '''país vasconavarro, País Vasconavarro, país basko-navarro'''. In Spanish literally ''Basque-Navarrese country''. Never appearing as “país navarro-vasco”. The term was in public circulation since the early 19th century but unlike other descriptions using the “vasco-navarro” adjective (“pueblo vasco-navarro”, “ejercito vasco-navarro” etc. ) it was used rather sporadically.&lt;ref&gt;for a sample see e.g. ''La Esperanza'' 01.09.1845, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001813189&amp;page=1&amp;search=pais+vasconavarro&amp;lang=es here]&lt;/ref&gt;  Applied to Biscay, Gipuzkoa, Álava and Navarre when intending to underline any sort of commonality (historical, economic, geographical etc., though rather not ethnic) linking the four. Upon growth of the Basque nationalism it got used against the background of differences between Navarre on the one hand and Álava, Biscay and Gipuzkoa on the other, though with various intentions (to stress or to downplay them). Its confusing political usage led to de-emphasizing of political contents. Today generally out of use, except for historical or specific cultural discourse.

===país vascongado===

In Spanish literally ''Basque-speaking country''. The term entered circulation in the second half of the 19th century; it was used rather sporadically until the Civil War. Almost abandoned during [[Francoism]], following [[Spanish transition to democracy]] it is hardly in use.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' usage of the term by decade is 2 (1890s), 7 (1900s), 12 (1910s), 10 (1920s), 22 (1930s), 0 (1940s), 6 (1950s), 4 (1960s), 9 (1970s), 2 (1980s), 1 (1990s) and 0 (2000s)&lt;/ref&gt; Similar in geographical application to “provincias vascongadas”, i.e. applied to Álava, Biscay and Gipuzkoa. There were two key differences between “país vascongado” and “provincias vascongadas”: 1) the former was not the official name of the [[:es:División territorial de España en 1833|region]] (though at times used in the interchanging mode), and 2) the former underlined unity of the area and did not put its internal administrative heterogeneity on the forefront.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio Pobes 2003, pp.41-3&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between “país vascongado” and “país vasco” (in its 19th-century usage) was tiny; the former was more lexicalized, the latter put more emphasis on Basque (historical, cultural, ethnic) character.

===provincias eúskaras===

also '''provincias Eúskaras, Provincias eúskaras'''. In Spanish literally ''Euskara-speaking provinces''. The term entered circulation in the mid-19th century; used sporadically, it disappeared in the very early 20th century. It emphasized Basque character somewhat stronger than “provincias vascas” and far stronger than “provincias vascongadas”, though still fell short of acknowledging Basque ethnicity as key feature of the area in question; at times it even pointed to patchy nature of the territory discussed.&lt;ref&gt;''Madrid Cientifico'' 508/12 (1908), available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001767196&amp;page=5 here]&lt;/ref&gt;  Contained no political contents or undertones. The nascent Basque nationalism did not use the name. Geographically applied to Álava, Biscay and Gipuzkoa. Today entirely out of use.

===provincias exentas===

also '''Provincias exentas, Provincias Exentas'''. In Spanish literally ''exempted provinces''. The term entered circulation in the mid-18th century and was gradually getting out of use in the second half of the 19th century; in the early 20th century it was already entirely defunct. The name underlined that among all Spanish provinces, the ones in question were exempted from standard fiscal and conscription obligations. The term was seldom used to denote homogeneous character of the provinces; it did not underline their commonality, but rather the character making each of them distinct from the remaining Spanish provinces. It contained no ethnic ingredient whatsoever, the regional one was present though rather muted.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio Pobes 2003, pp. 37-38&lt;/ref&gt; Geographical usage of the term differed; generally it was applied to Álava, Biscay and Gipuzkoa, though sporadically (especially in the early 19th century) it could have denoted also Navarre.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. José Canga Argüelles, ''Diccionario de Hacienda'', vol. 2, Madrid 1834, p. 461-464 claimed that "este nombre llevan las de Navarra, Vizcaya, Álava y Guipúzcoa", compare [https://books.google.de/books?id=C9rHUP4vnRAC&amp;pg=PA461#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false here]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently not only out of use but also almost entirely forgotten term.

===provincias forales===

In Spanish literally ''[[Fuero|foral]] provinces''. The term is in circulation since the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;compare ''La Epoca'' 09.03.1884, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000444066&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; though used rather sparsely. The name underlines that provinces in question enjoy some traditional, separate, province-specific (not region-specific) legal establishments, known as fueros. In most cases usage and context imply detailed administrative coverage,&lt;ref&gt;compare ''ABC'' 29.12.16, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1916/12/29/011.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; which is by no means obvious; understanding might differ depending which provincial legal specifics is considered "fueros". In such cases in public discourse usually the term is applied to Álava, Biscay and Gipuzkoa,&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 04.09.05, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/cultural/2005/04/09/018.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; at times also explicitly.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. as "tres provincias forales", ''ABC'' 12.03.01, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/2001/03/12/042.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat less frequently the term is applied also to Navarre,&lt;ref&gt;for historic usage see Ramon Ortiz de Zarate, ''Biblioteca Vasco Navarra'', Pamplona 1870, pp. 134-135, for contemporary usage see ''ABC'' 16.02.02, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/2002/02/16/018.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; though this usage prevails in historiographic scholarly discourse.&lt;ref&gt;compare Victor Manuel Arbeloa, ''Navarra y los estatutos de autonomía'', Madrid 2015, {{ISBN|9788416549177}}, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; In specific cases - also usually in historiography - "provincias forales" could mean also provinces in [[Aragon]], [[Catalonia]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Henry Kamen, ''La Espanã de Carlos II'', Madrid 1981, {{ISBN|9788474231427}}, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

===provincias hermanas===

In Spanish literally ''sister provinces''. The term enjoyed some popularity at the turn of the 19th and 20th century, though still it was used rather sporadically and in specialized rather than popular discourse. It was unique among all terms discussed here, as it was the only one capturing both diversity (referring to different provinces) and commonality (acknowledging their sister character). It strongly underlined unity of the provinces referred to, usually against a cultural, historical, ethnic or national background.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio Pobes 2003, p. 41, for example compare ''ABC'' 27.07.05, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1905/07/27/011.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Very much like “provincias vascongadas” and even “provincias eúskaras”, the term was not necessarily employed by partisans of the commonality discussed (in ethnic or national sense), and could have been employed in quite informal mode.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 08.06.99, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1909/06/08/006.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Geographically the term was applied usually towards Álava, Biscay and Gipuzkoa. "Provincias hermanas" could have been also applied to any chosen Spanish provinces deemed similar&lt;ref&gt;e.g. the provinces of Huesca and Teruel, compare ''ABC'' 16.09.08, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1908/09/16/008.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; or even generally, to all Spanish provinces.&lt;ref&gt;compare ''ABC'' 14.04.04, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1904/04/14/001.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Today out of use and entirely forgotten.

===provincias vascas===

In Spanish literally ''Basque provinces''. The term entered circulation in the 19th century, though in terms of press usage until the Civil War it trailed far behind “provincias vascongadas” or “país vasco”.&lt;ref&gt;in ''ABC'' the usage ratio between “provincias vascas”  and “provincias vascongadas” was 1:4.7 in the 1910s, 1:3.2 in the 1920s and 1:2.2 in the 1930s (until July 1, 1936), compare search engine availeble [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/avanzada.stm here]&lt;/ref&gt; The term put slightly more emphasis on Basque character of the area than “provincias vascongadas” did.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio Pobes 2003, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Its usage by no means implied support for Basque cause either politically or otherwise (though it might have). Geographical application of the term was ambiguous. Most commonly it referred to Álava, Biscay and Gipuzkoa, though it might have referred also to Navarre&lt;ref&gt;apart from nationalist discourse at times also in scholarly works, compare Santiago de Pablo Contreras, ''El Estatuto vasco y la cuestión foral en Navarra durante la II República'', [in:] ''Gerónimo de Uztariz'' 2 (1988), pp. 42-48&lt;/ref&gt; and (rarely) even to 3 French provinces;&lt;ref&gt;Rubio Pobes 2003, pp. 45-6&lt;/ref&gt; in such cases it usually focused on ethnic question. Today it is used sometimes (rather occasionally) to denote Álava, Biscay and Gipuzkoa. It was not capitalized (usage of “Provincias Vascas” is rather exceptional).

===provincias vascongadas===

also '''Provincias Vascongadas, provincias Vascongadas, provincias bascongadas, provincias Bascongadas, Provincias Bascongadas, provincias baskongadas'''. In Spanish literally ''Basque-speaking provinces''. The term entered circulation in the 17th century&lt;ref&gt;first noted in the 1624 work of Juan de Grijalva, ''Cróníca de la Orden de n. p. s. Agustín en las provincias de la Nueva España''&lt;/ref&gt; and remained in use until the first half of the 20th century, though since the late 19th century with decreasing unofficial usage. Until the 1930s it was the official administrative name of the region (in this usage capitalized).&lt;ref&gt;''Guía Oficial de España'' 1911, p. 611, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001038237&amp;page=599 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Until the early 20th century it was also the most common, rather neutral way of naming the area in question; in the 1920s it started to give precedence to “País Vasco”.&lt;ref&gt;in ''ABC'' the usage ratio between “País Vasco” and “Provincias Vascongadas” was 1:1.4 in the 1910s (67 vs 94), 1.4:1 in the 1920s (295 vs 211) and 2.8:1 in the 1930s (until July 1, 1936, 635 vs 226), compare [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/avanzada.stm here]&lt;/ref&gt; Though the name technically pointed to distinct linguistic character of the area, the component was later subject to lexicalization and ceased to stand out.&lt;ref&gt;compare definitions offered by ''Diccionario de la lengua castellana'', 3rd edition (Madrid 1781) and 6th edition (Madrid 1822)&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of the term did not imply the intention to underline a separate, Basque ethnic character of the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio Pobes 2003, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; The term was generally applied to Álava, Biscay and Gipuzkoa,&lt;ref&gt;compare e.g. ''Mercurio histórico y político'' May 1766, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0012194633&amp;page=76 here] or ''El Sol'' 01.04.20, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000232461&amp;page=5 here]&lt;/ref&gt; exceptionally also to Navarre.&lt;ref&gt;see José Canga Argüelles, ''Diccionario de Hacienda'', Madrid 1834, pp. 461-464&lt;/ref&gt; Today almost entirely out of circulation, used very sporadically and generally against a historical background.&lt;ref&gt;compare ''ABC'' 26.01.14, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/2014/01/26/020.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vascongadas===

also '''Bascongadas, bascongadas, Baskongadas''', in Spanish literally ''Basque-speaking [provinces, territory, area, country]''. Developed as an abbreviated form of “Provincias Vascongadas”, and not seldom used in official documents until the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;''Guía oficial de España'' 1922, p. 847, available  [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001038237&amp;page=847 here]
&lt;/ref&gt; In unofficial circulation “Vascongadas” along “Provincias Vascongadas” was the most common denomination until the late [[Restoration (Spain)|Restoration]] period, but gave way to “País Vasco” in the 1920s-1930s.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in 1934 the ''ABC'' ratio between editorial usage (i.e. except commercials, official names etc.) of “Vascongadas” and “País Vasco” was ca 1:3, compare [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/avanzada.stm here]&lt;/ref&gt; Though technically it pointed to Basque character of the area in question, the feature was entirely lexicalized and did not stand out. Fairly neutral in usage, deprived of ethnic, let alone national notions. A rather slight difference between “Vascongadas” and “Provincias Vascongadas” was that the former name did not acknowledge provinces, either in terms of their heterogeneity or in terms of their forming part of Spanish administrative structure; however, this technical lexical difference has usually not been exploited for political reasons. Geographically the term was applied to Álava, Biscay and Gipuzkoa, though sporadically it could have included also Navarre.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Diccionario de Hacienda'' of Canga Argüelles (1834) claimed that "este nombre [Provincias Exentas] llevan las de Navarra, Vizcaya, Álava y Guipúzcoa, conocidas también con el de vascongadas"&lt;/ref&gt; The term was almost eradicated – at least in territorial application – during [[Francoism]].&lt;ref&gt;though it was seldom used, see ''ABC'' 29.06.58, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1958/06/29/043.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Except sporadic cases and rather accidental usage in official documents&lt;ref&gt;compare ''BOE'' 252 (2012), available [http://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2012-13026 here]; the usage appears to be actually an editorial negligence resulting form copy-pasting proper name of a company&lt;/ref&gt; it was not revived afterwards, as most common denomination replaced by “País Vasco”. Currently out of circulation, except in historical discourse or in personal columns, sometimes consciously used to note nominal controversies.&lt;ref&gt;compare ''ABC'' 29.01.14, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/2014/01/29/017.html here], or ''ABC'' 16.12.14, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/2014/12/16/003.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vasconia===

also '''vasconia, baskonia, Baskonia, Wasconia''', also plural '''Vasconiae, Vasconias''', and part of the etymology of ''[[Gascony]]''. In [[Latin language|Latin]] ''Basque Land''. The term emerged in Roman times and until medieval era it was occasionally used in Latin documents and maps, usually with ambiguous geographical rather than political denotation.&lt;ref&gt;Agirreazkuenaga 2011, 65-66, see also Koldo Larrañaga Elortza, ''De «wasco» a «Wasconia» y «Vascongadas». Disquisiciones sobre ciertos corrimientos onomásticos en la Alta Edad Media'', [in:] ''Entre Euskadi y Euskalherria, vicisitudes de un concepto'' (conference paper 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely used in Spanish;&lt;ref&gt;the Spanish national hemeroteca quotes only 15 cases of usage in the 1840s, 11 in the 1850s, 12 in the 1860s&lt;/ref&gt; when used in plural it referred to 2 parts (“ambas Vasconias”,&lt;ref&gt;''La Voz'' 20.08.24, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000798465&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; “dos Vasconias”&lt;ref&gt;''Revista de Archivos, Bibliotecas y Museos'' 1 (1897), p. 495, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000019631&amp;page=15 here]&lt;/ref&gt;): the Spanish and the French one. It enjoyed modest revival in the late 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;224 cases of usage in the 1870s, 68 in the 1880s, and 320 in the 1890s&lt;/ref&gt; used generally against a cultural, historical and regional background; it appeared mostly in literary or scientific Vascólogist discourse. The term underlined commonality of Basque area but was deprived of political notions; it tended to put common history on the forefront. It lacked clear geographical meaning and was applied according to perceived territorial coverage of the Basque realm. Following demise in the early 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in 1934 ''ABC'' used the term "Vasconia" around 10 times (except in official names or strictly historical usage), while “Pais Vasco” was used around 60 times&lt;/ref&gt; “Vasconia” enjoyed some revival during Francoism; unlike politically-charged “país vasco” or “provincias vascas”, censorship tolerated it easily as a historical, semi-scientific reference. Following brief confusion among the nationalists in the mid-1960s,&lt;ref&gt;mostly thanks to Federico Krutwig, who put forward his idea of armed violence against the Spanish state in a 1963 work titled “Vasconia”, Fernández Sebastián, Fuentes Aragonés 2008, p. 875&lt;/ref&gt; currently it is out of use except for historical discourse (or names of institutions, sporting associations etc.).

'''Nordvest''' ([[Literal translation|lit.]]: '''Northwest''', short form of '''[[Copenhagen]] North West''') or '''The North West Block''' is an area in [[Denmark]]'s [[Copenhagen Municipality|Copenhagen municipality.]] It is located in the southwestern part of the [[Bispebjerg]] district. Although there are no clear borders nor any official demarcation, it is broadly recognized as the area covered mostly by [[List of postal codes in Denmark|the Danish postal code]] ''2400 København NV'' (''NV'' being shorthand for ''Nordvest''),&lt;ref name="dr"&gt;Radio broadcast [http://www.dr.dk/P1/Serier/20110131114755.htm 2400 NV], sent 2011-01-31 20:03 on [[DR (broadcaster)|DR P1]] in Danish&lt;/ref&gt; although some areas lie outside this postal code. As of 2005, 44,177 people resided in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?Maintable=PNR1 | title=PNR1: Befolkningen efter område (postnumre) (AFSLUTTET) | publisher=[[Statistics Denmark]] | trans-title=Population by area (postal codes) (COMPLETED) | language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
A large area of the current Nordvest previously formed part of the Brønshøj-[[Rødovre Municipality|Rødovre]] municipality, which consisted mostly of low-density housing and small businesses.&lt;ref name="dr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lokh"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.agendaforening-nordvest.dk/tekster/Nr%202%20R4_%2009%2005%2021%20Kvartervand%20Rentemestervej%20An%E2%80%A6.pdf | title=Kvartervandring i Nordvestkvarteret] af Lokalhistorisk Arkiv Bispebjerg-Nordvest | language=Danish | trans-title=Area hike in ''Nordvest'' by the Bispebjerg-Nordvest local historic archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the Copenhagen municipality annexed the area from the Brønshøj-Rødovre municipality in order to construct a "socially democratic ideal where one can live from cradle to grave without moving more than a few blocks."&lt;ref name="dr" /&gt; Consequently, in the following years a large number of [[social housing]] units and [[homeless shelter]]s were constructed and soon populated by evicted residents from central Copenhagen (which was undergoing a housing "sanitization" during this time). Along with the construction of social housing, the area's readily available workforce also built small and large industrial complexes in the unused areas between the houses. This gave rise to the construction of different kinds of housing, such as the ''typografernes hus'' (lit.: ''[[typographer]]'s housing''), a type of housing in which residents live in the above-ground area and old, functional printing presses are housed in the basement.&lt;ref name="dr" /&gt;

Throughout the 1980s, the ''Nordvest'' was increasingly characterized as an area for apartments, which were relatively inexpensive compared to those in the surrounding areas of Copenhagen. In 1980, the area was designated by the community psychiatric authorities to house people with mental health diagnoses in the community. However, soon thereafter there was a spike in vandalism and assaults.&lt;ref name="dr" /&gt; In 1993, the Ministry of Housing, the [[Ministry of Social Affairs (Denmark)|Ministry of Social Affairs]], and the Copenhagen municipality agreed on a "holistic effort in the Nordvest" to improve the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kvarterloeft.dk/publikationer/rapporter/rapp_1.htm | title=Kvarterløft - Rumlig modernisering of social rummelighed, rapport af Axel R. Kristiansen og Jørgen Bang, Roskilde Universitets Center | dead-url=usurped | language=Danish | trans-title=Area improvements - open minded modernization and social tolerance, report by Axel R. Kristiansen and Jørgen Bangm, Roskilde University}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would later serve as a model and precursor for later area improvement projects elsewhere in Denmark.

By 2013, the area had experienced a partial urban regeneration, characterized by an ethnically diverse population and a wide range of small businesses, while the industrial complexes were largely renovated and converted to modern housing. A film on the subject was directed by Michael Noer.&lt;ref name="dr" /&gt;

== Characteristics and attractions ==
The area is bordered (from the north, clockwise) by the remaining part of [[Bispebjerg]], the districts [[Østerbro]] and [[Nørrebro]], the municipality of [[Frederiksberg]], and the districts [[Vanløse]] and [[Brønshøj-Husum]]. The major roads Tagensvej, Frederiksborgvej, Tuborgvej/Tomsgårdsvej/Hjulgårdsvej, Borups Allé, and Hillerødgade all cut through ''Nordvest''.

Two large green areas can be found in the area: [[Utterslev Mose]] is the northwest border of the area, and the ''Bispebjerg Kirkegård'' cemetery is near the center. Smaller green areas include the ''Emaljehaven'' (lit.: the Enamel Garden), a renovated green area that previously housed a large metal workshop,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkark.dk/building.aspx?buildingid=13067|title= Arkark.dk: Emaljehaven}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rødkilde park'' (lit.: The Red Source park), which hosts the Rødkilde Nature Playground&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gogreencopenhagen.dk/gogreencopenhagen/steder/opleve/det-er-for-boern/naturlegepladsen-i-roedkildeparken/?lang=en |title=Go Green Copenhagen: Rødkilde Nature Playground}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Nordvestparken'' (lit.: the North West park), constructed in 2009, which won the Danish Light Award in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lemming-eriksson.dk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=138&amp;Itemid=187 |title=Lemming-Eriksson: Nordvestparken| language=Danish|trans-title=Lemming-Eriksson: The North West park}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earlier social housing and industrial buildings have undergone a transformation: while many of the old buildings are still standing, they have been repurposed. Most of the old buildings have not been modernized, and only some have been partially modernized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://2400nv.com/#/nordvest/ | title=2400 NV: Lyt til stedets stemmer | language=Danish | trans-title=2400 NV: Listen to the areas voices}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the relocation of much of the industry to less populated areas, the old industrial complexes provide an opportunity for modern housing and activities. One such example of the modernization of the old ''[[Ungdomshuset]]'' area was the creation of a large cultural creativity space, ''Boljefabrikken'' (lit. the candy factory), housed in an old smithy and plumbing factory. The area's rugged image persists, and because of this it has acquired the nicknames ''Nordværst'' (''North Worst'') and ''Nordlædervest'' (''North Leather Vest'').&lt;ref name="guld"&gt;{{cite web | first1=Per | last1=Theimann | url=http://politiken.dk/tjek/penge/dinepenge/ECE1962638/det-rette-postnummer-er-guld-vaerd | title=Det rette postnummer er guld værd | publisher=[[Politiken]] | date=2013-05-04 | language=Danish | trans-title=The right postal code is worth a lot}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, housing costs are comparatively lower than other areas of Copenhagen; in the neighboring district of Østerbro and the neighboring municipality of Frederiksberg, housing prices are on average 50% higher than in Nordvest.&lt;ref name="guld" /&gt; Crime rates, however, are the same as in most of urban Copenhagen.&lt;ref name="guld" /&gt;

Even though the area is formally a part of the district ''Bispebjerg'', the ''Nordvest'' is often associated with the district [[Nørrebro]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://subsite.kk.dk/eDoc/%C3%98konomiudvalget/16-01-2001%2015.00/Dagsorden/23-05-2003%2013.59.24/9311EB5389045857C1256D2F0041DCF5.htm | title=Dagsorden for ordinært mode tirsdag den 16. januar 2001 i Københavns kommunes økonomiudvalg | trans-title=Agenda for ordinary meeting in Copenhagen municipality's fiscal board on 2001-01-16 | language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.folkesundhed.kk.dk/TilKoebenhavnere/MotionOgKost/Motionslisten/N%C3%B8rrebro%20og%20Nordvest.aspx | title=Folkesundhed i Norrebro og Nordvest | language=Danish | trans-title=Public health in Norrebro and Nordvest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://subsite.kk.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/Forebyggelsescentrene/SubsiteFrontpage/Motion/Motionslisten/Norrebro.aspx | title=Forebyggelsescentrene Nørrebro-Nordvest | trans-title=Prevention centres in Nørrebro and Nordvest | language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Copenhagen municipality is actively creating a more pervasive integration of ''Nordvest'' and Nørrebro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://subsite.kk.dk/~/media/63D4D69CE9EB419F876F7A89B774A5B4.ashx | title=Udviklingsplan Nørrebro (TMF 129) af Københavns Kommune | trans-title=Development plan for Norrebro (TMF 129) by Copenhagen municipality | language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Okapi Conservation Project''' ('''OCP''') was founded in 1987 for the protection of the [[okapi]]s (''Okapia johnstoni'') and their [[habitat]]. [[Okapi]]s are only found in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]&lt;ref name="wcn"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://wildlifeconservationnetwork.org/wildlife/okapi2.html#conservationist
 |title = Okapi Conservation Project

 |url = http://www.africanconservation.org/content/view/79/409/ |title = Okapi Conservation Project 
 |publisher = African Conservation Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OCP has about one hundred staff members and one hundred and ten government rangers under the direction of the Institute in Congo for the Conservation of Nature. The Okapi Conservation Project is partnered with the [[Wildlife Conservation Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://wildlifeconservationnetwork.org/wildlife/okapi.html |title = Okapi Conservation Project |publisher = [[Wildlife Conservation Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; OCP's founder John Lukas is also a founding member of the Wildlife Conservation Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://wildlifeconservationnetwork.org/about/team2.html#board |title =WCN Board of Directors |publisher = [[Wildlife Conservation Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 the project helped create the [[Okapi Wildlife Reserve]], encompassing 13,700 square kilometers of the [[Ituri Forest]], which was designated as a [[United Nations]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="wcn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/718 |author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |date=1992–2017  |title=Okapi Wildlife Reserve |access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 attack==
In June 2012 the headquarters for the Okapi Wildlife Reserve was taken over by poachers, intent on retaliating against the staff who had been stopping their elephant poaching and mining operations. Six guards and other staff as well as 14 [[okapi]]s were killed in the incident. The local village was looted, women were raped and the conservation center was burned down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher = Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

===Okapi Wildlife Reserve===
The [[Okapi Wildlife Reserve]] – an area 13,700 square kilometers, about one-fifth of the [[Ituri Forest]] – was created with the help of the Okapi Wildlife Project in 1992. The project continues to support the reserve by training and equipping wildlife guards and by providing assistance to improve the lives of neighboring communities.&lt;ref name="wcn"/&gt; The Okapi Wildlife Reserve was added to the list of [[World Heritage Site]]s in 1996, and since 1997 it has been listed as a World Heritage Site in danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://www.marketwatch.com/story/poachers-attack-okapi-wildlife-reserve-2012-06-25 |title = Poachers Attack Okapi Wildlife Reserve |publisher = Wall Street Journal Market Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agro-forestry===
The program provides farmers with resources to make their farmland more productive, thus decreasing farmers' need for forest land.&lt;ref name="wcn"/&gt; The program also works to reforest unused areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://houstonzooblogs.org/wildconservation/2010/05/the-okapi-conservation-project/ 
 |title = The Okapi Conservation Project 
 |publisher = [[Houston Zoo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation education and community assistance===
OCP offers an education team that travels throughout the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, providing workshops, lectures, and presentations on the importance of biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of forest resources. The team also distributes education materials to all of the twenty-three schools in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve. They also assist in school construction.&lt;ref name="wcn"/&gt;

===Other projects===
Other projects include finding alternatives to hunting [[bush meat]], such as raising [[tilapia]] and [[cane rat]]s. Another activity is providing air surveillance and wildlife guard response to stop illegal activities in the reserve.&lt;ref name="wcn"/&gt;

[[File:Dachzone Westliche Zinne.jpg|thumb|The large roof of the [[Western Zinne]] forms an overhang of 40 metres]]

An '''overhang''' is a [[rock face]] or artificial [[climbing wall]] with a slope of more than 90°, i.e. it slopes beyond the [[Vertical direction|vertical]]. Particularly severe overhangs that reach, or nearly reach, the [[horizontal plane|horizontal]], are referred to as a '''roof'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Gabi Flecken|Title=Klettern in der Halle |Publisher=Meyer &amp; Meyer|Year=2008|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;120|ISBN=9783898992961|Date=  2008|language=German|URL=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rvm7IFJx5_0C&amp;pg=PT120&amp;dq=|Format= Google Books|AccessDate=20 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[climbing]], overhangs and especially roofs place special demands both in terms of technique and equipment as well as the constitution of the sportsman or sportswoman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kletter-bergsport.de/html/lexikon-klettern.html |title=Kletter - Lexikon |access-date=20 September 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; With increasing steepness the loading on arm and hand muscles increases, because the feet can support less and less of the body weight. Rest points where the muscles can be relaxed, especially [[no-hands rest]]s, are rarely found in overhangs. Climbing techniques to tackle overhangs include placing the [[Center of mass|body's centre of mass]] as close as possible to the rock and striving for the highest possible body tension (German: ''Körperspannung'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Udo Neumann|Title=Lizenz zum Klettern 2.0 |Publisher=Udini Verlag|PublicationPlace=Köln|Year=2001|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;36|ISBN=3-9804809-0-9|Date=  2001|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.t5e.de/Workshops/Klettertechnik/Klettertechnik02.php |title=Klettertechnik - Überhänge |access-date=20 September 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Many climbing techniques such as the [[foothook]] are almost exclusively used in overhangs and roofs.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation/core|Surname1=Marietta Uhden|Periodical=[[Climb!]]|Title=Mit Schwung |Volume=6|Issue=08|Year=2008|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;58|Date=  2008|language=German|URL=http://www.climb.de/_downloads/zeitschriftenartikel/cl_akt_dow_0608_technik.pdf|AccessDate=20 September 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time in [[Alpine climbing]], roofs were almost always tacked using [[aid climbing|climbing aids]]. By contrast, in modern [[sport climbing]], severely overhanging terrain is no longer a rarity, because [[indoor climbing|climbing halls]] frequently include overhangs and roofs.

A well-known natural example of severely overhanging terrain is the rook in the north face of the [[Drei Zinnen|Western Zinne]], whose upper end is about 40 metres horizontally from the foot of the rock face. Severe [[climbing route]]s that feature overhangs and roofs include [[Separate Reality (climbing route)|Separate Reality]] in the USA and [[La Rambla (climb)|La Rambla]] in Spain.

==History==
In 1354, when Dejan had finished building the [[Arhiljevica]] Church of the Holy Mother of God, his [[Endowment (philosophy)|endowment]], he asked that some of the villages under his administration be granted to the church (as ''[[metochion]]'').&lt;ref name=Blagojevic-2007-448&gt;{{harvnb|Blagojević|2007|pp=448–449}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stefan Dušan's [[charter]] to Arhiljevica dated 10 August 1354,&lt;ref name=Blagojevic-2007-448/&gt; ''sevastokrator'' Dejan, whom he called his ''brother'' ("брат царства ми севастократор Дејан"),&lt;ref name=Mandic-161&gt;{{harvnb|Mandić|1986|p=161}} {{quote|У повељи манастиру Архиљевици, издатој ав- густа 1355. године, Душан на три места каже: „Брат царства ми севастократор Дејан".

It included the old ''[[župe]]'' (counties) of [[Žegligovo (župa)|Žegligovo]] and [[Preševo (župa)|Preševo]] (modern [[Kumanovo]] region with Sredorek, [[Kozjačija]] and the larger part of [[Pčinja District|Pčinja]]).&lt;ref name=IdNRS1951-20&gt;{{harvnb|Istorisko Društvo NR Srbije|1951|pp=20–21}} {{quote|према повељи манастиру богоро- дичимог ваведења у Архиљевици,50 држао као своју баштину пространу област иеточно од Скопске Црне Горе.

'''Telephone numbers in [[Azerbaijan]]''' follow the [[ITU-T|ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector]] [[E.164]] recommended format its [[telephone numbering plan]].

A caller from outside Azerbaijan would dial the international access number ([[international call prefix]]) of the originating country (00 for many countries, 011 from [[NANP]] areas), then dial the [[country code]] (in this case 994), omit the trunk prefix, then dial the two-digit area code, and then the seven-digit local number. 

For example, to reach the US embassy in [[Baku]], Azerbaijan, a caller in the United States would dial 011 994 12 4980335, while a caller in the UK would dial 00 994 12 4980335. (The area code for Baku is 12.)

For calls within Azerbaijan but outside the caller's area code, the caller would not dial an international access number or country code, but dial the trunk prefix (in this case 8) then the area code, followed by the telephone number. So, for instance, to call the American embassy in Baku from [[Ganja, Azerbaijan]], a caller would dial 8 12 4980335.

For a local call (that is, a call in Azerbaijan within the caller's area code) one simply dials the local number: 4980335.

==Area codes in Azerbaijan==
On August 1, 2011, Azerbaijan reorganized its national numbering plan for area codes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/02/02/T020200000F0001PDFE.pdf "ITU Operational Bulletin No.986"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221205951/http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/02/02/T020200000F0001PDFE.pdf |date=2016-02-21 }}, [[International Telecommunication Union]], Aug. 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the area codes of Baku, [[Sumqayit]], and the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]] (area codes 12, 18 and 36) remain unchanged.

Geographic numbers are nine digits long, including the area code, but not including the leading zero. Consequently, densely populated areas have shorter area codes, while less populated areas have longer area codes. For example:

* '''6''' xxxx xxxx (Osaka)
* '''75''' xxx xxxx (Kyoto)
* '''74-2''' xx xxxx (Nara)
* '''49-92''' x xxxx (Niijima island, Tokyo pref.)
* '''82-486'''  xxxx (Takano, Hiroshima pref.)

Area codes increase from north to south; [[Sapporo, Hokkaidō|Sapporo]] in [[Hokkaidō]] (the northernmost prefecture) has '''11''', and [[Setouchi, Kagoshima|Setouchi]]'s '''99-73''' is far to the south in Kagoshima.  When the telephone system was devised, Okinawa was still under [[Occupied Japan|U.S. occupation]], so when it was returned to Japan in 1972, its telephone numbers were squeezed between Miyazaki (98x) and Kagoshima (99x) and begin with 988, 989, and 980.

During the 1990s, when plans were being drawn up to amalgamate mid-sized cities and towns into larger municipalities, telephone numbering systems were merged in advance.  For example,

*'''7442''' x xxxx Kashihara (Nara prefecture)
*'''7444''' x xxxx Sakurai
*'''74452''' xxxx Takatori
*'''74454''' xxxx Asuka etc.

became:

* '''744''' 2x xxxx Kashihara
* '''744''' 4x xxxx Sakurai
* '''744''' 52 xxxx Takatori
* '''744''' 54 xxxx Asuka etc.

Many of these towns have in fact refused to merge, leaving callers with more digits to dial when making local calls.  This is partially balanced by not having to dial an area code for the neighboring city.

==Area code as local brand naming==

After entering the 2010s, local products and events have begun using names which come from the area code.

[[File:Map prevailing winds on earth.png|right|thumb|300px|The [[westerlies]] (blue arrows) and trade winds (yellow and brown arrows)]]

The '''trade winds''' are the [[Prevailing winds|prevailing pattern]] of surface [[wind]]s from the east toward the west (easterly) found in the [[tropics]], within the lower portion of the [[Earth's atmosphere]], in the lower part of the [[troposphere]] near the Earth's [[equator]]. The trade winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and from the southeast in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], strengthening during the winter and when the [[Arctic oscillation]] is in its warm phase. Trade winds have been used by captains of [[sailing ship]]s to cross the world's oceans for centuries, and enabled colonial expansion into the Americas and trade routes to become established across the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific ocean]]s.

In [[meteorology]], the trade winds act as the [[prevailing winds|steering flow]] for [[tropical storms]] that form over the Atlantic, Pacific, and southern [[Indian Ocean]]s and make landfall in North America, Southeast Asia, and Madagascar and eastern Africa, respectively. Trade winds also transport African dust westward across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] into the [[Caribbean Sea]], as well as portions of southeastern [[North America]]. Shallow [[cumulus cloud]]s are seen within trade wind regimes, and are capped from becoming taller by a trade wind inversion, which is caused by descending air aloft from within the [[subtropical ridge]]. The weaker the trade winds become, the more rainfall can be expected in the neighboring landmasses.

== History ==
[[Image:Spanish Galleon.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Spanish galleon]]
{{See also|Age of Discovery|Volta do Mar|Age of sail}}
The term ''trade winds'' originally derives from the early fourteenth century late [[Middle English]] word "trade," meaning "path" or "track."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carol G. Braham |author2=Enid Pearsons |author3=Deborah M. Posner |author4=Georgia S.

Muelder|page=38|publisher=Read Books|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4067-7740-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; From West Africa, the Portuguese had to sail away from continental Africa, that is, to west and northwest. They could then turn northeast, to the area around the [[Azores]] islands, and finally east to mainland Europe. They also learned that to reach South Africa, they needed to go far out in the ocean, head for Brazil, and around 30°S go east again. Following the African coast southbound means upwind in the Southern hemisphere. In the Pacific ocean, the full wind circulation, which included both the trade wind easterlies and higher-latitude [[Westerlies]], was unknown to Europeans until [[Andres de Urdaneta]]'s voyage in 1565.&lt;ref name="pg18"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Z26YL407SkC&amp;pg=PA152|author=Derek Hayes|title=Historical atlas of the North Pacific Ocean: maps of discovery and scientific exploration, 1500–2000|page=18|publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre|year=2001|isbn=978-1-55054-865-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The captain of a sailing ship seeks a course along which the winds can be expected to blow in the direction of travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V0wAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA19|title=A text-book of commercial geography|author=Cyrus Cornelius Adams|page=19|publisher=D. Appleton and company|year=1904}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Sail]], the pattern of [[prevailing winds]] made various points of the globe easy or difficult to access, and therefore had a direct effect on European empire-building and thus on modern political geography. For example, [[Manila galleon]]s could not sail into the wind at all.&lt;ref name="pg18"/&gt;

[[File:Edmond Halley's map of the trade winds, 1686.jpg|thumb|275px|[[Edmond Halley]]'s map of the trade winds, 1686]]
By the 18th century, the importance of the trade winds to England's merchant fleet for crossing the Atlantic Ocean had led both the general public and etymologists to identify the name with a later meaning of "trade": "(foreign) commerce".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=2|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1847 and 1849, [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]] collected enough information to create wind and current charts for the world's oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Z26YL407SkC&amp;pg=PA152|author=Derek Hayes|title=Historical atlas of the North Pacific Ocean: maps of discovery and scientific exploration, 1500–2000|page=152|publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre|year=2001|isbn=978-1-55054-865-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Hadley cell]], surface air flows toward the equator while the flow aloft is towards the [[geographic pole|poles]].

The subsident (sinking) air is relatively dry because as it descends, the temperature increases, but the absolute humidity remains constant, which lowers the relative humidity of the air mass. This warm, dry air is known as a superior air mass and normally resides above a maritime tropical (warm and moist) air mass. An increase of temperature with height is known as a temperature inversion. When it occurs within a trade wind regime, it is known as a trade wind inversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=superior+air&amp;submit=Search|title=Superior air|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2009-10-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606104219/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=superior+air&amp;submit=Search|archivedate=2011-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface air that flows from these subtropical high-pressure belts toward the Equator is deflected toward the west in both hemispheres by the [[Coriolis effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Glossary of Meteorology |title=trade winds |work=Glossary of Meteorology |publisher=American Meteorological Society |year=2009 |accessdate=2008-09-08 |url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=trade-winds1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211050708/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=trade-winds1 |archivedate=2008-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and from the southeast in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].&lt;ref name="Ralph"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ralph Stockman Tarr|author2=Frank Morton McMurry|author3=Almon Ernest Parkins|title=Advanced geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLMXAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA246|year=1909|publisher=State Printing|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Because winds are named for the direction from which the wind is blowing,&lt;ref name="HOWTOREAD"&gt;{{cite web|author=JetStream|year=2008|url=http://www.srh.weather.gov/srh/jetstream/synoptic/wxmaps.htm|title=How to read weather maps|publisher=[[National Weather Service]]|accessdate=2007-05-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68bsDeVx8?url=http://www.srh.weather.gov/srh/jetstream/synoptic/wxmaps.htm|archivedate=2012-06-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; these winds are called the northeasterly trade winds in the Northern Hemisphere and the southeasterly trade winds in the Southern Hemisphere.

As they blow across tropical regions, air masses heat up over lower latitudes due to more direct sunlight.

During mid-summer in the Northern Hemisphere (July), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving [[subtropical ridge]] expand northwestward from the [[Caribbean sea]] into southeastern North America (Florida and Gulf Coast). When dust from the [[Sahara]] moving around the southern periphery of the ridge travels over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts [[air quality]] by adding to the count of airborne particulates.&lt;ref name="pooraq"&gt;Science Daily (1999-07-14).

The '''Tsiv-Gombori''' ({{lang-ka|ცივ-გომბორის ქედი}}) or '''Gombori''' (გომბორი) is a [[mountain range]] in the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] section of [[Greater Caucasus]] mountains. It is located in the province of [[Kakheti]], eastern Georgia, and stretches to the distance of 107&amp;nbsp;km, with the highest mountain being at 1.991 m above sea level. 

The Gombori range serves as a watershed, separating the [[Alazani]] and [[River Iori|Iori]] river valleys, thereby dividing Kakheti into two traditional regions: inner (Shida) and outer (Gare). The slopes of the range are traversed by several smaller river gorges. The Alazani passes through the mountain range affecting the overall climatic conditions in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samtrest.gov.ge/index.php?action=page&amp;lang=eng&amp;p_id=212 |title=Specific Zone ''Kakheti'' |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mariamjvari Strict Nature Reserve]] is located in the southern side of the range. Both northern and southern slopes are home to [[Pine|pine forests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://na-mo.web.officelive.com/mariamjvari.aspx |title=Nature Monuments.

Tsiv-Gombori has been mentioned in media reports as a possible location for the US radar station for [[anti-ballistic missile]] systems which could provide surveillance of activities in Iran and up to the territory of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vestikavkaza.ru/analytics/politika/36413.html |title=Дислокация радара – элемент военного присутствия США в Грузии |trans-title=Location of radar - element of presence of US in Georgia |publisher=Vestnik Kavkaza |author=Georgiy Kalatozishvili |date=2011-04-29 |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vilnia''' (also ''Vilnelė''; {{Lang-be|Вільня}}, ''Vilnia'' {{IPA-be|ˈvʲilʲnʲa|}}; {{Lang-pl|Wilejka, Wilenka}}) is a [[river]] in [[Lithuania]]. Its source is near the village of Vindžiūnai, 5&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Šumskas]], at the Lithuanian-[[Belarus]]ian border. The Vilnia is 79.6&amp;nbsp;km long&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{cite web|title=IMPACT OF SMALL HYDRO-POWER PLANTS ON SALMONID FISHES SPAWNING MIGRATIONS|url=http://www.mla.vgtu.lt/upload/jmk_zurn/mla_vol1_no4_80-85_stakenas.pdf|publisher=[[Vilnius University]] Institute of Ecology|accessdate=2010-02-24}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its basin covers 624&amp;nbsp;sq.&amp;nbsp;km. For 13&amp;nbsp;km its flow makes the [[Belarus-Lithuania border]], and the remaining 69&amp;nbsp;km are in Lithuania until it flows into the [[Neris River]] at [[Vilnius]]. Eventually, its waters, via the Neris's drainage into the [[Neman River]], flow into the [[Baltic Sea]]. Its [[confluence]] with the Neris lies within the city of [[Vilnius]], and the river's name was probably the source of the city's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the literary cultures of East-Central Europe: junctures and disjunctures in the 19th and 20th centuries|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5pAwqsSyTlsC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Vilnia+name+vilnius&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=Vilnia%20name%20vilnius|publisher=[[John Benjamins Publishing]]|year=2004|author=Marcel Cornis-Pope, John Neubauer|isbn=978-90-272-3453-7|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the river derives from the [[Lithuanian language]] word ''vilnis'' ("a surge") or ''vilnyti'' ("to surge").

''Vilnelė'', the [[diminutive]] form of the original [[hydronym]] ''Vilnia'', came into popular use in Lithuanian and largely replaced the latter.

In an effort to restore the upstream migration of [[salmonids]] in the basin, a [[fish ladder]] was constructed on the Vilnia in 2000.&lt;ref name=impact/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1865">[[File:Zero-curtain-effect.svg|thumb|Theoretical illustration of the zero-curtain effect over a 12-month period]]

The '''zero-curtain effect''' occurs in cold (particularly [[periglacial]]) environments where the [[phase transition]] of [[water]] to [[ice]] is slowed down due to [[latent heat]] release. The effect is notably found in [[arctic]] and [[alpine climate|alpine]] [[permafrost]] sediments, and occurs where the air temperature falls below 0'''°'''C (the [[freezing point]] of water) followed by a rapid drop in soil temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 22| issue = 4| pages = 425–437| last = Kelley| first = J. J.|author2=D. F. Weaver | title = Physical processes at the surface of the arctic tundra| journal = Arctic| year = 1969| url = http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic22-4-425.pdf| doi=10.14430/arctic3233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this effect, the lowering of temperature in moist, cold ground does not happen at a uniform rate. The loss of heat through conduction is reduced when water freezes, and latent heat is released. This heat of fusion is continually released until all the subsurface water has frozen, at which point temperatures can continue to fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 8| issue = 4| pages = 237–249| last = Cook| first = F. A| title = Near surface soil temperature measurements at Resolute Bay, Northwest Territories| journal = Arctic| year = 1955| url = http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/arctic8-4-237.pdf| doi=10.14430/arctic3822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, for as long as water is available to the system (for example, through [[cryosuction]]/[[capillary action]]) the temperature of the sediment will remain at a constant temperature.

Retrieved 20 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[strait]] which forms the [[Denmark–Sweden border|Danish–Swedish border]], separating [[Zealand]] ([[Denmark]]) from [[Scania]] ([[Sweden]]).  The strait has a length of {{convert|118|km}} and the width varies from {{convert|4|km}} to {{convert|28|km}}. It is {{convert|4|km}} wide at its narrowest point between [[Helsingør]] in Denmark and [[Helsingborg]] in Sweden.

Øresund is along with the [[Great Belt]], [[Little Belt]] and [[Kiel Canal]] one of four waterways that connects the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] via [[Kattegat]], [[Skagerrak]], and the [[North Sea]], and is one of the busiest waterways in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=t3DXmc-mFhEC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=%F6resund+ship+traffic#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |first=Henrik |last=Gluver |author2=Dan Olsen  |title=Ship Collision Analysis |chapter=2.7 Øresund Bridge, Denmark-Sweden |year=1998 |publisher=A.

The [[Øresund Bridge]], between the Danish capital [[Copenhagen]] and the Swedish city of [[Malmö]],  inaugurated on 1 July 2000, connects a bi-national [[Øresund Region|metropolitan area]] with close to 4 million inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;The region has a population of 3,894,365 (2015) and a population density of 187/km². {{cite web|title=Geography|url=http://www.tendensoresund.org/en/geography|publisher=Tendens Øresund|accessdate=29 October 2010}}. On 1 January 2016 the name of the region was changed to "Greater Copenhagen and Skåne" by the Øresund Committee.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[HH Ferry route]], between [[Helsingør]], Denmark and [[Helsingborg]], Sweden, in the northern part of Øresund, is one of the world's busiest international ferry routes with more than 70 departures from each harbour per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At Scandlines|url=http://www.scandlines.se/tider-och-priser/tidtabell.aspx}} press "Tidtabell 2 jan-31 maj 2015", PDF file.&lt;/ref&gt;

Øresund is a [[deep time|geologically young]] strait that formed 8500–8000 years ago as a result of [[sea level rise|rising sea level]]s. Previously the [[Ancylus Lake]], a fresh-water body occupying the Baltic basin, had been connected to the sea solely by the [[Great Belt]]. As such the entrance of salt water by Øresund marked the beginning of the modern Baltic Sea as a salt-water sea.&lt;ref name=Bjorcketal2008&gt;{{cite book|last1=Björck |first1=Svante |last2=Andrén |first2=Thomas |last3=Jensen |first3=Jørn Bo |author-link1=Svante Björck|date=2008 |chapter=An attempt to resolve the partly conflicting data and ideas on the ancylus-Littorina transition |chapter-url=https://www.pgi.gov.pl/en/docman-tree/publikacje-2/special-papers/23/1551-sp23-bjorck/file.html |title=Proceedings of the Workshop "Relative sea level changes" |series=Polish Geological Institute Special Papers |volume=23 |pages=21–26 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The strait is called ''Øresund'' in [[Danish language|Danish]] and ''Öresund'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], informally ''Sundet''&lt;ref name=runeberg&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/nfcn/0093.html|title=141-142 (Nordisk familjebok / Uggleupplagan. 34. Ö - Öyslebö; supplement: Aa - Cambon)|date=1922|website=runeberg.org|language=sv|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (lit. "the Strait") in both languages.
The first part of the name is ''[[:wikt:eyra#Old Norse|øre]]'' "gravel/sand beach", and the second part is ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/sundą|sund]]'', i.e. "sound, strait".

The name is first attested on a [[Mejlbystenen|runestone]] dated to ca. AD 1000, where it is written as ''ura suti'', read as [[Old East Norse]] {{IPA|/øːrasundi/}} (the dative case).&lt;ref&gt;[[Mejlbystenen]], [[Rundata|DR]] 117. {{lang|non|᛬ᛁ᛬ᚢᚱᛅ᛬ᛋᚢᛏᛁ᛬}} "in the ear-sound".&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Old West Norse]] (and [[Icelandic language|modern Icelandic]]) form of the name is ''Eyrarsund''. 
''Ör'' is the modern form of the old Norse word (aur) meaning a gravel beach or shoal (see also [[Ayre (landform)|ayre]]), often forming a [[Spit (landform)|spit]]. Such landforms are common in the area and "ör" is found in many place names along the strait e.g. [[Helsingør]], [[Skanör]], [[Dragør]] and [[Halör]], an important center of trade during the [[Viking Age]].&lt;ref name=runeberg/&gt;

The northern boundary between Øresund and [[Kattegat]] is a line which goes from [[Gilleleje]] at Zealand's northern peak to the westernmost point of [[Kullaberg]] (Kullen's Lighthouse) at the smaller peninsula north of [[Helsingborg]], known as [[Kullaberg|Kullahalvön]]. In the south, the boundary towards the [[Baltic Sea]] starts at [[Stevns Klint]], at the westernmost peak of the peninsula just south of [[Køge Bay]], [[Stevns Peninsula]] to [[Falsterbo]] at the Falsterbo peninsula. 
Its eastern boundary is the Swedish coastline; to the west [[Amager]] may be considered part of Øresund (in which case it is the largest island) or a part of Zealand. Amager has eight connections with Zealand (two street bridges, a road bridge, a motorway bridge, a dual-track railway tunnel, an underground metro and a bicycle bridge) as well as a combined motorway and dual track railway to Scania and Sweden.

==Streams, animals and salinity==
Øresund, like other Danish and Danish-German straits, is at the border between oceanic salt water (which has a salinity of more than 30 [[Salinity#Seawater|PSU]] or [[per mille]] by weight) and the far less salty [[Baltic Sea]].

As the [[Kattegat]] in the north has almost oceanic conditions and the Baltic Sea (around 7 PSU, in its main basin) has [[brackish]] water, Øresund's water conditions are rather unusual and shifting. The streams are very complex, but the ''surface'' stream is often northbound (from the Baltic Sea) which gives a lower surface salinity, though streams can change from one day to another. The ''average'' surface salinity is about 10–12&amp;nbsp;PSU in the southern part but above 20 PSU north of Helsingør.

Near the seafloor (where the sea is deep enough), conditions are more stable and salinity is always oceanic (above 30 PSU) below a certain depth that varies between 10 and 15 metres. In the southern part, however, the depth is 5–6 metres (outside the rather narrow waterways [[Drogden]] and [[Flintrännan]]), and this is the definite border of oceanic salt water, therefore also a border for many maritime species of animals. Only 52 known salt-water species reside in the central Baltic Sea, compared to around 1500 in the [[North Sea]]. Close to 600 species are known to exist in at least some part of Øresund. Well-known examples, for which the bottom salinity makes a distinct breeding border, include lobster, small crabs ([[Carcinus maenas]]), several species of [[flatfish]] and the [[lion's mane jellyfish]]; the latter can sometimes drift into the southwest Baltic Sea, but it cannot reproduce there.

There are daily tides, but the lunar attraction cannot force much water to move from west to east, or vice versa, in narrow waters where the current is either northbound or southbound. So, not much of the difference in water levels in Øresund is due to daily tides, and other circumstances "hide" the little tide that still remains. The current has a much stronger effect than the tide on the water level, but strong winds may also affect the water level. During exceptional conditions, such as storms and hurricanes, oceanic water may suddenly flow into the Baltic Sea at all depths. Such events give deep waters in the southern Baltic Sea higher salinity, which makes it possible for [[Atlantic cod|cod]] to breed there. If no such inflow of oceanic water to the Baltic Sea occurs for around a decade, the breeding of cod becomes endangered.

Generally, when the current shifts from northbound to southbound, it never turns 180 degrees with the same flow, instead does the current "slow down to zero" and then begins to flow in opposite direction. (Local phenomenon close to shores, might differ from this general pattern)

==History==
{{Main|Sound Dues}}

Political control of Øresund has been an important issue in Danish and [[Sweden|Swedish]] history. Denmark maintained [[military]] control with the [[coast]]al [[fortress]] of [[Kronborg]] at [[Elsinore]] on the west side and [[Kärnan]] at [[Helsingborg]] on the east, until the eastern shore was ceded to Sweden in 1658, based on the [[Treaty of Roskilde]]. Both fortresses are located where the strait is 4 kilometres wide.

In 1429, King [[Eric of Pomerania]] introduced the [[Sound Dues]] which remained in effect for more than four centuries, until 1857. Transitory dues on the use of waterways, roads, bridges and crossings were then an accepted way of taxing which could constitute a great part of a state's income. 
The Strait Dues remained the most important source of income for the Danish Crown for several centuries, thus making Danish kings relatively independent of Denmark's [[Privy Council of Denmark|Privy Council]] and [[aristocracy]].

To be independent of the Øresund, Sweden carried out two great projects, the foundation of Göteborg ([[Gothenborg]]) in 1621 and the construction of the [[Göta Canal]] from 1810 to 1832.

The [[Copenhagen Convention of 1857]] abolished the Dues and made the Danish straits an [[international waterway]].

A fixed connection was opened across the strait in 2000, the [[Øresund Bridge]].
