The '''1996 France – United Kingdom Maritime Delimitation Agreements''' are two [[treaty|treaties]] between [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]] which [[boundary delimitation|establish]] a number of [[maritime boundary]] between French territories and British territories in the [[Caribbean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Ewan W. (2003). {{Google books|E7-menNPxREC|''International Boundaries: A Geopolitical Atlas,'' p. 297.|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both treaties were signed in [[London]] on 27 June 1996. The two treaties entered into force on 30 January 1997 after they had been [[ratification|ratified]] by both states.

==First treaty==
The first treaty delimits the [[border|boundary]] in the [[Anguilla Channel]] between the British territory of [[Anguilla]] and the French territories of [[Saint Martin (France)|Saint Martin]] and [[Saint Barthélemy]]. The boundary is a simplified equidistant [[ocean|maritime]] line that runs in roughly an east–west direction. It consists of seven straight-line segments defined by eight individual coordinate points. The western end of the border forms a [[tripoint]] with the [[Netherlands Antilles]] and the easternmost end of the border forms the tripoint with [[Antigua and Barbuda]]. The full name of the treaty is ''Agreement on maritime delimitation between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy, on one hand, and Anguilla on the other''.

When the treaty was signed, Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy were both part of the [[Guadeloupe]] [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas department]] of France. In 2007, Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy became two separate [[Overseas departments and territories of France#Overseas collectivities|overseas collectivities]] of France. As a result, the first treaty now defines only the Anguilla – Saint Martin maritime boundary. There is no maritime boundary between Anguilla and the separate collectivity of Saint Barthélemy.

==Second treaty==
The second treaty delimits the boundary between the British territory of [[Montserrat]] and the French territory of [[Guadeloupe]]. The boundary is a simplified equidistant line that runs through the [[Guadeloupe Passage]] in roughly an east–west direction. It consists of four straight-line segments defined by five individual coordinate points. The western end of the border forms the [[tripoint]] with [[Venezuela]] and the easternmost end of the border forms a tripoint with [[Antigua and Barbuda]]. The full name of the treaty is ''Agreement on maritime delimitation between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning Guadeloupe and Montserrat''.

Some monarchies have weak or symbolic legislatures and other governmental bodies the monarch can alter or dissolve at will. Countries where monarchs still maintain absolute power are: [[Brunei]], [[Oman]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Swaziland|Eswatini]], [[Vatican City]] and the individual emirates composing the [[United Arab Emirates]], which itself is a [[federation]] of such monarchies – a [[federal monarchy]].&lt;ref name="qat-abs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Qatar: regional backwater to global player|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20890765|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oman-abs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A: Elections to Oman's Consultative Council|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15288960|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cavendish78"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swazi-abs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Swaziland profile|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14095303|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vaticancity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/vaticanstate/en/stato-e-governo/organi-dello-stato.html |title=State Departments |publisher=Vaticanstate.va |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vatican to Emirates, monarchs keep the reins in modern world|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-02/education/29495629_1_monarchy-absolute-power-head|publisher=Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and examples of absolute monarchies==

===Outside Europe===
In [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Pharaoh]] wielded absolute power over the country and was considered a [[thearch|living god]] by his people. In [[ancient Mesopotamia]], many rulers of [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]] and [[Sumer]] were absolute monarchs as well. In ancient and medieval India, rulers of the [[Maurya]], [[Satavahana Dynasty|Satavahana]], [[Gupta]] and [[Chalukya]] Empires, as well as other major and minor empires, were considered absolute monarchs. In the [[Khmer Empire]], the kings were called "[[Devaraja]]" and "[[Chakravartin]]" (King of the world), and exercised absolute power over the empire and people. 

Throughout [[Imperial China]], many [[Emperor of China|emperors]] and [[Wu Zetian|one empress]] wielded absolute power through the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. In [[pre-Columbian America]], the [[Inca Empire]] was ruled by a [[Sapa Inca]], who was considered the son of [[Inti]], the sun god and absolute ruler over the people and nation. Korea under the [[Joseon dynasty]] and short-lived [[Korean Empire|empire]] was also an absolute monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWNNWVwaUpMC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=joseon+dynasty+absolute+monarchy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Pvvg4ATlGS&amp;sig=Lvx9Jlla_3RNFvAKHtxn_42P98Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK_YPu9Y_XAhXDJCYKHT0dASsQ6AEIaDAM#v=onepage&amp;q=joseon+dynasty+absolute+monarchy&amp;f=false|title=Interior Space and Furniture of Joseon Upper-class Houses|first=Sang-hun|last=Choi|date=27 October 2017|publisher=Ewha Womans University Press|via=Google Books|page=16|quote=Joseon was an absolute monarchy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Ottoman Empire]], many sultans wielded absolute power through heavenly mandates reflected in their title, the "Shadow of God on Earth".

===Europe===
Throughout much of European history, the [[divine right of kings]] was the theological justification for absolute monarchy. Many European monarchs, such as those of [[Russia]], claimed [[Tsarist autocracy|supreme autocratic power]] by divine right, and that their subjects had no rights to limit their power. [[James I of England|James VI]] of [[Scotland]] (later also James I of [[England]]) and his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] of Scotland and England tried to import this principle. Charles I's attempt to enforce [[episcopal polity]] on the [[Church of Scotland]] led to rebellion by the [[Covenanter]]s and the [[Bishops' Wars]], then fears that Charles I was attempting to establish absolutist government along European lines was a major cause of the [[English Civil War]], despite the fact that he did rule this way for 11 years starting in 1629, after dissolving the [[Parliament of England]] for a time. By the 19th century, the Divine Right was regarded as an obsolete theory in most countries in the [[Western world]], except in Russia where it was still given credence as the official justification for the Tsar's power until [[February Revolution]] in 1917.

There is a considerable variety of opinion by historians on the extent of absolutism among European monarchs. Some, such as [[Perry Anderson]], argue that quite a few monarchs achieved levels of absolutist control over their states, while historians such as Roger Mettam dispute the very concept of absolutism.&lt;ref&gt;Mettam, Roger.  ''Power and Faction in Louis XIV's France'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, historians who disagree with the appellation of ''absolutism'' argue that most monarchs labeled as ''absolutist'' exerted no greater power over their subjects than any other ''non-absolutist'' rulers, and these historians tend to emphasize the differences between the absolutist [[rhetoric]] of monarchs and the realities of the effective use of power by these absolute monarchs.  Renaissance historian William Bouwsma summed up this contradiction:
{{quote|Nothing so clearly indicates the limits of royal power as the fact that governments were perennially in financial trouble, unable to tap the wealth of those ablest to pay, and likely to stir up a costly revolt whenever they attempted to develop an adequate income.&lt;ref&gt;Bouwsma, William J., in Kimmel, Michael S. ''Absolutism and Its Discontents: State and Society in Seventeenth-Century France and England''.  New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Books, 1988, 15&lt;/ref&gt;|William Bouwsma}}

====France====
{{further information|Absolute monarchy in France}}
[[File:Louis XIV of France.jpg|thumb|right|[[Louis XIV of France]]]]
Though some historians{{who|date=October 2018}} doubt if he truly had, [[Louis XIV of France]] (1638&amp;ndash;1715) is often said to have proclaimed "L'état, c'est moi" ("I am the State!").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.history.com/topics/france/louis-xiv|title=Louis XIV|work=HISTORY|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although often criticized for his extravagances, such as the [[Palace of Versailles]], he reigned over France for a long period, and some historians consider him a successful absolute monarch. More recently, revisionist historians{{who|date=October 2018}} have questioned whether Louis' reign should be considered 'absolute'{{Such as?|date=October 2018}}, given the reality of the balance of power between the monarch and the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Mettam, R. ''Power and Faction in Louis XIV's France'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=October 2018}}

The King of France concentrated in his person legislative, executive, and judicial powers. He was the supreme judicial authority. He could condemn men to death without the right of appeal. It was both his duty to punish offenses and stop them from being committed. From his judicial authority followed his power both to make laws and to annul them.&lt;ref&gt;Mousnier, R. ''The Institutions of France under the Absolute Monarchy, 1598-2012 V1.'' Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his steps in creating an absolute monarchy in France was to build the Palace of Versailles, where he lived with many of his nobles and other important people, in order to control and watch over them.&lt;ref&gt;Holt World History. ''France in the Age of Absolutism'' Austin: Rinehart and Winston, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark–Norway====
Absolutism was underpinned by a written constitution for the first time in Europe in 1665 ''Kongeloven ("King's Law")'' of [[Denmark-Norway]], which ordered that the Monarch "shall from this day forth be revered and considered the most perfect and supreme person on the Earth by all his subjects, standing above all human laws and having no judge above his person, neither in spiritual nor temporal matters, except God alone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://danskekonger.dk/kilder/kongeloven |title=Kongeloven af 1665 |publisher=Danske konger |language=da |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330135036/http://danskekonger.dk/kilder/kongeloven |archivedate=2012-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A partial English translation of the law can be found in Ernst Ekman, "The Danish Royal Law of 1665" pp. 102-107 in: ''The Journal of Modern History'', 1957, vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This law consequently authorized the king to abolish all other centers of power. Most important was the abolition of the [[Rigsraad|Council of the Realm]].

====Prussia====
In [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], the concept of absolute monarch took a notable turn from the above with its emphasis on the monarch as the "first servant of the state", but it also echoed many of the important characteristics of Absolutism. [[Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]] (r. 1640–1688), known as the Great Elector, used the uncertainties of the final stages of the [[Thirty Years' War]]{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} to consolidate his territories into the dominant kingdom in northern Germany, whilst increasing his power over his subjects. His actions largely originated the militaristic streak of the [[Hohenzollern]].

In 1653 the Diet of Brandenburg met for the last time and gave Frederick William the power to raise taxes without its consent, a strong indicator of absolutism. Frederick William enjoyed support from the nobles, who enabled the Great Elector to undermine the Diet and other representative assemblies. The leading families saw their future in cooperation with the central government and worked to establish absolutist power.

The most significant indicator of the nobles' success was the establishment of two tax rates – one for the cities and the other for the countryside &amp;ndash; to the great advantage of the latter, which the nobles ruled. The nobles served in the upper levels of the elector's army and bureaucracy, but they also won new prosperity for themselves. The support of the Elector enabled the imposition of serfdom and the consolidation of land holdings into vast estates which provided for their wealth.

They became known as [[Junker]]s (from the German for young lord, ''junger Herr''). Frederick William faced resistance from representative assemblies and long-independent cities in his realm. City leaders often revolted at the imposition of Electorate authority. The last notable effort was the uprising of the city of [[Königsberg]] which allied with the Estates General of Prussia to refuse to pay taxes. Frederick William crushed this revolt in 1662, by marching into the city with thousands of troops. A similar approach was used with the towns of Cleves.&lt;ref&gt;''The Western Experience'', Seventh Edition, Boston: [[McGraw-Hill]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russia====
Until 1905 the [[Tsar]]s of [[Russia]] governed as absolute monarchs. [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I the Great]] reduced the power of the [[Boyar|Russian nobility]] and strengthened the central power of the Tsars, establishing a bureaucracy and a [[police state]]. This tradition of absolutism, known as [[Tsarist autocracy]], was expanded by [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II the Great]] and her descendants. Although [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] made some reforms and established an independent judicial system, Russia did not have a representative assembly or a constitution until the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|1905 Revolution]]. However, the concept of absolutism was so ingrained in Russia that the [[Russian Constitution of 1906]] still described the Tsar as an autocrat. Russia became the last [[Europe]] a country (excluding [[Vatican City]]) to abolish absolutism, and it was the only one to do so as late as the 20th century (the [[Ottoman Empire]] drafted its first constitution in 1877).

====Sweden====
The form of government instituted in [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] under King [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]] and passed on to his son, [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] is commonly referred to as absolute monarchy; however, the Swedish monarch was never absolute in the sense that he wielded [[arbitrary power]]. The monarch still ruled under the law and could only legislate in agreement with the [[Riksdag of the Estates]]; rather, the absolutism introduced was the monarch's ability to run the government unfettered by the [[Privy Council of Sweden|privy council]], contrary to earlier practice. The absolute rule of Charles XI was instituted by the crown and the Riksdag in order to carry out the [[Reduction (Sweden)|Great Reduction]] which would have been made impossible by the privy council which comprised the high nobility. After the death of Charles XII in 1718, the system of absolute rule was largely blamed for the ruination of the realm in the [[Great Northern War]], and the reaction tipped the balance of power to the other extreme end of the spectrum, ushering in the [[Age of Liberty]]. After half a century of largely unrestricted parliamentary rule proved just as ruinous, King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] seized back royal power in the coup d'état of 1772, and later once again abolished the privy council under the [[Union and Security Act]] in 1789, which, in turn, was rendered void in 1809 when [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV Adolf]] was deposed in a coup and the [[Instrument of Government (1809)|constitution of 1809]] was put in its place. The years between 1789 and 1809, then, are also referred to as a period of absolute monarchy.

==Contemporary monarchies==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2015}}
The popularity of the notion of absolute monarchy declined substantially after the [[American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]], which promoted theories of government based on [[popular sovereignty]].

Many nations formerly with absolute monarchies, such as [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]] and [[Morocco]], have moved towards [[constitutional monarchy]], although in some cases the monarch retains tremendous power, to the point that the parliament's influence on political life is negligible.

In [[Bhutan]], the government moved from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy following planned parliamentary elections to the [[Tshogdu]] in 2003, and the [[Bhutanese National Assembly election, 2008|election of a National Assembly in 2008]]. [[Nepal]] had several swings between constitutional rule and direct rule related to the [[Nepalese Civil War]], the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|Maoist insurgency]], and the 2001 [[Nepalese royal massacre]], with the Nepalese monarchy being abolished on May 28, 2008. In [[Tonga]], the [[King of Tonga|King]] had majority control of the [[Legislative Assembly of Tonga|Legislative Assembly]] until 2010.

On the other hand, [[Liechtenstein]] has moved towards expanding the power of the monarch: the [[Prince of Liechtenstein]] was given expanded powers after a [[Liechtenstein constitutional referendum, 2003|referendum]] amending the [[Constitution of Liechtenstein]] in 2003, which led the BBC to describe the prince as an "absolute monarch again".&lt;ref name="Liechtenstein"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2853991.stm |title=Liechtenstein prince wins powers |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2015-10-26 |date=2003-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|ruling Kim family]] of [[North Korea]] ([[Kim Il-sung]], [[Kim Jong-il]] and [[Kim Jong-un]]) has been described as a ''de facto'' absolute monarchy&lt;ref&gt;Young W. Kihl, Hong Nack Kim. ''North Korea: The Politics of Regime Survival''. Armonk, New York, USA: M. E. Sharpe, Inc., 2006. Pp 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Scalapino, Chong-Sik Lee.

{{Main article|Politics of Saudi Arabia}}

Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy, and according to the [[Basic Law of Saudi Arabia]] adopted by royal decree in 1992, the king must comply with [[Shari'a]] (Islamic law) and the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name=Cavendish78&gt;{{cite book |title=World and Its Peoples: the Arabian Peninsula |last=Cavendish |first=Marshall |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7614-7571-2 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an and the corpus of [[Sunnah]] (traditions of the Islamic [[Prophets in Islam|prophet]], [[Muhammad]]) are declared to be the Kingdom's constitution, but no written modern constitution has ever been written for Saudi Arabia, which remains one of two Arab nations where no national elections have ever taken place since its founding, with the other being Qatar.&lt;ref name= Gerhard&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of world constitutions, Volume 1 |last=Robbers |first=Gerhard |year=2007 |isbn=0-8160-6078-9 |page=791}}&lt;/ref&gt; No political parties or national elections are permitted and according to ''[[The Economist]]'s'' 2010 [[Democracy Index]], the Saudi government is the seventh most authoritarian regime from among the 167 countries rated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://graphics.eiu.com/PDF/Democracy_Index_2010_web.pdf |title=The Economist Democracy Index 2010 |author=The Economist Intelligence Unit |work=The Economist |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cavendish78/&gt;

==Scholarship==
[[Anthropology]], [[sociology]], and [[ethology]] as well as various other disciplines such as [[political science]] attempt to explain the rise of absolute monarchy ranging from extrapolation generally, to certain [[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon|Marxist explanations]] in terms of the [[class struggle]] as the underlying dynamic of human historical development generally and absolute monarchy in particular.

In the 17th century, French legal theorist [[Jean Domat]] defended the concept of absolute monarchy in works such as ''"On Social Order and Absolute Monarchy"'', citing absolute monarchy as preserving natural [[Orderliness|order]] as [[God]] intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://symposium.cornellcollege.edu/2009/04/18/jean-domat-on-defense-of-absolute-monarchy/|title=Jean Domat: On Defense of Absolute Monarchy - Cornell College Student Symposium|date=18 April 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Article 32 hearing''' is a proceeding under the [[United States]] [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], similar to that of a [[preliminary hearing]] in civilian law.  Its name is derived from UCMJ section VII ("Trial Procedure") Article [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/832- 32] (10 U.S.C. § 832), which mandates the hearing.

The UCMJ specifies several different levels of formality with which infractions can be dealt.  The most serious is a ''general [[court-martial]]''.  An article 32 hearing is required before a defendant can be referred to a general court-martial, in order to determine whether there is enough evidence to merit a general court-martial.  Offenders in the US military may face [[Nonjudicial punishment|non-judicial punishment]], a [[summary court-martial]],  special court-martial, general court-martial, or administrative separation.  A commanding officer, in the role as court-martial [[Convening authority (court-martial)|convening authority]], will consult with the command [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|judge advocate]] for advice on case disposition; factors to be considered include, ''inter alia'', the relevant statutory and case law, the seriousness of the offenses, the strength or weakness of each element of the case,  the promotion of good order and discipline, and the commander's desire for case disposition.

An investigation is normally directed when it appears the charges are of such a serious nature that trial by general court-martial may be warranted.  The commander directing an investigation under Article 32 details a [[commissioned officer]] as investigating officer who will conduct the investigation and make a report of conclusions and recommendations.  This officer is never the accuser, trial counsel (judge advocate prosecutor), nor in the accused's [[command hierarchy|chain of command]].  This officer may or may not have any legal training, although the use of military attorneys (judge advocates) is recommended and common within service practice.  If the investigating officer is not a lawyer, he or she may seek legal advice from an impartial source, but may not obtain such advice from counsel for any party.

An investigative hearing is scheduled as soon as reasonably possible after the investigating officer’s appointment.  The hearing is normally attended by the investigating officer, the accused and the defense counsel.  The commander will ordinarily detail counsel to represent the United States, and in some cases a court reporter and an interpreter; these appointments are, in practical reality, duty assignments made by the criminal law branch of the command judge advocate's office.  Ordinarily, this investigative hearing is open to the public and the media.

The investigating officer will, generally, review all non-testimonial evidence and then proceed to examination of witnesses.  Except for a limited set of rules on privileges, interrogation, and the [[Rape shield law|rape-shield rule]] (MRE 412), the military [[rules of evidence]] do not apply at this investigative hearing. This does not mean, however, that the investigating officer ignores evidentiary issues. The investigating officer will comment on all evidentiary issues that are critical to a case’s disposition. All testimony is taken under oath or affirmation, except that an accused may make an unsworn statement.

The defense is given wide latitude in cross-examining witnesses. As of 2013 in cases where [[sexual assault]] is alleged some critics allege an extremely intrusive and aggressive cross examination of the victim is permitted, a practice which has been cited by critics of the military's handling of [[sexual assault in the United States military]]. In one case, a midshipman at the Navy Academy was interrogated for 30 hours over several days about their past sexual behavior.&lt;ref name=NYT92013&gt;{{cite news |title=Navy Hearing in Rape Case Raises Alarm |authorlink=Jennifer Steinhauer|first=Jennifer |last=Steinhauer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/us/intrusive-grilling-in-rape-case-raises-alarm-on-military-hearings.html|accessdate=September 21, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the commander details an attorney to represent the United States, this government representative will normally conduct a direct examination of the government witnesses. This is followed by cross-examination by the defense and examination by the investigating officer upon completion of questioning by both counsel. Likewise, if a defense witness is called, the defense counsel will normally conduct a direct examination followed by a government cross-examination. After redirect examination by the defense counsel, or completion of questioning by both counsel, the investigating officer may conduct additional examination. The exact procedures to be followed in the hearing are not specified in either the Uniform Code of Military Justice or the Manual for Court-Martial.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1823">A '''''Chambre ardente''''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃɑ̃bʁ aʁdɑ̃t}}, ''burning chamber'') was an extraordinary court of justice in ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' [[France]], mainly held for the trials of [[heresy|heretic]]s.

The name is perhaps an allusion to the fact that the proceedings took place in a room from which all daylight was excluded, the only illumination being from torches, or there may be a reference to the severity of the sentences in ''ardente'', suggesting the burning of the prisoners at the stake. These courts were originated by [[Jean, Cardinal of Lorraine]], the first of them meeting in 1535 under [[Francis I of France|Francis I]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Chambre Ardente|volume=5|page=823}} This further cites:
* N. Weiss, ''La Chambre Ardente'' (Paris, 1889)
* François Ravaisson, ''Archives de la Bastille'' (Paris, 1866-1884, 16 vols)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chambre Ardente co-operated with an [[inquisition|inquisitorial tribunal]] also established by Francis I, the duty of which was to discover cases of heresy and hand them over for final judgment to the Chambre ardente.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The reign of [[Henry II of France]] was particularly infamous for the cruelties perpetrated by this court on the [[Huguenot]]s. The [[Madame de Brinvilliers]] and her associates were tried in the Chambre Ardente between 1675 and 1680 (the [[Affair of the Poisons|affaire des poisons]]). The court was abolished in 1682.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''Chester Irving Barnard''' (November 7, 1886 – June 7, 1961) was an [[United States|American]] business [[Senior management|executive]], public administrator, and the author of pioneering work in [[management]] theory and [[organizational studies]]. His landmark 1938 book, ''[[The Functions of the Executive]]'', sets out a [[organization theory|theory of organization]] and of the functions of executives in organizations. The book has been widely assigned in university courses in [[management]] theory and [[industrial sociology|organizational sociology]].&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;[http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9199394 Chester (Irving) Barnard Biography (1886 - 1961)]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} on biography.com. Retrieved 16 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnard viewed organizations as systems of cooperation of human activity, and noted that they are typically short-lived. According to Barnard, organizations are generally not long-lived because they do not meet the two criteria necessary for survival: [[effectiveness]] and [[efficiency]].

== Biography ==
In his youth, Barnard worked on a farm, then studied economics at [[Harvard University]], earning money selling pianos and operating a dance band. He did not obtain his Harvard BA because he did his four-year work in three years and could not complete a science course, but a number of universities later granted him honorary doctorates.&lt;ref name = "RCST"&gt;R.C.S. Trahair (1994) "Barnard's executive functions" in ''From Aristotelian to Reaganomics''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnard joined the [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] (now AT&amp;T) in 1909. In 1927, he became president of the [[New Jersey Bell Telephone Company]]. During the [[Great Depression]], he directed the New Jersey state relief system.&lt;ref name = "Bio"/&gt;

He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1939.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was president of the [[United Service Organizations]] (USO), 1942-45. Upon retiring from business, he served as president of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], 1948–52, and as chairman of the [[National Science Foundation]], 1952-54.&lt;ref name = "Bio"/&gt; End 1950s he was among the first members of the [[Society for General Systems Research]].

== Work ==
Barnard viewed organizations as systems of cooperation of human activity, and noted that they are typically short-lived. It is rare for a firm to last more than a century. Similarly most nations last for less than a century. The only organization that can claim a substantial age is the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. According to Barnard, organizations are not long-lived because they do not meet the two criteria necessary for survival: [[effectiveness]] and [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]]. Effectiveness, is defined the usual way: as being able to accomplish stated goals. In contrast, Barnard's meaning of organizational efficiency differed substantially from the conventional use of the word. He defined efficiency of an organization as the degree to which that organization is able to satisfy the [[Motivation|motives]] of the individuals. If an organization satisfies the motives of its members while attaining its explicit goals, cooperation among its members will last.

Barnard was a great admirer of [[Talcott Parsons]] (1902–1979) and he and Parsons corresponded persistently. The two scholars would send manuscripts for commentary to each other and they would write long letters where they engage in a common theoretical discussion. The first correspondence between Barnard and Parsons began in the end of the 1930s and it persisted essentially to Barnard’s death in 1961.

=== The Functions of the Executive ===
{{Main|The Functions of the Executive}}
Barnard's classic 1938 book, ''The Functions of the Executive'' discusses, as the title suggests, the functions of the executive, but not from a merely intuitive point of view, but instead deriving them from his conception of cooperative systems.

Barnard summarized the functions of the executive as follows: 
* Establishing and maintaining a system of communication;
* Securing essential services from other members;
* Formulating organizational purposes and objectives.
* To manage people and make sure they do their jobs

=== Authority and incentives ===
Barnard formulated two interesting theories: one of [[authority]] and the other of [[incentives]]. Both are seen in the context of a [[communication system]] grounded in seven essential rules: 
* The channels of communication should be definite;
* Everyone should know of the channels of communication;
* Everyone should have access to the formal channels of communication;
* Lines of communication should be as short and as direct as possible;
* Competence of persons serving as communication centers should be adequate;
* The line of communication should not be interrupted when the organization is functioning;
* Every communication should be authenticated.

Thus, what makes a communication [[authoritative]], rests with the subordinate, rather than with his superior. Barnard's perspective had affinities to that of [[Mary Parker Follett]] and was very unusual for his time, and that has remained the case down to the present day. He seemed to argue that managers should obtain authority by treating subordinates with respect and competence.

As for incentives, he proposed two ways of convincing subordinates to cooperate: tangible incentives and [[persuasion]]. Barnard gives great importance to persuasion, much more than to economic incentives. He described four general, and four specific incentives. 
The specific incentives were:
# Money and other material inducements;
# Personal non-material opportunities for distinction;
# Desirable physical conditions of work;
# Ideal benefactions, such as [[pride of workmanship]] etc.

The general incentives were:
# Associated attractiveness (based upon compatibility with associates)
# Adaptation of working conditions to habitual methods and attitudes
# The opportunity for the feeling of enlarged participation in the course of events
# The condition of communing with others (personal comfort with social relations, opportunity for comradeship etc., )

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10014">In [[England and Wales]], a '''claims management company''' is a [[business]] that offers '''claims management services''' to the public. Claims management services consist of advice or services in respect of claims for [[damages|compensation]], [[restitution]], repayment or any other [[judicial remedy|remedy]] for loss or damage, or in respect of some other [[law of obligations|obligation]]. Claims management services cover [[litigation]], or claims under [[regulation]] schemes or voluntary arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Compensation Act 2006]], [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/ukpga_20060029_en_2#pt2-l1g4 s.4(2)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The abolition of [[legal aid]] for [[personal injury]] claims, the introduction of [[conditional fee agreement]]s and the appearance of and growth in claims management companies led to a rapid expansion of litigation from the mid-1990s. This led to public concern at the development of a "[[compensation culture]]". The collapse of claims management company the [[Accident Group]] in 2003 increased disquiet with the system. Such companies used aggressive [[sales]] techniques and exaggerated claims, [[profit (economics)|profit]]ing from exorbitant [[commission (remuneration)|commission]]s on [[after the event insurance]] policies. It was estimated that there were about 1,000 such companies in the UK in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | title=This disaster was no Accident | date=2003-06-11 | author=Robert Watts | work=[[Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate=2008-03-21 | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2003/06/08/ccacc08.xml }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was still evidence that many meritorious claims were discouraged by the difficulties and costs of litigation.&lt;ref&gt;Better Regulation Task Force (2004) ''pp''11-17&lt;/ref&gt;These concerns, especially around the operation of conditional fee agreements, led to regulation of the market by Part 2 of the [[Compensation Act 2006]].&lt;ref&gt;Department for Constitutional Affairs (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Office of Public Sector Information (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The activities regulated are those common to the market and which had caused concern:&lt;ref&gt;Compensation (Regulated Claims Management Services) Order 2006, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/3319/contents/made SI 2006/3319]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
In [[England and Wales]], as of 23 April 2007, an individual or a corporation may not, unless exempt or otherwise in receipt of a waiver, provide claims management services by way of business unless authorised by the [[Claims Management Services Regulator]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Compensation Act 2006]], [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/ukpga_20060029_en_2#pt2-l1g4 s.4(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="comm3"&gt;Compensation Act 2006 (Commencement No. 3) Order 2007, [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090518164321/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/si/si2007/uksi_20070922_en_1 SI 2007/922]&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a [[crime]] for an unauthorised person to provide or offer claims management services, or to pretend to be authorised. Offenders are punishable, on [[summary conviction]], by a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] of up to level 5 on the [[standard scale]] or 51 weeks' [[imprisonment]]. If convicted on [[indictment]] in the [[Crown Court]], offenders can be sentenced to an unlimited fine or two years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Compensation Act 2006]], [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/ukpga_20060029_en_2#pt2-l1g7 s.7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Compensation Act 2006]], [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/ukpga_20060029_en_2#pt2-l1g11 s.11]&lt;/ref&gt; Where a [[corporate crime]] is committed, the offender can only be fined and not imprisoned. The claims regulator also covers the processing and evaluation of complaints against claims management companies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claims Management Companies Q&amp;A]], [http://www.thepracticebridge.com/discussions/claims-management-faq/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solicitor]]s, [[barrister]]s, [[advocate]]s and some other [[lawyer]]s are exempt, as are:&lt;ref name="exempt"&gt;Compensation (Exemptions) Order 2007, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/uksi_20070209_en_1 SI 2007/209]&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Charitable organization|Charities]] and [[not for profit]] bodies;
*[[Motor Insurers' Bureau]];
*[[Medical Protection Society]], [[Medical Defence Union]], and [[Medical and Dental Defence Union of Scotland]]; and

Incidental referrals to lawyers are also exempt&lt;ref name="exempt"/&gt; as are services in respect of [[counterclaim]]s, or claims for [[joint and several liability|contribution]] or [[indemnity]].&lt;ref&gt;Compensation (Exemptions) (Amendment) (No.1) Order 2007, [http://www.england-legislation.hmso.gov.uk/si/si2007/uksi_20071090_en_1 SI 2007/1090]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims Management Services Regulator==
The '''Claims Management Services Regulator''' was created by section 11 of the Compensation Act 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/29 | title=Compensation Act 2006 | publisher=Legislation.gov.uk | accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The post of Regulator is occupied by the [[Secretary of State for Justice]] to authorise and regulate claims management companies and:&lt;ref&gt;[[Compensation Act 2006]], [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/ukpga_20060029_en_2#pt2-l1g5 s.11]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Set and monitor standards of competence and [[legal ethics|professional conduct]];
*Promote good practice, in particular as to the provision of information about charges and other matters to users;
*Promote practices likely to facilitate [[competition (economics)|competition]];
*Ensure that arrangements are made for the protection of users, including complaints handling.

A person may [[appeal]] a decision of the Regulator about authorisation to the [[Claims Management Services Tribunal]] and there is a further route of appeal to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]].&lt;ref name="s13"&gt;[[Compensation Act 2006]], [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/ukpga_20060029_en_2#pt2-l1g13 s.13]&lt;/ref&gt;

When section 161 of the [[Legal Services Act 2007]] comes into force, '''claims management services''' and the '''Regulator''' will fall under the supervision of the [[Office for Legal Complaints]] and its ombudsman scheme.  It has been suggested that the first complaints will not be handled until 2010.&lt;ref name="gibb"&gt;{{cite news | author=Gibb, F. | title =Who will police the lawyers now?

==Claims Management Services Tribunal==
The '''Claims Management Services Tribunal''' was created by section 12 of the Compensation Act 2006 to hear:&lt;ref name="s13"/&gt;
*appeals from persons against a decision of the Regulator about authorisation; and
*after section 13(2) of the 2006 Act comes into force, references from the Claims Management Services Regulator in respect of complaints or questions about the professional conduct of a claims management company.

In January 2010 the Tribunal was abolished and its functions transferred to the [[First-tier Tribunal]].

[[Image:Newfoundlandcodfishing.jpg|thumb|right|Cod fishing on the Newfoundland Banks]]
'''Cod fishing in Newfoundland''' was carried out at a [[subsistence]] level for centuries, but large scale fishing began shortly after the [[European colonization of the Americas|European discovery of the North American continent]] in 1492, with the waters being found to be [[preternaturally]] plentiful, and ended after intense [[overfishing]] with the collapse of the fisheries in 1992.

==Native Canadian fishing==
The [[Beothuk]] (called [[Skraelings]] by the [[Vikings]]) were the native people of Newfoundland, and survived on a diet of caribou, marine mammals and fish. With the arrival of British and French coastal settlements, the Beothuk were forced inland, and the lack of their normal food source contributed to a decrease in the Beothuk population. Beothuk numbers began to dwindle rapidly due to a combination of factors directly relating to European, Inuit and Mi'kmaq migration, and by the 19th Century, the tribe no longer existed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/aboriginal/beothuk-disappearance.php Disappearance of the Beothuk] ''Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage''. Accessed 19 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigorrin.org/beothuk_kids.htm|title=Facts for kids:Beothuk Indians|publisher=Native Languages of the Americas|accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==15th and 16th centuries==
After his voyage in 1497, [[John Cabot]]'s crew reported that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;the sea there is full of fish that can be taken not only with nets but with fishing-baskets.&lt;ref name="ccc"&gt;{{cite web|

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and around 1600 English fishing captains still reported cod shoals 

&lt;blockquote&gt;so thick by the shore that we hardly have been able to row a boat through them.&lt;ref name="emagazine"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the early sixteenth century, fishermen from England, France, Spain and Portugal discovered the best places to fish for [[Atlantic cod|cod]] in the waters off [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], and how best to [[Fish preservation|preserve]] the fish for the journey home.&lt;ref name="Ryan1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdli.ca/cod/history5.htm |title=History of Newfoundland Cod Fishery |publisher= |accessdate=2008-06-20 |last=Ryan |first=Shannon |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218165112/http://www.cdli.ca/cod/history5.htm |archivedate=December 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French, Spanish and Portuguese fishermen tended to fish on the [[Grand Banks]] and other banks out to sea, where fish were always available. They [[Salting (food)|salted]] their fish on board ship and it was not [[Drying (food)|dried]] until brought to Europe. The English fishermen, however, concentrated on fishing inshore where the fish were only to be found at certain times of the year, during their [[Fish migration|migration]]s. These fishermen used small boats and returned to shore every day. They developed a system of light salting, washing and drying onshore which became very popular because the fish could remain edible for years.&lt;ref name="ccc"/&gt; Many of their coastal sites gradually developed into settlements, notably [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]],&lt;ref name="Ryan1"/&gt; now the provincial capital.

In the late sixteenth century the Spanish and Portuguese [[Fishery|fisheries]] were terminated, mainly as a result of the failure of the [[Spanish Armada]],&lt;ref name="ccc"/&gt; and thereafter the English and French shared the fishery every summer until 1904 when the French agreed to relinquish it to the Newfoundland residents.&lt;ref name="Ryan1"/&gt;
&lt;!-- What happened thereafter? More research needed. --&gt;

==20th century fishing methods and the fishery collapse==

In 1951 [[factory ship|factory fishing]] began with new super-trawlers such as the 'Fairtry'; 280 feet long and 2,600 gross tons.&lt;ref name="emagazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emagazine.com/archive/507|title=A Run on the Banks How "Factory Fishing" Decimated Newfoundland Cod|date=March 2001|publisher=E/The Environmental Magazine!|accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cod catch peaked in 1968 at 810,000 tons, approximately three times more than the maximum yearly catch achieved before the super-trawlers. Approximately 8 million tons of cod were caught between 1647 and 1750, a period encompassing 25 to 40 cod generations. The factory trawlers took the same amount in 15 years.&lt;ref name=myers&gt;{{cite journal|author1=RA Myers |author2=JA Hutchings |author3=NJ Barrowman |year=1997 |title=WHY DO FISH STOCKS COLLAPSE?

After a 10-year moratorium on fishing begun in 1992, the cod had still not returned.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;  It was thought that the local ecosystem might have changed, one possibility being that greater numbers of [[capelin]], which used to provide food for the cod, might be eating the juvenile cod.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The waters appeared to be dominated by crab and shrimp rather than fish.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2580733.stm|title=Cod's warning from Newfoundland|last=Hirsch|first=Tim|date=2002-12-16|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2011 it became apparent that the fisheries were returning to their original abundance, just more slowly than had been anticipated.&lt;ref name=New_Scientist&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20735-canadian-cod-make-a-comeback.html#.Uq7QzOXQRvE|title=Cod make a comeback|last=Coghlan|first=Andy|date=2011-07-28|publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frank | first1 = KT | last2 = Petrie | first2 = B | last3 = Fisher | first3 = JA | last4 = Leggett | first4 = WC | year = 2011 | title = Transient dynamics of an altered large marine ecosystem | url = http://www.environmentportal.in/files/file/marine%20ecosystem.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature | volume = 477 | issue = 7362| pages = 86–89 | doi = 10.1038/nature10285 | pmid=21796120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement==

The ''Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement'' (CETA) between Canada and the European Union is a [[Free Trade Agreement]] which is still under negotiation as of May 2015.&lt;ref name=gm15&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/newfoundland-and-labrador-says-talks-at-stalemate-with-ottawa-over-fish-fund/article24616519/ G+M: "Newfoundland and Labrador says talks at stalemate with Ottawa over fish fund"], 26 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The provincial government has argued that the Federal government of Canada in Ottawa reneged on a deal to pay $280 million in exchange for its relinquishment of minimum processing requirements as part of CETA.  Those rules helped protect jobs in fish plants, especially in rural areas hit hard by the [[Collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery|cod moratorium since 1992]].&lt;ref name=gm15/&gt;

[[File:Pylyp-orlyk-constitution-1710.jpg|thumb|250px|The first page of the Bendery Constitution. This copy is written in Latin and probably penned by Hetman Pylyp Orlyk. The original is kept in the [[National Archives of Sweden]].]]
The '''Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk''' ({{lang-uk|Конституція Пилипа Орлика}} (''Konstytutsiya Pylypa Orlyka'') or '''Pacts and Constitutions of Rights and Freedoms of the Zaporizhian Host'''  {{lang-uk|Пакти і Конституції прав і вольностей Війська Запорозького}} (''Pakty i Konstytutsii Prav i Volnostei Viyska Zaporozkoho''), {{lang-la|Pacta et Constitutiones Legum Libertatumque Exercitus Zaporoviensis}}) was a 1710 [[constitution]]al document written by [[Hetman]] [[Pylyp Orlyk]], a [[Cossack]] of [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/63202/ "300th anniversary of first Ukrainian constitution written by Pylyp Orlyk being celebrated"], ''[[Kyiv Post]]'', (April 5, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it is called the '''Bendery Constitution'''.

It established a democratic standard for the [[separation of powers]] in government between the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches, well before the publication of [[Montesquieu]]'s [[The Spirit of the Laws|''Spirit of the Laws'']].  The Constitution limited the executive authority of the [[hetman]], and established a democratically elected [[Cossack]] parliament called the General Council. Pylyp Orlyk's Constitution was unique for its historic period, and was one of the first state constitutions in Europe.

== History ==
[[Image:Mazepa2.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Charles XII]] and [[Mazepa]] at the [[Dnieper River]]]]
After the [[Battle of Poltava]], when [[Charles XII of Sweden]]'s and [[Hetman]] [[Ivan Mazepa]]'s armies were defeated by [[Peter I of Russia]], Pylyp Orlyk remained with Mazepa. Together, Orlyk, Mazepa, and their Cossack forces retreated to the city of [[Bender, Moldova|Bendery]], in Bessarabia (now [[Moldova]], then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]). The Zaporizhian Cossack Army also settled in this area.

When Mazepa died on 5 April 1710, Pylyp Orlyk was elected as the Hetman of the [[Zaporizhian Host]]. On the same day, he issued the ''Pacts and Constitutions of Rights and Freedoms of the Zaporizhian Host.'' Hence, Orlyk's Constitution is sometimes referred to by the city of its proclamation, Bendery.

===Preamble===
The preamble briefly discusses Cossack history, their [[Khazar]] origin, the rise of the [[Zaporizhian Sich]] and its downfall when after under [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] it [[Chmielnicki Uprising|rebelled against]] the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and ended up serving [[Imperial Russia]]. According to the introduction, using all available means, [[Moscow]] limited and nullified rights and freedoms of the [[Zaporizhian Host]] and eventually subjugated the free Cossack nation. [[Ivan Mazepa|Ivan Mazepa's]] politics and alliance with [[Charles XII of Sweden]] are explained as logical and inevitable, mandated by the need to free the homeland.  The independence of the new state from Russia is given as the primary goal of the Bendery Constitution.

===Articles 1 - 5===
'''Articles 1-3''' dealt with general Ukrainian affairs. They proclaimed the Orthodox faith to be the faith of Ukraine, and independent of the patriarch of Moscow.  The [[Sluch River (Ukraine)|Sluch River]] was designated as the boundary between [[Ukraine]] and [[Poland]].  The articles also recognized the need for an anti-Russian alliance between Ukraine and the [[Crimean Khanate]].

'''Articles 4-5''' reflected the interests of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], who constituted the overwhelming majority of the Bendery emigration. The Hetman was obligated:[[Image:Pylyp Orlyk.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Hetman]] [[Pylyp Orlyk]]]] 
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;to expel, with the help of Charles XII, the Russians from Zaporozhian territories&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;to grant the town of Trakhtymyriv to the Zaporozhians to serve as a hospital, and&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;to keep non-Zaporozhians away from Zaporozhian territories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===Articles 6 - 16===
'''Articles 6-10''' limited the powers of the hetman and established a Cossack parliament, similar to an extended council of officers, which was to meet three times a year. The General Council was to consist not only of the general staff and the regimental colonels, but also of "an outstanding and worthy individual from each regiment."

'''Articles 11-16''' protected the rights of towns, limited the taxation of peasants and poor Cossacks, and restricted the innkeepers.  [[Charles XII]], king of Sweden and "the protector of Ukraine," happened to be in Bendery at the time, and confirmed these articles.

== Memory ==
[[File:Bender Fortress. SE corner 02.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The monument in Bender Fortress]]
On 9 April 2010, the 300th anniversary of the creation of the Constitution, a monument was dedicated in Bender. The monument is in the form of a book with engraved information about the history of the writing of the Constitution and its full name in Ukrainian and Latin.

On [[Constitution Day (Ukraine)|Constitution Day]] 2018 [[Ukrainian President]] [[Petro Poroshenko]] remarked that the 1710 Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk is the predecessor of [[constitution of Ukraine|Ukraine's current constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/514896.html Ukraine's leaders congratulate Ukrainians on Constitution Day], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (28 June 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atrocities==
The Polish side claimed that during the Soviet retreat from [[Berdychiv]], [[Kiev]] and [[Zhytomyr]] mass hostage-taking of civilians occurred, with hostages forced to go with the Red Army all the way to the rear of the front.&lt;ref name=Melt&gt;{{cite book | author=Мельтюхов, Михаил Иванович ([[Mikhail Meltyukhov]])| title=Советско-польские войны.

In January 1918 in Cichinicze near [[Mohylow]] Bolsheviks shot patients and personnel of a Polish hospital.&lt;ref name="Dob"&gt;Janina Kurowska.

There were also accusations against [[Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz]], a former officer of the [[Imperial Russia]]n and Bolsheviks armies, who switched sides in the conflict and became a general in Poland. Although Bułak-Bałachowicz was regarded as a national hero to [[Belarusians]] in Poland for protecting them against Bolshevik terror, and his refusal to kill peasants on orders from Soviets,&lt;ref name="DB"&gt;[http://www.bialorus.pl/index.php?pokaz=polscy_bialorusini&amp;&amp;Rozdzial=polscy_bialorusini&amp;&amp;wiecej=8229 Dzień Bohaterów na Białostocczyźnie], Aleksy Moroz, 2004.

===Pogroms===
In 1919, Russian Jews were caught in the middle of a civil war, and became the victims of warring Red and White Russian, Ukrainian and Polish forces, among others, resulting in the loss of an estimated 100,000 Jewish lives.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Contemporary Jewry, Jonathan Frankel et al., eds.

[[Isaac Babel]], a war correspondent embedded with the [[Red Army]], in his 1920 diary wrote down many first-hand accounts of atrocities committed by both sides against Jews.&lt;ref name=Babel&gt;Isaac Babel, ''1920 Diary'', Yale, 2002, {{ISBN|0-300-09313-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 April 1919 in [[Pinsk]], a Polish officer, after hearing reports that Jewish inhabitants of the city were preparing to riot, panicked and ordered the execution of thirty-five Jews ([[Pinsk massacre]]).&lt;ref name="Michlic"&gt;[[Joanna Beata Michlic]], ''Poland's Threatening Other: The Image of the Jew from 1880 to the Present'', University of Nebraska Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8032-3240-3}} [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0803232403&amp;id=t6h2pI7o_zQC&amp;pg=RA4-PA118&amp;lpg=RA4-PA118&amp;ots=xijChxBTMJ&amp;dq=Lida+Dabrowski&amp;sig=NczNKzboFjdGBDwgLWoJ0lGALHk Google Print, p.118]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar hostilities, resulting in fewer casualties, took place in other towns. In Lida soldiers stopped several elderly Jews and cut off their beards with sabres and knives.&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt; During the pillage of Lida, Jewish homes were looted and 30 Jews were killed. Violence against Jews caused a major uproar and condemnation in the [[Parliament of Poland|Polish Parliament]]. [[Ignacy Daszyński]], leader of the [[Polish Socialist Party]] called all soldiers that committed acts of violence against the Jewish population "hooligans in uniform".&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt; However, Minister of War General [[Józef Leśniewski]], in his written reply to the speaker of Parliament, defended anti-Jewish violence by Polish units in Lida, referring to Jews as a Communist-minded community and stating that the Polish Army had the right to kill their adversaries.&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt;

However, reports of these incidents caused the United States to send a commission led by [[Henry Morgenthau, Sr.]] and Sir [[Stuart M. Samuel]] to investigate. According to [[Morgenthau Report|the findings]] of this Anglo-American Investigating Commission, a total of about 300 Jews lost their lives in all incidents involving Poles. The commission also found that the Polish military and civil authorities did their best to prevent such incidents and their recurrence in the future. The Morgenthau report stated that some forms of discrimination against Jews was of political rather than anti-Semitic nature and specifically avoided use of the term "pogrom," noting that the term was used to apply to a wide range of excesses, and had no specific definition.&lt;ref&gt;Andrzej Kapiszewski, [http://www.studiajudaica.pl/sj14kapi.pdf Controversial Reports on the  Situation of the Jews in Poland in the Aftermath of World War ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006100322/http://www.studiajudaica.pl/sj14kapi.pdf |date=2007-10-06 }} ''Studia Judaica'' 7: 2004 nr 2(14) s. 257–304 (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Tadeusz Piotrowski (sociologist)|Tadeusz Piotrowski]] noted that the Morgenthau Report admitted that the word "pogrom" was inapplicable to the conditions existing within a war zone. [[Richard C. Lukas]] argues that in some places, Jews had made themselves vulnerable by collaborating with Poland's Lithuanian and Soviet enemies.&lt;ref name="Piotrowski-41-42"/&gt;

==Property destruction==
Both sides in the conflict raised complaints about property destruction in diplomatic notes addressed to the [[Triple Entente|Entente]]. One note raised by the Soviet side stated that during the Soviet advance the retreating Poles engaged in "vengeful vandalism", as in [[Borisov (Belarus)|Borisov]] where the Poles, following their retreat, shelled the city with artillery from the opposite bank of the [[Berezina River]] "killing hundreds of people and leaving thousands without shelter."&lt;ref name="Melt"/&gt;

Another joint diplomatic note issued by Soviet Ukraine and Soviet Russia to the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] blamed the Poles for heavily damaging Kiev, including its civilian and art objects, such as [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]],&lt;ref name="Melt"/&gt; a charge the Poles denied, admitting only to the destruction of the [[Kiev bridges]],&lt;ref name="bridges"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.ukraine-observer.com/articles/193/324 | title= Fording the Dnipro.

Around the same time, two days after breaking through the Polish front line – [[Budyonny]]'s 1st Army destroyed the bridges in [[Zhytomyr]], wrecked the railway station and burned various buildings;&lt;ref name="Davies_WERS-123-124pl"&gt;Davies, ''White Eagle...'', Polish edition, pp. 123-124&lt;/ref&gt; Budyonny's troops would continue to spread terror and wreck infrastructure over the coming month in western Ukraine and eastern Poland, to delay the Polish army and disrupt its logistics.&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;Richard Watt, 1979.

'''Selling counterfeit illegal drugs''' is a crime in many [[U.S. state]]s' legal codes and in the federal law of the [[United States]]. It is also illegal to sell counterfeit drugs in the [[United Kingdom]]. The fake drugs are sometimes termed as imitation controlled substances.&lt;ref name="MCL"/&gt;

==Types of counterfeited illicit drugs==
{{See also|Counterfeit medications#Illicit drugs}}

Some fake drugs consist of substances from relatively harmless sources, such as grocery store goods like [[flour]], [[oregano]] or allergy pills. Even despite the substances' harmlessness, legal penalties for the crime of selling them can include time in jail.&lt;ref name="CDLBMA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCL"/&gt;

Certain fake drugs include other controlled drugs, or they may include synthetic drugs with similar properties. Uncertainty of an identity of the substance may increase the risk of an [[overdose]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

A related, yet distinct, problem is the trade of [[counterfeit medications]] with pills including substances such as [[fentanyl]] which can be used [[recreational drug use|recreationally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearhealth.com/articles/2017/04/26/does_crime_pay_when_it_comes_to_fake_drugs__110566.html|title=Does Crime Pay When It Comes to Fake Drugs? - RealClearHealth|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safemedicines.org/2016/08/dea-considers-fentanyl-containing-counterfeit-medications-a-global-threat.html|title=DEA Considers Fentanyl-Containing Counterfeit Medications a Global Threat – Partnership for Safe Medicines|website=www.safemedicines.org|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to drug-related crimes==
{{Further|Drug-related crime}}

There is a low chance of law punishing [[fraud]] among illicit drug traders, however it is likely that [[Social control#Informal|informal social control]] among drug traders reduces the likelihood of fraud between illegal trade partners. For instance, getting robbed or losing a business contact may not justify dealer's increased profits for a short-term from fraudulent behavior.&lt;ref name="LeclercWortley2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benoit Leclerc|author2=Richard Wortley|title=Cognition and Crime: Offender Decision Making and Script Analyses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wVltAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133|date=15 August 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-18535-9|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Federal Law===

Selling counterfeit illicit drugs is illegal under the U.S. federal law.&lt;ref name="CDLBMA"/&gt; Relevant parts of the U.S. federal law include 21 U.S.C. Section 331 and 18 U.S. Code § 1001.&lt;ref name="CDLBMA"/&gt;

The '''Dollar Sweets dispute''' in 1985 was a small [[industrial dispute]] with major legal ramifications in [[industrial relations]] where an employer resorted to a [[common law]] verdict and damages in a case in the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]] to resolve a dispute after industrial courts proved ineffective. It was the first time a [[trade union]] was forced to pay common law damages to an employer for losses suffered through [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]] in [[Australia]]. The dispute was also significant for boosting the career of the barrister representing the company, [[Peter Costello]], leading him to stand for federal Parliament and become Treasurer in the Howard Government.

==Background==
Dollar Sweets was a confectionery company in the Melbourne suburb of [[Malvern, Victoria|Malvern]] employing 27 people on a 38-hour week basis. The award for the industry specified a 40-hour week. The Hawke Government and the [[ACTU]] had entered into a [[Prices and Incomes Accord|wages accord]] which provided employer superannuation, reduced taxation and other social gains in return for unions agreeing to not pursue excessive wage claims. At the same time, centralised wage fixing was introduced in September 1983 where indexed wage rises were automatically granted to those workers whose unions undertook to abide by the Arbitration Commission's principles.

Several small unions, including the [[Federated Confectioners Association of Australia]], refused to join the accord.

The company owner, Fred Stauder, proposed an agreement with his employees in November 1983, that if they agreed to abide by the principles of the Arbitration Commission, the company would pay them the prescribed increases. All 27 employees agreed to the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Costello ''[http://www.hrnicholls.com.au/archives/vol5/vol5-5.php In Search of the Magic Pudding: The Dollar Sweets Story] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719125131/http://www.hrnicholls.com.au/archives/vol5/vol5-5.php |date=19 July 2008 }}'' Published by the [[H.R. Nicholls Society]], Accessed 6 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==The dispute==
In July 1985, the Federated Confectioners Association started a campaign with employers for a 36-hour week. Although this breached Arbitration Commission wage-fixing principles, the union had never agreed to accept those principles. When the union demanded negotiations with Stauder on a 36-hour week, Stauder told the union he could not afford to reduce hours and offered to show his accounts to the union. A reduction in hours would have also broken the 1983 agreement Stauder had reached with his employees.

Stauder offered his 27 employees that if they wished to continue to receive over-award pay for a (below-award) 38-hour week, they could do so if they signed a no-strike agreement; but, if they wanted to work a 36-hour week, they would have to find it elsewhere. Twelve employees accepted Stauder's offer, whereas the other 15 refused to sign the no-strike agreement and were subsequently sacked by the company, with the company employing another 15 workers in their place on existing conditions.&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;{{cite web |author=Peterson, Eric |url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/interventions/law.htm |title=The legal antecedents of the Workplace Relations Act- From the Plague to Reith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223091515/http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/interventions/law.htm |archive-date=23 December 2007 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July 1985, a picket line was established by the sacked workers outside the Dollar Sweets factory. The picket line remained for 143 days, with the company refusing to reinstate the workers.

By October 1985, the company was still refusing to reinstate the sacked workers but through the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission had provided "an offer to assist in finding alternate employment within the industry and also to supply references to those people." Commissioner Bain recommended "that those who have been picketing should accept the employer's offer and cease their picketing forthwith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|AIRC|403|1985|litigants=Dollar Sweets Pty Ltd and The Federated Confectioners Association of Australia |courtname=[[Australian Industrial Relations Commission]] |date=22 October 1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of bomb and arson threats were made against Dollar Sweets and one strike-breaking driver was assaulted and his truck vandalised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The End of Certainty: Power, Politics, and Business in Australia| first=Paul| last=Kelly|date=December 1994| publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EKXBgmYeO2QC&amp;pg=PA258&amp;lpg=PA258&amp;dq=%22dollar+sweets%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=kTLtdiqPEK&amp;sig=02uiXgzRUAyzTRjgfdVybLsZMGk#PPA258,M1| isbn=978-1-86373-757-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, phone and telex lines were cut to the factory with telecom workers refusing to cross the picket line to repair the services.&lt;ref name="SMH 26 Jul 06"/&gt;

Dollar Sweets received strong support and assistance from [[Richard Mulcahy (Australian politician)|Richard Mulcahy]], chief executive officer of the [[Confectionery Manufacturers of Australia]]. By December 1985, it was decided to seek an injunction under common law against the union in the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]], with solicitor [[Michael Kroger]] engaging [[Alan Goldberg (judge)|Alan Goldberg]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|QC}} to lead junior barrister and future federal Treasurer [[Peter Costello]] to represent the company. The case was financed by the [[Victorian Chamber of Commerce]].&lt;ref name="SMH 26 Jul 06"/&gt;

The company alleged union interference with contractual relations, intimidation,  nuisance, and a conspiracy to injure the plaintiff and sought an injunction and punitive damages. Victorian Supreme Court Justice Peter Murphy gave judgement, issued restraining orders on 12 December with the picket ending the next day. In his judgement, Murphy described the picketing as "stupid and nihilistic." He ruled that this was not a "lawful form of picketing, but a... nuisance involving obstruction, harassment, and besetting". It was beside the point that there were specialist courts for industrial disputes. "This court is not without power ... and should intervene". He issued an interlocutory injunction against the picket,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicRp|38|1986|litigants=Dollar Sweets Pty Ltd v Federated Confectioners Association of Australia |parallelcite=[1986] [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 383 |date=12 December 1985 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of Victoria|Supreme Court]] (Vic)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The common law damages claim was settled in April 1988, when the union paid the sum of $175,000 to Dollar Sweets as compensation for the losses it suffered as a result of the picket.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SMH 26 Jul 06"&gt;{{cite News |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/the-sweets-of-a-famous-victory/2006/07/25/1153816182414.html |title=The sweets of a famous victory |newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=26 July 2006 |access-date=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

Fred Stauder sold Dollar Sweets Holding Limited in 1999, which is now called [[Snack Foods Limited]].

Peter Costello described the case as "''It came to be bracketed with the [[Mudginberri dispute|Mudginberri Abattoir case]] as a great victory against militant unionism''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite News|author=Peter Costello |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/freds-place-in-political-history/2006/07/25/1153816182417.html?page=fullpage |title=Fred's place in political history |newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=26 July 2006 |access-date=6 August 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Doug Cameron (politician)|Doug Cameron]], the secretary of the [[Australian Manufacturing Workers Union]], with which the Federated Confectioners Association amalgamated, saw the dispute as a turning point. "''It was when the social contract between workers, business and the government started to collapse,''" and "''It became a cause celebre for the big end of town and lawyers started to realise they could make money ripping off the pay and conditions of workers.''"&lt;ref name="SMH 26 Jul 06"/&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3607">The '''Dublin Statement on Water and Sustainable Development''', also known as the '''Dublin Principles''', was a meeting of experts on water related problems that took place on 31 January 1992 at the International Conference on Water and the Environment (ICWE), Dublin, Ireland, organised on 26–31 January 1992.

The Dublin Statement on Water and Sustainable Development recognises the increasing [[water scarcity|scarcity of water]] as a result of the different conflicting uses and overuses of water.

== The Dublin Principles ==

The declaration sets out recommendations for action at local, national and international levels to reduce the scarcity, through the following four guiding principles:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wmo.ch/pages/prog/hwrp/documents/english/icwedece.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://docs.watsan.net/Scanned_PDF_Files/Class_Code_7_Conference/71-ICWE92-9739.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Fresh water]] is a [[finite resource|finite and vulnerable resource]], essential to sustain life, development and the environment
#[[Water development]] and [[water management|management]] should be based on a participatory approach, involving users, planners and policy-makers at all levels
#[[Women]] play a central part in the provision, management and safeguarding of water
#Water has an [[economic value]] in all its competing uses and should be recognized as an [[economic good]]

== Water as a human right or economic good? ==

The emphasis of the Dublin Statement on ''the economic value'' of water rather than water as ''a [[universal right]]'' is highly contested by [[NGO]]s and human rights activists (although the full text of principle 4 does state ''it is vital to recognize first the basic right of all human beings to have access to clean water and [[sanitation]] at an affordable price'')

In November 2002, however, the UN [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] adopted ''General Comment No. 15'', which was formulated by experts as a comment on articles 11 and 12 of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatercouncil.org/index.php?id%3D1764 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717002357/http://www.worldwatercouncil.org/index.php?id=1764 |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this comment, water is recognised not only as a limited natural resource and a public good but also as a [[human right]]. This step - adopting General Comment No. 15 - was seen as a decisive step towards the recognition of water as universal right.

On 30 September 2010, the 15th Session of the UN Human Rights Council passed Resolution A/HRC/15/L.14,&lt;ref&gt;http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/15/L.14&lt;/ref&gt; reaffirming an earlier General Assembly resolution (64/292 of 28 July 2010) which ''recognized the right to safe and clean [[drinking water]] and sanitation as a human right that is essential for the full enjoyment of life and all human rights''. Resolution A/HRC/15/L.14 clarifies that ''the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation is derived from the [[right to an adequate standard of living]] and inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of [[physical health|physical]] and [[mental health]], as well as the right to life and [[human dignity]]''.

{{Politics of the European Union}}

The '''European Union Customs Union''' ('''EUCU''') is a [[customs union]] which consists of all the [[Member state of the European Union|member states of the European Union]] (EU), [[Monaco]], and some dependencies of the United Kingdom which are not part of the EU ([[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]], a [[British Overseas Territory]]; and the British [[Crown dependencies]]: [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]], [[Bailiwick of Jersey]], and the [[Isle of Man]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/common/faq/customs/faq_1178_en.htm FAQ: Customs, Taxation and Customs Union], European Commission. Retrieved 20 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Some territories within the EU do not participate in the customs union, usually as a result of their geographic distance. Besides the EUCU, the EU, through separate agreements, is in customs unions with [[Andorra]], [[San Marino]], and [[Turkey]], with the exceptions of certain goods.&lt;ref name=CT&amp;U&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/customs_duties/rules_origin/customs_unions/index_en.htm Customs unions, Taxation and Customs Union], European Commission. Retrieved 20 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The customs union is a principal component of the [[European Economic Community]], established in 1958, and now succeeded by the [[European Union]]. No customs duties are levied on goods travelling within the customs union and – unlike a [[free trade area]] – members of the customs union impose a [[common external tariff]] on all goods entering the union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erskine|first=Daniel H|date=2006|title=The United States-EC Dispute Over Customs Matters: Trade Facilitation, Customs Unions, and the Meaning of WTO Obligations|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=987367|journal=Florida Journal of International Law|language=en|volume=18|pages=432-485|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A precondition of the customs union is that the [[European Commission]] negotiates for and on behalf of the Union as a whole in international trade deals such as the [[World Trade Organization]], rather than each member state negotiating individually.

== Non-EU participants ==
Monaco and the British dependencies of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey are integral parts of the EU's customs territory.&lt;ref name=CT&amp;U /&gt;

== EU territories with an opt-out ==
While all EU member states are part of the customs union, not all of their respective territories participate. Territories of member states which have remained outside of the EU ([[overseas countries and territories of the European Union]]) generally do not participate in the customs union.

However, there are seven territories that are within the EU which do not participate in the customs union:{{why|date=December 2018}}

== Union Customs Code ==
{{Main|Union Customs Code}}
The [[Union Customs Code]] (UCC), intended to modernise customs procedures, entered into force on 1 May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/customs_code/union_customs_code/ucc/index_en.htm|title=Union Customs Code – Taxation and customs union – European Commission|website=Taxation and customs union}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation will take place over a period of time and full implementation is anticipated by 31 December 2020 at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/union-customs-code/ucc-introduction_en UCC: an Introduction], accessed 29 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission has stated that the aims of the UCC are simplicity, service and speed.

== Common external tariffs ==
The EU Customs Union sets the tariff rates for imports to the EU from other countries. These rates are detailed and depend on the specific type of product imported, and can also vary by the time of year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://circabc.europa.eu/faces/jsp/extension/wai/navigation/container.jsp Taric and Quota Data &amp; Information] {{snd}} [[European Commission]] Communication and Information Resource Centre for Administrations, Businesses and Citizens.&lt;/ref&gt; The full [[WTO]] [[Most Favoured Nation]] tariff rates apply only to those countries that do not have a [[European Union free trade agreements|Free Trade Agreement with the EU]], or are not on a WTO recognised exemption scheme such as [[Everything but Arms]] (an EU support arrangement for [[Least Developed Countries]]).

'''The Federal Bar Council''' is a not-for-profit specialty Bar association whose membership consists of [[lawyer]]s and judges who practice primarily in federal courts within the [[Second Circuit]]. The Second Circuit covers the following districts:
District of Connecticut, Eastern District of New York, Northern District of New York, Southern District of New York, Western District of New York and District of Vermont. The Federal Bar Council's offices are in White Plains, New York.

The organization was created as a separate organization by act of the [[New York State Legislature]], effective April 1932, under the name "the Federal Bar Association of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut."  It adopted its current, shorter name in 1968.

A '''fine on alienation''' (see [[Alienation (property law)]]), in [[feudal law]], was a sum of money paid to the lord by a tenant when he had occasion to make over his land to another.  It is similar in nature to a '''[[Feudal relief|relief]]''', a payment made by an heir to the lord to receive his inheritance.

The '''Football Spectators Act 1989''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] enacted during the premiership of [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Its provisions apply primarily to [[Soccer|football]] (soccer) matches played in [[England]] and [[Wales]]. Amendments to the act were made through the [[Football (Offences and Disorder) Act 1999]], the [[Football (Disorder) Act 2000]], and the [[Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006]], the last of which repealed large sections of the Football Spectators Act 1989.

The aim of the Act was to identify individuals known to cause disorder at and around football matches, whether in the UK itself or abroad.&lt;ref name="FBOsInBrief"&gt;{{cite web |title=Football banning orders |url=https://www.inbrief.co.uk/football-law/football-banning-orders/ |website=In Brief |publisher=[[Claims.co.uk Ltd]] |accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally intended that fans would have to give a passport number to become part of a membership scheme and receive an identity card so as to go to away matches, but eventually this was not enacted.

==Football-related offenses==
The Act and its amendments identifies a number of specific offenses related to fan behavior, including the throwing of objects onto the field or into the crowd; racist or obscene chanting at a match; violence against persons or property, including threats and endangerment of any person's life; a variety of alcohol-related offenses; and the bringing or being in possession of fireworks into or at a designated sporting event.&lt;ref name="FBOsInBrief"/&gt; However, almost any criminal offence connected with a game that occurs within 24 hours on either end of a football match can also be designated as a football-related offense.&lt;ref name="FBOsInBrief"/&gt;

The Act also introduced the '''football banning order''' (FBO), under which a magistrate can ban an individual from attending football matches (whether either domestic or foreign) for a period of 2-10 years and can also impose additional restrictions.&lt;ref name="FBOsInBrief"/&gt; FBOs are usually imposed by the court after someone has been convicted of a football-related offense, although they can be imposed even on individuals charged but acquitted of such offenses, or in response to police representations that the FBO would prevent football-related violence or disorder.&lt;ref name="FBOsInBrief"/&gt;

The '''Forum for International Conciliation and Arbitration (FICA)''' is a non-governmental organisation providing arbitration, dispute-resolution and dispute-avoidance services, founded by [[Ben Beaumont]].

The first operation was initiated by ITC which recommended FICA to work with the Law Association of Zambia to create a new Arbitration Act, enacted in 2002,  and train potential Arbitrators during 1996/1997 with funding provided by Chemonics and USAID.

Ben Beaumont was co-opted into the Expert Group of Working Group VI Secured Transactions assisting with the Draft Legislative Guide to the Model Law of Secured Transactions 2005-07.

In 2002 FICA was invited with Observer status to attend [[UNCITRAL]] and is accredited to the [[WTO]] in 1999 and [[International Trade Centre]] (ITC) in 1998.

'''Hedonology''' (Hedonics), is the study of the impact an injury or incident had on a persons lifestyle.

== History ==
The Hedonology Institute was developed by [[Jeffrey Francis Magrowski]], Ph.D., CRC, CRE. A trademark for Hedonology was registered in 1990 and abandoned in 1999 while Magrowski attended college and his studies in Vocational Rehabilitation.

The development and use of Hedonics admissibility of scientific evidence for use in the legal system is set by the standard of [[Hedonic damages]] to evaluate non-economic damages using the American Juris Jurisprudence method (1988), based on the [[Frye Standard]] and supported by the [[Daubert Test]]. The determination of present and future pain and suffering is taken into account. Generally, the fact that statistics can be used, but must get the same result was proven in the use of Hedonics.

The Hedonics model and analysis was first accepted in 1991 in United States Claims Court: Joshua Wasson V. Secretary of the Dept. of Health and Human Services, No. 90-208V.  The second case accepting Hedonics in the legal system was in Gary D. Wyatt, Sr. V. The United States of America (Veteran's Administration) 4:94CV1567-DJS September 23, 1996.

An Economist, [[Stan V. Smith, Ph.D. (economist) |Stan V. Smith]], developed a theory of economic damages (as opposed to non-pecuniary, or non-economic damages) for Hedonic Damages based on the value of a human life by statistical analysis, which has not met the Frye or Daubert Test under admissibility in a court of law in several states.

{{Hillary Clinton series}}
During her [[Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State|her tenure as United States Secretary of State]], [[Hillary Clinton]] drew controversy by using her family's private [[email server]] for official communications rather than using official [[United States Department of State|State Department]] email accounts maintained on secure federal servers. An [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] examination of Clinton's server found over 100 emails containing classified information, including 65 emails deemed "Secret" and 22 deemed "Top Secret", none with classification markings. An additional 2,093 emails not marked classified were retroactively classified by the State Department. 

Some experts, officials, and members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] contended that Clinton's use of a private [[Message transfer agent|messaging system]] and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, as well as federal laws and regulations governing [[recordkeeping]]. Clinton responded that her use complied with federal laws and State Department regulations, and that former secretaries of state had also maintained personal email accounts. News reports indicated that the emails discussed "innocuous" matters already available in the public domain. For example, the [[Drone strikes in Pakistan|CIA drone program]] has been widely discussed in the public domain since the early 2000s; however, the very existence of the program is technically classified, so even sharing a newspaper article that mentions it would constitute a security breach as far as the CIA is concerned.&lt;ref&gt;"Secrecy defines Obama’s drone war," ''Washington Post'', December 19, 2011: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/secrecy-defines-obamas-drone-war/2011/10/28/gIQAPKNR5O_story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"DoD Warns Employees of Classified Info in Public Domain," Federation of American Scientists, June 11, 2013: https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2013/06/dod-classified/&lt;/ref&gt;  

The controversy was a major point of discussion during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], in which Clinton was the Democratic nominee. In May, the [[Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State|State Department's Office of the Inspector General]] released a report about the State Department's email practices, including Clinton's. In July, FBI director [[James Comey]] announced that the FBI investigation had concluded that Clinton had been "extremely careless" but recommended that no charges be filed. Clinton's opponent, presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]], used the nickname "Crooked Hillary" to criticize Clinton primarily for the email controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/01/05/trumps-nicknames-for-rivals-from-rocket-man-to-pocahontas.html|title=Trump's nicknames for rivals, from 'Rocket Man' to 'Pocahontas'|first=Kaitlyn|last=Schallhorn|date=April 17, 2018|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump supporters adopted the chant "lock her up" to imply Clinton had committed a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/22/a-brief-history-of-the-lock-her-up-chant-as-it-looks-like-trump-might-not-even-try/|title=A brief history of the 'Lock her up!' chant by Trump supporters against Clinton|last=Stevenson|first=Peter|date=November 22, 2016|publisher=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2016, days before the election, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had started looking into newly discovered emails. On November 6, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had not changed its original conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2016/11/06/fbi-not-recommending-charges-over-new-clinton-emails/93395808/|work=USA Today|title=FBI declares it is finally done investigating Hillary Clinton's email|authors=Schouten, Fredreka, Kevin Johnson &amp; Heidi Przybyla|date=November 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comey's timing was contentious, with critics saying that he had violated Department of Justice guidelines and precedent and prejudiced the public against Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/james-comey-fbi-clinton-230851|title=Will Comey survive the Clinton email flap?|work=Politico|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy received more media coverage than any other topic during the presidential campaign.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cjr.org/analysis/fake-news-media-election-trump.php|title=Don't blame the election on fake news.

===Initial awareness===
As early as 2009, officials with the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA) expressed concerns over possible violations of normal federal government record-keeping procedures at the State Department under then-Secretary Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gerstein|first=Josh|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/state-department-email-rule-hillary-clinton-115804.html?hp=t4_r|title=Clinton private email violated 'clear-cut' State Dept. rules|publisher=Politico.com|date=March 6, 2015|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, near the end of Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, a nonprofit group called [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]], or CREW, filed a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] request seeking records about her email. CREW received a response in May 2013: "no records responsive to your request were located."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;O'Harrow Jr., Robert.

Blumenthal did not have a security clearance when he received material from Clinton that has since been characterized as classified by the State Department.&lt;ref&gt;Gerstein, Josh. [http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/hillary-clinton-sidney-blumenthal-emails-benghazi-hearings-215083 "Clinton's emails from Blumenthal spark tension"], [[Politico]] (October 22, 2015): "At least one [email] has been deemed classified by State, including information Clinton sent to Blumenthal, who had no security clearance."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Micah.

Most of Clinton's reply to Blumenthal is redacted as classified."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2014, lawyers from the State Department noticed a number of emails from Clinton's personal account, while reviewing documents requested by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.  A request by the State Department for additional emails led to negotiations with her lawyers and advisors. In October, the State Department sent letters to Clinton and all previous Secretaries of State back to [[Madeleine Albright]] requesting emails and documents related to their work while in office. On December 5, 2014, Clinton lawyers delivered 12 file boxes filled with printed paper containing more than 30,000 emails. Clinton withheld almost 32,000 emails deemed to be of a personal nature.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; Datto, Inc., which provided [[data backup]] service for Clinton's email, agreed to give the FBI the hardware that stored the backups.&lt;ref name=WP10715&gt;{{cite news|author1=Tom Hamburger  |author2=Rosalind S.

==Use of private server for government business==
According to Clinton's spokesperson Nick Merrill, a number of government officials have used private email accounts for official business, including secretaries of state before Clinton.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-hillary-clinton-emails-20150303-story.html|title=Hillary Clinton's use of private email not unusual, but still raises questions|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 3, 2015|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State Department spokesperson [[Marie Harf]] said that: "For some historical context, Secretary [[John Kerry|Kerry]] is the first secretary of state to rely primarily on a state.gov email account."&lt;ref name="MontanaroFactCheck"&gt;Domenico Montanaro, [https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/04/02/396823014/fact-check-hillary-clinton-those-emails-and-the-law Fact Check: Hillary Clinton, Those Emails and the Law], NPR (April 2, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; John Wonderlich, a transparency advocate with the [[Sunlight Foundation]], observed while many government officials used private email accounts, their use of private email servers was much rarer.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|title = Howard Dean: 'Tremendous' number of public officials have done what Hillary Clinton did with email|url = http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/18/howard-dean/howard-dean-tremendous-number-public-officials-hav/|website = @politifact|access-date = February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Metcalfe, a former head of the Justice Department's Office of Information and Privacy, said this gave her even tighter control over her emails by not involving a third party such as Google and helped prevent their disclosure by Congressional subpoena. He added: "She managed successfully to insulate her official emails, categorically, from the FOIA, both during her tenure at State and long after her departure from it—perhaps forever," making it "a blatant circumvention of the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] by someone who unquestionably knows better."&lt;ref name="MontanaroFactCheck" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Hillary's Email Defense Is Laughable|url = http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/03/hillary-clinton-email-scandal-defense-laughable-foia-116116|website = Politico.com|access-date = February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Harf, use by government officials of personal email for government business is permissible under the [[Federal Records Act]], so long as relevant official communications, including all work-related emails, are preserved by the agency. The Act (which was [[Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014|amended in late 2014]] after Clinton left office to require that personal emails be transferred to government servers within 20 days) requires agencies to retain all official communications, including all work-related emails, and stipulates that government employees cannot destroy or remove relevant records.&lt;ref name="MontanaroFactCheck"/&gt; NARA regulations dictate how records should be created and maintained, require that they must be maintained "by the agency" and "readily found," and that the records must "make possible a proper scrutiny by the Congress."&lt;ref name="MontanaroFactCheck"/&gt; Section 1924 of [[Title 18 of the United States Code]] addresses the deletion and retention of classified documents, under which "knowingly" removing or housing classified information at an "unauthorized location" is subject to a fine, or up to a year in prison.&lt;ref name="MontanaroFactCheck"/&gt;

Experts such as Metcalfe agree that these practices are allowed by federal law assuming that the material is not supposed to be classified,&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Bob Cusack  |author2=Molly K. Hooper|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/237012-the-backer-who-could-hurt-hillary|title=The Hillary backer who will pose problems for her 2016 bid|newspaper=The Hill|date=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or at least these practices are allowed in case of emergencies,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; but they discourage these practices, believing that official email accounts should be used.&lt;ref name="MontanaroFactCheck"/&gt;

Jason R. Baron, the former head of [[litigation]] at NARA, described the practice as "highly unusual" but not a violation of the law. In a separate interview, he said, "It is very difficult to conceive of a scenario—short of nuclear winter—where an agency would be justified in allowing its cabinet-level head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merica, Dan.[https://twitter.com/danmericaCNN/status/572842630855430145 Report via CNN Tweet (March 3, 2015), "Jason Baron, former head of litigation at the NARA, says Clinton didn't 'violate' the law.

Inspector General Linick wrote that he "found no evidence that staff in the Office of the Legal Adviser reviewed or approved Secretary Clinton's personal system," and also found that multiple State employees who raised concerns regarding Clinton's server were told that the Office of the Legal Adviser had approved it, and were further told to "never speak of the Secretary's personal email system again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/5/25/11771850/hillary-clinton-emails-inspector-general-report|title=What the new inspector general report on Hillary Clinton's emails actually says|author=Andrew Prokop|date=May 25, 2016|work=Vox}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/26/opinions/clinton-email-server-ig-report-opinion-cox/|title=Hillary Clinton's shrinking email defense|author=Douglas Cox|date=May 26, 2016|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/state-department-hillary-clinton-violated-record-keeping-rules|title=State Department Inspector General Finds Hillary Clinton Violated Recordkeeping Rules|work=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/us/politics/state-department-hillary-clinton-emails.html|title=Hillary Clinton Is Criticized for Private Emails in State Dept.

===Hacking attempts===
Clinton's server was configured to allow users to connect openly from the Internet and control it remotely using Microsoft's [[Remote Desktop Services]].&lt;ref name=AP1013&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jack Gillum  |author2=Stephen Braun|title=Exclusive: Clinton server's software had hacking risk|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/467ff78858bf4dde8db21677deeff101/only-ap-clinton-server-ran-software-risked-hacking|accessdate=October 13, 2015|agency=Associated Press|date=October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known that hackers were aware of Clinton's non-public email address as early as 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-hackers-tried-to-infiltrate-hillary-clintons-emails/ "Hackers linked to Russia tried to infiltrate Hillary Clinton's emails"], [[CBS News]] (September 30, 2015): "these messages show hackers had Clinton's email address, which was not public. ...

In 2012, according to server records, a hacker in [[Serbia]] scanned Clinton's Chappaqua server at least twice, in August and in December 2012. It was unclear whether the hacker knew the server belonged to Clinton, although it did identify itself as providing email services for clintonemail.com.&lt;ref name=AP1013/&gt; During 2014, Clinton's server was the target of repeated intrusions originating in Germany, China, and South Korea. Threat monitoring software on the server blocked at least five such attempts.

According to security researchers at [[Secureworks]] the email leak was caused by Threat Group-4127 (TG-4127), a unit that targets governments, military, and international non-governmental organizations. The researchers report moderate confidence that the unit gathers intelligence on behalf of the Russian government.&lt;ref name="secureworks.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-4127-targets-hillary-clinton-presidential-campaign|title=Hillary Clinton Email Targeted by Threat Group-4127|publisher=secureworks.com|access-date=2017-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720175418/https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-4127-targets-hillary-clinton-presidential-campaign#|archive-date=July 20, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deletion of emails==

In 2014, months prior to public knowledge of the server's existence, Clinton chief of staff [[Cheryl Mills]] and two attorneys worked to identify work-related emails on the server to be archived and preserved for the State Department. Upon completion of this task in December 2014, Mills instructed Clinton's computer services provider, Platte River Networks (PRN), to change the server's [[retention period]] to 60 days, allowing 31,830 older personal emails to be automatically deleted from the server, as Clinton had decided she no longer needed them. However, the PRN technician assigned for this task failed to carry it out at that time.&lt;ref name="factcheck.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.factcheck.org/2016/09/the-fbi-files-on-clintons-emails/|title=The FBI Files on Clinton's Emails - FactCheck.org|date=September 7, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the existence of the server became publicly known on March 2, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/us/politics/hillary-clintons-use-of-private-email-at-state-department-raises-flags.html|title=Hillary Clinton Used Personal Email Account at State Dept., Possibly Breaking Rules|publisher=|accessdate=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Select Committee on Benghazi]] issued a subpoena for Benghazi-related emails two days later. Mills sent an email to PRN on March 9 mentioning the Committee's retention request.&lt;ref name="factcheck.org"/&gt; The PRN technician then had what he described to the FBI as an "oh shit moment," realizing he had not set the personal emails to be deleted as instructed months earlier. The technician then erased the emails using a free utility, [[BleachBit]], sometime between March 25 and March 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/us/politics/hillary-clinton-fbi.html|title=F.B.I.

Since this episode, Clinton critics have accused her or her aides of deleting emails that were under subpoena, alleging the server had been "bleached" or "acid-washed" by a "very expensive" process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.factcheck.org/2016/09/trump-pence-acid-wash-facts/|title=Trump, Pence 'Acid Wash' Facts - FactCheck.org|date=September 8, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to destroy evidence, with candidate Donald Trump stating the day before the 2016 election that "Hillary Clinton erased more than 30,000 emails as part of a cover-up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://factba.se/search#30,000+emails|title=Donald Trump Complete - Search Tweets, Speeches, Policies - Factbase|first=|last=Factbase|website=Factbase|accessdate=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump continued with this narrative as late as August 2018, asking "Look at the crimes that Clinton did with the emails and she deletes 33,000 emails after she gets a subpoena from Congress, and this Justice Department does nothing about it?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://factba.se/search#emails|title=Donald Trump Complete - Search Tweets, Speeches, Policies - Factbase|first=|last=Factbase|website=Factbase|accessdate=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classified information in emails==
In various interviews, Clinton has said that "I did not send classified material, and I did not receive any material that was marked or designated classified."&lt;ref name=Allen0821 /&gt; However, in June and July 2016, a number of news outlets reported that Clinton's emails did include messages with some paragraphs marked with a "(c)" for "Confidential."&lt;ref name="BBC20160705"&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff|title=FBI recommends no charges against Hillary Clinton over emails|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36711711|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=July 5, 2016|accessdate=November 14, 2016|quote=But investigators found that a number of messages that were marked classified at the time were sent from her account.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FoxNews2016-06-11"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herridge|first1=Catherine|last2=Browne|first2=Pamela K.|date=June 11, 2016|title=Despite Clinton claims, 2012 email had classified marking|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/06/11/despite-clinton-claims-2012-email-had-classified-marking.html|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]|accessdate=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy]], stated that they had confirmed that several of the emails contained classified information that was not marked as classified, at least one of which was publicly released.&lt;ref name=CNN3/&gt;

On July 24, 2015, Linick and McCullough said they had discovered classified information on Clinton's email account,&lt;ref name=NYT72415&gt;{{cite news|author1=Michael S.

In a separate statement in the form of a letter to Congress, McCullough said that he had made a request to the State Department for access to the entire set of emails turned over by Clinton, but that the Department rejected his request.&lt;ref name=NYT72415/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ3&gt;Byron Tau, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/investigation-sought-into-hillary-clintons-emails-1437714369 Hillary Clinton Sent Classified Information Over Email While at State Department], ''The Wall Street Journal'', July 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter stated that none of the emails were marked as classified, but because they included classified information they should have been marked and handled as such, and transmitted securely.&lt;ref name=WSJ3/&gt;

On August 10, 2015, the IC inspector general said that two of the 40 emails in the sample were  "Top Secret/[[Sensitive Compartmented Information]]" and subsequently given classified labels of "TK" (for "Talent Keyhole," indicating material obtained by aerial or space-based imagery sources and [[NOFORN]]).&lt;ref name=AP81415 /&gt; One is a discussion of a news article about a [[Drone strikes in Pakistan|U.S. drone strike operation]].&lt;ref name=AP81415/&gt; The second, he said, either referred to classified material or else was "parallel reporting" of [[open-source intelligence]], which might still be classified by the government "owning agency" that sourced the information by secret means even though the same information was also available in the public domain.&lt;ref name=AP81415/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=US State Department 'Top secret' emails on Clinton server discussed drone program, reference classified info.|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/14/top-secret-emails-on-clinton-server-discussed-drone-program-may-reference/?intcmp=ob_article_footer_text&amp;intcmp=obinsite|accessdate=August 24, 2015|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/06/us/politics/agencies-battle-over-what-is-top-secret-in-hillary-clintons-emails.html|title=Agencies Battle Over What Is 'Top Secret' in Hillary Clinton's Emails|date=February 5, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=April 21, 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton's presidential campaign and the State Department disputed the letter, and questioned whether the emails had been over-classified by an arbitrary process. According to an unnamed source, a secondary review by the CIA and the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] endorsed the earlier inspectors general findings concluding that the emails (one of which concerned North Korea's nuclear weapons program) were "Top Secret" when received by Clinton through her private server in 2009 and 2011, a conclusion also disputed by the Clinton campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Michael S.

The IC inspector general issued another letter to Congress on January 14, 2016. In this letter he stated that an unnamed intelligence agency had made a sworn declaration that "several dozen emails [had been] determined by the IC element to be at the CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, and TOP SECRET/[[Special access program|SAP]] levels." Other intelligence officials added that the several dozen were not the two emails from the previous sample and that the clearance of the IC inspector general himself had to be upgraded before he could learn about the programs referenced by the emails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Hillary Clinton Email Said to Include Material Exceeding 'Top Secret'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/us/politics/hillary-clinton-email-said-to-include-material-exceeding-top-secret.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 19, 2016|accessdate=January 20, 2016|issn=0362-4331|first=Mark|last=Mazzetti}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hillary Clinton Emails Held Info Beyond Top Secret: IG|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hillary-clinton-emails-contained-info-above-top-secret-ig-n499886|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Intelligence community watchdog reconfirms that dozens of Clinton emails were classified|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/19/intelligence-community-watchdog-reconfirms-that-dozens-of-clinton-emails-were-classified|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 19, 2016|accessdate=January 20, 2016|issn=0190-8286|first=Rosalind S.|last=Helderman|first2=Tom|last2=Hamburger}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC News reported on January 20, 2016 that senior American officials described these emails as "innocuous" because—although they discussed the CIA drone program that is technically classified TOP SECRET/[[Special access program|SAP]]—the existence of the CIA drone program had been widely known and discussed in the public domain for years.

On January 29, 2016, the State Department announced that 22 documents from Clinton's email server would not be released because they contained highly classified information that was too sensitive for public consumption. At the same time, the State Department announced that it was initiating its own investigation into whether the server contained information that was classified at the time it was sent or received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Byron Tau|title=State Department: 22 of Hillary Clinton's Emails Considered Too Classified to Release|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-department-says-22-of-clintons-emails-contain-highly-classified-information-1454101286|accessdate=February 1, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====July 2015 – Security referral====
The State Department and [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]] (IC) inspector generals' discovery of four emails containing classified information, out of a random sample of 40, prompted them to make a security referral to the  FBI's counterintelligence office, to alert authorities that classified information was being kept on Clinton's server and by her lawyer on a [[USB flash drive|thumb drive]].&lt;ref name=NYT72415 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ3/&gt; As part of an FBI probe at the request of the IC [[inspector general]], Clinton agreed to turn over her email server to the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], as well as thumb drives containing copies of her work-related emails. Other emails were obtained by the [[United States House Select Committee on Benghazi]] from other sources, in connection with the committee's inquiry. Clinton's own emails are being made public in stages by the State Department on a gradual schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House GOP split over Clinton email probe|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/hillary-clinton-emails-republicans-server-congress-215498|publisher=Politico|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/tracking-the-clinton-controversies-from-whitewater-to-benghazi/396182|title=From Whitewater to Benghazi: A Clinton-Scandal Primer|work=David A.

In a letter describing the matter to Senator [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]], Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, Clinton's lawyer [[David E. Kendall]] said that emails, and all other data stored on the server, had earlier been erased prior to the device being turned over to the authorities, and that both he and another lawyer had been given security clearances by the State Department to handle thumb drives containing about 30,000 emails that Clinton subsequently also turned over to authorities.

In late June 2016, it was reported that Bill Clinton met privately with Attorney General [[Loretta Lynch]] on her private plane on the tarmac at [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport]]. Officials indicated that the 30 minute meeting took place when Clinton became aware that Lynch's plane was on the same tarmac at the airport.  When the meeting became public, Lynch stated that it was "primarily social" and "there was no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body." Lynch was criticized for her involvement in the meeting and was called on by some critics to recuse herself from involvement in the FBI's investigation of the email case. In response, she stated "The F.B.I. is investigating whether Mrs. Clinton, her aides or anyone else broke the law by setting up a private email server for her to use as secretary of state," but "the case will be resolved by the same team that has been working on it from the beginning" and "I will be accepting their recommendations."&lt;ref name="https"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/us/politics/loretta-lynch-hillary-clinton-email-server.html|title=Lynch to Accept F.B.I.

With regard to mishandling of classified information, Comey said, "there is evidence that they [Clinton and her team] were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." The investigation found 110 emails that should have been regarded as classified at the time they were sent; another 2,000 emails were retroactively classified which means they were not classified at the time they were sent.&lt;ref name="Comey"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/watch-live-fbi-director-speaks-at-11-a-m-edt|title=FBI director recommends 'no charges' over Clinton's emails|last=Epatko|first=Larisa|date=July 5, 2016|work=PBS|accessdate=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comey said that "any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding ... should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation."&lt;ref name="FBI-Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vault.fbi.gov/hillary-r.-clinton|title=Clinton e-mail Investigation|publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]|date=July 2016|accessdate=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/05/politics/fbi-director-doesnt-recommend-charges-against-hillary-clinton/index.html|title=FBI: Clinton 'extremely careless' but no charges recommended|first=Collinson, Stephen &amp; Tal Kopan|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI learned that Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. The FBI did not find "direct evidence that Secretary Clinton's personal e-mail domain ... was successfully hacked;" they assessed it "possible that hostile actors gained access" to it.&lt;ref name=Comey/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZapHel/&gt; Investigators found that State Department employees often used private emails to conduct business. Comey noted, "We also developed evidence that the security culture of the State Department in general, and with respect to use of unclassified e-mail systems in particular, was generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information found elsewhere in the government."&lt;ref name="Graff"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/hillary-clinton-emails-2016-server-state-department-fbi-214307|title=What the FBI Files Reveal About Hillary Clinton's Email Server|last=Graff|first=Garrett M.|date=September 30, 2016|work=Politico|accessdate=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 6, 2016, Lynch confirmed that the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of private email servers while secretary of state would be closed without criminal charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-closes-clinton-email-probe-without-charges/2016/07/06/0ad8feda-43c2-11e6-88d0-6adee48be8bc_story.html|last=Zapotosky|first=Matt|title=Justice Department closes Clinton email probe without charges|work=The Washington Post|date=July 6, 2016|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====October 2016 – Additional investigation====
In early October 2016, FBI criminal investigators working on a case involving former Congressman [[Anthony Weiner]] allegedly [[Anthony Weiner sexting scandals|sending sexually explicit texts to a fifteen-year-old girl]] discovered emails from Weiner's estranged wife, [[Huma Abedin]], vice chair of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, that they considered potentially relevant to the Clinton server investigation. FBI officials reportedly decided to disclose the development despite its potential effect on the pending presidential election to preempt the possibility that it would be leaked in another way.&lt;ref name="CNN Weiner"&gt;{{cite web|last=Perez|first=Evan|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/30/politics/clinton-emails-fbi-abedin/index.html|title=FBI discovered Clinton-related emails weeks ago|date=October 30, 2016|publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2016, Comey informed Congress that "in connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation." He said the FBI will take "appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation." He added that the FBI "cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/28/politics/fbi-reviewing-new-emails-in-clinton-probe-director-tells-senate-judiciary-committee/|title=Comey notified Congress of email probe despite DOJ concerns|last1=Perez|first1=Evan|last2=Brown|first2=Pamela|date=October 29, 2016|publisher=CNN|accessdate=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI obtained a new search warrant to allow them to review Abedin's emails.&lt;ref name="CNN Weiner"/&gt;

Comey informed Congress of this additional investigation despite having been advised by Justice Department officials that such an announcement would violate department policies and procedures, including a policy not to comment on investigations close to an election.&lt;ref name="despite"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/28/politics/fbi-reviewing-new-emails-in-clinton-probe-director-tells-senate-judiciary-committee/|title=Comey notified Congress of email probe despite DOJ concerns|date=October 30, 2016|publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comey later explained, in a letter to FBI employees, "We don't ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed." Law enforcement sources added that he feared he would be accused of concealing relevant information if he did not disclose it.&lt;ref name="despite"/&gt;

News of this renewed investigation being revealed shortly before the [[United States presidential election, 2016|U.S. presidential election]] led to the announcement being described as an "[[October surprise]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/furor-over-fbi-email-bombshell/3572062.html|title=Officials: FBI Knew About Possible New Clinton Emails Weeks Before Friday Announcement|last=Bowman|first=Michael|newspaper=VOA|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prompted statements from both the Democratic and Republican campaigns. [[Donald Trump]] repeated his characterization that Hillary Clinton's email usage as secretary of state was "worse than [[Watergate]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/4534375/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-emails-watergate/|title=Donald Trump: Hillary Clinton Email Scandal 'Worse Than Watergate'|work=Time|date=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/fbi-clinton-new-probe-trump-hails-230460|title=Trump hails new Clinton FBI review as 'bigger than Watergate'|last=Schreckinger|first=Ben|date=October 28, 2016|work=Politico|accessdate=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton called for the FBI to immediately release all information about the newly discovered emails and said she was confident the FBI would not change its earlier conclusion that there is no basis for criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/28/fbi-probe-newly-discovered-hillary-clinton-emails-and-reopen-inv|title=Hillary Clinton demands answers and Democrats call foul as FBI reopens investigation over files found on sexting congressman's computer|date=October 30, 2016|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D-CA) said she was "shocked" by the letter, saying it "played right into the political campaign of Donald Trump."&lt;ref name="despite"/&gt;

On November 6, in another letter to Congress, Comey stated that, after working "around the clock" to review all of the newly discovered emails, the FBI had not changed the conclusion it reached in July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/fbi-completes-review-newly-revealed-hillary-clinton-emails-finds-no-n678701|title=FBI finds no criminality in review of newly discovered Clinton emails|accessdate=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/us/politics/hilary-clinton-male-voters-donald-trump.html|title=Emails Warrant No New Action Against Hillary Clinton, F.B.I.

On November 12, during a conference call to top donors, Hillary Clinton attributed her [[United States presidential election, 2016|presidential election]] loss to Comey's announcements, saying they stopped her momentum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lawler |first=David |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/12/hillary-clinton-blames-election-loss-on-fbis-james-comey-in-call/ |title=US election: Hillary Clinton blames loss on FBI's James Comey in call with top donors |date=November 13, 2016 |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=January 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, the US Justice Department started an investigation of Comey's announcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ainsley |first1=Julia Edwards |last2=Harte |first2=Julia |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-clinton-idUSKBN14W2NT |title=FBI investigated over pre-election decisions on Clinton email |date=January 13, 2017 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=January 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Senate probes Loretta Lynch interference ===
According to Comey's June 8, 2017, testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch had asked him to downplay the investigation into Clinton's emails by calling it a "matter" rather than an investigation. He said the request "confused and concerned" him. He added that Lynch's tarmac meeting with [[Bill Clinton]] also influenced his decision to publicly announce the results of the FBI probe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/james-comey-loretta-lynch-told-me-not-to-call-clinton-email-probe-an-investigation/article/2625335|title=James Comey: Loretta Lynch told me not to call Clinton email probe an 'investigation'|last=Cohen|first=Kelly|work=Washington Examiner|access-date=2017-07-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-probes-loretta-lynchs-alleged-interference-clinton-email/story?id=48237960|title=Senate probes Loretta Lynch's alleged interference in Clinton investigation|last=News|first=A.

On July 7, 2016, the internal State Department resumed its review of whether classified information had been mishandled.

=== Department of Justice Inspector General's report ===

{{main|Inspector General report on FBI and DOJ actions in the 2016 election}}

The [[Inspector General of the Department of Justice]] (IG) launched an investigation into how the DOJ and FBI had handled the investigation into Clinton's email. On June 14, 2018, the IG issued a report that was highly critical of Comey's actions.&lt;ref name = highlights/&gt; Regarding his July press conference, in which he criticized Clinton even while announcing the investigation was over, the IG said it was "extraordinary and insubordinate for Comey to conceal his intentions (about the press conference) from his superiors," and that "we found none of his reasons to be a persuasive basis for deviating from well-established Department policies."&lt;ref name = slams&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doj-watchdog-slams-insubordinate-james-comey-over-clinton-email_us_5b22a82be4b0d4fc01fc61e6|title=DOJ Watchdog Slams 'Insubordinate' James Comey Over Clinton Email News Conference|last=Reilly|first=Ryan J.|date=June 14, 2018|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comey's October decision to send a letter notifying Congress that the investigation had been re-opened one week before the election was described as "[[ad-hoc]]" and "a serious error in judgment."&lt;ref name = slams/&gt;   However, the IG concluded that prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton case were consistent with precedent and were not affected by bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/14/politics/ig-report-clinton-email-investigation/index.html|title=Comey's actions 'extraordinary and insubordinate,' report says|date=June 14, 2018|work=CNN|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opinions of journalists and experts===
According to the ''New York Times'', if Clinton was a recipient of classified emails, "it is not clear that she would have known that they contained government secrets, since they were not marked classified."&lt;ref name=Allen0821&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1= Jonathan|title=Exclusive: Dozens of Clinton emails were classified from the start, U.S. rules suggest|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/21/us-usa-election-clinton-emails-idUSKCN0QQ0BW20150821|agency=Reuters|accessdate=August 28, 2015|date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT72415/&gt; The newspaper reported that "most specialists believe the occasional appearance of classified information in the Clinton account was probably of marginal consequence".&lt;ref name=NYT8815/&gt; Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the [[Federation of American Scientists]], said that inadvertent "spillage" of classified information into an unclassified realm is a common occurrence.&lt;ref name="NYT8815"/&gt;

[[Reuters]]' August 2015 review of a set of released emails found "at least 30 email threads from 2009, representing scores of individual emails," which include what the State Department identifies as "foreign government information," defined by the U.S. government as "any information, written or spoken, provided in confidence to U.S. officials by their foreign counterparts." Although unmarked, Reuters' examination appeared to suggest that these emails "were classified from the start."&lt;ref name=Allen0821/&gt; [[J. William Leonard]], a former director of the NARA [[Information Security Oversight Office]], said that such information is "born classified" and that "[I]f a foreign minister just told the secretary of state something in confidence, by U.S. rules that is classified at the moment it's in U.S. channels and U.S. possession."&lt;ref name=Allen0821/&gt; According to Reuters, the standard U.S. government [[nondisclosure agreement]] "warns people authorized to handle classified information that it may not be marked that way and that it may come in oral form." The State Department "disputed Reuters' analysis" but declined to elaborate.&lt;ref name=Allen0821/&gt;

The [[Associated Press]] reported, "Some officials said they believed the designations were a stretch—a knee-jerk move in a bureaucracy rife with over-classification."&lt;ref name=AP81415/&gt; [[Jeffrey Toobin]], in an August 2015 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article, wrote that the Clinton email affair is an illustration of overclassification, a problem written about by Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] in his book ''Secrecy: The American Experience''.&lt;ref name="Toobin"&gt;Jeffrey Toobin, [http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillarys-problem-the-government-classifies-everything Hillary's Problem: The Government Classifies Everything], ''The New Yorker'', August 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Toobin writes that "government bureaucracies use classification rules to protect turf, to avoid embarrassment, to embarrass rivals—in short, for a variety of motives that have little to do with national security."&lt;ref name="Toobin"/&gt; Toobin wrote that "It's not only the public who cannot know the extent or content of government secrecy. Realistically, government officials can't know either—and this is Hillary Clinton's problem. Toobin noted that "one of Clinton's potentially classified email exchanges is nothing more than a discussion of a newspaper story about [[Drone strikes in Pakistan|drones]]" and wrote: "That such a discussion could be classified underlines the absurdity of the current system. But that is the system that exists, and if and when the agencies determine that she sent or received classified information through her private server, Clinton will be accused of mishandling national-security secrets."&lt;ref name="Toobin"/&gt;

In an analysis of the Clinton email controversy published by the [[Brookings Institution]], Richard Lempert wrote that "security professionals have a reputation for erring in the direction of overclassification."&lt;ref name="German"&gt;German, Ben. [http://www.nationaljournal.com/twentysixteen/2015/08/19/other-top-secret-problem-hurting-hillary-clinton The Other 'Top Secret' Problem Hurting Hillary Clinton] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017184847/http://www.nationaljournal.com/twentysixteen/2015/08/19/other-top-secret-problem-hurting-hillary-clinton |date=October 17, 2015 }}, ''National Journal'', August 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the liberty and national security program at the [[Brennan Center for Justice]] at [[New York University School of Law]], says that "The odds are good that any classified information in the Clinton emails should not have been classified," since an estimated 50 percent to 90 percent of classified documents could be made public without risking national security.&lt;ref name="German" /&gt; Nate Jones, an expert with the [[National Security Archive]] at [[George Washington University]], said: "Clinton's mistreatment of federal records and the intelligence community's desire to retroactively overclassify are two distinct troubling problems. No politician is giving the right message: Blame Clinton for poor records practices, but don't embrace overclassification while you do it."&lt;ref name="German" /&gt;

==House Oversight Committee hearing==
On July 7, 2016, Comey was questioned for 5 hours by the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]].  Comey stated that there was "evidence of mishandling" of classified information and that he believed that Clinton was "extremely careless; I think she was negligent."

====Later responses====
Clinton's responses to the question, made during her presidential campaign, evolved over time.&lt;ref name="Toobin"/&gt;&lt;ref name=politics&gt;{{cite news|author1=Leonnig, Carol D., Karen Tumulty &amp; Rosalind S.

Later, after a government review discovered some of her emails contained classified information, she said she never sent or received information that was ''marked'' classified.&lt;ref name="Toobin" /&gt; Her campaign claimed other emails contained information that is now classified, but was ''retroactively'' classified by U.S. intelligence agencies after Clinton had received the material.&lt;ref name="Campaign Classified"&gt;Tau, Byron &amp; Robert McMillan.

In her first national interview about the 2016 presidential race, on July 7, 2015, Clinton was asked by [[CNN]]'s [[Brianna Keilar]] about her use of private email accounts while serving as Secretary of State. She said:

On September 9, 2015, Clinton apologized during an ABC News interview for using the private server, saying she was "sorry for that."&lt;ref name="abcsorry"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-private-email-mistake-im/story?id=33608970|title=Hillary Clinton on Private Email: 'That Was a Mistake.

Clinton and the State Department said the emails were not marked classified when sent. However, Clinton signed a [[non-disclosure agreement]] which stated that classified material may be "marked or unmarked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/27/opinions/cox-clinton-email-controversy|title=Hillary Clinton email controversy: How serious is it?|author=Douglas Cox|date=July 27, 2015|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/04/how-did-top-secret-emails-end-up-on-hillary-clintons-server|title=How did 'top secret' emails end up on Hillary Clinton's server?|author=Glenn Kessler|date=February 4, 2016|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/clinton-emails-held-indirect-references-undercover-cia-officers-n510741|title=Clinton Emails Held Indirect References to Undercover CIA Officers|author=Ken Dilanian|publisher=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the author of an email is legally required to properly mark it as classified if it contains classified material, and to avoid sending classified material on a personal device, such as the ones used exclusively by Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;Gearan, Anne.

Because the State Department deals in so many sensitive secrets, many employees use two computer networks for their daily communications: a non-classified system called the "low side" and a more secure classified system called the "high side." But Clinton had no official State Department e-mail address and exclusively used a personal domain and personal server set up in her home for electronic correspondence."&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton maintained that she did not send or receive any confidential emails from her personal server. In a Democratic debate with [[Bernie Sanders]] on February 4, 2016, Clinton said, "I never sent or received any classified material." In a Meet the Press interview on July 2, 2016, Clinton stated: "Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="politifact.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com1"/&gt;

In an interview with Fox News in late July 2016, Clinton stated "Director Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I've said is consistent with what I have told the American people, that there were decisions discussed and made to classify retroactively certain of the emails." The Washington Post awarded Clinton four "Pinocchios", its worst rating, for her statement saying "While Comey did say there was no evidence she lied to the FBI, that is not the same as saying she told the truth to the American public."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/07/31/clintons-claim-that-the-fbi-director-said-her-email-answers-were-truthful "Clinton’s claim that the [[FBI]] director at the time, James Comey, said that Clinton's email answers were ''truthful''"], ''The Washington Post'', July 31, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/01/politics/washington-post-clinton-four-pinnochios-comey-emails/index.html][[Washington Post]]&lt;span&gt; hits Clinton with four 'Pinnochios' on emails&lt;/span&gt;, CNN (August 1, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nation.foxnews.com/2016/08/01/wapo-gives-hillary-four-pinocchios-claiming-comey-called-her-truthful-about-her-emails "WaPo Gives Hillary Four Pinocchios For Claiming Comey Called Her ''Truthful'' About Her Emails"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819034501/http://nation.foxnews.com/2016/08/01/wapo-gives-hillary-four-pinocchios-claiming-comey-called-her-truthful-about-her-emails# |date=August 19, 2016 }}, Fox News Channel, August 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic response===
In August 2015, the ''New York Times'' reported on "interviews with more than 75 Democratic governors, lawmakers, candidates and party members" on the email issue.&lt;ref name="FrustratesDems"&gt;Patrick Healy, Jonathan Martin &amp; Maggie Haberman, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/28/us/politics/hillary-clintons-handling-of-email-issue-frustrates-democratic-leaders.html Hillary Clinton’s Handling of Email Issue Frustrates Democratic Leaders], ''The New York Times'', August 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' reported, "None of the Democrats interviewed went so far as to suggest that the email issue raised concerns about Mrs. Clinton's ability to serve as president, and many expressed a belief that it had been [[manufactured controversy|manufactured]] by Republicans in Congress and other adversaries."&lt;ref name="FrustratesDems"/&gt; At the same time, many Democratic leaders showed increasing frustration among party leaders of Clinton's handling of the email issue. For example, [[Edward G. Rendell]], former [[governor of Pennsylvania]], a Clinton supporter, said that a failure of the Clinton campaign to get ahead of the issue early on meant that the campaign was "left just playing defense."&lt;ref name="FrustratesDems"/&gt; Other prominent Democrats, such as Governor [[Dannel P. Malloy]] of [[Connecticut]], were less concerned, noting the campaign was at an early stage and that attacks on Clinton were to be expected.&lt;ref name="FrustratesDems"/&gt;

At the October 2015 primary debate, Clinton's chief rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] of [[Vermont]], defended Clinton, saying: "Let me say this. Let me say something that may not be great politics. But I think the secretary is right. And that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails!"&lt;ref name="DamnEmailsRoy"&gt;Roy, Jessica.

===Republican response===
[[Chairman of the Republican National Committee|Republican National Committee chairman]] [[Reince Priebus]] said, in a statement regarding the June 30, 2015 email releases, "These emails ... are just the tip of the iceberg, and we will never get full disclosure until Hillary Clinton releases her secret server for an independent investigation."&lt;ref name=LATimes2/&gt; [[Trey Gowdy]] said on June 29, 2015, that he would press the State Department for a fuller accounting of Clinton's emails, after the Benghazi panel retrieved 15 additional emails to Sidney Blumenthal that the department had not provided to the Committee.&lt;ref name=Memoli1&gt;Memoli, Michael A.

On September 12, 2015, Republican Senators [[Charles Grassley]] and [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]], chairmen of the Senate [[Senate Judiciary Committee|Judiciary]] and [[Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee|Homeland Security]] committees, respectively, said they would seek an independent review of the deleted emails, if they were recovered from Clinton's server, to determine if there were any government related items among those deleted.&lt;ref name=WP0912/&gt;

===Comparisons and media coverage===
Analyses by Columbia Journalism Review, the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society|Berkman Klein Center]] for Internet and Society at Harvard University, and the [[Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy|Shorenstein Center]] at the Harvard Kennedy School show that the Clinton email controversy received more coverage in mainstream media outlets than any other topic during the 2016 presidential election.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The ''New York Times'' coverage of the email controversy was notoriously extensive; according to a Columbia Journalism Review analysis, "''in just six days, ''The New York Times'' ran as many cover stories about Hillary Clinton's emails as they did about all policy issues combined in the 69 days leading up to the election'' (and that does not include the three additional articles on October 18, and November 6 and 7, or the two articles on the emails taken from John Podesta)."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In attempting to explain the lopsided coverage, the Columbia Journalism Review speculates, "In retrospect, it seems clear that the press in general made the mistake of assuming a Clinton victory was inevitable, and were setting themselves as credible critics of the next administration."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Pundit|Media commentators]] drew comparisons of Clinton's email usage to past political controversies. ''Pacific Standard Magazine'' published an article in May 2015, comparing email controversy and her response to it with the [[Whitewater controversy|Whitewater]] investigation 20 years earlier.&lt;ref name="PS031615"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gerth|first1=Jeff|title=Hillary Clinton's Email Scandal Looks a Lot Like the Whitewater Investigation of 20 Years Ago|url=https://psmag.com/news/hillary-clintons-email-scandal-looks-a-lot-like-the-whitewater-investigation-of-20-years-ago|accessdate=October 13, 2015|work=Pacific Standard|date=March 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, ''Washington Post'' associate editor and [[investigative journalist]] [[Bob Woodward]], when asked about Clinton's handling of her emails, said they remind him of the [[Nixon White House tapes|Nixon tapes]] from the [[Watergate scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/security-questions-linger-in-clinton-emails-508380739552 Security questions linger in Clinton emails], ''[[Morning Joe]]'', August 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 9, 2015, liberal columnist and Clinton supporter [[Dana Milbank]] wrote that the email affair was "a needless, self-inflicted wound" brought about by "debilitating caution" in "trying to make sure an embarrassing e-mail or two didn't become public," which led to "obsessive secrecy." Milbank pointed out that Clinton herself had justifiably criticized the George W. Bush administration in 2007 for its "secret" White House email accounts.&lt;ref name=CT3915&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milbank|first1=Dana|title=Hillary Clinton, too cautious for her own good|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clintons-debilitating-caution/2015/03/06/e3225638-c411-11e4-9ec2-b418f57a4a99_story.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=March 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GWBSalon&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boehlert|first1=Eric|title=The George W.

On ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'', [[political analyst]] [[Juan Williams]] contrasted the [[media coverage]] of Clinton's emails to the coverage of the 2007 [[Bush White House email controversy]] which he claimed received "just about zero press coverage."&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/15/juan-williams/media-reaction-george-w-bushs-email-controversy|title=The media reaction to George W.

Still, Williams has something of a point that compared to the extensive recent coverage of Clinton's use of private email, media coverage of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy was thin."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

On June 22, 2015, the Benghazi panel released emails between Clinton and [[Sidney Blumenthal]], who had been recently deposed by the committee.

The State Department confirmed that 10 emails and parts of five others from Sidney Blumenthal regarding Benghazi, which the Committee had made public on June 22, could not be located in the Department's records, but that the 46 other, previously unreleased Libya-related Blumenthal emails published by the Committee, were in the Department's records. In response, Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill, when asked about the discrepancy said: "She has turned over 55,000 pages of materials to the State Department, including all emails in her possession from Mr. Blumenthal."&lt;ref name=KlapperLee&gt;Bradley Klapper &amp; Matthew Lee, [http://www.aol.com/article/2015/06/25/state-dept-15-emails-missing-from-clinton-cache/21201434/ State Dept.: 15 emails missing from Clinton cache], Associated Press (June 25, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Republican Committee members were encouraged about their probe, having found emails that Clinton failed to produce.&lt;ref name=KlapperLee/&gt;&lt;ref name=NJ1&gt;{{cite news|author=Ben German|title=GOP's Benghazi Probe Ups Pressure on John Kerry as Team Clinton Returns Fire: Republican Rep.

''The New York Times'' reported that "the long day of often-testy exchanges between committee members and their prominent witness revealed little new information about an episode that has been the subject of seven previous investigations ... Perhaps stung by recent admissions that the pursuit of Mrs. Clinton's emails was politically motivated, Republican lawmakers on the panel for the most part avoided any mention of her use of a private email server."&lt;ref name="ShearSchmidt"/&gt; The email issue did arise shortly before lunch, in "a shouting match" between Republican committee chair [[Trey Gowdy]] and two Democrats, [[Adam Schiff]] and [[Elijah Cummings]].&lt;ref name="ShearSchmidt"/&gt; Late in the hearing, Republican Representative [[Jim Jordan (U.S. politician)|Jim Jordan]] of Ohio accused Clinton of changing her accounts of the email service, leading to a "heated exchange" in which Clinton said that she had erred in making a private email account, but denied having dealt with anything marked classified, instead seeking "to be transparent by publicly releasing her emails."&lt;ref name="ShearSchmidt"/&gt;

It was revealed in October 2017 that during the 2016 US Presidential election, Cambridge Analytica funder and GOP mega-donor [[Rebekah Mercer]] had proposed creating a searchable data base for Hillary Clinton emails in the public domain and then forwarded this suggestion to several people, including Cambridge Analytica CEO [[Alexander Nix]], who personally emailed a request to Julian Assange for Clinton's emails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/27/politics/rebekah-mercer-cambridge-analytica-clinton-emails/index.html|title=GOP megadonor requested Trump's data firm organize hacked Clinton emails|author=Dana Bash and Marshall Cohen|publisher=CNN|accessdate=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assange responded to the report by saying he denied Nix's request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/us/julian-assange-wikileaks-trump.html|title=Assange Says WikiLeaks Rejected Request by Data Firm Tied to Trump|first=Nicholas|last=Confessore|date=October 25, 2017|accessdate=April 21, 2018|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Associated Press v. U.S. Department of State''===
On March 11, 2015, the day after Clinton acknowledged her private email account, the Associated Press (AP) filed suit against the State Department regarding multiple FOIA requests over the past five years. The requests were for various emails and other documents from Clinton's time as secretary of state and were still unfulfilled at the time.&lt;ref name="APSuitFiled"&gt;Associated Press, [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/associated-press-sues-state-department-for-hillary-clinton-emails/ Associated Press sues State Department for Hillary Clinton emails], CBS News, March 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://cryptome.org/2015/03/ap-001.pdf Complaint], ''Associated Press v. U.S. Department of State'' (filed March 11, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leon Schedule"&gt;Eric Tucker, [http://bigstory.ap.org/article/17bb3935546b422ba4246e934e00d8d7/clinton-records-judge-sets-schedule-release-ap Clinton records: Judge sets schedule for release to AP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811004955/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/17bb3935546b422ba4246e934e00d8d7/clinton-records-judge-sets-schedule-release-ap |date=August 11, 2015 }}, Associated Press, August 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The State Department said that a high volume of FOIA requests and a large backlog had caused the delay.&lt;ref name="APSuitFiled"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerstein July 20 Hearing"&gt;Josh Gerstein, [http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2015/07/judge-slams-state-department-over-hillary-clintonrelated-210878.html Judge slams State Department over Hillary Clinton-related records], Politico.com, July 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 20, 2015, U.S. District Judge [[Richard J. Leon]] reacted angrily to what he said was "the State Department for four years dragging their feet."&lt;ref name="Gerstein July 20 Hearing"/&gt; Leon said that "even the least ambitious bureaucrat" could process the request faster than the State Department was doing.&lt;ref&gt;David Francis, [https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/07/30/judge-the-least-ambitious-bureaucrat-could-process-clintons-personal-emails-faster "Judge: The 'Least Ambitious' Bureaucrat Could Process Clinton's Personal Emails Faster"], ''Foreign Policy'', July 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 7, 2015, Leon issued an order setting a stringent schedule for the State Department to provide the AP with the requested documents over the next eight months.&lt;ref name="Leon Schedule"/&gt; The order issued by Leon did not include the 55,000 pages of Clinton emails the State Department scheduled to be released in the Leopold case, or take into account 20 boxes given to the State Department by [[Philippe Reines]], a former Clinton senior adviser.&lt;ref name="Leon Schedule"/&gt;

===Other suits and coordination of email cases===
In September 2015, the State Department filed a motion in court seeking to consolidate and coordinate the large number of Freedom of Information Act lawsuits relating to Clinton and Clinton-related emails. There were at the time at least three dozen lawsuits pending, before 17 different judges.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Gerstein, [http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2015/09/feds-move-to-consolidate-lawsuits-over-hillary-clinton-emails-213228 Feds move to consolidate lawsuits over Hillary Clinton emails], ''Politico'', September 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TauCoordination"&gt;Tau, Byron, [https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/10/08/court-declines-to-consolidate-clinton-emails-lawsuits/ Court Declines to Consolidate Clinton Emails Lawsuits], ''The Wall Street Journal'', October 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]] order issued on October 8, 2015, Chief U.S. District Judge [[Richard W. Roberts]] wrote that the cases did not meet the usual criteria for consolidation but: "The judges who have been randomly assigned to these cases have been and continue to be committed to informal coordination so as to avoid unnecessary inefficiencies and confusion, and the parties are also urged to meet and confer to assist in coordination."&lt;ref name="TauCoordination"/&gt;

In 2015, Judicial Watch and the Cause of Action Institute filed two lawsuits seeking a court order to compel the Department of State and the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] to recover emails from Clinton's server. In January 2016, these two suits (which were consolidated because they involved the same issues) were dismissed as [[Mootness|moot]] by U.S. District Judge [[James Boasberg]], because the government was already working to recover and preserve these emails.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigstory.ap.org/article/b219d2da39454b799b653187d6ab2831/judge-dismisses-pair-lawsuits-arising-clinton-emails Judge dismisses pair of lawsuits arising from Clinton emails] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404032537/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/b219d2da39454b799b653187d6ab2831/judge-dismisses-pair-lawsuits-arising-clinton-emails |date=April 4, 2016 }}, Associated Press, January 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, the [[Republican National Committee]] filed four new [[complaint (law)|complaints]] in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia stemming from Freedom of Information Act requests it had filed the previous year. These new filings brought the total number of civil suits over access to Clinton's records pending in federal court to at least 38.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2016-03-15/gop-files-more-lawsuits-seeking-hillary-clinton-records|title=GOP files a flurry of new lawsuits seeking reams of government documents related to Clinton's tenure as secretary of state|date=March 15, 2016|work=[[U.S. News and World Report]]|first1=Michael|last1=Biesecker|agency=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, in response to the Republican National Committee's complaints filed in March 2016, the State Department estimates it will take 75 years to complete the review of documents which are responsive to the complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/06/07/estimate-of-75-years-to-process-clinton-aides-email-not-an-outlandish-estimation|title=Estimate of 75 Years to Release Clinton Aides' Email 'Not an Outlandish Estimation'|last=Tau|first=Byron|website=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=July 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed that a delay of this nature would cause the documents to remain out of public view longer than the vast majority of classified documents which must be declassified after 25 years.&lt;ref name="NYT20061221"&gt;{{cite news|author=Scott Shane|title=U.S. to Declassify Secrets at Age 25|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/washington/21declassify.html|work=[[New York Times]]|date=December 21, 2006|accessdate=September 16, 2018|quote=Secret documents 25 years old or older will lose their classified status without so much as the stroke of a pen, unless agencies have sought exemptions on the ground that the material remains secret.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Human Rights Act 1998''' (c42) is an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom]] which received [[Royal Assent]] on 9 November 1998, and mostly came into force on 2 October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justice.org.uk/images/pdfs/HRAINT.PDF|title=A Guide to the Human Rights Act 1998: Questions and Answers|last=|first=|date=December 2000|website=|publisher=JUSTICE|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020312081934/http://www.justice.org.uk/images/pdfs/HRAINT.PDF|archive-date=12 March 2002|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim was to incorporate into UK law the rights contained in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The Act makes a remedy for breach of a Convention right available in UK courts, without the need to go to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) in [[Strasbourg]].

In particular, the Act makes it unlawful for any public body to act in a way which is incompatible with the Convention, unless the wording of any other [[primary legislation]] provides no other choice. It also requires the judiciary (including tribunals) to take account of any decisions, judgment or opinion of the European Court of Human Rights, and to interpret legislation, as far as possible, in a way which is compatible with Convention rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pattinson|first=Shaun D|date=2015-03-01|title=The Human Rights Act and the doctrine of precedent|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/lest.12049/abstract|journal=Legal Studies|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=142–164|doi=10.1111/lest.12049|issn=1748-121X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if it is not possible to interpret an Act of Parliament so as to make it compatible with the Convention, the judges are not allowed to override it. All they can do is issue a [[declaration of incompatibility]]. This declaration does not affect the validity of the Act of Parliament: in that way, the Human Rights Act seeks to maintain the principle of [[Parliamentary sovereignty]] (see: [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]]). However, judges may strike down [[secondary legislation]]. Under the Act, individuals retain the right to sue in the Strasbourg court. 

Former Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] criticised the Act from 2007 and proposed to replace it with a "[[Proposed British Bill of Rights|British Bill of Rights]]" during his [[Second Cameron ministry|second ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/magna-carta-and-contemporary-constitutional-change|title=Magna Carta and contemporary constitutional change|last=Blick|first=Andrew|date=13 March 2015|website=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|access-date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--first two paragraphs have no citations--&gt;
The Convention was drafted by the [[Council of Europe]] after [[World War II]]. [[Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe]] was the Chair of the Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions of the Council's Consultative Assembly from 1949 to 1952, and oversaw the drafting of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. It was designed to incorporate a traditional [[civil liberties]] approach to securing "effective political democracy", from the strong traditions of freedom and liberty in the United Kingdom. As a founding member of the [[Council of Europe]], the UK acceded to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in March 1951. However it was not until the 1960s that British citizens were able to bring claims in the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR). During the 1980s, groups such as [[Charter 88]] (which invoked the 300th anniversary of the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688 and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]]) accused the executive of misusing its power and argued that a new British Bill of Rights was needed to secure human rights in the UK.

In its manifesto for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], the Labour party pledged to incorporate the European Convention into domestic law.  When the election resulted in a landslide Labour victory, the party, under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]], fulfilled this pledge through Parliamentary passage of the Human Rights Act the following year.

The 1997 white paper "Rights Brought Home"&lt;ref&gt;Home Office, “Rights Brought Home: The Human Rights Bill” (Cm 3782, 1997) para 1.14&lt;/ref&gt; stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It takes on average five years to get an action into the European Court of Human Rights once all domestic remedies have been exhausted; and it costs an average of £30,000. Bringing these rights home will mean that the British people will be able to argue for their rights in the British courts – without this inordinate delay and cost.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Structure of the Act==
The Human Rights Act places a duty on all courts and tribunals in the [[United Kingdom]] to interpret legislation so far as possible in a way compatible with the rights laid down in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] ([[Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998|section 3(1)]]).  Where this is not possible, the court may issue a "declaration of incompatibility".  The declaration does not invalidate the legislation, but permits the amendment of the legislation by a special fast-track procedure under section 10 of the Act. As of August 2006, 20 declarations had been made, of which six were overturned on appeal.

The Human Rights Act applies to all public bodies within the United Kingdom, including central government, local authorities, and bodies exercising public functions. However, it does not include Parliament when it is acting in its legislative capacities.

===Section 3===
{{main|Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998}}
Section 3 is a particularly wide provision that requires courts to interpret both [[primary legislation|primary]] and [[subordinate legislation]] so that their provisions are compatible with the articles of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] which are also part of the Human Rights Act.&lt;ref name="hoffman58"&gt;Hoffman, Rowe (2006). p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  This interpretation goes far beyond normal [[statutory interpretation]],&lt;ref name="hoffman58"/&gt; and includes past and future legislation, therefore preventing the Human Rights Act from being [[implied repeal|impliedly repealed]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Rowe (2008). p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Courts have applied this through three forms of interpretation:  "reading in", inserting words where there are none in a statute; "reading out", where words are omitted from a statute; and "reading down", where a particular meaning is chosen to be in compliance.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Rowe (2006). pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; They do not interpret a statute so as to give it a meaning that would conflict with [[legislative supremacy|legislative intent]], and courts have been reluctant in particular to "read out" provisions for this reason. If it is not possible to so interpret, they may issue a declaration of incompatibility under section 4.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Rowe (2006). pp. 60–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sections 4 and 10===
{{main|Sections 4 and 10 of the Human Rights Act 1998}}
Sections 4 and 10 allows courts to issue a [[declaration of incompatibility]] where it is impossible to use section 3 to interpret primary or subordinate legislation to be compatible with the articles of the European Convention on Human Rights, which are also part of the Human Rights Act.&lt;ref name="section4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/section/4 |title=Human Rights Act 1998: Section 4|work=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, interpretation to comply may conflict with [[legislative supremacy|legislative intent]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Rowe (2006). p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is considered a measure of last resort. A range of [[superior court]]s can issue a declaration of incompatibility.&lt;ref name="section4"/&gt;

A declaration of incompatibility is not binding on the parties to the proceedings in which it is made,&lt;ref name="section4"/&gt; nor can a declaration invalidate legislation.&lt;ref name="hoffman6465"&gt;Hoffman, Rowe (2006). pp. 64.–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 4 therefore achieves its aim through political rather than legal means.

Section 10 gives a government minister the power to make a "remedial order" in response to either
* a declaration of incompatibility, from which there is no possibility of appeal,&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Rowe (2006). pp. 65.–66.&lt;/ref&gt; or
* a ruling of the European Court of Human Rights

A remedial order may "make such amendments to the legislation as [the Minister] considers necessary to remove the incompatibility".&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights act, section 10&lt;/ref&gt;  Remedial orders do not require full legislative approval,&lt;ref name="hoffman6465"/&gt; but must be approved by resolutions of each House of Parliament.  In especially urgent cases, Parliamentary approval may be retroactive.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Act, schedule 2, subsection 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Remedial orders may have retroactive effect, but no one may be guilty of a criminal offence solely as the result of the retroactive effect of a remedial order.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Act, schedule 2, subsection 1, clause 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 10 has been used to make small adjustments to bring legislation into line with Convention rights although entirely new pieces of legislation are sometimes necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Rowe (2006). p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2014, 29 declarations of incompatibility have been issued, of which&lt;ref name="lse"&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/389272/responding-to-human-rights-judgments-2013-2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* 8 have been struck down on appeal
* 1 is pending appeal, as of December 2014
* 16 have been remedied through the ordinary legislative process (including amendment or repeal of the offending legislation).
* 3 have been addressed through remedial orders

The one case not to have been remedied, as of December 2014, is ''Smith v. Scott'', concerning [[Felony disenfranchisement#United Kingdom|the right of serving prisoners to vote]] in the UK.&lt;ref name="lse"/&gt;

===Sections 6 to 9===
Although the Act, by its own terms, applies only to [[public bodies]], it has had increasing influence on private law litigation between individual citizens leading some academics (source?) to state that it has [[horizontal effect]] (as in disputes between citizens) as well as [[vertical effect]] (as in disputes between the state and citizens). This is because section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act defines courts and tribunals as public bodies. That means their judgments must comply with human rights obligations of the state, whether a dispute is between the state and citizens, or between citizens, except in cases of declarations of incompatibility. Therefore, judges have a duty to act in compatibility with the Convention even when an action is a private one between two citizens.

The way that public duty is exercised in private law was dealt with in a June 2016 decision [http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/format.cgi?doc=/uk/cases/UKSC/2016/28.html McDonald v McDonald &amp; Ors [2016&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; UKSC 28 (15 June 2016)] where the UK Supreme Court firstly considered the question ''"... whether a court, when entertaining a claim for possession by a private sector owner against a residential occupier, should be required to consider the proportionality of evicting the occupier, in the light of section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 and article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights"''

The Supreme Court decided (paragraph 46) that ''"there are many cases where the court can be required to balance conflicting Convention rights of two parties, eg where a person is seeking to rely on her article 8 rights to restrain a newspaper from publishing an article which breaches her privacy, and where the newspaper relies on article 10. But such disputes arise not from contractual arrangements made between two private parties, but '''tortious or quasi-tortious relationships''', where the legislature has expressly, impliedly or through inaction, left it to the courts to carry out the balancing exercise"''. 

Therefore, in cases ''"where the parties are in a '''contractual relationship''' in respect of which the legislature has prescribed how their respective Convention rights are to be respected"'' then the Court decided, as set out in paragraph 59
''"In these circumstances, while we accept that the Strasbourg court jurisprudence relied on by the appellant does provide some support for the notion that article 8 was engaged when Judge Corrie was asked to make an order for possession against her, there is no support for the proposition that the judge could be required to consider the proportionality of the order which he would have made under the provisions of the 1980 and 1988 Acts. Accordingly, for the reasons set out in paras 40-46 above, we would dismiss this appeal on the first issue."''

Paragraph 40 supposed that ''"... it is not open to the tenant to contend that article 8 could justify a different order from that which is mandated by the '''contractual relationship''' between the parties, at least where, as here, there are legislative provisions which the democratically elected legislature has decided properly balance the competing interests of private sector landlords and residential tenants."

The duty of state judges to apply Convention rights to disputes between citizens is therefore about determining relationships between them, and applying domestic legislation accordingly. If the duty is carried out then it's likely there is [[Article_6_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights|Article 6 compliance]].

Section 7 limits a right to bring proceedings under section 6 only to victims (or potential victims) of the unlawful act of the public authority.

Section 8 provides a right for a court to make any remedy they consider just and appropriate. A remedy under the Act is therefore not limited to a [[Declaration of incompatibility]] possibly taking into account the equitable maxim [[Maxims_of_equity#Equity_delights_to_do_justice_and_not_by_halves|Equity delights to do justice and not by halves]].

Section 9 provides a right to challenge the compliance of judicial acts made by the UK, but only by exercising a right of appeal as set out by the [[Access to Justice Act 1999]] (although not precluding a right to judicial review). For example, whether a judicial act properly applies legislation, or not.

===Other Sections===
Section 8 says that UK judges can grant any remedy that is considered just and appropriate.

==Rights protected under the Act==
Many rights established under the Human Rights Act 1998 were already protected under UK law (such as freedom), but the purpose of the Act was largely to establish the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in British law.

Section 21(5) of the Act completely abolished the [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|death penalty in the United Kingdom]], effective on royal assent. The death penalty had already been abolished for all civilian offences, including murder ([[Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965]]) and treason ([[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]]), but remained in force for certain military offences (although these provisions had not been used for several decades).

This provision was not required by the European Convention (protocol 6 permits the death penalty in time of war; protocol 13, which prohibits the death penalty for all circumstances, did not then exist); rather, the government introduced it as a late amendment in response to parliamentary pressure.

The Act provides that it is unlawful for a "public authority" to act in such a way as to contravene "Convention rights".&lt;ref&gt;Section 6(1)&lt;/ref&gt; For these purposes public authority includes any other person "whose functions are functions of a public nature."&lt;ref&gt;Section 6(3)(b)&lt;/ref&gt; It also explicitly includes the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Section 6(3)(a)&lt;/ref&gt; Convention rights includes only those rights specified in section 1 of the Act (these are recited in full in Schedule 1).&lt;ref&gt;The full text of Schedule 1 (along with that of the rest of the Act) can be found at the Office of Public Sector Information Website: [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/80042--d.htm#sch1]&lt;/ref&gt; In the interpretation of those rights the Act provides that the domestic Courts "may" take into account the jurisprudence of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR).&lt;ref&gt;Section 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 7 enables any person with standing (as stipulated by Article 34 of the Convention) to raise an action against a public authority which has acted or proposes to act in such a Convention-contravening manner.&lt;ref&gt;Section 7(7)&lt;/ref&gt; This is a more rigorous standard than is ordinarily applied to standing in English, although not Scottish, [[judicial review]].

If it is held that the public authority has violated the [[claimant]]'s Convention rights, then the court is empowered to "grant such relief or remedy, or make such order, within its powers as it considers just and appropriate."&lt;ref&gt;Section 8(1)&lt;/ref&gt; This can include an award of [[damages]], although the Act provides limitations on the court's capacity to make such an award.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. sections 8(2)-(5) and Section 9(2)-(3) which provides additional protection to the courts.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Act also provides a defence for public authorities if their Convention violating act is in pursuance of a mandatory obligation imposed upon them by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] [[primary legislation]].&lt;ref&gt;Section 6(2).&lt;/ref&gt; The Act envisages that this will ordinarily be a difficult standard to meet though since it requires the courts to read such legislation (and for that matter [[subordinate legislation]]) "So far as it is possible to do so…in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights."&lt;ref&gt;Section 3(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Where it is impossible to read primary legislation in a Convention compliant manner, the only sanction available to the courts is to make a [[declaration of incompatibility]] in respect of it.&lt;ref&gt;Section 4&lt;/ref&gt; The power to do so is restricted to the higher courts.&lt;ref name=S4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/section/4|title=Human Rights Act 1998|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a declaration has no direct impact upon the continuing force of the legislation but it is likely to produce public pressure upon the government to remove the incompatibility. It also strengthens the case of a claimant armed with such a decision from the domestic courts in any subsequent appeal to ECtHR. In order to provide swift compliance with the Convention the [[Act of Parliament|Act]] allows [[Minister (government)|ministers]] to take remedial action to amend even offending primary [[legislation]] via [[subordinate legislation]].&lt;ref&gt;Section 10(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable human rights case law==
* [[Lee Clegg]]'s murder conviction gave rise to the first case invoking the Act, brought by  ''[[The Times]]'' in October 2000 which sought to overturn a libel ruling against the newspaper.
* ''[[Campbell v. MGN Ltd.]]'' [2002] EWCA Civ 1373, [[Naomi Campbell]] and [[Sara Cox]] both sought to assert their [[right to privacy]] under the Act. Both cases were successful for the complainant (Campbell's on the second attempt; Cox's attempt was not judicially decided but an out of court settlement was reached before the issue could be tested in court) and an amendment to British law to incorporate a provision for privacy is expected to be introduced.
* ''[[Venables and Thompson v. News Group Newspapers]]'' [2001] 1 All ER 908, the [[James Bulger murder case]] tested whether the Article 8 (privacy) rights of Venables and Thomson, the convicted murderers of Bulger, applied when four newspapers sought to publish their new identities and whereabouts, using their Article 10 rights of freedom of expression. The judge, [[Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, Baroness Butler-Sloss|Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss]], granted permanent global injunctions ordering that the material not be published because of the disastrous consequences such disclosure might have for the former convicts, not least the possibility of physical harm or death (hence claims for Article 2 rights (right to life) were entertained, and sympathised with).
* ''[[A and Others v. Secretary of State for the Home Department]]'' [2004] [https://web.archive.org/web/20151007164149/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld200405/ldjudgmt/jd041216/a%26oth-1.htm UKHL 56], on 16 December 2004, the [[House of Lords]] held that Part 4 of the [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]], under whose powers a number of non-UK nationals were detained in [[Belmarsh Prison]], was incompatible with the Human Rights Act. This precipitated the enactment of the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]] to replace Part 4 of the 2001 Act.
* ''R. v. Chauhan and Hollingsworth'': Amesh Chauhan and Dean Hollingsworth were photographed by a [[speed camera]] in 2000. As is standard practice for those caught in this way, they were sent a form by the police asking them to identify who was driving the vehicle at the time. They protested under the Human Rights Act, arguing that they could not be required to give evidence against themselves. An initial judgment, by Judge Peter Crawford at Birmingham Crown Court, ruled in their favour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/834532.stm|title=Speeding loophole is legal 'nightmare'|date=15 July 2000|work=[[BBC Online]]|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was later reversed. The same issue came to light in Scotland with ''Procurator Fiscal v Brown'' [2000] UKPC D3,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants = Procurator Fiscal v Brown | court = UKPC | year = 2000 | num = D3 | parallelcite = 2001 SC (PC) 43, (2001) 3 LGLR 24, [2003] AC 681, [2001] 2 WLR 817, [2001] RTR 11, 2001 SCCR 62, 2000 GWD 40–151, [2001] 2 All ER 97, [2000] UKPC D 3, 11 BHRC 179, 2001 SLT 59, [2003] 1 AC 681, [2001] RTR 121, [2001] UKHRR 333, [2001] HRLR 9 | date = 5 December 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which a woman, when apprehended on suspicion of theft of a bottle of gin, was drunk and was asked by police to identify who had been driving her car (which was nearby) at the time she arrived at the superstore.
* ''[[Price v. Leeds City Council]]'' [2005]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants = Price v. Leeds | court = EWCA | division = Civ | year = 2005 | num = 289 | parallelcite = [2005] 3 All ER 573, [2005] EWCA Civ 289, [2005] 1 WLR 1825 | date = 16 March 2005 | courtname = auto }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March 2005 the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] upheld a High Court ruling that Leeds City Council could not infringe the right to a home of a [[Romani people|Romani]] family, the Maloneys, by evicting them from public land. The court however referred the case to the [[House of Lords]] as this decision conflicted with a ruling from the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR).
* In March 2006,{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} the High Court in London ruled against a hospital's bid to turn off the ventilator that kept the child, known as Baby MB, alive. The 19-month-old baby has the genetic condition [[spinal muscular atrophy]], which leads to almost total paralysis. The parents of the child fought for his right to life, despite claims from medics that the invasive ventilation would cause an 'intolerable life'.
* ''[[Connors v. UK]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants = Connors v. United Kingdom | court = ECtHR | year = 2004 | num = 223 | eucase = 66746/01 | parallelcite = [2004] 4 PLR 16, (2005) 40 EHRR 9, [2004] NPC 86, [2004] HLR 52, 40 EHRR 9, 16 BHRC 639| date = 27 May 2004|courtname = auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; a judgment given by ECtHR, declared that [[nomads|travellers]] who had their licences to live on local authority-owned land suddenly revoked had been discriminated against, in comparison to the treatment of mobile-home owners who did not belong to the traveller population, and thus their Article 14 (protection from discrimination) and Article 8 (right to respect for the home) rights had been infringed. However, there has never been a case where the Act has been successfully invoked to allow travellers to remain on greenbelt land, and indeed the prospects of this ever happening seem highly unlikely after the [[House of Lords]] decision in ''[[Kay v Lambeth LBC]]'' which severely restricted the occasions on which Article 8 may be invoked to protect someone from eviction in the absence of some legal right over the land.
* ''[[Afghan hijackers case 2006]]'', in May 2006, a politically controversial decision regarding the treatment of nine Afghan men who hijacked a plane to flee from the [[Taliban]], caused widespread condemnation by many [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] newspapers (most notably ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''), the broadsheets and the leaders of both the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. It was ruled by an [[Immigration]] [[Tribunals in the United Kingdom|Tribunal]], under the Human Rights Act, that the hijackers could remain in the United Kingdom; a subsequent court decision ruled that the government had abused its power in restricting the hijackers' right to work.
* ''[[Mosley v News Group Newspapers Limited]]'' (2008), [[Max Mosley]] challenged an invasion of his private life after the ''[[News of the World]]'' exposed his involvement in a [[BDSM|sadomasochistic]] sex act. The case resulted in Mr Mosley being awarded [[Pound sterling|£]]60,000 in damages.

==Criticism==

===Excessive rights===

During the campaign for the 2005 parliamentary elections the Conservatives under [[Michael Howard]] declared their intention to "overhaul or scrap" the Human Rights Act:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The time had come to liberate the nation from the avalanche of [[political correctness]], costly litigation, feeble justice, and culture of compensation running riot in Britain today and warning that the politically correct regime ushered in by Labour's enthusiastic adoption of human rights legislation has turned the age-old principle of fairness on its head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capc.co.uk/damaging_political_correctness.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105231112/http://www.capc.co.uk/damaging_political_correctness.htm| archivedate=5 November 2013|title=MPs attacking political correctness|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source|date=December 2016}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Judicial powers===
{{main|Judicial activism|Separation of powers in the United Kingdom}}
Constitutional critics since the Human Rights Bill was tabled at parliament claimed it would result in the unelected judiciary making substantive judgments about government policies and "mass-legislating" in their amendments to the [[common law]] resulting in a usurpation of Parliament's [[legislative supremacy]] and an expansion of the UK courts' [[justiciability]]. A leading case of ''[[R (on the application of Daly) v Secretary of State for the Home Department]]'' highlights how the new proportionality test borrowed from ECtHR jurisprudence has allowed a greater scrutiny of the substantive merits of decisions of public bodies, meaning that actions against such bodies, Judicial Reviews, are more of an appeal than a traditional judicial review.&lt;ref name=craig/&gt;

They stress the overriding interpretative obligation of courts under section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act to read primary legislation as Convention-compliant, so far as is possible, is not dependent upon the presence of ambiguity in legislation.&lt;ref name=craig&gt;Craig, Administrative Law, 6th ed p560&lt;/ref&gt; Section 3(1) could require the court to depart from the unambiguous meaning that legislation would otherwise bear subject to the constraint that this modified interpretation must be one "possible" interpretation of the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/format.cgi?doc=/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/30.html&amp;query=(Ghaidan)+AND+(v.)+AND+(Godin-Mendoza) Ghaidan v. Godin-Mendoza] [2004] 2 AC 557 n.63 para.32&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Craig (law professor)|Paul Craig]] argues that this results in the courts adopting linguistically strained interpretations instead of issuing [[declarations of incompatibility]].

Rulings based on the Human Rights Act have been criticised by [[Brenda Hale, Baroness Hale of Richmond|Lady Hale]]. In 2011 she said that the Act was overused, and criticised the decision of European human rights judges to ensure all signatory states give some prisoners the vote.{{r|ladyhale}}

===Journalistic freedom===
In 2008, [[Paul Dacre]] (as editor of the [[Daily Mail]]) criticised the Human Rights Act for allowing, in effect, a right to privacy at English law despite the fact that Parliament has not passed such legislation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} He was referring to the [[indirect horizontal effect]] of the Human Rights Act on the doctrine of [[breach of confidence]] which has moved [[English law]] closer towards a [[common law]] right to privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Phillipson |first=Gavin |title=Transforming Breach of Confidence?

===Inadequacy===
In contrast, some have argued that the Human Rights Act does not give adequate protection to rights because of the ability for the government to derogate from Convention rights under article 15. Recent cases such as ''[[R (ProLife Alliance) v. BBC]]'' [2002] EWCA Civ 297 have been decided in reference to common law rights rather than statutory rights. Where there is no clear [[precedent]] in the [[common law]], judges remain accused of [[judicial activism]].&lt;ref&gt;Public Law: Adam Tomkins p192&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrorism-related complaints===
More [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] politicians in the two largest parties, including some ministers, have criticised the Human Rights Act as to the willingness of the judiciary to make declarations on incompatibility against terrorism legislation. [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|Baron Reid]] argued that the Act was hampering the fight against global terrorism in regard to controversial [[control order]]s:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is a very serious threat – and I am the first to admit that the means we have of fighting it are so inadequate that we are fighting with one arm tied behind our backs. So I hope when we bring forward proposals in the next few weeks that we will have a little less party politics and a little more support for national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/frontpage/story/0,,2087867,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Reid warning to judges over control orders | first=Alan | last=Travis | date=25 May 2007 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Planned replacement==
In 2007, Howard's successor as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], [[David Cameron]], vowed to repeal the Human Rights Act if he was elected, instead replacing it with a "Bill of Rights" for Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5114102.stm|title=Cameron 'could scrap' rights act|accessdate=2 April 2007 | work=BBC News | date=25 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human rights organisation [[JUSTICE]] released a discussion paper entitled ''A Bill of Rights for Britain?'', examining the case for updating the Human Rights Act with an entrenched bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justice.org.uk/data/files/resources/11/A-British-Bill-of-Rights.pdf|title=A British Bill of Rights: Informing the debate|last=|first=|date=2007|website=|publisher=JUSTICE|isbn=978 0 907247 43 2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528220841/http://www.justice.org.uk/data/files/resources/11/A-British-Bill-of-Rights.pdf|archive-date=28 May 2013|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], the [[Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement]] said that the Human Rights Act would be investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8695213.stm |title=Coalition deal: Tories give more ground |first=James |last=Landale |date=20 May 2010 |work=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, following controversial rulings from both the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) and the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], David Cameron suggested a "British Bill of Rights".&lt;ref&gt;Gallop, Nick in The Constitution and Constitutional Reform p.60 (Philip Allan, 2011) {{ISBN|978-0-340-98720-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government commission set up to investigate the case for a Bill of Rights had a split of opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/mar/18/deadlock-bill-of-rights-commission | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Alan | last1=Travis | first2=Patrick | last2=Wintour | title=Deadlock likely on commission pondering a British bill of rights | date=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge [[Dean Spielmann]], the President of ECtHR, warned in 2013 that the United Kingdom could not withdraw from the Convention on Human Rights without jeopardising its membership of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/jun/04/uk-human-rights-withdrawal-political-disaster "UK's withdrawal from human rights law would be 'political disaster'"] ''The Guardian'', 4 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] planned to repeal the Act and replace it with a "British Bill of Rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/interactive/2014/oct/03/conservatives-human-rights-act-full-document|title = Conservatives plan to scrap Human Rights Act|date = |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 election]] win for the Conservative Party, [[Michael Gove]], the Secretary of State for Justice, was charged with implementing the reforms which were previously blocked by the Liberal Democrats in the coalition government.{{r|gove}} The Conservative Party manifesto said that the new bill will "break the formal link between British Courts and the European Court of Human Rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.conservatives.com/manifesto|title = The Conservative Party Manifesto 2015|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As before 1998 claims relying on ECtHR jurisprudence which conflicted with the "British Bill of Rights" would have to go to a court in Strasbourg rather than being able to be heard in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/what-is-the-human-rights-act-and-why-does-michael-gove-want-to-scrap-it-10240527.html|title = Human Rights Act: What is it and why does Michael Gove want to scrap the policy? |date = |work=The Independent |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil liberty advocates have expressed concern that the proposed changes would "erode the right to life, the right to privacy, the right to a fair trial, the right to protest and the right to freedom from torture and discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://rt.com/uk/257469-tory-human-rights-act/|title = Tories' repeal of Human Rights Act will spark constitutional crisis, erode civil liberties – experts|date = |work=RT UK |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:IDI Krakow Session 2005.jpg|thumb|Members of the Institute at the 2005 [[Kraków]] Session]]

The '''Institute of International Law''' ([[French language|French]]: '''Institut de Droit International''') is an organization devoted to the study and development of [[international law]],  whose membership comprises the world's leading public international lawyers. The organization is generally considered the most authoritative world academy of international law, and its work earned the Nobel Peace Prize in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.idi-iil.org/en/a-propos/prix-nobel-de-la-paix/ |title= Nobel Peace Prize |via= The Institute of International Law }}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''
==History==
The institute was founded by [[Gustave Moynier]] and [[Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns]], together with 9 other renowned international lawyers, on 8 September 1873 in the ''Salle de l'Arsenal'' of the [[Ghent]] Town Hall in [[Belgium]]. The founders of 1873 were: 
* [[Pasquale Stanislao Mancini]] (from Rome), President; 
* [[Émile Louis Victor de Laveleye|Emile de Laveleye]] (from Liege); 
* [[Tobias Michael Carel Asser]] (from Amsterdam); 
* [[James Lorimer (jurist)|James Lorimer]] (from Edinburgh); 
* [[Wladimir Besobrassof]] (from Saint-Petersburg); 
* [[Gustave Moynier]] (from Geneva); 
* [[Johann Kaspar Bluntschli|Jean Gaspar Bluntschli]] (from Heidelberg); 
* [[Augusto Pierantoni]] (from Naples); 
* [[Carlos Calvo (historian)|Carlos Calvo]] (from Buenos Aires); 
* [[Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns]] (from Ghent); 
* [[David Dudley Field]] (from New York)

==Organization==
The Institute is a private body, made up of ''associates'', ''members'', and ''honorary members''. The Statute stipulates that the number of members and associates under the age of 80 cannot be over 132. The members, invited by the organization, are persons who have demonstrated notable scholarly work in the area of international law, and is restricted to those who are considered relatively free of political pressure. The organisation attempts to have members broadly distributed around the world. 

The organisation holds biannual congresses for the study of international law as it currently exists, and passes resolutions proposing modifications to international law. It does not comment on specific disputes.

While its recommendations cover international law in its many forms, some of its resolutions particularly pertain to [[international human rights law|human rights law]] and peaceful [[dispute resolution]]. It is for this reason that the organization received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

The organization remains active, with a congress held in Naples in Sept 2009. The location of the institute's headquarters rotates according to the origin of the Secretary General. The current headquarters are at the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] in Geneva, Switzerland. 

Current members of the Institut include, amongst other prominent lawyers and legal academics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idi-iil.org/idiE/navig_members.html |title=IDI-Membres |publisher=Idi-iil.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704193742/http://www.idi-iil.org/idiE/navig_members.html |archivedate=2013-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; judges of the [[International Court of Justice]], International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, and [[International Criminal Court]]. 

Recent resolutions from the organization cover many important areas such as universal jurisdiction, provisional measures, regime of wrecks, immunity, environment, use of force, etc.

The Institut publishes its Annuaire, containing the reports of the commissions, deliberations of the plenary sessions, and any resulting declarations and resolutions. The records of the administrative sessions including elections are also included in the Annuaire. The website for the works of the Institut is here: http://www.idi-iil.org/en/publications/

The Institut maintains a website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idi-iil.org idi-iil.org]&lt;/ref&gt;. The website has been recently revamped and contains much useful information such as the declarations and resolutions, and some works in progress for future inclusion in the Annuaire.

Following his departure from Chelsea, Terry spent one season with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in the [[EFL Championship]] before retiring.

====Early years====
Born in [[Barking, London|Barking]], London, Terry attended [[Eastbury Comprehensive School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Terry: Defender of the faith |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/john-terry-defender-of-the-faith-412513.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=19 August 2006 |location=London |first=James |last=Lawton}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played for local [[Sunday league football|Sunday league]] team [[Senrab F.C.|Senrab]], which also featured future [[Premier League]] players [[Sol Campbell]], [[Jermain Defoe]], [[Bobby Zamora]], [[Ledley King]] and [[Jlloyd Samuel]].&lt;ref name = "senrab"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1378677/John-Terry-saves-Senrab-Seeing-faces-children-brilliant-says-club-secretary.html |title=John Terry saves Senrab: Seeing the faces of the children will be brilliant, says club secretary |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London |date=20 April 2011 |accessdate=24 December 2013 |first=Laurie |last=Whitwell}}{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a boy, he initially was part of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]'s youth system, joining them as a midfielder in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Keogh, Frank (3 May 2010).

Retrieved 3 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to Chelsea at 14, playing for the club's youth and reserve teams. It was due to a shortage of central defenders that he was moved to centre-back, the position he plays today. After finishing school, he joined the club on a [[Youth Training Scheme|YTS]] at age 16 and signed professional terms a year later.&lt;ref name=manforallseasons/&gt;

Terry made his Chelsea debut on 28 October 1998 as a late substitute in a [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] tie with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]; his first start came later that season in an [[FA Cup]] third-round match, a 2–0 win over [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He spent a brief period on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] with [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in 2000 to build up his first team experience and was the subject of interest from both Forest manager [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]] and [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] manager [[Steve Bruce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12876_5864456,00.html |title=Terry was almost a terrier |publisher=Sky Sports |date=16 January 2010 |accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ptt.cc/man/Chelsea/D70/DD67/D51F/M.1123831651.A.ABC.html |title=Bruce knows value of Terry |website=Sporting Life |date=28 March 2005 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2011501 |title=The Thursday Interview: John Terry |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |date=1 April 2010 |accessdate=5 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140505161835/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2011501 |archivedate=5 May 2014 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/1436328 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612191125/https://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/1436328 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 June 2018 |title=Ten Years Terry Talking |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |date=28 October 2008 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Terry was involved in an altercation with a bouncer at a West London nightclub with Chelsea teammate [[Jody Morris]] and [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]'s [[Des Byrne]], which led to him being charged with assault and [[affray]]. In August 2002, Terry was acquitted of the charges in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/england/2205505.stm |title=Footballers cleared over club brawl |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=10 September 2006 |date=22 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the affair, he was given a temporary ban from the [[England national football team|English national team]] by [[The Football Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/1768694.stm |title=Terry faces England exile |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 January 2002 |accessdate=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, along with Chelsea teammates [[Frank Lampard]], Jody Morris, [[Eiður Guðjohnsen]] and former teammate [[Frank Sinclair]], in September 2001 Terry was fined two weeks wages by Chelsea after drunkenly harassing grieving American tourists in the immediate aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/1558855.stm |title=Chelsea stars fined for binge |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 September 2001 |accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/the-first-xi-of-shame-united-6948817.html |title=The First XI of Shame United |newspaper=Evening Standard |location=London |date=11 September 2001 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his early days at Chelsea, Terry shared a flat with [[Andrew Crofts (footballer)|Andrew Crofts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/internationals/chelsea-fan-crofts-looks-to-hero-terry-for-welsh-inspiration-509721.html |title=Chelsea fan Crofts looks to hero Terry for Welsh inspiration |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=6 October 2005 |accessdate=14 June 2010 |first=Paul |last=Walker}}{{Dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Desailly's retirement, new Chelsea manager [[José Mourinho]] chose Terry as his club captain, a choice which was vindicated throughout the 2004–05 season as Chelsea won the Premier League title in record-breaking fashion with the best defensive record in [[English Football League|Football League]] history with the most clean sheets and the most points accrued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2016/11/14/three-best-defensive-teams-in-premier-league-history-including-a |title=Three best defensive teams in Premier League history, including Arsenal |publisher=HITC |accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was voted [[PFA Players' Player of the Year|Player of the Year]] by his fellow professionals in England&lt;ref name=pfa/&gt; and scored eight goals, including a late winner against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], in the [[UEFA Champions League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/henrywinter/2356406/Terry-supplies-a-sensational-finish.html |title=Terry supplies a sensational finish |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=9 March 2005 |accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was voted the best defender in the Champions League for the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=318936.html |title=Best Defender 2005 |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2005, he was selected as a member of the World XI at the [[FIFPro]] awards.

In the 2006–07 season, Terry missed matches for Chelsea due to a recurring back problem. On 26 December 2006, José Mourinho stated that his captain might require surgery to fix the problem. In Terry's absence Chelsea drew 2–2 at home to both Reading and Fulham over Christmas, draws that were to prove crucial in the destiny of the Premier League title for that season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Official Chelsea FC Annual 2008 |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |publisher=Grange Communications Ltd |year=2007 |isbn= |location=Edinburagh |pages=7 |quote= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 December, Chelsea released a press statement saying Terry had had back surgery: "The operation to remove a sequestrated lumbar [[intervertebral disc]] was successful."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/6215445.stm "Terry has surgery on back injury"] BBC Sport&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was expected to return in the match against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], which Chelsea won 3–2 thanks to a late goal from winger [[Arjen Robben]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Mossop |first=James |title=Robben revives Chelsea |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2352806/Robben-revives-Chelsea.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=24 December 2006 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry was missing once again, due to the recurring back problem.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He made his return in Chelsea's 1–0 victory over Charlton Athletic on 3 February 2007 coming on in the 88th minute for Claude Makelele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6305409.stm |title=Charlton 0–1 Chelsea |publisher=BBC |accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry played his first 90 minutes of football for nearly three months in Chelsea's 3–0 victory over [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and received much applause from the Chelsea faithful. Didier Drogba scored two goals for Chelsea in that match, while the other goal came courtesy of an own goal from [[Abel Xavier]] of Middlesbrough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6327029.stm |title=Chelsea 3–0 Middlesbrough |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Saj |last=Chowdhury |date=10 February 2007 |accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playing in the UEFA Champions League round of 16 away against [[FC Porto|Porto]], he suffered another injury, this time to his ankle, and was set to miss the [[2007 Football League Cup Final|2007 League Cup Final]] against Arsenal, but managed to recover from the injury within days and played in the final. During the second half of the match, at an attacking corner, he threw himself at the ball with a diving header; Arsenal's [[Abou Diaby]], in an attempt to clear the ball, kicked Terry in the face. Terry was unconscious for several minutes, at which point he nearly swallowed his tongue. He was carried off the field on a stretcher and immediately transferred to the [[University Hospital of Wales]]. Terry discharged himself the same day and returned to the [[Millennium Stadium]] to celebrate his team's 2–1 win. The only recollection he had of the second half is walking out onto the pitch and he did not remember the ten minutes he played prior to his injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/6395301.stm |title=Terry recovers after head injury |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 February 2007 |accessdate=26 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to lead Chelsea to the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League#Semi-finals|semi-final]] of the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]], the third time in four years that Chelsea had made it to the final four of the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2008/matches/round=15107/match=301907/postmatch/quotes/index.html |title=Grant relief after Fenerbahçe fright |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, Terry captained Chelsea in the [[2007 FA Cup Final]], in the first FA Cup final at the new [[Wembley Stadium]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==International career==

Terry made his England debut in June 2003 against [[Serbia and Montenegro national football team|Serbia and Montenegro]], and started his first match for England on 20 August 2003 at [[Portman Road]], [[Ipswich]], in a friendly against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]].

In 2005 during a [[FIFA World Cup]] qualifying match against [[Poland national football team|Poland]], Terry wore England's captain armband, replacing [[Michael Owen]] as captain after the latter was substituted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2010/feb/05/john-terry-career-in-pictures |title=John Terry's international career in pictures |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has cemented his place in the England squad by being selected for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/4983618.stm |title=Walcott &amp; Lennon in England squad |publisher=BBC |accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a warm-up match for that tournament against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] on 30 May 2006, Terry scored his first goal for England, the team's second in a 3–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/slideshow/468/3 |title=3.

On 10 August 2006, [[Steve McClaren]] named John Terry as the England captain, succeeding [[David Beckham]]. McClaren said, "Choosing a captain is one of the most important decisions a coach has to make. I'm certain I've got the right man in John Terry. I'm convinced he will prove to be one of the best captains England has ever had."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/4780745.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |title=Terry named new England skipper |date=10 August 2006 |accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry scored a goal on his debut as the England captain, in a friendly international against [[Greece national football team|Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/4794867.stm |title=England 4–0 Greece |publisher=BBC |accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first goal of the match and also the first goal during McClaren's reign as manager.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} However, with Terry as captain, England did not qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2008]] – their first absence from a tournament finals since the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/sounders/england-loses-to-croatia-fails-to-qualify-for-euro-2008/ |title=England loses to Croatia, fails to qualify for Euro 2008 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Midway through the qualification campaign, Terry had accepted that he would "bear full responsibility" should England fail to qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=6 June 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6725433.stm |title=Terry will take blame for failure |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=2 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 2007, Terry became the first player in the senior England team to score an international goal at the new Wembley Stadium when he scored England's goal from a header in the box after a free kick cross by David Beckham in a 1–1 draw with Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/6712043.stm |title=England 1–1 Brazil |publisher=BBC |accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost a year later, he scored a similar headed goal once again from a free kick cross by David Beckham to put England 1–0 up against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] on 28 May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-05-29/terry-scores-as-england-downs-us/2452144?pfm=ms |title=Terry scores as England downs US |publisher=ABC |accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terry was confirmed as the England captain in August, and captained England in qualifying for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} During his first match after being reinstated as the permanent England captain he was given a torrid time by [[Milan Baroš]] and was turned far too easily when Baros scored the first goal for the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The match ended 2–2 with [[Joe Cole]] scoring a fortunate equaliser for England in the 92nd minute of the match.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He scored his first competitive England goal against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] in the qualifiers for the World Cup, grabbing a late winner after earlier giving away a free kick which saw [[Andriy Shevchenko]] equalise for Ukraine.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

On 5 February 2010, following [[#Extramarital affair allegations|allegations regarding Terry's private life]], England manager [[Fabio Capello]] announced that Terry was removed as the captain of the England team.&lt;ref name=dropped&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/john-terry-no-comment-from-fa-over-future-as-england-captain-1-2238887 |title=Breaking: John Terry dropped as England captain |newspaper=Yorkshire Evening Post |location=Leeds |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by fellow defender Rio Ferdinand.&lt;ref name=strips&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8495604.stm |title=Fabio Capello strips John Terry of England captaincy |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=5 February 2010 |date=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2010 FIFA World Cup, England started with two draws against the United States and [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], which received heavy criticism from the English media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=McCarra |title=England labour to goalless draw with Algeria |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/18/england-algeria-world-cup-2010-match-report |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=18 June 2006 |accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mario Balotelli and John Terry England-Italy Euro 2012.JPG|thumb|upright|Terry (right) playing for England at [[UEFA Euro 2012]]]]

Two days after the Algeria match in a media interview, Terry hinted at dissatisfaction with Capello's team selection and stated that the players were bored with little to do in the evenings at their training base; he also said that a clear-the-air team meeting would take place that evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8751854.stm |title=Fabio Capello hits out at John Terry's 'big mistake' |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Capello responded by saying that Terry had made "a very big mistake" in challenging his authority to the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/21/world-cup-2010-fabio-capello-john-terry |title=World Cup 2010: Fabio Capello berates John Terry for 'very big mistake' |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |agency=Press Association |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 March 2011, Capello reinstated Terry as England captain following a long-term injury to previous captain Rio Ferdinand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/3284/euro-2012/2011/03/19/2402787/chelseas-john-terry-reinstated-as-england-captain-on |title=Chelsea's John Terry reinstated as England captain on permanent basis |publisher=Goal.com |first=Nathan |last=Lowe |date=19 March 2011 |accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 February 2012, with Terry due to stand trial due to [[#Racial abuse allegations|allegations that Terry had racially abused]] QPR's Anton Ferdinand, the FA stripped Terry of the England captaincy for the second time. This led to Capello resigning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/feb/03/john-terry-stripped-england-captaincy-racism |title=John Terry stripped of England captaincy by FA ahead of racism trial |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=3 February 2012 |accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/16941457 |title=Capello quits as England manager |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 February 2012 |accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terry was named in new manager [[Roy Hodgson]]'s squad for [[UEFA Euro 2012]] while Rio Ferdinand was left out, leading to heavy speculation that this was to avoid potential conflict due to Terry's upcoming trial for racially abusing Ferdinand's brother Anton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18093759 |title=Rio Ferdinand 'gutted' at England Euro 2012 snub |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry played 90 minutes in all four of England's matches at the Euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.whoscored.com/Players/70/History/John-Terry |title=John Terry – History |website=whoscored.com |accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Racial abuse allegations====
{{Further|R v Terry}}

On 2 November 2011, Terry was placed under police investigation following an allegation of racist abuse made at Anton Ferdinand during a match versus Queens Park Rangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fifield |first=Dominic |title=Police launch investigation into John Terry-Anton Ferdinand incident |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/nov/01/police-john-terry-anton-ferdinand |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=1 November 2011 |accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/11/01/john-terry_n_1069720.html |title=John Terry: Metropolitan Police confirm investigation into England captain's conduct |newspaper=The Huffington Post |date=1 November 2011 |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video footage circulated on the internet led to accusations that Terry called Ferdinand a "fucking black [[cunt]]." In response to the video footage, Terry claimed that he was actually asking Ferdinand, "Oi, Anton, do you think I called you a black cunt?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dominic |last=Fifield |title=John Terry to learn fate after alleged racial slur of Anton Ferdinand |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/oct/24/john-terry-anton-ferdinand-chelsea-qpr |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=24 October 2011 |accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 November 2011, Terry was interviewed under caution by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15932362 |title=John Terry 'interviewed by police' over race allegations |publisher=BBC News |date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 December 2011, he was charged with using racist language by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-16284813 |title=John Terry to be charged over Anton Ferdinand race row |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 December 2011 |accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 February 2012, The Football Association stripped Terry of his England captaincy for the second time, stating that Terry would not captain the national team until the racial abuse allegations against him were resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/16866149 |title=John Terry: FA strips England captaincy from Chelsea defender |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 February 2011 |accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the trial began in July 2012, Terry entered a not guilty plea and was acquitted of the charge on 13 July 2012. The court established that neither Ferdinand nor anyone else had heard Terry's words, but Terry himself admitted that he had directed the words "fucking black cunt" and "fucking knobhead" at Ferdinand, which was affirmed by two expert lip readers from video evidence. Terry maintained that he used the words as a form of [[sarcasm]] and that he was questioning what he thought had been an allegation of racism from Ferdinand; neither lip reader was able to "identify whether the statement was made as a question or in what type of voice it was said." Justice Riddle concluded that while there was no doubt Terry had uttered those words in anger, "it is impossible to be sure exactly what were the words spoken by [Terry] at the relevant time" and that there was a lack of evidence to prove beyond a doubt that Terry had used them as an insult instead of "a challenge to what he believed had been said to him." The court therefore found Terry not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/r-v-john-terry.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713143737/http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/r-v-john-terry.pdf|date=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/epl-news/Terry-cleared-of-racially-abusing-player-in-match/articleshow/14866169.cms |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714053956/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/epl-news/Terry-cleared-of-racially-abusing-player-in-match/articleshow/14866169.cms |archivedate=14 July 2012 |title=Terry cleared of racially abusing player in match |date=13 July 2012 |newspaper=The Times of India |location=Mumbai |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 July 2012, the FA charged Terry for using "abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour" which "included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Ferdinand." The FA had delayed the charge until after the conclusion of Terry's criminal trial. Terry denied the charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Terry charged by the FA over Anton Ferdinand incident |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19021184 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=28 July 2012 |date=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of the FA's hearing, Terry announced his retirement from the English national football team, saying his position had become "untenable" due to the disciplinary charge. On 27 September 2012, the hearing concluded with Terry being found guilty; he was punished with a four-match ban and a £220,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Terry banned and fined by FA over Anton Ferdinand incident |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19723020 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=29 September 2012 |date=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FA published a 63-page report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ruling of the full Regulatory Commission following the substantive disciplinary hearing held between 24th and 27th September 2012 |url=http://www.thefa.com/News/governance/2012/oct/~/media/22A83175745E44468105B57232F085B7.ashx |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the disciplinary proceedings conducted by an Independent Regulatory Commission; it labelled aspects of Terry's defence as "improbable, implausible and contrived," finding it "inherently unlikely that if he had been accused by Mr. Ferdinand of calling him something that ended with the words "black cunt", that Mr. Terry would have added the word "fucking" when he threw the words back, if he was genuinely doing so by way of forceful denial" and "inherently improbable" that he would call Anton Ferdinand a "fucking knobhead" for falsely accusing him of racial abuse. The Commission found it "implausible" that to robustly deny having used the words "black cunt" he "simply repeated" them. His defence in court was not that he had "simply repeated" the words but that he had "sarcastically" repeated them (see above), however, there was no reference to sarcasm in the Regulatory Commission's 63-page written report. The Commission concluded that it was "quite satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that there [was] no credible basis for Mr. Terry's defence that his use of the words 'fucking black cunt' were directed at Ferdinand by way of forceful rejection and/or inquiry. Instead, [the Commission was] quite satisfied, and [found] on the balance of probabilities, that the offending words were said by way of insult."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Terry defence 'improbable, implausible and contrived' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19842795 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=6 October 2012 |date=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Summary of the reasons for John Terry's FA ban |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19845841 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=6 October 2012 |date=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FA commission was also criticised as a "kangaroo court" and the FA for its lack of independence, for failing to disclose all evidence to the police, failing to tape record their interview with key witness [[Ashley Cole]], for lowering the required burden of proof after the incident had taken place,&lt;ref name=Conseq&gt;{{cite news |title=John Terry case highlights football's culture of abuse – now the Football Association must tackle it |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/9590803/John-Terry-case-highlights-footballs-culture-of-abuse-now-the-Football-Association-must-tackle-it.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=21 January 2013 |date=5 October 2012 |location=London |first=Paul |last=Hayward}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for punishing Terry for an offence he had already been cleared of in a criminal court,&lt;ref name=Kangaroo&gt;{{cite news |title=FA on rack over 'kangaroo court verdict' on John Terry |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/fa-on-rack-over-kangaroo-court-verdict-on-john-terry-8189767.html |newspaper=London Evening Standard |accessdate=22 October 2012 |date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Joke&gt;{{cite news |title=FA disciplinary process is 'a joke' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/fa-disciplinary-process-is-a-joke-8200705.html |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=22 October 2012 |date=7 October 2012 |location=London |first=Steve |last=Tongue}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Terry 'humiliated' by racism court case |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9754000/9754162.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=22 October 2012 |date=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contravention of its own rules, which state that verdicts in criminal cases are "presumed to be correct" unless "clear and convincing evidence" to the contrary emerges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Terry quits England after FA over-rules own regulations to pursue case |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/9562149/John-Terry-quits-England-after-FA-over-rules-own-regulations-to-pursue-case.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=21 January 2013 |date=24 September 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry's four-match ban was contrasted with [[Luis Suárez]]'s eight-match ban for racially abusing [[Patrice Evra]] (Suárez received a longer ban for using the insults repeatedly) and a 14-year-old schoolboy's five-match ban for telling a referee his name was [[Santa Claus]].&lt;ref name=Kangaroo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Joke/&gt;

On 18 October 2012, Terry decided not to appeal against the verdict and his four-match ban. He issued an apology for "the language [he] used in the game" and stated that it was "not acceptable on the football field or indeed in any walk of life." Chelsea announced that they had taken further disciplinary action against Terry while keeping the details confidential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Terry decides not to appeal against four-match ban |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19989136 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=19 October 2012 |date=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Terry and Chelsea still faced media condemnation; Terry was criticised for not directly and personally apologising to Ferdinand, while Chelsea were accused of hypocrisy and double standards by only fining Terry and not stripping him of his captaincy when they have a "zero-tolerance" approach to racism and had previously handed a life ban to a fan who racially abused former Chelsea player Didier Drogba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/premier-league-paper-round-terrys-secret-punishment-revealed-065020589.html |title=Premier League: Paper Round: Terry's 'secret punishment' revealed |publisher=Yahoo!

In ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', [[Paul Hayward]] summed up his view of the consequences of the controversial incident, that "the cost has been high. Here, three vile words muttered by Terry at Loftus Road ultimately removed Fabio Capello from the England manager's job; inflicted much distress on the Ferdinand family; brought a £45,000 fine for Rio Ferdinand for his endorsement of a "choc ice" tweet aimed at Chelsea's left-back; removed Terry from the England reckoning and shed yet more light on the fantasy world of Ashley Cole."&lt;ref name=Conseq/&gt;

===In popular culture===
Terry has been part of a popular [[meme]] picturing him taking part in great moments in history and fiction following his decision to come on to the pitch to lift the European Cup in full kit despite being suspended for the [[2012 UEFA Champions League Final]], he repeated this when Chelsea won the [[2013 UEFA Europa League Final]] which he did not play in due to injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Terry lifts trophy in full Chelsea kit |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/news/story/_/id/1449488/john-terry-lifts-europa-league-trophy-full-chelsea-kit |website=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], the freeing of [[Nelson Mandela]] and the triumph of [[Rocky Balboa]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/champions-league/internet-pranksters-target-limelightloving-john-terry-after-champions-league-win-3115491.html |title=Internet pranksters target limelight-loving John Terry after Champion's League win |newspaper=Irish Independent |location=Dublin |date=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the summer of 2012 this developed into his celebrating current sporting achievements such as [[2012 Summer Olympics]] medal wins by [[Team GB]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talksport.co.uk/magazine/virals/120910/picture-john-terry-gatecrashes-team-gb-olympic-athletes-parade-180604 Picture: John Terry gatecrashes the Team GB Olympic athletes parade | talkSPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12995">'''Land administration''' is the way in which the rules of [[land tenure]] are applied and made operational. Land administration, whether formal or informal, comprises an extensive range of systems and processes to administer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/005/Y4307E/y4307e05.htm#bm05.2 Land Tenure and Rural Development, FAO Land Tenure Studies, No 3, Rome, 2002. - 3.16 Land administration]&lt;/ref&gt; The processes of land administration include the transfer of rights in land from one party to another through sale, lease, loan, gift and inheritance; the regulating of land and property development; the use and conservation of the land; the gathering of revenues from the land through sales, leasing, and taxation; and the resolving of conflicts concerning the ownership and the use of land. Land administration functions may be divided into four components: Juridical, regulatory, fiscal, and information management. These functions of land administration may be organized in terms of agencies responsible for [[National mapping agency|surveying and mapping]], [[land registration]], and [[Land valuation#Governing authorities and professional organizations|land valuation]].&lt;ref&gt;Dale &amp; McLaughlin (1999) Land Administration. Oxford University Press, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose and scope of this knowledge domain appear from the following introducing notes:
:These Guidelines define land administration as the process whereby land and the information about land may be effectively managed. They are mainly written for senior governmental staff and politicians engaged in land administration issues. The aim is to outline the benefit of having a relevant and reliable land information system in place. The Guidelines identify the factors that should be taken into account in developing the legislation, organization, databases and maps, as well as the funding mechanisms, required to implement and maintain a solid land administration system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unece.org/index.php?id=25632 |title=Land Administration Guidelines With Special Reference to Countries in Transition |publisher=United Nations Economic Commission for Europe |date=December 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of use of the notion of land administration is a 1973 ''Seminar on Land Administration'' in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;Dale &amp; McLaughlin (1988) Land Information Management. - An introduction with special reference to cadastral problems in Third World countries. Clarendon Press, Oxford, p. 18, note 17&lt;/ref&gt; ''Land administration arrangements'' were charted in a 1985 paper by Holstein, McLaughlin, and Nichols,&lt;ref&gt;Dale &amp; McLaughlin (1988) p. 18, note 10&lt;/ref&gt; and the Department of Lands and Surveys, Western Australia changed name in 1986 to Department of Land Administration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Department of Lands and Surveys, Western Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The UNECE in 1996 published ''Land Administration Guidelines With Special Reference to Countries in Transition'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/index.php?id=25632 Land Administration Guidelines With Special Reference to Countries in Transition. December 1996.] {{ISBN|92-1-116644-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Dale &amp; McLaughlin textbook on ''Land Information Management'' from 1988 was in 1999 succeeded by the textbook ''Land Administration''.

== History ==

The practise of land administration is older than the presently used term. In ''The Cadastral Map in the Service of the State'', mention is made of [[Cadastre|cadastral survey]] and subsequent tax collection in northern part of the Netherlands, initiated by an order  in 1533.&lt;ref&gt;Roger J P Kain &amp; Elizabeth Baigent (1992) The Cadastral Map in the Service of the State - A history of property mapping. The University of Chicago press. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Other early, seventeenth century mapping for administrative purposes are found, e.g. in Sweden and in German [[Principality|principalities]]. In the duchy of Austrian Lombardy, a complete cadastral survey, the Milan cadaster, was finally adopted as a taxation base in 1760, and this provided the model for continental European countries to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Kain &amp; Baigent (1992), p. 184-185&lt;/ref&gt; Largely independent from this cadastral development, local courts recorded [[Deed#Deeds of conveyance|deeds of conveyance]]. In the context of [[Codification (law)|codification]] of national legislation, most European countries in the nineteenth century established a [[Torrens title|title system]] at the local courts. England and Wales departed from this trend, as prolonged debates during the nineteenth century left parties with optional public recording of deeds of conveyance and the locating of properties and their boundaries on large-scale topographic maps, where available, similar to the [[metes and bounds]] method.&lt;ref&gt;Kain &amp; Baigent (1992), p. 256, 275&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of [[British Raj|British India]] was covered, during the nineteenth century, by the Revenue Survey.&lt;ref&gt;Kain &amp; Baigent (1992), p. 325 f&lt;/ref&gt;

In the colony (now state) of South Australia, [[Robert Torrens]] in 1858 introduced a title system. Like the Milan cadastre, this system became a model to be followed, initially within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. In the USA, the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] established the basis for the [[Public Land Survey System]], which provides locational functions as the cadastral or - in modern terms - [[land information system]] described above. For the present adoption of the Torrens system in the USA, see Justin T. Holl, Jr. et al. (2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://grm.thomsonreuters.com/our-knowledge/2011/07/2011/12/2011/12/white-paper-the-earthen-vessel-land-records-in-the-united-states.aspx Justin T.

== International organizations ==
The domain of '''land administration''' is characterized by the engagement of [[international organization]]s as much as by its intrinsic, multi-disciplinary structure. Among [[intergovernmental organization]]s,
* The [[World Bank]] has supported land and real estate reforms across a wide range of countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.worldbank.org/A6S3NQ9PZ0 Galal, A; Razzaz, Omar (2001) Reforming land and real estate markets.

* [[UN-HABITAT]]'s section on Land, Tenure &amp; Property Administration focus on the implementation of land, housing and property rights, particularly women's secure tenure, affordable land management systems and pro-poor flexible types of tenure. The insufficient attention paid to the development of methods for implementing land policies, led to the development of pro poor land tools that are affordable and accessible for use by a variety of stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?typeid=19&amp;catid=283&amp;cid=1504 UN-HABITAT, Land &amp; Housing, Research &amp; Tool Development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119072839/http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?typeid=19&amp;catid=283&amp;cid=1504 |date=2012-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts further include the creation of the Global Land Tool Network (GLTN).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gltn.net/ The Global Land Tool Network (GLTN)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6050">The '''Legal Aid Society of Cleveland''' is a [[legal aid]] society in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] established in 1905.  It helped pioneer a nationwide legal aid movement whose leaders held to a simple but profound principle: that rich and poor alike are entitled to equal treatment under the law.

The first legal aid organization, the [[Deutscher Rechts-Schutz Verein]] (German Legal Aid Society), was incorporated in [[New York City]] in 1876 "to render legal aid and assistance, gratuitously, to those of German birth, who may appear worthy thereof, but who from poverty are unable to procure it."&lt;ref&gt;John MacArthur Maguire. ''The Lance of Justice: A Semi-Centennial History of the Legal Aid Society, 1876–1926'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1928).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chicago]]'s Ethical Culture Society formed the Bureau of Justice in 1888, which sought to provide legal services to all poor persons. This, according to a chronology of the history of legal services, was the first true legal aid organization.

In 1896, the New York society amended its charter, dropping the word "German" to become "The Legal Aid Society," and in 1899 it opened three branch offices. Following these pioneers, legal aid societies were organized in [[Boston]] (1900), [[Philadelphia]] (1902), and Cleveland (1905).&lt;ref&gt;Arthur F. Bigelow, "Epitome of Legal Aid History in the United States, 1876–1925," in "Legal Aid Work," John S. Bradway and Reginald Heber Smith, eds., special issue, Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 124 (March 1926): 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, for more than one hundred years, the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland has provided legal services to those unable to afford a lawyer. It is an organization with a remarkable story of progressive men and women working to better the lives of Cleveland's poor.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Poh Miller. ''A Passion for Justice: A History of the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland, 1905–2005'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Legal Aid in Cleveland==

Incorporated in May 1905, the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland is the fifth oldest organization of its kind in the world. In a statement of purpose published in 1906, the founders wrote, legal aid is based on the principle that justice is the right of all men, and aims to put the rich and poor on an actual equality before the law.

Two private attorneys, [[Isador Grossman]] and [[Arthur D. Baldwin]] organized Legal Aid, which was initially funded through private donations and subscriptions.  Grossman was its sole attorney from 1905 to 1912. From 1912 to 1939, Legal Aid contracted with outside law firms to provide legal services.

A focus of Legal Aid in its beginning years was working for passage of legislation aimed at unconscionable practices of businesses that preyed on low-income persons. Legal Aid's first annual report refers to a measure to regulate moneylenders who were charging poor people interest rates of 60% to 200%. A Legal Aid trustee was the principal author of a 1910 bill to create the first municipal court in Ohio. Creation of that court eventually led to the demise of the exploitive Justice of the Peace courts in the state.

Also in 1910, Legal Aid secured passage of a bill that led to creation of the world's first small claims court. The small claims court was widely imitated across the country. In 1913, Legal Aid became a charter agency of the Community Fund (now known as United Way). Under the guidance of [[Claude Clarke]] in 1919, Legal Aid saw an increase in revenue and diversity of cases, as well as the creation of beneficial relationships with the city's social welfare agencies. Towards the end of Clarke s leadership, eventually concluding in 1959, The Committee on Organization and Function urged a new plan of operation. In the early 1960s, Legal Aid stopped retaining outside lawyers and established its own staff. It became a grantee of the Office of Economic Opportunity predecessor of the Legal Services Corporation in 1966.

In 1966, under the leadership of then director and later Common Pleas Court Judge [[Burt Griffin]], Legal Aid established five offices in low-income Cleveland neighborhoods. In 1968, [[C. Lyonel Jones]] took over as director and held that position until 2005. By 1970, some 30,000 low-income residents were being serviced by 66 Legal Aid attorneys in civil, criminal and juvenile cases. 

Legal Aid has helped to eliminate racial discrimination in site selection for public housing and promotion of Cleveland police and firefighters, blocked termination of SSI and Social Security disability benefits without proper evidence, improved area jails and mental hospitals, established the right to counsel in commitment proceedings and misdemeanor cases, expanded vocational educational opportunities for [[Vietnam War]] Veterans and obtained benefits for victims of industrial air pollution. In 1977, Legal Aid prevailed in a landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision on the rights of an extended family to live together in [[Moore v. City of East Cleveland]].

Today, Legal Aid is led by executive director [[Colleen Cotter]].  Legal Aid annually handles over 8,500 civil cases that help more than 21,000 persons. Legal Aid's 55 attorneys now operate out of its [[downtown Cleveland]] office and three offices located in [[Painesville, Ohio|Painesville]], [[Jefferson, Ohio|Jefferson]], and [[Elyria, Ohio]]. The organization serves over 300,000 low-income residents of five counties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25638">[[Income tax|Taxation of income]] in the United States has been practised since colonial times. Some southern states imposed their own taxes on income from property, both before and after Independence. The [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] empowered the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] to raise taxes at a uniform rate throughout the nation, and required that "[[direct tax]]es" be imposed only in proportion to the [[Census]] population of each state. Federal income tax was first introduced under the [[Revenue Act of 1861]] to help pay for the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]]. It was renewed in later years and reformed in 1894 in the form of the [[Wilson-Gorman tariff]].

Legal challenges centered on whether the income tax then in force constituted a "direct tax". In the ''[[Springer v. United States]]'' case of 1881,&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Springer v. United States|link=|volume=102|page=586|pin=|year=1881}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court upheld the tax regime then in force. An 1894 statute was ruled unconstitutional in the case of ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Company]]''.&lt;ref name="Pollock"&gt;''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.]]'', {{ussc|157|429|1895}}, ''affirmed on rehearing'', {{ussc|158|601|1895}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]], proposed in 1909 and becoming law in 1913, cancelled the "apportionment" requirement for income taxes. Federal income tax was thereupon reintroduced in the [[Revenue Act of 1913]]. In the case of ''[[Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Company]]'' (1916),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Co.|link=|volume=240|page=1|pin=|year=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1913 Act was ruled to be constitutional. A separate [[excise tax]] was also imposed on corporations.

Subsequent legal actions were concerned with what should be counted as "income" under the 1913 Act. In ''[[Eisner v. Macomber]]'' (1920),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Eisner v. Macomber|link=|volume=252|page=189|pin=|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] ruled that proportionate [[stock dividend]]s were not taxable as income, on the grounds that the dividend income was not "severable" from the capital holding from which it was derived. Later decisions, however, have tended to limit this view of "severability," and to uphold the federal statutes as exertions of the power of Congress to tax.

==History through 1916==

===Early history===

The first attempt to [[income tax|tax income]] in the [[United States]] was in 1643 when several colonies instituted a "faculties and abilities" tax. Tax collectors would literally go door to door and ask if the individual had income during the year. If so, the tax was computed on the spot.  The income tax raised little revenue, and was viewed as a supplement to more traditional forms of [[property taxation]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward R. A. Seligman, ''The Income Tax'', p. 368 (Macmillan &amp; Co. 1911).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional provisions===

Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution (the "[[Taxing and Spending Clause]]"), specifies [[United States Congress|Congress]]'s power to impose "Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises," but Article I, Section 8 requires that, "Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec8.html US Constitution.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Constitution specifically limited Congress' ability to impose direct taxes, by requiring that direct taxes be imposed in proportion to each state's census population. It was thought that [[tax per head|head taxes]] and [[property tax]]es (slaves could be taxed as either or both) were likely to be abused, and that they bore no relation to the activities in which the federal government had a legitimate interest. The fourth clause of section 9 therefore specifies that, "No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken."

Taxation was also the subject of [[Federalist No. 33]] penned secretly by the Federalist [[Alexander Hamilton]] under the [[pseudonym]] [[Federalist Papers#Origins|Publius]]. In it, he explains that the wording of the "Necessary and Proper" clause should serve as guidelines for the legislation of laws regarding taxation. The legislative branch is to be the judge, but any abuse of those powers of judging can be overturned by the people, whether as states or as a larger group.

===Early colonial and state income taxes===

In the early 18th century and well into the 19th century, a number of the southern colonies and states adopted an income tax modeled on the tax instituted in England.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The British theory was that you tax the income from property, and not the property itself; thus, sales of property were not subject to taxation.&lt;ref&gt;Income Tax Act of 1799, 39 George III c13. This first income tax in England was instituted in 1799 by William Pitt to help finance the Napoleonic wars.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First income tax law===
In order to help pay for its war effort in the [[American Civil War]], the [[United States government]] imposed its first personal income tax, on August 5, 1861, as part of the [[Revenue Act of 1861]]. Tax rates were 3% on income exceeding $600 and less than $10,000, and 5% on income exceeding $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;Revenue Act of 1861, sec. 49, ch. 45, 12 Stat. 292, 309 (Aug. 5, 1861).&lt;/ref&gt; This tax was repealed and replaced by another income tax in the [[Revenue Act of 1862]].&lt;ref&gt;Sections 49, 51, and part of 50 repealed by Revenue Act of 1862, sec. 89, ch. 119, 12 Stat. 432, 473 (July 1, 1862); income taxes imposed under Revenue Act of 1862, section 86 (pertaining to salaries of officers, or payments to "persons in the civil, military, naval, or other employment or service of the United States ...") and section 90 (pertaining to "the annual gains, profits, or income of every person residing in the United States, whether derived from any kind of property, rents, interest, dividends, salaries, or  from any profession, trade, employment or vocation carried on in the United States or elsewhere, or from any other source whatever. ... ")&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war when the need for federal revenues decreased, Congress (in the [[Revenue Act of 1870]]) let the tax law expire in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Revenue Act of 1870, Pub. L. No. 164, 41 Cong, 2d Sess., Ch. 255 (July 14, 1870). This statute extended the income tax for only two years, 1871 and 1872.&lt;/ref&gt; However, one of the challenges to the validity of this tax reached the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 1880. In ''[[Springer v. United States]]'', the taxpayer contended that the income tax on his professional earnings and interest income on bonds violated the "direct tax" requirement of the Constitution. The Supreme Court concluded that the tax of which Mr. Springer complained (i.e. a tax on professional earnings and on interest from bonds) was within the category of an excise or duty, and was neither a capitation tax (based on population) nor a property tax. The court also concluded that direct taxes, within the meaning of the Constitution, were only capitation taxes and taxes on real estate.

===Second income tax law===

In 1894, a Democratic-led Congress passed the [[Wilson-Gorman tariff]]. This imposed the first peacetime income tax. The rate was 2% on income over $4000, which meant fewer than 10% of households would pay any. The purpose of the income tax was to make up for revenue that would be lost by tariff reductions.&lt;ref&gt;Charles F. Dunbar, "The New Income Tax," ''Quarterly Journal of Economics,'' Vol. 9, No. 1 (Oct., 1894), pp. 26-46 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1883633 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; This was a controversial provision, and the law actually passed without the signature of President [[Grover Cleveland]].&lt;ref&gt;26 Cong. Rec. 8666 (1894), as cited in Sheldon D. Pollack, "Origins of the Modern Income Tax, 1894-1913," 66 ''Tax Lawyer'' 295, at 306, Winter 2013 (Amer. Bar Ass'n).&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Direct" income tax unconstitutional: ''Pollock v. Farmers' Loan Trust Company''===

Once again, a taxpayer challenged the legality of the income tax. In ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Company]]'' (1895),&lt;ref name="Pollock"/&gt; Charles Pollock sued the corporation in which he owned stock, contending that the corporation should never have paid the income tax because the tax was unconstitutional. In this case, the tax was paid on income from land. Pollock argued that since a tax on real estate is a direct tax, a tax on the income from such property should be a direct tax as well. Because the Constitution prohibited a "[[direct tax]]" unless the tax is apportioned, Pollock argued that the unapportioned income tax should be declared unconstitutional. The "direct tax" argument had also been used by Springer in 1880, but now the Court focused more closely on the wording in the Constitution. The provisions were Article I, Section 8, Clause 1, which provides that "all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States"&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Const. Art. I, §  8, cl 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and Article I, Section 9, Clause 4, which provides: "No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Const. Art. I, §  9, cl 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In effect, the latter clause required any ''direct tax'' to be based on a census. For example, if the government desired to raise $10 million and New York had 20% of the total U.S. population at that time, then New York would be required to raise $2 million. If New York had 1 million residents, each resident would owe $2 in taxes. Obviously, a tax based on income could not achieve such proportionality, since incomes differed across individuals.

This time, the Court stated that "although there have been, from time to time, intimations that there might be some tax which was not a direct tax, nor included under the words 'duties, imposts, and excises,' such a tax, for more than 100 years of national existence, has as yet remained undiscovered, notwithstanding the stress of particular circumstances has invited thorough investigation into sources of revenue."&lt;ref name="Pollock"/&gt; In other words, the federal taxing power consists of four categories: direct taxes, duties, imposts and excises (with the latter three categories sometimes called simply "indirect taxes").

In a 5-4 decision on April 8, 1895, the Court ruled that the unapportioned income tax on income from land was unconstitutional. On May 20, 1895, the Court expanded its holding to rule that the unapportioned income tax on income from personal property (such as interest income and dividend income) was also unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="Pollock"/&gt; This decision partially overturned the ruling in ''Springer v. United States''.

The Court held that taxes on the rents or income of real estate, on personal property, or on the income of personal property (e.g. interest and dividends), were direct taxes within the meaning of the Constitution, and therefore had to be apportioned. In ''Springer'', the Court had held that direct taxes within the meaning of the Constitution were only capitation taxes and taxes on real estate. Therefore in ''Pollock'', the Court overruled a portion of the ''Springer'' decision by expanding the definition of direct taxes. The portion of the ''Springer'' decision that was not overruled by the Court in ''Pollock'' was the portion of the holding that applied to taxes on professional earnings. Since apportionment of income taxes is impractical, the Court's decision had the effect of prohibiting a federal tax on income from property. The power to tax real and personal property, or that such was a direct tax, was not denied by the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/D/1876-1900/reform/pollock.htm  Chief Justice Fuller's opinion, 158 U.S. 601, 634]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the political difficulties of taxing individual wages without taxing income from property, a federal income tax was impractical from the time of the ''Pollock'' decision until the time of ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment (below).

Thus, the 1894 tax law was ruled unconstitutional and was effectively repealed.

===Modern income tax===

In 1909, fifteen years after ''Pollock'', Congress took two actions to deal with their increasing revenue needs.

'''1. Corporate excise tax.'''  First, Congress passed a corporate excise tax. The amount of the excise was set at 1% of each corporation's income exceeding $5,000. In 1911, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld this corporate excise as constitutional in ''[[Flint v. Stone Tracy Company]]'', in which the court ruled that the tax was an excise upon the privilege of doing business in corporate form.

'''2. Sixteenth Amendment.''' More importantly, in 1909 Congress proposed the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]]. This amendment reads as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constit. amend XVI.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By February 1913, the required three-fourths of the states ratified the Sixteenth Amendment, thus adding the amendment to the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Government Printing Office]], at [http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/html/conamt.html Amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205125036/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/html/conamt.html |date=2008-02-05 }}; see generally ''United States v.

Bittker]], Constitutional Limits on the Taxing Power of the Federal Government, ''The Tax Lawyer'', Fall 1987, Vol. 41, No. 1, p. 3 ([[American Bar Association|American Bar Ass'n]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Congress enacted the [[Revenue Act of 1913]]. The tax ranged from 1% on income exceeding $3,000 to 7% on incomes exceeding $500,000.

Subsequently, the U.S. Supreme Court in 1916 upheld the constitutionality of the Revenue Act of 1913 in the case of [[Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Company]], {{ussc|240|1|1916}}.  The Court held that the Act was constitutional based on the following: 1) there was power by virtue of the Sixteenth Amendment to levy the tax without apportionment; 2) the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment is not a limitation upon Congress's taxing power; and 3) the statute did not violate the uniformity clause of Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.

==Definitions of "income"==

{{see also|Income (United States legal definitions)}}
The term "income" is not defined in the Internal Revenue Code. The closest that Congress comes to defining income is found in the definition of "gross income" in Internal Revenue Code section 61, which is largely unchanged from its predecessor, the original Section 22(a) definition of income in the Revenue Act of 1913:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sec. 22(a). "Gross income" includes gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages or compensation for personal service (including personal service as an officer or employee of a State, or any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing), of whatever kind and in whatever form paid, or from professions, vocations, trades, businesses, commerce, or sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal, growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such property; also from interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;''Revenue Act of 1913'', Pub. L. No. 16, 63rd Cong., 1st Sess., § 22(a) (1913).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Eisner v. Macomber''===

One of the earliest attempts to define income occurred in the case of [[Eisner v. Macomber]], in which the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the taxability of a proportionate stock dividend (as opposed to a monetary or cash dividend on stock). This case provided the Court with a forum to try to interpret exactly what Congress intended to include in the sparse Section 22 definition of "income." This was not the first time the Court had addressed the issue: the case had been argued in the previous term of the Court, and was being reargued with additional oral and written briefs.

The Court stated that it needed to examine the boundaries of the definition of income for several reasons. First, the [[Revenue Act of 1916]] expressly stated that a "stock dividend shall be considered income, to the amount of the cash value."&lt;ref&gt;252 U.S. at 200. See Revenue Act of 1916, Pub. L. No. 64-271, 64th Cong, § 2A (Sept. 8, 1916).&lt;/ref&gt; In a previous case, [[Towne v. Eisner]], the Court had ruled, however, that a stock dividend made in 1914 against surplus earned prior to January 1, 1913 was not taxable under the Act of October 3, 1913, which provided that net income included "dividends." The district court in that case had noted that: "It is manifest that the stock dividend in question cannot be reached by the Income Tax Act, and could not, even though Congress expressly declared it to be taxable as income, unless it is in fact income."&lt;ref&gt;''Towne v Eisner'', 242 F. 702, 704 (S.D.N.Y. 1917), ''rev'd'', 245 U.S. 418, 38 S. Ct. 158, 62 L. Ed. 372 (1918).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court had held, however, that the stock dividend was the equivalent of income. The Supreme Court in ''Towne v. Eisner'' then reversed the lower court, finding that the dividend was not income because the "proportional interest of each shareholder remains the same ... and the stockholder is no richer than they were before."&lt;ref&gt;245 U.S. at 426.
&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the Court decided in ''Eisner v. Macomber'' to address the larger constitutional question of whether or not a stock dividend was gross income within the meaning of "income" as used in the Sixteenth Amendment. As noted by the Court:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In order, therefore, that the clauses cited from Article 1 of the Constitution may have proper force and effect, save only as modified by the Amendment, and that the latter also may have proper effect it becomes essential to distinguish between what is and what is not "income" as the term is there used; and to apply the distinction, as cases arise, according to truth and substance, without regard to form. Congress cannot by any definition it may adopt conclude the matter, since it cannot by legislation alter the Constitution, from which it derives its power to legislate, and within whose limitations alone that power can be lawfully exercised.&lt;ref&gt;252 U.S. at 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a starting point, the Court defined income succinctly by reference to the dictionary and to two earlier cases &lt;ref&gt;''Stratton's Independence Ltd v Howbert'', 231 U.S. 399, 34 S. Ct. 136, 58 L. Ed. 285 (1913), and ''Doyle v. Mitchell Bros. Company'', 247 U.S. 179, 38 S. Ct. 467, 62 L. Ed. 1054 (1918).&lt;/ref&gt; as follows: "Income may be defined as the gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined, provided it be understood to include profit gained through a sale or conversion of capital assets." &lt;ref&gt;252 U.S. at 207.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court then went into a lengthy explanation as to how this definition applies to a stock dividend. In the end, the Court decided that the stock dividend was not taxable, because it was merely a book adjustment and was not "severable" from the underlying stock. In other words, income would not be realized until the stock itself was sold.

===Expansion in the definition of income===

A number of commentators contended that the Court in [[Eisner v. Macomber]] had gone too far in overturning a statute taxing stock dividends (the 1916 Act) that many perceived as being fair and equitable. [[Henry Simons]], a noted tax scholar of the time, in his treatise, observed the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Actually, an utterly trivial issue was made the occasion for injecting into our fundamental law a mass of rhetorical confusion which no orderly mind can contemplate respectfully, and for giving constitutional status to naive and ridiculous notions about the nature of income and the rationale for income taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Simons, ''Personal Income Taxation: The Definition of Income as a Problem of Fiscal Policy'', pp 198-199 (University of Chicago, 1938).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite this criticism, a number of decisions subsequent to ''Eisner v. Macomber'' relied on this simplistic definition of income. This in turn led to the question of whether or not this formulation was an "exclusive" definition of income, with any income not clearly covered by its terms deemed to be nontaxable.

In ''Hawkins v. Commissioner'', the [[Internal Revenue Service]] argued that compensatory damages received by the taxpayer by way of settlement of a suit for injury to personal reputation and health caused by defamatory statements constituting libel or slander were taxable. While noting that "there may be cases in which taxable income will be judicially found although outside the precise scope of the description already given," the Board of Tax Appeals concluded that such damages would not be taxable. The Board noted that the injury was "wholly personal and nonpecuniary," and that the remedy simply attempts to make the individual whole.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkins v. Commissioner, 6 B.T.A.'' 1023 (1927), at [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=%22Hawkins%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,55&amp;case=8904102598539766478&amp;scilh=0].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even though the payment was "severable" and lead to a demonstrable increase in net wealth, the Board nonetheless concluded that the payment was not income.

Other commentators noted that if "severability" were to be considered a touchstone for the definition of income, it followed that a number of sales or exchanges of property that did not involve immediate realization through severance would not be taxable.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph T Sneed, "The Configurations of Gross Income," p. 71 (Columbus: Ohio State University Press 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that the "one size fits all" definition of income in ''Eisner v. Macomber'' was too broad, the U.S. Supreme Court reconsidered the idea of severability in [[Helvering v. Bruun]].&lt;ref&gt;309 U.S. 461, 60 S. Ct. 631, 84 L. Ed. 864 (1940).&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the Court addressed the question of whether or not a lessor recognizes income from the receipt of a leasehold improvement made by a lessee during the lease when the improvement reverts to the lessor at the end of the lease. In ruling that the value of the improvement was taxable, the Court noted that not every gain need be realized in cash to be taxable. There was a clear increase in the taxpayer's wealth, and this increase did not have to be severed to recognize such increase as income for federal income tax purposes.&lt;ref&gt;309 U.S. at 469.&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent cases, the U.S. Supreme Court distanced itself further from the ''Eisner v. Macomber'' definition of income and dependence of that definition on the concept of severability. For example, in ''[[Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co.]]'', the Court ruled that punitive damages recovered under a violation of anti-trust laws were included in gross income, and that the language of Section 22 (now Internal Revenue Code Section 61) clearly showed the intent of Congress to exert "the full measure of its taxing power."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co.|link=|volume=348|page=426|pin=429|year=1955}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In referencing its previous definition of income in ''Eisner v. Macomber'', the Court noted that "in distinguishing gain from capital, the definition had served a useful purpose. But it was not meant to provide a touchstone to all future gross income questions."&lt;ref&gt;''Glenshaw Glass Co.'', 348 U.S. at 431.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] gained [[Indian independence movement|independence]] in 1947, the [[All-India Muslim League]]  and its successor [[Muslim League (Pakistan)|Muslim League]] has seen a steady number of splits and breakaway factions. Some of the breakaway organisations have thrived as [[Independent (politician)|independent]] parties, some have become [[wikt:Defunct|defunct]], while others have merged with the parent party or other  political parties. The All-India Muslim League was dissolved in 1947 after the partition. Muslim League (Pakistan) was dissolved in 1958 (by martial law).

'''Mitzvah Day International''' is an annual day of faith-based social action that takes place in November each year, primarily in the [[United Kingdom]]. On Mitzvah Day each year, community groups and individuals undertake a range of [[Volunteering|volunteer]] projects for those in need in their local community. Organizations register with Mitzvah Day, which in turn helps match volunteers with local projects. The objective is to encourage people to give their time, rather than their money, to worthwhile local causes, whilst also creating deeper linkages within communities and supporting charities. In 2013, close to 30,000 people participated in Mitzvah Day around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=2013-11-19 |title=In Pictures: Mitzvah Day 2013 |url=http://jewishnews.co.uk/in-pictures-mitzvah-day-2013/ |newspaper=Hendon &amp; Finchley Times |location= |publisher=Times Series |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Though based within the [[British Jews|UK's Jewish Community]], Mitzvah Day traditionally marks the first day of UK National Inter Faith Week,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interfaithweek.org/index.php/events/events/extended-list-test?viewid=16&amp;vmode=d&amp;date=2013-11-17 |title=UK Inter Faith Week: Events for Sunday, November 17, 2013 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2013-11-17 |website=Inter Faith Week |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result has expanded to include participants from other faith communities as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Slater |first=Anna |date=2013-11-15 |title=Interfaith Mitzvah Day project in Whetstone |url=http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/10812704.Interfaith_Mitzvah_Day_project/ |newspaper=Hendon &amp; Finchley Times |location= |publisher=Times Series |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Halkon |first=Ruth |date=2013-11-06 |title=Mitzvah Day and National Interfaith Week events in Aldenham and Radlett |url=http://www.borehamwoodtimes.co.uk/news/10790049.Gathering_together_to_make_the_community_better/ |newspaper=Borehamwood &amp; Elstree Times |location= |publisher=Times Series |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
'[[Mitzvah]]' is the Hebrew biblical term for 'deed' or '[[613 mitzvot|commandment]]', which has come to mean 'good deed' or 'charitable act' in contemporary [[English Language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mitzvah |title=Mitzvah: definition |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Miriam Webster Dictionary |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 date is November 19.&lt;ref&gt;http://mitzvahday.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Mitzvah Day International was founded by Laura Marks in 2005, who, upon returning to her native UK from a period spent in [[Los Angeles]], decided to bring the 'Mitzvah Day' concept she became familiar with through the [[Temple Israel of Hollywood]] [[synagogue]] back to the UK. Though the Mitzvah Day she was familiar with (and most Mitzvah Days in the US) was based around a single community or [[Synagogue|congregation]], her concept for Mitzvah Day in the UK was to unite Jewish community and other groups around a single coordinated day of social action across the country. Mitzvah Day was originally associated with the [[Jewish Community Centre for London]], and became registered as an independent charity in the United Kingdom in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mitzvahday.org.uk/about-us.html |title=About Us |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Mitzvah Day |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Endorsements ==
Mitzvah Day has been publicly endorsed by many public figures in the United Kingdom, including [[UK Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]],&lt;ref name=threeleaders&gt;{{cite news |last=Sharma |first=Suruchi |date=2011-11-11 |title=Three main party leaders back Mitzvah Day |url=http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/mitzvah/9359755.Three_main_party_leaders_back_Mitzvah_Day/ |newspaper=Hendon &amp; Finchley Times |location= |publisher=Times Series |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] and [[Leader of the Liberal Democrats|Leader]] of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] [[Nick Clegg]],&lt;ref name=threeleaders /&gt; [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[Ed Miliband]]&lt;ref name=threeleaders /&gt; Former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wolfisz |first=Francine |date=2010-11-19 |title=Tony Blair praises Mitzvah Day for "building bridges" between faiths |url=http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/mitzvah/8676992.Tony_Blair_praises_Mitzvah_Day_for__building_bridges__between_faiths/ |newspaper=Hendon &amp; Finchley Times |location= |publisher=Times Series |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blair |first=Tony |date=2010-11-18 |title=Faiths come together in joint action |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/nov/18/tony-blair-mitzvah-day |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |publisher= |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[London Mayor]] [[Boris Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=2011-11-21 |title=Boris Johnson's Mitzvah Day message |url=http://www.thejc.com/videos/news-videos/boris-johnsons-mitzvah-day-message |newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle |location=London |publisher= |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom]] [[Jonathan Sacks]], and [[The Archbishop of Canterbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Welby |first=Justin |date=2013-11-15 |title=As Archbishop of Canterbury, I'm a Mitzvah Day fan |url=http://www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/comment/113231/as-archbishop-canterbury-im-a-mitzvah-day-fan |newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle |location=London |publisher= |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mitzvahday.org.uk/awards-and-endorsements.html |title=Awards and Endorsements |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Mitzvah Day International |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won a Prime Minister's [[Big Society]] Award in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigsocietyawards.org/award-winners/mitzvah-day/ |title=Big Society Award Winners: 2013 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Big Society Awards |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mitzvah-day-wins-prime-ministers-big-society-award |title=Mitzvah Day wins Prime Minister's Big Society Award |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2011-11-30 |website=Big Society Awards, Press Release |publisher=Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Headquartered in [[London]], UK, the event has since spread to include participation from many international partners, primarily in [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Israel]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], and [[Southern Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mitzvahday.org.uk/around-the-world.html |title=Mitzvah Day Around The World |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2011-11-30 |website=Mitzvah Day International |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the name of the organization officially changed from 'Mitzvah Day' to 'Mitzvah Day International' to reflect the growing participation of community groups outside the UK.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3602">The '''Nairobi International Convention on the Removal of Wrecks''' is a 2007 [[international treaty|treaty]] of the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO).

The purpose of the convention is to establish uniform rules for the prompt and effective removal of [[shipwreck]]s located in the [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) of a state that may be hazardous to navigation or to the environment. The convention gives states authority to remove wrecks from the portion of its EEZ that is within [[international waters]] without any implication that the state is claiming sovereignty over that area.

The convention was concluded at [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], on 18 May 2007. It entered into force on 14 April 2015 after being ratified by ten states.&lt;ref name="States parties"/&gt;

== States parties ==
As of November 2018, the Convention has been ratified by 41 states.&lt;ref name="States parties"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.imo.org/en/About/Conventions/StatusOfConventions/Documents/Status%20-%202016.pdf |title=Status of multilateral Conventions and instruments in respect of which the International Maritime Organization or its Secretary-General performs depositary or other functions |publisher=International Maritime Organization |format=PDF |date=2016-10-10 |accessdate=2016-10-27 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Net.wars''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book by [[journalist]] [[Wendy M. Grossman]] about conflict and controversy among stakeholders on the [[Internet]]. It was published by [[NYU Press]] in 1997, and was simultaneously made available free as an online version. The book discusses conflicts which arose during the growth of the Internet from 1993 through 1997, labeled by Grossman as "boundary disputes". These disputes deal with issues including  [[privacy]], [[encryption]], [[copyright]], [[censorship]], [[sex]], and [[pornography]]. The author discusses history of organizations in their attempts to enforce their [[intellectual property]] on the Internet, against individuals who attempted to reveal confidential materials asserting it was in the [[public interest]]. Grossman frames these disputes with respect to overarching rights of [[freedom of speech]] and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

The book received a positive reception, and was described by ''[[Technology Review]]'' as "one of the first comprehensive reports on the upheavals underway in [[cyberspace]]."&lt;ref name="mit" /&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' praised the depth of discussion in the book,&lt;ref name="publishers" /&gt; and ''[[Library Journal]]'' commented positively on the history and background imparted.&lt;ref name="libraryjournal" /&gt; ''[[New Scientist]]'' gave the book a favorable review, commenting, "Here at last is a sensible, thought-provoking and informative book about the complexity and challenges of the Net."&lt;ref name="newscientist" /&gt; ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine observed, "Grossman has written an intriguing account of the Internet's partial fulfillment of its seemingly limitless promise."&lt;ref name="reason" /&gt;

==Publication history==
[[File:Wendyg97.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wendy M. Grossman]] (1997)]]
Prior to the book's publication, the author was recognized in 1996 with an award from the [[American Society of Journalists and Authors]] for an article in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine about conflict on the Internet.&lt;ref name="libraryjournal" /&gt; ''Net.wars'' was published in book format by [[NYU Press]] in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{oclc|476663198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{oclc|37451759}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LCCN|97021214}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to an edition in a computer file format.&lt;ref&gt;{{oclc|80536390}}&lt;/ref&gt; NYU Press made the text of the book available for free via its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nyupress.org/netwars/ |accessdate=2011-01-26|title=Net.wars - Wendy M. Grossman|work=NYUpress.org|publisher=[[NYU Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The book discusses the changes online citizens saw take place on the [[Internet]] during the period in the intervening years between 1993 and 1997.&lt;ref name="mit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reason" /&gt; Grossman labels the conflict which took place during this time as "boundary disputes".&lt;ref name="mit" /&gt; These "boundary disputes" included issues involving [[privacy]], [[encryption]], [[copyright]], [[censorship]], [[sex]], and [[pornography]].&lt;ref name="mit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="booklist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="choice" /&gt; She describes these conflicts as taking place, "along the border between cyberspace and real life".&lt;ref name="booklist" /&gt; Grossman attributes this conflict to "the Net's convulsions over the years 1993 to 1996, as it tried to assimilate huge numbers of new users who didn't share the culture that had been developing over the previous decade".&lt;ref name="reason" /&gt; The author acknowledges that she is a "[[Netizen]]", and questions her own objective stance due to this involvement.&lt;ref name="mit" /&gt;

Grossman informs the reader that she appreciates "the fact that in this age of polite political correctness there is a place in the world where people feel free to speak their minds, even offensively".&lt;ref name="mit" /&gt; She gives an analogy for the reader regarding those who would discuss and comment on the phenomenon of the Internet-based community without prior experience: "Journalists who don't use the Net themselves routinely make such egregious technological and cultural errors that you can only compare the results to what would happen if they were assigned to write about the interstate highway system based on their experiences at sea.... [I]f the police told you that prostitutes routinely and openly solicited truckers and other visitors to roadside rest areas and that therefore they were risky places for families to visit, you would probably believe them and write the story.... At the same time, after a while it's easy to lose perspective and forget that behavior which is common and tolerated on the Net seems shocking to newcomers."&lt;ref name="reason" /&gt;

The author states her desire for the Internet to remain an open community, "I would like to see the freedom of the old net.culture survive in the face of the many competing commercial and regulatory interests that might prefer to limit its reach and openness."&lt;ref name="reason" /&gt; The book delves into specific examples of organizations which attempted to enforce their perceived [[intellectual property]] from being distributed to websites on the Internet, as balanced against the ability of people participating in an online community to bring previously confidential material to light whilst stating it serves the [[public interest]] to do so.&lt;ref name="mit" /&gt; She recounts activism by Internet users against the [[Communications Decency Act]], which was ultimately deemed [[unconstitutional]] by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].&lt;ref name="reason" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kirkus"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|title=Net.wars|date=November 1997|url=http://www.nyupress.org/netwars/reviews/reviews.html#kirkus|accessdate=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grossman includes a discussion of participation in online discussion on the Internet with respect to the rights of [[freedom of speech]] and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="publishers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newscientist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="choice" /&gt;

==Reception==
Writing for the ''[[Technology Review]]'' of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], Wade Roush called the book, "one of the first comprehensive reports on the upheavals underway in cyberspace."&lt;ref name="mit"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Technology Review|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]|title=Net.wars|location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]|date=May 1998|volume=101|issue=3|page=80|last=Roush|first=Wade|issn=1096-3715}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roush commented on the author's writing style, "Grossman writes plainly yet entertainingly, providing a pleasant antidote to the breathless rhetoric one finds in many books and magazines devoted to computer culture."&lt;ref name="mit" /&gt; The review concluded, "But what ties the book together is Grossman's demonstration that the boundary disputes have more to do with power than with decency or etiquette. The Net gives all its users a vastly increased power to communicate. How much of this power, she asks, will average users be allowed to keep?"&lt;ref name="mit" /&gt;

Donna Seaman of ''[[Booklist]]'' wrote that Grossman, "vividly describes the virtual realm as a place of interconnecting communities every bit as complicated, exciting, and dangerous as any city."&lt;ref name="booklist"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Booklist]]|volume=94|date=December 1, 1997|page=596|location=United States|last=Seaman|first=Donna|title=Net.wars|issn=0006-7385|url=http://www.nyupress.org/netwars/reviews/reviews.html#booklist|accessdate=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seaman concluded, "As Grossman relates Net lore and history, she traces its transformation from a textual, academic medium into a graphics-heavy promotional bonanza, a development that has caused the online population to double over the past three years to nearly 60 million users."&lt;ref name="booklist" /&gt; In a review for ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]]'', C. Koch characterized the work, "This book is in the form of a series of explorations of various instances of such problems and how they can be seen to relate to matters of undesirable curtailment of free speech and to the more positive potential of the Net to foster new Net communities."&lt;ref name="choice"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]]|last=Koch|first=C.|title=Net.wars|volume=35|issue=10|date=June 1998|page=1744|location=United States|issn=0009-4978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koch wrote of the author's writing style, "The book is a bit rambling in style, but those committed to the value of open Net community may find it pleasantly reflective."&lt;ref name="choice" /&gt;

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' reviewed the book and recommended it for multiple types of readers, "Both newbies (newcomers to the Internet) and Netizens (old-timers) will find challenges and rewards in this witty, knowledgeable and timely report from the electronic front."&lt;ref name="publishers"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Publishers Weekly]]|date=December 1997|title=Net.wars|url=http://www.nyupress.org/netwars/reviews/reviews.html#pw|accessdate=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Publishers Weekly'' wrote positively of the amount of detail included in the book's discussion, "Journalist Grossman covers in considerable depth the battles now raging over the First Amendment rights, security, privacy and general standards of conduct in cyberspace."&lt;ref name="publishers" /&gt; ''[[Library Journal]]'' wrote of the success of the author's argumentation, "Grossman sets out to answer questions about the future of the Internet and how it will be regulated. She does a fine job of explaining the issues and the background behind online controversies".&lt;ref name="libraryjournal"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Library Journal]]|last=Accardi|first=Joe|volume=122|date=December 1997|page=134|location=United States|issn=0363-0277|title=Net.wars|url=http://www.nyupress.org/netwars/reviews/reviews.html#lib|accessdate=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Library Journal'' commented on Grossman's viewpoint, "Her approach is one of informed skepticism".&lt;ref name="libraryjournal" /&gt;

{{quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=right |halig=left | salign=right|quote="Here at last is a sensible, thought-provoking and informative book about the complexity and challenges of the Net. " |source=&amp;nbsp;—''[[New Scientist]]''&lt;ref name="newscientist" /&gt;}}
Harold Thimbleby of ''[[New Scientist]]'' gave the book a positive review, writing, "Here at last is a sensible, thought-provoking and informative book about the complexity and challenges of the Net."&lt;ref name="newscientist"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[New Scientist]]|last=Thimbleby|first=Harold|volume=157|issue=2117|date=January 17, 1998|page=43|location=Great Britain|issn=0262-4079|title=Net.wars}}&lt;/ref&gt; He compared Grossman's writing to other works on the subject matter, "Most books are too enthusiastic about the technology, too American, too Utopian, too get-rich-quick—or just out of date. In ''Net.wars'' we have a good, profoundly challenging book, which rises above parochialism. It is full of insights—as much into bulletin boards as sexual stereotyping, rights to free speech and establishing global copyright."&lt;ref name="newscientist" /&gt; Thimbleby concluded, "Everyone, particularly police, lawyers, teachers, parents and scientists, can usefully read this book and consider what the Net really means for us all."&lt;ref name="newscientist" /&gt;

In a review for ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'', [[Nick Gillespie]] described the book as, "a nuanced map to the latest 'place' to inspire grand utopian thinking: the Internet, that ethereal and increasingly important worldwide network of computer networks."&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]|last=Gillespie|first=Nick|volume=30|issue=2|date=June 1998|pages=67–69|issn=0048-6906|location=United States|title=Net.wars}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gillespie wrote positively of the author's breadth of knowledge and experience about the subject matter, "An American journalist living in London, Grossman brings a wealth of professional and personal experience to the material—and a clarity of style and analysis that is a welcome relief from both the hyperbolic prose of many Net boosters and the overwrought jeremiads of cyberphobes."&lt;ref name="reason" /&gt; His review concluded, "the great virtue of net.wars is its recognition that cyberspace's utopian potential—its ability to enrich existing real communities while creating new, virtual ones—is directly tied to its ability to change, grow, and make itself useful to its inhabitants. In showing how that process works in both historical and cultural terms, Grossman has written an intriguing account of the Internet's partial fulfillment of its seemingly limitless promise."&lt;ref name="reason" /&gt;

''[[The Village Voice]]'' pointed out the decision of publisher [[NYU Press]] to publish the book's contents online, noting, "Risking profits for the sake of progress, NYU Press has decided to publish journalist Wendy Grossman's canny new book, net.wars, simultaneously in print and in a free online version ... For NYU, it's a big gamble for publicity."&lt;ref name="villagevoice"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Village Voice]]|publisher=[[Village Voice Media]]|title=Free for All|date=January 20, 1998|url=http://www.nyupress.org/netwars/reviews/reviews.html#village|accessdate=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review observed that the nature of the book's format was appropriate for online distribution, "the online design of net.wars points to an even more dramatic literary evolution. Net.wars, with over 500 hypertext links, is truly more Web site than book, and it unquestionably belongs online."&lt;ref name="villagevoice" /&gt; In its review of her book, ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' pointed out a paradox regarding one of Grossman's proposed solutions to issues of encroachment upon [[Internet censorship|Internet freedoms]].&lt;ref name="kirkus" /&gt; ''Kirkus Reviews'' noted, "Unfortunately, the solutions that Grossman suggests, while more politically moderate than those suggested by others, seem to subvert the true purpose of the Internet. She suggests smaller, more manageable virtual communities, whereas the Internet, in theory, is supposed to link all corners of the world."&lt;ref name="kirkus" /&gt; The review concluded, "At least Grossman is offering solutions, however, which is what distinguishes ''net.wars'' from most contribution on this seemingly inexhaustible topic."&lt;ref name="kirkus" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6620">The '''northwesternmost point of the [[Lake of the Woods]]''' was a critical landmark for the boundary between U.S. territory and the British possessions to the north. This point was referred to in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Paris Peace Treaty of 1783 |publisher= University of Oklahoma College of Law |url= http://www.law.ou.edu/ushistory/paris.shtml |year= 2009 |accessdate= 28 Oct 2009 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085017/http://www.law.ou.edu/ushistory/paris.shtml |archivedate= 2008-09-29 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in later treaties including the [[Anglo-American Convention of 1818|Treaty of 1818]]. This point lies at the corner of the [[Northwest Angle]] of [[Minnesota]] and is thus the northernmost point in the lower 48 United States.  After [[Canadian Confederation]], the point became the basis for the border between [[Manitoba]] and [[Ontario]].

[[File:NorthwesternPointLakeoftheWoods.svg|thumb|right|200px|Example demonstrating how the most northwest point of the Lake of the Woods was determined]]

The "northwesternmost point" of the lake had not yet been identified when it was referenced in treaties defining the border between the US and Britain; it was simply an easily described abstraction based on a large landmark. The best maps at the time of the original negotiation depicted the lake as a simple oval.&lt;ref name="low"/&gt; However, although the southern portion of the lake is easily mapped, to the north it becomes a complex tangle of bays, peninsulas, and islands, with many adjacent bodies of water separated or connected by narrow [[isthmus]]es or [[strait]]s.  An 1822 survey crew declared the referenced point impossible to determine.&lt;ref name="low"/&gt;  In 1824, British explorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] was hired to identify it. Thompson mapped the lake and found four possibilities, but did not conclusively declare one location.&lt;ref name="low"&gt;{{cite web |author= Lori Nelson |title=Drawing the Line… The Canada-U.S. Border |url= http://www.lakeofthewoods.com/2008/12/29/drawing-the-line-the-canada-us-border/ |accessdate=15 Oct 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1825, British astronomer Dr. Johann Tiarks surveyed the lake. Tiarks identified two possibilities for the northwesternmost point on the lake, based on Thompson's maps: the [[Angle Inlet]] and [[Rat Portage]]. To determine which point was the most northwestern, he drew a line from each point in the southwest-northeast direction. If the line intersected the lake at any point, it was not the most northwestern point, as shown in the example diagram here. Tiarks determined that the only such line that did not intersect the lake was at the edge of a pond on the Angle Inlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William E. Lass |title=Minnesota's Boundary with Canada: Its Evolution Since 1783 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wXAu-xA3y3gC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=minnesota%27s+boundary+with+canada&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aadvTsFGBH&amp;sig=lWD8G5DGUxpwWN0dKRrAr1GiX-A&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6IPYSoWRCIPg8Qb2v823BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=tiarks%20northwestern%20point%20thompson&amp;f=false |page=48 |publisher= Minnesota Historical Society Press |year=1980 |ISBN= 0-87351-153-0 |accessdate= 15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A 1940 academic study documents this point as being in the immediate vicinity of {{coord|49|23|51.324|N|95|9|12.20783|W}} (NAD83).)&lt;ref name ="Boggs"&gt;{{cite book |last = Boggs |first = Samuel Whittemore |publisher = Columbia University Press| year=1940 |pages=48–49| accessdate = 2013-04-27| title = International boundaries: a study of boundary functions and problems |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=REEOAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22columbia+university+press%22+%22boundaries+in+lakes%22&amp;q=northwesternmost#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.acls-aatc.ca/files/english/books/5.1.jpg |title= Map of the vicinity of the northwesternmost point of Lake of the Woods |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the 1783 treaty, the international border would have run due west from this point to the [[Mississippi River]].  As this was determined to be geographically impossible (the Mississippi begins further south), under the 1818 treaty the international border instead ran from the point determined by Tiarks, to the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]].  (It was not known at the time whether that was to the north or – in fact – the south.)&lt;ref name="low"/&gt;  From there it ran due west to the [[Rocky Mountains]] (and later, the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast).

Tiarks' point, however, created problems, because the 1818 treaty called for the border to run directly north–south from it.  South of that point, the channel of the Northwest Angle Inlet meandered east and west, crossing the border five times, thereby creating two small [[List of enclaves and exclaves#National level 5|enclaves]] of water areas totaling two and a half acres that belonged to the United States but were surrounded by Canadian waters.  A 1925 treaty addressed this by adopting the southernmost of the points where the channel and the border intersected – approximately {{cvt|5000|ft|m}} south of Tiarks' point – as the new "northwesternmost point".&lt;ref name ="Boggs"/&gt;  The new northwesternmost point thus became {{coord|49|23|4.14|N|95|9|11.34|W}}, based on the [[NAD27]] datum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |page=332| title=Joint Report upon the Survey and Demarcation of the Boundary between the United States and Canada from the Gulf of Georgia to the Northwesternmost Point of Lake of the Woods | author=International Boundary Commission | year=1937 | url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015027937153}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is equivalent to {{coord|49|23|4.12373|N|95|9|12.20783|W}} under the modern [[NAD83]] datum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/nadcon.prl |title= North American Datum Conversion, NAD 27 to NAD 83, NADCON Program Version 2.11 |accessdate=2013-10-28| author= United States National Geodetic Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Protected computers''' is a term used in Title 18, Section 1030 of the [[United States Code]], (the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]]) which prohibits a number of different kinds of conduct, generally involving unauthorized access to, or damage to the data stored on, "protected computers".  The statute, as amended by the [[National Information Infrastructure Protection Act]] of 1996,&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=104_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ294.pdf Pub. L. No. 104-294], 110 Stat. 3491-3494.&lt;/ref&gt; defines "protected computers" (formerly known as "federal interest computers") as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;a computer—&lt;br/&gt;
(A) exclusively for the use of a financial institution or the United States Government, or, in the case of a computer not exclusively for such use, used by or for a financial institution or the United States Government and the conduct constituting the offense affects that use by or for the financial institution or the Government; or&lt;br/&gt;
(B) which is used in [[interstate commerce|interstate or foreign commerce]] or communication, including a computer located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C. &amp;sect; 1030(e)(2) (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The law prohibits unauthorized obtaining of "information from any protected computer if the conduct involved an interstate or foreign communication,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/pdf/2006/2006usc18.pdf 18 U.S.C.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015075051/http://uscode.house.gov/pdf/2006/2006usc18.pdf |date=2008-10-15 }} &amp;sect; 1030(a)(2).&lt;/ref&gt; and makes it a felony&lt;ref&gt;''See'' 18 U.S.C. &amp;sect; 1030(a)(5); 18 U.S.C. § 3559.&lt;/ref&gt; to intentionally transmit malware to a protected computer if more than $5000 in damage (such as to the integrity of data) were to result.

==Scope==
The [[United States Department of Justice|U. S. Justice Department]] explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the 1994 amendments ''(of the National Information Infrastructure Act)'', the reach of this subsection ''(E. Subsection 1030(a)(5))'' was broadened by replacing the term "federal interest computer" with the term "computer used in interstate commerce or communications." The latter term is broader because the old definition of "federal interest computer" in 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(2)(B) covered a computer "which is one of two or more computers used in committing the offense, not all of which are located in the same State." This meant that a hacker who attacked other computers in the same state was not subject to federal jurisdiction, even when these actions may have severely affected interstate or foreign commerce. For example, individuals who attack telephone switches may disrupt interstate and foreign calls. The 1994 change remedied that defect.

However, the definition of federal interest computer actually covered more than simply interstate activity. More specifically, 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(2)(A) covered, generically, computers belonging to the United States Government or financial institutions, or those used by such entities on a non-exclusive basis if the conduct constituting the offense affected the Government's operation or the financial institution's operation of such computer. By changing § 1030(a)(5) from "federal interest computer" to "computer used in interstate commerce or communications," Congress may have inadvertently eliminated federal protection for those government and financial institution computers not used in interstate communications. For example, the integrity and availability of classified information contained in an intrastate local area network may not have been protected under the 1994 version of 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5), although its confidentiality continued to be protected under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(1). To remedy this situation in the 1996 Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5) was redrafted to cover any "protected computer," a new term defined in § 1030(e)(2) and used throughout the new statute--in § 1030(a)(5), as well as in §§ 1030(a)(2), (a)(4), and the new (a)(7). The definition of "protected computer" includes government computers, financial institution computers, and any computer "which is used in interstate or foreign commerce or communications."

This broad definition addresses the original concerns regarding intrastate "phone phreakers" (i.e., hackers who penetrate telecommunications computers). It also specifically includes those computers used in "foreign" communications. With the continually expanding global information infrastructure, with numerous instances of international hacking, and with the growing possibility of increased global industrial espionage, it is important that the United States have jurisdiction over international computer crime cases. Arguably, the old definition of "federal interest computer" contained in 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(2) conferred such jurisdiction because the requirement that the computers used in committing the offense not all be located in the same state might be satisfied if one computer were located overseas. As a general rule, however, Congress's laws have been presumed to be domestic in scope only, absent a specific grant of extraterritorial jurisdiction. E.E.O.C. v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244 (1991). To ensure clarity, the statute was amended to reference international communications explicitly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cybercrime.gov/1030analysis.html Cybercrime.gov THE NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION ACT OF 1996] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104055346/http://www.cybercrime.gov/1030analysis.html |date=2007-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Relinquishment of United States nationality''' is the process under [[United States federal law|federal law]] by which a [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizen or national]] voluntarily and intentionally gives up that status and becomes an [[alien (law)|alien]] with respect to the United States. In U.S. law, '''renunciation of United States citizenship''' is a [[term of art|legal term]] encompassing two specific procedures for giving up U.S. citizenship by swearing an oath of renunciation before a designated U.S. government official, but the five other acts by which an American may give up U.S. citizenship are sometimes also informally referred to as "[[renunciation of citizenship]]". Relinquishment is distinct from [[denaturalization]], which in U.S. law refers solely to cancellation of illegally procured [[naturalization]].

[[List of former United States citizens who relinquished their nationality|People who relinquish U.S. citizenship]] generally have lived abroad for many years, and nearly all of them are citizens of another country. Unlike most other countries, the U.S. does not prohibit its citizens from making themselves [[statelessness|stateless]], but the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] strongly recommends against it, and very few choose to do so. It is usually impossible to relinquish citizenship while in [[United States territory|U.S. territory]], and courts have rejected arguments that U.S. state citizenship or [[Puerto Rican citizenship]] give an ex-U.S. citizen the right to enter or reside in the U.S. without the permission of the U.S. government. Like any other foreigner or stateless person, an ex-U.S. citizen requires permission from the U.S. government, such as a [[visa policy of the United States|U.S. visa]] or [[Visa Waiver Program|visa waiver]], in order to visit the United States.

Relinquishment of U.S. citizenship remains uncommon in absolute terms, but has become more frequent than relinquishment of the citizenship of most other developed countries. Between five and six thousand U.S. citizens relinquished citizenship each year in 2015 and 2016, compared to estimates of anywhere between three million and nine million [[American diaspora|U.S. citizens residing abroad]]. The number of relinquishments is up sharply from lows in the 1990s and 2000s, though only about three times as high as in the 1970s. Lawyers believe this growth is mostly driven by [[accidental American]]s who grew up abroad and only became aware of their U.S. citizenship and the tax liabilities for citizens abroad due to ongoing publicity surrounding the 2010 [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act]].

{{USCSub|8|1481|a}} explicitly lists '''potentially expatriating acts''' by which one can relinquish U.S. citizenship, such as naturalizing in a foreign country or serving in its government or military. Congress first defined a list of potentially expatriating acts [[Expatriation Act of 1907|in 1907]], and then expanded that list greatly [[Nationality Act of 1940|in 1940]] as part of a general reform of U.S. nationality law. Originally, the executive branch regarded voluntary performance of those acts as proving intent to relinquish citizenship, even if the individual wished to retain citizenship. The Supreme Court held this to violate the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in a series of cases beginning in the 1960s, and instead required that intent to relinquish citizenship must be demonstrated by the individual's words or actions. Though in some later cases in the 1980s the State Department was able to prove the requisite intent over the protests of the individuals involved, in 1990, the State Department adopted the administrative [[presumption]] that people performing most of those acts do not intend to give up citizenship.

As a result of these court rulings and policy changes, performance of a potentially expatriating act no longer creates a risk of unintentional loss of U.S. citizenship. Instead, an individual who commits a potentially expatriating act may decide whether to retain or relinquish U.S. citizenship. In the latter case, the individual may apply to the State Department for a [[Certificate of Loss of Nationality]]. Between 2010 and 2015 that began to become a difficult process with high barriers, including nearly year-long waitlists for appointments and the world's most expensive administrative fee, as well as [[#Taxation|complicated tax treatment]]. Legal scholars state that such barriers may constitute a breach of the United States' obligations under international law, and foreign legislatures have called upon the U.S. government to eliminate the fees, taxes, and other requirements, particularly with regard to accidental Americans who have few genuine links to the United States.

==Terminology==
In general, "[[loss of citizenship]]" is a blanket term which may include both voluntary (citizen-initiated) and involuntary (government-initiated) termination of citizenship, though it is not always easy to make a clean distinction between the two categories: automatic loss of citizenship due to an initial action performed voluntarily could be seen either as "voluntary loss" or "involuntary loss".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://eudo-citizenship.eu/docs/policy_brief_loss.pdf|first=Gerard René|last=De Groot|first2=Maarten|last2=Vink|first3=Iseult|last3=Honohan|title=Loss of Citizenship|journal=EUDO Citizenship Policy Brief|issue=3|year=2013|accessdate=2013-12-14|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizen-initiated termination of citizenship may be referred to as "renunciation", "relinquishment", or "expatriation", while the term "denationalization" refers to government-initiated termination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|De Groot|Vink|Honohan|2013|p=2}} and {{cite journal|url=http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1298&amp;context=clevstlrev|first=Nora|last=Graham|title=Patriot Act II and Denationalization: An Unconstitutional Attempt to Revive Stripping Americans of Their Citizenship|journal=Cleveland State Law Review|volume=52|page=593, 596|date=2004|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In U.S. law, "relinquishment" and "renunciation" are terms used in Subchapter III, Part 3 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 ({{USC|8|1481|1489}}). The term "expatriation" was used in the initial version of that act ({{USStat|66|163}}, 268) up until the Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1986, when it was replaced by "relinquishment".&lt;ref name="INAA1986"&gt;{{USBill|99|HR|4444}}; {{USPL|99|653}}; {{USStat|100|3655}}.

Relinquishment of United States nationality encompasses relinquishment of United States citizenship. "Nationality" and "citizenship" are distinct under U.S. law: all people with U.S. citizenship also have U.S. nationality, but [[American Samoa]]ns and some residents of the [[Northern Marianas Islands]] have U.S. nationality without citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=https://fam.state.gov/fam/07fam/07fam1120.html|chapter=7 FAM 1220: Acquisition of U.S. nationality in U.S. territories and possessions|title=Foreign Affairs Manual|publisher=Department of State|location=United States|date=October 27, 2017|access-date=July 12, 2018}} {{cite journal|url=https://harvardlawreview.org/2017/04/american-samoa-and-the-citizenship-clause/|title=Developments in the Law — American Samoa and the Citizenship Clause: A Study in ''Insular Cases'' Revisionism|journal=Harvard Law Review|volume=130|page=1680|date=2017|access-date=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both citizens and non-citizen nationals may undertake the process of relinquishment of United States nationality.

People who relinquish U.S. citizenship are called "relinquishers", while those who specifically renounce U.S. citizenship are called "renunciants".&lt;ref&gt;[[#7 FAM 1220|7 FAM Exhibit 1227(A) and 1227(B)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The informal term "last-generation Americans", wordplay on terminology for [[immigrant generations]] (such as "first-generation Americans" or "second-generation Americans"), is also seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://maisonneuve.org/article/2017/11/27/last-generation-americans/|first=Anders|last=Morley|title=Last-Generation Americans: Fifty years after the Vietnam War, Anders Morley talks to draft dodgers about their legacy in Canada|magazine=Maison Neuve|date=November 27, 2017|accessdate=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "expatriation" or "expatriates" may lead to some confusion, as in modern parlance an "expatriate" is simply a person who resides abroad, without any implication of giving up citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ahr.oxfordjournals.org/content/114/2/307.full.pdf|first=Nancy L.|last=Green|title=Expatriation, Expatriates, and Expats: The American Transformation of a Concept|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=114|number=2|page=307|date=April 2009|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numbers==

From 2014 to 2016, an average of about five thousand U.S. citizens gave up their citizenship each year. These numbers have risen by nearly ten times between 2005 and 2015, though they remain only about three times the annual numbers in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFJCT1995|url=https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;id=2944|title=Issues Presented By Proposals To Modify The Tax Treatment Of Expatriation|publisher=[[Joint Committee on Taxation]]|date=1995-06-01|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee2017"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dc.law.utah.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1037&amp;context=scholarship|first=Young Ran|last=Lee|title=Considering 'Citizenship Taxation': In Defense of FATCA|journal=Florida Tax Review|volume=20|page=346–347|date=2017|ssrn=2972248|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In absolute terms, few people relinquish U.S. citizenship or citizenship of any other developed country; in almost all countries, the number of people who give up citizenship each year is small relative to the total number of citizens abroad, let alone the total number of citizens in that country. In a 2017 study of citizenship relinquishments in twenty-eight countries, mostly [[OECD]] members, the U.S. came in sixth place in relative terms (i.e. relinquishers as a proportion of citizens abroad), behind [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Estonia]], and [[Japan]]; and second in absolute numbers behind South Korea.&lt;ref name="Lee2017"/&gt; The study author noted that emotional factors and prohibitions on dual citizenship may affect the rates of citizenship relinquishment, and that military conscription may explain the high rates in the other top countries besides the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2017|p=341, 348}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For general discussion of conscription in the other countries mentioned, see [[Estonian Defence Forces#Conscription]], [[conscription in Singapore]], [[conscription in South Korea]], and [[conscription in Taiwan]] (Japan does not practice military conscription).

The graph above presents statistics on relinquishment of U.S. citizenship from three sources. The blue bars are State Department statistics from 1962 to 1994 obtained by the [[Joint Committee on Taxation]] (JCT). During that period, a total of 37,818 U.S. citizens renounced or abandoned their citizenship. It is not clear which of these statistics refer solely to renunciants or include other relinquishers as well; the JCT stated that there were inconsistencies between the definitions used for the statistics for 1962 to 1979 and for 1980 to 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|JCT|1995|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The green bars reflect the number of records of people who have renounced U.S. citizenship added each year to the [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System]] (2006–present).&lt;ref&gt;Section "Active Records in the NICS Index" in ''NICS Operation Report'' for years [https://web.archive.org/web/20170105172452/https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/ops_report2003-2004.pdf 2003/2004] (p. 50), [https://web.archive.org/web/20101018222332/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics/reports/2005-operations-report/ops_report_2005.pdf 2005] (p. 38), [https://web.archive.org/web/20151208082803/https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics/reports/2006-operations-report/ops_report_2006.pdf 2006] (p. 40), [https://web.archive.org/web/20140723212745/https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics/reports/2007-operations-report/ops_report_2007.pdf 2007] (p. 34), [https://web.archive.org/web/20140724163959/https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics/reports/2008-operations-report/ops_report2008.pdf 2008] (p. 34), [https://web.archive.org/web/20140701215512/https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics/reports/2009-operations-report 2009] (p. 24), [https://web.archive.org/web/20140701205200/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics/reports/2010-operations-report/2010-operations-report-pdf 2010] (p. 22), [https://web.archive.org/web/20140701204953/https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics/reports/2011-operations-report/operations-report-2011 2011] (p. 21), [https://web.archive.org/web/20161220154916/https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/about-us/cjis/nics/reports/2012-operations-report#Active%20Records 2012] (web page), [https://web.archive.org/web/20160829030233/https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/about-us/cjis/nics/reports/2013-operations-report 2013] (web page), [https://web.archive.org/web/20150506134705/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics/reports/2014-operations-report 2014] (p. 29), [https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/2015-nics-ops-report.pdf/view 2015] (p. 21), [https://web.archive.org/web/20170615090149/https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/2016-nics-operations-report-final-5-3-2017.pdf 2016] (p. 26), and [https://web.archive.org/web/20180104121258/https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/active_records_in_the_nics-indices.pdf 2017].&lt;/ref&gt; This series includes renunciants and not other relinquishers ''([[#Firearms and explosives|see below]])''.

The proportion of renunciations or other individual expatriating acts among the total number of relinquishments has been reported on occasion. A ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article stated that between 1951 and 1973, a total of 10,000 Americans renounced their citizenship, while another 71,900 lost it "either unknowingly or deliberately, by acquiring a foreign passport".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19740210&amp;id=XT0gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1WYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7094,4213038|first=Joan|last=Zyda|title=Changing Citizenship — Why Americans Go|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=1974-02-10|accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law journal articles in 1975 and 1976 stated that there were 95,000 "administrative determinations of voluntary abandonment of United States citizenship" from 1945 to 1969, including 40,000 on grounds of voting in a foreign election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-Y9jlNInmQC&amp;pg=PA925|first=Arthur John|last=Keefe|title=How to Expatriate Yourself on Ten Easy Grounds|journal=American Bar Association Journal|volume=62|page=925|year=1976|accessdate=2018-04-07}} {{cite journal|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/stexlr17&amp;section=8|first=Jack|last=Wasserman|title=The Voluntary Abandonment of U.S. Citizenship|journal=South Texas Law Journal|volume=17|page=31|year=1975|accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, renunciations accounted for about one-fifth of all relinquishments of citizenship, according to State Department statistics: there were roughly 200 to 300 renunciations per year, among a total of between 800 and 1600 relinquishments per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ipotfipf-fs.pdf|first=James M.|last=Tien|first2=Thomas F.|last2=Rich|chapter=7.

U.S. nationality law does not require an ex-citizen to notify the State Department nor obtain a CLN, but obtaining one may be helpful to prove one's status as a non-U.S. citizen to other governments or private parties, and U.S. tax laws since 2004 ignore relinquishment of citizenship until the person notifies the State Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berg|2014|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obtaining a CLN to demonstrate relinquishment of U.S. citizenship has become a lengthy process with high barriers. The total cost of renouncing U.S. citizenship for a person in France, including the cost of preparing the related tax paperwork, has been reported to be [[Euro|€]]10,000-20,000 on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-16/-accidental-americans-in-france-press-macron-for-irs-relief|first=Gregory|last=Viscusi|title='Accidental Americans' in France Press Macron for IRS Relief|work=Bloomberg|date=April 16, 2018|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allison Christians]] of McGill University and [[Peter Spiro]] of Temple University have suggested that the complexity and cost of the process, especially the $2,350 State Department fee and the potential penalties for failure to file related tax forms, may constitute a breach of the U.S.' obligation not to impose arbitrary barriers to change of nationality, particularly when applied to [[accidental American]]s who have few genuine links to the United States. Such an obligation can be found in the domestic law (the [[Expatriation Act of 1868]]), in international instruments such as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], and in general state practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1486&amp;context=mjil|first=Allison|last=Christians|title=A Global Perspective on Citizenship-Based Taxation|journal=Michigan Journal of International Law|volume=38|issue=2|page=241–242|date=2017|accessdate=June 6, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912061809/http://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1486&amp;context=mjil|archivedate=September 12, 2017|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spiro|2017|p=182–3}}; see also blog posts by the same author: {{cite news|url=http://opiniojuris.org/2008/07/18/us-erects-a-berlin-tax-wall/|first=Peter|last=Spiro|title=U.S. erects a Berlin (Tax) Wall|work=Opinio Juris|date=2008-07-18|accessdate=2014-06-09}} {{cite news|url=http://opiniojuris.org/2012/05/17/will-congress-move-to-tax-ex-patriots/|first=Peter|last=Spiro|title=Will Congress Move to Tax 'Ex-Patriots'?|work=Opinio Juris|date=2012-05-17|accessdate=2014-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty of the process led to a proposal by members of France's [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] that the French government should negotiate with the U.S. government for [[French nationality law|French citizens]] to enjoy a simplified procedure for renouncing U.S. citizenship that did not require payment of such fees, and subsequently a June 2018 resolution in the [[European Parliament]] calling on the [[European Commission]] to carry out similar negotiations in respect of all accidental Americans who were citizens of [[Member state of the European Union|European Union member states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/conjoncture/2018/03/14/20002-20180314ARTFIG00324-americains-accidentels-l-assemblee-nationale-s-empare-du-dossier.php|first=Antoine|last=Garbay|title=«Américains accidentels» : l'Assemblée nationale s'empare du dossier|newspaper=[[Le Figaro]]|date=March 14, 2018|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20180628IPR06837/meps-want-to-open-negotiations-on-an-eu-us-fatca-agreement|title=MEPs want to open negotiations on an EU-US FATCA agreement|publisher=European Parliament|date=July 5, 2018|access-date=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obtaining a CLN by renouncing citizenship requires two interviews by U.S. consular officers; the first interview may be held by telephone, but State Department policy demands that the second must be in person.&lt;ref name="7FAM1260"&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/07FAM/07FAM1260.html|chapter=7 FAM 1260: Renunciation of U.S. Citizenship Abroad|title=[[Foreign Affairs Manual]]|publisher=Department of State|date=September 19, 2014|accessdate=November 4, 2017|ref=7 FAM 1260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obtaining a CLN through other forms of relinquishment, where the individual informs the consulate that he or she had the requisite intent when performing a potentially expatriating act, requires the individual to complete a questionnaire and return it to the consulate, after which the consular officer may request a follow-up interview, either by telephone or in person.&lt;ref&gt;[[#7 FAM 1220|7 FAM 1224.5]].

Interviews are normally conducted on an individual basis, but in 2011 the U.S. Consulate in Toronto held a group appointment for twenty-two people in an apparent attempt to address scheduling difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/americans-in-canada-driven-to-divorce-from-their-country/article4179937/|first=Barrie|last=McKenna|title=Americans in Canada driven to divorce from their country|work=The Globe and Mail|date=November 8, 2011|accessdate=June 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backlogs remain long, with the Toronto consulate reportedly having a 10-month waiting list for appointments in 2015, and the [[Embassy of the United States, Dublin|U.S. Embassy in Dublin]] stating in April 2016 that no more appointments were available until December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1952125/unwilling-dual-citizens-face-10-month-wait-to-shed-u-s-citizenship-in-toronto/|title=Unwilling dual citizens face 10-month wait to shed U.S. citizenship in Toronto|work=Global News|date=April 22, 2015|accessdate=June 17, 2017}} {{cite web|url=https://dublin.usembassy.gov/service2/renunciation-of-citizenship.html|title=Renunciation of the United States|publisher=Embassy of the United States|location=Dublin, Ireland|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407091704/https://dublin.usembassy.gov/service2/renunciation-of-citizenship.html|archivedate=April 7, 2016|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment does not have to be conducted at the diplomatic post in the relinquisher's country of residence, but can be held at a post in another country instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1671945/meet-the-alberta-man-who-went-to-tijuana-to-renounce-his-u-s-citizenship/|title=Meet the Alberta man who went to Tijuana to renounce his U.S. citizenship|work=Global News|date=November 18, 2014|accessdate=June 15, 2014}} 7 FAM 1211(g) specifically states that "There is no requirement that a U.S. citizen renouncing or relinquishing U.S. citizenship abroad be a resident of the U.S. consular district." {{cite book|chapterurl=https://fam.state.gov/fam/07fam/07fam1210.html|chapter=7 FAM 1210: Loss and Restoration of U.S. Citizenship|title=Foreign Affairs Manual|publisher=Department of State|date=December 19, 2014|accessdate=June 15, 2017|ref=7 FAM 1210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the second interview, the person signs a statement confirming that they understand the rights they are giving up, and must pay a fee of $2,350.&lt;ref&gt;[[#7 FAM 1260|7 FAM 1262.4]]. In 2015, the fee was extended to cover relinquishments other than swearing an oath of renunciation: [[#80 FR 53704|80 FR 53704]].

===Waiting for a Certificate of Loss of Nationality===

Wait time to receive a CLN varies. Cuban spy [[René González]] received his CLN within days of renouncing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-cuban-spy-officially-stripped-of-us-citizenship-2013may10-story.html|title=Cuban spy officially stripped of US citizenship|newspaper=San Diego Union-Tribune|agency=Associated Press|date=May 10, 2013|accessdate=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have reported wait times of as long as a year. The loss of citizenship is deemed to take legal effect on the date of the actual relinquishing act, rather than the date of approval of the CLN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/135454/use-of-certificate-of-loss-of-nationality-allowed-after-renunciation-of-us-citizenship|first=Lourdes Santos|last=Tancinco|title=Use of certificate of loss of nationality allowed after renunciation of US citizenship|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=January 24, 2016|accessdate=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While approval of the CLN is pending, the State Department will not issue a U.S. visa to a person who has relinquished citizenship, meaning that in general the person cannot travel to the United States. In exceptional cases, the State Department says that it can permit a relinquisher with an "urgent need to travel" to the U.S. while the CLN is pending to use a [[United States passport|U.S. passport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/expat/2015/03/16/u-s-government-changes-citizenship-renunciation-passport-policy-after-criticism/|first=Helen|last=Burggraf|title=U.S. Government Changes Citizenship Renunciation Passport Policy After Criticism|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=March 16, 2015|accessdate=April 15, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323125313/https://blogs.wsj.com/expat/2015/03/16/u-s-government-changes-citizenship-renunciation-passport-policy-after-criticism/|archivedate=March 23, 2015}} Describes an update to [[#7 FAM 1220|7 FAM 1227(e)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following confirmation by State Department officials in Washington, DC, the consulate provides a copy of the CLN to the former citizen, and returns his or her U.S. passport after cancelling it. The State Department also forwards copies of the CLN to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the [[Department of Homeland Security]], and the [[Internal Revenue Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/07FAM/07FAM1240.html|chapter=7 FAM 1240: Interagency Coordination and Reporting Requirements|title=Foreign Affairs Manual|publisher=Department of State|date=November 12, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2017|ref=7 FAM 1240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal elements==
===Voluntariness and intent===

[[File:US Consulate General Amsterdam Museumplein Dec 2013.JPG|thumb|right|The State Department now requires that a relinquisher seeking to obtain a [[Certificate of Loss of Nationality]] attend an in-person interview at a U.S. diplomatic mission abroad, such as the U.S. Consulate in Amsterdam ''(pictured)'', to assess the person's intent towards U.S. citizenship.]]

Beginning with the [[Expatriation Act of 1907]], Congress began to define concrete acts from which the intent to give up citizenship would be inferred, in what Nora Graham describes as the start of "the process of the government transforming voluntary expatriation into denationalization".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Graham|2004|p=697}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitutional basis for this was not the [[Naturalization Clause]], as Supreme Court [[obitur dictum|dicta]] limited the scope of this power. Rather, the government successfully argued for decades, beginning in ''[[Mackenzie v. Hare]]'', that this arose from the inherent power of sovereignty in foreign relations. The [[Nationality Act of 1940]] greatly expanded the list of acts regarded as criteria for a finding of voluntary expatriation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8181&amp;context=penn_law_review|first=John P.|last=Roche|title=Loss of American Nationality: The Development of Statutory Expatriation|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|volume=99|page=25, 26|date=1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court eventually rejected this argument in ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'' (1967), ruling that under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], Congress lacked the power to deprive a native-born or naturalized citizen of U.S. citizenship, and that loss of citizenship required the individual's assent. Then in ''[[Vance v. Terrazas]]'' (1980), the court further clarified that mere performance of expatriating acts could not be taken as "conclusive evidence" of assent to loss of citizenship, but rather that the [[trier of fact]] must also find an intent to relinquish citizenship either "in words" or "as fair inference from proven conduct".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://via.library.depaul.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2996&amp;context=law-review|first=Robert|last=Ward|title=Constitutional Law - Involuntary Expatriation - Specific Intent to Relinquish Citizenship Required|journal=DePaul Law Review|volume=19|issue=1|date=1969|page=202|accessdate=April 12, 2018|ref=harv}} {{cite journal|url=https://repository.law.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1854&amp;context=umialr|first=Matthew J.|last=Buckley|title=Loss of United States Citizenship: Fourteenth Amendment Limitations on Congressionally Mandated Expatriation, ''Vance v.

Section 702 of the same act would have imposed a $10,000 fine and a prison sentence of up to one year on naturalized citizens who had taken the [[Oath of Allegiance (United States)|Oath of Allegiance]] and subsequently voted in an election, ran for elective office, served in any government body, used the passport, took an oath of allegiance, or served in the armed forces of their country of former citizenship.

In general, the Department of Justice takes the position that renunciation pursuant to a plea bargain is voluntary and demonstrates intent to give up U.S. citizenship. However, the [[Office of Legal Counsel]] outlined some circumstances under which a court might regard such a renunciation as involuntary, including "physical or mental intimidation", material misrepresentation of the plea agreement, or withholding material evidence. In at least one case prior to 1984, a State Department official refused to certify that a renunciation under such a plea bargain was voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/1984/09/31/op-olc-v008-p0220.pdf|first=Ralph W.|last=Tarr|title=Voluntariness of Renunciations of Citizenship under 8 U.S.C. 1481(a)(6)|journal=Opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel|volume=8|page=220|date=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cases from the late 1950s and 1960s held that a potentially expatriating act could not actually cause loss of citizenship absent awareness that one had citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://scholarship.law.stjohns.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4279&amp;context=lawreview|first=Abraham|last=Scharf|title=A Study of the Law of Expatriation|journal=St. John's Law Review|volume=38|issue=2|pages=251, 256|date=May 1964|accessdate=April 12, 2018}} Cites {{cite case|litigants=Rogers v.

}}

{{USCSub|8|1481|b}} places the burden of proof for relinquishment of citizenship "upon the person or party claiming that such loss occurred, to establish such claim by a preponderance of the evidence", and establishes the presumption that a potentially expatriating act was performed voluntarily. Thus, when an individual citizen asserts that it was his or her intent to relinquish citizenship, the burden of proof is on the individual to prove that intent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#7 FAM 1220|7 FAM 1224.4(c)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard of [[preponderance of the evidence]] means that "it was more likely than not that the individual intended to relinquish citizenship at the time of the expatriating act"; the intent must be contemporaneous with the act.&lt;ref&gt;[[#7 FAM 1220|7 FAM 1225.2]]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the enactment of 1481(b), the Supreme Court had held in ''[[Nishikawa v. Dulles]]'' that, in the absence of any Congressionally enacted standard of evidence, expatriation cases required the same standard of [[clear and convincing evidence]] as in denaturalization cases. Decades after the enactment of 1481(b), the Supreme Court upheld the new standard of evidence in ''Vance v. Terrazas'' in January 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2405&amp;context=cklawreview|first=Mary Kempers |last=McCarthy|title=Evidentiary Proof in Expatriation Proceedings|journal=Chicago-Kent Law Review|volume=57|issue=1|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This provision, recommended by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC), passed into law in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/annualreportfory1961unit#page/146/mode/2up|title=Annual report for the year 1961|publisher=House Un-American Activities Committee, United States Congress|date=1961|p=146|accessdate=June 15, 2017|ref=CITEREFHUAC1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; HUAC chairman [[Francis E. Walter]] first introduced bills with this provision in February 1960 and January 1961, and it was eventually inserted into a Senate-originated bill on war orphans in August 1961.&lt;ref name="HUAC1961-164"&gt;{{harvnb|HUAC|1961|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House Judiciary Committee report on that bill stated that the burden of proof "would rest on the Government", whereas HUAC's later annual report noted that the burden of proof was on "the party claiming that such loss occurred".&lt;ref name="HUAC1961-164"/&gt; In the committee report on the bill, Walter described this provision as "forestall[ing] further erosion of the statute designed to preserve and uphold the dignity and priceless value of U.S. citizenship with attendant obligations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3997056;view=1up;seq=1043|title=87th Congress, 1st Session, House Report 1086: Amending the Immigration and Nationality Act and for other purposes|series=Congressional Serial Set 12342|date=1961|access-date=2017-11-04|page=[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3997056;view=1up;seq=1083 40]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Garry Davis]], who renounced U.S. citizenship in 1948 at the U.S. Embassy in Paris, attempted to return to the United States in 1978 without a visa, and was granted [[parole (United States immigration)|parole]] into the U.S. but not legal admission. In an appeal against deportation, he argued that he had only renounced United States citizenship but not the citizenship of the state of [[Maine]] where he was born. He further argued that the U.S. Constitution's [[Privileges and Immunities Clause]] meant that as a citizen of Maine he could not be denied the privilege of living in [[New Hampshire]] which New Hampshire citizens enjoyed. Judge [[Thomas Aquinas Flannery]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|DC District Court]] did not address the first argument but rejected the second, writing that while the state of New Hampshire could not restrict Davis' travel or access there, under the Constitution's [[Naturalization Clause]] Congress has sole and absolute authority to make laws regarding the entry and deportation of people other than United States citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite case|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/19791659481FSupp1178_11490/DAVIS%20v.%20DISTRICT%20DIRECTOR,%20IMMIGRATION,%20ETC.|litigants=Davis v.

In 1998, the DC District Court considered another case involving a renunciant who returned to the United States without a visa.&lt;ref name="LozadaColonCase"&gt;{{cite case|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/1998452FSupp2d43_141/LOZADA%20COLON%20v.%20U.S.%20DEPT.%20OF%20STATE|litigants=Lozada Colon v.

In 1998, the State Department formally refused to issue a CLN to Lozada Colón, stating that his continued assertion of the right to reside in the United States without obtaining a visa demonstrated his lack of intent to relinquish United States citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1998-02-02/news/9802020254_1_puerto-rico-puerto-rican-citizenship|first=Lance|last=Oliver|title=Citizenship Questions Not Settled|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=February 2, 1998|accessdate=June 15, 2017}} {{cite journal|url=http://scholarsarchive.library.albany.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=lacs_fac_scholar|first=Pedro|last=Caban|title=The Puerto Rican Colonial Matrix: The Etiology of Citizenship|journal=Centro Journal|volume=XXV|number=1|date=2013|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lozada Colón petitioned for a [[writ of mandamus]] to compel the State Department to issue his CLN, arguing that he could relinquish U.S. citizenship while keeping [[Puerto Rican citizenship]] and thus the right to return to his homeland of Puerto Rico.

===Other citizenship recommended but not required===
[[File:Mike Gogulski, 2007 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mike Gogulski]] voluntarily gave up his U.S. citizenship without acquiring any other.]]

The United States is not a signatory to either the 1954 [[Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons]] nor the 1961 [[Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness]]. As such, the United States permits citizens to relinquish their citizenship even when those citizens have no other citizenship, without regard to the conventions' attempts to prevent statelessness from occurring as a result of voluntary relinquishment of nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.vanderbilt.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/78/Price-FINAL.pdf|first=Polly|last=Price|title=Stateless in the United States: Current  Reality and a Future Prediction|journal=Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law|volume=46|pages=443, 452–3|year=2013|accessdate=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Department warns that "severe hardship" could result to individuals making themselves stateless, that even those with permanent residence in their country "could encounter difficulties continuing to reside there without a nationality", and that a foreign country might deport stateless ex-U.S. citizens back to the United States. However, "[i]n making all these points clear to potentially stateless renunciants, the Department of State will, nevertheless, afford them their right to expatriate."&lt;ref&gt;[[#7 FAM 1210|7 FAM 1215]] and [[#7 FAM 1260|7 FAM 1261(g)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several known cases in which former U.S. citizens made themselves stateless voluntarily. [[Henry Martyn Noel]] moved to [[Allied-occupied Germany]] in the aftermath of World War II and voluntarily made himself stateless to protest "a climax of nationalism" he saw rising around him in the United States.&lt;ref name="Daytona"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&amp;dat=19480218&amp;id=V9QpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YcgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2999,5647704|title=Harvard Man Gives Up His Citizenship|work=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|date=February 18, 1948|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Jolley]] renounced U.S. citizenship in 1967 after acquiring [[Permanent residency in Canada|landed immigrant status in Canada]] (but not citizenship there) in order to avoid being drafted to serve in the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name="Lorenz1972"/&gt; [[Raffi Hovannisian]] renounced U.S. citizenship in April 2001 and made himself stateless to protest a decade-long delay in the processing of his application for [[Armenian nationality law|Armenian citizenship]]; he was subsequently granted Armenian citizenship by presidential degree about four months later.&lt;ref name="Makaryan2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eudo-citizenship.eu/docs/CountryReports/Armenia.pdf|first=Shushanik|last=Makaryan|title=Country report: Armenia|publisher=EUDO Citizenship Observatory|date=March 2013|accessdate=April 22, 2018|page=12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083200/http://eudo-citizenship.eu/docs/CountryReports/Armenia.pdf|archivedate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Garry Davis]] and [[Mike Gogulski]] made themselves stateless because they felt that their respective political philosophies precluded allegiance to any one country.&lt;ref name="Mendoza2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/111205/stateless-slovakia--renounce-us-citizenship-mike-gogulski|first=Moises|last=Mendoza|title=Stateless in Slovakia: What if you renounce US citizenship … and you have no nationality to fall back on?

One case in which a stateless ex-U.S. citizen was deported back to the United States, as warned of by the State Department, was that of [[Joel Slater]]. Slater, motivated by opposition to the [[foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration]], renounced in Perth, Australia, in 1987. After Australia deported him back to the United States, he subsequently proceeded to Canada en route to the French [[Overseas territory (France)|overseas territory]] of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], but failed to secure permission to remain there, and was deported from Canada back to the United States as well.&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes19921127"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19921127&amp;slug=1526849|first=Kim|last=Boatman|title=A Man Without A Country, Literally|work=The Seattle Times|date=November 27, 1992|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, renunciation of U.S. citizenship forestalled or prevented the stateless individual's deportation. [[Clare Negrini]] renounced U.S. citizenship in Italy in 1951 and made herself stateless in an effort to prevent Italy from expelling her back to the United States; she later married an Italian citizen and acquired Italian citizenship through him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/winona-republican-herald/1951-12-15/page-5|title=Former Priest, Girl Plan Wedding|work=Winona Republican-Herald|date=December 15, 1951|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harmon Wilfred]] renounced U.S. citizenship in New Zealand in 2005 and made himself stateless after [[Immigration New Zealand]] (INZ) denied his application for a visa extension to remain in the country.

===No relinquishment by parent or guardian===

In early U.S. legal history, the Supreme Court recognized the expatriation of a minor by his father's action in ''Inglis v. Trustees of Sailor's Snug Harbor'' (1830). In that case, the plaintiff had been born in New York City, but the success of his action to recover real estate turned on the [[question of law|legal question]] of his citizenship. It was not clear whether he was born before or after the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], but it was common ground that his loyalist father [[United Empire Loyalist|took him to Nova Scotia]] after the [[Evacuation Day (New York)|1783 British evacuation of New York]]. Justice [[Smith Thompson]], writing the majority opinion, held that the father's action constituted election to be a British subject under the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]], and that decision extended to the plaintiff as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=I-Mien|last=Tsiang|title=The Question of Expatriation in America Prior to 1907|series=The Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science, Series LX|volume=3|year=1942|page=67|oclc=768266232|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;"The facts disclosed in this case, then, lead irresistibly to the conclusion that it was the fixed determination of Charles Inglis the father, at the declaration of independence, to adhere to his native allegiance.  And John Inglis the son must be deemed to have followed the condition of his father, and the character of a British subject attached to and fastened on him also, which he has never attempted to throw off by any act disaffirming the choice made for him by his father." {{cite case|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/28/99/case.html|litigants=Inglis v.

In the early 20th century, the State Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service clashed on the question of whether parental action could result in loss of citizenship of minor children. Though the Attorney-General favored the State Department's view that it could, in 1939 the Supreme Court held in ''[[Perkins v. Elg]]'' that a citizen born in the U.S. did not lose her own citizenship when her parents, both naturalized [[Swedish Americans|Americans of Swedish origin]], returned to Sweden and her father renounced his American citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roche|1950|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, the U.S. Consulate in Calgary ruled that Carol Tapanila, an [[American Canadians|American-born Canadian]] woman who had renounced her own U.S. citizenship, could not renounce on behalf of her developmentally disabled son; the son was also ruled unable to renounce on his own due to his inability to understand the concept of citizenship or renunciation, thus leaving him permanently subject to U.S. taxation on gains in his Canadian government-funded [[Registered Disability Savings Plan]].&lt;ref name="Cain2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1217871/how-to-get-rid-of-an-unwanted-u-s-citizenship/|first=Patrick|last=Cain|title=How to get rid of your U.S. citizenship|work=Global News|date=April 4, 2014|accessdate=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hildebrant2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/u-s-fatca-tax-law-catches-unsuspecting-canadians-in-its-crosshairs-1.2493864|first=Amber|last=Hildebrant|title=U.S. FATCA tax law catches unsuspecting Canadians in its crosshairs|work=CBC News|date=January 13, 2014|accessdate=June 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statutory definition of some potentially expatriating acts, namely foreign naturalization, foreign oath of allegiance, and foreign government service, requires that the person performing them have been eighteen years or older at the time in order to relinquish citizenship through those acts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#7 FAM 1210|7 FAM 1214(b)(7)]] and {{cite book|chapterurl=https://fam.state.gov/fam/07fam/07fam1290.html|chapter=7 FAM 1290: Minors, Incompetents, Prisoners, Plea Bargains, Cults and Other Special Circumstances|title=Foreign Affairs Manual|publisher=Department of State|date=March 25, 2013|accessdate=June 15, 2017|ref=7 FAM 1290}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no statutory age restriction on renunciation before a U.S. diplomatic officer abroad; nevertheless, the State Department often refuses to accept renunciations by minors, and carefully scrutinizes cases involving even individuals who have recently attained the age of majority, on the theory that they may be subject to ongoing influence by their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.emirates247.com/news/i-accidentally-became-a-us-citizen-and-cannot-get-rid-of-the-passport-2013-11-23-1.528931|first=Majorie|last=Van Leijen|title='I accidentally became a US citizen and cannot get rid of the passport': Minors who have involuntarily acquired US citizenship find it difficult to renounce it|work=Emirates 24/7|date=November 23, 2013|accessdate=February 11, 2018}} Cites language in [[#7 FAM 1290|7 FAM 1290]] and {{cite book|chapterurl=https://fam.state.gov/fam/07fam/07fam1230.html#M1236|chapter=7 FAM 1236: Reviewing the Record|title=Foreign Affairs Manual|publisher=Department of State|date=June 29, 2012|accessdate=February 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for relinquishing citizenship==

===Foreign prohibitions on multiple citizenship===

[[File:Valdas Adamkus.2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[Valdas Adamkus]] renounced U.S. citizenship to run for [[president of Lithuania]], and was elected to the position twice.]]

Although the U.S. government has removed most restrictions on [[multiple citizenship|dual or multiple citizenship]] from its nationality laws, some other countries retain such restrictions, and U.S. citizens in such countries may choose to give up U.S. citizenship to comply with those restrictions.

Some foreign countries do not permit their citizens to hold other citizenships at all. Bars on dual citizenship take a variety of forms, but two common provisions in such countries' laws are that a foreigner seeking to become a citizen of the country generally must obtain release from any other citizenships according to the laws of those other countries (a provision seen for example in South Korea and Austria), and that a person who was born with dual citizenship must choose whether to retain the local citizenship or the foreign citizenship upon reaching the age of majority (e.g. in Japan).&lt;ref name="Seeker"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.seeker.com/which-countries-dont-allow-dual-citizenship-1933771298.html|title=Which Countries Don't Allow Dual Citizenship?|publisher=[[Seeker (media company)|Seeker]]|date=2016-07-20|accessdate=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, many individuals relinquishing citizenship were naturalized citizens returning to their countries of birth; for example, the State Department indicated to the JCT that many of the 858 U.S. citizens who renounced in 1994 were former [[Korean Americans]] who returned to South Korea and resumed their citizenship there, which under [[South Korean nationality law]] required them to give up their U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|JCT|1995|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1990s, the number of relinquishments had fallen to about 400 per year. The State Department speculated that the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] resulted in "fewer people renounc[ing] their U.S. citizenship as a condition of employment in an Asian country".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ashby|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even countries which permit dual citizenship may bar dual citizens from government positions. Australia for example does not allow dual citizens to stand for election to Parliament, while Taiwan bars dual citizens from most public-sector positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-13/dual-nationality-crisis-claims-eighth-aussie-lawmaker-scalp|first=Jason|last=Scott|title=Australia’s Dual-Nationality Crisis Claims Eighth Victim|work=Bloomberg Politics|date=November 13, 2017|access-date=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mt3LhhI3ZwwC&amp;pg=PA213|first=Bernard|last=Wong|title=The Chinese in Silicon Valley: Globalization, Social Networks, and Ethnic Identity|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2006|page=213|isbn=9780742539402}} {{cite web|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawAllIf.aspx?PCode=S0020001|title=公務人員任用法第 28 條|publisher=Ministry of Justice|location=Taiwan|date=June 17, 2015|access-date=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diplomatic and consular positions present additional difficulties. The [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] and [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations]] state that a country may refuse to receive a diplomat or consular officer who holds the citizenship of the receiving country. Based on this, the State Department does not receive U.S. citizens and non-citizen nationals as diplomats representing a foreign country to the United States. The State Department permits such individuals to represent a foreign country in its [[diplomatic mission]] at [[United Nations Headquarters]] in New York City, but while in such positions they enjoy only [[consular immunity|official acts immunity]] and not [[diplomatic immunity]]. Thus, an individual wishing to assume a diplomatic or consular position in the United States may choose to relinquish U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/07FAM/07FAM1280.html|chapter=7 FAM 1280: Loss of Nationality and Taking up a Position in a Foreign Government|title=Foreign Affairs Manual|publisher=Department of State|date=March 25, 2013|accessdate=June 15, 2017|ref=7 FAM 1280}}&lt;/ref&gt; One early example of this, which was described at the time as the first such case in U.S. diplomatic history, was [[Oskar R. Lange]]'s decision to renounce citizenship in 1945 to become the Polish ambassador to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/image/370000738/|first=Walter|last=Trohan|title=Lange to yield citizenship to be Poles' envoy|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=August 20, 1945|accessdate=April 15, 2018|quote=For the first time in the diplomatic history of the United States, an American citizen is renouncing his allegiance to his adopted country in order to become the ambassador to Washington of the nation he disowned ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax compliance difficulties for U.S. citizens abroad===

[[File:Individual taxation systems.png|thumb|left|Systems of taxation on personal income{{legend|#00FF00|No income tax on individuals}}{{legend|#0080FF|Territorial}}{{legend|#000080|Residential}}{{legend|#FF00FF|Citizenship-based}}]]

===U.S. military service===

===Other reasons===

Other individual ex-citizens have expressed a variety of reasons for giving up U.S. citizenship.

[[Vincent Cate]], an [[encryption]] expert living in [[Anguilla]], chose to renounce his U.S. citizenship in 1998 to avoid the possibility of violating U.S. laws that may have [[export of cryptography in the United States|prohibited U.S. citizens from "exporting" encryption software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/media/nytimes.06sep98.html|first=Peter|last=Wayner|title=Encryption Expert Says U.S. Laws Led to Renouncing of Citizenship|work=The New York Times Sunday|date=September 6, 1998|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some individuals have given up U.S. citizenship as part of [[plea bargain]]s, in order to receive reduced penalties for certain crimes. Examples include [[Arthur Rudolph]] and [[Yaser Esam Hamdi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnston |first=David |title=Scientist Accused as Ex-Nazi Is Denied Citizenship |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/20/us/scientist-accused-as-ex-nazi-is-denied-citizenship.html |date=February 20, 1993|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1926&amp;context=jil|first=Leslie|last=Esbrook|title=Citizenship Unmoored: Expatriation as a Counter-Terrorism Tool|journal=University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Law|volume=37|issue=4|page=1274, 1293|year=2016|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Department notes that "some would liken [this] to banishment when a citizen at birth is involved".&lt;ref&gt;[[#7 FAM 1290|7 FAM 1294.3]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Relinquishing acts since 1978==

[[File:E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse, DC.jpg|thumb|right|Litigation about relinquishing acts typically takes place in the [[E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse]], where the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]] sits.]]

U.S. law explicitly lists the acts by which one may relinquish U.S. citizenship at {{USCSub|8|1481|a}}, and previously in other sections of the same subchapter. The list itself was last amended in 1978 to delete the provisions on loss of citizenship for draft evasion, desertion, failure to reside in the United States by naturalized citizens, voting in foreign elections, and failure to reside in the United States by citizens born abroad. The former four had already been struck down by the Supreme Court a decade earlier or more in ''[[Trop v. Dulles]]'' (1958), ''[[Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez]]'' (1963),  ''[[Schneider v. Rusk]]'' (1964), and ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'' (1967). The final provision had been upheld in ''[[Rogers v. Bellei]]'' (1971), but the State Department favored its repeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|95|HR|13349}}; {{USPL|95|432}}; {{USStat|92|1046}}. See {{cite book|author=House Committee on the Judiciary|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.a0012138863;view=1up;seq=143|title=House Report 95-1493: Repeal of Certain Expatriation Provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act: report to accompany H.R. 13349|series=Congressional Serial Set|volume=No. 13207-11|publisher=Government Printing Office|year=1978|accessdate=February 8, 2018|oclc=880053179}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conditions for relinquishment under some potentially expatriating acts were modified by the Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1986, which also inserted the general requirement of "intention to relinquish" in conformance with the Supreme Court's ruling in ''Vance v. Terrazas'' (1980).&lt;ref name="INAA1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zisman"&gt;{{cite document|url=http://razismanlaw.com/articles/86-2/|title=Loss of U.S. Citizenship: Expatriation|publisher=R.A. Zisman Law|date=January 1, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last amendment to this section was contained in the Immigration Technical Corrections Act of 1988, which extended the requirement of intention to relinquishing acts prior to the effective date of the 1986 amendments.&lt;ref name="Zisman"/&gt;

===Naturalization in a foreign country===

{{USCSub|8|1481|a|1}} provides for relinquishment through "obtaining naturalization in a foreign state upon his own application or upon an application filed by a duly authorized agent". The U.S. government did not recognize unequivocally that a U.S. citizen could choose to give up citizenship by becoming a citizen of a foreign country until the passage of the [[Expatriation Act of 1868]], and instead treated them as continuing to be U.S. citizens regardless of their intent, for example in the Supreme Court case ''[[Talbot v. Janson]]'' (1795).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsiang|1942|pp=30–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1868, the State Department regarded foreign naturalization as effecting expatriation in nearly all cases, again without regard to the citizen's intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsiang|1942|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State Department continued to regard foreign naturalization as demonstrating intent to relinquish U.S. citizenship even after ''Vance v. Terrazas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/nyuilp16&amp;div=37&amp;id=&amp;page=|first=L.|last=Abramson|title=United States Loss of Citizenship Law after Terrazas: Decisions of the Board of Appellate Review|journal=New York University Journal of International Law and Politics|volume=16|page=829|year=1984}} {{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/sanlr23&amp;div=19&amp;id=&amp;page=|first=A.G.|last=James|title=The Board of Appellate Review of the Department of State: The Right to Appellate Review of Administrative Determinations of Loss of Nationality|journal=San Diego Law Review|volume=23|page=261|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1985, in ''Richards v. Secretary of State'' the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] upheld a State Department finding of expatriation against a man who had naturalized in Canada, despite his protests that he did not wish to give up U.S. citizenship and that he had only naturalized in order to keep his job with [[Scouts Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite case|litigants=Richards v.

For the reasons given below we conclude that the Department has satisfied its burdern of proving that appellant's naturalization in Canada was accompanied by the requisite intent. Accordingly the Department's determination that appellant expatriated herself is affirmed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy ended in April 1990, when the State Department began applying a presumption of intent to retain U.S. citizenship to most potentially expatriating acts, including naturalization in a foreign country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelly|1991|pp=421, 442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State Department used to assert that acquisition of [[Israeli nationality law|Israeli citizenship]] by operation of the [[Law of Return]] after moving to Israel on an [[aliyah|oleh]]'s visa could not trigger loss of citizenship under 1481(a)(1) even if the citizen stated that it was his or her intent to relinquish. In ''Fox v. Clinton'', the plaintiff challenged this policy and won recognition of his relinquishment on appeal to the [[United States Circuit Court for the District of Columbia|DC Circuit Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2012/06/12/its-hard-to-become-a-non-citizen-too/|first=Joe|last=Palazollo|title=It's Hard to Become a Non-Citizen, Too|work=Wall Street Journal|date=June 12, 2012|access-date=November 4, 2017}} Cites {{cite case|litigants=Fox v.

===Oath of allegiance to a foreign country===

{{USCSub|8|1481|a|2}} provides for relinquishment through "taking an oath or making an affirmation or other formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state or a political subdivision thereof". This provision was first found in Section 2 of the Expatriation Act of 1907, and was re-enacted in Section 401(b) of the Nationality Act of 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roche|1950|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In various cases before the [[Board of Immigration Appeals]] up to 1950, oaths which were held as not establishing expatriation included an oath required for employment by a Canadian government-owned airline, an [[ordination]] oath in the [[Church of England]], and an admission oath in the [[German Bar Association]]. State Department officials also held that the oath should be required by the laws of the foreign state and sworn before an officer of its government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roche|1950|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Gillars v. United States'' (1950), an appeal in the treason trial of [[Mildred Gillars]], the DC Circuit Court rejected Gillars' contention that a letter she signed in the aftermath of a workplace dispute expressing allegiance to Germany resulted in her expatriation because it was informal in nature, not signed before any German government official, and not connected to German regulations or legal procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite case|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/182/962/73652/|litigants=Gillars v. United States|vol=182|reporter=F.2d|opinion=962|court=D.C. Cir.|year=1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Baker v. Rusk'' (1969), the DC Circuit Court rejected the government's contention that Baker had expatriated himself by swearing an oath to [[King George V]] in order to gain admission to the [[Canadian Bar Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|1969|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in ''[[Vance v. Terrazas]]'' (1980), the Supreme Court held that even when an oath sworn to a foreign government contains language specifically renouncing allegiance to the United States, the government cannot use the oath itself as evidence of intent to relinquish citizenship, but must establish such intent independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buckley|1980|p=739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the State Department added four criteria to the ''Foreign Affairs Manual'' regarding what would be considered a "meaningful oath" for purposes of this provision. The fourth criterion required that "making and receipt of the oath or affirmation alters the affiant’s legal status with respect to the foreign state", giving the example that a citizen of a foreign country could not expatriate him or herself by taking an oath of allegiance to that same country, unless the oath gave the person a "new citizenship status ... such as a retention of citizenship that might otherwise be lost".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/07FAM/07FAM1250.html|chapter=7 FAM 1250: Naturalization and Oath of Allegiance to a Foreign State|title=Foreign Affairs Manual|publisher=Department of State|date=February 23, 2017|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serving in a foreign military===
{{USCSub|8|1481|a|3}} provides for relinquishment through "entering, or serving in, the armed forces of a foreign state" if either the person serves "as a commissioned or non-commissioned officer" or "such armed forces are engaged in hostilities against the United States". 1481(a)(3) does not require that the person have attained the age of eighteen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/07FAM/07FAM1270.html|chapter=7 FAM 1270: Military Service and Loss of Nationality|title=Foreign Affairs Manual|publisher=Department of State|date=June 29, 2012|accessdate=April 12, 2018|ref=7 FAM 1270}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Department's 1990 presumption of intent to retain U.S. citizenship does not apply to service in the military of a foreign country engaged in hostilities against the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#7 FAM 1270|7 FAM 1271]].&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Supreme Court considered the Nationality Act of 1940's predecessor to this provision in ''[[Nishikawa v. Dulles]]'' (1958), the majority struck down the government's contention that plaintiff-appellant Mitsugi Nishikawa's service in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] during WWII could serve to effect his expatriation under this provision, because he had been conscripted. The minority objected that by the time the provision had been written, "conscription and not voluntary enlistment had become the usual method of raising armies throughout the world, and it can hardly be doubted that Congress was aware of this fact."&lt;ref name=Kim_HC&gt;{{cite book | last=Kim|first=Hyung-chan| title=A Legal History of Asian Americans, 1790–1990 | publisher=Greenwood Press | location=Westport, Connecticut | year=1994 | isbn=0-313-29142-X |pages=124–125}} {{cite case|url=https://openjurist.org/356/us/129|litigants=Nishikawa v.

{{USCSub|8|1481|a|4}} provides for relinquishment through "accepting, serving in, or performing the duties of any office, post, or employment under the government of a foreign state or political subdivision thereof", if the person "has or acquires the nationality of such foreign state" or "if an oath, affirmation, or declaration of allegiance is required".&lt;ref&gt;[[#7 FAM 1280|7 FAM 1282]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the State Department's 1990 presumption of intent to retain U.S. citizenship applies only to non-policy-level employment in a foreign government, even policy-level employment typically does not result in loss of citizenship if the individual says that he or she did not intend to give up citizenship. However, the State Department has expressed some reservations whether serving as a foreign head of state, head of government, or minister of foreign affairs is compatible with maintaining United States citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#7 FAM 1280|7 FAM 1285]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the respective [[Compact of Free Association|Compacts of Free Association]], service with the governments of the [[Marshall Islands]], the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], or [[Palau]] is not an expatriating act.&lt;ref&gt;[[#7 FAM 1280|7 FAM 1283(d)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renunciation at a U.S. diplomatic mission abroad===

{{USCSub|8|1481|a|5}} provides for renunciation "before a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States in a foreign state, in such form as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State". The text of the oath is found in Form DS-4080.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eforms.state.gov/Forms/ds4080.pdf|title=DS-4080: Oath/Affirmation of Renunciation of Nationality of United States|publisher=U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs|date=January 2013|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990 presumption of intent to retain U.S. citizenship does not apply to swearing an oath of renunciation before a U.S. diplomatic officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/Advice-about-Possible-Loss-of-US-Nationality-Dual-Nationality.html|title=Advice about Possible Loss of U.S. Nationality and Dual Nationality|website=travel.state.gov|publisher=Department of State|location=United States|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Department describes renunciation as "the most unequivocal way in which someone can manifest an intention to relinquish U.S. citizenship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Renunciation-US-Nationality-Abroad.html|title=Renunciation of U.S. Nationality Abroad|website=travel.state.gov|publisher=Department of State|location=United States|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major legal distinction between renunciation and other forms of relinquishment is that "[i]t is much more difficult to establish a lack of intent or duress for renunciation".&lt;ref&gt;[[#7 FAM 1210|7 FAM 1211(h)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A large-scale case in which renunciations of U.S. citizenship were later overturned was that of the [[African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem]]. In the early 1980s, at least 700 members of the community who had settled in [[Israel]] renounced their U.S. citizenship in the hopes that statelessness would prevent their deportation back to the United States, though their children tended to retain citizenship. Groups of four to six per week came to the [[Embassy of the United States, Tel Aviv|U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv]] to renounce citizenship, over a period of years. Around 1990, the community began negotiating with the Israeli government in an effort to regularize their immigration status; one condition of the mass grant of residence permits was for the community members to re-acquire U.S. citizenship, so that the small number of criminals who had tried to hide in their community could be deported back to the United States. The State Department accepted community leaders' argument that the earlier renunciations had been made under duress due to the social and political environment at the time, and were thus involuntary and did not meet the legal requirements to terminate citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://adst.org/2017/02/american-israeli-tensions-black-hebrew-community/|first=Wayne|last=Leininger|title=American-Israeli Tensions over the Black Hebrew Community|publisher=[[Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training]]|date=February 2017|accessdate=April 17, 2018}} {{cite book|last=Michaeli|first=Ethan|chapter=Another Exodus: The Hebrew Israelites from Chicago to Dimona|page=74|editor-first=Yvonne Patricia|editor-last=Chireau|editor2-first=Nathaniel|editor2-last=Deutsch|editor2-link=Nathaniel Deutsch|title=Black Zion: African American Religious Encounters with Judaism|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-511257-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renunciation within U.S. territory===
{{main|Renunciation Act of 1944}}

[[File:Tule Lake Relocation Center, Newell, California. A view in the lunch shed at the farm. Trucks from . . . - NARA - 538339.tif|thumb|left|Thousands of [[Japanese Americans]] at the [[Tule Lake]] internment camp ''(pictured)'' renounced U.S. citizenship in 1944 and 1945.]]

{{USCSub|8|1481|a|6}} provides for renunciation from within U.S. territory "in such form as may be prescribed by, and before such officer as may be designated by, the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], whenever the United States shall be in a state of war and the Attorney General shall approve such renunciation as not contrary to the interests of national defense". It was intended to encourage militants among [[internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese American internees]] to renounce U.S. citizenship so that they could continue to be detained if internment were to be declared unconstitutional. About five thousand individuals, mostly at [[Tule Lake]], renounced citizenship for a variety of reasons, including anger at the U.S. government for the internment and the desire to remain with non-citizen family members whom they feared would be deported to Japan. After the war, civil rights lawyer [[Wayne M. Collins]] helped many fight legal battles in the courts to regain their citizenship, while some such as [[Joseph Kurihara]] accepted deportation to Japan and lived out the rest of their lives there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jpri.org/publications/workingpapers/wp110.html|first=Ellen Clare|last=Kennedy|title=The Japanese-American Renunciants: Due Process and the Danger of Making Laws During Times of Fear|journal=JPRI Working Papers|issue=110|date=October 2006|accessdate=2013-07-01}} {{cite book|last=Tamura|first=Eileen H.|year=2013|title=In Defense of Justice: Joseph Kurihara and the Japanese American Struggle for Equality|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252037788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1481(a)(6) became inoperative after World War II, and was thought to have remained so during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="A18168808"&gt;{{cite case|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2012/08/27/2039.pdf|litigants=Matter of Jolley|vol=13|reporter=I. &amp; N.

Donald]] derided as a "popular myth among prisoners" that renouncing citizenship would allow early release in exchange for deportation to another country. Courts consistently ruled that 1481(a)(6) was inoperative because the U.S. was not in a "state of war", until 2008 when James Kaufman of Wisconsin won a ruling from the DC District Court that the U.S. was indeed in a "state of war" and that the [[Department of Homeland Security]] was responsible for administering 1481(a)(6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2003/jul/15/no-right-to-renounce-citizenship-us-not-quotat-warquot/|title=No Right to Renounce Citizenship; U.S. Not 'at War'|work=Prison Legal News|date=July 15, 2003|accessdate=June 16, 2017}} {{cite news|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202457435187&amp;DOJ_Challenges_Sex_Offenders_Effort_to_Renounce_Citizenship&amp;slreturn=20130530112536|first=Mike|last=Scarcella|title=DOJ Challenges Sex Offender's Effort to Renounce Citizenship|work=The National Law Journal|date=2010-04-30|accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Justice abandoned its appeal against this ruling for unstated reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202470006780&amp;slreturn=20130530112538|first=Mike|last=Scarcella|title=DOJ Abandons Challenge of Sex Offender's Desire to Renounce Citizenship|work=The National Law Journal|date=2010-08-18|accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further attempts by prisoners to renounce under 1481(a)(6) continued to be stymied by a [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] policy that applicants had to attend an in-person interview and demonstrate that they could leave the U.S. immediately upon approval of renunciation.&lt;ref name="DUSPIL2012"&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/211872.pdf|chapter=Chapter 1: Nationality, Citizenship, and Immigration|title=Digest of United States Practice in International Law|publisher=Department of State|location=Washington, D.C.|year=2012|pages=22–25|accessdate=2014-07-02}} {{cite news|url=https://blogs.findlaw.com/dc_circuit/2014/08/sd-prisoner-can-try-to-renounce-citizenship-from-behind-bars.html|first=Mark|last=Wilson|title=S.D.

===Treason, rebellion, or similar crimes===

{{USCSub|8|1481|a|7}} provides that commission of certain crimes may be regarded as a relinquishing act, if one is convicted of those crimes. The original list in Section 349(a)(9) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 included only treason, bearing arms against the U.S., or attempting to overthrow the U.S. by force. The Expatriation Act of 1954, motivated by fears of communism in the United States, added additional crimes to this list, namely the crime of advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government as defined by the [[Smith Act]] of 1940, as well as the crimes of [[seditious conspiracy]] and [[rebellion]] or [[insurrection]] as proscribed by the [[Crimes Act of 1909]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=794190|first=Stephen F.|last=Pollak|title=The Expatriation Act of 1954|journal=The Yale Law Journal|volume=64|number=8|pages=1164-1200}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provision is known to have been applied to Tomoya Kawakita, whose conviction for treason was upheld by the Supreme Court in ''[[Kawakita v. United States]]'' (1952). Kawakita had his death sentence commuted to life imprisonment in 1953, and in 1963 received a conditional pardon in exchange for his deportation to Japan. As of 1991, the constitutionality of this provision had not been tested in the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelly|1991|p=431, 447}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s and 2010s, there were proposals to add additional terrorism-related crimes to the list of those causing loss of citizenship, such as the [[Enemy Expatriation Act]] in 2011, but these failed to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://scholarship.law.stjohns.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1727&amp;context=jcred|first=Lauren|last=Prunty|title=The Terrorist Expatriation Act: Unconstitutional and Unnecessary|journal=Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development|volume=26|issue=4|date=June 2013|page=1009|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal treatment of former citizens==

===Taxation===

{{main|Expatriation tax#United States}}

Special tax provisions began targeting former U.S. citizens in the 1960s. The Foreign Investors Tax Act of 1966, which provided that foreigners who invested in the United States would not have to pay [[capital gains tax in the United States|capital gains tax]], denied this tax break to people who had relinquished U.S. citizenship within the past ten years and whom the IRS determined to have relinquished for the purpose of avoiding U.S. taxation. This was intended to ensure that U.S. citizens did not relinquish citizenship for the purpose of accessing those tax breaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&amp;context=wmblr|first=William L.|last=Dentino|first2=Christine|last2=Manolakas|title=The Exit Tax: A Move in the Right Direction|journal=William &amp; Mary Business Law Review|volume=3|issue=2|page=350|year=2012|accessdate=April 16, 2018}} {{cite web|url=http://www.finance.senate.gov/library/reports/committee/download/?id=4ee7ee42-2874-4976-8161-00919c85e474|title=Foreign Investors Tax Act of 1966; Presidential Election Fund Act; and other amendments|publisher=[[United States Senate Committee on Finance]]|date=1966-10-11|accessdate=2014-06-04|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These provisions were rarely enforced due to their vagueness. In the early 1990s an article in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine sparked renewed public interest in the issue of wealthy individuals giving up citizenship in order to avoid U.S. taxation, who were estimated to make up roughly a dozen of the one thousand individuals per year giving up U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref name="NYT19951001"&gt;{{cite news|first=Karen|last=De Witt|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEED81E3EF932A35753C1A963958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Exile's Effort to Return Puts Focus on Tax Loophole|work=The New York Times|date=1995-10-01|accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] of 1996 (HIPAA) enacted concrete criteria under which an ex-citizen would be presumed a "covered expatriate" who gave up U.S. status for tax reasons, based on the person's income and assets, ({{USCSub|26|877|a|2}}), and required such citizens to file additional tax forms to certify their compliance with the new provisions ({{USC|26|6039G}}). Dual citizens at birth and young people who relinquished citizenship before the age of 18½ were exempt from "covered expatriate" status, subject to some restrictions including limited physical presence in the United States.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;{{USCSub|26|877|a|2}}. In both cases, this exemption was conditional on not being present in the U.S. "for more than 30 days during any calendar year which is 1 of the 10 calendar years preceding the individual’s loss of United States citizenship". Additionally, a dual citizen had to meet the requirement that he or she "was never a resident of the United States" and "has never held a United States passport", while a young person relinquishing within six months of their 18th birthday would only be exempted from covered expatriate status if "neither parent of such individual was a citizen of the United States" at the time of the person's birth.&lt;/ref&gt; The law also extended the expatriation tax to cover ex-permanent residents as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.capdale.com/files/14701_The%20Current%20State%20of%20Expatriation.pdf|first=Michael G.|last=Pfeifer|title=The Current State of Expatriation|journal=ALI CLE Estate Planning Course Materials Journal|date=December 2014|page=3, 9|accessdate=2017-10-31|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Discretionary exceptions to this tax, in particular the system of obtaining a [[private letter ruling]] (PLR) that one's relinquishment of citizenship was not motivated by taxation, fueled perceptions that it was ineffective at addressing tax-motivated relinquishment of citizenship, and sparked further amendments in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Worster|2010|p=936}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Jobs Creation Act of 2004]] terminated the PLR exception to the tax on covered expatriates and taxed those who stayed in the U.S. for more than thirty days in any of the first ten years following relinquishment as though they remained a U.S. citizen for that year, while also classifying as "covered expatriates" people who relinquished citizenship or permanent residence but could not certify compliance with their tax filing and payment obligations for the past five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pfeifer|2014|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the Heroes Earnings Assistance Relief Tax Act (HEART Act) of 2008 repealed the ten-year system and imposed new taxes relating to covered expatriates, consisting of a one-time tax on worldwide accrued capital gains, calculated on a [[Mark-to-market accounting|mark-to-market]] basis, and an inheritance tax on bequests from covered expatriates to U.S. persons (equivalent to [[estate tax in the United States|estate tax]] with the exemption amount drastically lowered from $5.5 million to $13,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bna.com/ten-surprises-for-expatriates/|first=James D.|last=McCann|title=Ten Surprises for Expatriates|work=Bloomberg BNA|date=2013-10-17|accessdate=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HEART Act also modified the criteria for dual citizens and people below the age of 18½ to be exempted from "covered expatriate" status.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For dual citizens, {{USCSub|26|877A|g|1|B}} adds the requires that the individual "is taxed as a resident of" the other country of citizenship, but does not require that the individual "has never held a United States passport". It also loosened the limits on residence in the U.S. compared to 877(a)(2), allowing an individual to qualify for the exemption from covered expatriate status if he or she "has been a resident of the United States ... for not more than 10 taxable years" within a certain period prior to the expatriation date.&lt;/ref&gt; The new certification requirement to avoid covered expatriate status means that even the poorest individuals renouncing citizenship could become subject to these taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.procopio.com/uploads/model/Block/4587/pdf/145/docs-1738595-v2-accidental-americans-and-the-push-to-renounce-us-citizenship-2448.pdf|first=Patrick|last=Martin|title='Accidental Americans' Rush to Renounce U.S. Citizenship to Avoid the Ugly U.S. Tax Web|publisher=Procopio, Cory, Hargreaves &amp; Savitch LLP|date=2012|access-date=2017-10-31|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, though tax filing is not a legal prerequisite to relinquishment of citizenship, this new exit tax system imposed significant disadvantages on people who relinquished citizenship without filing taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spiro|2017|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication of names===
{{main|Quarterly Publication of Individuals Who Have Chosen to Expatriate}}

In addition to the tax law changes, HIPAA included a provision to make the names of people who give up U.S. citizenship part of the public record by listing them in the ''[[Federal Register]]''. The sponsor of this provision, [[Sam Gibbons]] (D-FL), stated that it was intended to "name and shame" the people in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=552730|first=Michael S.|last=Kirsch|title=Alternative Sanctions and the Federal Tax Law: Symbols, Shaming, and Social Norm Management as a Substitute for Effective Tax Policy|journal=Iowa Law Review|volume=89|page=863|year=2004|accessdate=|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list does not appear to contain the names of all people who give up U.S. citizenship, though tax lawyers disagree whether that is because the list is only required to contain "covered expatriates", or due to bureaucratic errors or other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2014/05/03/americans-are-renouncing-citizenship-at-record-pace-and-many-arent-even-counted/|first=Robert|last=Wood|title=Record Numbers Renounce U.S. Citizenship — And Many Aren't Counted|work=Forbes|date=2014-05-03|accessdate=2014-05-29}} {{cite news|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/expat/2015/09/16/is-the-irs-undercounting-americans-renouncing-u-s-citizenship/|title=Is the IRS Undercounting Americans Renouncing U.S. Citizenship?|work=Wall Street Journal|date=2015-09-16|accessdate=2015-09-21}} {{cite book|chapterurl=http://intltax.typepad.com/intltax_blog/2014/02/quarterly-list-of-expatriates-source-of-data.html|chapter=Quarterly List of Expatriates: Source of Data|title=International Tax Blog|publisher=Andrew Mitchel LLC, Attorneys at Law|date=2014-02-12|accessdate=2014-02-13}} {{cite news|url=http://www.advisor.ca/news/industry-news/fbi-and-irs-differ-on-u-s-citizenship-data-107927|title=FBI and IRS differ on U.S. citizenship data|work=Advisor.ca|publisher=[[Rogers Media]]|date=2013-02-16|accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries such as Vietnam and South Korea also have provisions requiring publication of renunciation decisions in their respective [[government gazette]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.law.go.kr/%EB%B2%95%EB%A0%B9/%EA%B5%AD%EC%A0%81%EB%B2%95/(10275)|chapter=제17조(관보 고시)|script-title=ko:국적법 [시행 2010.5.4.] [법률 제10275호, 2010.5.4., 일부개정]|publisher=Ministry of Government Legislation|location=South Korea|date=May 4, 2010|accessdate=February 11, 2018|quote=① 법무부장관은 대한민국 국적의 취득과 상실에 관한 사항이 발생하면 그 뜻을 관보에 고시(告示)하여야 한다.

===Visas===

Two provisions of U.S. immigration law make some former citizens inadmissible, though only a small number of people are actually found inadmissible under those provisions each year. A finding of inadmissibility prevents a person from entering the U.S. either temporarily (under the [[Visa Waiver Program]] or a visitor or other visa) or permanently (as a lawful permanent resident), unless the person obtains a [[Waiver of Inadmissibility]].

The [[Reed Amendment (immigration)|Reed Amendment]] ({{USCSub|8|1182|a|10|E}}), which became law as part of the [[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act]] of 1996, attempted to make people who had renounced citizenship for the purpose of avoiding taxation by the United States inadmissible. The Department of Homeland Security indicated in a 2015 report that, due to laws protecting the privacy of tax information, the provision was effectively impossible to enforce unless the former citizen "affirmatively admits" his or her reasons for renouncing citizenship to an official at DHS or the State Department.&lt;ref name="Johnson2015"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Departmental%20Management%20and%20Operations%20%28DMO%29%20-%20Policy%20-%20Inadmissibility%20of%20Tax-Based%20Citizenship%20Renunciants_0.pdf|first=Jeh C.|last=Johnson|title=Inadmissibility of Tax-Based Citizenship Renunciants|series=Fiscal Year 2015 Report to Congress|publisher=Department of Homeland Security|location=Washington, DC|date=2015-11-30|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322190133/https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Departmental%20Management%20and%20Operations%20%28DMO%29%20-%20Policy%20-%20Inadmissibility%20of%20Tax-Based%20Citizenship%20Renunciants_0.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bipartisan efforts in the 2000s and 2010s to amend the tax information privacy laws to address this limitation all failed.&lt;ref name="McLemoreFraser2015"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.butlersnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/TPIR_UncleSam_0915.pdf|first1=Chris|last1=McLemore|first2=Erin|last2=Fraser|title=Uncle Sam Wants You (To Pay Tax): Breaking Up Is Hard To Do|journal=Tax Planning International Review|date=September 2015|issn=0309-7900|pages=3–7}} Cites for example the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of 2002, {{USBill|107|HR|5063}}, and the Senate Finance Committee report, [https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/107th-congress/senate-report/283/1 S.Rept. 107-283].&lt;/ref&gt; According to the State Department, no person was denied a U.S. visa due to inadmissibility under the Reed Amendment until Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017, in which a total of three visa applications were denied due to a finding of inadmissibility.

===Regaining citizenship through naturalization===

There is no specific provision of law which prevents a person who relinquished U.S. citizenship from regaining it again through naturalization, though conversely such individuals enjoy no special provisions to make the process easier either. They generally must qualify for lawful permanent resident (LPR) immigration status through the same process as any other alien, and must comply with the same requirements for naturalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.is/dkwgC|title=Voluntary Relinquishment of U.S. Citizenship|publisher=Murthy Law Firm|date=June 15, 2016|accessdate=April 12, 2018}} {{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Renunciaton-USCitizenship-persons-claiming-right-residence.html|title=Renunciation of U.S. Citizenship by persons claiming right of residence in the United States|website=travel.state.gov|publisher=Department of State|location=United States|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WorldJournal2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://la.worldjournal.com/bookmark/16719776-%E6%94%BE%E6%A3%84%E7%BE%8E%E7%B1%8D-%E5%86%8D%E5%BE%A9%E7%B1%8D%E4%B8%8D%E9%9B%A3|title=台灣政要放棄美國籍,只是政治遊戲 專家:想恢復並不難|trans-title=Taiwanese politicians' renunciation of U.S. citizenship is just a political game; experts say regaining it isn't hard|work=World Journal|date=9 December 2011|archiveurl=http://www.wenxuecity.com/news/2011/12/09/1561555_print.html|archivedate=9 December 2011|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special exceptions apply to women who lost citizenship under the [[Expatriation Act of 1907]] by marrying a non-citizen, and to people who lost citizenship through service in Allied armed forces during World War II: such people can obtain special LPR status (under SC-1 and SC-2 visas) and apply for renaturalization without any required period of residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|8|1435|1438}} The names of the visas are listed in {{cite book|chapterurl=https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/FY2003%20AppF.pdf|chapter=Appendix F: Immigrant and Nonimmigrant Visa Symbols|title=Report of the Visa Office for Fiscal Year 2003|publisher=Department of State|location=United States|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Department has not issued any SC-1 or SC-2 visas at least since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;"Table IX: Special Immigrant Visas Issued for Fiscal Years [https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/FY2000%20table%20IX.pdf 2000], [https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/FY2001%20table%20IX.pdf 2001], [https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/FY2002%20table%20IX.pdf 2002], [https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/FY2003%20table%20IX.pdf 2003], [https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/FY04tableIX.pdf 2004], [https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/FY05tableIX.pdf 2005], [https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/FY06AnnualReportTableIX.pdf 2006], [https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/FY07AnnualReportIX.pdf 2007], [https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/FY08-AR-TableIX.pdf 2008], [https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/FY09AnnualReport_TableIX.pdf 2009], [https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/FY10AnnualReport-TableIX.pdf 2010], [https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/AnnualReports/FY2011AnnualReport/FY11AnnualReport-Table%20IX.pdf 2011], [https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/AnnualReports/FY2012AnnualReport/FY12AnnualReport-TableIX.pdf 2012], [https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/AnnualReports/FY2013AnnualReport/FY13AnnualReport-TableIX.pdf 2013], [https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/AnnualReports/FY2014AnnualReport/FY14AnnualReport-TableIX.pdf 2014], [https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/AnnualReports/FY2015AnnualReport/FY15AnnualReport-TableIX.pdf 2015], [https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/AnnualReports/FY2016AnnualReport/FY16AnnualReport-TableIX.pdf 2016], and [https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/AnnualReports/FY2017AnnualReport/FY17AnnualReport-TableIX.pdf 2017]".

One provision of the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] (codified at {{USCSub|18|922}}) criminalizes firearms purchases by, and firearms sales to, people who have renounced United States citizenship. This provision, along with similar treatment for people adjudged mentally defective or dishonorably [[military discharge|discharged]] from the U.S. Armed Forces, and a restriction on mail-order firearms sales, was aimed at preventing a repeat of the circumstances which allowed [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] to obtain [[John F.

The [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (ATF) interprets the word "renounced" in this provision of law to apply only to persons who swore an oath of renunciation U.S. citizenship before a designated U.S. government official, and not those who committed other relinquishing acts. ATF further stated that a court appeal which reverses a renunciation also removes firearms disabilities, but that a renunciant who subsequently obtains United States citizenship again through naturalization would continue to be barred from purchasing firearms. Under the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act]] of 1993, individuals who are barred from purchasing firearms due to this provision or other provisions of the same law have their names entered into the [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{USCFR|27|478|11|}} and {{cite journal|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1997-06-27/html/97-16900.htm|author=John W.

The Safe Explosives Act (a portion of the [[Homeland Security Act]] of 2002) expanded the list of people who may not lawfully transport, ship, receive or possess explosive materials to include people who have renounced their U.S. citizenship. In 2003, ATF promulgated regulations under that act providing for a definition of renunciation of citizenship consistent with that under the regulations to the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the Brady Act of 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2003/03/20/03-6573/implementation-of-the-safe-explosives-act-title-xi-subtitle-c-of-public-law-107-296|title=Implementation of the Safe Explosives Act, Title XI, Subtitle C of Public Law 107-296|work=Federal Register|volume=68|number=54|pages=13767–13793|date=March 20, 2003|accessdate=June 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, aliens face restrictions on eligibility for payments based on their country of citizenship or residence, whereas U.S. citizens do not. Residents of countries which have a [[totalization agreement]] with the United States, as well as citizens of 53 other countries, can receive Social Security payments indefinitely while residing outside of the United States. Otherwise, Social Security benefit payments will stop after the alien has spent six full calendar months outside of United States, and cannot be resumed until the alien spends one full calendar month inside of the United States and is lawfully present for that entire month. U.S. citizens, in contrast, can receive Social Security payments outside of the U.S. regardless of their length of residence abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10137.pdf|title=Your Payments While You are Outside the United States|publisher=Social Security Administration|date=January 2017|accessdate=June 15, 2017}} {{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/expat/2015/07/28/on-social-security-benefits-for-former-u-s-green-card-holders/|first=Chad|last=Creveling|first2=Peggy|last2=Creveling|title=On Social Security Benefits for Former U.S. Green Card Holders|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 28, 2015|accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the filing of [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation|SLAPP]] suits. The official church response is that its litigious nature is solely to protect its [[copyright]]ed works and the [[trade secret|unpublished status]] of certain documents.

Various critics of the Church of Scientology have characterized the organization as a [[confidence trick|confidence scam]] and claim that these secretive writings are proof, or allege that they contain evidence that the Church of Scientology's medical practices are [[law|illegal]] and [[fraudulent]].&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Jacobsen, Jeff. [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/NOTs/medical/jacobsen-medical.txt "Medical claims within Scientology's secret teachings"], 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Mike.

Others have claimed that the Church of Scientology is [[Copyright misuse|abusing copyright law]] by launching lawsuits against outspoken critics.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, see Hausherr, Tilman.

== alt.religion.scientology ==
Scott Goehring set up the [[newsgroup]] ''[[alt.religion.scientology]]'' in 1991, partly as a joke, partly for the purpose of informing the public about Scientology.&lt;ref name="Net.Wars"/&gt; Debate over the pros and cons of Scientology waxed and waned on the newsgroup through the first three years of its existence, and [[Flaming (Internet)|flame wars]] flared up commonly, as they did on some other newsgroups.&lt;ref name="alt.scientology.war" /&gt;

The online battle is generally regarded as having begun with the arrival of Dennis Erlich to ''alt.religion.scientology'' in late July 1994. A former high-ranking official in the Scientology organization who had been personally affiliated with L. Ron Hubbard, he caused a number of regular participants in the newsgroup to sit up and take notice.&lt;ref name="Net.Wars"/&gt;{{Rp|4, 6}}&lt;ref name="alt.scientology.war"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Xenu revelation ===
On December 24, 1994, the first of a large number of anonymous messages was posted to ''alt.religion.scientology'', containing the text of the [[Scientology beliefs and practices#Confidential materials and reincarnation|"secret" writings of Scientology]] known as the ''[[Operating Thetan|OT Levels]]'' (OT stands for "Operating Thetan"). Included among these postings was [[Xenu|OT III]] (''Operating Thetan Level Three''), which gave L. Ron Hubbard's description of the "[[Xenu]] story". The Xenu story had been published in the Robert Kaufman book ''[[Inside Scientology: How I Joined Scientology and Became Superhuman]]'' in 1972, the ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' in 1977, and several times in the 1980s in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology/msg/d24819df480c74bb?hl=en&amp;dmode=source The Un-Funny Truth about ARS] alt.religion.scientology, 3 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless, this action brought on the actions of lawyers representing Scientology, who contacted various newsgroup participants and posted warnings demanding that the unauthorized distribution of the OT writings cease. The lawyers described the documents as "copyrighted, [[trademark]]ed, unpublished trade secrets", and the distribution of the materials as a violation of [[copyright law]] and [[trademark law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Alan | last = Prendergast | title = Hunting rabbits, serving spam: The net under siege | url = http://www.westword.com/1995-10-04/news/hunting-rabbits-serving-spam-the-net-under-siege/full | work = [[Westword|Denver Westword]] | publisher = [[Village Voice Media]] | date = 1995-10-04 | accessdate = 2008-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first postings of the ''OT'' documents were done through an [[anonymous remailer]], and the identity of the person who made them available on the newsgroup was never discovered.  However, Dennis Erlich posted replies to these messages on the newsgroup, and his replies contained the entire text of the original messages (including the disputed materials).  Scientology's lawyers therefore approached him, declaring that Erlich had re-published the copyrighted works in his newsgroup messages.  Erlich's reply to this was to deny their requests to remove his postings from the newsgroup.

=== Attempt to remove ''alt.religion.scientology'' ===
On January 11, 1995, Scientology lawyer [[Helena Kobrin]] attempted to shut down the [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup|discussion group]] ''alt.religion.scientology'' by sending a control message instructing Usenet servers to delete the group on the grounds that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) It was started with a forged message; (2) not discussed on [[alt.config]]; (3) it has the name "scientology" in its title which is a trademark and is misleading, as a.r.s. is mainly used for flamers to attack the Scientology religion; (4) it has been and continues to be heavily abused with copyright and trade secret violations and serves no purpose other than condoning these illegal practices.&lt;ref name="Net.Wars"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grossman | first = Wendy | title = Net.Wars | url = http://www.nyupress.org/netwars/ | accessdate = 2006-06-11 | publisher = New York University Press | location = New York | isbn = 0-8147-3103-1 | pages = 77–78 | chapter = Copyright Terrorists | chapterurl = http://www.nyupress.org/netwars/textonly/pages/chapter06/ch06_.html |date=October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/cos/rnewman/usenet/rmgroup |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050824091341/http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/cos/rnewman/usenet/rmgroup |archivedate=2005-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In practice, this [[rmgroup message]] had little effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/cos/rnewman/usenet/rmgroup.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120172417/http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/cos/rnewman/usenet/rmgroup.html |archivedate=2008-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; since most Usenet servers are configured to disregard such messages when applied to groups that receive substantial traffic, and [[newgroup message]]s were quickly issued for those servers that did not do so. However, the issuance of the message resulted in increased public criticism of Scientology by [[free-speech]] advocates.

== Raids and lawsuits ==
Shortly after the initial legal announcements and ''rmgroup'' attempt, representatives of Scientology followed through with a series of [[lawsuit]]s against various participants on the newsgroup, including Dennis Erlich, in ''[[Religious Technology Center v. Netcom]]''. The first raid took place on February 13, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaink.net/cos/rnewman/erlich/home.html|title=The Church of Scientology vs. Dennis Erlich, Tom Klemesrud &amp; Netcom|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accompanied by Scientology lawyers, federal marshals made several raids on the homes of individuals who were accused of posting Scientology's copyrighted materials to the newsgroup. Raids took place against [[Arnaldo Lerma]] ([[Virginia]]),&lt;ref name="gospeloftheweb"&gt;{{cite news | first = Nick | last = Ryan | title = The Gospel of the Web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/mar/23/religion.internet |newspaper = [[The Guardian]]; Technology | date = 2000-03-23 | accessdate = 2007-10-12 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence A. Wollersheim]] and Robert Penny of [[Fight Against Coercive Tactics Network|FACTNet]] ([[Colorado]]), and Dennis Erlich ([[California]]). Internationally, raids took place against [[Karin Spaink]] (The Netherlands) and [[Zenon Panoussis]] (Sweden). In addition to filing lawsuits against individuals, Scientology also sued the ''[[Washington Post]]'' for reprinting one paragraph of the OT writings in a newspaper article, as well as several [[Internet service provider]]s, including [[Netcom (USA)|Netcom]], [[Tom Klemesrud]], and [[XS4ALL]]. It also regularly demanded the deletion of material from the [[Deja News]] archive.

Participants in ''alt.religion.scientology'' began using quotes from OT III in particular to publicize the online battle over the secret documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.xenu.net/archive/leaflet/ | title = The XENU Leaflet | publisher = Operation Clambake | format = download in various formats | author = [[Roland Rashleigh-Berry]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of [[Xenu]] was subsequently quoted in many publications, including news reports on [[CNN]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/US/9508/scientology/ | title = Church of Scientology protects secrets on the Internet |date=August 26, 1995 | publisher = [[CNN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[60 Minutes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lesley Stahl]], ''[[60 Minutes]]'', (December 28, 1997) "The Cult Awareness Network". [[CBS News]].&lt;/ref&gt; It became the most famous reference to the OT levels, to the point where many Internet users who were not intimately familiar with Scientology had heard the story of Xenu, and immediately associated the name with Scientology. The initial strikes against Scientology's critics settled down into a series of legal battles that raged through the courts. The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] provided legal assistance to defendant [[Tom Klemesrud]] and his attorney Richard Horning helped find Dennis Erlich ''pro bono'' defense.  Daily reports of the latest happenings were posted to ''alt.religion.scientology.''

In the wake of the Scientologist actions, the [[Penet remailer]], which had been the most popular [[anonymous remailer]] in the world until the Scientology "war" took place, was shut down. [[Johan Helsingius]], operator of the remailer, stated that the legal protections afforded him in his country (Finland) were too thin to protect the anonymity of his users and he decided to close down the remailer as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/cos/rnewman/anon/penet.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207122638/http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/cos/rnewman/anon/penet.html |archivedate=2008-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stalking&gt;{{cite web | first = Alan | last = Prendergast | title = Stalking the Net | url = http://www.westword.com/1995-10-04/news/stalking-the-net/full | work = [[Westword|Denver Westword News]] | publisher = [[Village Voice Media]] | date = 1995-10-04 | accessdate = 2008-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Sabine | last = Helmers | title = A Brief History of anon.penet.fi | url = http://www.december.com/cmc/mag/1997/sep/helmers.html | work =  | publisher = CMC Magazine | date = 1997-09-01 | accessdate = 2008-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientology's online campaign ==
After failing to remove the newsgroup, Scientologists adopted a strategy of newsgroup spam and intimidation.&lt;ref name="flames"&gt;{{cite news|first=Colman |last=Jones |title=Freedom Flames Out on the 'Net - Who launched the largest-ever sabotage of the Internet? |url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/15/44/News/feature.html |publisher=[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]] |date=1996-07-04 |accessdate=2006-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129101614/http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/15/44/News/feature.html |archivedate=2008-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientologists hired third parties to regularly flood the newsgroup with pro-scientology messages, vague anti-scientology messages, irrelevant comments, and accusations that other posters are secret Scientologists intent on tracking and punishing posters. This makes the newsgroup virtually unreadable via online readers such as [[Google Groups]], although more specialized newsreading software that can filter out all messages by specific "high noise" posters make the newsgroup more usable.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

While legal battles were being fought in the courts, an equally intense and aggressive campaign was waged online. The newsgroup ''alt.religion.scientology'' found itself at the heart of an electronic maelstrom of information and [[disinformation]], as the newsgroup itself was attacked both literally and figuratively. Tens of thousands of junk messages were [[spamming|spammed]] onto the newsgroup, rendering it nearly unreadable at times when the message "floods" were at their peaks.&lt;ref name="flames"/&gt; Over one million [[sporgery]] articles were injected into the newsgroup by Scientology management and staff; former Scientology staff member [[Tory Christman]] has spoken at length about her involvement in these attacks. Lawyers representing the Church of Scientology made public appeals to Internet service providers to remove the newsgroup completely from their news servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.discord.org/~lippard/skeptic/03.3.jl-jj-scientology.html | title=Scientology v. the Internet: Free Speech &amp; Copyright Infringement on the Information Super-Highway | work=[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|''Skeptic'']] | publisher=[[The Skeptics Society]] | volume=3 | issue=3 | year=1995 | pages=35–41 | author=Lippard, Jim | authorlink=Jim Lippard | author2=Jacobsen, Jeff | accessdate=August 9, 2009 | postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, anonymous participants in the newsgroup kept up a steady stream of [[flame wars]] and off-topic arguments. Participants on the newsgroup accused Scientology of organising these electronic attacks, though the organization consistently denied any wrongdoing.

In the early days of the [[World Wide Web]], groups associated with Scientology employed a similar strategy to make finding websites critical of the organization more difficult. Scientology employed Web designers to write thousands of Web pages for their site, thus flooding early [[Web search engine|search engine]]s.&lt;ref name="Web of their own"/&gt;  This problem was solved by the innovation of clustering responses from the same [[Web server]], showing no more than the top two results from any one site.

Since 1995, Scientology has utilized copyright infringement laws to prosecute critics posting controversial information about the organisation on the Web. The organization has been accused of utilizing not only legal pressure, but also [[blackmail]] and [[character assassination]] in an attempt to win many of the court cases in which it involves itself.&lt;ref name="erlichfree"&gt;Freedom Magazine, Vol 27, Issue 4: [https://web.archive.org/web/19990116234531/http://www.theta.com/goodman/crime.htm ''A Crime By Any Other Name'']. See "Dennis Erlich: Copyright Terrorist". (Archived January 16th, 1999.)&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other side of the battle, many Web-page developers have linked the words "Dianetics" and "Scientology" to [[Operation Clambake]]. This resulted in the anti-Scientology site having the highest Google index on the term for a while, which in turn resulted in Scientology persuading Google to remove links to the site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author1= Matt Loney |author2= Evan Hansen | title = Google pulls anti-Scientology links | url = http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-865936.html | publisher = [[CNet]] | date = 2002-03-21 | accessdate = 2006-12-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707014044/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-865936.html|archivedate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; until international outcry led to the links being restored. This might be considered an early example of a [[Google bomb]], and has led to questions about the power and obligations of Internet search providers.

In the 1990s Scientology was distributing a [[Content-control software|special software package]] for its members to [[Internet censorship|'protect']] them from "unapproved" material about the church. The software is designed to completely block out the newsgroup ''alt.religion.scientology'', various anti-Scientology web sites, and all references to various critics of Scientology. This software package was derided by critics, who accused the organization of censorship and called the program "[[Scieno Sitter]]", after the [[content-control software]] net-filter program Cyber Sitter. Since no updates have been reported since 1998 (and the original filter program only worked with [[Windows 95]]) the package is unlikely to be in use with recent operating systems and browsers due to [[software rot]].&lt;ref name="Web of their own"&gt;{{cite news|first=Janelle |last=Brown |url=http://www.salon.com/1998/07/15/feature_299/ |title=A Web of their own |work=Salon |publisher=Salon.com |date=1998-07-15 |accessdate=2006-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, Scientology lawyers sent cease-and-desist letters to [[Max Goldberg]], founder of the website [[YTMND]], asking him to take down all sites that either talked about or mocked Scientology, which had recently become a fad on the site following [[Trapped in the Closet (South Park episode)|a popular ''South Park'' episode]]. Goldberg responded by stating that the "claims are completely groundless and I'm not removing anything," adding to the members of the site, "it should only be a matter of time before we're sued out of existence." In response, YTMNDers created yet more sites about Scientology, and these were highlighted on the main page. They also campaigned to [[Google bomb]] "The Unfunny Truth About Scientology" site. No legal action was taken against YTMND or Goldberg.

In August 2007, [[MSNBC]] quoted [[Associated Press]] in an article on the [[Wikipedia Scanner]], that computers owned by the Church of Scientology [[Church of Scientology editing on Wikipedia|have been removing criticism]] in the Scientology entry on Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20284811/ New online tool traces Wikipedia edits: PCs in Scientology officialdom removed criticism in church's entry], ''[[MSNBC]]'', [[Associated Press]], [[Brian Bergstein]], August 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Fox News]] article also reported that Church of Scientology computers had been used to delete references of the relationship between Scientology and the [[Cult Awareness Network]], in the article on the Cult Awareness Network on Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,293389,00.html Wal-Mart, CIA, ExxonMobil Changed Wikipedia Entries], August 16, 2007, [[Fox News]], Rhys Blakely, Fox News Network, LLC.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee decided to restrict access to its site from Church of Scientology IP addresses, to prevent self-serving edits by Scientologists.&lt;ref name="Huff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/29/wikipedia-bans-scientolog_n_208967.html|last=Shea|first=Danny|title=Wikipedia Bans Scientology From Site|date=2009-05-29|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Metz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/05/29/wikipedia_bans_scientology/|title=Wikipedia bans Church of Scientology|last=Metz|first=Cade|date=2009-05-29|work=The Register|accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "host of anti-Scientologist editors" were topic-banned as well.&lt;ref name="Huff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Metz" /&gt; The committee concluded that both sides had "gamed policy" and resorted to "battlefield tactics", with articles on living persons being the "worst casualties".&lt;ref name="Huff" /&gt;

In early 2008, another protest against the Church of Scientology was organized by the Internet-based [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], which originally consisted of users of the English speaking [[imageboard]] [[4chan]] and forums such as Somethingawful.com, and several [[Internet Relay Chat]] channels, among other Internet-based communities claiming affiliation with Anonymous.

Posting entire books and hundreds of pages of published works is not 'Sunshine Policy' but wholesale copyright infringement."&lt;ref name=Fox /&gt; [[Julian Assange]] replied: "We thought it was a small issue, and our normal fare is government corruption and military secrets, so it seemed that this nutty religious organization was pretty inconsequential in terms of what we normally do. But after receiving these legal threats from them ... it was time for us to make a stand."&lt;ref name=Fox /&gt;

== Notable legal actions ==
{{See also|Scientology and law}}

A few of the court cases ended with rulings in favor of Scientology, though most of the cases were settled out of court. Many cases have been criticized as examples of malicious litigation and its members and lawyers have been indicted and fined for such actions. Noteworthy incidents in the later years of the online war included:

* Scientology's lawsuit against ex-member [[Arnaldo Lerma]], his provider Digital Gateway, and ''The Washington Post.'' Lerma posted the [[Fishman Affidavit]] that contained 61 pages including the story of [[Xenu]], a story simultaneously denied and claimed as a trade secret by the Church of Scientology.&lt;ref name="Net.Wars"/&gt;{{Rp|9
}}
* Zenon Panoussis, a resident of Sweden, was also sued for posting Scientology's copyrighted materials to the Internet. In his defense, he used a provision of the [[Constitution of Sweden]] that guarantees access to public documents. Panoussis turned over a copy of the NOTs documents to the office of the [[Swedish Parliament]] and, by law, copies of all documents (with few exceptions) received by authorities are available for anyone from the public to see, at any time he or she wishes. This, known as the Principle of Public Access (''Offentlighetsprincipen''), is considered a basic civil right in Sweden. The case, however, was decided against Panoussis. The results of his case sparked a legal firestorm in Sweden that debated the necessity of re-writing part of the Constitution.&lt;ref name="ShortTake"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://news.cnet.com/Short+Take+Scientologists+win+Net+court+case/2110-1023_3-215586.html |title = Short Take: Scientologists win Net court case |accessdate = 2007-08-10 |last = Macavinta |first = Courtney|date = 1998-09-15|work = [[CNET]]|publisher =|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104092708/http://news.cnet.com/Short-Take-Scientologists-win-Net-court-case/2110-1023_3-215586.html|archivedate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ScientologistSettle"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://news.cnet.com/Scientologists+settle+legal+battle/2100-1023_3-223683.html?tag=item |title = Scientologists settle legal battle |accessdate = 2007-08-10 |last = Macavinta |first = Courtney|date = 1999-03-30|work = [[CNET]]|publisher =|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103052054/http://news.cnet.com/Scientologists-settle-legal-battle/2100-1023_3-223683.html|archivedate=2012-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1995 Scientology caused a raid on the servers of Dutch Internet provider [[XS4ALL]] and sued it and [[Karin Spaink]] for copyright violations arising from published excerpts from confidential materials.

* Activist [[Keith Henson]] was sued for posting a portion of Scientology's writings to the Internet.

The court found that Henson had committed copyright infringement, and the damage award against Henson was immense: $75,000, an amount which Scientology said was the largest damages ever awarded against an individual for copyright infringement. Henson's case became increasingly more complex and ongoing, with a misdemeanor conviction of interfering with religion in [[Riverside County, California]]. In his Internet writings, Henson said that he was forced to flee the United States and seek [[political asylum|asylum]] in Canada due to ongoing threats against him.&lt;ref name="Net.Wars"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_6320693 |title = Scientology critic seeks pardon |accessdate = 2007-08-11|last = Zapler|first = Mike |date = 2007-07-07|work = [[San Jose Mercury News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|10}}
* Scientology was one of the first organizations to make use of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA). In June 1999, Scientology used the controversial law to force [[AT&amp;T Worldnet]] to reveal the identity of a person who had been posting anonymously to ''alt.religion.scientology'' with the pseudonym of "Safe".&lt;ref name="UnSafe"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-226676.html |title = Scientology subpoenas Worldnet |accessdate = 2007-08-10|last = Goodin|first = Dan |date = 1999-06-03|work = [[CNET]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616205921/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-226676.html|archivedate=2011-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In March 2001, legal threats from Scientology lawyers forced [[Slashdot]] to remove text from one of its discussion boards, after an excerpt from [[Xenu|OT III]] was posted there. Slashdot noted this as the first time a comment had to be removed from its system due to copyright concerns, and retaliated by posting a list of links to anti-Scientology websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://slashdot.org/yro/01/03/16/1256226.shtml |title = Scientologists Force Comment Off Slashdot |accessdate = 2007-09-05|date = 2001-03-16|work = [[Slashdot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The organization also used the DMCA to force the [[Google]] search engine to erase its entries on the controversial anti-Scientology Web site ''[[Operation Clambake]]'' in March 2002, though the entry was reinstated after Google received a large number of complaints from Internet users. The publicity stemming from this incident led Google to begin submitting DMCA takedown notices it received to the [[Chilling Effects]] archive, which archives legal threats of all sorts made against Internet users and Internet sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5997|title=Google Begins Making DMCA Takedowns Public|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Silence"/&gt;
* In September 2002, lawyers for Scientology contacted [[Internet Archive]] (archive.org), the administrators of the [[Internet Archive#Wayback Machine|Wayback Machine]] and asserted copyright claims on certain materials archived as historical contents of the [[Operation Clambake]] site. In response, the Wayback Machine administration removed the archive of the ''entire'' Clambake site, initially posting a false claim that the site's author had requested its removal. This claim has been removed but (as of February 2017) the site still returns a "Blocked Site Error" from the Wayback archive.&lt;ref name="Silence"&gt;{{cite web | first = Lisa M.| last = Bowman| title = Net archive silences Scientology critic| url = http://www.news.com/2100-1023-959236.html| publisher = [[CNET]] | date = 2002-09-24| accessdate = 2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''scope of review''' refers generally to the [[rights|right]] to have an issue raised on [[appeal]]. Which essentially entails whether an issue was preserved by or available to an [[appellant]] on appeal.

For example, in the [[United States]], a party can preserve an issue for appeal by raising an [[Objection (law)|objection]] at [[trial (law)|trial]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2358">In [[English law]], '''seignory''' or '''seigniory''' ([[French language|French]] ''seigneur'', lord; [[Latin]] ''senior'', elder), is the lordship (authority) remaining to a [[grantor]] after the grant of an estate in [[fee simple]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Seignory |volume=24 |page=586 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Nulle terre sans seigneur]]'' ("No land without a lord") was a [[feudalism|feudal]] [[legal maxim]]; where no other lord can be discovered, [[the Crown]] is lord as [[lord paramount]]. The principal incidents of a seignory were a feudal oath of [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and [[fealty]]; a [[Quit-rent|"quit" or "chief" rent]]; a "relief" of one year's quit rent, and the right of [[escheat]]. In return for these privileges the lord was liable to forfeit his rights if he neglected to protect and defend the tenant or did anything injurious to the feudal relation.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Every seignory now existing must have been created before the statute ''[[Quia Emptores]]'' (1290), which forbade the future creation of estates in fee-simple by [[subinfeudation]]. The only seignories of any importance at present are the [[Lord of the manor|lordships of manors]]. They are regarded as incorporeal [[hereditament]]s, and are either appendant or in gross. A seignory appendant passes with the grant of the manor; a seignory in gross—that is, a seignory which has been severed from the [[demesne]] lands of the manor to which it was originally appendant—must be specially conveyed by deed of grant.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[Fee simple|Freehold]] land may be enfranchised by a [[Conveyancing|conveyance]] of the seignory to the freehold tenant, but it does not extinguish the tenant's right of common (''Baring v. Abingdon'', 1892, 2 Ch. 374). By s. 3 (ii.) of the Settled Land Act 1882, the tenant for life of a manor is empowered to sell the seignory of any freehold land within the manor, and by s. 21 (v.) the purchase of the seignory of any part of settled land being freehold land, is an authorized application of capital money arising under the act.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

A '''statutory employee''' is an [[independent contractor]] under American [[common law]] who is treated as an employee, by [[statute]], for purposes of [[tax withholding]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See generally [[Internal Revenue Code]] section 3121(d)(3), at {{usc|26|3121}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For a standard independent contractor, an employer cannot withhold taxes. Statutory employees are also permitted to deduct work-related expenses on [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] [[IRS tax forms|Schedule C]] instead of [[IRS tax forms|Schedule A]] in the [[Taxation in the United States|United States tax system]]. As a result, they are allowed a greater tax deduction for business expenses than standard employees, as Schedule C expenses are not subject to the 2% [[adjusted gross income]] threshold as seen with Schedule A.&lt;ref name="irs"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Statutory-Employees|title= Statutory Employees|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= IRS.gov|accessdate=Jan 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Criteria==
For an individual to be considered a statutory employee, all of the following conditions must apply:&lt;ref name="irs"/&gt;
{{Ordered list|Services must be personally performed by the individual.|The individual does not have substantial investment in the equipment and property used to perform the services.|The services are performed on a continuing basis for the same payer.}}

Some examples of persons who may be considered statutory employees are as follows:&lt;ref name="irs"/&gt;

{{Ordered list |A driver distributing non-dairy beverages, meat, vegetable, fruit, or baked goods; or who picks up laundry, if he acts as an agent or is paid by commission.|A life insurance agent whose main business is life insurance and annuity for one company.|Someone who works from home on materials an employer supplies, that must be returned and for which the employer gives work specifications.|A traveling salesperson who turns in orders from wholesalers, retailers, contractors, hotels, or restaurants, either for resale or business use. Work performed must be the principal business activity of the employee.}}

==Advantages over standard employee==
Statutory employees occupy an intermediate position between [[employees]] and [[independent contractors]] from the perspective of the employer. Statutory employees are less expensive to hire than regular employees because the employer does not have to pay unemployment taxes. However, such employees are more expensive to hire than independent contractors because [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] taxes must be paid on wages in the form of [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA tax]].&lt;ref name="irs"/&gt; Statutory employees pay FICA tax through their employer, and so do not pay self-employment tax; despite this, they must report expenses, income and wage.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last = Brabec|first= Barbara|authorlink=|title=How to Maximize Schedule C Deductions &amp; Cut Self-Employment Taxes to the BONE -|publisher=Barbara Brabec Productions |date=Nov 26, 2014 |location=| pages=107|isbn= 978-0985633318|doi=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to independent contractors, statutory employees may deduct business expense from [[IRS tax forms|W-2]] earnings.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

The '''sum of public power''' ({{lang-es|Suma del poder público}}) is a legal term from Argentina, included in [[Constitution of Argentina|its constitution]]. It represents the sum of the [[Separation of powers|three powers]], and deems the complete delegation of them into the [[Executive (government)|executive power]] as a crime of [[high treason]].

The term was created in 1835, when governor [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] was granted such powers by the legislature of Buenos Aires. [[Justo José de Urquiza]] led an army to depose Rosas in order to enact a Constitution, which Rosas had delayed for years, and the 1853 Constitution legally forbade such a thing from happening again.

==Historical context==
The death of the federalist caudillo [[Facundo Quiroga]] caused great concern in the [[Argentine Confederation]], and soon the legislature of Buenos Aires elected Rosas as governor. A law from Augusto 3, 1821, allowed the legislature to grant those powers.&lt;ref name="Galvez32"&gt;Jaime Galvez, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Those powers were fully delegated on him, with the sole exceptions of keeping, defending and protecting the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and keeping and defending the cause of the Confederation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/documentos/epoca_de_rosas/decreto_concediendo_poder_publico_a_rosas.php Decreto concediendo la suma del poder público a Rosas] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[term of office]] of the governor, of three years, was extended to five years. The legislature reelected Rosas three times, allowing him three full mandates of 5 years, being overthrown during the fourth. Rosas could use the sum of public power during any time period he deemed convenient during his mandate.&lt;ref name="Galvez32"/&gt;

To confirm the legitimacy of his mandate, Rosas requested a vote to approve or reject him. Although there was no [[universal suffrage]] in Argentina by then, Rosas requested that all the people in Buenos Aires was allowed to vote, regardless of wealth or social conditions. This proposal was influenced by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[The Social Contract]]''. The only ones who could not vote were the women, the slaves, children under 20 years old (unless [[Emancipation of minors|emancipated]]) and foreigners without a stable residence in the country. The final result had 9720 votes for Rosas and only 8 against him.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime Galvez, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==
Although Rosas received the sum of public power, he did not became an [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]]. He still had a limited term of office, and the legislature and other [[republic]]an institutions were kept.&lt;ref name="Galvez38"&gt;Jaime Galvez, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not a [[Tyrant|tyranny]] either, as he did not have the usual traits of a tyranny. He did not took the power by an illegal way, such as a [[coup d'état]], but by an appointment of the legislature, and no law prevented the legislature from doing what it did. He did not become governor against the will of the population, as it was confirmed by a popular vote. He did not rule on behalf of a social minority, either.&lt;ref name="Galvez38"/&gt;

His appointment was in line with the ideas of Rousseau, who thought that "''If, on the other hand, the peril is of such a kind that the paraphernalia of the laws are an obstacle to their preservation, the method is to nominate a supreme ruler, who shall silence all the laws and suspend for a moment the sovereign authority. In such a case, there is no doubt about the general will, and it is clear that the people’s first intention is that the State shall not perish''".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; This principle influenced as well the concept of the [[state of emergency]], included in the 1853 constitution and in most legal systems around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime Gálvez, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actual usage==
Rosas did not fully use the powers invested in him. He did not close the legislature, which continued working during his rule. He was not interested in the tasks of the judiciary power, so he did not use any judiciary powers after the end of the trial about the death of [[Facundo Quiroga]]. Even more, the governor used to be the [[supreme court|highest court of appeal]] since the times of Spanish authority, so the legislature sanctioned a law in 1838 that established the "Tribunal Supremo de Recursos Extraordinarios", so that the highest court of the judiciary was still outside the executive power. Rosas gave his consent to the new law immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime Gálvez, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The delegation of the sum of public power on Rosas was highly controversial. [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] compared Rosas with other historical dictators in his work ''[[Facundo]]'', where he said as follows:

{{quote|Once being owner of absolute power, who will ask him for it later? Who will dare to dispute his titles to the domination? The Romans gave the dictatorship in rare cases and for short-term, fixed durations, and yet the use of temporary dictatorship allowed the perpetual one that destroyed the Republic and brought all the wildness of the Empire. When the term of government expires Rosas announces his resolute determination to retire to private life, the death of his beloved wife, his father, had ulcerated his heart and needs to go away from the tumult of public affairs to mourn the wide losses as bitter. The reader should recall hearing this language in the mouths of Rosas, that he had not seen his father since his youth, and whose wife had been such bitter days, something like the hypocritical protests of Tiberius to the Roman Senate. The Board of Buenos Aires pleads, begs him to continue making sacrifices for their country, Rosas is left to persuade, still only six months, spending six months and leaves the farce of the election. And indeed, what need has been elected a leader who has entrenched the power in his person? Who asks trembling from the terror that has inspired all of them?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/pbda/ensayo/facundo/facundo_14.htm Facundo]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the contrary, [[José de San Martín]] gave his full support to the delegation, on the grounds that the current situation in the country was so chaotic that it was needed to create order.

{{quote|Men do not live from dreams but from facts. What I care if it is repeated over and over again that I live in a country of liberty, if on the contrary, I'm being oppressed? Freedom!, Give it to a child of two years for enjoying by way of fun with a box of razor blades and you tell me the results. Freedom! So that if I devote myself to any kind of industry, comes a revolution that destroy the work of many years and the hope of leaving a loaf of bread for my children. Freedom! In order to charge me for contributions to pay the huge costs incurred, for four ambitious because they feel like, by way of speculation, making a revolution and go unpunished. Freedom! For the bad faith to found complete impunity as proved by the generality of bankruptcies ... this freedom, nor is the son of my mother going to enjoy the benefits it provides, until you see established a government that demagogues called tyrant, and protect me against the properties that freedom gives me today. Maybe you may tell that this letter is written in a good soldierly humor. You will be right, but you agree that at age 53 one can not admit that good faith will want to take for a ride ... Let this matter conclude and let me end by saying that the man who set the order of our country, whatever the means that for it employees, is the only one that would deserve the noble title of Liberator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desmemoria.8m.com/pasquali.htm San Martín Confidencial]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Constitutional status==
Rosas's mandate ended after his defeat at the [[Battle of Caseros]], and Urquiza called for the making of a National Constitution, which was written the following year, 1853. The 29º article explicitly forbids a delegation of powers such as the one done with Rosas to be performed.

{{quote|Congress can not give the National Executive, nor the provincial legislatures to governors of provinces, extraordinary powers, nor the sum of public power, nor may grant submission or supremacy whereby the life, the honor, or wealth of the Argentine people will be at mercy of governments or individual. Acts of this nature shall be utterly void, and shall render those who formulate, consent to or sign them, liable to be condemned as infamous traitors to the motherland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senado.gov.ar/web/interes/constitucion/capitulo1.php Constitución Nacional Argentina] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412110428/http://www.senado.gov.ar/web/interes/constitucion/capitulo1.php |date=2013-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the penalty for the 1835 release of the public power to Rosas is not affected by this ruling, as the Constitution was not established back then and had no [[ex post facto law]] provisions.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime Gálvez, pp. 36-37&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1746">'''Tag-along right''' ('''TAR''') is a legal concept in corporate law.

Under the concept, if the majority shareholder(s) of an entity sells their stake, the remaining [[Minority interest|minority shareholders]] have the right to join the deal and to sell their shares at the same terms and conditions as the majority shareholder(s), and the new owner must purchase those interests as well.

This right protects minority shareholders from being potentially forced to sell their shares for less than the majority shareholder(s) (as, after the deal, they likely would have no ability to outvote the new owner(s) who would have majority control).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tagalongrights.asp Tag-Along Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; Tag-along rights are fairly standard terms in [[shareholders agreement]]s.

The concept differs from the [[drag-along right]], in that under the latter the minority shareholders '''''must''''' sell their interests (though they also obtain the same terms and conditions as the majority shareholder).

'''''The Religion of the Future''''' is a book by the philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. In the book, he argues that humanity is in need of a religious revolution that dispenses with the concept of God and elements of the supernatural, a revolution that expands individual and collective human empowerment by fostering a condition he calls "deep freedom"—a life of creativity, risk, experiment, and meaningful personal connection—protected by structure-revising social and political structures of an [[empowered democracy]] hospitable to the context-breaking capacities inherent in human life.

==Overview==

===Background and objective===
Unger opens the book by describing the four incurable defects of human life: death, groundlessness, insatiability, and belittlement. The major world religious traditions, although having certain elements in common, have differed in how they have dealt with these four defects of human life. Unger describes three “moments” in the evolution of religious belief: a first moment, when human life was so precarious that the flaws of existence did not occupy a central place in human consciousness; a second moment, when humans had achieved some degree of freedom from dependence on nature, allowing high culture to emerge and address the basic flaws of existence, which were now at the center of human consciousness. A hallmark of this second moment of religious belief was the common feature of religion in assuring believers that everything is alright. For the third moment to occur, Unger argues that a religious revolution is needed, a thoroughly naturalistic development of religious belief which offers no assurance that everything is alright, but offers a heightened, intensified, and more meaningful life in the present, rather than at some indefinitely postponed future time. This “religion of the future” would offer a way of confronting life without illusions.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=1-61}}

In the next three chapters, Unger will address each of the three major world religious traditions and explain their shortcomings as inspiration and sources for the religion of the future.

===Critique of religious tradition of "overcoming the world"===
The religious tradition of overcoming the world, chiefly represented by [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], is marked by a quest for serenity and benevolence. Unger contends that “overcoming the world” cannot serve as a starting point for a future religious revolution, because this tradition seeks a deliberate dimming of consciousness and vitality in its quest for serenity. The religion of the future, Unger contends, must turn toward the world, not away from it, and a religious tradition that denies time and distinction, and urges us to turn away from engagement with the world, cannot be a basis for the religious revolution Unger envisions.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=62-89}}

===Critique of religious tradition of "humanizing the world"===
The tradition of humanizing the world (represented by [[Confucianism]]) is marked by a belief that humans can find their place in the world by embracing an ethic of roles and the ennoblement of our relations with each other through this ethic of roles. Unger contends that this tradition, too, is unsuited to be a starting point for the religion of the future because it gives too much weight and authority to social structures and roles that may match the dispositions only of the most virtuous, conformist members of society. The picture of human morality presented by the tradition of humanizing the world is ultimately unrealistic, Unger contends, and fails to address in a satisfactory manner the flaws in human existence.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=90-120}}

===Critique of religious tradition of "struggling with the world"===
According to Unger, the religious tradition that holds the most promise as a starting point for the religion of the future is the tradition of “struggling with the world,” the semitic salvific religions including [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. The tradition of “struggling with the world” also has a secular voice, in the form of the major doctrines of emancipation including [[liberalism]], [[socialism]] and [[democracy]]. The metaphysical vision of the various forms of “struggling with the world” include several points in common:
* There is one real world.
* Time is inclusively real.
* The new can happen.
* History is open.
* The self has unfathomable depth.
* The ordinary has more promise than the high-flown.

At the heart of the doctrine of the “struggle with the world,” both in its religious and secular variants, is a conception of the self as embodied spirit. Unger explains a key aspect of the nature of the embodied spirit is that it can always overflow and exceed its contexts: “There is more in us, in each of us individually and in all of us collectively--the human race--than there is or ever can be in them.” Unger explains how this context-transcending quality of human beings as embodied spirit is manifested in the context of the market economy, in areas of rigorous intellectual inquiry such as mathematics and physics, and in the confrontation of human beings with the enigmas of their experience in the context of religion. In each of these settings, Unger argues, we are not “ever entirely hostage to the social and conceptual worlds that have helped shape us. They may direct us over much of our lives, but they do not own us.”

This view of human nature as irrepressibly context-transcending is at the heart of what Unger finds useful for the religion of the future in the doctrine of the struggle with the world, and it is this element of the doctrine that he embraces as the starting point for his vision of a religion of the future. But he finds that all of its contemporary forms, the tradition of struggling with the world is radically defective.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=121-195}}

===Nature of the religious revolution represented by the religion of the future===
Unger argues that a new religious revolution would be thoroughly naturalistic and would pursue the task of enhancing life now, rather than promising salvation or reward in the indefinite future. Such a revolution would likely contain elements that resemble past religious revolutions such as visionary teaching and exemplary action, but would combined with elements unknown to the religious revolutions of the past. The religious revolution that Unger envisions would have the following qualities:
* It would not centralize prophetic power in a single individual and his decisive action in history.
* It would be concerned both with reshaping society as well as reorienting individual life.
* It would include a vision for the cumulative transformation of society that would not be reducible to a definite blueprint or formula.
* It would seek to remedy our condition of estrangement from the present moment, recognizing that time is our most precious possession, and that religion must help us transform our lives now, if only in fragmentary and inchoate form, no matter what changes are sought in the structure of society in historical time.
* It would reject the taboo on the religious criticism of religion.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=194-289}}

===Unger's conception of "deep freedom" and the social and political changes that would help bring it about===
Unger sets forth the structural changes in society that would be necessary to foster the emancipatory conditions of the religion of the future, to make society more open to experiment, fulfillment, connection, and surprise. At the heart of his political proposals in this chapter is the general concept of “structure-revising structure,” and the various ways that this can be embodied in political and social institutions. Unger’s vision for politics in this chapter includes “heating up” the political process, creating institutional mechanisms for breaking impasse between branches of government, and increasing mass mobilization of citizens so that all have a voice in the direction and operation of government.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=290-340}}

===Quality of human life under the religion of the future===
Unger speculates on the quality that life would have under the regime instituted by a future religious revolution. Individuals would become freer to innovate, experiment, take risks, and look for trouble. Connections between people would be deeper and more meaningful. Social mechanisms and safety nets would be in place that would allow and encourage this climate of experiment, risk, cooperation and love.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=341-444}}

==Reception==
Reviewing ''The Religion of the Future'' in the ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'', Andrew B. Irvine wrote that “the book demands to be read not as a contribution to scholarly debate but as a direct intervention in the most important and urgent issues of today …  No review could cover all the angles from which this book deserves to be appreciated—and criticized.”{{sfn|Irvine|2015|p=554}} Irvine contends that Unger’s argument  “dramatically ...simplifies the indefinitely complex data of religion, but it does so in the name of a single religious perspective.”{{sfn|Irvine|2015|p=567}} Irvine asks: “What would this book look like if it were more deeply comparative and/or interreligious in its thinking? It is comparative and interreligious, of course, but Unger’s exclusivistic affirmation of the ‘struggle with the world’ seems insufficiently informed.”{{sfn|Irvine|2015|p=567}} Irvine concludes his review by applauding ''The Religion of the Future'', stating that it “merits reading by philosophers, theologians, and activists, especially any who hold that a naturalistic metaphysics and praxis are vital to a flourishing human future. Its weaknesses are as instructive as its strengths.”{{sfn|Irvine|2015|p=568}}

Bonaventure Chapman, writing in the Catholic publication ''Dominicana'', described ''The Religion of the Future'' as “a prophetic vision of any future religion,”{{sfn|Chapman|2014|p=11}} and stated that he considered the book, alongside [[Ronald Dworkin]]’s ''Religion Without God'', to be an example of “religious atheism,” that is, a “new attitude to God” that “presents a new horizon for Christianity.”{{sfn|Chapman|2014|p=22}} While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a “maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness.”{{sfn|Chapman|2014|p=22}}

Reviewing ''The Religion of the Future'' in ''[[Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews]]'', Jeremy David Bendik-Keymer considered the book as the second part of the project that Unger began in ''[[The Self Awakened: Pragmatism Unbound]]'' and concluded in ''[[The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time]]''. Bendik-Keymer summarizes Unger’s project in these works as one that “seeks a world in which we live in the present, free of repression of, or reactive attitudes towards, the existential limitations of being human and in which we act collectively to create the conditions for ongoing innovation and self-transformation” (internal citations omitted). Bendik-Keymer complains that Unger’s depiction of human beings is “belittling” and concludes that Unger “has simply missed the mark… Unger may think of his work as preparation for prophesy, but it ends up as pontification.”{{sfn|Bendik-Keymer|2014}}

==Quotes==

- p.236

{{quote|The category of religion lacks any permanent core. There is no set way in which the aspects of our experience that we designate as religious relate to other aspects. That the category of religion is historical, however, does not mean that it is empty of content. Its powers of discrimination are those that the history of mankind gives it. Each major change in the content of religion inspires a change in our idea of what the term most usefully designates.}}

- p.314

{{quote|Deep freedom is therefore freedom, grasped and realized through change of institutions and practices: not just through a one-time change but through a practice that can generate future, ongoing change in the institutional order of society. Deep freedom is thus also freedom as understood within the bounds of what I earlier described as the conception of a free society. The idea of deep freedom develops through an interplay between the conception of a free society and the institutional arrangements required to make that conception real. The conception informs the making of the institutional alternatives. The making of the alternative prompts us to enrich and revise the conception.}}

- p.349

{{quote|Our comprehensive conceptions of our identity, viewed in relation to our place in nature, are not, in this account, to be understood as merely or chiefly conjectures about a natural phenomenon, as if human nature were a thing. They do not resemble the thinking that produced the standard model of particle physics or the periodic table. They are prophecies, indeed imperfectly self-fulfilling prophecies, as I have argued in my defense of the concept of religion.}}

'''Time Matters''' is [[Law practice management software|practice management software]], produced by [[LexisNexis]] which was purchased by [[Reed Elsevier]] in March, 2004. It differs from [[contact management software]] such as [[ACT!]] or GoldMine because in addition to contacts, it manages calendaring, email, documents, research, billing, accounting, and matters or projects.&lt;ref name="LAT Article"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legalassistanttoday.com/reviews/2008/mj08_TimeMatters.htm | title=Time Matters 9.0 - Legal Series | author=Kim Plonsky |date=May 2008 | work=Legal Assistant Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CPATA Article"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cpatechnologyadvisor.com/web/online/Practice-Management/LexisNexis---Time-Matters/43$2375 | title=LexisNexis - Time Matters | author=Cygnus Business Media  |date=June 2009 | work=CPA Technology Advisor}}&lt;/ref&gt; It integrates with a variety of other software products from both [[LexisNexis]] and other vendors. Some of these vendors are Quicken, Microsoft, Palm, Mozilla, Corel, and Adobe.&lt;ref name="PM Face-Off"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://practicepro.ca/PracticeManagementSoftwareFace-offAndersonBilinskyPinnington.pdf | author=Anderson, W., Pinnington, D., Thornwell, N. | title=Practice Management Face-Off | year=2005 | work=practicePRO | pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed originally for law firms, Time Matters competes with Gavel, Amicus, Tabs, and other legal practice management products. It also may be used in conjunction with [[Document modelling]] and [[Document automation|Document assembly]] software products like [[HotDocs]] and Deal Builder.

Time Matters was developed by DATA.TXT Corporation originally of Coral Gables, Florida, later of Cary, North Carolina (Cary is part of the Research Triangle Area of Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill... the "Silicon Valley of the East").  Since its inception, DATA.TXT Corporation focused on making Time Matters an all-encompassing professional office software package, providing Calendar, Tickler, Contact, Matter, Document, and Messaging Management for personal computers and networks of all sizes. Founded in December 1989 by Robert Butler who was later joined as co-founder by Kevin Stilwell in 1992, the entire management and programming staff that began Time Matters' development in 1989 remained on the team until 2004, providing continuity and reliability rarely seen in software developed for specialized markets.

Time Matters became the number one seller of this type of Windows legal software, with nearly 60,000 users of the Windows version in all 50 US States, plus additional users in Canada, Europe, the Caribbean, Australia and New Zealand, Africa, and Southeast Asia.

Time Matters for Windows has been shipping since 1994 (The DOS version of Time Matters started shipping in 1989).&lt;ref name="http://www.timematters.com/"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://timematters.com/about1.htm | author=DATA.TXT Corporation | title=Time Matters - About Us | year=2000 | work=Time Matters website | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000824164816/http://timematters.com/about1.htm | archivedate=August 24, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Time Matters was previously available in three editions: Professional, Enterprise, and World. The Enterprise edition used [[Microsoft SQL Server]] as its database engine. Time Matters Browser Edition (formerly World Edition) served up Time Matters in Web browsers for remote access to a law firm's data. An international network of Certified Independent Consultants ("CICs") support, train, and customize this product for end users.

Time Matters Professional, discontinued with the release of Time Matters 10.0 in 2009, was based on the TPS file system developed by Softvelocity.  Time Matters Enterprise, now simply Time Matters, is based on SQL for its database and currently is limited to Microsoft SQL Server and [[SQL Server Express|SQL Express]] (also from Microsoft). None of the open-source SQL programs such as Postgresql and MySQL are currently supported.

With the release of Version 10 in October 2009, Time Matters became available only in the Enterprise Edition (but is sold as Time Matters). In May 2010, LexisNexis released their new Annual Maintenance Plan policy, which required users to be on the Annual Maintenance Plan to receive technical support, product upgrades and access to online training and support resources.

It should be noted that LexisNexis now requires users to purchase an annual maintenance and support contract in order to receive technical support. This support does also include recovery and reinstallation of a Time Matters server. No per incidence technical support options are available.

The treaty was named after a village in northern [[Macau]] where the temple is located, called Mong Ha or Wang Hia ({{zh|first=t|t=[[:zh:望廈村|望廈]]|s=望厦|p=Wàngxià|cy=Mohng Hah}}).&lt;ref name="cassel-grounds"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cassel|first1=Pär|title=Grounds of Judgment|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-979205-4|page=53|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now a part of the territory's [[Nossa Senhora de Fátima, Macau|Our Lady of Fátima Parish]].

==Treaty contents==
The United States was represented by [[Caleb Cushing]], a [[Massachusetts]] lawyer dispatched by President [[John Tyler]] under pressure from American merchants concerned about the British dominance in Chinese trade.&lt;ref name="cassel-grounds" /&gt; A physician and missionary, [[Peter Parker (physician)|Peter Parker]], served as Cushing's [[Chinese language|Chinese]] interpreter. The [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] was represented by [[Keying (official)|Keying]], the [[Viceroy of Liangguang]], who held responsibility for the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi.

The treaty was modeled after the Treaties of [[Treaty of Nanking|Nanking]] and the [[Treaty of the Bogue|Bogue]] between the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and China, but differed in being more detailed.&lt;ref name="cassel-grounds" /&gt; Among other things, it contained provisions for:

* [[Extraterritoriality]], where Chinese subjects would be tried and punished under Chinese law and American citizens would be tried and punished under the authority of the American consul or other public functionaries authorised to that effect&lt;ref name="cassel-grounds" /&gt;
* Fixed tariffs on trade in the treaty ports
* The right to buy land in the five [[treaty ports]] and erect churches and hospitals there
* The right to [[Chinese language#Learning Chinese|learn Chinese]] by abolishing a law which thitherto forbade foreigners to do so&lt;ref&gt;Article 18 of the treaty states, "It shall be lawful for the officers or citizens of the United States to employ scholars and peoples of any part of China…to teach any of the languages of the Empire, and to assist in literary labors ... it shall in like manner be lawful for citizens of the United States to purchase all manner of books in China."&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The U.S. received [[most favoured nation]] status, resulting in the U.S. receiving the same beneficial treatment China gave to other powers such as [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and received the right to modify the treaty after 12 years

The United States also granted the Qing empire powers to confiscate American ships if operating outside treaty ports and withdrew consular protection in cases where American citizens were trading in opium under articles 3 and 33, respectively.&lt;ref name="cassel-grounds" /&gt; Furthermore, the U.S. agreed to hand over any [[Illegal drug trade#Opium|offenders]] to China.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15826">The '''Valech Report''' (officially '''The National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture Report''') was a record of abuses committed in [[Chile]] between 1973 and 1990 by agents of [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s military regime. The report was published on November 29, 2004 and detailed the results of a six-month investigation. A revised version was released on June 1, 2005. The commission was reopened in February 2010 for eighteen months, adding more cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radio.uchile.cl/noticias/59143/ |title=Reabren Comisión Valech « Radio Universidad de Chile – Diario Electrónico |publisher=Radio.uchile.cl |date= |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission found that 38,254 people had been imprisoned for political reasons and that most had been tortured. It also found that thirty people "disappeared" or had been executed in addition to those recorded by the earlier [[Rettig Report]].

Testimony has been classified, and will be kept secret for the next fifty years. Therefore, the records cannot be used in trials concerning human rights violations, in contrast to the "[[Archives of Terror]]" in [[Paraguay]] and [[Operation Condor]]. Associations of ex-political prisoners have been denied access to the testimony.

==Commission==

The report was prepared at the request of President [[Ricardo Lagos]] by the eight-member National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture headed by [[Bishop]] [[Sergio Valech]] and was made public via the [[Internet]]. The commission included: María Luisa Sepúlveda (executive vice president), lawyers Miguel Luis Amunátegui, Luciano Fouillioux, [[José Antonio Gómez]] ([[Social Democrat Radical Party|PRSD]] president), Lucas Sierra, Álvaro Varela and psychologist Elizabeth Lira. It did not include any representative of the victims or members of the associations of ex-political prisoners.

==Findings==

===First part===
The initial report was based on testimony given to the commission by 35,865 people, of which 27,255 were regarded as "direct victims". Of these, 94% said they were tortured. Eleven people were born in prison, and ninety-one underage children were detained with their parents (including four unborn babies); these were not considered "direct victims". Another group of 978 people were minors at the time of their arrest. Four women were pregnant at the time of their arrest and were tortured; their children were considered "direct victims". A child who was the result of a rape while in prison was also considered a "direct victim". Victims were detained for six months, on average.

Out of the more than 8,600 rejected cases, 7,290 people requested that their cases be revised. The commission also agreed to investigate a further 166 cases which were not considered the first time around. The updated report added 1,204 new cases, bringing the total number of victims to 28,459. The total number of arrests was 34,690; some people were detained multiple times.

The commission found that approximately 69% of arrests occurred between September 11 and December 31 of 1973, and 19% between January 1973 and August 1977.

===Second part===
Under the presidency of [[Michelle Bachelet]] the commission was reopened. It reviewed about 32,000 new requests from February 2010 to August 2011. It was to be open for twelve months but due to the high number of requests it was extended for an additional six months. 9,795 cases of torture and thirty cases of disappearances or executions were certified.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comisionvalech.gov.cl/InformeComision/NominaPPT2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comisionvalech.gov.cl/InformeComision/NominaDDE2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The new report was presented to President [[Sebastián Piñera]] on August 18, 2011 and released on August 26, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2011/08/674-387056-9-mandatario-recibio-en-la-moneda-el-segundo-informe-de-la-comision-valech.shtml |title=Mandatario recibió en La Moneda el segundo informe de la Comisión Valech &amp;#124; Política |publisher=La Tercera |date=2011-08-03 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
The state provided lifelong monetary compensation to the victims as well as health and education benefits. These are detailed in Law 19,992 and include: a monthly payment of about 113,000 to 129,000 thousand [[Chilean peso]]s (in December 2004 prices, subsequently adjusted for inflation), depending on the victim's age; free public healthcare for victims and their parents, spouses or children under twenty-five, or incapacitated children of any age; free education (primary to tertiary) for victims whose studies were interrupted by their imprisonment.&lt;ref name="leyvalech"&gt;[http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idLey=19992 Ley 19,992], Chile's Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a special bonus of four million Chilean pesos for victim's children who were born in captivity or who were detained with their parents while they were minors.&lt;ref name="leyvalech"/&gt;

==Criticism==
{{POV section|date=September 2014}}
Critics of the Valech Report said that families were falsely claiming that their relatives went missing during the 1973–1990 military regime, as there had been reports since 2000 that four people, listed as killed or missing, were alive or had died in unrelated circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impunity Watch: South America 2008|url=http://www.impunitywatch.com/impunity_watch_south_amer/2008/12/index.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jCtEya0B?url=http://www.impunitywatch.com/impunity_watch_south_amer/2008/12/index.html|archivedate=22 August 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=16 August 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cases have raised questions about the system of verification of victims of dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chilean government to sue disappeared tricksters|work=Albuquerque Express|date=30 December 2008|url=http://story.albuquerqueexpress.com/index.php/ct/9/cid/c08dd24cec417021/id/447655/cs/1/|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jCtFawtP?url=http://story.albuquerqueexpress.com/index.php/ct/9/cid/c08dd24cec417021/id/447655/cs/1/|archivedate=22 August 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=16 August 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Age'' newspaper has reported that a total of 1,183 people were killed, or reported missing and presumed dead, and that their names appear on a special memorial at the General Cemetery of Santiago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Age|date=30 December 2008|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/human-rights/false-reports.htm|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jCtFyff6?url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/human-rights/false-reports.htm|archivedate=22 August 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=16 August 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clive Foss, in ''The Tyrants: 2500 years of Absolute Power and Corruption'', estimates that 1,500 Chileans were killed or disappeared during the Pinochet regime. Nearly 700 civilians disappeared during the period between 1974  and 1977 after being detained by the Chilean military and police.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/13/world/new-chilean-leader-announces-political-pardons.html "New Chilean Leader Announces Political Pardons"], ''New York Times'', 13 March 1990&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1979, ''The New York Times'' reported that [[Amnesty International]] had documented the disappearance of approximately 1,500 Chileans since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;"A Green Light for The Junta?", ''New York Times'', 28 October 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the associations of ex-political prisoners, the commission used a different definition of torture than the one accepted by the [[United Nations]]. Using UN's definition of torture, would have meant there were about 400,000 victims of torture, but there is no clear source on how this estimate was made.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}) Most of those new cases of child victims had not been included in the first report because their parents were either [[Execution (legal)|executed]] political prisoners or among the "[[forced disappearance|disappeared]]" detainees and there were no confirming witnesses. About two-thirds of the cases of abuse that were recognized by the commission took place during 1973.

The associations say that testimony was accepted under the following conditions:

Detention had to have been for more than five days. (In 1986, in Santiago de Chile, 120,000 people were detained by the armed forces. Of those, 24,000 were detained by ''Carabineros'' (the Chilean police force) for a duration of four and a half days.) However, the Commission's requirement was not about the length of detention,the  but about the political motivation for the detention or torture. In those cases where evidence of either was found, even if the period of detention was of few days, the testimony of those individuals was accepted (see article 1, paragraph 2 of Supreme Decree 1,040 of 2003, that created the Commission and established its mandate &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comisiontortura.cl/filesapp/DecretoSupremo1040.pdf |title=Comisión Asesora para la calificación de Detenidos Desaparecidos, Ejecutados Políticos y Víctimas de Prisión Política y Tortura |publisher=Comisiontortura.cl |date= |accessdate=2011-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815232220/http://www.comisiontortura.cl/filesapp/DecretoSupremo1040.pdf |archive-date=2009-08-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Detention must have been in one of the 1,200 official detention or torture centers listed by the Commission including: [[Villa Grimaldi]], [[Colonia Dignidad]], [[Víctor Jara]] Stadium or the [[Esmeralda (BE-43)|Esmeralda]] floating center. Cases of torture in the streets or in vehicles were excluded. (Starting in the 1980s, the CNI, which succeeded [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]], no longer took victims to detention centers thus, say the associations, the fact that about two-thirds of the cases of abuse that were approved by the commission took place during 1973). The case of [[Carmen Gloria Quintana]], who was burnt alive in the middle of the 1980s, was not recognized, following this definition of torture. This allegation is erroneous.  There was no official list of detention centers where victims had to have been detained for their cases to be recognized. The list established by the Commission was the product of the testimony received despite the fact that previous lists of detention centers included most places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.memoriaviva.com/ | title=Memoria Viva | publisher=Proyecto Internacional de Derechos Humanos | accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty in accepting testimony from people detained in vehicles or tortured on the street was in finding enough evidence to support their cases. Those cases where evidence was found of people being detained and tortured in police buses or other vehicles were accepted. Ms. Quintana contacted the Commission but did not testify before it.

Detention must not have taken place in any country other than Chile. The associations underlined the fact that the commission worked for only six months, with very little publicity, despite the UN's demand that it accept testimony for a longer period. In some cases, in rural areas, victims who knew about the Commission had to give testimony to local civil servants who were part of the local governments when they were detained and tortured. When the Commission knew about this situation, it demanded the exclusion of those officers from the process and sent new teams to those areas. The Commission coordinated its work with all regional and national organizations of former political prisoners, and human rights organizations, to help contact their members, and others to give testimony. Advertisements were broadcast on national and local radio and television stations and published in national and local newspapers. (Commission's report pages 48 to 51, at www.comisiontortura.cl/filesapp/03_cap_ii.pdf) The number of individuals testifying is consistent with the geographic distribution of inhabitants in the capital city and the provinces. (Commission's report pages 69 and 70, at www.comisiontortura.cl/filesapp/03_cap_ii.pdf).  The commission worked only during office hours, forcing victims to ask their employer for permission to testify. Insufficient psychological assistance was provided to the victims who had to relive their experiences, some of them suffering flashbacks, except referring statement givers to the Comprehensive Health Care Reparations Program (PRAIS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fonasa.cl/prontus_fonasa/antialone.html?page=http://www.fonasa.cl/prontus_fonasa/site/artic/20041220/pags/20041220002047.html |title=FONASA |publisher=Fonasa.cl |date= |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some specialized mental health care NGOs were unable to meet the demand thus "[[re-victimization|re-victimizing]]" those individuals. Ex-political prisoners said that testimony from minors under eighteen years of age was refused because it was impossible for them to recall exactly the details of the place and time where they had been tortured. (Children, some of them five years old, and adolescents, had been tortured by the dictatorship).

Sixty percent of the ex-political prisoners were unemployed for at least two years according to studies made by ex-political prisoners' associations. Their life expectancy is only sixty to sixty-five years. Switzerland and Argentina have recently refused to extradite two ex-political prisoner to Chile, on the grounds that they might be subject to "mistreatment" in Chile.

==Judgment==
Until May 2012, seventy-six agents had been condemned for human rights violations and sixty-seven were convicted: thirty-six from the [[Chilean Army|Army]], twenty-seven [[Carabineros de Chile|Carabineros]], two from the [[Chilean Air Force|Air Force]], one from the [[Chilean Navy|Navy]], and one of the [[Investigations Police of Chile|PDI]]. Three condemned agents died and six agents got conditional sentences. The Chilean justice system holds 350 open cases of "disappeared" persons, illegal detainees, and torture victims during the dictatorial rule. These cases involve 700 military and civilian personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://www.latercera.com/noticia/nacional/2012/06/680-465560-9-estudio-revela-que-76-son-los-agentes-de-la-dictadura-condenados-por-violaciones.shtml Estudio revela que 76 son los agentes de la dictadura condenados por violaciones a DDHH] in the Chilean newspaper [[La Tercera]] on 09 Juli 2012,  retrieved on 22 juli 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Warrantless searches''' are [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]] conducted without [[search warrant]]s.

In the United States, warrantless searches are restricted under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]], part of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], which provides that, "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon [[probable cause]], supported by [[oath]] or [[Affirmation in law|affirmation]], and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."

==History==
In the [[Thirteen Colonies]], agents of the [[British Empire]] utilized [[general warrant]]s to authorize searches in the homes of colonists –  such warrants allowed any place to be searched for any thing at any time, all at the whim of the holder. They were viewed as abuses of power, contributing to increased tensions that ultimately led to the [[American Revolution]]. The Fourth Amendment barred all warrantless searches and all general warrants; nevertheless, the interpretation and limitations of the Fourth Amendment and the permissibility of warrantless searches under certain circumstances (such as wartime) have been important in the history of executive and [[Judiciary|judicial]] power in the United States.

During the [[American Revolutionary War]], "the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] regularly received quantities of intercepted [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tory]] mail".&lt;ref&gt;"Intelligence Techniques." ''Intelligence in the War of Independence''. Central Intelligence Agency, 2007.

In 1975, the [[Church Committee]], a [[United States Senate]] [[Select or special committee (United States)|select committee]] chaired by [[Frank Church]] of [[Idaho]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], investigated domestic and foreign [[Cold War]] area intelligence-gathering by the [[United States federal government|federal government]], including warrantless surveillance on anti-war advocates inside America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Warrantless FBI Electronic Surveillance |url=http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/book3/html/ChurchB3_0139a.htm |website=AARC |publisher=Assassination Archives and Research Center |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee report found the "Americans who violated no criminal law and represented no genuine threat to the '[[national security]]' have been targeted, regardless of the stated predicate. In many cases, the implementation of [[Telephone tapping|wiretaps]] and [[Covert listening device|bugs]] has also been fraught with procedural violations, even when the required procedures were meager, thus compounding the abuse. The inherently intrusive nature of electronic surveillance, moreover, has enabled the Government to generate vast amounts of information – unrelated to any legitimate governmental interest – about the personal and political lives of American citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Paul Wolf Archive |work=Church Committee: NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY SURVEILLANCE AFFECTING AMERICANS |url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIIj.htm |accessdate=February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "potential criminal liability of the [[National Security Agency]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] for operations such as [[Project Shamrock|SHAMROCK]] (interception of all international cable traffic from 1945 to 1975) and [[Project MINARET|MINARET]] (use of watchlists of U.S. dissidents and potential civil disturbers to provide intercept information to law enforcement agencies from 1969 to 1973)" helped persuade president [[Gerald Ford]] in 1976 to seek surveillance legislation, which was ultimately enacted as [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |title=National Security Archive at George Washington University |work=Wiretap Debate Déjà Vu |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB178/index.htm |accessdate=February 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 1985 report "Electronic Surveillance and Civil Liberties", the nonpartisan Congressional [[Office of Technology Assessment]] suggested legislation be considered for a surveillance oversight board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Security Archive |work=Electronic Surveillance and Civil Liberties |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB178/surv12.pdf |accessdate=February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress disbanded this agency in 1995.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Clinton administration===
On July 14, 1994, President Clinton's Deputy Attorney General and later [[National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|9/11 Commission]] member [[Jamie Gorelick]] testified to the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Intelligence Committee]] that "The Department of Justice believes, and the case law supports, that the president has inherent authority to conduct warrantless physical searches for foreign intelligence purposes … and that the president may, as has been done, delegate this authority to the Attorney General." This "inherent authority" was used to search the home of CIA spy [[Aldrich Ames]] without a warrant. "It is important to understand", Gorelick continued, "that the rules and methodology for criminal searches are inconsistent with the collection of foreign intelligence and would unduly frustrate the president in carrying out his foreign intelligence responsibilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Byron |last=York |title=Clinton Claimed Authority to Order No-Warrant Searches – Does anyone remember that? |date=December 20, 2005 |publisher=National Review Online |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/york/york200512200946.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush|Bush]] secretly authorized the [[National Security Agency]] to eavesdrop on Americans and others inside the United States to search for evidence of terrorist activity without the court-approved warrants ordinarily required for domestic spying", as part of the [[War on Terrorism]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=James Risen |first=Eric Lichtblau |title=Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts |date=December 16, 2005 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|Under a presidential order signed in 2002, the intelligence agency monitored the international telephone calls and international e-mail messages of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people inside the United States without warrants over the past three years in an effort to track possible "dirty numbers" linked to Al Qaeda, the officials said. The agency, they said, still seeks warrants to monitor entirely domestic communications.}}

The revelation of this program caused a widespread controversy, with legal experts and politicians{{who|date=June 2013}} concluding that it violates the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] and other legal experts{{who|date=June 2013}} saying that the FISA law only applied to domestic calls and not to overseas calls and communications that involved a foreign intelligence threat. Bush administration officials such as the Attorney General defended the program by citing that this was a part of the justification that the Clinton administration used in its warrantless search of [[Aldrich Ames]]. They claimed that since Ames was spying for a foreign power, presidential power applied and FISA did not.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gov/ag/speeches/2006/ag_speech_060206.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====NSA call database====
{{main|NSA call database}}

In May 2006, it was revealed that the Bush administration had also been compiling a [[database]] of telephone calls, created by the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) with the cooperation of three of the largest telephone carriers in the United States: [[AT&amp;T]], [[Verizon]], and [[BellSouth]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-05-10-nsa_x.htm NSA has massive database of Americans' phone calls]'' – [[USA Today]], May 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; All three companies were paid to provide the information to the NSA.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12779087/site/newsweek/page/2/ Hold the Phone]'' – [[Newsweek]], May 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated that the database contains over 1.9 [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] [[call detail record|call-detail record]]s of phone calls made after September 11, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/11/AR2006051100539.html Data on Phone Calls Monitored]'' – [[Washington Post]], May 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The database's existence prompted fierce objection from those who viewed it as a warrantless or illegal search – nevertheless, the collection of such third-party information has been authorized by the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], and has been upheld by the courts.

=====United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review=====

In a 2002 opinion entitled ''[[In re: Sealed Case No. 02-001]]'', the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review]] examined all the significant appellate decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=In re: Sealed Case No. 02-001 |vol=310 |reporter=[[Federal Reporter|F.3d]] |opinion=717 |pinpoint= |court=[[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review]] |date=2002 |url=http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/terrorism/fisa111802opn.pdf |accessdate=12 June 2013 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court noted all the Federal courts of appeal having looked at the issue had concluded that there was such constitutional power. Furthermore, if there was such power, "FISA could not encroach on the president's constitutional power", However, In Re Sealed Case "[took] for granted" that these cases are correct:

{{quote|The Truong court, as did all the other courts to have decided the issue, held that the President did have inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches to obtain foreign intelligence information. It was incumbent upon the court, therefore, to determine the boundaries of that constitutional authority in the case before it. We take for granted that the President does have that authority and, assuming that is so, FISA could not encroach on the President's constitutional power ...

... Even without taking into account the President's inherent constitutional authority to conduct warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance, we think the procedures and government showings required under FISA, if they do not meet the minimum Fourth Amendment warrant standards, certainly come close. We, therefore, believe firmly, applying the balancing test drawn from ''Keith'', that FISA as amended is constitutional because the surveillances it authorizes are reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa/fiscr111802.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The "balancing test drawn from ''Keith''" is a reference to ''[[United States v. U.S. District Court]]'', in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] established a legal test to determine whether the primary use of the warrantless search was to collect foreign intelligence, as per presidential authority, or whether that primary use is to gather evidence for use in a criminal trial.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. U.S. District Court]] (Keith)'', {{ussc|407|297|1972|pin=322}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exceptions to the search warrant requirement==

The warrant requirement of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] is not absolute, and a number of exceptions to that requirement have been recognized by the courts, based upon such factors as whether it is reasonable under the circumstances for officers to obtain a warrant, and whether evidence might be lost or destroyed before a warrant can be obtained.&lt;ref name="elwarrant"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What Are Your Fourth Amendment Rights|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/fires/fourth_amendment.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=20 July 2017|date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
