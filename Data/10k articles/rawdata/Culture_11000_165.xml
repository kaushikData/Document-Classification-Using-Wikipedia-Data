'''Ancient Egyptian pottery''' includes all objects of fired [[clay]] from [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothea Arnold]] excludes figural objects - "Keramik,"  Wolfgang Helck, Wolfhart Westendorf: ''Lexikon der Ägyptologie.'' Vol. III, Wiesbaden 1980, col. 392&lt;/ref&gt; First and foremost, [[ceramic]]s served as household wares for the storage, preparation, transport, and consumption of food, drink, and raw materials. Such items include beer and wine mugs and water jugs, but also bread molds, fire pits, lamps, and stands for holding round vessels, which were all commonly used in the Egyptian household. Other types of [[pottery]] served ritual purposes. Ceramics are often found as [[grave goods]].

Specialists in ancient Egyptian pottery draw a fundamental distinction between ceramics made of [[Nile]] clay and those made of [[marl]] clay, based on [[chemistry|chemical]] and [[mineralogical]] composition and ceramic properties. Nile clay is the result of [[erosion|eroded]] material in the [[Ethiopia]]n mountains, which was transported into Egypt by the Nile. This clay has deposited on the banks of the Nile in Egypt since the [[Late Pleistocene]] by the [[inundation]]. Marl clay is a yellow-white stone which occurs in [[limestone]] deposits. These deposits were created in the [[Pleistocene]], when the primordial waters of the Nile and its tributaries brought sediment into Egypt and deposited in on what was then the desert edge.

Our understanding of the nature and organisation of ancient Egyptian pottery manufacture is based on tomb paintings, models, and archaeological remains of pottery workshops. A characteristic of the development of Egyptian ceramics is that the new methods of production which were developed over time never entirely replaced older methods, but expanded the repertoire instead, so that eventually, each group of objects had its own manufacturing technique. Egyptian potters employed a wide variety of decoration techniques and motifs, most of which are associated with specific periods of time, such as the creation of unusual shapes, decoration with incisions, various different firing processes, and painting techniques.

An important [[classification]] system for Egyptian pottery is the ''Vienna system'', which was developed by [[Dorothea Arnold]], [[Manfred Bietak]], [[Janine Bourriau]], [[Helen Jacquet|Helen]] and [[Jean Jacquet]], and [[Hans-Åke Nordström]] at a meeting in [[Vienna]] in 1980.

[[Seriation (archaeology)|Seriation]] of Egyptian pottery has proven useful for the [[Egyptian chronology#Synchronisms|relative chronology]] of ancient Egypt. This method was invented by [[Flinders Petrie]] in 1899. It is based on the changes of vessel types and the proliferation and decline of different types over time.

== Material ==
Understanding of the raw material is essential for understanding the development, production, and typology of Egyptian ceramics. In Egyptian archaeology the distinction between Nile clay and marl clay is fundamental. Mixtures of the two types of clay can be seen as a third group.&lt;ref name="ArnoldLAe394"&gt;D. Arnold: "Keramik", ''LÄ III'', col. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nile clay===
[[File:RPM Ägypten 127.jpg|thumb|Glazed vessel made from Nile clay, with white painted details (''White Cross-lined'' style)]]
Nile clay is the result of [[erosion|eroded]] material in the [[Ethiopia]]n mountains, which was transported into Egypt by the Nile. This clay has deposited on the banks of the Nile in Egypt since the [[Late Pleistocene]] by the [[inundation]]. As a result, deposits can be found far from the modern floodplain as well as within the level covered by the flood in modern times. Chemically, the clay is characterised by high [[silicum]] content and a high level of [[Iron oxide]]. Mineralogically, it is [[mica]]caeous, [[illite]]-rich sediment clay, containing many different sand and stone particles brought from the various contexts through which the Nile flows.&lt;ref name="ArnoldLAe394" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Regner: ''Keramik'' (= ''Bonner Sammlung von Aegyptiaca.'' Vol. 3). Wiesbaden 1998, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The clay turns a red or brown colour when it is [[fire]]d in an oxygen-rich oven. When unfired, it varies in colour from grey to nearly black.&lt;ref name="AET121"&gt;Janine D. Bourriau, Paul T. Nicholson, Pamela J. Rose: "Pottery." Paul T. Nicholson, Ian Shaw (ed.): ''Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology.'' [[Cambridge]] 2000, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marl clay===
[[File:Cylinder vessel of King Hor Aha from Saqqara, 1st dynasty - Kestner-Museum, Hannover.jpg|thumb|vertical|Cylinder vessel made from marl clay, from the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|1st dynasty]]]]
The marl clay (or 'desert clay') is found along the Nile valley, from [[Esna]] to [[Cairo]], in the [[Oases]] and at the edges of the [[Nile Delta]]. It is a yellow-white stone, which is found in limestone deposits. The deposits were created in the Pleistocene, when the original Nile river and its tributaries deposited this clay in what had previously been desert.&lt;ref&gt;C. Regner: ''Keramik'' (= ''Bonner Sammlung von Aegyptiaca.'' Vol. 3). Wiesbaden 1998, pp. 10 f.&lt;/ref&gt; Marl clay includes a range of kinds of clay based on their base substance. In general, they have a lower percentage of silicum and significantly higher [[calcium]] content.&lt;ref name="ArnoldLAe395"&gt;D. Arnold: "Keramik." ''LÄ III'', col. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; The most important sub-types of marl clay are:&lt;ref name="AET121" /&gt;

* Qena clay: secondary deposits like that at Wadi [[Qena]]. This clay comes from sediments which were washed down the [[wadi]] and mixed with local [[slate]] and limestone.
* Marl clay from slate and limestone which is found along the Nile between Esna and Cairo.

Marl clay is normally cream or white in colour when it is fired in an oxygen-rich oven. Cuts can reveal pink or orange areas. It is rich in mineral salts, so the outer surface often has a thin layer of weathered [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] which forms a white surface layer when fired, which can be mistake for a 'glaze' by the unwary. At higher firing temperature (c. 1000&amp;nbsp;°C), this layer becomes olive-green and resembles a green glaze.&lt;ref name="AET122"&gt;Janine D. Bourriau, Paul T. Nicholson, Pamela J. Rose, "Pottery." Paul T. Nicholson, Ian Shaw (ed.): ''Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology.'' Cambridge 2000, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
[[File:Mastaba of Ti 05 b.jpg|thumb|Depiction of ceramic production in the [[Old Kingdom]] {{ill|Mastaba of Ti|de|Mastaba des Ti}}]]

=== Selection of material ===
The selection of material was based on local conditions and the function of the object being manufactured. Nile clay was principally used for household crockery and containers, as well as ceramics for ritual use. Marl clay was principally used for storage and prestige objects like figural vessels.&lt;ref name="ArnoldLAe399"&gt;D. Arnold: ''Keramik.'' In: ''LÄ III'', Sp. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gathering the clay ===
There is little precise information on how and where Egyptian potters got their raw material, how clay pits were run, how it was transported and how it was assigned to individual potters.&lt;ref name="ArnoldLAe399" /&gt; In general, it seems that the clay came from three different places: the shore of the Nile or irrigation canals, the desert near the fields, and the hills of the desert itself. A depiction in the tomb of [[Rekhmire]] ([[TT100]]) shows workers in the process of building up pile of Nile mud with hoes in order to make mudbricks. Clay for pottery production might have been gathered in a similar way. The scene also shows that Nile clay did not absolutely have to be taken from the fields. Piles of Nile clay were built up in the process of digging irrigation canals - as still happens today.&lt;ref&gt;D. Arnold, J. Bourriau: ''An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Pottery.'' Mainz 1993, pp. 11 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Preparation of the clay ===
[[File:Keramikherstellung-01.jpg|thumb|vertical|Working up the clay, in an image in a tomb in [[Beni Hasan]] from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (Tomb of Baket III.)]]
[[File:Keramikherstellung-02.jpg|thumb|Vertical|Kneading the clay, Beni Hasan (Tomb of Baket III)]]
Egyptian tomb paintings often show the preparation of the clay. There are also models which provide some other details. Clear archaeological remains of pottery workships, however, are rare. It is possible that they were very ephemeral structures.&lt;ref name="ArnoldLAe399" /&gt;

Clay which is exposed to air, dries very quickly. As a result, clay often reached the potter as dry, stony clumps (especially the marl clay from the desert) which first had to be cleaned and mixed with water in order to make it possible to shape it.&lt;ref&gt;D. Arnold, J. Bourriau: ''An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Pottery.'' Mainz 1993, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The raw clay was also dried and crushed in order to remove any large impurities, like stones, by passing it through a sieve. Another possibility was the [[elutriation]] of the clay by repeatedly immersing hard clay pellets in water and skimming the fine clay off the top. There is no evidence for such a process in the pottery workshop in [[Ayn Asil]] ([[Dachla]]),&lt;ref&gt;G. Soukiassian, M. Wuttmann, L. Pantalacci, P. Ballet, M. Picon: ''Balat III. Les Ateliers de Potiers d’Ayn-Asil.'' Kairo 1990, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is some possible evidence at [[Hieraconpolis]].&lt;ref&gt;R. O. Allen, H. Hamroush, M. A. Hoffman: ''Archaeological implications of differences in the composition of Nile sediments.'' (= ''Archaeological Chemistry.'' Bd. IV) Washington 1989, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; This elutriation would have to have been carried out in one or more pits or watering holes. Even before these finds, the depictions of potters in the tomb of [[Kenamun]] ([[TT93]]) had been interpreted as depicting elutriation in a watering hole. At least for the clay used in Meidum-ware in the Old Kingdom and the remarkably homogeneous Nile clay used from the beginning of the 18th dynasty, some kind of refining technology must have been used.&lt;ref&gt;D. Arnold, "Keramik." In: ''LÄ III'', col. 400; D. Arnold, J. Bourriau: ''An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Pottery.'' Mainz 1993, pp. 12 f.; Janine D. Bourriau, Paul T. Nicholson, Pamela J. Rose: "Pottery." in Paul T. Nicholson, Ian Shaw (ed.): ''Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology.'' Cambridge 2000, p. 122; E. Christiana Köhler: ''Buto III. Die Keramik von der späten Vorgeschichte bis zum frühen Alten Reich (Schicht III bis VI).'' Mainz 1998, p. 68; D. Arnold: ''Wandbild und Scherbenbefund. Zur Töpfereitechnik der alten Ägypter vom Beginn der pharaonischen Zeit bis zu den Hyksos.'' 1976, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard images show one or two men involved in preparing the clay, once they had softened it, by treading it with their feet in order to turn it into a malleable mass. At this stage, the clay might be supplemented with temper, if it was decided that it did not already contain sufficient fine impurities, like sand. It was important that these not be too big or sharp, "excessively large temper can make the walls of pottery vessels unstable, since the clay will not be able to mesh together properly. Sharp particles, like stones, could hurt the potter when kneading the clay and forming the vessels and prevent the creation of a smooth surface." Through the addition of balanced temper, the clay could be made "more malleable and stable during production, and also more porous, which made it easier to dry, bake, and use the finished vessel."&lt;ref&gt;C. Köhler: ''Buto III. Die Keramik von der späten Vorgeschichte bis zum frühen Alten Reich (Schicht III bis VI).'' Mainz 1998, p. 68. See also O. S. Rye, "Keeping your temper under control: materials and the manufacture of Papuan pottery." ''Archaeology and Physical Anthropology in Oceania.'' Vol. 2(2), 1976, pp. 106–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the clay had been mixed with water it would be full of air bubbles. To prevent cracking during the firing process, the clay had to be kneaded. In this process, two halves of a lump of clay were beaten against one another with significant force. In the tomb paintings, a worker in a bent position is shown working the clay with his hands before handing the kneaded balls directly over to the potter.&lt;ref&gt;D. Arnold, "Keramik." ''LÄ III'', col. 400; D. Arnold, J. Bourriau: ''An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Pottery.'' Mainz 1993, pp. 13 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shaping ===
There were five different techniques for shaping clay in ancient Egypt:&lt;ref name="Köhler69"/&gt;
* by hand
* using a rotatable pilaster
* using a [[potter's wheel]] operated by one of the potter's hands
* using a [[mould]]
* on a rapidly spinning potter's wheel, operated by an assistant or the potter's foot.

Characteristic of the development of ceramics is that, although new methods were developed over time, they never entirely replaced older ones. Rather, they expanded the repertoire, so that at the high point in the history of Egyptian pottery, each type of object had its own manufacturing technique.

==== Hand-shaping ====
[[File:PSM V55 D763 Woman of oraibi making coiled pottery.png|thumb|hochkant|[[Hopi]] woman making clay coil pottery (photo from 1899)]]
There were several different techniques for making pottery by hand: stacking a number of coils on a flat clay base, weaving, and free modelling. These three techniques were used from the [[predynastic]] period until at least the Old Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Köhler69"&gt;C. Köhler: ''Buto III. Die Keramik von der späten Vorgeschichte bis zum frühen Alten Reich (Schicht III bis VI).'' Mainz 1998, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free modelling by kneading and pulling at the clay with the hands is the oldest and most enduring technique for shaping clay. It was employed for all vessels in the [[Faiyum A culture]], in the [[Merimde culture]], and probably also in the [[Badari culture]]. In the Old Kingdom, it was used for the most important types and it was used for figures and models in all periods.&lt;ref name="ArnoldLAe405"/&gt; The resulting product had thick walls. The technique is recognisable by pressure marks where individual bits of clay have been pressed together.&lt;ref name="Köhler69" /&gt;

In the weaving technique, flat rectangular pieces of clay were woven together. The technique can be recognised by the fact that the broken vessels tend to form rectangular sherds. The technique seems to have come into widespread use in early Egypt, from the time when larger pottery vessels began to be made at the latest. Throughout the whole Pharaonic period and down to Roman times, large basins and tubs were made using this technique.&lt;ref name="ArnoldLAe399" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Köhler69" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Peterson, Bernd Pfannkuche, Alexandra Merz: ''Handwerk und Kunst der Keramik. Technik, Design, Materialien und Geschichte.'' Koönemann, Köln 1999, {{ISBN|978-3-8290-2140-1}}, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the clay coil method, a series of coils of clay were stacked one on top of the other to form the walls of a pot. This technique is seen in late predynastic pottery from [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]].&lt;ref name="ArnoldLAe399" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Köhler69" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Köhler69" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Peterson, B. Pfannkuche, A. Merz: ''Handwerk und Kunst der Keramik....'' Köln 1999, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rotating pilaster ====
[[File:Keramikherstellung-03.jpg|thumb|vertical|Creation of a vase using a rotating pedestal, from a depiction in the Mastaba of Ti]]
During the [[Chalcolithic]], the rotating pilaster came into use for the manufacture of ceramics. This may have arisen from the desire to make the body and especially the opening of the vessel being made symmetrical. The technique can be clearly recognised from a horizontal rotation mark in the opening of the cessel.&lt;ref name="Köhler69" /&gt; Unlike the potter's wheel, there was no fixed axis around which rotations were centred.&lt;ref&gt;D. Arnold, "Keramik." In ''LÄ III'', col. 403.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pilaster used in this technique could by a bowl, plate, basket, mat, textile, or even a pottery sherd. This pilaster was rotated along with the vessel, as the potter shaped it. The rotation technique was used only for the creation of the vessel's shell. The earlier techniques were also used for other parts of the manufacturing process. Thus, on finished vessels, traces of free modelling are found, especially in the lower parts, but the edges were turned after the completion of the whole vessel.&lt;ref name="Köhler69" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ArnoldLAe399" /&gt;

==== Hand-operated potter's wheel ====
An important advance was the invention of the [[potter's wheel]], which rotated on a central axis. This enabled the potter to rotate the wheel and the vessel with one hand, while shaping the vessel with the other hand.&lt;ref name="Köhler70"&gt;C. Köhler: ''Buto III. Die Keramik von der späten Vorgeschichte bis zum frühen Alten Reich (Schicht III bis VI).'' Mainz 1998, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Dorothea Arnold]], the slow potter's wheel was invented some time during the [[Fourth dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Arnold: "Keramik," in ''LÄ III'', col. 403; Arnold: ''Wandbild und Scherbenbefund.'' p. 17; D. Arnold, J. Bourriau: ''An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Pottery.'' Mainz 1993, pp. 43 f.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eva Christiana Köhler]] has subsequently argued that this should be corrected to a substantially earlier period, "the invention of the potter's wheel is a development which generally accompanied a certain form of mass-production. It enabled standardisation and the rapid production of finished vessels."&lt;ref name="Köhler70" /&gt; According to her, this development can clearly be traced back to the mass-produced conical bowls of the [[Mesopotamia]]n [[Uruk period|Uruk culture]] at [[Habuba Kabira]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Köhler: ''Buto III. Die Keramik von der späten Vorgeschichte bis zum frühen Alten Reich (Schicht III bis VI).'' Mainz 1998, p. 70 n. 390 with reference to D. A. Sürenhagen: ''Keramikproduktion in Ḥabūba Kabira.'' Hessling, Berlin 1978, pp. 89 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In production, first, a large clay cone was shaped on the disc. The peak of the cone was the actual point of rotation, around which the bowl was to be formed. It was then sliced off with a wire or a cord. The resulting bowls had a relatively thick wall near the base and marks from rotation and pulling on the underside of the base. Christiana Köhler detected such marks on vessels of the predynastic period, which makes it fairly likely that the slow potter's wheel was in use in this period.&lt;ref name="Köhler70" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Mold ====
It is assumed that baking pans for conical bread were made with the help of a mold. It is possible that they were shaped around a conical wooden core, which had the shape of the conical bread which would eventually be baked in the pans.&lt;ref name="Köhler70" /&gt;

==== Fast potter's wheel ====
[[File:Kenamun-Keramikproduktion.jpg|thumb|Depiction of ceramic production from the [[New Kingdom]] gave of Kenamun.]]
Manufacture on the fast potter's wheel, operated by an assistant or the foot of the potter was a relatively late development, which took place in the New Kingdom at the earliest. The earliest depiction comes from the Tomb of Kenamun from the middle of the [[Eighteenth dynasty]], in which an assistant grips the wheel and thereby helps the potter to use the wheel, while the potter himself uses his foot to stabilise it.&lt;ref&gt;D. Arnold, J. Bourriau: ''An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Pottery.'' Mainz 1993, pp. 75 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surface treatment ===
[[File:Keramikherstellung-04.jpg|thumb|vertical|Shaping the round base of a bowl in a depiction from Beni Hasan]]
[[File:Liberia - Pottery making.jpg|thumb|Scraping away excess clay on the base of a pottery vessel. Photo of ceramic production in [[Liberia]] in 1968.]]
The shaped vessel first had to be dried enough that the walls would be stable for further work. The clay was brought to roughly the consistency of leather, remaining damp enough that it could still be moulded and shaped. At this point paint, glaze and [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] could be added if desired. After further drying the vessel was polished.&lt;ref name="Köhler71"&gt;C. Köhler: ''Buto III. Die Keramik von der späten Vorgeschichte bis zum frühen Alten Reich (Schicht III bis VI).'' Mainz 1998, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; There were two techniques for polishing the vessel's surface:&lt;ref name="ArnoldLAe405"&gt;D. Arnold: "Keramik." In: ''LÄ III'', col. 401 f.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Polishing by rubbing without pressure produced a consistent, light sheen. Examples include Old Kingdom jugs, jugs and dishes from the [[First Intermediate period]] and possibly the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].
* Polishing with a burnish or significant pressure on the vessel's surface. This results in very shiny surfaces, but only in rare cases of especially careful work (such as Meidum bowls of the Old Kingdom) are no polishing marks left behind. In the [[Thinis]] period and the [[seventeenth dynasty|seventeenth]] and eighteenth dynasties, potters made decorative patterns with the marks left by this polishing process.

At this stage, impressions or incisions could also be made in the clay, "when the clay was still damp enough that it would not break in the process, but was dry enough that no raised areas would be left in the incisions." This was done with various tools, including bone or wooden nails, combs made from bone or shellfish, and [[flint]] knives.&lt;ref name="Köhler71" /&gt;

After an initial drying phase, the round base was finished. This was done by hand until the seventeenth dynasty, using a flat tool to cut and smooth the base. A foot was also cut by hand, or molded from an additional lump of clay. After the beginning of the seventeenth dynasty, the foot was instead made on the potter's wheel from the mass of clay used for the creation of the base of the vessel. At this point, bases and stands increasingly have rotation marks on the outside.&lt;ref&gt;D. Arnold, "Keramik," ''LÄ III'', col. 404 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drying===
In the drying process, the vessel had to be kept under controlled conditions, such that all parts of the vessel dried equally and no shrinking took place.&lt;ref&gt;D. Arnold, J. Bourriau: ''An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Pottery.'' Mainz 1993, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, a lot of water had to evaporate, since the remaining water would boil at the beginning of the firing process, "which led the water vapour to expand in volume, leading to explosions if it could not escape.&lt;ref&gt;C. Köhler: ''Buto III. Die Keramik von der späten Vorgeschichte bis zum frühen Alten Reich (Schicht III bis VI).'' Mainz 1998, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vessel was left to dry in direct sunlight when the light was weak, in the shade when it was strong, or in a closed room when it was raining or cold. The drying process could take several days, depending on the humidity, the size, wall-thickness, and porosity of the vessel. Even when drying was complete, vessels remained between 3-5% saturated with water, which was only expelled during the firing process.&lt;ref name="Köhler71" /&gt;

=== Firing ===
[[File:Kababougou.jpg|thumb|Firing pottery on an open fire in a village on the [[Niger]] in [[Mali]] (photo from 2009).]]
[[File:Aegypten-Toepferofen.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of a [[kiln]] in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], New Kingdom]]
In the [[firing]] process, the clay is transformed from a malleable material to a rigid one. Up to this point it is possible to make the clay malleable again by making it wet. After firing, damaged vessels, like misfirings, are nearly unfixable.&lt;ref name="MAT127"&gt;Janine D. Bourriau, Paul T. Nicholson, Pamela J. Rose: "Pottery." In: Paul T. Nicholson, Ian Shaw (ed.): ''Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology.'' Cambridge 2000, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for the transformation of the clay into this final and moisture-less form, it must be heated to a temperature of 550-600&amp;nbsp;°C. Before this, at around 100&amp;nbsp;°C, residual moisture escapes into the air and at 300&amp;nbsp;°C the chemically-bonded [[water of crystallization]] also escapes. The supply of [[oxygen]] during the firing process is critical, since it is used up as the fuel is burnt. If more is not supplied (e.g. through a vent), an atmosphere rich in [[carbon monoxide]] or free [[carbon]] will develop and it will create a black or brown-black [[Iron(II) oxide]], which gives the fired pottery a grey or dark brown colour. This is called a [[Reducing atmosphere|reducing]] firing. In an [[Redox|oxidating]] firing by contrast, a continuous supply of oxygen is maintained. The iron in the clay absorbs oxygen and becomes the red or red-brown [[Iron(III) oxide]]. The resulting pottery has a red-brown colour.&lt;ref name="Köhler71" /&gt;

The simplest and earliest firing method is the [[Pit fired pottery|open fire]]. The vessel to be fired is covered and filled with flammable material. It is placed on the a flat piece of ground, surrounded by a low wall, or put in a pit. During the firing process, the potter has relatively little control. The vessel is in direct contact with the flames and the fuel, which heats quickly and then cools down again quickly.&lt;ref name="MAT127" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Köhler71" /&gt;

Optimisation of the firing process became possible once the pottery was placed inside a chamber with a vent and separated from the fuel of the fire, i.e. a [[kiln]]. This technological leap was made in the early Old Kingdom at the latest, but possibly in the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|early dynastic]] or late predynastic period.&lt;ref name="Köhler72"&gt;C. Köhler: ''Buto III. Die Keramik von der späten Vorgeschichte bis zum frühen Alten Reich (Schicht III bis VI).'' Mainz 1998, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest form of a kiln was a shaft with no separation of the area where the fuel was burnt from the chamber where the ceramics were placed. This could be loaded through a shaft and then set on fire through an opening on the ground. This opening enabled a continuous supply of oxygen, which could be used to create an oxidising atmosphere. The oven now had to reach a set firing temperature in order to heat the clay in the firing chamber. As a result, the fire lasted longer and burnt more consistently.&lt;ref name="Köhler72" /&gt;

The next technological advance was the introduction of a grating, which separated the fuel from the pottery being fired. This prevented smoky flames and carbonised fuel from coming in contact with the ceramics and leaving flecks and smudges on it.&lt;ref name="Köhler72" /&gt; The vessels being fired were placed in the upper part, with the opening underneath. The hot air rose up to the vessels and circulated around them, indirectly firing the clay.&lt;ref name="MAT128"&gt;Janine D. Bourriau, Paul T. Nicholson, Pamela J. Rose: "Pottery." In: Paul T. Nicholson, Ian Shaw (ed.): ''Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology.'' Cambridge 2000, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Shaft ovens of this type, with a grating, are attested in Egyptian art and by archaeology from the Old Kingdom onwards.

== Decoration ==

Egyptian potters employed a broad range of decorative techniques and motifs, many of which are characteristic of specific periods. There are three points in the manufacturing process in which decoration could be added: before, during, or after the firing process.

Since the predynastic period, potters added decorative elements in the molding stage, creating unusual shapes or imitating other materials, like basketwork, metal, wood or stone. The majority of the 'fancy features'&lt;ref&gt;[[Flinders Petrie|W. M. Flinders Petrie]], James Edward Quibell: ''Naqada and Ballas. 1895.'' Quaritch, London 1896, p. 37 ([https://archive.org/details/cu31924028748261 Online]).&lt;/ref&gt; were created during the process of shaping the vessel and smoothing its surfaces, long before it was fired. The elements were either shaped from a piece of clay by hand or impressed into the clay while it was still malleable - often causing fingerprints to be left on the inside of the vessel. In figural vessels, these were often parts of a human or animal body, or the face of the god [[Bes]] or the goddess [[Hathor]]. It was also common to cut out parts of the vessel in order to imitate another type of material.&lt;ref&gt;D. Arnold, J. Bourriau: ''An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Pottery.'' Mainz 1993, pp. 88 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in the earliest Egyptian pottery, produced by an early phase of the [[Merimde culture]], there are incised decorations like the [[herringbone pattern]]. In this technique, the surface of the pot was scratched with a sharp instrument, like a twig, knif, nail, or fingernail before it was fired.&lt;ref&gt;D. Arnold, J. Bourriau: ''An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Pottery.'' Mainz 1993, pp. 89 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pots fired in a firing pit often have a black upper rim. These black rims were increasingly a decorative feature, which required technical knowledge to produce consistently. In combination with a dark-red colour and polish, this ''black-topped'' ware was one of the most fashionable and popular types of pottery. The black colour was a result of [[carbonisation]], created by the introduction of smoke particles to the oven during the firing process for example. Some aspects of this special process are still unclear.&lt;ref&gt;D. Arnold, J. Bourriau: ''An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Pottery.'' Mainz 1993, pp. 94 f.; Alfred Lucas: ''Ancient Egyptian Materials and Industries.'' London, 1962 (3rd ed.), pp. 61–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Painted decoration could be added with a brush before or after firing. For specific patters, paint might be sprayed on the surface of a vessel, or it might be dipped in the paint. There are eight major types of painted pottery from ancient Egypt:&lt;ref&gt;D. Arnold, J. Bourriau: ''An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Pottery.'' Mainz 1993, S. 95 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Petrie's ''white-cross-lined'' style: this pottery is found only in [[Upper Egypt]] in the [[Naqada I]] culture (c. 4000-3500 BC). It s usually made from Nile clay (Nile clay A). The surface is a dark red or reddish brown and is polished. The characteristic feature of this style is the white or cream coloured painting of geometric patterns or (occasionally) animals, plants, people and boats.
* Petrie's ''decorated'' style: this pottery is typical of the [[Naqada II]] and [[Naqada III|III]] cultures (c. 3500-3000 BC). It is usually made of marl clay (marl clay A1). The surface is thoroughly smoothed, but not polished and its colour varies from light red to yellowy grey. Red-brown paint was used to paint a number of motifs - most commonly, ships, deserts, flamingos, people, spirals, wavy lines, and Z-shaped lines.
* ''White background'' style: this style was made in the [[First Intermediate period]], early Middle Kingdom, New Kingdom, and the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late period]]. The surfaces of this style were decorated with various colours on a white background, after firing. The decoration normally depicts carefully designed offering scenes.
* The ''scenic'' style: this style occurred sporadically in all periods. It is very similar to the ''white background'' style, except that the scenes were painted directly onto the surface of the vessel without a white background.
* The ''blue-painted'' style: this style occurred from the middle of the 18th dynasty until the end of the [[20th dynasty]]. It is characterised by the use of blue pigments, along with black, red and occasionally yellow. The main motif is floral decorations: [[lotus flower|lotus]] flowers and buds, and individual petals of various flowers, painted as if they were on a thread draped around the neck and shoulders of the vase. Depictions of young animals and symbols of Hathor and Bes are also encountered. The vessels are usually made of Nile clay.
* The ''brown-and-red painted'' style: this style developed at the beginning of the 18th dynasty from the decorative use of lines in the late Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate period. Unlike the ''blue-painted'' style, this pottery is usually made from marl clay. The style is characterised by very specific decorative patters: a group of two to four parallel lines, with various elements like dots, zigzag lines, wavy lines, and the like painted in between them. These were painted in different colours: either brown elements and red lines or vice versa.
* The ''lotus-flower-and-crosslined-band'' style.

== Objects and function ==

In Egyptology, the term 'pottery' is used to refer to all non-figural objects made from fired clay. The majority of pottery vessels surely served as household wares and were used for the storage, preparation, transport and consumption of food and other raw materials. In addition to this, there were other objects frequently used in the household, like bread moulds, fireboxes, lamps and stands for vessels with round bases. Other types of pottery served ritual purposes. Sometimes water pipes were constructed from amphorae laid back-to-back, but actual ceramic water pipes were only introduced in the [[Roman Egypt|Roman period]]. Musical instruments, like [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s, could also be made from ceramics, in the form of bottles filled with pebbles and then sealed before being fired.&lt;ref name="ArnoldLAe392"&gt;Dorothea Arnold, ''Keramik.'' in Wolfgang Helck, Wolfhart Westendorf: ''Lexikon der Ägyptologie.'' Vol. III, Wiesbaden 1980, col. 392&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MAT142"&gt;Janine D. Bourriau, Paul T. Nicholson, Pamela J. Rose: "Pottery," Paul T. Nicholson, Ian Shaw (ed.): ''Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology.'' Cambridge 2000, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for the function of individual pottery types is given by depictions in tombs, textual descriptions, their shape and design, remains of their contents, and the archaeological context in which they are found. In tombs, pottery is often only sketched out schematically. Nevertheless, in some cases it is possible to identify the function of a vessel based on depictions in tombs. Examples include bread molds, spinning weights, and beer jugs. The shapes of beer jugs make it possible to link them with scenes of beer manufacture, such as the Mastaba of Ti: they are ovoid, round-bodied bottles, often with weakly defined lips, which are generally roughly shaped and are made of clay with a lot of organic matter mixed in.&lt;ref name="MAT142" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Köhler40"&gt;C. Köhler: ''Buto III. Die Keramik von der späten Vorgeschichte bis zum frühen Alten Reich (Schicht III bis VI).'' Mainz 1998, pp. 40 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inscriptions giving the contents of the vessel are not unusual in the New Kingdom. As a result, wine jugs and fish kettles can be identified, although wine jugs were also used for other raw materials, like oil and honey. One of the largest finds of inscribed wine vessels came from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] ([[KV62]]). The inscriptions on the 26 inscribed wine jugs provide more information about the wine they contain than most modern wine labels. The year of the [[lees (fermentation)|lees]] was recorded in the king's regnal years. The quality, the origin of the grapes, the owner of the winery, and the name of the [[vintner]] who was responsible for the actual product were all recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Leonhard H. Lesko: ''Egyptian Wine Produktion During the New Kingdom.'' In: ''The Origins and Ancient History of Wine.'' Amsterdam, 1997, pp. 221 f. andLeonhard H. Lesko: ''King Tut’s Wine Cellar.'' Berkley, 1977, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; (See also {{ill|Wine in ancient Egypt|de|Wein im Alten Ägypten}}).

The vessels themselves provide evidence for their purpose, for example by the type of clay used, the treatment of the outer surface, and the shape of the vessel. Among the significant factors, is whether [[porosity]] was desirable or not. Thus, in modern water jugs like ''zirs'' and ''gullas'', the water seeps through the walls, so that the contents can be cooled through evaporation.&lt;ref name="MAT143"&gt;Janine D. Bourriau, Paul T. Nicholson, Pamela J. Rose: "Pottery." Paul T. Nicholson, Ian Shaw (ed.): ''Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology.'' Cambridge 2000, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; This effect can be best achieved with a bright clay or coating. Thus, Christiana Köhler in her study of the Early dynastic pottery from [[Buto]] was able to identify bottles or jugs with a white coating or light, large-grained marl clay, as water containers. An opposite effect could be created with a dark overcoat. By this, the pores of the outer surface were filled and the walls of the vessel were made impermeable to liquids. This made a vessel low-maintenance and hygienic, since no low-grade food residue would sick to the walls of the vessel. This can be seen, since no drink and food trays and plates can be detected.&lt;ref name="Köhler40" /&gt;

== Social context of production ==
[[File:Musee de Boulaq - Statue (1881) - front - TIMEA-10.jpg|thumb|vertical|Statue of a potter]]
The place of the ceramic industry in the wider social and economic context of ancient Egyptian society has been treated only cursorily in research to date.&lt;ref&gt;Janine D. Bourriau, Paul T. Nicholson, Pamela J. Rose: "Pottery." Paul T. Nicholson, Ian Shaw (ed.): ''Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology.'' Cambridge 2000, pp. 135 ff.; C. Eyre, "Work and organisation of work in the Old Kingdom." in M. A. Powell (ed.): ''Labor in the Ancient Near East.'' (= American Oriental Studies 68) New Haven, 1987 (pp. 5–48), pp. 27, 30; C. Eyre, "Work and organisation of work in the New Kingdom." in M. A. Powell (Hrsg.): ''Labor in the Ancient Near East.'' (= American Oriental Studies 68) New Haven, 1987 (pp. 167–222), p. 193; R. Holthoer: ''New Kingdom Pharaonic Sites: The Pottery.'' Stockholm, 1977; Colin Hope: ''Ancient Pottery.'' Aylesbury, 1987, pp. 7–9; Barry J. Kemp: ''Amarna Reports V.'' London, 1989, pp. 56–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomb decorations and pottery models provide only a few pieces of evidence for the context of pottery production. Depictions from the Old Kingdom are closely linked with brewery and bakery scenes (although these are also depicted separately at times). This indicates that pottery production was an independent part of food production. However, the inhabitants of tombs desired food and drink in the afterlife, not empty vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Janine D. Bourriau, Paul T. Nicholson, Pamela J. Rose, "Pottery." in Paul T. Nicholson, Ian Shaw (ed.), ''Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology.'' Cambridge 2000, pp. 135 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Models of pottery workshops from the First Intermediate period and the Middle Kingdom give only a little indication of where the production took place. In all cases they are depicted in the open air - sometimes in a courtyard. More information is offered by the Middle Kingdom scenes in the tombs at [[Beni Hasan]]. Here pottery production is shown taking place alongside other crafts, like carpentry, metal-working, textile production, and the manufacturing of stone vases - and much less frequently with food production. This trend continues in the only depictions we have from the New Kingdom, in the tomb of Kenamun in Thebes.&lt;ref name="MAT136"&gt;Janine D. Bourriau, Paul T. Nicholson, Pamela J. Rose, "Pottery." in Paul T. Nicholson, Ian Shaw (ed.): ''Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology.'' Cambridge 2000, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

The models only ever show one or two men at work, which might indicate that production was carried out on a small scale. In almost all depictions, the works are male. There are a few examples from the Old Kingdom of women participating in the production process, e.g. helping to load the kiln. Little is known about the individual workers, but they were surely of low social status. That they were not part of higher society is also indicated by the absence of epigraphic evidence for this vocation.&lt;ref name="MAT136" /&gt; This is also illustrated by the ''Satire of the Occupations'':
{{Quote|The potter is beneath the earth,&lt;br /&gt;
although his lifetime is beneath the living.&lt;br /&gt;
He rummages in the mud more than pigs,&lt;br /&gt;
in order to burn his pots.&lt;br /&gt;
His loincloth is stiff from the clay,&lt;br /&gt;
his belt is a rag.&lt;br /&gt;
The air in his nose,&lt;br /&gt;
actually(?) comes from his kiln.|Satire of the Trades&lt;ref&gt;Günter Burkard, Heinz J. Thissen: ''Einführung in die altägyptische Literaturgeschichte. I. Altes und Mittleres Reich.'' Münster, 2008, p. 174. See also Stephan Jäger: ''Altägyptische Berufstypologien.'' Göttingen, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Chnum-ihy-isis.jpg|thumb|The ram-headed potter god [[Khnum]] makes the divine child Ihy (Horus/the king) on a potter's wheel and [[Isis]]-[[Hathor]] fills him with life.]]
On the other hand, pottery production had an important place in Egyptian culture. As part of everyday life it belonged to a level where perfection did not matter. From that point of view it was less about social stratification than about a stratification of the value which people attach to things.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothea Arnold et al.: ''Meisterwerke altägyptischer Keramik. 5000 Jahre Kunst und Kunsthandwerk aus Ton und Fayence: [Ausstellung] Höhr-Grenzhausen, Rastal-Haus, 16. September bis 30. November 1978.'' Förderkreis Westerwald für Kunst und Keramik, Montabaur 1978, {{ISBN|978-3-921548-06-6}}, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; It would therefore be wrong to say that Egyptian potters were despised. There was a strong sense that the process was a creative one. Thus, the word for 'potter' (''qd'') is the same one used for 'building' walls and structures. Even the activities of creator gods were depicted using the image of the potter. The ram-headed creator god [[Khnum]] was shown creating gods, men, animals and plants on the potter's wheel. This suggests high esteem for ceramic production.&lt;ref&gt;D. Arnold et al.: ''Meisterwerke altägyptischer Keramik. ...'' Montabaur 1978, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephan Seidlmayer]] investigated the social and organisational circumstances of pottery production in the transitional period from the Old Kingdom to the Middle Kingdom, asking how the archaeological evidence can be connected to the image of the historical situation which we have built up from other sources. He concludes that the economic situation in the Old Kingdom favoured a centralised, standardised, and specialised production in great quantities, using complicated procedures. The organisational capacity of the state enabled focused production with high-quality pottery suitable for storage and transport in the context of the extensive distribution of goods by a centralised system. In the late Old Kingdom and the First Intermediate period, the centralised system deteriorated. It was replaced by decentralised production in small quantities for the circulation of goods within relatively small areas. In order to achieve high output, it was necessary to compromise on the quality of the wares. The profound transformation of the archaeological material indicates the extent of the social transformation which affected the whole cultural system at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Johannes Seidlmayer: ''Gräberfelder aus dem Übergang vom Alten zum Mittleren Reich. Studien zur Archäologie der Ersten Zwischenzeit.'' (= ''Studien zur Archäologie und Geschichte.'' Bd. 1). Heidelberger Orientverlag, Heidelberg 1990, {{ISBN|978-3-927552-01-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic context of production ==
[[File:Kiln-ayn-asil.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of a pottery workshop from Ayn-Asil of the First Intermediate Period]]
E. Christiana Köhler has shown that non-industrial system of pottery production, based in individual households, developed in late predynastic [[Buto]] in particular, as a result of the unfavourable climatic conditions of the [[Nile delta]]. At the same time, specialisation can already be seen in pottery production in the late Naqada I and early Naqada II cultures in [[Upper Egypt]], where the typical pottery found in settlements is a simple, tempered, weak Nile-clay pottery (''Rough ware''). However, the typical red ware for cemeteries, the ''Red-polished'' and ''Black-topped'' ware, was made entirely differently: "whereas the rough ware of the settlements was fired at only c. 500-800 °C, temperatures of up to 1000 °C were used for the red wares." Although the red ware had a fine-grained, thick fabric, it was only occasionally tempered and it required a controlled firing process. This situation suggests that two different systems of manufacture already existed: a professional, specialised industry making funerary pottery and household production of rough wares.&lt;ref&gt;C. Köhler: ''Buto III. Die Keramik von der späten Vorgeschichte bis zum frühen Alten Reich (Schicht III bis VI).'' Mainz 1998, pp. 75 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The environment of Upper Egypt seems to have been more conducive to specialised pottery production. In densely settled areas like [[Hierakonpolis]] and [[Naqada]], there was also heavy demand for pottery. "In the course of Naqada II, a society developed in Upper Egypt which placed significant value in their burials and the grave goods that they included in them, so that the demand for high-value pottery quickly increased." Only for funerary pottery does there seem to have been any demand for professional pottery, since the fine wares are regularly found in graves and very rarely in settlement contexts.&lt;ref&gt;C. Köhler: ''Buto III. Die Keramik von der späten Vorgeschichte bis zum frühen Alten Reich (Schicht III bis VI).'' Mainz 1998, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best archaeological evidence for pottery production is provided by kilns:&lt;ref&gt;Janine D. Bourriau, Paul T. Nicholson, Pamela J. Rose, "Pottery", in  Paul T. Nicholson, Ian Shaw (ed.): ''Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology.'' Cambridge 2000, pp. 137 ff. The list makes no claim to completeness and includes only clearly identifiable objects.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Even in the predynastic period, pottery production in Hierakonpolis had reached amazing heights. Fifteen kiln complexes have been identified. The excavated kilns are not very technologically advanced, but they produced at least three different kinds of ware in many different forms for both household and funerary use.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A Hoffman et al.: ''The Predynastic of Hierakonpolis: an Interim Report'' (= ''Publication [Egyptian Studies Association] Nr. 1).'' Cairo University Herbarium, Faculty of Science, Giza 1982/ Western Illinois University, Macomb Ill 1982, {{ISBN|978-977-721-653-1}}; Masahiro Baba: "Pottery production at Hierakonpolis during the Naqada II period: Toward a reconstruction of the firing technique." ''British Museum Studies in Ancient Egypt and Sudan.'' No. 13, 2009, pp. 1–23 ([http://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/Baba.pdf online]; PDF; 9,8&amp;nbsp;MB).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the late [[5th dynasty|5th]] or early [[6th dynasty]], pottery was manufactured in the [[Mortuary temple]] of the [[Pyramid of Khentkaus II]] in [[Abusir]]. It was a small worship, dated rather later than the actual establishment. Inside the temple, there was a manufacturing area, a storage space and a kiln. Possibly vessels were manufactured here for cult purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Miroslav Verner: "Discovery of a potter’s workshop in the pyramid complex of Khentkaus at Abusir." ''Cahiers de la Céramique Égyptienne.'' (CCE)  Vol. 3, 1992, pp. 55–60.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Near the mortuary temple of [[Menkaure]] at [[Giza]], an industrial area has been excavated, which included kilns. [[Mark Lehner]] also identified possible locations for the mixing of the clay. All food production and pottery production was subordinate to worship.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Lehner, "Giza. A contextual approach to the Pyramids." ''Archiv für Orientforschung.'' No. 32, 1985 (pp. 136–158), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Elephantine]], there were kilns outside the walls of the city, which were established in the Old Kingdom. They date to the middle of the 4th C BC, through to the early 5th century BC, and were part of a substantial industry.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kaiser, R. Avila, G. Dreyer, H. Jaritz, F. Seidelmayer, p. Seidelmeyer, "Stadt und Tempel von Elephantine." ''Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts, Abteilung Kairo.'' Nr. 38, 1982 (pp. 271–345), p. 296 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The best example of a workshop in a settlement context, comes from Ayn Asil in the [[Dakhla Oasis]]. These workshops produced pottery from the end of the Old Kingdom into the First Intermediate Period and were located outside the settlement's walls, like the kilns in Elephantine. It is estimated that they were operated by teams of five to ten workers, working with a wide variety of clays and producing a number of different forms. The presence of bread moulds in these workshops led the excavators to conclude that there was no household pottery production in the community, since these would be the most likely things to be produced in individual households. However, not all the city's needs were met by this production and only a little locally produced pottery was found in the city's cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;G. Soukiassian, M. Wuttmann, L. Pantalacci, P. Ballet, M. Picon: ''Balat III. Les Ateliers de Potiers d’Ayn-Asil.'' Kairo 1990; A. Minault-Gout, P. Deleuze: ''La mastaba d’Ima-Pépi.'' Cairo 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Nag el-Baba in [[Nubia]] a pottery workshop has been uncovered, which was active from the [[12th dynasty]] to the [[Second Intermediate period]]. It was a compound with several rooms, including some for the preparation of the clay and one with a 'simple' oven. Some tools were also identified, including probable fragments of a potter's wheel.&lt;ref&gt;R. Holthoer: ''New Kingdom Sites: The Pottery.'' Stockholm 1977, pp. 16–17; T. Säve-Söderbergh: ''Middle Nubian Sites.'' Partille 1989, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Several kilns have been identified in [[Akhenaten]]'s capital city of [[Amarna]], as well as traces of both industrial and household pottery production.&lt;ref&gt;P. T.

* Remains of workshops from about the same time as those at Amarna have been found at Harube in north [[Sinai]]. They were located outside the settlement, near the granaries and contained areas for preparing the clay and for kilns. They fulfilled the demand of nearby garrisons and official convoys passing through the area.&lt;ref&gt;E. D. Oren: "The 'Ways of Horus' in North Sinai," in A. F. Rainey (ed.), ''Egypt, Israel, Sinai.

== Classification and analysis ==
Various methods have been developed in archaeology for the classification of Egyptian pottery. The most important is called the Vienna system. This system is based on the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;C. Köhler: ''Buto III. Die Keramik von der späten Vorgeschichte bis zum frühen Alten Reich (Schicht III bis VI).'' Mainz 1998, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Fabric: this indicates the type of clay, and whether it consists of a combination of types of clay and temper or additives.
* Form: this includes changes to the mixture introduced by the potter, such as temper-additives and surface treatments.
* Ware: this can encompass a number of different styles with the same clay-mixture.
* Fracture/fracturing: this refers to the assessment of the way in which [[sherd]]s break.

=== The Vienna system ===
The 'Vienna System' is a classification system for Egyptian pottery, which was developed by Dorothea Arnold, [[Manfred Bietak]], [[Janine Bourriau]], Helen and Jean Jacquet and [[Hans-Åke Nordström]] at a conference in Vienna in 1980. All of them brought sherds from their own excavations which formed the basis for the classification system, with a few exceptions. As a result, the system is mainly based on find spots of the 'classic' periods and regions of Egypt. According to the group who developed it, the system was only intended as a departure point, a guide for the description of pottery. The classification of the various wares is based on the measurement of the size of the organic and non-organic components of the pottery fabric.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Åke Nordström, Janine Bourriau, "Ceramic Technology: Clays and Fabrics." in Dorothea Arnold, Janine Bourriau (ed.), ''An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Pottery.'' Fascicle 2 (= ''Deutsches archäologisches Institut, Abteilung Kairo.'' Sonderschrift 17). von Zabern, Mainz 1993, pp. 168–182; Hans-Åke Nordström: "Ton," Wolfgang Helck, Wolfhart Westendorf (ed.) ''Lexikon der Ägyptologie.'' Vol. VI, Wiesbaden 1986, col. 629–634; Janine D. Bourriau, Paul T. Nicholson, Pamela J. Rose, "Pottery," in Paul T. Nicholson, Ian Shaw (ed.): ''Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology.'' Cambridge 2000, pp. 130–132.&lt;/ref&gt;

The components are divided into three groups according to their size. Mineral particles like sand and [[limestone]] are classified as fine (60-250 [[micrometre|μm]]), medium (250-500 μm), and large (larger than 500 μm), while straw is categorised as fine (smaller than 2&amp;nbsp;mm), medium (2–5&amp;nbsp;mm), and large (over 5&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref&gt;H.-Å. Nordström, J. Bourriau: ''Ceramic Technology: Clays and Fabrics.'' Mainz 1993, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The meaningfulness of the system is limited somewhat by the caprice of the potter and a degree of accident during manufacture. The system also provides various criteria for the subdivision of Nile clay and marl clay, "thus the marl clay consists of naturally occurring geological groupings, but with Nile clay the different mixtures were created artificially." The system does not take account of surface treatment.&lt;ref&gt;C. Köhler: ''Buto III. Die Keramik von der späten Vorgeschichte bis zum frühen Alten Reich (Schicht III bis VI).'' Mainz 1998, pp. 13 f.&lt;/ref&gt; The system is only of limited use for predynastic pottery and pottery that post-dates the New Kingdom. This shows the uncertain state of published research on these periods and the large variation in technique, distribution and raw material which occurred in both of these periods.&lt;ref&gt;Janine D. Bourriau, Paul T. Nicholson, Pamela J. Rose, "Pottery," Paul T. Nicholson, Ian Shaw (ed.): ''Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology.'' Cambridge 2000, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nile clay A ====
[[File:KHM-Keramik-001.jpg|thumb|vertical|Nile clay A; Black-topped pottery; Naqada Ic-IIb]]
The fabric consists of a fine, homogeneous clay and a significant proportion of loam. Components are fine sand, a conspicuous amount of medium-grained sand and occasionally large grains of sand. [[Mica]] also occurs. Small amounts of tiny straw particles can occur, but they are not typical of this form. The quantity of clay and loam and the fine particles suggests that the sand is a natural component, not an addition for tempering.&lt;ref&gt;H.-Å. Nordström, J. Bourriau: ''Ceramic Technology: Clays and Fabrics.'' Mainz 1993, pp. 170 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nile clay B ====
Nile clay B is subdivided into B1 and B2:
* B1: The fabric is relatively muddy and not as fine as Nile clay A. There is a lot of fine sand, with isolated particles of medium and large grains of sand. Mica particles are common. Isolated fine particles of straw also occaw. Surfaces and incisions are often in the original red-brown, but black/gray or black/red areas can occur. This type is common from the Old Kingdom until the beginning of the 18th dynasty. It is the raw material for the spherical bowls and 'cups' of the Middle Kingdom and especially characteristic of the fine wares of the Delta and the region of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]-[[Fayyum]] in that period.&lt;ref&gt;H.-Å. Nordström, J. Bourriau: ''Ceramic Technology: Clays and Fabrics.'' Mainz 1993, S. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;
* B2: The fabric is similar to B1, but the mineral and organic components have larger grains and are more frequent. There are large amounts of fine sand and sand grains of medium size are common. Rounded grains of sandstone occur with limestone grains which show some signs of weathering. The demarcation between B and C is not very clear, especially between B2 and C. One aid in distinguishing them is that sand rather than straw is the main additive in type B. Unlike B1, B2 is common in all periods and regions. For example, Dorothea Arnold identified four varieties of it in [[Lisht]]-South. Manfred Bietak identified a large-grained variant from the Second Intermediate Period at [[Tell El-Dab'a]]. Other examples include the late 12th and 13th dynasties at [[Dahshur]] and the late 18th dynasty at [[Karnak]].&lt;ref&gt;H.-Å. Nordström, J. Bourriau: ''Ceramic Technology: Clays and Fabrics.'' Mainz 1993, pp. 171 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

File:Nile-b2-003.jpg|Nile clay B
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Nile clay C ====
This material consists of muddy clay with rough or smooth grains of sand which can vary from fine to large and in frequency from seldom to often. Additives like limestone and other minerals, such as mica, crushed sherds of pottery and medium-grained stone particles, can occur. Straw is the dominant additive and is often visible in incisions and on the surface. These straw particles range from fine to large, with a large amount of large particles (over 5&amp;nbsp;mm). The straw is preserved as charred particles, appearing as white or grey [[silica]] and as impressions in the paste. Nile clay C occurs in all periods and regions, and includes a wide variety of variants.&lt;ref&gt;H.-Å. Nordström, J. Bourriau: ''Ceramic Technology: Clays and Fabrics.'' Mainz 1993, pp. 173 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery widths=180&gt;

File:Nile-c2.jpg|Nile clay C2
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Nile clay D ====
[[File:Nile-d.jpg|thumb|Nile clay D]]
The main sign of Nile clay D is the conspicuous quantity of limestone, which might be either a natural component or a tempering additive. Without this visible limestone component, this type of clay would be classified differently, as Nile clay A (at Tell el-Dab'a), lightly fired Nile clay B (at Dahshur), or as Nile clay B2 - C (at Memphis).&lt;ref&gt;H.-Å. Nordström, J. Bourriau: ''Ceramic Technology: Clays and Fabrics.'' Mainz 1993, pp. 174 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nile clay E ====
This clay consists of a large amount of rounded sand particles, ranging from fine to large grains, which are clearly visible on the surface and in fractures. Aside from these diagnostic components, the fabric can look characteristic of Nile clay B or Nile clay C. Nile clay E has so far only been identified in a few locations: in the eastern Delta (Tell el-Dab’a and [[Qantir]]) and the region of Memphis and the southern Fayyum.&lt;ref&gt;H.-Å. Nordström, J. Bourriau: ''Ceramic Technology: Clays and Fabrics.'' Mainz 1993, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Marl clay A ====
[[File:RPM Ägypten 123.jpg|thumb|Marl clay A1]]
This group is divided into four variants. The shared characteristics of Marl clay A are its compact and homogeneous fabric, the fine mineral components and very low proportion of organic substances.
* Marl clay A1: The fabric consists of a relatively fine and homogeneous clay, tempered with visible particles of fine-to-medium grained limestone. This is the most visible aspect in fractures and outer surfaces. The particles are sharp and vary in size from 60-400 μm, with occasional larger particles. Fine sand and dark mica particles are common. Organic additives (straw) occur occasionally. This clay was common from Naqada II to the Old Kingdom and is one of the fabrics of Meidum ware.&lt;ref name="autogenerated176"&gt;H.-Å. Nordström, J. Bourriau: ''Ceramic Technology: Clays and Fabrics.'' Mainz 1993, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marl clay A2: In this variant, the mineral additives are very fine and homogeneously distributed through the paste. Fine sand and limestone particles are present but do not dominate. Dark mica particles are present in small quantities. Marl clay A2 occurred from the Middle Kingdom, but is most common between the late Second Intermediate period and the 18th dynasty, mainly in Upper Egypt.&lt;ref name="autogenerated176"/&gt;
* Marl clay A3: This clay looks the most similar to modern Qena clay, although we cannot be sure that it came from this same region. A few mineral additives are visible under magnification in fractures and there is little sign that these were added as temper. The past is extraordinarily fine and homogeneous, which could indicate careful preparation of the clay, probably with a mortar. Occasionally, straw particles occur. This fabric occurs from the early Middle Kingdom into the New Kingdom, and seems to stem from Upper Egypt. On the other hand, it only rarely occurs in the eastern Delta (Tell el-Dab'a and Qantir) and the Memphis-Fayyum region.&lt;ref&gt;H.-Å. Nordström, J. Bourriau: ''Ceramic Technology: Clays and Fabrics.'' Mainz 1993, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marl clay A4: Of all the variants of Marl clay A, this has the greatest mix and quantity of fine and large sand particles. Mica particles and (often) straw particles can also occur. This clay already occurred in the Middle Kingdom, but is most common in the New Kingdom (Amarna, [[Malqata]], Memphis, [[Saqqara]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;H.-Å. Nordström, J. Bourriau: ''Ceramic Technology: Clays and Fabrics.'' Mainz 1993, pp. 177 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Marl clay B ====
The fabric is homogeneous and very thick. The diagnostic feature of the fabric is its high sand content, which makes up roughly 40% of the paste and was added as temper. The particles range from angular to vaguely rounded and from fine to large. As in Marl clay A4, limestone additives are visible under magnification, appearing as a calcareous material in the clay's fabric at 45x magnification. Marl clay B was mainly used for large and mid-sized vessels and seems to be very restricted in space and time, to the Second Intermediate period and New Kingdom in Upper Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;H.-Å. Nordström, J. Bourriau: ''Ceramic Technology: Clays and Fabrics.'' Mainz 1993, pp. 178 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Marl clay C ====
This group is divided into three types. The shared feature of all three is the presence of numerous limestone particles, more or less ground down, which range from medium to large in size, and give the material a sparkly appearance. The fabric itself is fine and thick. Fine and medium sand particles, added as temper, are also encountered, as well as light and dark mica.
* Marl clay C1: This variant is defined by the presence of fine to medium ground particles of limestone. Fractures are almost always composed of different zones, each of which are red with a gray or black core and show many signs of prefatory glazing.&lt;ref&gt;H.-Å. Nordström, J. Bourriau: ''Ceramic Technology: Clays and Fabrics.'' Mainz 1993, pp. 179 f.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marl clay C2: Most of the limeston particles remain intact and fractures do not have zones, but a uniform colour which ranges from red ([[Munsell color system|Munsell]] 10R 4/6) to brown (Munsell 5YR 6/6). Another distinction from C1 is the sand temper: in C2 the proportion of sand is larger than that of limestone.&lt;ref&gt;H.-Å. Nordström, J. Bourriau: ''Ceramic Technology: Clays and Fabrics.'' Mainz 1993, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marl clay C compact: This clay has much less sand than C1 and C2 and is much thicker. This variant has thus far only been found in a single type of ware - large, egg-shaped flasks with grooved necks.&lt;ref&gt;H.-Å. Nordström, J. Bourriau: ''Ceramic Technology: Clays and Fabrics.'' Mainz 1993, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Marl clay D ====
The fabric is fine and homogeneous. The characteristic feature is the limestion particles, which were probably added as temper. They are smaller than those in Marl clay C and vary from fine to large in size, forming around 25% of the material (which is less than the limestone temper of Marl clay C). Fine and large-grained sand, black mica, and dark stone are also added as temper. Organic additives are very rare. The surface is notably sandy to the touch. This type of clay was very widespread in the Delta and the Memphis-Fayyum region in the 18th and [[19th dynasty|19th dynasties]] and seems to appear in the south only as imports from the north.&lt;ref&gt;H.-Å. Nordström, J. Bourriau: ''Ceramic Technology: Clays and Fabrics.'' Mainz 1993, pp. 181 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Marl clay E ====
The combination is similar to that in Marl clay B, with the exception of the visible mid-to-large particles of straw, which were added as temper. Sand was also added (medium to large particles, 20-40% of the mass of the clay), as well as particles of mica. This type of clay is relatively rare, but is known in Memphis and Upper Egypt ([[Koptos]] and [[Deir el-Ballas]]), during the short period between the Second Intermediate Period and the early 18th dynasty. It was used mainly for thick-walled vessels, often hand-molded bread tablets. This suggests that the intentional addition of straw might have been connected with this special function.&lt;ref&gt;H.-Å. Nordström, J. Bourriau: ''Ceramic Technology: Clays and Fabrics.'' Mainz 1993, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Köhler code ===
For the predynastic pottery from Buto and [[Helwan]], which only has limited overlap with the Vienna system, E. Christiana Köhler developed a typological code. These five-digit codes are based on various criteria, whereby each digit in the code refers to a particular aspect: 
* Appearance (large/heavy, medium, and fine with the numbers 1-3), 
* Clay type (Nile clay = 1, Marl clay = 2, other clay = 3)
* Surface treatment (very rough = 1, roughly smoothed = 2, well-smoothed = 3, polished = 4)
* Coating (no coating = 0, black = 1, white coating = 2, red = 3, other colour = 4)
* Presence of additives and tempering (normal = 1, mainly straw = 2, mainly sand = 3, significant limestone = 4, very little or none = 5, fibre = 6).&lt;ref&gt;C. Köhler: ''Buto III. Die Keramik von der späten Vorgeschichte bis zum frühen Alten Reich (Schicht III bis VI).'' Mainz 1998, pp. 3 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Petrographic analyses ===
[[petrography|Petrographic]] analysis has also proven useful as a complementary system of classification and analysis to that based on characteristics that are observable to the naked eye or a microscope.&lt;ref&gt;N. Porat &amp; J. Seeher, "Petrographic analyses of pottery and basalt from Predynastic Maadi." ''Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts, Abteilung Kairo'' 44 (1988) pp. 215–228; H.

Morgenstein, "Major and trace element analysis of modern Egyptian pottery," ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' 23 (1996) pp. 741–762.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique examines thin slices of the ceramic material or of extracted mineral additives, in order to get further information on them.&lt;ref&gt;Janine D. Bourriau, Paul T. Nicholson &amp; Pamela J. Rose, "Pottery," Paul T. Nicholson &amp; Ian Shaw (ed.), ''Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology.'' Cambridge 2000, pp. 132 f.&lt;/ref&gt; It can identify various mineral and organic additives. The structure and porosity of the ceramic material can be precisely measured. The original firing temperature can be determined. The origin of the clay can be identified. It also makes it possible to work out whether other particles in the clay arrived their naturally or were added as temper.

=== Chemical and mineralogical analysis ===
Additionally, chemical and mineralogical methods developed by [[archaeological science]] can be deployed to determine the composition of the clay. Such methods include:&lt;ref&gt;Janine D. Bourriau, Paul T. Nicholson &amp; Pamela J. Rose, "Pottery," in Paul T. Nicholson, Ian Shaw (ed.): ''Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology.'' Cambridge (2000) pp. 133 ff. with references to further literature.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pottery dating ==
[[File:Sir (William Matthew) Flinders Petrie by George Frederic Watts.jpg|thumb|[[William Matthew Flinders Petrie]], who developed the method of pottery [[seriation (archaeology)|seriation]].]]
Pottery [[seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] has proven useful for constructing an archaeological relative chronology for Egypt. This method was invented in 1899 by [[Flinders Petrie]]. In the late twentieth century, there has been an enormous increase in the studies of Egyptian pottery, with respect to the quantity of sherds which have been analysed (from a large number of different excavation sites) and the range of investigative techniques that are in use in order to get information out of pottery remains. As a result, the changes in the pottery types have become ever more accurately understood over time. For example, the shape of bread-molds changed drastically at the end of the Old Kingdom, but it is not clear whether this process resulted from social, economic or technological causes, or just fashion. Thus, there are many causes of the changes observed in material culture and only a few can be linked to political changes which dominate traditional perspectives on Egyptian history.

On the other hand, for example, links can be made between political and cultural changes and the changes in pottery from centralised production in the Old Kingdom to the revival of local pottery types during the politically decentralised First Intermediate period to the new unity in the reunified [[12th dynasty]]. Through the study of pottery, along with other artifacts, it is possible to create a holistic narrative of Egyptian history, in which political developments are understood within the context of a long process of cultural change.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Shaw, "Introduction: Chronologies and Cultural Change in Egypt." Ian Shaw: ''The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt.'' Oxford 2002, pp. 13 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Petrie's ''Sequence Dating'' ===
[[File:Cylinder vessel of King Hor Aha from Saqqara, 1st dynasty - Kestner-Museum, Hannover.jpg|thumb|vertical|Cylinder vessel with decorative band, end of the way-handled typology, Naqada IIIC1 period; 1st Dynasty; King [[Hor-Aha|Aha]]]]
W. M. Flinders Petrie was the first to attempt a pottery seriation (which he called a 'Sequence dating'), focused on the pottery of the [[Naqada culture]]. He published his first study of the [[relative chronology]] of the Naqada culture in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Flinders Petrie, "Sequences in Prehistoric Remains," ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute'' (JRAI) 29 (1899), pp. 295–301 ([http://www.uni-kiel.de/ufg/dateien/dateien_studium/Archiv/201011_furholt_hinz_lesenswert/02_sitzung/Petrie.pdf Online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212102233/http://www.uni-kiel.de/ufg/dateien/dateien_studium/Archiv/201011_furholt_hinz_lesenswert/02_sitzung/Petrie.pdf |date=2013-12-12 }}; PDF; 1.5&amp;nbsp;MB).&lt;/ref&gt; His first 'predynastic' corpus was based on the excavations of necropoleis at [[Naqada]], [[Deir el-Ballas]],&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Flinders Petrie, J. E. Quibell: ''Naqada and Ballas. 1895.'' London 1896.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hu, Egypt|Hu]].&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Flinders Petrie, Arthur Cruttenden Mace: ''Diospolis Parva, the cemeteries of Abadiyeh and Hu, 1898-9'' (= ''Memoir.'' Egypt Exploration Fund). London/ Boston Mass 1901 ([https://archive.org/details/diospolisparvac00macegoog Online]).&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, he identified nine classes and over 700 pottery types. For this typology, he selected 900 intact graves containing five or more types, out of the over 4,000 graves that he had excavated. He produced an [[index card]] for each of them and attempted to place these index cards in order. He made two important observations:&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Flinders Petrie: ''Corpus of Prehistoric Pottery and Palettes'' (= ''Publications of the British School of Archaeology in Egypt.''). British school of Archaeology in Egypt, London 1921 ({{Cite web |url=http://languesanciennes.ens-lyon.fr/uploads/petcor00.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181419/http://languesanciennes.ens-lyon.fr/uploads/petcor00.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}; PDF; 3.0&amp;nbsp;MB).&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''White cross-lined'' pottery&lt;ref group="Anm."&gt;''White cross-lined'' pottery mostly consists of Nile clay tempered with sand. The colour of the exterior surface ranges from dark red to reddish brown and is polished. Characteristically, it is painted with white or cream coloured images (geometric patterns, animals, plants, people, and ships.&lt;/ref&gt; practically never occurred with ''Decorated''&lt;ref group="Anm."&gt;''Decorated'' pottery is mostly made of marl clay tempered with sand. The surface is well-smoothed, but not polished. The colour ranges from light red to yellow-gray. The surface was painted with red-brown images. The most common motifs are ships, desert creatures, flamingos, people, spirals, wavy lines and Z-lines.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Wavy-handled'' pottery.&lt;ref group="Anm."&gt;The ''Wavy-Handled'' pottery derives from the Naqada IIc period in appearance. In production and working, they are identical with the ''Decorated'' ware. The outer surface ranges from light red to yellow-gray. The characteristic feature is the wavy-handles.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The form of the ''wavy-handled'' types developed from a bullet-shape to a more cylindrical one, and from functional handles to decorative lines.

After Petre had arranged all his index cards, he divided them into 50 groups, each consisting of 18 tombs. He defined SD 30 as the starting point (numbered thus in order to give space for possible earlier cultures which had not then been discovered. He divided the 50 Sequence dates into three groups, which he classified as 'archaeological', 'cultural', and 'chronological', and named them after important find spots: Amratian (SD 30–37), Gerzean (SD 38–60) and Semainean (SD 60–75).&lt;ref&gt;Stan Hendrickx, "Predynastic – Early Dynastic Chronology.", Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss, David A. Warburton (ed.): ''Ancient Egyptian Chronology.'' Brill, Leiden/ Boston 2006, {{ISBN|978-90-474-0400-2}}, pp. 60 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pietre produced a second corpus of 'protodynastic' pottery,&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Flinders Petrie: ''Corpus of Proto-Dynastic Pottery'' (= ''Publications of the British School of Archaeology in Egypt.'' Vol. 66). British School of Archaeology in Egypt, London 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; based principally on the finds in the necropolis in [[Tarchan]].&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Flinders Petrie, ''Tarkhan I and Memphis V.'' (= ''Publications of the British School of Archaeology in Egypt.'' Vol. 23). British School of Archaeology in Egypt, London 1913 ([https://archive.org/details/tarkhanimemphisv00petr Online]).&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, he identified 885 types, but no classes, which made it difficult for him to use this seriation. This second corpus partially overlapped with the earlier, 'predynastic corpus'. He started with SD 76 and continued to SD 86, with SD 83-86 remaining very theoretical, due to the shortage of material from the 2nd dynasty. This time, Petrie based the transition to a new 'sequence date' mainly on typological breaks, which Petrie defined on the basis of the development of the ''Wavy-handled'' types. He also linked the sequence dates with the historically dated pottery and objects from the royal graves of the early dynasties at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]].&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickx, "Predynastic – Early Dynastic Chronology," ''Ancient Egyptian Chronology.'' Leiden/ Boston 2006, pp. 62 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some methodological issues with Petrie's classification:&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickx, "Predynastic – Early Dynastic Chronology," ''Ancient Egyptian Chronology.'' Leiden/ Boston 2006, p. 63; Stan Hendrickx: "The Relative Chronology of the Naqada Culture. Problems and Possibilities," Jeffrey Spencer: ''Aspects of Early Egypt.'' British Museum Press, London 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-7141-0999-2}}, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is no distinction between typology and chronology.
* The 'classes' were very heterogeneously defined.
* The definitions are not base on strict rules.
* Since only tombs with five or more objects were used, the early periods are under-represented.
* Regional differences were not considered. 
* The horizontal distribution of pottery within a cemetery was not treated as an important criterion.
* A systematic problem was that whenever new tombs were discovered, new types would need to be defined.

=== Kaiser's Stage-chronology ===
[[File:Ägyptisches Museum Leipzig 027 DW.JPG|thumb|vertical|Typical ''decorated'' pottery of period II.]]
The next person to undertake a relative chronology of the predynastic period was {{ill|Werner Kaiser (Egyptologist)|lt=Werner Kaiser|de|Werner Kaiser (Ägyptologe)}}. He largely accepted Petrie's typology and used the necropolis 1400-1500 at [[Armant, Egypt|Armant]] as his starting point.&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Mond, O. H. Myers: ''Cemeteries of Armant I.'' London 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Kaiser also paid attention to the horizontal divisions of the pottery record and if a period was not attested at Armant, he also used pottery from other cemeteries. He identified three broad zones in the cemetery, each of which was dominated by a specific group of pottery: ''Black-topped'', ''Rough wares'', and ''Late'' or ''Wavy-Handled wares''. Within each of these periods, he identified subdivisions, which he called "stages" (''Stufen''). These largely agreed with Petrie's divisions, but not entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Kaiser, "Zur inneren Chronologie der Naqadakultur," ''Archaeologia Geographica'' No. 6 (1957) pp. 69–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following were the main stages, according to Kaiser:

* Stage I: All findspots in Upper Egypt include this stage, from the [[Badari culture|Badari]] regions to south of [[Aswan]]. Cemeteries were dominated by the ''Black-topped'' pottery&lt;ref group="Anm."&gt;''Black-topped'' pottery was made of Nile clay tempered with sand and is typical of Naqada I and IIa-b. Its key characteristics are a black rim and a dark red or reddish brown outer surface, which is nearly always polished.&lt;/ref&gt; which made up more than 50% of the total assemblage. The second most common types are ''Red-polished''&lt;ref group="Anm."&gt;''Red-Polished'' pottery is identical tothe ''Black-topped'' pottery except that it lacks the black rim.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''White Cross-Lined'' pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickx, "Predynastic – Early Dynastic Chronology." ''Ancient Egyptian Chronology.'' Leiden/ Boston 2006, pp. 71 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stage II: According to Werner Kaiser's definition, this stage was dominated by the ''Rough'' pottery.&lt;ref group="Anm."&gt;''Rough'' pottery is made of Nile clay, heavily tempered with straw. The outer surfaces are only roughly smoothed, with a red-brown colour and no glaze.&lt;/ref&gt; However in Stage IIa, the ''Black-topped'' pottery increasingly overtakes the ''Rough'' pottery. During the transition from Stage IIb to IIc, the ''Wavy-Handled'' pottery came into use. Some new ''Decorated'' types also appeared at this point.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickx, "Predynastic – Early Dynastic Chronology," ''Ancient Egyptian Chronology.'' Leiden/ Boston 2006, pp. 75 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Stage III: In this stage, the ''Late'' pottery occurs,&lt;ref group="Anm."&gt;''Late'' pottery is made of the same material as the ''Decorated'' and ''Wavy-Handled'' wares and includes various kinds of vessel which only came into use in the later Naqada period. Aside from this, some of it cannot be distinguished from ''Rough'' ware.&lt;/ref&gt; outnumbering the ''Rough'' pottery. This stage is particularly important for the relative chronology of the predynastic and early dynastic periods, since it is contains the final stage of state formation and can partially be connected with the historical chronology of the First and Second dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickx, "Predynastic – Early Dynastic Chronology," ''Ancient Egyptian Chronology.'' Leiden/Boston 2006, pp. 81 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were still some problems with this chronology:&lt;ref&gt;S. Hendrickx, "Predynastic – Early Dynastic Chronology," ''Ancient Egyptian Chronology.'' Leiden/Boston 2006, pp. 64 ff.; S. Hendrickx, "The Relative Chronology of the Naqada Culture," ''Aspects of Early Egypt.'' London 1996, p. 38 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It was almost entirely based on a single cemetery, which made it impossible to detect regional differences.
* Stages Ia, Ib and IIIb are pretty much hypothetical, especially the development of the ''Wavy-Handled'' class.
* Kaiser published only a short summary in the form of an article, which only illustrated the characteristic types for each stage.

=== Stan Hendrickx ===
Since the mid-1980s, [[Stan Hendrickx]] has extended and improved Werner Kaiser's model. He based his work on the principle of studying groups of graves as a unit (thus also respecting divisions of space within an individual cemetery), rather than just studying individual graves and their contents. As a result he faced a conflict between developing a tight relative chronology of all individual pottery types and defining chronologically indicative assemblages. He could not accept a higher priority being given to either of these criteria.&lt;ref&gt;S. Hendrickx, "Predynastic – Early Dynastic Chronology," ''Ancient Egyptian Chronology.'' Leiden/Boston 2006, pp. 55–93.; S. Hendrickx, "The Relative Chronology of the Naqada Culture," ''Aspects of Early Egypt.'' London 1996, S. 36–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computer seriation ===
[[Barry Kemp (Egyptologist)|Barry Kemp]] undertook a multi-dimensional analysis of the tombs in Necropolis B at [[el-Amrah]] and the Necropolis at el-Mahasna. These seriations were only used to evaluate Petrie's Sequence dating, not Kaiser's Stage-chronology.&lt;ref&gt;B. J. Kemp, "Automatic Analysis of Predynastic Cemeteries: A New Method for an Old Problem," ''Journal of Egyptian Archaeology.'' 68 (1982) pp. 5–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toby Wilkinson]] undertook a seriation of eight predynastic and early dynastic necropoleis, based on 1420 types from Petrie's corpus (out of a total of 1542), which he arranged into 141 groups. There were large problems with the newly defined groups, since they were very heterogenously defined. For example, the cylindrical vessels with and without incised decoration were placed in the same group, even though Kaiser had considered the presence of incision to be an important chronological indicator.&lt;ref&gt;T. A. H. Wilkinson, "A New Comparative Chronology for the Predynastic – Early Dynastic Transition," ''Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum.'' (JACF) 7 (1994–1995) pp. 5–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:И звезда с звездою Фронтиспис.jpg|thumb|Aoid and [[Outer space]]. [[Allegory]] by Mikhail Kurushin&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ban'kowski|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Greek language|Greek]] word '''''aoidos''''' ({{lang|grc|ἀοιδός}}) referred to a [[Ancient Greek language|classical Greek]] singer. In modern [[Homeric scholarship]] ''aoidos'' is used by some as the technical term for a skilled [[oral poetry|oral epic poet]] in the tradition to which the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' are believed to belong (compare [[rhapsode]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hence the English translators of {{Harv|Latacz|2004}} use '''aoidean poetry''' as a technical term for early Greek oral epic poetry.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Song and poetry in the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' ==

In classical Greek the word ''aoidos'', "singer", is an agent noun derived from the verb ''aeidein'' ({{lang|grc|ὰείδειν}}) or ''adein'' ({{lang|grc|ᾄδειν}}), "to sing". It occurs several times in varying forms in the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' in relation to poetry:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Dalby|2006|pp=4–19}} for this list, with discussion of related passages from early Greek literature. Other mentions of singers (but no performance) are at ''Iliad'' 2.594-600 (the story of [[Thamyris]]) and ''Odyssey'' 9.2-11.&lt;/ref&gt; 

* ''Iliad'' 18.490–496 (on the [[Shield of Achilles]]): a wedding song, ''hymenaios'', with pipes, lyres, and dancing
* ''Odyssey'' 23.133–135: a wedding song with dancing, led by the singer [[Phemius]]: there is no wedding but Odysseus wants to create the impression of festivity while he is killing the suitors
* ''Iliad'' 18.567–572 (on the Shield of Achilles): a child sings and plays the lyre to accompany the vintage. The song is the ''[[Linus (mythology)|linos]]''
* ''Iliad'' 18.593–606 (on the Shield of Achilles): young men and women take part in a singing-dance, ''molpe''
* ''Odyssey'' 8.250–385: young men and women take part in a ''molpe''; [[Demodocus (Odyssey character)|Demodocus]] sings and plays the lyre; his song is about the love affair of [[Ares]] and [[Aphrodite]]
* ''Iliad'' 22.391–393: [[Achilles]]' young warriors sing a ''paieon'', a song of praise or self-praise, as they drag [[Hector]]'s body back to their ships
* ''Iliad'' 24.720–761: in Troy, singers lead the lament over Hector's body and women mourn after them; the three women who perform laments individually are [[Andromache]], [[Hecuba]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]
* ''Iliad'' 19.301–338: in the Greek camp, over the body of [[Patroclus]], Achilles sings first, then [[Briseis]] followed by the women, then Achilles again followed by the old men
* ''Odyssey'' 24.58–62: in the Greek camp (as described by [[Agamemnon]]'s ghost) the sea nymphs lament over Achilles's body and the [[Muses]] respond, followed by all the Greeks
* ''Iliad'' 9.186–191: Achilles "pleases his mind and sings of the fame of men", accompanying himself on the lyre; his only audience is Patroclus
* ''Odyssey'' 1.150–340: Phemius sings for the suitors, after dinner, a narrative song of the ''[[Nostoi|Return from Troy]]''
* ''Odyssey'' 8.73–75: Demodocus sings for [[Alcinous]] and his guests, after dinner, a narrative song of the quarrel of [[Odysseus]] and Achilles
* ''Odyssey'' 8.536–538: Demodocus begins to sing for [[Alcinous]] and his guests, after dinner, a narrative song of the [[Trojan Horse|Wooden Horse]].

== The profession of singer ==

In the world described in these poems writing is practically unknown (though its use is implied in one minor episode, the story of [[Bellerophontes]]);&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 6.168-170.&lt;/ref&gt; all poetry is "song", and poets are "singers". Later, in the fifth and fourth centuries, the performance of epic poetry was called ''rhapsodia'', and its performer ''[[Rhapsode|rhapsodos]]'', but the word does not occur in the early epics or in contemporary lyric poetry, so it is unknown whether Hesiod and the poet(s) of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' would have considered themselves rhapsodes (it has been argued by [[Walter Burkert]], and is accepted by some recent scholars, that ''rhapsodos'' was by definition a performer of a fixed, written text and not a creative oral poet).&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{Harv|Burkert|1987}}; {{Harv|Graziosi|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not even known to what extent the makers of oral epic poetry were specialists. [[Phemius]] and [[Demodocus (Odyssey character)|Demodocus]], in the ''Odyssey'', are depicted performing non-epic as well as epic songs.

There was, however, certainly a profession of ''aoidos''. [[Eumaeus]], a character in the ''Odyssey'', says that singers (''aoidoi''), healers, seers and craftsmen are likely to be welcomed as guests, while beggars are not;&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' 17.382-387.&lt;/ref&gt; outside the world described by Homer, [[Hesiod]] gives a similar list in the form of a proverb on professional jealousy:

{{cquote|Potter hates potter and craftsman hates craftsman;&lt;br/&gt;Beggar is jealous of beggar, singer of singer.
|source=Hesiod, ''[[Works and Days]]'' 25–26.}}

According to the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' singers gained their inspiration from the [[Muses]]. Hesiod describes how the Muses visited him while he tended his sheep on [[Mount Helicon]] and granted him this inspiration, permitting him to sing of the future as well as the past. An anecdote in the ''Iliad'' about [[Thamyris]] shows that the Muses could take away what they had given.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]'' 22-32; ''Iliad'' 2.594-600.&lt;/ref&gt; As in certain other cultures, blind men sometimes became singers: Demodocus in the ''Odyssey'' is blind, and the legendary creator of the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'', Homer, was often said to have been blind.

The audience for performances by ''aoidoi'' varied depending on the genre and circumstances (see list above). Women participated in, and sometimes led, laments, according to the ''Iliad''. Many of the poems of [[Sappho]] are addressed to women and seem to assume an audience of women. For narrative (epic) poetry it is sometimes said that the audience was exclusively male; this is an exaggeration (for example, Penelope listens to, and interrupts, one performance depicted in the ''Odyssey'') but it is probably largely true owing to the seclusion of women in early Greece.

== ''Aoidoi'' and the creation of the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' ==

It has been shown from comparative study of orality that the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' (as well as the works of [[Hesiod]]) come from a tradition of oral epics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Parry|Parry|1971}}; {{Harv|Lord|1953}}; {{Harv|Lord|1960}}; see also [[Homeric scholarship#The 20th century|Homeric scholarship]].&lt;/ref&gt; In oral narrative traditions there is no exact transmission of texts; rather, stories are transmitted from one generation to another by bards, who make use of formulas to aid in remembering vast numbers of lines. These poets were bearers of the early Greek oral epic tradition, but little is known of them. Whenever the writing took place (dates between 750 and 600 BC are most often proposed), any contemporary poets and writers who may have known of it did not notice the event or name the poet(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Dalby|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to classical Greek sources, Homer lived long before the two poems were written down.&lt;ref&gt;One ancient text, a ''[[Life of Homer (Pseudo-Herodotus)|Life of Homer]]'' which claims to be by [[Herodotus]], asserts that the poems were written from Homer's own dictation. This ''Life'' is an evident forgery and quite unconvincing {{Harv|Lefkowitz|1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''artistic director''' may refer to someone who directs a [[musical ensemble]], and in this medium, is often abbreviated as simply Director. The typical jobs of a musical artistic director are to choose repertoire for the ensemble, come up with an artistic vision for the group and also a long-term strategy for programming, and also to help choose performers if the ensemble is not pre-set. An artistic director may also be—and often is—the conductor of the ensemble and a "jack of all trades", performing multiple roles and even managing the ensemble, although that role is often left to a [[Managing Director]] if financial resources are available. A musical artistic director essentially mirrors a theatrical [[artistic director]], albeit working in a different medium.

In [[ancient Rome]], the principle of private [[Voluntary association|association]] was recognized very early by the state. ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sodalitas|Sodalitates]]'' for [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious purposes]] are mentioned in the [[XII Tables]],&lt;ref&gt;Gaius in ''Digest,'' 47. 22. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and ''collegia opificum,'' or [[trade guild]]s, were believed to have been instituted by [[Numa Pompilius]], which probably means that they were regulated by the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ius divinum|jus divinum]]'' as being associated with particular cults.

It can be difficult to distinguish between the two words ''[[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegium]]'' and ''sodalitas''. ''Collegium'' is the wider of the two in meaning, and may be used for associations of all kinds, public and private, while ''sodalitas'' is more especially a union for the purpose of maintaining a cult. Both words indicate the permanence of the object undertaken by the association, while a ''societas'' is a temporary combination without strictly permanent duties.

==Trade associations==

The ''collegia opificum'' ascribed to Numa&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]] ''Numa,'' 17&lt;/ref&gt; include guilds of weavers, fullers, dyers, shoemakers, doctors, teachers, painters, and other occupations, as listed by Ovid in the ''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]] ''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]],'' ~ 819.&lt;!--book number missing--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid says they were in origin associated with the cult of [[Minerva]], the goddess of handiwork. [[Plutarch]] mentions [[aulos|flute-players]], who were connected with the cult of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] on the Capitol, as well as guilds of smiths, goldsmiths, tanners.

Though these guilds may not have had a religious purpose, like all early institutions they were associated with some religious cult, and in most cases the cult of [[Minerva]]. Almost all these ''collegia'' had their religious centre and business headquarters at her temple on the [[Aventine Hill]]. When a guild of poets was instituted during the [[Second Punic War]], this too had its meeting-place in the same temple.

The purpose of the guild in each case was no doubt to protect and advance the interests of the trade, but little information for them exists until the age of [[Cicero]], when they reappear in the form of political clubs (''collegia sodalicia'' or ''compitalicia'') chiefly with the object of securing the election of candidates for [[Roman magistrates|magistracies]]. The political ''collegia'' were suppressed by a ''[[senatus consultum]]'' in 64 BC, revived by [[Clodius]] six years later, and finally abolished by [[Julius Caesar]], as dangerous to public order.

The principle of the trade guild reasserts itself under the [[Roman Empire|Empire]], and is found at work in Rome and in every [[municipium|municipal town]]. Though the right of permitting such associations belonged to the government, these trade guilds were recognized by the state as being instituted "ut necessariam operam publicis utilitatibus exhiberent" ("so that they might perform the necessary work of public 'utilities'," or useful public works).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]],'' 50. 6. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Every kind of trade and business throughout the Empire seems to have had its ''collegium,'' as is shown by the inscriptions collected in the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'' from any Roman municipal town. These inscriptions provide important evidence for the life and work of the lower orders of the ''municipales''. The primary object was no doubt still to protect the trade, but as time went on they tended to become associations for feasting and enjoyment, and more and more to depend on the munificence of [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patrons]] elected with the object of eliciting it.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller information about them will be found in [[Marie-Louis-Antoine-Gaston Boissier|G Boissier]], ''La Religion romaine d'Auguste aux Antonins,'' ii. 286 foll., and S Dill, ''Roman Society from Nero to Marcus Aurelius,'' pp. 264 foll.&lt;/ref&gt; How far they formed a basis or example for the guilds of the early Middle Ages is a difficult question  (see [[Guild]]). Eventually, the trade associations supported the individual, lost as he was in the vast desert of the empire, some little society and enjoyment in life, and the certainty of [[Roman funerals and burial|funeral rites]] and a permanent memorial after death.

==Religious associations==
{{Priesthoods of ancient Rome}}
Associations formed for the maintenance of religious cults were usually called ''sodalitates,'' though the word ''collegium'' was also used for them, as in the case of the college of the [[Fratres Arvales|Arval Brothers]]. Of the ancient ''[[Titii|Sodales Titii]]'' nothing is known until they were revived by [[Augustus]]; it may have been that when a ''[[gens]]'' or family charged with the maintenance of a particular cult had died out, its place was supplied by a ''sodalitas''.&lt;ref&gt;Marquardt, ''Staatsverwaltung,'' iii. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of new cults also led to the institution of new associations. In 495 BC when the worship of Minerva was introduced, a ''collegium mercatorum'' was founded to maintain it, which held its feast on the ''dies natalis'' (dedication day) of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Livy ii. 27. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 387 the ''[[ludi Capitolini]]'' were placed under the care of a similar association of dwellers on the [[Capitoline Hill]]. In 204 BC when the ''Magna Mater'' (Great Mother, or [[Cybele]]) was introduced from [[Pessinus]], a ''sodalitas'' was instituted which, as Cicero notes,&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''[[De Senectute]]'' 3. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; used to feast together during the ''[[Megalesia|ludi Megalenses]].''

All such associations were duly licensed by the state, which at all times was vigilant in forbidding the maintenance of any which it deemed dangerous for religious or political reasons. In 186 BC the senate, by a decree of which part is preserved.,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' i. 43&lt;/ref&gt; made all combination for promoting the [[Dionysus|Bacchic]] religious rites strictly illegal. Legal ''sodalitates'' are frequent later; the temple of Venus Genetrix, begun by [[Julius Caesar]] and finished by Augustus, had its ''collegium''.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''N.H.'' ii. 93&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sodalilates'' were instituted for the cult of the deified emperors such as Augustus (see [[Augustales]]) and [[Claudius]].

==Burial associations==
{{Main article|Burial society}}
Securing a proper burial was one motive for a working class person to belong to a trade guild. In the year 133 under [[Hadrian]], the formation of ''collegia'' specifically for this purpose was recognized by law, preserved at the head of the regulations of a ''collegium'' instituted for the worship of [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]] and [[Antinous]] at [[Lanuvium]].&lt;ref&gt;"Qui stipem menstruam conferre volent in funera, in Id collegium coëant, neque sub specie ejus collegii nisi semel in mense coeant conferendi - causa unde defuncti sepeliantur": ''CIL'' xiv. 2112.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]]'' (47. 22), this was a general law allowing the founding of funerary associations, as long as the law against illicit ''collegia'' was complied with. The inscription of Lanuvium, together with many others, indicates that heir members were as a rule of the humblest classes of society, and often included [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]]. Each member paid an entrance fee and a monthly subscription, and a funeral grant was made to his heir upon death in order to bury him in the burying-place of the college, or if they were too poor to construct one of their own, to secure burial in a public [[columbarium]].

These colleges were organized along the same lines as the municipal towns of the empire. Their officers were elected, usually for a year, or in the case of honorary distinctions, for life. As in a municipal town, they held titles such as ''quinquennales, curatores,'' and ''[[praefectus|praefecti]].'' [[Quaestor]]s superintended the finances of the association. Their place of meeting, if they were rich enough to have one, was called ''[[schola]]'' and was like a clubhouse. The site or the building was often given them by some rich patron, who was pleased to see his name engraved over its doorway.

The ''patroni'' increased in number, and more and more the colleges acquired the habit of depending on their benefactions. The inscriptions provide no evidence of whether the ''collegia'' also provided assistance to sick or infirm members. The only exceptions seem to be the military ''collegia'', which, though strictly forbidden as dangerous to discipline, continued to increase in number in spite of the law. Inscriptions from the great [[Roman legion|legionary]] [[castra|camps]] of the [[Roman province]] of [[Africa Province|Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;Cagnat, ''L'Armée romaine,'' 457 foll.&lt;/ref&gt; show not only the existence of these clubs, but the way in which their funds were spent. It appears that they were applied to useful purposes in the life of a member as well as for his burial, e.g. to traveling expenses, or to his support after his discharge.&lt;ref&gt;see especially ''CIL'' viii. 2552 foll.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
As the Roman Empire became gradually impoverished and depopulated, and as the difficulty of defending its frontiers increased, these associations must have been slowly extinguished. The sudden invasion of [[Dacia]] by barbarians in AD 166 was followed by the extinction of one ''collegium'' which has left a record of the fact, and probably by many others. The master of the college of Jupiter Cernenius, with the two quaestors and seven witnesses, attest the fact that the college has ceased to exist: "The accounts have been wound up, and no balance is left in the chest. For a long time no member has attended on the days fixed for meetings, and no subscriptions have been paid.&lt;ref&gt;Dill, op. cit. p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blanchard's transsexualism typology''', also '''Blanchard autogynephilia theory''' and '''Blanchard's taxonomy''', is a [[psychological typology]] of male-to-female (MtF) [[transsexualism]] created by [[Ray Blanchard]] through the 1980s and 1990s, building on the work of his colleague, [[Kurt Freund]].  Blanchard divided [[trans women]] into two different groups: "[[homosexual transsexual]]s", who Blanchard says seek [[sex reassignment surgery]] because they are feminine in both behavior and appearance, and to romantically and sexually attract (ideally heterosexual) men, and "autogynephilic transsexuals" who purportedly are sexually aroused at the idea of having a female body. Blanchard's model is unusual in that neither groups are considered "false transsexuals"; both autogynephilic and homosexual transsexuals are thought to benefit from transition. This distinction is a recurring theme in scholarly literature on transsexualism.&lt;ref name="Bancroft2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bancroft J|title=Human sexuality and its problems|pages =[https://books.google.com/books?id=bI–Jau14aLAC&amp;pg=PA290 290–1]| year = 2009 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] |isbn=978-0-443-05161-6 | chapter = Transgender gender nonconformity and transvestism | authorlink = John Bancroft (sexologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the theory include sexual behavior scientists [[J. Michael Bailey]], [[James Cantor]], [[Alice Dreger]], and some openly transgender health care providers, [[Anne Lawrence]] and Maxine Peterson, and others who say that there are significant differences between the two proposed groups, including sexuality, age of transition, ethnicity, IQ, fetishism, and quality of adjustment. Criticism of the research and theory has come from trans activists, including developmental biology researcher [[Julia Serano]], Jaimie Veale, Larry Nuttbrock, and some physicians, including Charles Allen Moser and [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]], and others who say that the theory is poorly representative of trans women.&lt;ref name="serano" /&gt;

In the [[transgender]] community, the theory has been the subject of controversy, which peaked with the publication of Bailey's ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'' in 2003.

== History ==
The early history of the study of transsexualism is sparse; however, the concept of a categorization of transsexual people can be seen as early as 1923 with the work of [[Magnus Hirschfeld]].&lt;ref name="hirschfeld1923"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hirschfeld | first = M | authorlink =  Magnus Hirschfeld | year = 1923 | title = Die intersexuelle Konstitution | journal = Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen | pages = 3–27 | volume = 23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1966, [[Harry Benjamin]] wrote that researchers of his day thought that attraction to men, while feeling that oneself is a woman, was the factor that distinguished a transvestite from a transsexual.&lt;ref name="benjamin1966"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Benjamin H | authorlink = Harry Benjamin | year = 1966 | url = http://www.mut23.de/texte/Harry%20Benjamin%20-%20The%20Transsexual%20Phenomenon.pdf | format = PDF | title = The Transsexual Phenomenon | publisher = The Julian Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1980 in the DSM-III, a  new diagnosis was introduced, that of "302.5 Transsexualism" under "Other Psychosexual Disorders". This was an attempt to provide a diagnostic category for [[gender identity disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lothstein|first= Leslie Martin |title=Female-to-male transsexualism|publisher=Routledge |year=1983|page=60|isbn=0-7100-9476-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5HI9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=transsexual+%2B+DSM+III|access-date=2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnostic category, ''transsexualism'', was for [[gender dysphoria|gender dysphoric]] individuals who demonstrated at least two years of continuous interest in transforming their physical and social gender status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Walter |last=Meyer |author2=Walter O. Bockting |author3=Peggy Cohen-Kettenis |title=The Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association's Standards Of Care For Gender Identity Disorders, Sixth Version |version=6th |publisher=Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association |date=February 2001 |url=http://www.wpath.org/Documents2/socv6.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=2009-04-22 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610012909/http://www.wpath.org/Documents2/socv6.pdf |archive-date=2007-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subtypes were asexual, homosexual (same "biological sex"), heterosexual (other "biological sex") and unspecified.&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt;  This was removed in the DSM-IV, in which gender identity disorder replaced transsexualism. Previous taxonomies, or systems of categorization, used the terms ''classic transsexual'' or ''true transsexual'', terms once used in [[differential diagnosis|differential diagnoses]].&lt;ref name="benjamin1966"/&gt;

The clinical literature of Freund, Blanchard, and others has consistently divided male-to-female transsexuals into two distinct groups - "homosexual transsexuals," people who are sexually attracted to (ideally heterosexual) men and supposedly desire a normative female body to attract them, and "heterosexual fetishistic transvestites" in which the transsexual purportedly finds the idea of having a normative female body sexually arousing but desires a heterosexual female partner.&lt;ref name="Bancroft2009" /&gt;  Kurt Freund first distinguished between these two proposed types in a 1982 research article, theorizing that the "homosexual" transsexuals were qualitatively different from the so-called "heterosexual males" with gender dysphoria.&lt;ref name="freund1982"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Freund K, Steiner BW, Chan S|date=February 1982|title=Two types of cross-gender identity|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=11|issue=1|pages=49–63|doi=10.1007/BF01541365|pmid=7073469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexologist [[Ray Blanchard]] coined the term "autogynephilia" in 1989 to describe this latter category of people.&lt;ref name="Bancroft2009" /&gt;  He stated that while they lacked a specific term to describe the concept, there was evidence for the concept among clinicians of the early 20th century.  [[Havelock Ellis]] used the terms ''eonism'' and ''sexo-aesthetic inversion'' in 1913 to describe similar cross-gender feelings and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Blanchard2005"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R|date=August 2005|title=Early history of the concept of autogynephilia|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=34|issue=4|pages=439–46|doi=10.1007/s10508-005-4343-8|pmid=16010466}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 article on the concept by Ray Blanchard noted that [[Kurt Freund|Freund]] was probably the first author to distinguish between the erotic arousal due to dressing as a woman ([[transvestism]]) versus erotic arousal due to physically transforming into a more typically female form (autogynephilia).&lt;ref name="Blanchard2005" /&gt;

=== Development ===
Blanchard's observations at the Clarke Institute began by categorizing male-to-female transsexuals into four groups based off their supposed sexual orientations: "homosexual," "heterosexual," bisexual, and [[analloerotic]]s (i.e. trans women attracted to men, women, both, or neither, respectively.)&lt;ref name="Blanchard1985"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R|date=June 1985|title=Typology of male-to-female transsexualism|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=14|issue=3|pages=247–61|doi=10.1007/bf01542107|pmid=4004548}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchard1989"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R|date=October 1989|title=The concept of autogynephilia and the typology of male gender dysphoria|journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|volume=177|issue=10|pages=616–23|doi=10.1097/00005053-198910000-00004|pmid=2794988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanchard then conducted a series of studies on people [[assigned male at birth]] with gender dysphoria, including male-to-female transsexual people, and concluded that there existed only two distinct types.&lt;ref name="Blanchard1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchard1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchardetal1987"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R, Clemmensen LH, Steiner BW|date=April 1987|title=Heterosexual and homosexual gender dysphoria|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=16|issue=2|pages=139–52|doi=10.1007/BF01542067|pmid=3592961}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blanchard said that one type of gender dysphoria/transsexualism manifests itself in individuals who are exclusively attracted to men (Homosexual transsexuals averaged a [[Kinsey scale]] measurement of 5-6  and six is the maximum, or a 9.86±2.37 on the [[Modified Androphilia Scale]]&lt;ref name="lawrence2005"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lawrence AA, Latty EM, Chivers ML, Bailey JM|date=April 2005|title=Measurement of sexual arousal in postoperative male-to-female transsexuals using vaginal photoplethysmography|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~sexlab/files/pubs/Lawrenceetal2005.pdf|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=34|issue=2|pages=135–45|doi=10.1007/s10508-005-1792-z|pmid=15803248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leavitt1990"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Leavitt F, Berger JC|date=October 1990|title=Clinical patterns among male transsexual candidates with erotic interest in males|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=19|issue=5|pages=491–505|doi=10.1007/BF02442350|pmid=2260914}}&lt;/ref&gt;), whom he referred to as ''homosexual transsexuals'', adopting Freund's terminology.&lt;ref name="Blanchardetal1987" /&gt; The other type he defined as including those who are attracted to females (gynephilic), attracted to both males and females (bisexual), and attracted to neither males nor females (''analloerotic'' or asexual); Blanchard referred to this latter set collectively as the ''non-homosexual transsexuals''.&lt;ref name="Blanchard1989class"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R|date=August 1989|title=The classification and labeling of nonhomosexual gender dysphorias|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=18|issue=4|pages=315–34|doi=10.1007/BF01541951|pmid=2673136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchard1988"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R|date=January 1988|title=Nonhomosexual gender dysphoria|journal=Journal of Sex Research|volume=24|issue=1|pages=188–93|doi=10.1080/00224498809551410|pmid=22375647}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanchard says that the "non-homosexual" transsexuals (but not the "homosexual" transsexuals) exhibit ''autogynephilia'',&lt;ref name="Blanchardetal1987" /&gt; which he defined as a [[paraphilia|paraphilic]] interest in having female anatomy.&lt;ref name="Blanchard1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchard1991"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R|year=1991|title=Clinical observations and systematic studies of autogynephilia|journal=Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy|volume=17|issue=4|pages=235–51|doi=10.1080/00926239108404348|pmc=|pmid=1815090}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bailey2003"&gt;Bailey, J. M. (2003). ''The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender-Bending and Transsexualism.'' Joseph Henry Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodkin, Dennis (Dec. 12, 2003).

Studies usually find that some number of non-homosexual transsexual report having no autogynephilia.&lt;ref name="serano" /&gt; When developing the typology, Blanchard found that gynephilic gender identity patients who reported never experiencing arousal to crossdressing were still measurably aroused by autogynephilic stimuli, and that autogynephilia among non-androphilic trans women was negatively associated with tendency to color their narrative to be more socially acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Men Trapped in Men's Bodies|last=Lawrence|first=Anne|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led Blanchard to conclude that non-homosexual trans women who reported no autogynephilic interests were misrepresenting their stories. This conclusion has been criticized for being [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]]&lt;ref name="serano" /&gt; and for being based on an incorrect way of measuring autogynephilia.&lt;ref name="moser2010" /&gt;

== Terminology ==
Within the typology, sexual orientation terms are usually used relative to biological sex. That is, "homosexual" refers to those attracted exclusively to men, while "non-homosexual" refers to those who are attracted to other people than men or who are attracted to neither men nor women. "Homosexual" is used this way partly because of the scientific precedent. One of the types of transsexuals described within the theory is known as homosexual transsexuals. They are thought to be fundamentally the same phenomenon as the most feminine gay men. This similarity between homosexual transsexuals and homosexual men is also part of the reason why "homosexual" is used relative to biological sex.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The word "autogynephilia" refers to a propensity to be sexually aroused by the thought or image of one self as a woman. This paraphilia is related to [[transvestic fetishism]].

== Theory ==
The typology divides male-to-female transsexuals into two groups: homosexual and autogynephilic. Homosexual transsexuals are thought of as being extremely feminine gay men, while autogynephilic transsexuals are thought to be sexually attracted to the image of themselves as women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Attraction to the image of oneself as a woman is called ''autogynephilia''. The homosexual type corresponds to what is known as early-onset in other sources, while the autogynephilic type corresponds to what is known as late-onset in other sources. Homosexual transsexuals are proposed to be motivated by being very feminine in both behavior and appearance, and by a desire to romantically and sexually attract (ideally very masculine) men. Autogynephilic transsexuals are thought to be motivated by their sexual desire and romantic love for being women.&lt;ref name="LawrenceBecoming" /&gt;

Homosexual transsexuals are very feminine from a young age. According to Bailey and Zucker, non-transgender gay men are also often very feminine when young, but usually learn to live in a more masculine role when they grow up. They argue that homosexual transsexuals differ because they encounter early adversity that prevented them from defeminizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Man Who Would Be Queen|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=178-179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gay men find the femininity of homosexual transsexuals very unattractive,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Man Who Would Be Queen|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=76-79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the homosexual transsexuals themselves are very attracted to masculinity that they have trouble finding in gay men. As a result, homosexual transsexuals may be partially motivated by a desire to attract straight men.

Autogynephiles have sexual fantasies about being women. These fantasies may focus on a variety of things associated with womanhood, such as anatomy, clothing or behavior. Blanchard found that the specific form the autogynephilia takes on correlates with the likelihood of transition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Erotic target location errors ===
{{See also|Erotic target location error|Furry fandom|Paraphilic infantilism}}
Ray Blanchard conjectured that autogynephilia is a misdirected form of heterosexuality, with the attraction to women being redirected towards the self instead of others. These forms of erotic target location errors have also been observed with other base orientations than gynephilia, such as pedophilia, [[acrotomophilia]] and attraction to plush animals. Anne Lawrence argued that these phenomena provide further support for autogynephilia theory:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe that the existence of these analogs of autogynephilic transsexualism calls into question the most influential biological and psychoanalytic theories of nonhomosexual MtF transsexualism, because such theories should also be able to account for these analogous phenomena but cannot easily do so. For example: It is plausible that hormonal abnormalities during prenatal development could result in a male-bodied person with a brain that had developed in a female-typical direction. It is less plausible that a prenatal developmental disturbance could result in a male-bodied person with a brain that had developed like that of an amputee or a plush animal. [...]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I consider it more parsimonious to theorize that autogynephilic MtF transsexualism and the analogous conditions that exist in men who are sexually attracted to children, amputees, plush animals, and perhaps real animals, all represent manifestations of an unusual type of paraphilia in which affected men feel sexually aroused by the idea of impersonating or becoming whatever category of person or thing they find sexually attractive. Their paraphilic desires, in turn, often give rise to strongly held, highly valued alternative identities that ultimately become their dominant identities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Autopedophiles have been found to be more likely than other pedophiles to have considered whether they would be better off as a child, and more likely to have considered hormones or surgery to look more like a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hsu KJ, Bailey JM | title = Autopedophilia | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 115–123 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27899472 | doi = 10.1177/0956797616677082 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Autogynephilic vs. homosexual transsexuals ===
By definition, autogynephilic transsexuals are autogynephilic while homosexual transsexuals are androphilic. However, a number of other differences between the types have been found. Under the theory, homosexual transsexuals are predicted to begin transitioning earlier in life,&lt;ref name="onesixtytwo"&gt;''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; generally before turning 30, which accounts for their supposedly better adjustment. They are also more likely to come from poorer, non-white or immigrant backgrounds,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', p. 179, 183-184.&lt;/ref&gt; have lower IQs,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as be by definition exclusively attracted to men.

Anne Lawrence has proposed that autogynephilic transsexuals are more excited about [[Sex reassignment surgery|sexual reassignment surgery]] than homosexual transsexuals. She finds that homosexual transsexuals are typically ambivalent or indifferent about SRS, while autogynephilic transsexuals want to have surgery as quickly as possible, are happy to be rid of their penis, and proud of their new genitals.&lt;ref name="LawrenceBecoming" /&gt; Michael Bailey argued that homosexual transsexuals are unlikely to transition if their appearance as women would be very unattractive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Man Who Would Be Queen|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autogynephilia is most notable for its use in Blanchard's taxonomy to explain the presence of [[gender dysphoria]] in "non-homosexual" ([[gynephilia|gynephilic]]) [[male-to-female transsexual]]s, in contrast to the  gender dysphoria observed in "homosexual" ([[androphilia|androphilic]]) transsexuals.  Autogynephilia has also been suggested to pertain to romantic love as well as to sexual arousal patterns.&lt;ref name="LawrenceBecoming"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lawrence AA | title = Becoming what we love: autogynephilic transsexualism conceptualized as an expression of romantic love | journal = Perspectives in Biology and Medicine | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 506–20 | date = 2007-10-24 | pmid = 17951885 | doi = 10.1353/pbm.2007.0050 | url = http://www.annelawrence.com/becoming_what_we_love.pdf | publisher = Elsevier | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blanchard provides specific case examples to illustrate the autogynephilic sexual fantasies that people reported:&lt;ref name = Blanchard2005/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Philip was a 38-year-old professional man referred to the author's clinic for assessment....Philip began masturbating at puberty, which occurred at age 12 or 13. The earliest sexual fantasy he could recall was that of having a woman's body. When he masturbated, he would imagine that he was a nude woman lying alone in her bed. His mental imagery would focus on his breasts, his vagina, the softness of his skin, and so on—all the characteristic features of the female physique. This remained his favorite sexual fantasy throughout his life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Sexuality ===
According to Blanchard, "An autogynephile does not necessarily become sexually aroused every time he pictures himself as female or engages in feminine behavior, any more than a heterosexual man automatically gets an erection whenever he sees an attractive woman. Thus, the concept of autogynephilia—like that of heterosexuality, homosexuality, or pedophilia—refers to a ''potential'' for sexual excitation"&lt;ref name="Blanchard1991" /&gt; [emphasis in original].

Blanchard classified four subtypes of autogynephilic sexual fantasies, but noted that "All four types of autogynephilia tend to occur in combination with other types rather than alone."&lt;ref name="Blanchard1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name="blanchard1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blanchard R | title = Varieties of autogynephilia and their relationship to gender dysphoria | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–51 | date = June 1993 | pmid = 8494491 | doi = 10.1007/bf01541769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Transvestic autogynephilia: arousal to the act or fantasy of wearing typically feminine clothing
*Behavioral autogynephilia: arousal to the act or fantasy of doing something regarded as feminine
*Physiologic autogynephilia: arousal to fantasies of body functions specific to people regarded as female
*Anatomic autogynephilia: arousal to the fantasy of having a normative woman's body, or parts of one

Other authors have distinguished between behavioral autogynephilia and interpersonal gynephilia, with the latter being arousal to being seen or admired as a woman or having sex with men.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hsu KJ, Rosenthal AM, Bailey JM | title = The Psychometric Structure of Items Assessing Autogynephilia | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 44 | issue = 5 | pages = 1301–12 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25277693 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-014-0397-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There also exist male assigned at birth people who report being sexually aroused by the image or idea of having ''some'' but not ''all'' normative female anatomy, such as having breasts but retaining their penis and testicles; Blanchard referred to this phenomenon as ''partial autogynephilia.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blanchard R | title = The she-male phenomenon and the concept of partial autogynephilia | journal = Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–76 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8468711 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1080/00926239308404889 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blanchard R | title = Partial versus complete autogynephilia and gender dysphoria | journal = Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 301–7 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8308916 | doi = 10.1080/00926239308404373 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autogynephilia has been linked to [[Gynandromorphophilia|attraction to transgender women]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hsu KJ, Rosenthal AM, Miller DI, Bailey JM | title = Sexual Arousal Patterns of Autogynephilic Male Cross-Dressers | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 247–253 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27620319 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-016-0826-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Autogynephilic men are usually attracted to women and not to men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It has been proposed that autogynephiles who report being attracted to men are instead experiencing pseudo-bisexuality or pseudo-androphilia, an interpersonal autogynephilic desire for men as part of the fantasy about being a woman.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===DSM-5===
In [[DSM-5]], published in 2013, ''With autogynephilia'' (sexual arousal by thoughts, images of self as a female) is a specifier to '''302.3 [[Transvestic disorder]]''' (intense sexual arousal from cross-dressing fantasies, urges or behaviors); the other specifier is  ''With [[fetishism]]'' (sexual arousal to fabrics, materials or garments).&lt;ref name="DSM-5-paraphillic"&gt;{{Cite book | last= American Psychiatric Association | year= 2013 | title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders | edition=Fifth | publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing | location=Arlington, VA | pages=685–705 | isbn= 978-0-89042-555-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender dysphoria ===
{{See also|Causes of transsexuality}}
Blanchard found that anatomic autogynephilia was more associated with gender dysphoria than transvestic autogynephilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blanchard R | title = Varieties of autogynephilia and their relationship to gender dysphoria | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–51 | date = June 1993 | pmid = 8494491 | doi = 10.1007/bf01541769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Men Trapped in Men's Bodies: Narratives of Autogynephilic Transsexualism|last=Lawrence|first=Anne|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4614-5181-5|location=|pages=22-23, 24-26, 140-142, 155-156}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different pattern was found in a sample of non-transgender autogynephilic men, where higher degrees of anatomic autogynephilia were associated with less gender dysphoria; here, it was instead interpersonal and physiological autogynephilia that predicted gender dysphoria. The men in this sample were significantly more gender dysphoric than the non-transgender male baseline.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Autogynephilia in cisgender women ===
Two studies have tested the possibility that cisgender women can also experience autogynephilia. Veale and colleagues (2008) found that an online sample of cisgender women commonly endorsed items on adapted versions of Blanchard's autogynephilia scales.&lt;ref name="veale2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Veale JF, Clarke DE, Lomax TC | title = Sexuality of male-to-female transsexuals | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 586–97 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18299976 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-007-9306-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moser (2009) created an ''Autogynephilia Scale for Women'' based on items used to categorize MtF transsexuals as autogynephilic in other studies. A questionnaire that included the ASW was distributed to a sample of 51 professional women employed at an urban hospital; 29 completed questionnaires were returned for analysis. By the common definition of ever having erotic arousal to the thought or image of oneself as a woman, 93% of the respondents would be classified as autogynephilic. Using a more rigorous definition of "frequent" arousal to multiple items, 28% would be classified as autogynephilic.&lt;ref name="pmid19591032" /&gt; However, Anne Lawrence criticized these studies' methodology and conclusions and asserted that genuine autogynephilia occurs very rarely, if ever, in natal women.&lt;ref name="pmid20069491"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lawrence AA | title = Something resembling autogynephilia in women: comment on Moser (2009) | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20069491 | doi = 10.1080/00918360903445749 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Her comment was rebutted by Moser who said that she had made multiple errors by comparing the wrong items.&lt;ref name="PMID20582797"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moser C | title = A rejoinder to Lawrence (2010): it helps if you compare the correct items. | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 57 | issue = 6 | pages = 693–696 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20582797| doi = 10.1080/00918369.2010.485859 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One case of anatomic autoandrophilia has been reported in an adult male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lawrence AA | title = Anatomic autoandrophilia in an adult male | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 1050–6 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19093196 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9446-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The concept received attention when sex researcher and trans woman [[Anne Lawrence]] described it on her website in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="lawrence1998"&gt;{{cite web | last = Lawrence | first = AA | url = http://home.swipnet.se/~w-13968/autogynephilia.html | title = Men Trapped in Men's Bodies:An Introduction to the Concept of Autogynephilia | date = 1998-10-01 | access-date = 2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003, when Bailey published ''The Man Who Would Be Queen'', in which he based his portrayal of male-to-female transsexual people on Blanchard's taxonomy, an enormous controversy resulted.&lt;ref name="Dreger2008" /&gt;

Jaimie Veale gathered a convenience sample over the Internet of trans women's impressions of and opinions on Blanchard's typology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Veale J, Clark DE, Lomax TC  |date=2012|title=Male-to-female transsexuals’ impressions of Blanchard’s autogynephilia theory | journal = International Journal of Transgenderism |volume=13|issue=3|pages=131–139|doi=10.1080/15532739.2011.669659 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the people answering the survey, 52.5% had a negative response.  Of the 170 respondents, 33 said the typology was too narrow and restrictive, 15 said it did not apply to their experiences, and 5 that the typology was driven by questionable motives such as "to encourage 'elitist divisionism'."  Other participants, however, said they did, in fact, experience autogynephilia.

Criticism of the theory of "homosexual transsexuals" is generally focused in two categories: the use of the terms "homosexual" and "non-homosexual" to refer to MtF transsexuals by their assigned sex&lt;ref name="bagemihl"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bagemihl | first = B | chapter = Surrogate phonology and transsexual faggotry: A linguistic analogy for uncoupling sexual orientation from gender identity | title = Queerly Phrased: Language, Gender, and Sexuality | editors = Livia A; Hall K : | page = 380 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn = 0-19-510471-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Benjamin"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Benjamin |first=Harry |title=The Transsexual Phenomenon |location=Chapter 2, Paragraph 16 |url=http://www.symposion.com/ijt/benjamin/chap_02.htm#Relationship%20to%20homosexuality |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913065950/http://www.symposion.com/ijt/benjamin/chap_02.htm |archive-date=September 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the data underlying the theory itself.&lt;ref name="pmid19591032"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moser C | title = Autogynephilia in women | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 56 | issue = 5 | pages = 539–47 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19591032 | doi = 10.1080/00918360903005212 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="veale2008" /&gt; Harry Benjamin, in his seminal work ''The Transsexual Phenomenon'', opined that the question "is a transsexual homosexual?" had both "yes" and "no" answers depending on whether sexual anatomy or [[gender identity]] was prioritised, and in cases of post-operative male-to-female transsexuals, describing them as "homosexual men" was against "common sense and reason".&lt;ref name="Benjamin" /&gt; The terminology has also been described as confusing and controversial among transsexuals seeking sexual reassignment,&lt;ref name="leavitt1990" /&gt; archaic,&lt;ref name="wahng"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wahng | first = SJ | year = 2004 | chapter = Transmasculinity and Asian American Gendering | editors = Aldama AJ | title =Violence and the Body: Race, Gender, and the State | publisher = [[Indiana University Press]] | isbn = 0-253-34171-X | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=aCH6zsDB5mkC&amp;pg=PA292#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 292]; [https://books.google.com/books?id=aCH6zsDB5mkC&amp;pg=PA307#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 307n8] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and demeaning.&lt;ref name="leiblum2000"&gt;{{cite book | last = Leiblum | first = SR |author2=Rosen RC | year = 2000 | title = Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy | edition = 3rd | isbn = 1-57230-574-6 | publisher = [[Guilford Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 sexologist [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]] expressed regret for having used this terminology, which was standard when he used it, to refer to transsexual women, and that he now tries to use words more sensitively.&lt;ref name="Bancroftcomment"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bancroft J | title = Lust or identity? | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 426–8; discussion 505-10 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18431640 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9317-1 | publisher = Springer | authorlink = John Bancroft (sexologist) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Moser, a sexuality advocate, criticized Blanchard's theory, stating that it uses an overly-broad definition of autogynephilia, is not sufficiently relevant to MtF transsexual patients, fails to account for all information on sexual and romantic interests of homosexual and transsexual people, and lacks supporting data.&lt;ref name="moser2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moser C | title = Blanchard's Autogynephilia Theory: a critique | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 57 | issue = 6 | pages = 790–809 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20582803 | doi = 10.1080/00918369.2010.486241 | edition = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaimie Veale, a psychology academic, published an alternative theory in 2010 which proposes that variances in gender identity are driven by personality and social factors which determine whether psychological [[defense mechanism]]s are employed to avoid or repress gender nonconformity, resulting in the later expression of this gender nonconformity.&lt;ref name="veale2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Veale JF, Lomax T, Clarke D | doi = 10.1080/15532739.2010.514217 | title = Identity-Defense Model of Gender-Variant Development | journal = International Journal of Transgenderism | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 125–138 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julia Serano]], a trans activist, wrote that there were flaws in Blanchard's original papers, including that they were conducted among overlapping populations primarily at the [[Clarke Institute]] in [[Toronto]] without nontranssexual controls, that the subtypes were not empirically derived but instead were "[[begging the question]] that transsexuals fall into subtypes based on their sexual orientation," and that further research had found a non-deterministic correlation between cross-gender arousal and sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="serano"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Serano | first1 = J.

T. M. Bettcher, based on her own experience as a trans woman, has critiqued the notion of "autogynephilia," and "target errors" generally, within a framework of "erotic structuralism," arguing that the notion conflates essential distinctions between "source of attraction" and "erotic content," and "(erotic) interest" and "(erotic) attraction," thus misinterpreting what she prefers to call, following Serano, "female embodiment eroticism." She maintains that not only is "an erotic interest in oneself as a gendered being," as she puts it, a non-pathological and indeed necessary component of regular sexual attraction to others, but within the framework of erotic structuralism, a "misdirected" attraction to oneself as postulated by Blanchard is outright nonsensical.&lt;ref name="Bettcher2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bettcher TM | title = When selves have sex: what the phenomenology of trans sexuality can teach about sexual orientation | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 61 | issue = 5 | pages = 605–20 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24295078 | doi = 10.1080/00918369.2014.865472 | url = https://www.academia.edu/5300966/When_Selves_Have_Sex_What_The_Phenomenology_of_Trans_Sexuality_Can_Teach_About_Sexual_Orientation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Misgendering language ===
According to Leavitt and Berger (1990), "Transsexuals, as a group, vehemently oppose the [[homosexual transsexual]] label and its pejorative baggage (Morgan, 1978).  As a rule, they are highly invested in a heterosexual life-style and are repulsed by notions of homosexual relations with males. Attention from males often serves to validate their feminine status."&lt;ref name="leavitt1990" /&gt;

Trans man [[Aaron Devor]] wrote, "If what we really mean to say is attracted to males, then say 'attracted to males' or androphilic... I see absolutely no reason to continue with language that people find offensive when there is perfectly serviceable, in fact better, language that is not offensive."&lt;ref name="lane2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lane R | title = Truth, lies, and trans science | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 453–6; discussion 505-10 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18431622 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9336-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still other transsexual people are opposed to any and all models of diagnosis which allow medical professionals to prevent anyone from changing their sex, and seek their removal from the DSM.&lt;ref name="shefer"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Gender of Psychology|last=Shefer|first=Tamara|last2=Boonzaier|first2=Floretta | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Juta and Company Limited|year=2006|isbn=978-1-919713-92-2|edition=Illustrated|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jtiUvdDlTboC&amp;pg=PA273#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 273–4]; [https://books.google.com/books?id=jtiUvdDlTboC&amp;pg=PA273#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 282]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accusations of misconduct ===
Trans activist [[Lynn Conway]] blogged extensively about the publication of Bailey's book by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] and along with other activists accused Bailey of misconduct. [[Northwestern University]] investigated Bailey, but did not reveal the findings of that investigation and did not comment on whether or not Bailey had been punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wilson | first = R | url = http://chronicle.com/article/Northwestern-U-Concludes/103078/ | title = Northwestern U.

The accusations themselves did not hold up to scrutiny, according to Dreger's analysis.  For example, two of the four transsexual women who accused Bailey of misusing their stories in the book were not actually mentioned in the book at all.&lt;ref name=Dreger2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dreger AD | title = The controversy surrounding "The man who would be queen": a case history of the politics of science, identity, and sex in the Internet age | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 366–421 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18431641 | pmc = 3170124 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-007-9301-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dreger studied the reactions of trans activists and other controversies in her 2015 book ''[[Galileo's Middle Finger]]''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2015"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dreger | first = Alice Domurat | title = Galileo's middle finger: heretics, activists, and the search for justice in science | publisher = Penguin Press | location = New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781594206085 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She argued that although the science appears correct that eroticism is behind the typology of transgenderism, activists in the trans community preferred the simpler narrative of literally being one sex trapped in the body of the other.  Dreger says, "Autogynephilia is perhaps best understood as a love that would really rather we didn’t speak its name",&lt;ref name="autogenerated2015"/&gt; in reference to the famous expression ''[[the love that dare not speak its name]]'' formerly used to refer to homosexuality or [[pederasty]].

The '''CBI''' film series is a series of four [[Malayalam films]] directed by K. Madhu and written by [[S. N. Swami]] featuring [[Mammootty]] as [[Sethurama Iyer]], a [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI) officer. The series started off in 1988 with the block buster ''[[Oru CBI Diary Kurippu]]''.

The films depicts a team of three CBI officers led by [[Sethurama Iyer]] investigating into a murder case. All the films feature [[Mammootty]] as [[Sethurama Iyer]]. The other two members of the team vary in the series. All the four films so far released have  ''Vikram'', the character played by [[Jagathy Sreekumar]] as a CBI officer. But he is not part of the three-men team in the third film but appears in the film for a short length. Chacko played by Mukesh appears in the first film but is not part of the team. But Chacko becomes part of the team from the second film onwards.

The lead character, Sethurama Iyer is said to have been inspired by a police officer named Radhavinod Raju, who in 2009 was appointed as the first chief of India's [[National Investigation Agency (India)|National Investigation Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/thiruvananthapuram/NIA-chief-inspired-hit-film-20-yrs-ago/Article1-368114.aspx|title=NIA chief inspired hit film 20 yrs ago|publisher=Hindusthan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl1503/15030120.htm|title=A crack investigative team|publisher=hindu|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of the 5th movie of the series titled '''"Black Investigators"''' is under progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cinequeen.com/commonnewsdetail.php?mid=0&amp;cnid=90 | title=Mammootty back again as Sethurama Iyer | publisher=CineQueen.com | accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://2filmfanscity.blogspot.in/2013/04/black-investigators-malayalam-movie.html | title=Black Investigators Malayalam Movie ( 2013 ) - MAMMOOTTY , MUKESH | publisher=2filmfanscity | date=22 April 2013 | accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The background score of the series became quite popular. Years after the release of the first two sequels, the background score became popular as mobile phone ringtone. This was one of the reasons that led the filmmakers to plan a third sequel after 15 years. All the sequels use the same background score, composed by music director [[Shyam (composer)|Shyam]].

'''Calligraffiti''' is an art form that combines [[calligraphy]], [[typography]], and [[graffiti]]. It can be classified as either [[abstract expressionism]] or abstract vandalism. It is defined as a visual art that integrates letters into compositions that attempt to communicate a broader message through writing that has been aesthetically altered to move beyond the literal meaning. Simply put, it is the conscious effort of making a word or group of words into a visual composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artcritical.com/2013/09/16/calligraffiti-at-leila-heller/|title=Calligraphy, Meet Graffiti: Calligraffiti at Leila Heller Gallery - artcritical|date=16 September 2013|website=Artcriticial.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such it is meant to be both an aesthetic experience and provocative art—mixing tradition and precision with modern unbridled self-expression.

==Definition and brief history==

[[File:Calligrafiti-assilah-morocco-2013.jpg|thumb|Wall mural, composed of Arabic letters, in a public street, Assilah, Morocco, 2013]]

The origins of the term, "calligraffiti" are unclear. The Dutch artist [[Niels Shoe Meulman]] is often incorrectly credited with coining the term in 2007, when he used it as the title of his solo exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance, Sinno, N., ''War of Colors: Beirut Street Art and the Reclamation of Public Space,'' ''ASAP/Journal,'' Vol. 2, No. 1, 2017, pp. 71-104 as an example of an art historian who credits Muelman, with coining the term and locates it as a form of street art.&lt;/ref&gt; Muelman describes calligraffiti as "traditional handwriting with a metropolitan attitude" and a "way of translating the art of the street to the interior of museums, galleries and apartments." In an interview he explains the technique itself as "directness in the whole, finesse in the details. An even balance between seeing and reading word and image. … letters, writing and language itself becomes an image or abstraction. On the other hand, basic shapes and splats become language."'&lt;ref&gt;Meulman, N. S., ''Calligraffiti: The Graphic Art of Niels Shoe Meulman,'' Urheberrechtlich geschutztes Material, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;   

Use of the term, however, predates the contributions of Niels Shoe Meulman by at least thirty years. The Canadian painter, [[Brion Gysin]] used the term in his final exhibition, ''Calligraffiti of Fire'' held at the Galerie Samy Kinge in Paris between 19 April and 19 May in 1986 and the term was also used as the title of the book which accompanied Gysin's exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Hoptman, L.J. (ed.), ''Brion Gysin: Dream Machine,'' Merrell, 2010, p. 131; Ballantyne, E., Dvořák, M. and Irvine, D. (eds). ''Translocated Modernisms: Paris and Other Lost Generations,'' University of Ottawa Press, 2016 [e-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also used in a book about post-modernism, ''Spirits Hovering Over the Ashes: Legacies of Postmodern Theory'' by [[H.L. Hix]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Hix, H.L., ''Spirits Hovering over the Ashes: Legacies of Postmodern Theory,'' State University of New York Press 1995, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordanian artist and art historian [[Wijdan Ali]] also used the term, "calligraffiti" in her book, ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' (1997) to describe a style of art that had been flourishing across the Middle East and North Africa from the mid-20th century. She defined calligraffiti as the use of  "script of ordinary writing where the work is composed of the artist's personalised handwriting within a modern composition." &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 166-67 and also cited in Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; Ali wanted to use the term because she saw this type of art as being inspired by calligraphy yet, also close to the scribbling of graffiti artists. Pioneer artists in this style include: [[Hassan Massoudy]], [[Hossein Zenderoudi]] and [[Parviz Tanavoli]]. &lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; Ali locates calligraffiti art as a distinct style within the School of Calligraphic Art (also known as the [[Hurufiyya movement]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 165-172&lt;/ref&gt; 

Calligraffiti is distinguished from other styles of calligraphic art (such as ''Pure Calligraphy, Neoclassical, Modern Classical, Freeform, Abstract calligraphy, Calligraphic Combinations and Unconscious Calligraphy)'' in that it has no rules and artists require no formal training.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas, traditional calligraphy in the Islamic world is bound by very strict rules, not the least a prohibition on using representations of the human form in manuscripts, calligraffiti artists break free from such rules and allow themselves to reshape and deconstruct letters as well as to combine them with other symbols and figures in creative ways.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraffiti artists are not confined to the use of actual letters. Instead, they go beyond a simple transformation of Arabic or English-language words into visual compositions, and invent new languages. &lt;ref&gt;Carrier, D., "Calligraphy, Meet Graffiti: Calligraffiti at Leila Heller Gallery," ''Artcritical,'' [Online art magazine], 16 December, 2013 [http://www.artcritical.com/2013/09/16/calligraffiti-at-leila-heller/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ali also makes a distinction between ''calligraffiti'' and ''pseudo-calligraffiti.''  Straight calligraffiti refers to the use of calligraphy without the rules of proportion while pseudo-calligraffiti is a total abstraction in which the letters may or may not be legible. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., "The Status of Islamic Art in the Twentieth Century," ''Muqarnas,'' vol. 9, 1992, pp 186-188 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1523143 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of calligraffiti appears to have begun in the Middle East and North Africa in around the 1950s, when local artists, searching for a visual language that expressed their national identity and heritage, began incorporating Arabic letters, as a graphic form, into their artworks.&lt;ref&gt;Issa, R., Cestar. J. and Porter,V., ''Signs of Our Times: From Calligraphy to Calligraffiti,''New York, Merrill, 2016; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/;Tuohy {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611074834/https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/# |date=2018-06-11 }}, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists such as the Lebanese painter and poet, [[Etel Adnan]] (b. 1925); the Egyptian painter, Ramzi Moustafa (b. 1926) and the Iraqi painter-sculptor and philosopher, [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]] (b.1925) all searched for ways to use Arabic letters in abstract compositions. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 167-169; it should be noted that not all art historians classify Shakir Hassan Al-Said in the list of calligraffiti artists. Nadia Shabout, for example, argues that he does not fit the definition of a calligraffiti artist because he aimed for a total deconstruction of the letter. Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p.80&lt;/ref&gt;

The incidence of calligraffiti gathered momentum during the early 21st-century when Middle Eastern street artists co-opted urban spaces for calligraffiti art designed to convey political or provocative statements. This street art practice was especially conspicuous during the wave of uprisings between 2010 and 2013, that became known as the ''Arab Spring'' thereby bringing the art form to the attention of international audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Naguib, S.A., "Engaged Ephemeral Art: Street Art and the Egyptian Arab Spring," ''Transcultural Studies,'' Vol. 2, 2016, pp 53-86&lt;/ref&gt; Certain calligraffiti artists have credited the Middle Eastern calligraphy artists as an important influence on their work. For instance, the Tunisian calligraffiti artist, [[el Seed]] points to the work of Iraqi painter, [[Hassan Massoudy]] as a major source of inspiration, noting that "The work of Hassan Massoudy was totally out of anything I’ve seen from the way he shapes the letters to the colors he uses. He completely revolutionized the art of calligraphy.” &lt;ref&gt;Saldaña, S., "Reviving Arabic Calligraphy: An Encounter with Iraqi-French artist Hassan Massoudy," ''Mosaic Stories,'' 10 March, 2017, [http://www.mosaicstories.org/2017/03/10/reviving-arabic-calligraphy-encounter-iraqi-french-artist-hassan-massoudy/ Online:}&lt;/ref&gt;



===Characteristics===
Calligraffiti is a complex process. Its specificity is in its paradoxical nature, as it is characterised by and composed of many elements that appear contradictory: 
* blending of tradition and modernity
* sharing of culture and political subversion
* beauty and provocation 
* precision and spontaneity 
* philosophical and reactionary
* literal and metaphorical
It requires an overall vision from the artist- from the message he is trying to convey, to the shape of the letters, to the larger picture he is creating. Calligraffiti artist, Tubs, explains that the art form’s graffiti component forces the artist to reflect upon and consciously create a piece that will arouse a specific feeling or reaction in the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.threadless.com/art-to-the-letter-meet-artist-tubs/|title=Art To The Letter: Meet Artist Tubs - Threadless Blog|date=17 February 2015|website=Blog.threadless.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of the alphabet as an artistic medium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artistsofutah.org/15bytes/11oct/page6.html|title=Jerry Hardesty - Toni Youngblood|first=Artists of|last=Utah|website=artistsofutah.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; demands practice, accuracy, and foresight.

===Tools===
Part of what differentiates calligraffiti from calligraphy is its freedom from rules. Calligraphy is a meticulous and specific art that takes years to master. Most calligraffiti artists, like El Seed, do not consider themselves calligraphers because they do not know, nor do they follow the many rules of calligraphy.&lt;ref name="qatartodayonline.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.qatartodayonline.com/i-am-not-a-revolutionary-artist/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-03-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509101803/http://www.qatartodayonline.com/i-am-not-a-revolutionary-artist/# |archive-date=2016-05-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraffiti on the other hand is characterized by its diversity of mediums, methods, and instruments. Each individual artist uses and sometimes designs his or her own tools.

==Calligraffiti in the Middle East and North Africa==
Arabic calligraphy is incredibly rich; it is an art form that has been perfected for well over a millennium. Islamic tradition greatly encouraged the development of calligraphy as an art form in order to assist religion began to spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenprophet.com/2012/02/arabic-calligraphy/|title=Arabic Calligraphy – eL Seed's Writing Is On the Wall|website=Greenprophet.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic writing represents the word of God revealed to Mohammed, which gives Arabic letters a special meaning. &lt;ref&gt; Bloom J. and Blair, S., ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Oxford University Press, 2009, Vol. 2, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread and evolution of calligraphy can be traced very specifically throughout Islamic history as it is inherently tied to the spread of Islam itself. Calligraphy was how scribes transcribed and created Qur'ans—allowing Mohammad's message to extend beyond the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zakariya.net/history/index.html|title=Arabic Calligraphy History - Tools, Techniques, Ahar Paper|website=Zakariya.net|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraphy has always had a central role in Middle Eastern art because of Islamic restrictions concerning the portrayal of human beings. As a result, calligraphy became not only a mechanism for the expansion of Islam, but a way to create religious art.&lt;ref name="ajammc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajammc.com/2013/09/17/word-as-image-contextualizing-calligraffiti-1984-2013-with-french-tunisian-street-artist-el-seed/|title=Word As Image: Contextualizing "Calligraffiti: 1984-2013" with French-Tunisian Street Artist eL Seed - Ajam Media Collective|date=17 September 2013|website=Ajammc.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calligraffiti: calligraphy of the 21st century===
Calligraffiti has emerged quite forcefully in the Middle East in recent years, particularly in the wake of the Arab uprisings. While graffiti has never been widespread in the region, it has spread with the rising dissidence against Middle Eastern dictatorships and authoritarian regimes. Calligraphy artist [[Hassan Massoudy]] called Arabic calligraphy and graffiti "two daughters of the same parents" because of their interrelationship. He notes thtat "Obviously [calligraphy and graffiti] both are about the use of letter and their alphabets, and their center of gravity is the beauty of writing. For both, a letter is more than just a letter and they fill them with emotions. The use of empty space and composition within this space is something else they have in common.&lt;ref&gt;Massoudy, H., "Two Daughers of the Same Parents," in: Don Stone Karl and Pascal Zoghbi, ''Arabic Calligraphy,'' From Here to Fame Publishing, 2011, pp 31-35&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraffiti is a logical evolution of the two art forms coexisting in the same space.

The first step towards calligraffiti was the emergence of the abstract movement in the Middle East during the 20th century. Calligraphy was impacted by the abstract movement in the 1960s and 1970s with the introduction of the [[Hurufiyya movement]] in the Arab world and the Saqqa Khaneh movement in Iran. [[Hassan Massoudy]], [[Hossein Zenderoudi]] and [[Parviz Tanavoli]] were some of the pioneers of this new era of calligraphy. The next two decades saw an initial explosion of graffiti in the context of the first Intifada and the Lebanese Civil War.&lt;ref name="ajammc.com"/&gt; Today, much calligraffiti is influenced by early Islamic script styles like siah [[mashq]] and [[Kufic]]. Artist and activist, Janet Kozak, characterizes calligraffiti artists in the Middle East as being "not bound by the shackles of tradition, yet still indebted to it" who use "a unique blend of traditional scripts and design mixed with modern materials and techniques".

==Beyond the aesthetic==
Calligraffiti has been a way for artists in the Middle East to reclaim the region while still staying grounded in their culture and tradition. From the civil war in Beirut, to the Palestinian intifadas, to the Arab uprisings, calligraffiti has become a mechanism for social and political protest—where letters become symbols.&lt;ref name="printingmuseum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.printingmuseum.org/eventdetail.php?id=162|title=The Exhibitions at the Museum of Printing History|website=Printingmuseum.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most salient characteristics of the Arab Spring has been the reappropriation of the public sphere and calligraffiti does just that. Calligraffiti is an urban art as much as it is a gallery art, and as such it has served as a tool to reclaim public spaces and impose the will and opinion of the people. Once an infrequent sight, graffiti and calligraffiti now adorn the walls of most major cities in the Middle East, representing the rising political and social tensions in the region. Despite most artists' claims that they are neither political or social actors, their art has inevitable impact—as Saudi artist Rana Jarbou said "words are weapons".

===Political uses===
Many calligraffiti artists contest the idea that their art is political. Askar insists his calligraffiti pieces in Palestine do not make him a political activist, he says "I protest in colors, my activism consists of bringing art to the streets and allowing the public to express themselves"; similarly, El Seed has said "I don’t have any political agenda. I don’t believe in politics".&lt;ref name="qatartodayonline.com"/&gt; But by nature, calligraffiti is meant to express a message, and so it has unavoidable social and political consequences.

Protesting political affairs has been the subject of much of the graffiti in the region, and calligraffiti has not escaped this. Much of the anonymous calligraffiti that emerged from the Arab Spring is deeply embedded in a political struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muftah.org/telling-story-arab-spring-interactive-graffiti-map/#.VuwuBJMrLVo|title=Telling the Story of the Arab Spring: an Interactive Graffiti Map|website=muftah.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Seed’s 2011 mural in Kairouan Tunisia, a poem by Abu al-Qasim al-Husayafi about tyranny and injustice, cannot be separated from the political context it was created in. Similarly, Askar’s piece entitled "Palestine" cannot be separated from the political weight the word "Palestine" holds; nor can his piece that says "salaam" (meaning peace), that is shaped like a key, escape the symbolism of the key in the Palestinian occupation. Anonymous calligraffiti on the Israeli wall in Bethlehem is inherently political because of its location.

The exhibit "Contemporary Arabic Graffiti and Lettering" explores how Calligraffiti creates a dialogue between the social and political sphere, by questioning dominant beliefs and ideologies. It does this by imposing itself on the religious and political debates by commandeering public spaces.&lt;ref name="printingmuseum.org"/&gt; Khadiga El Ghawas is one calligraffiti artist that does not shy away from the political messages of her art. She says "My compositions touch upon issues that we currently face in Egypt whether that’s related to politics, religion or society". Her work very explicitly deals with the political realities of Egypt, whether it is political Islam, democracy, or women's issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/|title=The Daily Beast|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social uses===
Calligraffiti, as art, has the power to influence society and the people who are exposed to it. For example, it can be used to bring awareness to lost memories or forgotten moments in history. Inkman's USINA project decorates the forgotten limestone factory walls in Boukornine Tunisia to remind the world of those who struggled there and pay them respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isupportstreetart.com/usina-story-of-brave-men/|title="USINA" Story of brave men - I Support Street Art|date=22 January 2015|website=Isupportstreetart.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Seed's Lost Walls project attempts to redirect the world and Tunisia's attention to the beauty of the country. His purpose was to create hope in Tunisia; that the people of the country could rediscover something positive and be proud of their culture in the midst of political turmoil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alartemag.be/en/en-culture/el-seeds-graffiti-road-trip-through-tunisia/|title=eL Seed's graffiti road trip through Tunisia - al.arte.magazine|date=11 June 2014|website=Alartmag.be|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanese artist Yazan Halwani says his art is means to "write the stories of the city, on its own walls—creating a memory for the city". The civil war created a deep fragmentation within the Lebanese society and a sense of amnesia that Halwani sought to fight against. His calligraffiti is meant to portray the city in a positive light, repair social ties and breathe life into a broken society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/22/beirut-graffiti-artist-yazan-halwani-lebanese|title=How a Beirut graffiti artist is using his murals to try to unite a fragmented city|first=Ellie Violet|last=Bramley|date=22 September 2015|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; GhalamDAR, an Iranian artist, tries to reconnect Iranians to their country and culture. He often questions contemporary identity, philosophy, and history in Iran, which can be seen in his piece on the Iranian diaspora that features a headless deer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquila-style.com/focus-points/muslimlifestyle/ghalamdar-persian-calligraffiti-sensation/101500/|title=GhalamDAR: Persian calligraffiti sensation|website=Aquila-style.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraffiti has been a way for all of these artists to try and better the communities they live in.

Another way in which calligraffiti has impacted the social sphere is by engaging a discuss about contemporary issues and bringing people together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theculturetrip.com/africa/tunisia/articles/tunisia-s-first-calligraffiti-artist-el-seed-politics-power-and-paint/|title=Tunisia's Pioneering 'Calligraffiti' Artist eL Seed|first=Isabella|last=Bengoechea|website=Theculturestrip.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Seed's calligraffiti on the Gabes mosque is a quotation from the Qur'an meant to address intolerance, specifically in regards to religion, art, and the growing Islamist movement in the world. The quote reads "Oh humankind, we have created you from a male and a female and made people and tribes so you may know each other"; it attempts to break stereotypes and opens a discussion around the place of art in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/09/arab-graffiti-vandalism-art-spring|title=Arab graffiti: vandalism or art? - Mohamed El Hebeishy|first=Mohamed El|last=Hebeishy|date=9 September 2012|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing his project "Perception" in Cairo, El Seed explained that he is "questioning the level of judgment and misconception society can unconsciously have upon a community based on their differences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/culture/calligraffiti-master-astonishes-with-remake-of-marginalized-cairo-neighborhood_39640|title="Calligraffiti" master astonishes with remake of marginalized Cairo neighborhood|website=Yourmiddleeast.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Seed has referred to himself as an "artivist", or an artist and an activist at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/04/where-art-blends-with-activism/|title=Where art blends with activism|date=5 April 2012|website=News.harvard.edu=|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calligraffiti: between Middle East and West==
Many calligrafitti artists use Arabic script or are heavily inspired by it. There has been a rise in Arabic calligraffiti outside the Middle East and by non Middle Eastern artists. Arabic calligraffiti has become a cosmopolitan art form. This can partially be attributed to the richness of Arabic calligraphy compared to other scripts. The use of Arabic calligraphy has been a typographic decision by many artists who seek to reinvent the aesthetic.&lt;ref name="ajammc.com"/&gt;

===A search for identity===
The widespread use of Arabic calligraphy outside the Middle East is often a result of political and social dynamics.&lt;ref name="printingmuseum.org"/&gt; Colonization and immigration has led to an identity crisis in many people, one the artist El Seed often talks about. He says his style developed from his struggle to fit in; the feeling that while he was not French, he was not fully Tunisian either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehoya.com/artist-explains-calligraffiti/|title=Artist Explains 'Calligraffiti'|date=27 September 2013|website=Thehoya.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy of colonization has created hybrid identities, especially in Europe, but has also allowed other cultures to be exposed to Middle Eastern cultures. As a result, artists like Julien Breton and L'atlas have adopted the Arabic script style. Artists like Aerosol Arabic or Haji Noor Deen turned to Arabic calligraffiti after they converted to Islam. Many artists use calligraffiti to reconnect with cultural and historical identities that they lost, or as a way to find a new identity.&lt;ref name="printingmuseum.org"/&gt;

==Artists==
Calligraffiti is a relatively new term and graffiti is still taboo in  parts of the Middle East and Asia, and as a result many calligraffiti artists are anonymous or rely on pseudonyms. Additionally, many calligraphers have created calligraffiti pieces, even though it is not their primary focus. In 2015, Niels Shoe Meulman created the Calligraffiti Ambassadors with the aim of expanding the movement and creating a community of calligraffiti artists. The group has already grown since its inception and includes artists from all over the world. They exhibited some of their work at the Affenfaust Gallery in Hamburg, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calligraffitiambassadors.com/|title=Calligraffiti Ambassadors|website=Calligraffitiambassadors.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of China |expanded = Ideology }}
{{Xi Jinping sidebar}}

The '''Chinese Dream''' ({{zh |s = 中国梦 |t = 中國夢 |p = Zhōngguó Mèng }}) is a term popularized after 2013 within [[socialism with Chinese characteristics|Chinese society]] that describes a set of personal and national [[ethos]] and ideals in [[China]] and the [[Government of China]].&lt;ref name="Socialism"&gt;{{cite web |title = The Chinese Dream infuses Socialism with Chinese characteristics with New Energy |url = http://chinacopyrightandmedia.wordpress.com/2013/05/06/the-chinese-dream-infuses-socialism-with-chinese-characteristics-with-new-energy/ |work = [[Qiushi]] |author = [[Central Party School of the Communist Party of China|Central Party School]]/[[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] |accessdate = 9 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by journalists, government officials, and activists to describe the role of the individual in Chinese society as well as the goals of the [[zhonghua minzu|Chinese nation]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21577063-chinas-new-leader-has-been-quick-consolidate-his-power-what-does-he-now-want-his Chasing the Chinese dream]", ''The Economist'', 4 May 2013, pp.&amp;nbsp;24–26].&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is closely associated with [[Xi Jinping]], who is the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] ([[Paramount leader]]). Xi began promoting the phrase as a slogan in a high-profile visit to the [[National Museum of China]] in November 2012 after taking the office of general secretary.&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;"Xi Jinping and the Chinese Dream," [https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21577070-vision-chinas-new-president-should-serve-his-people-not-nationalist-state-xi-jinping ''The Economist'' May 4, 2013, p 11 (editorial)]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, use of the phrase has become widespread in official announcements and the embodiment of the political ideology of the leadership under Xi Jinping. Xi said that young people should "dare to dream, work assiduously to fulfill the dreams and contribute to the revitalization of the nation".&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;Yang Yi, "Youth urged to contribute to realization of 'Chinese dream'", [http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-05/04/c_132359537.htm Xinhuanet English.news.cn 4 May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the party's theoretical journal ''[[Qiushi]]'', the Chinese Dream is about Chinese prosperity, collective effort, socialism, and national glory.&lt;ref name="中国梦区别于美国梦"&gt;{{cite web |script-title = zh:中国梦区别于美国梦的七大特征 |trans-title = Seven reasons why the Chinese Dream is different from the American Dream |url = http://www.qstheory.cn/zz/zgtsshzyll/201305/t20130520_232259.htm |language = zh | work = [[Qiushi]] |publisher = [[Central Party School of the Communist Party of China|Central Party School]]/[[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of China]]  | accessdate = 9 June 2013 | author = Shi, Yuzhi | date = 20 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the phrase and the [[American Dream]] has been debated.

== History ==
=== Chinese literature ===
The phrase "China Dream" (中国梦), and the associated idea of a collective hope for restoring China's lost national greatness, have ancient origins in Chinese literary and intellectual history.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;Ryan Mitchell, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ryan-mitchell/clearing-up-some-misconce_b_8012152.html "Clearing Up Some Misconceptions About Xi Jinping’s ‘China Dream"], ''HuffPost'', 20 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In the Classic of Poetry (''Shi Jing''), the poem "Flowing Spring" (下泉) describes a poet waking up in despair after dreaming of the former [[Western Zhou]] dynasty. During the troubled [[Southern Song]] dynasty, the poet Zheng Sixiao wrote a poem in which he coined the phrase "Heart full of [the] China Dream (中国梦), the ancient poem 'Flowing Spring.'"&lt;ref&gt;Qiangan, Wang. "The Origin of the Words" China Dream." Contemporary China History Studies 6 (2013): 020.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, popular patriotic literary and theatrical works in early 20th century China also made reference to a "China Dream," before the concept of the "American Dream" was invented in 1931.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com" /&gt;

=== US literature ===
In 2008, architect Neville Mars, author Adrian Hornsby, and the Dynamic City Foundation published "The Chinese Dream – a society under construction".&lt;ref name="Mars and Hornsby The Chinese Dream"&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Neville Mars |author2 = Adrian Hornsby |title = The Chinese Dream – a society under construction |url = http://www.nai010.com/component/zoo/item/the-chinese-dream |year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book investigates China's initial wave of rapid urbanization as it transitions to a socialist-market economy. Maps of the emerging spatial forms and analysis of the economic development processes that have originated within the extreme conditions of the 1980s and 1990s are combined with progressive planning concepts and personal portraits of a rapidly changing society. As such it synthesizes a body of research to tackle the main paradoxes at the heart of China's struggle for change and a more equitable and sustainable future.

According to Mars, "The present is so all-consuming that fast realities threaten to eclipse the slow dream of tomorrow." The overarching premise of the book is that China reveals a direct correlation between its shifting urban forms and its waning societal objectives. In that sense the book has arguably been prophetic. Written eight years ahead of the 12th FYP that holds the same thematic title "The Chinese Dream" ({{zh |s = 中国梦 |p = Zhōngguó Mèng }}) it introduces the notion that China's highly fragmented, sclerotic urban patterns determine a path of increasing inefficiency and energy-dependence. Mars introduces the term "MUD", or Market-driven Unintentional Development to describe this new hybrid urban condition, and suggests that planning itself needs to be radically redefined in order to be effective and not contribute to the extreme ex-urbanization. The conclusion of the book is "No New Cities" (杜绝新城), and a call for models of upgrading of existing urban centers and suburbs.

In 2010, author Helen H. Wang published her first book ''The Chinese Dream''.&lt;ref name="Wang The Chinese Dream"&gt;{{cite book |author = Helen H. Wang |title=The Chinese Dream: The Rise of the World's Largest Middle Class |asin = 1452898049 |origyear = 2010 |year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is based on over 100 interviews of the new members of the middle class in China. In the book, Wang did not define the Chinese Dream; rather, she conveyed the hopes and dreams of the Chinese people through intimate portraits of this growing demographic.

''The Chinese Dream'' has won [[Eric Hoffer]] Book Awards. In 2011, the book was translated into Chinese《中国梦》and published in China. In 2012, the second edition of ''The Chinese Dream'' with a foreword by [[Lord Wei]] was published. In the foreword, Wei wrote:
{{quote|The Chinese Dream today as portrayed in Helen's book speaks of a changing China that is discovering consumerism, that is increasingly globalised, and also at a cross roads. Will her path in years to come continue to be one that resembles that of Western countries with all the benefits of further urbanization,wealth, and industrialization, but at the same time challenges in managing scarce resources, population migration, and the social problems that affluence can bring, elsewhere called 'Affluenza'? Or will the Chinese people themselves inside and outside China create a new sustainable Chinese Dream, based on their ancient values of respect for culture, family, and nature, harnessing technology and creativity?&lt;ref name="Mars and Hornsby The Chinese Dream" /&gt;}}

In September 2012, Helen H. Wang gave a copy of her book ''The Chinese Dream'' to [[Thomas Friedman|Tom Friedman]] at a dinner in Shanghai hosted by Peggy Liu, chairwoman of [[JUCCCE|Joint US-China Collaboration on Clean Energy]] (JUCCCE).

=== ''The New York Times'' ===
[[File:Thomas Friedman Key Note Address at the National Conference on the Creative Economy.jpg|thumb|Thomas Friedman's ''New York Times'' article has been credited with popularizing the phrase "Chinese Dream" in China.]]
The British publication ''[[The Economist]]'' credits a column written by the American journalist [[Thomas Friedman]] for popularizing the term in China. A translation of Friedman's article, "China Needs Its Own Dream", published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' (October 2012) was widely popular in China.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; Friedman attributes the phrase to Peggy Liu, the founder of the environmentalist NGO [[JUCCCE]]. According to Friedman in the magazine ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', "I only deserve part credit... the concept of 'China Dream' was created by my friend Peggy Liu, as the motto for her NGO about how to introduce Chinese to the concept of sustainability."&lt;ref name=FP&gt;{{cite news|last=Fish|first=Isaac Stone|title=Thomas Friedman: I only deserve partial credit for coining the 'Chinese dream'|url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/05/03/thomas_friedman_i_only_deserve_partial_credit_for_coining_the_chinese_dream|newspaper=Foreign Policy|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Fallows of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' has pointed out that the phrase has frequently been used in the past by journalists. He mentions Deborah Fallow's book ''Dreaming in Chinese'', his own article "What Is the Chinese Dream?", and Gerald Lemos' book ''The End of the Chinese Dream'' as examples.&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite news|last=Fallows|first=James|title=Today's China Notes: Dreams, Obstacles|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/05/todays-china-notes-dreams-obstacles/275544/|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Fallows, ''The Economist'' cites an article in the ''Xinhua Daily Telegraph'' that directly credits Friedman.&lt;ref name="economist2"&gt;{{cite news|title=The role of Thomas Friedman|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/analects/2013/05/chinese-dream-0|newspaper=The Economist|date=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"Will the next Chinese leader have a dream that is different from the American dream?" [a paraphrase of a line in Mr Friedman's column]. In a year of political transition, the world's gaze is focused on the east. On the eve of the 18th [Communist Party] congress [at which Mr Xi had been appointed as party chief two weeks earlier] the American columnist Thomas Friedman wrote an article devoted to analysis of the "Chinese dream" titled "China Needs Its Own Dream". It expressed the hope that [the dream would be one that] "marries people's expectations of prosperity with a more sustainable China". Suddenly the "Chinese dream" became a hot topic among commentators at home and abroad.|''Xinhua Daily Telegraph''&lt;ref name="economist2" /&gt; }}

''The Economist'' writes that references to Friedman's article have also appeared in other Chinese media outlets, including a translation in ''The References News'', in an article written for China's [[State Council Information Office]], on the cover of the magazine ''Oriental Outlook'' as the main caption, in a magazine article published by ''Frontline'', and in an article for a local newspaper written by China's ambassador to Romania, [[Huo Yuzhen]].&lt;ref name="economist2"/&gt; In the preface of the ''Oriental Outlook'' "Chinese Dream" issue, the editor states that "the 18th national congress of the Chinese Communist Party convened November 8th. "Does the next generation of Chinese leaders have a 'Chinese Dream' that is different from the "American Dream"?.... This was a question raised by one of America's most influential media figures, Thomas Friedman."&lt;ref name="economist2"/&gt;

[[File:Xi Jiping cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Xi Jinping, Chinese leader, adopted "Chinese Dream" as a slogan in 2013.]]
Just after becoming [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] in late 2012, Xi announced what would become the hallmark of his administration. "The Chinese Dream," he said, is "the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation." Xi's Chinese Dream is described as achieving the [[Two Centenaries]]: the material goal of China becoming a "moderately well-off society" by 2021, the 100th anniversary of the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]], and the modernization goal of China becoming a [[Developed country|fully developed nation]] by about 2049, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/opinion/global/xi-jinpings-chinese-dream.html|title=Xi Jinping's Chinese Dream|first=Robert Lawrence|last=Kuhn|date=4 June 2013|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, [[Xi Jinping]] called upon young people "to dare to dream, work assiduously to fulfill the dreams and contribute to the revitalization of the nation". He called upon all levels of the Party and the government to facilitate favorable conditions for their career development.  Xi told young people to "cherish the glorious youth, strive with pioneer spirit and contribute their wisdom and energy to the realization of the Chinese dream".&lt;ref name="Yang" /&gt;

According to [[Robert Lawrence Kuhn]], who is an international investment banker and the author of "How China's Leaders Think: The Inside Story of China's Reform and What This Means for the Future", the Chinese Dream has four parts: Strong China (economically, politically, diplomatically, scientifically, militarily); Civilized China (equity and fairness, rich culture, high morals); Harmonious China (amity among social classes); Beautiful China (healthy environment, low pollution). Khun states that "a moderately well-off society" is where all citizens, rural and urban, enjoy high standards of living. This includes doubling the 2010 G.D.P. per capita (approaching $10,000 per person) by about 2020 and completing urbanization (roughly one billion people, 70 percent of China's population) by about 2030. "Modernization" means China regaining its position as a world leader in science and technology as well as in economics and business; the resurgence of Chinese civilization, culture and military might; and China participating actively in all areas of human endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2013-07/19/content_16814756.htm|title=Understanding the Chinese dream|website=Chinadaily.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporters have noted that, "Mr Xi had seen the American dream up close, having spent a couple of weeks in 1985 with a rural family in Iowa. (He revisited them during a trip to America last year as leader-in-waiting.)"&lt;ref&gt;"Chasing the Chinese dream," ''The Economist'' 4 May 2013, p 25]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinese Dream AD TJA.jpg|thumb|A propaganda-like ad running since 2015 promoting the Chinese dream aboard an aeroplane.]]
The concept of Chinese Dream is very similar to the idea of the "[[American Dream]]". It stresses the importance of entrepreneurial spirit. It also glorifies a generation of self-made men and women in post-reform China such as those rural immigrants who moved to the urban centers and achieved magnificent improvement in terms of their living standards and social life. Chinese Dream can be interpreted as the collective consciousness of Chinese people during the era of social transformation and economic progress.

As an aspect of political thought in contemporary China, the emergence of Chinese Dream indicates a diversion of political ideology from egalitarianism to a relatively more libertarian individualist approach. {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} It is worth noting that the concept is still based on collectivism rather than individualism for it sees the subject of Chinese Dream as the people of China as a whole instead of specific individuals.

The idea was put forward by the new [[CPC general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] on 29 November 2012 and repeated by him on numerous important occasions.  The Communist Party's propaganda chief, Liu Yunshan, has directed that the concept of the Chinese dream be incorporated into school textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;"Chasing the Chinese dream," ''The Economist'' 4 May 2013, pp 24–26]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article for the Huffington Post, French sinologist [[David Gosset]] (高大伟) presented the idea that the Liyuan Style is an illustration of the China Dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-gosset/the-china-dream-and-the-l_b_3317354.html|title = The China Dream and the Liyuan Style|date = 22 May 2013|accessdate = 13 June 2013|website = HuffPost|last = Gosset|first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; China's new First Lady Peng Liyuan is at the intersection of what Gosset calls "Modern China", "Civilizational China" and "Global China".

=== Huang Yongjun, the general manager of New Classic Press (UK) ===
Huang Yongjun, the founder and general manager of New Classic Press (UK) is a major advocator of the "China Dream" in the United Kingdom. The New Classic Press is an effort to "explain China to the world" by Huang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zentopia-culture.com/single-post/2017/01/01/Huang-Yongjun-the-man-who-brought-the-China-dream-to-the-UK|title=Huang Yongjun: the man who brought the "China dream" to the UK|date=31 December 2016|accessdate=1 January 2017|work=Zentopia Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
The Chinese Dream is vaguely defined, and has led to multiple interpretations describing the phrase's meaning.&lt;ref name=theeconomist&gt;{{cite news|title=Chasing the Chinese dream|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21577063-chinas-new-leader-has-been-quick-consolidate-his-power-what-does-he-now-want-his|newspaper=The Economist|date=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compared to the American Dream===
Author Helen H. Wang was one of the first to connect the Chinese Dream with the [[American Dream]]. In her book ''The Chinese Dream'',&lt;ref name="Mars and Hornsby The Chinese Dream" /&gt; Wang wrote: "The Chinese Dream, taking its title from the American Dream, alluding to an easily identifiable concept..." Wang attempts to demonstrate that the Chinese people have similar dreams as those of the American people. "This new [Chinese] middle class," Wang wrote, "which barely existed a decade ago, will reach the size of more than two Americas in a decade or two. They number in the hundreds of millions, with the same hopes and dreams that you and I have: to have a better life, to give our children an even better life...". Wang has also claimed that "Chinese people must define their own dream".&lt;ref&gt;Helen H. Wang (Feb. 2013), "[https://www.forbes.com/sites/helenwang/2013/02/05/chinese-people-must-define-their-own-dream/ Chinese People Must Define Their Own Dream]", ''Forbes''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sustainable development ===
The China Dream has been defined as [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Friedman|first=Thomas|title=China Needs Its Own Dream|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/03/opinion/friedman-china-needs-its-own-dream.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peggy Liu and the NGO [[JUCCCE]] coined the phrase "China Dream" as a movement based on sustainability,&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; which was later popularized in China through a ''New York Times'' article and adopted by Xi Jinping.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt; Pollution and food safety are popular concerns in China.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; Cities are frequently covered by smog and the country's rivers are polluted with industrial waste.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite news|last=Rachman|first=Gideon|title=The Chinese dream is smothered by toxic smog|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/618f93a8-b318-11e2-b5a5-00144feabdc0.html|newspaper=Financial Times|date=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; China's rising middle class is expected to increase by 500 million people by 2025 and will continue to put a strain on the country's dwindling resources.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; According to Liu, the Chinese Dream of [[sustainability]] can be achieved through the promotion of [[green technologies]] and the reduction of widespread [[conspicuous consumption]].&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Liu|first=Peggy|title=China dream: a lifestyle movement with sustainability at its heart|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/china-dream-sustainable-living-behaviour-change|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; China's high growth has caused widespread environmental damage, and without environmental reforms, the deterioration could threaten the legitimacy of the Communist Party.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; The Chinese Dream is a dream of a prosperous lifestyle reconciled with a sustainable lifestyle.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

=== National renewal ===
The Chinese Dream has been viewed as a call for China's rising international influence. Xi Jinping refers to the dream as a form of national rejuvenation.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"/&gt; Young Chinese are envious of America's cultural influence and hope that China could one day rival the US as a cultural exporter.&lt;ref name=thenyt&gt;{{cite news|last=Tatlow|first=Didi Kirsten|title=Nationalistic and Chasing the 'Chinese Dream'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/13/world/asia/13iht-letter13.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of Chinese military support China's military development, opining that the "strong-nation dream of a great revival of the Chinese people" can only result from a "strong-army dream".Former [[United States Secretary of State]] [[John Kerry]] has promoted the idea of a "Pacific Dream" to accommodate China's rise through regional collaboration over shared interests like the environment and economic growth.&lt;ref name="economist2"/&gt;

=== Individual dreams ===
Many Chinese have interpreted the Chinese dream as the pursuit of individual dreams. [[Evan Osnos]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' concludes that "Xi Jinping has sought to inspire his people by raising the flag of the China Dream, but they have interpreted it as China ''Dreams''—plural."&lt;ref name="New Yorker"&gt;{{cite news|last=Osnos|first=Evan|authorlink=Evan Osnos|title=Can China deliver the China dream(s)?|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/evanosnos/2013/03/can-china-deliver-the-china-dreams.html|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese Dream is defined according to an individual's personal aspirations and desires, which may lead to "the proliferation of 1.3&amp;nbsp;billion China Dreams."&lt;ref name="New Yorker"/&gt; Sujian Guo and Baogang Guo argue, "To a great extent, the American dream has been exported to China and has become the Chinese dream."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sujian Guo|author2=Baogang Guo|title=Greater China in an Era of Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HXHMBQ0qn6gC&amp;pg=PA20|year=2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; But according to official party journal ''[[Qiushi]]'', the Chinese Dream is not about individual glory, but about [[Collectivism|collective effort]].&lt;ref name="中国梦区别于美国梦" /&gt; Measuring public sentiment on [[Sina Weibo]], Christopher Marquis and Zoe Yang of CivilChina.org found that the Chinese Dream refers more to the [[common good]]s bestowed by [[civil society]] than it does to individual achievements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilchina.org/2013/06/a-tale-of-two-dreams/] {{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A main aim of the Chinese state propaganda is therefore the construction of links between individual and national aspirations, which also signifies the convergence of the values of the market economy and state nationalism. This is evident in Chinese entertainment television. In a genre of reality shows in public speaking, for example, contestants frequently connect between their "dreams" and the triumph of China and further emphasize the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party in delivering a better future.&lt;ref&gt;Hizi, Gil (2018) [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10304312.2018.1536967 "Speaking the China Dream: self-realization and nationalism in China’s public-speaking shows"]. ''Continuum''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic and political reform ===
Some government officials and activists view the Chinese Dream as a need for economic and political reform.&lt;ref name=scmp&gt;{{cite news|last=Jane|first=Cai|title=Xi Jinping outlines his vision of 'dream and renaissance'|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1193273/xi-jinping-outlines-his-vision-chinas-dream-and-renaissance|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustaining China's economic growth requires economic reform encompassing urbanization, the reduction of government bureaucracy, and weakening the power of [[special interests]].&lt;ref name=scmp/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{cite news|last=Bishop|first=Bill|title=As China's Economy Stumbles, Government Eyes Reform|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/as-chinas-economy-stumbles-government-eyes-reform/|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese liberals have defined the Chinese Dream as a dream of [[constitutionalism]]. ''[[Southern Weekly]]'', a liberal newspaper based in Guangzhou, attempted to publish an editorial titled "The Chinese dream: a dream of constitutionalism" which advocated the [[separation of powers]], but was censored by the authorities.&lt;ref name=theeconomist/&gt; Both Xi Jinping and Premier [[Li Keqiang]] support economic reform, but have shied away from discussing political reform. Premier Li has said that "But however deep the water may be, we will wade into the water. This is because we have no alternative. Reform concerns the destiny of our country and the future of our nation."&lt;ref name=scmp/&gt; According to official party sources, the Chinese Dream is the "essence of Socialism with Chinese characteristics".&lt;ref name="Socialism"/&gt;

In October 2013, Britain's [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[George Osborne]], described the Chinese Dream as a political reform that includes "rebalancing from investment to consumption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chancellor's speech to students at Peking University|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellors-speech-to-students-at-peking-university|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|accessdate=16 October 2013|quote=China too is striving under its new leadership to achieve more balanced and sustainable growth – and for you that means the opposite. Rebalancing from investment to consumption. This is part of Xi's vision to achieve the 'China Dream'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion'''''|コードギアス 反逆のルルーシュ|Kōdo Giasu: Hangyaku no Rurūshu}}, often referred to as simply ''Code Geass'', is a Japanese [[anime]] [[Television program|series]] created by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]], directed by [[Gorō Taniguchi]], and written by [[Ichirō Ōkouchi]], with original character designs by manga authors [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]]. Set in an [[Alternate history|alternate timeline]], the series focuses on how the former prince [[Lelouch Lamperouge|Lelouch vi Britannia]] obtains a power known as Geass and decides to use it to obliterate the [[List of Code Geass characters#Holy Britannian Empire|Holy Britannian Empire]], a [[superpower]] that has been conquering various countries.

''Code Geass'' first ran in Japan on [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]] from October 5, 2006, to July 28, 2007. Its sequel series, {{Nihongo|'''''Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2'''''|コードギアス 反逆のルルーシュR2|Kōdo Giasu Hangyaku no Rurūshu Āru Tsū}}, ran as a simulcast on [[Japan News Network|JNN]] stations (like MBS and [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]) from April 6, 2008 to September 28, 2008. The series has also been adapted into various [[manga]] and [[light novel]]s with the former showing various alternate scenarios from the TV series. [[Bandai Entertainment]] also licensed most parts from the franchise for English release in December 2007, airing the two TV series on [[Adult Swim]]. Most manga and light novels have also been published in North America by Bandai. At the ''Code Geass'' 10th anniversary event on November 27, 2016, it was announced that the series will be receiving a new anime, along with a compilation film trilogy in 2017 that recaped the events from both seasons of the anime series. A new film, titled {{Nihongo|'''''Code Geass: Lelouch of the Re;surrection'''''|コードギアス 復活のルルーシュ|Kōdo Giasu: Fukkatsu no Rurūshu}}, will take place several years after the Zero Requiem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-11-27/code-geass-gets-new-sequel-and-anime-compilation-film-trilogy/.109224|title=Code Geass Gets New Sequel &amp; Anime Compilation Film Trilogy|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/11/27/code-geass-compilation-movies-to-prepare-for-new-sequel?referrer=community|title="Code Geass" Compilation Movies To Prepare For New Sequel|publisher=[[Crunchyroll]]|date=November 28, 2016|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nagamedigital.com/2016/11/28/code-geass-lelouch-of-the-resurrection/|title=Code Geass Lelouch of the Resurrection &amp; Lead Up Compilation Movie Announced|publisher=nagamedigital.com|date=November 28, 2016|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be released in theaters on February 9, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.animatetimes.com/news/details.php?id=1533283160&lt;/ref&gt;

The anime television series has been well received in Japan, selling over a million DVD and Blu-ray Disc volumes. Both seasons have won several awards at the [[Tokyo International Anime Fair]], ''[[Animage]]'' Anime Grand Prix, and [[Animation Kobe]] event. Critics have praised the series for its large audience appeal as well as the cross conflicts shown among the main characters and the moral questions presented.

==Plot==
{{See also|List of Code Geass characters}}
&lt;!-- Please do not add 55 years differences - official date is 2017 a.t.b. as Revolution Year 228. Revolution Year is started on Storming of the Bastille, 2017-228=1789. --&gt;
The story is set in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative timeline]] where the world is divided into three [[superpower]]s: the Holy Britannian Empire (the Americas; also called Britannia), the Chinese Federation (Asia), and the European Union (Europe and Africa; previously known as the Euro-Universe, also known as Europa United in ''Akito the Exiled''). The story takes place after the Holy Britannian Empire's conquest of Japan on August 10, 2010 a.t.b., by means of Britannia's newest weapon, the "Autonomous Armored Knight", or "Knightmare Frame". In turn, Britannia effectively strips Japan and its citizens of all rights and freedoms and renames the country Area 11 with its citizens referred to as Elevens.

[[Lelouch vi Britannia]] is an exiled Britannian prince, son of Emperor [[Charles zi Britannia]] and his royal consort [[Marianne vi Britannia]]. Lelouch has one sister, [[Nunnally vi Britannia]]. Marianne was brutally murdered in the palace and Nunnally, who witnessed the murder of their mother, was so traumatized she lost both her sight and ability to walk. Lelouch is furious with his father, believing his father failed his mother and sister by turning a blind eye to their mother's death and failing to pursue their mother's killer.

The story begins with Lelouch and Nunnally being sent as political pawns to Japan to lull the Japanese government into a false sense of security. After the siblings are sent to Japan, Japan is attacked and defeated by Britannia. With the ruins of Japan as a background, Lelouch vows to his Japanese friend [[Suzaku Kururugi]] that he will one day obliterate Britannia as an act of vengeance against his father.

Seven years later, Lelouch (now going by the name Lelouch Lamperouge), is now a popular yet withdrawn student at Ashford Academy. Lelouch becomes involved in a terrorist attack and finds a mysterious girl called [[C.C. (Code Geass)|C.C.]] (C2), who saves Lelouch's life from the Britannian Royal Guard, by making a contract with him and granting Lelouch a power known as {{nihongo|Geass|ギアス|Giasu}}. This power, also known as the {{nihongo|"Power of Kings"|王の力|Ō no Chikara}}, allows him to command anyone to do whatever he wants, including bending their will to live, fight, or die on his behalf.  This power can affect an individual just once and only through direct eye contact. Lelouch decides to use his Geass to find his mother's murderers, destroy the Britannian Empire, and create a better world where Nunnally can live happily. In the process, Lelouch becomes Zero, a masked vigilante and the leader of the resistance movement known as The Black Knights, gaining popularity and support among the Japanese on his way towards the rebellion of Britannia. However, this does not come without a cost. Caught up in a conflict where he does not know the full extent of his powers, Lelouch will have to battle Suzaku, a resistance member named [[Kallen Stadtfeld]], the strongest army in the world, his own half-siblings, and many others in a battle that will forever change the world.

==Production==
''Code Geass'' began as a concept developed at Sunrise by [[Ichirō Ōkouchi]] and [[Gorō Taniguchi]], who proposed it to producer Yoshitaka Kawaguchi. Kawaguchi had previously approached Okouchi and Taniguchi during the production of ''[[Planetes]]''.&lt;ref name="ōkouchi-interview"&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with Ichirō Ōkouchi|work=Code Geass DVD Volume 1|publisher=[[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea for the plot consisted of a "hero" who led a secret organization, which was later developed into a conflict between two characters with different values and who belonged to the same military unit, who eventually became [[Lelouch Lamperouge]] and [[Suzaku Kururugi]].&lt;ref name="ōkouchi-interview" /&gt;

During these initial planning stages, Kawaguchi also contacted the noted [[Mangaka|manga artist]] group [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]].&lt;ref name="ōkouchi-interview"/&gt; This was the first time Clamp had ever been requested to design the characters of an anime series.&lt;ref name="taniguchi-ōkawa-interview"&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with Gorō Taniguchi and [[Nanase Ohkawa|Ageha Ōkawa]], head writer of [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]]|work=[[Newtype]], May 2007 issue}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clamp signed onto the project early during these development stages and provided numerous ideas, which helped develop the series' setting and characters.&lt;ref name="taniguchi-ōkawa-interview"/&gt;

While developing the character designs for Lelouch, the protagonist of the series, Clamp had originally conceived of his hair color as being white.&lt;ref name="taniguchi-ōkawa-interview"/&gt; [[Nanase Ohkawa|Ageha Ohkawa]], head writer at Clamp, said she had visualized him as being a character to which "everyone" could relate to as being "cool", literally, a "beauty".&lt;ref name="taniguchi-ōkawa-interview"/&gt; During these planning stages, Clamp and the Sunrise staff had discussed a number of possible inspirations for the characters, including [[KinKi Kids]] and [[Tackey &amp; Tsubasa]].&lt;ref name="taniguchi-ōkawa-interview"/&gt; They had wanted to create a "hit show," a series which would appeal to "everyone."&lt;ref name="taniguchi-ōkawa-interview"/&gt; Lelouch's alter ego, Zero, was one of the earliest developed characters, with Ōkouchi having wanted a mask to be included as a part of the series, feeling it was necessary for it to be a Sunrise show, and Clamp wanting a unique design never prior seen in any Sunrise series (said mask was nicknamed "[[tulip]]" for its distinctive design).&lt;ref name="taniguchi-ōkawa-interview"/&gt;

The concept for the Geass may have been inspired by the Irish and Welsh legends of "[[Geas]]" or "Geis". A geas is a compulsion laid on someone to do or not do something. While the geas itself does not lie on any spectrum, the benefits or actions of it may be decidedly benevolent or malevolent. The concept fits in into the wider fictional world and its lore of British inspirations.

Clamp's finalized original character design art, illustrated by its lead artist [[Mokona]], was subsequently converted into animation character designs for the series by Sunrise's character designer [[Takahiro Kimura]], who had previously spent "every day" analyzing Clamp's art and style from their artbooks and manga series.&lt;ref name="taniguchi-ōkawa-interview"/&gt; In working on the animation character designs, he focused on designing them so as to enable the series' other animators to apply them without deviating from Clamp's original art style.&lt;ref name="taniguchi-ōkawa-interview"/&gt;

The music for the series was composed by [[Kōtarō Nakagawa]] and Hitomi Kuroishi, who had earlier worked with the series' core staff in ''Planetes'' and Taniguchi's earlier work ''[[Gun X Sword]]''. In addition to the [[incidental music]] featured in each episode, Kuroishi also composed numerous insert songs for the series, including "Stories", "Masquerade", "Alone", and "Innocent Days", which were each performed by Kuroishi herself, while "Picaresque" and "Callin'" were performed by the [[singer-songwriter]] [[Mikio Sakai]], who had also earlier worked with Nakagawa and Kuroishi in ''Planetes''. The bands [[Flow (band)|FLOW]], [[Ali Project]], [[Jinn (band)|Jinn]], [[SunSet Swish]], [[Access (group)|Access]], and [[Orange Range]] have provided songs for the opening and ending themes.&lt;ref name="offsite-cd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geass.jp/cd.html|script-title=ja:コードギアス 反逆のルルーシュ 公式サイト|language=Japanese|accessdate=2007-03-10|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306031842/http://www.geass.jp/cd.html|archive-date=2007-03-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;!--https://web.archive.org/20090618055424/http://www.geass.jp/cd.html--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flowwe-news"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flow.mu/07/news/detail.php|title=8/13 New Single｢World End｣発売決定!!|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323145627/http://www.flow.mu/07/news/detail.php|archive-date=2008-03-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the series was being developed for broadcast on [[Mainichi Broadcasting System]], it had been given the network's Saturday evening [[prime time]] slot, which was later changed to a Thursday [[late night anime|late night time]] slot. Due to this change, the overall outlook and some elements of the series were changed and further developed to suit the more mature, late night audience.&lt;ref name="ōkouchi-interview"/&gt; The supernatural "Geass" ability finally came into the show at this point and was first conceived as a special power granted by an "angel" to the main characters, though this last part was also modified.&lt;ref name="ōkouchi-interview" /&gt;

On April 15, 2008, at 17:00 [[Japan Standard Time|JST]], the last 6 minutes of the then unaired third episode was accidentally posted onto the Internet due to an error by [[Bandai Channel]], Bandai's online broadcast channel and the series online distributor, in the midst of testing a system preventing illegal online uploads.&lt;ref name="official-site-statement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geass.jp/enter/enter.html|title=コードギアス 反逆のルルーシュR2 公式サイト|publisher=[[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]]|date=2008-04-16|accessdate=2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|''Code Geass: The Miraculous Birthday''|コードギアス 反逆のルルーシュ キセキの誕生日|Kōdo Giasu: Kiseki no Tanjōbi}} picture drama was based on a live event held in Tokyo, Japan on Lelouch's birthday.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The official website for the first Nintendo DS game launched on July 16, 2007, with the game being released a few months later on October 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geass-game.jp|script-title=ja:コードギアス ゲームサイト|language=Japanese|accessdate=2007-07-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701114056/http://www.geass-game.jp/|archivedate=2007-07-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second game, titled ''Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion Lost Colors'', was developed for the [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[PlayStation 2]], and released in Japan on March 27, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geass-game.jp/ps/index.html|title=コードギアス 反逆のルルーシュ LOST COLORS|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[visual novel]] game which follows a new protagonist named {{nihongo|Rai|ライ}}, who suffers from amnesia. He has a Geass ability similar to [[Lelouch Lamperouge|Lelouch]]'s, but activated by voice.

The third game for the [[Nintendo DS]] is a collection of minigames featuring [[super deformed]] forms of the characters. The player moves along a board through dice rolls, landing on different spots to activate minigames. The minigames are parody-style events with multiple genres. These include helping Jeremiah grow oranges, racing against C.C. and Shirley in swimming, and a sidescrolling beat-em-up featuring Kallen in Guren-like armor.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}&lt;!-- This would not need citation if the game's name was given. --&gt;

''Code Geass R2'' appeared in [[From Software]] (''[[Demon's Souls]]'', ''[[Armored Core]]'') and [[Banpresto]]'s  [[PlayStation 3]] exclusive [[mecha]] action game ''[[Another Century's Episode R]]'', released in Japan in August 2010 and in which both versions of Suzaku's Lancelot, Lelouch's Shinkiro, both versions of Kallen's Guren, and C.C.'s Akatsuki are playable. A fourth installment of the ACE franchise for the PlayStation Portable, [[Another Century's Episode Portable]], included Suzaku's Lancelot Albion and Lelouch/Zero's Shinkiro.

''Code Geass'' characters have appeared as costumes in the Japanese version of the PlayStation 3 game ''[[Tales of Graces|Tales of Graces F]]''. These characters are Zero, Suzaku, C.C. and Kallen. These costumes were never released from the US version for unknown reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abyssalchronicles.com/?fn_mode=comments&amp;fn_id=505 |title=New Tales of Graces f Costumes Include a Code Geass Set + Narikiri Dolls |author=a745 |date=November 1, 2010 |work= |publisher=Abyssal Chronicles |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
''Code Geass'' has received best-selling success and broad critical acclaim since its release. Despite the wide variety of mecha designed and prominently featuring in the show, fans of ''Code Geass'' are of a wide variety and not always attracted purely to the Knightmare combat scenes. [[Anime News Network]]'s columnist Todd Ciolek attributes the soaring popularity of ''Code Geass'' to "the series hitting every important fan sector", with the audience appeal points ranging from a "complex cast of characters and a fast-paced story, told with Goro Taniguchi's capable direction" for "general-interest fans" to "pretty and just-a-little-broken heroes" for "[[yaoi]]-buying female fans".&lt;ref name="ANN_TC_XB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-x-button/2008-08-13|title=The X Button: Revolutionary Jargon|author=Ciolek, Todd|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2008-08-13|accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Kimlinger also finds that the series "has the skill and energy to carry viewers over the top with it, where they can spend a pleasurable few hours reveling in its melodramatic charms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/code-geass-lelouch-of-the-rebellion/dvd-1 |title=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion DVD 1-2 – Review |publisher=Anime News Network |date= |accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also adds that Taniguchi "executes the excesses of his series with care, skillfully intercutting events as Lelouch's plans come together (or fall apart) and using kinetic mecha combat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/code-geass/lelouch-of-the-rebellion/dvd-part-3 |title=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion DVD Part 3 – Review |publisher=Anime News Network |date= |accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlo Santos of Anime News Network wrote that the franchise "in a way, [...] reflects the [[malaise]] of a generation: the realization that old, rich, powerful people have screwed up the world and that the young are helpless to do anything about it". According to him, Lelouch's actions exemplify the wish to see problems like "[[economic collapse]], [[class conflict]], political instability, [[extremism|radical extremism]]" solved by "Zero's [[vigilante]] methods" but Santos expresses doubt in such an approach and concludes that "the series is at its best when raising questions rather than offering a final solution".&lt;ref name="ANN_G1_rev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/code-geass-lelouch-of-the-rebellion/gn-1|title=''Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion GN 1-2'' – Review|author=Santos, Carlo|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2008-09-28|accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; T.H.E.M. Anime Reviewer Dallas Marshall gave the series 4 out of 5 stars, stating "A melodramatic piece of science fiction that has more than enough going for it in terms of action and visuals but tends to go overboard with its emotionalism. If this minor flaw can be overlooked, there is an epic story to be told with a rather intriguing main character at the helm. Take away one star if that minor 'flaw' cannot be ignored."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=1486|title=Code Geass|publisher=T.H.E.M Anime Reviews|accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Death Becomes Her''''' is a 1992 American [[black comedy]] [[fantasy film]] directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]], written by [[David Koepp]] and Martin Donovan, and starring [[Meryl Streep]], [[Bruce Willis]], and [[Goldie Hawn]]. The film focuses on a pair of rivals (Streep and Hawn), who drink a magic potion that promises [[Elixir of life|eternal youth]], but experience unpleasant side effects when they physically die, becoming walking, talking corpses.

''Death Becomes Her'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]]. The film was a commercial success, grossing $149 million worldwide ($58 million domestic, $90 million international) at the box office.

==Plot==
In 1978, narcissistic, manipulative actress Madeline Ashton performs in an awful musical version of ''[[Sweet Bird of Youth]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. She invites long-time rival Helen Sharp, an aspiring writer, backstage along with Helen's fiancé, plastic surgeon Ernest Menville. Ernest is smitten with Madeline, and breaks off his engagement with Helen to marry her. Seven years later, in 1985, Helen winds up in a psychiatric hospital after fixating upon Madeline. Obese and depressed, Helen feigns rehabilitation and is released, plotting revenge on Madeline.

Another seven years later, in 1992, Madeline lives in Beverly Hills with Ernest, but they are miserable. Madeline's acting career has faded with age, and Ernest is an alcoholic reduced to working as a [[Embalming#Specialist embalming|reconstructive mortician]]. Receiving an invitation to a party celebrating Helen's new book, Madeline rushes to a spa where she regularly receives facial treatments. Understanding Madeline's situation, the spa owner gives her the business card of Lisle Von Rhuman, a woman specializing in youth rejuvenation.

Madeline and Ernest attend the party for Helen's novel, ''Forever Young'', and discover that somehow, Helen is now slim, youthful, and beautiful. Dumbfounded and depressed by Helen's appearance, Madeline visits her young lover, but discovers he is with a woman his age. Dejected, Madeline drives to Lisle's home. Lisle is a mysterious, glamorous, wealthy socialite claiming to be 71, but looks much younger. She reveals to Madeline the secret of her beauty and youth—an expensive potion that promises eternal life and an everlasting youthful appearance. Madeline purchases and drinks the potion and is rejuvenated, regaining her beauty. As a condition of purchase, Madeline must disappear from public life after 10 years to keep the existence of the potion secret. Lisle warns Madeline to take good care of her body.

Helen seduces Ernest and convinces him to kill Madeline. When Madeline returns home, Ernest and she argue, during which Madeline falls down the stairs, breaking her neck. Believing Madeline dead, Ernest phones Helen for advice, not seeing Madeline stand and approach him with her head twisted backward. Ernest assumes she has a dislocated neck and drives her to the emergency room. Madeline is told she is technically dead, and faints. She is taken to the [[morgue]] due to her body having no pulse and a temperature below 80&amp;nbsp;°F. After rescuing Madeline, Ernest takes the sign of her "resurrection" as a miracle, returns home with Madeline, and uses his skills as a mortician to repair her body.

Helen demands information about Madeline's situation. Overhearing Helen and Ernest discussing their plot to stage Madeline's death, Madeline shoots Helen with a shotgun. Although the blast creates a hole in her abdomen, Helen survives, revealing that she drank the same potion. Fed up with the pair, Ernest prepares to leave, but Helen and Madeline convince him to do one last repair on their bodies. They realize they will need constant maintenance and scheme to have Ernest drink the potion to ensure he will always be available.

After bringing Ernest to Lisle, she offers to give him the potion free of charge in exchange for his surgical skills. Ernest refuses rather than being immortal. He pockets the potion and flees, but becomes trapped on the roof. Helen and Madeline implore Ernest to drink the potion to survive an impending fall. Ernest, realizing they only want him to drink it because they need him, refuses and drops the potion to the ground several stories below, but after falling he lands in Lisle's pool and escapes. After Lisle banishes Madeline and Helen from her group, the pair realize they must rely on each other for companionship and maintenance.

Thirty-seven years later, Madeline and Helen attend Ernest's funeral, where he is eulogized as having lived an adventurous and fulfilling life with a large family and friends. They are parodies of their former selves, with cracked, peeling paint and putty covering most of their grey and rotting flesh. Helen trips and teeters at the top of a staircase. After Madeline hesitates to help her, Helen grabs Madeline and the two tumble down the stairs, breaking to pieces. As their disembodied heads totter together, Helen sardonically asks Madeline, "Do you remember where you parked the car?"

==Production==
''Death Becomes Her'' was a technologically complex movie to make, and represented a major advancement in the use of [[computer generated imagery|computer-generated]] effects, under the pioneering direction of [[Industrial Light and Magic]].&lt;ref name="ilm.com"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ilm.com/vfx/death-becomes-her/| title=Death Becomes Her (Universal Pictures)| publisher=ilm.com| access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-08-21/features/9201170039_1_roger-rabbit-special-effects-director-robert-zemeckis| title=Special Effects, Acting Bring 'Death' to Life| author=Judd Blaise| publisher=Sun Sentinel| date=1992-08-21|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it was the first film where computer-generated skin texture was used, in the shot where Madeline resets her neck after her head is smashed with a shovel by Helen.&lt;ref name="ilm.com"/&gt; Creating the sequences where Madeline's head is dislocated and facing the wrong way around involved a combination of [[blue screen technology]], an [[animatronic]] model created by [[Amalgamated Dynamics]], and prosthetic make-up effects on Meryl Streep to create the look of a twisted neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRNVHaaUAp8| title=Death Becomes Her (1992) Vintage Bonus Clip: Meryl's Mom &amp; Special Effects (HD)| | publisher=Youtube| date=2016-06-23| access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIgJgGOEahk| title=DEATH BECOMES HER Recreating Meryl BTS Special Edition| author=Amalgamated Dynamics Inc.| publisher=Youtube| date=2015-07-25| access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The digital advancements pioneered on ''Death Becomes Her'' would be incorporated into Industrial Light and Magic's next project, ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', released by Universal only a year later. Both films shared cinematographer [[Dean Cundey]] and production designer [[Rick Carter]], in addition to ILM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/06/5-versions-of-jurassic-park-you-never-saw-97110/| title=5 Versions of 'Jurassic Park' You Never Saw| author=Drew Taylor| publisher=indiewire.com| date=2013-06-11| access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production had a fair number of mishaps. For example, in a scene where Helen Sharp and Madeline Ashton are battling with shovels, [[Meryl Streep]] accidentally cut [[Goldie Hawn]]'s face, leaving a faint scar. Streep admitted that she disliked working on a project that focused so heavily on special effects, saying:

{{cquote|My first, my last, my only. I think it's tedious. Whatever concentration you can apply to that kind of comedy is just shredded. You stand there like a piece of machinery—they should get machinery to do it. I loved how it turned out. But it's not fun to act to a lampstand. "Pretend this is Goldie, right here! Uh, no, I'm sorry, Bob, she went off the mark by five centimeters, and now her head won't match her neck!" It was like being at the dentist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,275733_4,00.html |date=2000-03-24 |title=Depth Becomes Her |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Filming locations==
The film was made entirely in [[Los Angeles]] and used several locations also frequently used in film and television, including the [[Greystone Mansion]] (Ernest's funeral home) and the [[Ebell of Los Angeles]] (Helen's book party).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ebellla.org/filming/| title=The Ebell of Los Angeles - Filming| publisher=ebellla.org| access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exterior of Madeline and Ernest's mansion is located at 1125 Oak Grove Avenue in [[San Marino, California|San Marino]], but the interior was a set built on a soundstage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=http://www.iamnotastalker.com/2017/10/13/madeline-and-ernests-mansion-from-death-becomes-her/| title=Madeline and Ernest's Mansion from 'Death Becomes Her'| publisher=iamnotastalker.com| date=2017-10-13| access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|sure=yes|date=March 2018}} The ending scene where Helen and Madeline tumble down a set of stairs outside a chapel was filmed at [[Mount St. Mary's University (Los Angeles)]] in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://moviemaps.org/locations/87| title=Movies Filmed at Mount Saint Mary's University - Chalon Campus| publisher=moviemaps.org| access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deleted scenes==
The theatrical version of ''Death Becomes Her'' omitted or shortened many scenes featured in the rough cut of the movie.&lt;ref name="SS"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.simplystreep.com/content/career/films/1992deathbecomesher.html| title=Death Becomes Her| publisher=simplystreep.com| access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=March 2018}} Robert Zemeckis decided this was needed to accelerate the pace of the film and eliminate extraneous jokes. Most dramatically, the original ending was entirely redone after test audiences reacted negatively to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/07/31/death-becomes-her-25th-anniversary-12-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-classic-comedy-6808575/| title=Death Become Her 25th Anniversary: 12 things you may not know about the classic comedy| author=Jon O'Brien| publisher=metro.co.uk| date=2017-07-31| access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ending featured Ernest, after he has fled Lisle's party, meeting a bartender ([[Tracey Ullman]]), who helps him fake his death to evade Madeline and Helen. The two women encounter Ernest and the bartender 27 years later, living happily as a retired couple.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite article| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-09/entertainment/ca-6132_1_ullman-ending| title=A look inside Hollywood and the movies.: THE VANISHING: 'Death Becomes Her' and the Lost Ullman Ending| author=David J. Fox| publisher=Los Angeles Times| date=1992-08-09| access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zemeckis thought the ending was too happy and opted for the darker ending featured in the final cut.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; Ullman was one of five actors with speaking roles in the film to be eliminated.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; Other scenes that were eliminated included one in which Madeline talks to her agent ([[Jonathan Silverman]]) and one in which Ernest removes a frozen Madeline from the kitchen freezer he has stored her in.&lt;ref name="SS"/&gt; None of the scenes have been released publicly, but sequences can still be viewed in the original theatrical trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jPuZLUY4II| title=Death Becomes Her (1992) Meryl Streep, Bruce Willis - Official Trailer (HD)| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2016-04-11| access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The score was composed by American film composer [[Alan Silvestri]], who also composed scores of other films directed by Zemeckis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 of the Most Underrated Horror Scores! |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/20063/ |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film received mixed reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Death Becomes Her|work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=1992-07-26|url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117901657.html |accessdate=2010-10-03|first=Todd|last=McCarthy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Death Becomes Her|work= [[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=1992-08-14|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,311403,00.html|accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a rating of 54% based on reviews from 28 critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death Becomes Her (1992)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/death_becomes_her/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film a 'thumbs down', commenting that while the film had great special effects, it lacked any real substance or character depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/atm/reviews.html?sec=1&amp;subsec=759|title=''Death Becomes Her'' review}}{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}[http://englishmoviereview.com/death-becomes-her-movie-review/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424070244/http://englishmoviereview.com/death-becomes-her-movie-review/ |date=2016-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's release on DVD was called "appallingly bad",&lt;ref name="Michael"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaeldvd.com.au/Reviews/DeathBecomesHer.asp|title=Death Becomes Her|publisher=Michael Demtschyna|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "horrible" and "sloppy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2000/10/12/death_becomes_her_1992_dvd_review.shtml|title=BBC - Films - review - Death Becomes Her DVD|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the quality of its transfer, which has been said to suffer from excessive grain, blur, and muted colors.&lt;ref name="Michael"/&gt; Many online DVD forum users speculated that the DVD transfer was taken from the [[Laserdisc]] edition of the film and called for a restorative release. The film was initially distributed in an open-matte, [[4:3|fullscreen]] edition with an aspect ratio of [[Aspect ratio (image)|1.33:1]] in the United States before a widescreen version with its intended ratio ([[Aspect ratio (image)|1.85:1]]) was released and subsequently distributed worldwide. The latter version has also been mistakenly labelled [[Anamorphic widescreen|anamorphic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidohenkel.com/2012/07/a-stroll-down-the-dvd-memory-lane/|title=A stroll down the DVD memory lane: Guido Henkel|publisher=Guido Henkel|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later released in North America on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] from [[Shout Factory]] on April 26, 2016.

===Box office===
The film opened at number one at the box office with $12,110,355 on the same weekend as and ahead of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Bebe's Kids]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office `Honors' Tops in a Lackluster Bunch|publisher= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1994-05-10|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-10/entertainment/ca-56005_1_weekend-box-office|accessdate=2010-12-28|first=Robert W.|last=Welkos}}&lt;/ref&gt; It went on to earn over $58.4 million domestically and $90.6 million internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=deathbecomesher.htm Box Office Mojo]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''Death Becomes Her'' has acquired a significant cult following, especially in the [[LGBT]] community.&lt;ref name="Julia Pugachevsky"&gt;{{cite article| url=http://www.newnownext.com/newnownext-style-death-becomes-her-is-ruling-our-lives-and-our-wardrobes/06/2013/| title="Death Becomes Her" Is Ruling Our Lives: NewNowNext Style| author=Julia Pugachevsky| publisher=newnownext.com| date=2013-06-21| access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' titled "The Gloriously Queer Afterlife of 'Death Becomes Her'" called the film a "gay cult classic" and "a touchstone of the queer community".&lt;ref name="Kristy Puchko"&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/08/death-becomes-her-25th-anniversary-meryl-streep-goldie-hawn-gay-classic| title=The Glorious Queer Afterlife of 'Death Becomes Her'| author=Kristy Puchko| publisher=Vanity Fair| date=2017-08-03| access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie is screened in bars during [[LGBT Pride Month|Pride Month]], while the characters of Madeline and Helen are favorites of drag performers.

Tom Campbell, an executive producer of ''RuPaul's Drag Race'', reflected on the appeal of the movie to gay audiences: {{cquote|They're fighting for beauty. They're against the system. They're also villains, but we understand their complexity. We root for the undead divas because they're trying to win a game that's rigged against them, and—to borrow an apocryphal quote from Ginger Rogers—they sort of have to do it 'backwards and in high heels.'&lt;ref name="Kristy Puchko"&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/08/death-becomes-her-25th-anniversary-meryl-streep-goldie-hawn-gay-classic| title=The Glorious Queer Afterlife of 'Death Becomes Her'| author=Kristy Puchko| publisher=Vanity Fair| date=2017-08-03| access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Escapism''' is the avoidance of unpleasant, boring, arduous, scary, or banal aspects of [[Everyday life|daily life]].&lt;ref&gt;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/escapism&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used as a term to define the actions people take to help relieve persistent feelings of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or general [[sadness]].

==Perceptions==
Entire industries have sprung up to foster a growing tendency of people to remove themselves from the rigors of daily life – especially into the digital world.&lt;ref&gt;G. Kainer, ''Grace and the Great Controversy'' (2010) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Many activities that are normal parts of a healthy existence (e.g., eating, sleeping, exercise, sexual activity) can also become avenues of escapism when taken to extremes or out of proper context; and as a result the word "escapism" often carries a negative connotation, suggesting that escapists are unhappy, with an inability or unwillingness to connect meaningfully with the world and to take necessary action.&lt;ref&gt;D. Baggett et al, ''C. S. Lewis as Philosopher'' (2009) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the [[OED]] defined escapism as "The tendency to seek, or the practice of seeking, distraction from what normally has to be endured".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in T. A. Shipley, ''The Road to Middle-Earth'' (1992) p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many challenge the idea that escapism is fundamentally and exclusively negative. [[C. S. Lewis]] was fond of humorously remarking that the usual enemies of escape were jailers;&lt;ref&gt;G. Kainer, ''Grace and the Great Controversy'' (2010) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and considered that used in moderation escapism could serve both to refresh and to expand the imaginative powers.&lt;ref&gt;D. Baggett et al, ''C. S. Lewis as Philosopher'' (2009) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] argued for escapism in fantasy literature as the creative expression of reality within a secondary (imaginative) world, (but also emphasised that they required an element of horror in them, if they were not to be 'mere escapism').&lt;ref&gt;T. F. Nicolay, ''Tolkien and the Modernists'' (2014) p. 79 and p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terry Pratchett]] considered that the twentieth century had seen the development over time of a more positive view of escapist literature.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Pratchett &amp; Stephen Briggs, ''The Discworld Companion'' (2012) p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from literature, [[music]] has been seen and valued as an artistic medium of escape, too.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Dorschel]], ''Der Welt abhanden kommen. Über musikalischen Eskapismus''. In: ''Merkur'' 66 (2012), no. 2, pp. 135–142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological escapes==
[[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] considered a quota of escapist [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] a necessary element in the life of humans: "[T]hey cannot subsist on the scanty satisfaction they can extort from reality. 'We simply cannot do without auxiliary constructions', [[Theodor Fontane]] once said".&lt;ref&gt;S, Freud, ''Introductory lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL1) p. 419&lt;/ref&gt; His followers saw rest and wish fulfilment (in small measures) as useful tools in adjusting to traumatic upset;&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946), p. 554&lt;/ref&gt; while later psychologists have highlighted the role of vicarious distractions in shifting unwanted [[Mood (psychology)|moods]], especially anger and sadness.&lt;ref&gt;D. Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1996) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if permanent residence is taken up in some such [[John Steiner (psychoanalyst)#Psychic retreat|psychic retreats]], the results will often be negative and even pathological.&lt;ref&gt;R. Britton, ''Belief and Imagination'' (2003) p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs cause some forms of escapism which can occur when certain mind-altering drugs are taken which make the participant forget the reality of where they are or what they are meant to be doing.

==Escapist societies==
Some social critics warn of attempts by the powers that control society to provide means of escapism instead of actually bettering the condition of the people – what [[Juvenal]] called “bread and the [[Gladiatorial games|games]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal, ''The Sixteen Satires'' (1982) p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; Escapist societies appear often in literature. ''[[The Time Machine]]'' depicts the Eloi, a lackadaisical, insouciant race of the future, and the horror their happy lifestyle belies. The novel subtly criticizes [[capitalism]], or at least classism, as a means of escape. Escapist societies are common in dystopian novels; for example, in the ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' society, television and "seashell radios" are used to escape a life with strict regulations and the threat of a forthcoming war. In science fiction media escapism is often depicted as an extension of social evolution, as society becomes detached from physical reality and processing into a virtual one, examples include the virtual world of Oz in the 2009 Japanese animated science fiction anime ''[[Summer Wars]]'' and the game "Society" in the 2009 American science fiction film ''[[Gamer (2009 film)|Gamer]]'', a play on the real-life [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]] game ''[[Second Life]]''. Other escapist societies in literature include ''The Reality Bug'' by D. J. McHale, where an entire civilization leaves their world in ruin while they 'jump' into their perfect realities. The aim of the anti hero becomes a quest to make their realities seemingly less perfect in order to regain control over their dying planet.

Social philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]] wrote that utopias and images of fulfilment, however regressive they might be, also included an impetus for a radical social change. According to Bloch, social justice could not be realized without seeing things fundamentally differently. Something that is mere "daydreaming" or "escapism" from the viewpoint of a technological-rational society might be a seed for a new and more humane social order, as it can be seen as an "immature, but honest substitute for revolution".

==Escape scale==

The Norwegian psychologist Frode Stenseng has presented a dualistic model of escapism in relation to different types of activity engagements. He discusses the paradox that the flow state ([[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi]]) resembles psychological states obtainable through actions such as drug abuse, sexual masochism, and suicide ideation ([[Roy Baumeister|Baumeister]]). Accordingly, he deduces that the state of escape can have both positive and negative meanings and outcomes. Stenseng argues that there exist two forms of escapism with different affective outcomes dependent on the motivational focus that lies behind the immersion in the activity. Escapism in the form of self-suppression stems from motives to run away from unpleasant thoughts, self-perceptions, and emotions, whereas self-expansion stems from motives to gain positive experiences through the activity and to discover new aspects of self. Stenseng has developed the "escape scale" to measure self-suppression and self-expansion in people´s favorite activities, such as sports, arts, and gaming. Empirical investigations of the model have shown that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stenseng|first1=Frode|last2=Rise|first2=Jostein|last3=Kraft|first3=Pål|title=Activity Engagement as Escape from Self: The Role of Self-Suppression and Self-Expansion|journal=Leisure Sciences: An Interdisciplinary Journal|date=2012|volume=34|issue=1|pages=19–38|doi=10.1080/01490400.2012.633849|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490400.2012.633849}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the two dimensions are distinctively different with regard to affective outcomes 
* some individuals are more prone to engage through one type of escapism 
* situational levels of well-being affect the type of escapism that becomes dominant at a specific time

==During the Great Depression== 
[[Alan Brinkley]], author of ''Culture and Politics in the Great Depression'', presents how escapism became the new trend for dealing with the hardships created by [[Great Depression|the stock market crash in 1929]]: magazines, radio and movies, all were aimed to help people mentally escape from the mass poverty and economic downturn. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, which became hugely popular during the 1930s, was said to have pictures that give "no indication that there was such a thing as depression; most of the pictures are of bathing beauties and ship launchings and building projects and sports heroes – of almost anything but poverty and unemployment”. Famous director [[Preston Sturges]] aimed to validate this notion by creating a film called ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]''. The film ends with a group of poor destitute men in jail watching a comedic [[Mickey Mouse]] [[cartoon]] that ultimately lifts their spirits. Sturges aims to point out how "foolish and vain and self-indulgent" it would be to make a film about suffering. Therefore, movies of the time more often than not focused on comedic plot lines that distanced people emotionally from the horrors that were occurring all around them. These films "consciously, deliberately set out to divert people from their problems", but it also diverted them from the problems of those around them.&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley, Alan. Culture and Politics in the Great Depression. Waco, Tx: Markham Press Fund, 1999. http://www.uvm.edu/~pblackme/Brinkley.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fantastic Four''' is a fictional [[superhero]] team appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The group debuted in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|The Fantastic Four]]'' #1 ([[cover date]]d Nov. 1961), which helped to usher in a new level of realism in the [[mass media|medium]]. The Fantastic Four was the first superhero team created by editor/co-plotter [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]], who developed a collaborative approach to creating comics with this title that they would use from then on.

The four individuals traditionally associated with the Fantastic Four, who gained [[superpower (ability)|superpowers]] after exposure to [[cosmic ray]]s during a scientific mission to outer space, are [[Mister Fantastic]] (Reed Richards), a scientific genius and the leader of the group, who can stretch his body into incredible lengths and shapes; the [[Invisible Woman|Invisible Girl]] (Susan "Sue" Storm; later "Invisible Woman"), who eventually married Reed, who can render herself invisible and later project powerful invisible force fields; the [[Human Torch]] (Johnny Storm), Sue's younger brother, who can generate flames, surround himself with them and fly; and the monstrous [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] (Ben Grimm), their grumpy but benevolent friend, a former college football star and Reed's college roommate as well as a good pilot, who possesses tremendous superhuman strength, durability, and endurance due to the nature of his stone-like flesh.

Since their original 1961 introduction, the Fantastic Four have been portrayed as a somewhat dysfunctional, yet loving, family. Breaking convention with other comic book archetypes of the time, they would squabble and hold grudges both deep and petty and eschewed anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status. The team is also well known for its recurring encounters with characters such as the villainous monarch [[Doctor Doom]], the planet-devouring [[Galactus]], the sea-dwelling prince [[Namor]], the spacefaring [[Silver Surfer]] and the shape-changing alien [[Skrull]]s.

The Fantastic Four have been adapted into [[mass media|other media]], including four [[animated series]] and four [[Fantastic Four in film|live-action films]].

==Publication history==
===Origins===
Apocryphal legend has it that in 1961, longtime [[magazine]] and [[comic book]] [[publishing|publisher]] [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] was playing golf with either [[Jack Liebowitz]] or [[Irwin Donenfeld]] of rival company [[DC Comics]], then known as National Periodical Publications, &lt;!--also known as name is mentioned here because Stan Lee says "National Comics" in quote directly below this paragraph--&gt; and that the top executive bragged about DC's success with the new superhero team the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;That DC all-star superhero team had debuted in ''The Brave and the Bold'' #28 ([[cover-date]]d Feb. 1960) before going on to its own hit title (issue #1 cover-dated Nov. 1960).&lt;/ref&gt; While film producer and comics historian [[Michael Uslan]] has debunked the particulars of that story,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Uslan, in a letter published in ''Alter Ego'' #43 (December 2004), pp. 43–44, writes: "Irwin Donenfeld said he never played golf with Goodman, so the story is untrue. I heard this story more than a couple of times while sitting in the lunchroom at DC's 909 Third Avenue and 75 Rockefeller Plaza office as Sol Harrison and [production chief] Jack Adler were schmoozing with some of us... who worked for DC during our college summers.... [T]he way I heard the story from Sol was that Goodman was playing with one of the heads of Independent News, not DC Comics (though DC ''owned'' Independent News). ... As the distributor of DC Comics, this man certainly knew all the sales figures and was in the best position to tell this tidbit to Goodman. ... Of course, Goodman would want to be playing golf with this fellow and be in his good graces. ... Sol worked closely with Independent News' top management over the decades and would have gotten this story straight from the horse's mouth."&lt;/ref&gt; Goodman, a publishing trend-follower, aware of the JLA's strong sales, did direct his comics editor, [[Stan Lee]], to create a comic-book series about a team of superheroes. According to Lee, writing in 1974, "Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most. It was a book called ''The'' {{sic}} ''Justice League of America'' and it was composed of a team of superheroes. ... 'If the Justice League is selling', spoke he, 'why don't we put out a comic book that features a team of superheroes?'"&lt;ref name="Origins"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Lee | first=Stan | authorlink=Stan Lee | title=Origins of Marvel Comics | publisher= [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]/[[Marvel Fireside Books|Fireside Books]]&lt;!--Book predates publisher's change to ampersand in corporate name--&gt; | date=September 1974|location= New York, New York| isbn=978-0-671-21863-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|16}}

Lee, who had served as editor-in-chief and art director of Marvel Comics and its predecessor companies, [[Timely Comics]] and [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], for two decades, found that the medium had become creatively restrictive. Determined "to carve a real career for myself in the nowhere world of comic books",&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{Cite book | last=Lee | first=Stan | authorlink=Stan Lee | title=Origins of Marvel Comics | publisher= [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]/[[Marvel Fireside Books|Fireside Books]]&lt;!--Book predates publisher's change to ampersand in corporate name--&gt; | date=September 1974|location= New York, New York| isbn=978-0-671-21863-8 | quote=[My wife] Joan was commenting about the fact that after 20 years of producing comics I was still writing television material, advertising copy and newspaper features in my spare time. She wondered why I didn't put as much effort and creativity into the comics as I seemed to be putting into my other freelance endeavors. ...[H]er little dissertation made me suddenly realize that it was time to start concentrating on what I was doing — to carve a real career for myself in the nowhere world of comic books.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee concluded that, "For just this once, I would do the type of story I myself would enjoy reading.... And the characters would be the kind of characters I could personally relate to: they'd be flesh and blood, they'd have their faults and foibles, they'd be fallible and feisty, and — most important of all — inside their colorful, costumed booties they'd still have feet of clay."&lt;ref name="Origins"/&gt;{{Rp|17}}

Lee said he created a synopsis for the first Fantastic Four story that he gave to [[penciller]] [[Jack Kirby]], who then drew the entire story. Kirby turned in his penciled art pages to Lee, who added dialogue and captions. This approach to creating comics, which became known as the "[[Marvel Method]]", worked so well for Lee and Kirby that they used it from then on; the Marvel Method became standard for the company within a year.&lt;ref name="Daniels"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Daniels | first=Les | authorlink=Les Daniels | title=Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics | publisher=[[Abrams Books|Harry N. Abrams]]| year=1993|location= New York, New York|isbn=0-8109-8146-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|87}}

Kirby recalled events somewhat differently. Challenged with Lee's version of events in a 1990 interview, Kirby responded: "I would say that's an outright lie",&lt;ref name="GG"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Groth | first=Gary | title=Interview III: 'I've never done anything halfheartedly' | journal=[[The Comics Journal]] | issue=134|publisher=Fantagraphics Books |date=February 1990|location= Seattle, Washington}} Reprinted in {{Cite book | editor-last=George | editor-first=Milo | title=The Comics Journal Library Volume 1: Jack Kirby | publisher=Fantagraphics Books | date=May 2002|location= Seattle, Washington | isbn=1-56097-434-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|39}} although the interviewer, [[Gary Groth]], notes that this statement needs to be viewed with caution.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Groth explains in his 2002 introduction to the interview that Kirby's state of mind needs to be taken into consideration when evaluating certain statements within the interview. Kirby was involved in an acrimonious dispute with Marvel Comics regarding the return of his artwork, and his relationship with Lee had deteriorated, in part due to this dispute but also due to Lee's public statements through the years, which Kirby saw as diminishing his role. Groth states: "Lee's contribution is a matter for endless speculation, but most observers and historians consider Kirby's claims here to be excessive."&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby claims he came up with the idea for the Fantastic Four in Marvel's offices, and that Lee had merely added the dialogue after the story had been pencilled.&lt;ref name="GG"/&gt;{{Rp|38}} Kirby also sought to establish, more credibly and on numerous occasions, that the visual elements of the strip were his conceptions. He regularly pointed to a team he had created for rival publisher DC Comics in the 1950s, the [[Challengers of the Unknown]]. "[I]f you notice the uniforms, they're the same... I always give them a skintight uniform with a belt... the Challengers and the FF have a minimum of decoration. And of course, the Thing's skin is a kind of decoration, breaking up the monotony of the blue uniform."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite interview | last=Kirby | first=Jack | subjectlink=Jack Kirby | interviewer=Tim Skelly | title=Interview II: 'I created an army of characters, and now my connection to them is lost' | publisher=[[WNUR-FM]]|location= Evanston, Illinois| work=The Great Electric Bird | date=May 14, 1971}} Transcribed and published in ''The Nostalgia Journal'' #27. Reprinted in George, ''The Comics Journal Library''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|4}} The chest insignia of a "4" within a circle, however, was designed by Lee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Clothes Make the Man – and the Super-hero Team!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| page= 14|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|quote= Stan himself at some point played around by drawing a number of possible chest insignias, as seen at left, before settling on the simple number '4' in a circle ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characters wear no uniforms in the first two issues.

Given the conflicting statements, outside commentators have found it hard to identify with precise detail who created the Fantastic Four. Although Stan Lee's typed synopsis for the Fantastic Four exists, Earl Wells, writing in ''The Comics Journal'', points out that its existence does not assert its place in the creation: "[W]e have no way of knowing of whether Lee wrote the synopsis after a discussion with Kirby in which Kirby supplied most of the ideas".&lt;ref name="WE"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Wells | first=Earl | title=Once and For All, Who Was the Author of Marvel | journal=The Comics Journal | issue=181 | date=October 1995|location= Seattle, Washington}} Reprinted in George, ''The Comics Journal Library''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|78}} Comics historian [[R. C. Harvey]] believes that the Fantastic Four was a furtherance of the work Kirby had been doing previously, and so "more likely Kirby's creations than Lee's".&lt;ref name="RC"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Harvey | first=R. C. | authorlink=R. C. Harvey | title=What Jack Kirby Did | journal=The Comics Journal | issue=167 | date=April 1994|location= Seattle, Washington}} Reprinted in George, ''The Comics Journal Library''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|69}} But Harvey notes that the [[Marvel Method]] of collaboration allowed each man to claim credit,&lt;ref name="RC"/&gt;{{Rp|68}} and that Lee's dialogue added to the direction the team took.&lt;ref name="RC"/&gt;{{Rp|69}} Wells argues that it was Lee's contributions which set the framework within which Kirby worked, and this made Lee "more responsible".&lt;ref name="WE"/&gt;{{Rp|85}} Comics historian [[Mark Evanier]], a studio assistant to Jack Kirby in the 1970s, says that the considered opinion of Lee and Kirby's contemporaries was "that ''Fantastic Four'' was created by Stan and Jack. No further division of credit seemed appropriate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Evanier|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Evanier| title=Kirby: King of Comics|publisher=[[Abrams Books]]|year=2008|location= New York, New York| isbn=0-8109-9447-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|122}}

===1961–1970s===
The release of ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|The Fantastic Four]]'' #1 (Nov. 1961) was an unexpected success. Lee had felt ready to leave the comics field at the time, but the positive response to ''Fantastic Four'' persuaded him to stay on.&lt;ref name="century"/&gt; The title began to receive fan mail&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 84|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= It did not take long for editor Stan Lee to realize that ''The Fantastic Four'' was a hit...the flurry of fan letters all pointed to the FF's explosive popularity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lee started printing the letters in a letter column with issue #3. Also with the third issue, Lee created the hyperbolic slogan "The Greatest Comic Magazine in the World!!" With the following issue, the slogan was changed to "The World's Greatest Comic Magazine!" and became a fixture on the issue covers into the 1990s,&lt;ref name="Daniels"/&gt;{{Rp|87}} and on numerous covers in the 2000s.

Issue #4 (May 1962) reintroduced [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]],&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 86: "Stan Lee and Jack Kirbuy reintroduced one of Marvel's most popular Golden Age heroes – Namor, the Sub-Mariner."&lt;/ref&gt; an aquatic [[antihero]] who was a star character of Marvel's earliest iteration, [[Timely Comics]], during the late 1930s and 1940s period that historians and fans call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age of Comics]]. Issue #5 (July 1962) introduced the team's most frequent nemesis, [[Doctor Doom]].&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 86: "The introduction of Dr. Doom signaled a slight shift in direction for Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. At last they were moving away from their monster-book formulas to embrace the super hero genre. Dr. Doom was their first real attempt to create an enduring super villain."&lt;/ref&gt; These earliest issues were published bimonthly. With issue #16 (July 1963), the cover title dropped its ''The'' and became simply ''Fantastic Four''.

While the early stories were complete narratives, the frequent appearances of these two antagonists, Doom and Namor, in subsequent issues indicated the creation of a long narrative by Lee and Kirby that extended over months. According to comics historian [[Les Daniels]], "only narratives that ran to several issues would be able to contain their increasingly complex ideas".&lt;ref name="Daniels"/&gt;{{Rp|88}} During its creators' lengthy run, the series produced many acclaimed storylines and characters that have become central to Marvel, including the hidden race of alien-human genetic experiments, the [[Inhumans]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first= Brian|last= Cronin|url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/09/18/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-261/|title= A Year of Cool Comics – Day 261|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|date= September 18, 2010|accessdate= September 29, 2010 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101123190418/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/09/18/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-261/|archivedate=November 23, 2010 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeFalco111"&gt;DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 111: "The Inhumans, a lost race that diverged from humankind 25,000 years ago and became genetically enhanced."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Brian|last= Cronin|url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/09/19/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-262/|title= A Year of Cool Comics – Day 262|publisher= Comic Book Resources|date= September 19, 2010| accessdate= September 29, 2010|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110708181411/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/09/19/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-262/|archivedate=July 8, 2011 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; an African king who would be mainstream comics' first black superhero;&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 117: Stan Lee wanted to do his part by creating the first black super hero.

Marvel filed for a [[trademark]] for "Fantastic Four" in 1967 and the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] issued the registration in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://trademark.markify.com/trademarks/uspto/fantastic+four/72276841|title= Fantastic Four|publisher= Markify|accessdate= May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jim Steranko]] also contributed some covers during this time. A short-lived series starring the team, ''Giant-Size Super-Stars'', began in May 1974 and changed its title to ''Giant-Size Fantastic Four'' with issue #2.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth issue introduced [[Jamie Madrox]], a character who later became part of the [[X-Men]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 168: "New Marvel writer Chris Claremont and artist John Buscema introduced Madrox the Multiple Man, a mutant who could duplicate his own body over and over."&lt;/ref&gt; ''Giant-Size Fantastic Four'' was canceled with issue #6 (Oct. 1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb series|id= 2169|title= Giant-Size Fantastic Four}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roy Thomas and George Pérez crafted a [[metafiction]]al story for ''Fantastic Four'' #176 (Nov. 1976) in which the [[Impossible Man]] visited the offices of Marvel Comics and [[List of comics creators appearing in comics|met numerous comics creators]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 176: "In a venture into metafictional comedy, the mischievous Impossible Man visited the Marvel offices, where he met his creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, as well as the collaborators on his current story, writer Roy Thomas and artist George Pérez."&lt;/ref&gt; Marv Wolfman and [[Keith Pollard]] crafted a multi-issue storyline involving the son of Doctor Doom which culminated in issue #200 (Nov. 1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Martini|first = Frank|title = Marv Wolfman's Bicentennial Battles|journal = [[Back Issue!]]|issue = 69|pages = 44–47|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date = December 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] joined the title with issue #209 (Aug. 1979), doing pencil breakdowns for Sinnott to finish.

===1980s and 1990s===
[[Bill Mantlo]] briefly followed Wolfman as writer of the series and wrote a crossover with ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #42 (May 1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 113|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= In the conclusion to a tale that had begun in the pages of ''Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #42 (May), writer [Bill] Mantlo and artist John Byrne had the latest incarnation of the Frightful Four face off against their Fantastic counterparts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Bill Mantlo|Mantlo, Bill]]|penciller= [[Mike Zeck|Zeck, Mike]]|inker= [[Jim Mooney|Mooney, Jim]]|story= Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death!|title= [[The Spectacular Spider-Man|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man]]|issue= 42|date= May 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|inker= [[Joe Sinnott|Sinnott, Joe]]|story= When A Spider-Man Comes Calling!|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 218|date= May 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byrne wrote and drew a giant-sized Fantastic Four promotional comic for [[Coca-Cola]], which was rejected by Coca-Cola as being too violent and published as ''Fantastic Four'' #220–221 (July–Aug. 1980) instead.&lt;ref name="Back38"&gt;{{cite journal| last= Powers|first= Tom|date= February 2010|title= John Byrne’s Fantastic Four: The World’s Greatest Family Magazine!|journal= Back Issue!|issue= 38|pages= 3–22|publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Doug Moench]] and penciller [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] then took over for 10 issues. With issue #232 (July 1981), the aptly titled "Back to the Basics",&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 200: "John Byrne went back to basics with the ''Fantastic Four'' and evoked the title's early days of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby."&lt;/ref&gt; Byrne began his run as writer, penciller and inker, the last under the [[pseudonym]] Bjorn Heyn for this issue only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/35487/|title=GCD :: Issue :: Fantastic Four #232 [Direct Edition]|website=www.comics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byrne revitalized the slumping title with his run.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;{{Rp|265}} Originally, Byrne was slated to write with Sienkiewicz providing the art. Sienkiewicz left to do ''[[Moon Knight]]'', and Byrne subsequently became writer, artist, and inker. Various editors were assigned to the comic; eventually [[Bob Budiansky]] became the regular editor. Byrne told [[Jim Shooter]] that he could not work with Budiansky, although they ultimately continued to work together. In 2006, Byrne said "that's my paranoia. I look back and I think that was Shooter trying to force me off the book". Byrne left following issue #293 (Aug. 1986) in the middle of a story arc, explaining he could not recapture the fun he had previously had on the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Cooke | first=Jon B. |author2=Eric Nolen-Weathington | title=Modern Masters Volume Seven: John Byrne | publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing | year=2006|location= Raleigh, North Carolina| pages=42–44 | isbn=978-1-893905-56-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Byrne's changes was making the Invisible Girl into the Invisible Woman:&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 221: "After freeing herself from the Psycho-Man's control, Susan changed her name from the Invisible Girl to the Invisible Woman."&lt;/ref&gt; assertive and confident. During this period, fans came to recognize that she was quite powerful, whereas previously, she had been primarily seen as a superpowered mother and wife in the tradition of television moms like those played by [[Donna Reed]] and [[Florence Henderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://fantasticfour.ugo.com/?cur=jessica-alba&amp;gallery=true|title= Jessica Alba – Fantastic Four Girls|publisher= [[UGO]]|accessdate= March 6, 2009|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080406003917/http://fantasticfour.ugo.com/?cur=jessica-alba&amp;gallery=true|archivedate=April 6, 2008 |deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byrne staked new directions in the characters' personal lives, having the married Sue Storm and Reed Richards suffer a miscarriage and the Thing quitting the Fantastic Four, with [[She-Hulk]] being recruited as his long-term replacement. He also re-emphasized the family dynamic which he felt the series had drifted away from after the Lee/Kirby run, commenting that, "''[[Family]]''—and not ''[[dysfunctional family]]''—is the central, key element to the FF. It is an absolutely vital dynamic between the characters." [emphases in original]&lt;ref name="Back38"/&gt;

Byrne was followed by a quick succession of writers: [[Roger Stern]], [[Tom DeFalco]], and [[Roy Thomas]]. [[Steve Englehart]] took over as writer for issues 304–332 (except #320). The title had been struggling, so Englehart decided to make radical changes. He felt the title had become stale with the normal makeup of Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny, so in issue #308 Reed and Sue retired and were replaced with the Thing's new girlfriend, [[Sharon Ventura]], and Johnny Storm's former love, Crystal. The changes increased readership through issue #321. At this point, Marvel made decisions about another Englehart comic, ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'', that he disagreed with, and in protest he changed his byline to S.F.X. Englehart (S.F.X. is the abbreviation for Simple Sound Effects). In issue #326, Englehart was told to bring Reed and Sue back and undo the other changes he had made. This caused Englehart to take his name entirely off the book. He used the pseudonym John Harkness, which he had created years before for work he didn't want to be associated with. According to Englehart, the run from #326 through his last issue, #332, was "one of the most painful stretches of [his] career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.steveenglehart.com/Comics/Fantastic%20Four%20304-321.html |title=''Fantastic Four'' 304–332 |last=Englehart |authorlink=Steve Englehart |first=Steve |publisher=SteveEnglehart.com |pages=1–3 |accessdate=March 9, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GwNG9Uvq?url=http://www.steveenglehart.com/Comics/Fantastic%20Four%20304-321.html |archivedate=May 28, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer-artist [[Walt Simonson]] took over as writer with #334 (December 1989), and three issues later began [[penciller|pencilling]] and [[inker|inking]] as well. With brief inking exceptions, two fill-in issues, and a three-issue stint drawn by [[Arthur Adams (comics)|Arthur Adams]],&lt;ref name="Manning252"&gt;Manning, Matthew K. "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 252: "Spider-Man, the Hulk, Wolverine, and Ghost Rider were tricked into forming a new Fantastic Four...Written by Walter Simonson with art by Arthur Adams, this new FF found themselves locked in battle with the Mole Man."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cowsill, Alan "1990s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 186: "Take Spidey, Ghost Rider, Wolverine, and the Hulk, add a script by Walt Simonson and illustrations by Art Adams, and the result is one of the best Marvel comics of the decade."&lt;/ref&gt; Simonson remained in all three positions through #354 (July 1991).

Simonson, who had been writing the team comic ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'', had gotten approval for Reed and Sue to join that team after Engelhart had written them out of ''Fantastic Four''. Yet by ''The Avengers'' #300, where they were scheduled to join the team, Simonson was told the characters were returning to ''Fantastic Four''. This led to Simonson quitting ''The Avengers'' after that issue. Shortly afterward, he was offered the job of writing ''Fantastic Four''. Having already prepared a number of stories involving the Avengers with Reed and Sue in the lineup, he then rewrote these for ''Fantastic Four''. Simonson later recalled that working on ''Fantastic Four'' allowed him the latitude to use original Avengers members [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Iron Man]], which he had been precluded from using in ''The Avengers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Nolen-Weathington | first=Eric | title=Modern Masters Volume Eight: Walter Simonson | publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing | year=2006|location= Raleigh, North Carolina| page=66 | isbn=978-1-893905-64-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ILopomw3UpMC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=%22fantastic+four%22+Steve+Englehart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After another fill-in, the regular team of writer and Marvel editor-in-chief [[Tom DeFalco]], penciller [[Paul Ryan (cartoonist)|Paul Ryan]] and inker Dan Bulanadi took over, with Ryan self-inking beginning with #360 (Jan. 1992). That team, with the very occasional different inker, continued for years through #414 (July 1996). DeFalco nullified the Storm-Masters marriage by [[retroactive continuity|retconning]] that the alien Skrull Empire had kidnapped the real Masters and replaced her with a spy named [[Lyja]]. Once discovered, Lyja, who herself had fallen for Storm, helped the Fantastic Four rescue Masters. Ventura departed after being further mutated by Doctor Doom. Although some fans were not pleased with DeFalco's run on ''Fantastic Four'', calling him "The Great Satan", the title's sales increased over the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=12309|title= Brand New (May) Day: DeFalco talks ''Amazing Spider-Girl''|last= Manning|first= Shaun|date= January 15, 2008|publisher= Comic Book Resources|accessdate= March 10, 2009|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6GwNfwyT3?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=12309|archivedate= May 28, 2013|deadurl= no|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other key developments included Franklin Richards being sent into the future and returning as a teenager; the return of Reed's time-traveling father, Nathaniel, who is revealed to be the father of time-travelling villain [[Kang the Conqueror]] and Reed's apparent death at the hands of a seemingly mortally wounded Doctor Doom.&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 265: "In this issue penned by Tom DeFalco and penciled by Paul Ryan, Dr. Doom...managed to lure Reed Richards to him and seemingly ended both of their lives"&lt;/ref&gt; It would be two years before DeFalco resurrected the two characters, revealing that their "deaths" were orchestrated by the supervillain [[Hyperstorm]].

The ongoing series was canceled with issue #416 (Sept. 1996) and relaunched with vol. 2, #1 (Nov. 1996) as part of the multi-series "[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]" [[Crossover (comics)|crossover]] story arc. The yearlong volume retold the team's first adventures in a more contemporary style,&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 280: "Jim Lee both wrote and drew this Heroes Reborn relaunch title with the help of fellow scripter Brandon Choi."&lt;/ref&gt; and set in a parallel universe. Following the end of that experiment, ''Fantastic Four'' was relaunched with vol. 3, #1 (Jan. 1998). Initially by the team of writer [[Scott Lobdell]] and penciller [[Alan Davis]],&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 288: "Writer Scott Lobdell rearranged his X-schedule to try his hand at writing a different team of Marvel heroes in this new Heroes Reborn series. It was drawn by Alan Davis."&lt;/ref&gt; it went after three issues to writer [[Chris Claremont]] (co-writing with Lobdell for #4–5) and penciller [[Salvador Larroca]]; this team enjoyed a long run through issue #32 (Aug. 2000).

===2000s===
[[File:Fantastic Four (Marvel Comics characters).jpg|upright|thumb|Promotional art for ''Fantastic Four: The Lost Adventure'' #1 (February 2008) by [[Jack Kirby]]]]
Following the run of Claremont, Lobdell and Larroca, [[Carlos Pacheco]] took over as penciller and co-writer, first with [[Rafael Marín]], then with Marín and [[Jeph Loeb]]. This series began using dual numbering, as if the original ''Fantastic Four'' series had continued unbroken, with issue #42 / #471 (June 2001). At the time, the Marvel Comics series begun in the 1960s, such as ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', were given such dual numbering on the front cover, with the present-day volume's numbering alongside the numbering from the original series. After issue #70 / #499 (Aug. 2003), the title reverted to its original vol. 1 numbering with issue #500 (Sept. 2003).

[[Karl Kesel]] succeeded Loeb as co-writer with issue #51 / #480 (March 2002), and after a few issues with temporary teams, [[Mark Waid]] took over as writer with #60 / 489 (October 2002) with artist [[Mike Wieringo]] with Marvel releasing a promotional variant edition of their otherwise $2.25 debut issue at the price of nine cents US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/fantfou6.htm#S462|publisher=  The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators|title= ''Fantastic Four'' (III) (1998–2003)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Mark Waid|Waid, Mark]]|penciller= [[Mike Wieringo|Wieringo, Mike]]|inker= [[Karl Kesel|Kesel, Karl]]|story= Inside Out|title= Fantastic Four|volume= 3|issue= 60|date= October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pencillers [[Mark Buckingham]], Casey Jones, and Howard Porter variously contributed through issue #524 (May 2005), with a handful of issues by other teams also during this time. Writer [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and penciller [[Mike McKone]] did issues #527–541 (July 2005 – Nov. 2006), with [[Dwayne McDuffie]] taking over as writer the following issue, and [[Paul Pelletier]] succeeding McKone beginning with #544 (May 2007).

As a result of the events of the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" company-crossover storyline, the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] temporarily replaced Reed and Susan Richards on the team.

In November 2011, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Fantastic Four and of Marvel Comics, the company published the 100-page ''Fantastic Four'' #600 (cover-dated Jan. 2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/899879/|title=GCD :: Issue :: Fantastic Four #600|website=www.comics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which returned the title to its original numbering and featured the return of the Human Torch. It revealed the fate of the character of Johnny Storm after issue #587, showing that while he did in fact die, he was resurrected to fight as a gladiator for the entertainment of Annihilus. Storm later formed a resistance force called Light Brigade and defeated Annihilus.&lt;ref name="FF600" /&gt;

Although it was launched as a continuation of the ''Fantastic Four'' title, ''FF'' continues publication as a separate series. Starting with issue #12, the title focuses upon the youthful members of the Future Foundation, including Franklin and Valeria Richards.

In the graphic novel ''Fantastic Four:  Season One'', the Fantastic Four is given an updated origin story set in the present day instead of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="nyt-20120311"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2012-03-11/hardcover-graphic-books/list.html |title=Best Sellers – ''The New York Times'' – Hardcover Graphic Books |date=March 11, 2012 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |accessdate=May 12, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GwRBJqRP?url=http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2012-03-11/hardcover-graphic-books/list.html |archivedate=May 28, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hardcover compilation debuted at number four on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for graphic novels.&lt;ref name="nyt-20120311"/&gt;

==Spinoffs==
Ancillary titles and features spun off from the flagship series include the 1970s quarterly ''Giant-Size Fantastic Four'' and the 1990s ''Fantastic Four Unlimited'' and ''Fantastic Four Unplugged''; ''[[Fantastic Force]]'', an 18-issue spinoff (November 1994 – April 1996) featuring an adult Franklin Richards, from a different timeline, as Psi-Lord. A 12-issue series ''Fantastic Four: The World's Greatest Comics Magazine'' ran in 2001, paying homage to [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]'s legendary run. A spinoff title ''[[Marvel Knights 4]]'' (April 2004 – August 2006) was written by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] and initially illustrated by [[Steve McNiven]]&lt;ref&gt;Manning "2000s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 321: "Playwright Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and artist Steve McNiven focused on the family dynamic that holds the Fantastic Four together in this new ongoing series."&lt;/ref&gt; in his first Marvel work. As well, there have been numerous [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] featuring the group.

In 1996, Marvel launched ''[[Fantastic Four 2099]]''. The series was part of the company's [[Marvel 2099]] imprint, which explored an alternate future of the Marvel Universe. The four protagonists inexplicably find themselves in 2099, with the world believing them to be clones of the original members of the Fantastic Four. The series ran for 8 issues (Jan. – Aug. 1996), serving as a companion to ''[[Doom 2099]]''—an original Marvel 2099 title which featured an individual claiming to be the original [[Doctor Doom|Victor von Doom]].

In 2004, Marvel launched ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]''. As part of the company's [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint, the series re-imagined the team as teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;Manning "2000s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 320: "Brian Michael Bendis, Mark Millar, and Adam Kubert reexamined Marvel's first family, creating this alternate version of the Fantastic Four."&lt;/ref&gt; The series ran for 60 issues (Feb. 2004 – Feb. 2009). In 2008, Marvel also launched ''Marvel Adventures: Fantastic Four'', an out-of-continuity series aimed at younger readers.

Although it was launched by Marvel as a continuation of the Fantastic Four title in 2011, ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' continued publication as a separate series after the regular series resumed in 2012. From issues #12, the title focused upon the youthful members of the Future Foundation, including Franklin and Valeria Richards.  A second volume was launched as part of [[Marvel NOW!]] by [[Matt Fraction]] and [[Mike Allred]] depicting a substitute Fantastic Four team starring [[Ant-Man|Scott Lang]], [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], [[She-Hulk]], and Ms. Thing.

===The Human Torch solo===
The Human Torch was given a solo strip in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' in 1962 in order to bolster sales of the title.&lt;ref name="Daniels"/&gt;{{Rp|98}} The series began in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #101 (October 1962), in 12- to 14-page stories plotted by Lee and initially scripted by his brother, [[Larry Lieber]], and drawn by penciller Kirby and inker [[Dick Ayers]].

Here, Johnny was seen living with his older sister, Susan, in fictional Glenview, [[Long Island]], New York, where he continued [[High school (North America)|high school]] and, with youthful naiveté, attempted to maintain a "secret identity". In ''Strange Tales'' #106 (March 1963), Johnny discovered that his friends and neighbors knew of his dual identity all along, from Fantastic Four news reports, but were humoring him. Supporting characters included Johnny's girlfriend, Doris Evans, usually in consternation as Johnny cheerfully flew off to battle bad guys. She was seen again in a 1973 issue of ''Fantastic Four'', having become a heavyset but cheerful wife and mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Gerry Conway|Conway, Gerry]]|penciller= [[John Buscema|Buscema, John]]|inker= Sinnott, Joe|story= A Dragon Stalks the Skies|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 134|date= May 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayers took over the penciling after ten issues, later followed by original [[Human Torch (android)|Golden Age Human Torch]] creator [[Carl Burgos]] and others. The Fantastic Four made occasional cameo appearances, and the Thing became a co-star with issue #123 (Aug. 1964).

The Human Torch shared the split book ''[[Strange Tales]]'' with fellow feature [[Doctor Strange]] for the majority of its run, before being replaced in issue #135 (August 1965) by [[Nick Fury|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. The Silver Age stories were republished in 1974, along with some Golden Age Human Torch stories, in a short-lived ongoing ''Human Torch'' series.

A later ongoing solo series in Marvel's [[manga]]-influenced Tsunami [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]], ''Human Torch'', ran 12 issues (June 2003 – June 2004), followed by the five-issue limited series ''Spider-Man/Human Torch'' (March–July 2005), an untold tales [[team-up]] arc spanning the course of their friendship.

===The Thing solo===
The Thing appeared in two team-up issues of ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' (#11–12, September–November 1973). Following their success, he was given his own regular team-up title ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'', co-starring with Marvel heroes not only in the present day but occasionally in other time periods (fighting alongside the [[World War II]]-era [[Liberty Legion]] in #20 and the 1930s hero [[Doc Savage]] in #21, for example) and in [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate realities]]. The series ran 100 issues (January 1974 – June 1983), with seven summer annuals (1976–1982) and was immediately followed by the solo title ''The Thing'' #1–36 (July 1983 – June 1986). Another ongoing solo series, also titled ''The Thing'', ran eight issues (January–August 2006).

==Characters {{Anchor|The team}}==
The Fantastic Four is formed after four civilian astronauts are exposed to [[cosmic rays]] during an unauthorized [[outer space]] test flight in an experimental [[rocket]] ship designed by Dr. Reed Richards. Pilot Ben Grimm and crew-members Susan Storm and her brother Johnny Storm survive an emergency [[Emergency landing|crash-land]]ing in a field on Earth. Upon exiting the rocket, the four discover they have developed incredible [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]], and decide to use these powers to help others.

In the first issue the crew talks about Reed Richards' rocketship flying to the stars. Stan Lee's original synopsis described the crew's plan to fly to Mars, but Lee later shortly afterward wrote that due to "the rate the Communists are progressing in space, maybe we better make this a flight to the STARS, instead of just to Mars, because by the time this mag goes on sale, the Russians may have already MADE a flight to Mars!"&lt;ref&gt;Note reprinted in {{cite book|last = Lee|first = Stan|title = Marvel Firsts: The 1960s|chapter= Snopses" [sic] The Fantsiuc [sic] Four July '61 Schedule (#)|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2011|pages = 484–485 |isbn = 978-0785158646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a significant departure from preceding superhero conventions, the Fantastic Four make no effort to maintain secret identities or, until issue #3, to wear superhero costumes, instead maintaining a public profile and enjoying celebrity status for scientific and heroic contributions to society. At the same time, they are often prone to arguing and even fighting with one another. Despite their bickering, the Fantastic Four consistently prove themselves to be "a cohesive and formidable team in times of crisis."&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Wright | first=Bradford W. | year=2001 | title=Comic Book Nation: The Transformation of Youth Culture in America | location=Baltimore, Maryland |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]| isbn=0-8018-7450-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|204–205}}

While there have been a number of lineup changes to the group, the four characters who debuted in ''Fantastic Four'' #1 remain the core and most frequent lineup.
* '''[[Mister Fantastic]]''' (Reed Richards), a scientific genius, can stretch, twist and re-shape his body to inhuman proportions. Mr. Fantastic serves as the father figure of the group, and is "appropriately pragmatic, authoritative, and dull".&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;{{Rp|19}} Richards blames himself for the failed space mission, particularly because of how the event transformed pilot Ben Grimm.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;{{Rp|205}} Stan Lee said the stretch powers were inspired by DC's [[Plastic Man]], which had no equivalent in Marvel.&lt;ref name=conversation&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLmB3GprtboC&amp;pg=PA179|title=Stan Lee: Conversations|editor=McLaughlin, Jeff|chapter=Stan Lee Looks Back: The Comics Legend Recalls Life with Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and Heroes|page=179|year=2007|location= Jackson, Mississippi|publisher= [[University Press of Mississippi]]|ISBN=1578069858}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Invisible Woman|Invisible Girl/Invisible Woman]]''' (Susan Storm), Reed Richards' girlfriend (and eventual wife) has the ability to bend and manipulate light to render herself and others invisible. Stan Lee did not want Sue to have superstrength, "to be [[Wonder Woman]] and punch people", so eventually he came to invisibility, inspired by works such as ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]''.&lt;ref name=conversation/&gt; She later develops the ability to generate invisible force fields, which she uses for a variety of defensive and offensive effects.
* '''[[Human Torch|The Human Torch]]''' (Johnny Storm), Sue Storm's younger brother, possesses the ability to control fire, allowing him to project fire from his body, as well as the power to fly. This character was loosely based on a [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]] character published by Marvel's predecessor [[Timely Comics]] in the 1940s, an android that could ignite itself. Lee said that when he conceptualized the character, "I thought it was a shame that we didn't have The Human Torch anymore, and this was a good chance to bring him back".&lt;ref name="Daniels"/&gt;{{Rp|85}} Unlike the teen sidekicks that preceded him, the Human Torch in the early stories was "a typical adolescent — brash, rebellious, and affectionately obnoxious."&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;{{Rp|204}} Johnny Storm was killed in the 2011 storyline "Three",&lt;ref name="JohnnyDeath2"/&gt; before being brought back and rejoining the reformed Fantastic Four.&lt;ref name="FF600"&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Jonathan Hickman|Hickman, Jonathan]]|penciller= [[Carmine Di Giandomenico|Di Giandomenico, Carmine]]|inker= Di Giandomenico, Carmine|story= Whatever Happened to Johnny Storm?|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 600|date= January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Thing (comics)|The Thing]]''' (Ben Grimm), Reed Richards' college roommate and best friend, has been transformed into a monstrous, orange, rock-like humanoid possessing high levels of superhuman strength and durability.  The Thing is often filled with anger, self-loathing and self-pity over his new existence. He serves as "an uncle figure, a long-term friend of the family with a gruff [[Brooklyn]] manner, short temper, and caustic sense of humor".&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;{{Rp|204}} In the original synopsis Lee gave to Kirby, The Thing was intended as "the heavy", but over the years, the character has become "the most lovable group member: honest, direct and free of pretension".&lt;ref name="Daniels"/&gt;{{Rp|86}} Lee said his original pitch to Kirby stated that The Thing was "someone who turned into a monster" and is bitter because unlike the other three he cannot change back to a normal appearance.&lt;ref name=conversation/&gt;

The Fantastic Four has had several different headquarters, most notably the [[Baxter Building]], located at [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] and [[Madison Avenue]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Irving |first=Christopher |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |url=http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/55001/ |title=A Land of Geeks and Goblins |accessdate=July 14, 2010 |date=March 1, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Gv3JYJUn?url=http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/55001/ |archivedate=May 27, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in New York City. The Baxter Building was replaced by [[Four Freedoms Plaza]] at the same location after its destruction at the hands of [[Kristoff Vernard]], adopted son of the team's seminal foe [[Doctor Doom]].

==Supporting characters==

===Allies and supporting characters===
A number of characters are closely affiliated with the team, share complex personal histories with one or more of its members but have never actually held an official membership. Some of these characters include, but are not limited to: [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] (previously an antagonist), [[Alicia Masters]],&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 89: "[The Puppet Master] used his blind stepdaughter Alicia in a plot to destroy the Fantastic Four, but the young sculptress soon fell in love with the Thing."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lyja]] the Lazerfist, [[H.E.R.B.I.E.]], [[Kristoff Vernard]] ([[Doctor Doom]]'s former protégé), [[Wyatt Wingfoot]],&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 116: "Roughly based on the Native American athlete Jim Thorpe, Wyatt Wingfoot casually sauntered into Johnny Storm's life in ''Fantastic Four'' #51."&lt;/ref&gt; Sue and Johnny's father [[Franklin Storm]], the receptionist android [[Roberta (comics)|Roberta]], governess [[Agatha Harkness]],&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 144: "Issue #94 of the ''Fantastic Four'' introduced Agatha Harkness, the kindly witch who dwelt in a Gothic mansion atop Whisper Hill."&lt;/ref&gt; and Reed and Sue's children [[Franklin Richards (comics)|Franklin Richards]]&lt;ref name="DeFalco133" /&gt; and [[Valeria Richards]].

Several allies of the Fantastic Four have served as temporary members of the team, including [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]],&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 159: "In ''Fantastic Four'' #132, Medusa of the Inhumans replaced Susan Richards briefly on the FF."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] (Luke Cage), [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Nova]] (Frankie Raye),&lt;ref name="FF238"&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Byrne, John|story= The Lady Is for Burning!|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 238|date= January 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[She-Hulk]], [[Sharon Ventura|Ms. Marvel]] (Sharon Ventura), [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)]], [[Namorita]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. A temporary lineup from ''Fantastic Four'' #347–349 (December 1990 – February 1991) consisted of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] (in his "Joe Fixit" persona), [[Spider-Man]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)]].&lt;ref name="Manning252" /&gt;

Other notable characters who have been involved with the Fantastic Four include [[Alyssa Moy]], [[Captain Britain Corps|Caledonia]] ([[Alysande Stuart]] of Earth-9809), [[Fantastic Force]], the [[Inhumans]]&lt;ref name="DeFalco111" /&gt; (particularly the royal family members [[Black Bolt]], Crystal, Medusa, [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]], [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], [[Triton (comics)|Triton]], and [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]]), Reed's father [[Nathaniel Richards (Marvel Comics)|Nathaniel Richards]], the [[Silver Surfer]] (previously an antagonist), [[Thundra]], postal worker [[Willie Lumpkin]], Baxter Building landlord [[Walter Collins (comics)|Walter Collins]], the Thing's rivals the [[Yancy Street Gang]] and [[Uatu|Uatu the Watcher]].

Author [[Christopher Knowles (comics)|Christopher Knowles]] states that Kirby's work on creations such as the Inhumans and the Black Panther served as "a showcase of some of the most radical concepts in the history of the medium".&lt;ref name="Our Gods"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Knowles|first=Christopher| authorlink=Christopher Knowles (comics)|title=[[Our Gods Wear Spandex]]|publisher=[[Red Wheel Weiser Conari|Weiser]]|year=2007|location= Newburyport, Massachusetts|page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=93Mv-1R5yskC&amp;pg=PA173 173]–174|isbn=1-57863-406-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antagonists===
{{Main|List of Fantastic Four enemies}}
Writers and artists over many years have created a variety of characters to challenge the Fantastic Four. Knowles states that Kirby helped to create "an army of villains whose rage and destructive power had never been seen before," and "whose primary impulse is to smash the world."&lt;ref name="Our Gods"/&gt; Some of the team's oldest and most frequent enmities have involved such foes as the [[Mole Man]], the [[Skrull]]s,&lt;ref name="DeFalco84" /&gt; [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], [[Doctor Doom]], the [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]], [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang the Conqueror/Rama-Tut]]/[[Immortus]], [[Blastaar]], the [[Frightful Four]],&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 107: "The Wizard...gathered together his former partner the Trapster, along with the Sandman and Medusa to form the Frightful Four."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annihilus]],&lt;ref name="DeFalco133b" /&gt; [[Galactus]], and [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]]. Other prominent antagonists of the Fantastic Four have included the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], the [[Impossible Man]],&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 90: "An alien with the power to morph into any shape or substance he desired, the Impossible Man was hated by readers at first because he was not a serious menace."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Red Ghost]] and the [[Super-Apes]],&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 92: "With the Cold War's space race dominating the news, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby mixed real world events with comic book fantasy in ''The Fantastic Four'' #13...Familiar with the Fantastic Four's origin, Ivan Kragoff – the Red Ghost – trained a crew of apes to pilot a space  ship...he deliberately exposed himself and them to cosmic rays so that they could develop super-powers."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mad Thinker]], the [[Super-Skrull]], the [[Molecule Man]],&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 95: "Owen Reece...became Molecule Man when he inadvertently gained the power to control and reshape matter on the molecular level."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]], [[Dragon Man]],&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 107: "The fire-breathing monster known as Dragon Man first took wing ''Fantastic Four'' #35.

==Cultural impact==
The Fantastic Four's characterization was initially different from all other superheroes at the time. One major difference is that they do not [[secret identity|conceal their identities]], leading the public to be both suspicious and in awe of them. Also, they frequently argued and disagreed with each other, hindering their work as a team.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; Described as "heroes with hangups" by Stan Lee,&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.07/fantastic.html?pg=2&amp;topic=fantastic&amp;topic_set=|title= The Doom-Defying, Two-Fisted Marketing of Fantastic Four|last= Bing|first= Jonathon|date= July 2005|work= [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate= 2009-02-25|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6Guz8Dsuo?url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.07/fantastic.html?pg=2&amp;topic=fantastic&amp;topic_set=|archivedate= May 27, 2013|deadurl= no|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Thing has a temper, and the Human Torch resents being a child among adults. Mr. Fantastic blames himself for the Thing's transformation. Social scientist Bradford W. Wright describes the team as a "volatile mix of human emotions and personalities". In spite of their disagreements, they ultimately function well as a team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9pPgDE63U9oC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=%22fantastic+four%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22fantastic%20four%22&amp;f=false|title= Comic Book Nation|first= |last= Wright|year= 2001|page = 205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first issue of ''The Fantastic Four'' proved a success, igniting a new direction for superhero comics and soon influencing many other superhero comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Fein|first= Eric|title= The Creation of the Fantastic Four|publisher= The Rosen Publishing Group|year= 2006|page= 6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n1KHmaeMvwcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22fantastic+four%22|isbn=978-1-4042-0765-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers grew fond of Ben's grumpiness, Johnny's tendency to annoy others and Reed and Sue's spats. Stan Lee was surprised at the reaction to the first issue, leading him to stay in the comics field despite previous plans to leave. Comics historian Stephen Krensky said that "Lee's natural dialogue and flawed characters appealed to 1960s kids looking to 'get real'".&lt;ref name="century"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Krensky|first= Stephen|title= Comic Book Century: The History of American Comic Books| publisher= [[Lerner Publishing Group|Twenty-First Century Books]]|year= 2007|location= Minneapolis, Minnesota|page= 59|isbn=978-0-8225-6654-0| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=n23M0Bn0JmwC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=%22fantastic+four%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2005, 150 million comics featuring the Fantastic Four had been sold.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

==In other media==
There have been four ''The Fantastic Four'' [[list of animated television series|animated TV series]] and three released feature films. The Fantastic Four also guest-starred in the "Secret Wars" story arc of the 1990s [[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|''Spider-Man'' animated series]], and the Thing guest-starred (with a small cameo from the other Fantastic Four members) in the "Fantastic Fortitude" episode of the 1996 [[The Incredible Hulk (1996 animated series)|''The Incredible Hulk'' series]]. The Fantastic Four also appeared in the 2012 series ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''.

There was a short-lived [[radio programming|radio show]] in 1975 that adapted early Lee/Kirby stories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://pulpinterest.com/entertainment/fantastic-four-marvel-lous/|title= Marvel-lous – The Fantastic Four|first= Adrian|last= Carty|date= February 22, 2014|publisher= PulpInterest.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140223145956/http://www.pulpinterest.com/entertainment/fantastic-four-marvel-lous/|archivedate= February 23, 2014|deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is notable for casting a pre-''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' [[Bill Murray]] as the Human Torch. Also in the cast were Bob Maxwell as [[Reed Richards]], Cynthia Adler as [[Sue Storm]], Jim Pappas as [[Ben Grimm]] and Jerry Terheyden as [[Doctor Doom]]. Other Marvel characters featured in the series included [[Ant-Man]], [[Prince Namor]], [[Nick Fury]] and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. Stan Lee narrated the series and the scripts were taken almost verbatim from the comic books. The radio show was packaged into five-minute segments, with five segments comprising a complete adventure.&lt;ref name=rm100&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mangels|first=Andy|authorlink= Andy Mangels|title=Reel Marvel:  Fantastic Four in the cartoons history|journal=Marvel Age|date=May 1991|volume=1|issue=100|url=http://www.andymangels.com/marvelage.html|accessdate=June 25, 2012|publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team appeared on the [[Peter Pan Records|Power Records]] album ''Fantastic Four: "The Way It Began"'' book and record set, an audio dramatization of ''Fantastic Four'' #126.&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb series|id= 10254|title= Fantastic Four: ''"The Way It Began" book and record set'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
The Fantastic Four has been the subject of four animated television series. The first, ''[[Fantastic Four (1967 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'', produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Thomas|first = Roy|authorlink = Roy Thomas|author2=Sanderson, Peter |authorlink2=Peter Sanderson |title = The Marvel Vault: A Museum-in-a-Book with Rare Collectibles from the World of Marvel|publisher = [[Running Press]]|year = 2007|location= Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|page = 101|isbn = 978-0762428441|quote= In 1967, ''Spider-Man'' and ''Fantastic Four'' took over Saturday morning slots on ABC-TV, the latter produced by [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; ran 20 episodes on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 9, 1967 to March 15, 1970. The second ''[[The New Fantastic Four|Fantastic Four]]'' series, produced by [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises|DePatie-Freleng]], ran 13 episodes from September 9, 1978, to December 16, 1978; this series features a [[H.E.R.B.I.E.]] Unit in place of the Human Torch.&lt;ref name=rm100/&gt;

The third ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' was broadcast as part of ''[[The Marvel Action Hour]]'' umbrella, with introductions by Stan Lee. This series ran 26 episodes from September 24, 1994 to February 24, 1996. The fourth series, ''[[Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes]]'', debuted on September 2, 2006, on [[Cartoon Network]] and ran for 26 episodes.

In 1979, the Thing was featured as half of the Saturday morning cartoon ''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Thing]]''. The character of the Thing received a radical make-over for the series. The title character for this program was Benjy Grimm, a teenage boy who possessed a pair of magic Thing-rings which could transform him into the Thing when he put them together and said "Thing-ring, do your thing!" The other members of the Fantastic Four do not appear in the series, nor do the animated ''[[The Flintstones]]'' stars [[Fred Flintstone]] and [[Barney Rubble]], despite the title of the program.&lt;ref name=rm100/&gt;

Different Fantastic Four members appear briefly and with little or no dialogue and are mentioned various times throughout the first season of ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''. The most expansive appearances are in the episode "The Private War of Doctor Doom", in which the Avengers team up with the Fantastic Four to battle the titular supervillain, and in the final episode of season two, in which the groups team up to battle [[Galactus]]. The Thing becomes a member of the New Avengers in episode 23 of season 2.

The Fantastic Four appear in the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode "Monster No More."{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The Agents of S.M.A.S.H. assist the Fantastic Four in thwarting the Tribbitite Invasion.

===Film===
{{main|Fantastic Four in film}}
A film adaptation of the characters, ''[[The Fantastic Four (unreleased film)|The Fantastic Four]]'', was completed in 1994 by producer [[Roger Corman]]. The film was not released to theaters or on home video, but it has since been made available through [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] video distributors. It was made because [[Constantin Film]] owned the film rights and would have lost them if it failed to begin production by a certain deadline, a tactic known as creating an [[ashcan copy]].&lt;ref name=avclub&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vishnevetsky |first1=Ignatiy |title=Our option on ''Atlas Shrugged'' expires in two days: 6-plus copyright extensions disguised as movies |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/our-option-atlas-shrugged-expires-two-days-6-plus--212280 |publisher=''[[The A.V.

In 2005, the second film adaptation, ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' directed by [[Tim Story]], was released by [[20th Century Fox]].

Stan Lee makes cameo appearances as the mailman Willie Lumpkin in the first film and as himself in the second film.

===Video games===
In 1985, the Fantastic Four starred in ''[[Questprobe]] #3 The Fantastic Four'', an adventure game from [[Adventure International]] for the Atari 8-bit series. In 1997, the group starred in the [[Fantastic Four (1997 video game)|''Fantastic Four'' video game]]. The team appeared in the ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series (video game)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' video game, based on the 1990s [[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man animated series]], for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and [[Sega Genesis]]. The Thing and the Human Torch appeared in the 2005 game ''[[Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects]]''.

All of the Fantastic Four appear as playable characters in the game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' with Doctor Doom being the main enemy. The members of the Fantastic Four are also featured in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'', although the team is separated over the course of the game, with Mister Fantastic being 'locked' into the Pro-Registration side of the game's storyline and the Thing briefly becoming unavailable to the player- just as he left America in protest of the war- until he returns to assist in preventing civilian casualties during the conflict.

The Human Torch has an appearance in a mini-game where the player races against him in all versions of ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', except on the [[Game Boy Advance]] platform.

'''FinTech''' or [[financial technology]] has emerged as a relatively new industry in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/fintech-sector-proving-to-be-talent-magnet/articleshow/51986723.cms | title=Fintech sector proving to be talent magnet | publisher=[[The Economic Times]] | date=26 April 2016 | accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; FinTech is an industry comprising companies that use technology to offer financial services. These companies operate in [[insurance]], [[asset management]] and [[payment]], and numerous other industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.siliconindia.com/news/business/FinTech-Gaining-Momentum-in-India-with-Paytms-Payment-Banks-nid-194947-cid-3.html | title=FinTech Gaining Momentum in India with Paytm's Payment Banks | date=2 May 2016 | accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market size and growth==
According to the report of The National Association of Software and Services Companies ([[NASSCOM]]), India has a presence of approximately 400 companies in the fintech industry, with an investment of about $420 million (in 2015). The [[NASSCOM]] report also estimated the fintech software and services market to grow 1.7 times by 2020, making it worth $8 billion.&lt;ref name=FE&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.financialexpress.com/article/industry/companies/towards-a-fintech-revolution/262870/ | title=Fintech revolution in India: Tech-finance collaboration has fired up entrepreneurs | publisher=[[The Financial Express (India)|The Financial Express]] | date=23 May 2016 | accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian fintech landscape is segmented as follows – 34% in payment processing, followed by 32% in banking and 12% in the trading, public and private markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/india-emerging-as-fastest-growing-market-for-fintech-software-products/ | title=India emerging as fastest-growing market for fintech software products | publisher=[[ZDNet]] | date=3 May 2016 | accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seed accelerator|accelerators]] and [[business incubator|incubators]] tapping the [[startup ecosystem]] include [[PayPal]]’s Star Tank, [[Yes Bank]]’s collaboration with [[T-Hub]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/india-emerging-a-hub-for-fintech-start-ups-116051700397_1.html | title=India emerging a hub for fintech start-ups | publisher=[[Business Standard]] | date=18 May 2016 | accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Visakhapatnam]] (Vizag) is being developed as fintech valley and the local government of Andhra Pradesh had opened [[Fintech Valley Vizag|Fintech Valley]] to promote the investments in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fintechvalleyvizag.com/|title=Fintech Valley Vizag|website=fintechvalleyvizag.com|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techiexpert.com/all-set-for-vizag-fintech-festival-from-today/|title=Vizag Fintech Festival|last=|first=|date=2018-10-24|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=2018-10-24|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses|First contact (disambiguation)}}

In anthropology, '''first contact''' is the first meeting of two [[cultures]] previously unaware of one another.{{sfn|Scuppin|2014|page= 1}}&lt;ref name="Tcherkezoff2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Serge Tcherkezoff|title=First Contacts in Polynesia - the Samoan Case (1722-1848): Western Misunderstandings about Sexuality and Divinity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tVIduk23-BMC&amp;pg=PA1|date=1 August 2008|publisher=ANU E Press|isbn=978-1-921536-02-1|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BellBrown2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joshua A. Bell|author2=Alison K. Brown|author3=Robert J. Gordon|title=Recreating First Contact: Expeditions, Anthropology, and Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hKxqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT128|date=6 November 2013|publisher=Smithsonian|isbn=978-1-935623-24-3|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples of first contact are those between the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] (and ultimately all of the [[Americas]]) in 1492; and the [[Aboriginal Australians]] with Europeans in 1788 when the [[First Fleet]] arrived in [[Sydney]].{{sfn|Scuppin|2014|page= 1}}

Such contact is sometimes described as a "[[Discovery (observation)|discovery]]", such as the British and United States did with the legal theory using a "[[Doctrine of Discovery]].&lt;ref name="Harjo2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Suzan Shown Harjo|title=Nation to Nation: Treaties Between the United States and American Indian Nations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fqpqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT39|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Smithsonian|isbn=978-1-58834-479-3|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally the more technologically complex society that is able to travel to new geographic regions to make contact with those more isolated, less technologically developed societies.&lt;ref name="Stockard2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Stockard|title=Sociology: Discovering Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QPXVm_VpZT8C|year=2000|publisher=Wadsworth|page= 512|isbn=978-0-534-56521-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some object to the application of such a word to human beings, which is why "first contact" is generally preferred. The use of the term "discovery" tends to occur more in reference to [[geography]] than cultures; for an example of a common discovery debate, see [[Discoverer of the Americas]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Consequences ==
The [[historical]] record indicates that when one culture is significantly more [[technologically]] advanced than the other, this side will be favored by the disruptive nature of conflict, often with dire consequences for the other society. However the introduction of [[disease]] plays a critical role in this process. More isolated peoples who lived across broader territories in low density succumbed to the illnesses brought from the comparatively higher density of Europe. The Indigenous populations simply had not had the time to develop immunity to the multiple foreign diseases, all introduced at once, for which the more urbanised European populations had had many years to develop some population immunity to.&lt;ref&gt;http://rdcu.be/vwH4&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, this process was enhanced via the [[Native_American_disease_and_epidemics#Disease_as_a_weapon_against_Native_Americans|colonisers' intentional spread of disease as a biological weapon]], one notable example of this being in North America with the colonisers giving Native American tribes smallpox-infested blankets as gifts. 

Marshall Sahlins' work [https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Islands_of_History.html?id=ScuTytmgE6MC Islands of History] uses an ethnohistorical perspective to attempt to come to grips with the way that non-European peoples saw the first contact phenomenon. In it he argues that native people, while being changed by contact with Europeans, nonetheless did so through their own cultural frame of reference.

'''Grassroots Campaigns, Inc.''' is a for-profit corporation&lt;ref name=SFweekly /&gt;  that does strategic [[Consultant|consulting]], and [[fund raising]] for humanitarian and progressive causes and political organizations. Grassroots Campaigns employs thousands of workers to generate small-donor contributions, increase visibility, and expand the membership base for a number of progressive groups, issues, and campaigns. Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, the company was founded in December 2003 by a small team of experienced organizers who specialized in grassroots-level political and public interest organizing with groups like the [[Public Interest Research Group]] However, since its founding, it has consistently faced accusations of anti-union activity at odds with its stated progressive roots&lt;ref&gt;http://trail.pugetsound.edu/?p=5883&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
Grassroots Campaigns was founded in December 2003 with the goal of providing high-quality data-driven field campaigns and small donor fundraising campaigns to progressive organizations and candidates. The company expanded very rapidly.  By April 2004 Grassroots Campaigns had opened offices in 40 cities throughout the country. By July 2004 they had over 2,000 staff knocking on doors and fund raising on behalf of the [[Democratic National Committee]]. During that same year Grassroots work with [[MoveOn]] PAC to help staff and manage their "Leave No Voter Behind," campaign. This was a "[[get out the vote]]" (GOTV) program intended to give Democratic candidate John Kerry an edge in the swing states. By October 2004, they had more than 50,000 people canvassing their neighborhoods in 17 of the most contested swing states of the 2004 Presidential Election. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Following the 2004 election, Grassroots kept some of their field offices open in order to run door-to-door and site-based canvassing programs to raise money from small donors and help build and expand supporter lists on behalf of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and other groups.

In 2006, Grassroots Campaigns again partnered with MoveOn.org to run Call for Change, one of the largest volunteer phonebanking efforts in American history.&lt;ref name="pol.moveon.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pol.moveon.org/2006report/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322212723/http://pol.moveon.org/2006report/ |archivedate=2010-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 120 organizers in 40 cities nationwide recruited and trained over 100,000 volunteers who made more than 7 million phone calls to voters in the closest races of the midterm election.&lt;ref name="pol.moveon.org"/&gt; Following this election cycle, Grassroots continued to expand its year-round field programs, including maintaining base-building and small-donor fundraising operations in more than a dozen cities across the country.

During the 2008 election cycle, Grassroots Campaigns expanded and partnered with a number of organizations working to elect Barack Obama and other Democrats.  More than 200 organizers and canvass directors across the country ran programs that registered over 250,000 voters in key battleground states.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} As the election approached Grassroots Campaigns took part in get-out-the-vote efforts in key states.  Grassroots worked with the League of Conservation Voters among other groups to contact voters in key states and districts and encourage voters to make it out to the polls.

During the 2010 midterm elections, Grassroots Campaigns was active in Pennsylvania, Colorado, Missouri and Washington state.

Grassroots Campaigns ran nationwide voter mobilization effort in 2012 to re-elect President Obama and help other Democratic candidates get into office.  Most work was done in Colorado and Nevada, with additional projects in Montana and a few other states.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In 2014 Grassroots Campaigns did extensive work in Colorado, Iowa, Nevada and Pennsylvania.  Grassroots ran the largest canvass in the state for the Iowa Senate race, knocking on more than 150,000 doors statewide. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Following the election, Grassroots is launching permanent offices in Des Moines and Phoenix. While it continues to open offices throughout the country, it is also hampered as they also tend to close offices that engage in union activity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nlrb.gov/case/19-CA-137094&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current work ==

Grassroots Campaigns is currently running national campaigns for progressive political and charitable organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, Oxfam America, The Nature Conservancy and The Southern Poverty Law Center. 
 
Grassroots Campaigns entered the fall of 2012 running offices in 18 cities. Grassroots Campaigns currently employs over 100 Lead Directors,Assistant Directors and Field Staff who manage staff and run these offices and an estimated 750 paid canvassers nationwide.

== Controversies ==

In 2006 and 2007 Grassroots Campaigns settled two wage disputes out of court, one in California and one in Oregon.  The California claim alleged that workers were being asked to work more hours than allowed by California law during the days leading up to the 2006 election.  The Oregon claim alleged that Grassroots improperly paid some students a minimum wage less than the local allowed minimum wage for a portion of their hours worked.  Grassroots Campaigns claimed the students were paid properly and legally, and the matter was settled by both parties.&lt;ref name=SFweekly&gt;{{cite news|last=Friedman|first=Taylor|title=Gross Profit: Money Given to Clipboard Kids Rarely Makes It to Nonprofits|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2011-09-28/news/grassroots-campaign-nonprofit-solicitation-taylor-friedman/4/|accessdate=26 January 2012|newspaper=SF Weekly|date=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;([http://www.wweek.com/editorial/3246/8010/ Willamette Week], 9/20/06).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orcourtsonline.com/ Oregon Courts Online], subscription needed to access court records&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Ulrich Obrist''' (born 1968) is an art curator, critic and historian of art. He is artistic director at the [[Serpentine Galleries]], London. Obrist is the author of ''The Interview Project'', an extensive ongoing project of interviews. He is also co-editor of the ''[[Cahiers d'art]]'' revue.

==Life and work==
Obrist was born in [[Zürich]], Switzerland. When he was 23, he organized an exhibition of contemporary art in his kitchen.&lt;ref&gt;Field, Marcus. [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/visual-art-an-object-lesson-in-what-goes-where-1130391.html An object lesson in what goes where]. [[The Independent]], December 5, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, he founded the ''Museum Robert Walser'' and began to run the ''Migrateurs'' program at the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]] where he served as an iphonex [[curator]] for [[contemporary art]]. In 1996, he co-curated [[Manifesta]] 1, the first edition of the roving European biennial of contemporary art. In the November 2009 issue of [[ArtReview]] magazine, Obrist was ranked number one in the publication's annual list of the [[art world]]'s one-hundred most powerful people and that same year he was made an Honorary Fellow of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architecture.com/NewsAndPress/News/RIBANews/News/2009/RIBAannounces12HonoraryFellowships.aspx|date=6 October 2009|title=RIBA announces 12 Honorary Fellowships|publisher=architecture.com|accessdate=15 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416181957/http://www.architecture.com/NewsAndPress/News/RIBANews/News/2009/RIBAannounces12HonoraryFellowships.aspx|archivedate=16 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obrist first gained art world attention in 1991, when as a student in Politics and Economics in St. Gallen, Switzerland, he mounted  an exhibition in the kitchen of his apartment entitled "The Kitchen Show"&lt;ref name="evestan"/&gt; It featured work by [[Christian Boltanski]] and [[Peter Fischli &amp; David Weiss]].&lt;ref&gt;Leon Neyfakh (December 16, 2009), [http://www.observer.com/2009/culture/man-whos-made-curating-art The Man Who Made Curating an Art] ''[[New York Observer]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Obrist is an advocate and archivist for artists, and has said "I really do think artists are the most important people on the planet, and if what I do is a utility and helps them, then that makes me happy. I want to be helpful."&lt;ref name="evestan"&gt;Roberts, Alison (October 22, 2009),  [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23759636-Hans Ulrich-obrist---the-god-of-planet-art.do Hans Ulrich Obrist - The God of Planet Art.] ''[[The London Evening Standard]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Obrist is known for his lively pace and emphasis on inclusion in all cultural activities.

While maintaining official curatorial positions, he is also the co-founder of the Brutally Early Club,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brutallyearlyclub.org/ Brutally Early Club]&lt;/ref&gt; a discussion group open to all that meets at Starbucks in London, Berlin, New York and Paris at 6:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., and is a contributing editor of [[032c]] magazine, [[Artforum]] and Paradis Magazine, among others. Hans Ulrich Obrist has lectured internationally at academic and art institutions including [[European Graduate School]] in [[Saas-Fee]],&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;[http://www.egs.edu/faculty/Hans Ulrich-obrist/biography/ Hans Ulrich Obrist]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

March 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He lives and works in London.

==''The Interview'' project==

Obrist's interest in interviews was first triggered by two very long conversations that he read when he was a student. One was between Pierre Cabanne and [[Marcel Duchamp]], and the other between [[David Sylvester]] and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]. "These books somehow brought me to art," he has said. "They were like oxygen, and were the first time that the idea of an interview with an artist as a medium became of interest to me. They also sparked my interest in the idea of sustained conversations—of interviews recorded over a period of time, perhaps over the course of many years; the Bacon/Sylvester interviews took place over three long sessions, for example."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artbook.com/9783905829556.html Hans Ulrich Obrist ''A brief history of Curating''] Artbook.com&lt;/ref&gt;

So far, nearly 2000 hours of interviews have been recorded.&lt;ref name="observer"/&gt; This fascinating archive is referred to by Obrist as “an endless conversation”. He began publishing these interviews in Artforum in 1996 and in 2003 eleven of these interviews were released as ''Interviews Volume 1''. ''Volume 2'' was published in Summer 2010. With the release, a total of 69 artists, architects, writers, film-makers, scientists, philosophers, musicians and performers share their unique experiences and frank insights.

The longer interviews in Obrist's archive are being published singly in ongoing series of books entitled "The Conversation Series". Thus far, 28 books have been published, each containing a lengthy interview with cultural figures including [[John Baldessari]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Robert Crumb]] and [[Rem Koolhaas]]. A number of Obrist's interviews have also appeared in the Berlin culture magazine [[032c]], including those with artists [[Elaine Sturtevant]] and [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]], and structural engineer [[Cecil Balmond]] of [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://032c.com/topic/Hans Ulrich-obrist/ Hans Ulrich Obrist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050947/http://032c.com/topic/Hans |date=2016-03-04 }} at 032c.com&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 May 2015, Obrist interviewed artist and poet [[Jimmie Durham]] in Venice, on the social live video broadcasting platform [[Periscope_(app)|Periscope]], using an [[iPhone]]. Periscope staff had designated the video as "FEATURED", thus it was made available to a much wider audience than Obrist's followers. Unless this interview is published elsewhere, it will be lost as of 9 May 2015, as the platform does not store videos for longer than 24 hours. On an irregular schedule, Obrist has subsequently interviewed various other artists in depth on Periscope.

==Curatorial activities==

Obrist has an abiding fascination with the history of art institutions and curatorial practice. In his early 20s he began to research the topic. "At a certain moment, when I started doing my own shows, I felt it would be really interesting to know what is the history of my profession. I realized that there was no book, which was kind of a shock."&lt;ref name="observer"&gt;Neyfakh, Leon. [http://www.observer.com/node/120816 The Man Who Made Curating an Art] [[The New York Observer]], December 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He has since helped to rectify this gap with exhibitions on curating and a book entitled ''A Brief History of Curating''. This volume, which is part of Obrist's Interviews project (see above) compiles interviews from some of the leading curators of the 20th century.

While the history of exhibitions has started, in this last decade, to be examined more in depth, what remains largely unexplored are the ties that interconnected manifestations have created among curators, institutions, and artists. For this reason, Obrist's conversations go beyond stressing the remarkable achievements of a few individuals...Obrist's collected volume pieces together "a patchwork of fragments," underlining a network of relationships within the art.&lt;ref&gt;Obrist, Hans Ulrich (2010). ''A Brief History of Curating, JRP|Ringier &amp; Les Presses Du Réel, Zurich. {{ISBN|9783905829556}}''&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with his desire to explore the world of art and view it as an open system, Obrist has long advocated a participatory model for his activities. One early project, 1997's "do it", is an ongoing exhibition &lt;ref name="eflux"&gt;[http://www.e-flux.com/projects/do_it/itinerary/introduction.html do it.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314034335/http://www.e-flux.com/projects/do_it/itinerary/introduction.html |date=2012-03-14 }} e-flux. 1997&lt;/ref&gt; that consists of instructions set out by artists for anyone to follow. In his introduction to the project, Obrist notes that "do it stems from an open exhibition model, and exhibition in progress. Individual instructions can open empty spaces for occupation and invoke possibilities for the interpretations and rephrasing of artworks in a totally free manner. do it effects interpretations based on location, and calls for a dovetailing of local structures with the artworks themselves. The diverse cities in which do it takes place actively construct the artwork context and endow it with their individual marks or distinctions."&lt;ref name="eflux"/&gt;(sic)

Obrist curated "Utopia Station", a section of the Venice Biennale, in 2003, and is briefly interviewed about the project in [[Sarah Thornton]]'s ''Seven Days in the Art World''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/489232834|title=Seven days in the art world|last=L.)|first=Thornton, Sarah (Sarah|isbn=9780393337129|location=New York|oclc=489232834}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2007, Obrist co-curated Il Tempo del Postino with [[Philippe Parreno]] for the Manchester International Festival, also presented at [[Art Basel]], 2009, organised by [[Fondation Beyeler]] and [[Theater Basel]]. In the same year, the Van Alen Institute awarded him the New York Prize Senior Fellowship for 2007-2008. In 2008 he curated Everstill at the Lorca House in Granada.

More recently, Obrist he has initiated a series of "marathons". The Marathon series of public events was conceived by Hans Ulrich Obrist in Stuttgart in 2005. The first in the Serpentine series, the Interview Marathon in 2006, involved interviews with leading figures in contemporary culture over 24 hours, conducted by Obrist and architect [[Rem Koolhaas]]. This was followed by the Experiment Marathon, conceived by Obrist and artist [[Olafur Eliasson]] in 2007, which included 50 experiments by speakers across both arts and science, including [[Peter Cook]], [[Neil Turok]], [[Kim Gordon]], [[Simone Forti]], Fia Bäckstrom and Joseph Grigely. There was also the Manifesto Marathon in 2008 and the Poetry Marathon in 2009, which consisted of poems read aloud by artists and writers including [[Gilbert &amp; George]], [[Tracey Emin]], [[Nick Laird]], [[Geoffrey Hill]], and [[James Fenton]].&lt;ref&gt;Orr, Gillian.

The 2014 Extinction Marathon: Visions of the Future&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ellis-Petersen|first1=Hannah|title=The Extinction Marathon: the art world's bid to save the human race|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/20/serpentine-extinction-marathon-yoko-ono-gilbert-george|accessdate=8 March 2015|publisher=The Guardian UK|date=20 October 2014 &lt;!-- 17.15 BST --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; linked the humanities and the sciences to discussions of environmental and human impact on the world today. It was programmed with artist [[Gustav Metzger]] whose research addresses issues of extinction and climate change. Notable participants included artists [[Etel Adnan]], [[Ed Atkins]], Jesse Darling, Gilbert &amp; George, [[Katja Novitskova]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Susan Hiller]], [[Marguerite Humeau]], [[Trevor Paglen]], [[Cornelia Parker]] amongst notable model and actor [[Lily Cole]] and Founder of ''The Whole Earth Catalog'' and Co-Founder of The Long Now Foundation [[Stewart Brand]].

==Quotes==

"I think great artists always change what we expect from art. And then there is the famous "étonnez-moi". In the conversation with Cocteau and Diaghilev and the Ballets russes which was a great moment where art met theatre, and there was this famous explanation, and they said "étonnez-moi!" ["Astonish me!"]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/newsInfo/newsID/3851 Interview with Hans Ulrich Obrist] Artfacts, November 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Happily Divorced''''' is an American [[sitcom]] created by [[Fran Drescher]] and her ex-husband [[Peter Marc Jacobson]]. Inspired by their experiences, the series, which became [[TV Land]]'s third original scripted series following ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'' and ''[[Retired at 35]]'', ran from June 15, 2011, to February 13, 2013, and revolves around a Los Angeles florist who finds out her husband of 18 years is gay. The series was canceled after two seasons on August 23, 2013.&lt;ref name="cancelled"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/08/tv-lands-happily-divorced-cancelled/|title=TV Land's 'Happily Divorced' Cancelled|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development and production ==
[[File:Happily Divorced s1 starts shooting.jpg|thumb|left|220px|''Happily Divorced'' cast during the first season.]]

''Happily Divorced'' is inspired by the real lives of series creators Fran Drescher and Peter Marc Jacobson, who had been high school sweethearts and then married in 1978. They divorced in 1999. Jacobson later [[Coming out|came out]] as gay to Drescher and the two remained friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/15/fran-dreschers-happily-divorced_n_835851.html |title=Fran Drescher's 'Happily Divorced' Close To TV Land Pickup|last=Zakarin|first=Jordan|date=March 15, 2011|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the pair, who had previously created Drescher's earlier series ''[[The Nanny]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/2010/6/4/fran_drescher_outs_ex_hubby_says.htm Fran Drescher Outs Ex Hubby, Says They're Still Great Friends] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608132145/http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/2010/6/4/fran_drescher_outs_ex_hubby_says.htm |date=2010-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; began developing the series based on their life experiences. Initially Drescher planned only to write and produce ''Happily Divorced'' but eventually decided to star as well.  Set in Los Angeles, Fran's gay ex-husband still lives with her for economic reasons, with "a very traditional family. Everyone's very accepting that he's gay. They're both dating; he's new at it, she's new at it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guyspy.com/modern-family-peter-marc-jacobson-success-sexuality-and-being-love-fran-drescher|title=Modern Family: Peter Marc Jacobson on Success, Sexuality, and Being in Love with Fran Drescher – GuySpy|work=guyspy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TV Land gave the [[Green-light|green light]] to a [[television pilot|pilot]] episode in November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2010/11/30/TV-Land-greenlights-two-scripted-pilots/UPI-90221291140897/ |title=TV Land greenlights two scripted pilots |publisher=UPI.com |date=November 30, 2010 |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network announced on March 21, 2011, that the series had been picked up with a ten-episode order.&lt;ref name = bc /&gt; The show is shot in front of a live studio audience at CBS Radford in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; |url=http://on-camera-audiences.com/shows/Happily_Divorced |title=Happily Divorced |publisher=On-camera-audiences.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Littleton |first=Cynthia |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118031913?refcatid=4025&amp;printerfriendly=true |title=Producers double down for TV Land – Entertainment News, Headline Newsletter Top Stories, Media |publisher=Variety |date=February 10, 2011 |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides ''Happily Divorced'' the typical style of the 1990s' sitcoms. There are still more parallels to ''The Nanny'': the opener is an animation, underlaid with specially composed music and also, Drescher refuses a role name and is just called 'Fran'.&lt;ref name="blogs.tvland.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.tvland.com/prime/happily-divorced-starring-fran-drescher-starts-production/ |title="Happily Divorced" Starring Fran Drescher Starts Production « TV Land Prime |publisher=Blogs.tvland.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318101836/http://blogs.tvland.com/prime/happily-divorced-starring-fran-drescher-starts-production/ |archivedate=March 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Nanny'' regulars, Renée Taylor and Charles Shaughnessy, have made guest appearances; the latter having also co-starred on ''Living With Fran''. The show premiered on Wednesday, June 15, 2011, in the 10:30 time slot after the television show ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]''.&lt;ref name="blogs.tvland.com" /&gt;

The show was renewed on July 20, 2011, for a second season of 12 episodes, which started airing weekly on March 7, 2012. The new season is advertised by the slogan "The Laugh is Back".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvland.com/video-clips/happily-divorced/hot-in-cleveland-and-happily-divorced-are-back/ |title=Hot in Cleveland and Happily Divorced Are Back |publisher=TVland.com |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224005056/http://www.tvland.com/video-clips/happily-divorced/hot-in-cleveland-and-happily-divorced-are-back |archivedate=February 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning of February 2012 TV Land made the guest stars for season 2 public. There are again some famous ''The Nanny'' faces : [[Renée Taylor]] (alias ''Sylvia Fine'') returns from season 1 as Dori's neighbor "Marilyn", and [[Ann Morgan Guilbert|Ann Guilbert]] (alias ''Yetta'') appears as Marilyn's mother, "Mrs. Kapelmaster". Furthermore, Hollywood beauties [[Morgan Fairchild]] and [[Joan Collins]] will be on view as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/morgan-fairchild-guest-star-on-fran-drescher-happily-divorced-1027928.php |title=Morgan Fairchild to guest star on Fran Drescher's 'Happily Divorced' |publisher=Reality TV World |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 2012, the day of the [[TV Land Awards]] 2012, the cable broadcaster extended the second season, picking up an additional 12 episodes, bringing the total count of season 2 to 24 episodes. The initial 12 episode order concluded June 6. The 12 additional episodes began airing November 28, 2012, at 10:30 PM EST, following the Season 4 premiere of ''Hot in Cleveland'' at 10 PM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/483905-TV_Land_Extends_Happily_Divorced_s_Second_Season.php/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731114013/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/483905-TV_Land_Extends_Happily_Divorced_s_Second_Season.php/|date=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was officially cancelled on August 23, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fran-drescher-comedy-happily-divorced-613711/ |title=Fran Drescher Comedy 'Happily Divorced' Canceled at TV Land |publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com |date=2013-08-23 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==

Early reviews of the series were mixed. David Hinckley, writing for ''[[The New York Daily News]],'' noted that it "may be that all this will develop an interesting story. On opening night, though, it feels like the show's primary goal is to set up one-liners – which is not how the great shows got to be great."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Hinckley|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2011/06/14/2011-06-14_happily_divorced_review_fran_dreschers_new_tv_land_series_uses_oneliners_gayfrie.html?r=entertainment|title=Fran Drescher's New TV Land Series Uses One-liners, Gay-friendly Jokes|work=[[The New York Daily News]]|date=June 14, 2011|accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "so painfully broad and filled with gay stereotypes all but Drescher's most faithful fans will yearn to be separated from their TVs,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brian|last=Lowry|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117945451|title=TV Review &gt; Happily Divorced|date=June 15, 2011|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Matthew Gilbert of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' summed it as "the kind of throwback you just might want to throw back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matthew|last=Gilbert|url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-06-15/ae/29661694_1_peter-marc-jacobson-tv-land-comic-relief|title=Drescher's New Sitcom Sounds Familiar In Several Ways|date=June 15, 2011|work=[[Boston Globe]]|accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark A. Perigard's review for ''[[The Boston Herald]]'' was very emphatic; he noted that "in ''Happily Divorced'', TV Land, the cable channel for baby boomers, finally may have found the perfect companion to its smash ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark A.|last=Perigard|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/television/reviews/view/2011_0615happily_never_after_fran_drescher_borrows_from_life_for_divorced_comedy/|title=Fran Drescher Borrows From Life For ''Divorced'' Comedy|date=June 15, 2011|work=[[Boston Herald]]|accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18987">Indigenous people under the nation-state have experienced exclusion and dispossession. With the rise in [[globalization]], material advantages for indigenous populations have diminished. At times, national governments have negotiated natural resources without taking into account whether or not these resources exist on indigenous lands. In this sense for many indigenous populations, the effects of globalization mirror the effects of the conquest in the mid 16th century.

In response, indigenous political movements have emerged in various countries in North and South America. These movements share similarities. Many seek specific rights for indigenous populations. These rights include the right to self-determination and the right to preserve their culture and heritage. Aims differ. One of the main differences is the way in which they organize themselves to meet their objectives. There have been movements in [[Latin America]] to unite indigenous populations separated by national borders. The following are examples of groups that have organized in order to be heard on a transnational level. These movements call for indigenous rights to become a universal right to be acknowledged by all countries with indigenous populations.

==Transnational organizations==

===Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin (COICA)===
This organization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coica.org.ec/ingles/organization/what_is.html|title=COICA homepage|author=|date=|website=COICA.org.ec|access-date=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; coordinates the following nine national Amazonian indigenous organizations:
* [[Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest]] (AIDESEP)
* Amerindian People’s Association of Guyana (APA)
* [[Confederation of Indigenous people of Bolivia]] (CIDOB)
* [[Coordination of the Indigenous Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon]] (COIAB)
* [[Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon]] (CONFENIAE)
* Regional Organization of Indigenous Towns of the Amazon
* Federation des Organisations Amerindiennes de Guyane
* Organization Van Inheemsen in Suriname
* Organization of the Indigenous Towns of the Colombian Amazonia

===Indian Council of South America (CISA)===
The Indian Council of South America was founded in 1980. It is a non-governmental organization that works in consultation with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. This council also seeks to maintain relations with international agencies such as UNESCO, FAO, and WHO. One of CISA’s objectives is to promote respect for the right to life, justice, development, peace, and autonomy of the indigenous peoples and Nations.
CISA also coordinates an exchange of knowledge, experiences and projects between indigenous peoples and nations in respect to development that will improve their welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puebloindio.org/CISA/cisa.htm|title=CISA|author=|date=|website=www.PuebloIndio.org|access-date=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Maya League===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}One of the most important goals for the Maya League is to return to the Mayan balance that was interrupted with the Spanish conquest of 1524. This group, similar to COICA, works to preserve and inform people about the culture of the Mayan people. This group has reached out to other states like Costa Rica and some of the states in the United States in order to carry out activities in the areas of teaching, research, and services. One of the defining factors about this group is that it does not have any formal leadership roles appointed to any one person. Rather, the Mayan League sticks to its ancestral beliefs that all can participate in decision making activity. Some of the problems that the Maya League seeks to combat are racism, repression, marginalization, and poverty. Currently, there is a large population of Maya living in Guatemala.

[[Mexico]] has the most adapted modern [[Maya peoples]] today; they are from Mayan Yucatec branch, most of them totally integrated into the [[Mexican economy]], from peasants, retail, handcraft or "Maquiladora" factory workers to doctors, engineers and politicians.

== Indigenous movements in Latin America by country ==
Latin America is primarily known{{By whom|date=July 2017}} for their growing indigenous rights movement. Groups within countries have done work to publicize indigenous rights in their respective countries.

=== Trans-national movements ===
Transnational movements have helped publicize the indigenous rights movement in Latin America. Trans-national movements regarding indigenous rights could be seen{{By whom|date=July 2017}} as the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.transcomm.ox.ac.uk/working%20papers/WPTC-02-05%20Radcliffe.pdf|title=Indigenous People and Political Transnationalism: Globalization from below meets globalization from above?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many political related movements regarding the rights of indigenous peoples have taken hold particularly in the 1990s due to "time and allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puig|first=Salvador Martí i|date=January 1, 2010|title=The Emergence of Indigenous Movements in Latin America and Their Impact on the Latin American Political Scene: Interpretive Tools at the Local and Global Levels|jstor=25750421|journal=Latin American Perspectives|volume=37|issue=6|pages=74–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Political collaboration has been integral for the progress of indigenous peoples. Multilateral agencies and NGO's have been helping to increase leverage for indigenous peoples rights. The first Peruvian president of indigenous origin, Alejandro Toldeo, was elected in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/international-jan-june01-toledo_06-04/|title=The Challenges of The President of Peru, Alejandro Toledo|newspaper=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the first time that someone of Indian descent was the ruler since the 1930s. Transnational organizations have been credited for contributing to Cué's victory in Mexico.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nacla.org/article/power-transnational-organizing-indigenous-migrant-politics-oaxacalifornia|title=The Power of Transnational Organizing: Indigenous Migrant Politics in Oaxacalifornia|website=NACLA|access-date=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Front of Binational Organizations (FIOB), one of the most active indigenous organizations, is credited for this feat. Trans-national movements like the FIOB "represents a broad network of relationships, organizational structures, and cultural traditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" Solidarity is one of the main attributes for the success of trans-national movements.

Global trans-national movements also influence regional movements. For example, since the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Indigenous Rights in Latin America: The Gap between Doctrine and Reality|journal=Human Rights and Human Welfare|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was passed, there has been progress made for the indigenous rights movement. Trans-national movements aim to enforce these policies through their work with domestic movements throughout the Americas.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Transnational movements have shifted their focus towards environmental rights. As deforestation occurs in areas such as the Amazon, many movements aim to work in solidarity to bring these secondary issues to light. [[Amazon Watch]] is one non-governmental organization that aims to publicize the plight of deforestation in the Amazon in regards to the lives of indigenous peoples. Oil drilling is one issue that Amazon Watch fights against. A pipeline spill in the Peruvian Amazon highlights the plight of indigenous protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amazonwatch.org/news/2016/1025-another-pipeline-spill-reported-in-peruvian-amazon-as-indigenous-protests-enter-eighth-week|title=Amazon Watch - Another Pipeline Spill Reported in Peruvian Amazon As Indigenous Protests Enter Eighth Week|website=Amazon Watch|access-date=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five indigenous communities sought to remediate the polluted sites and gain compensation for damages to their land. This shift has helped to gain more awareness as environmental protection becomes more important in the rights for indigenous peoples.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} The [[Dakota Access Pipeline]] protests is one example of the fight for indigenous rights to sacred land in the United States. More than 40% of the [[Standing Rock Sioux Tribe]] live below the poverty line&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/11/06/dakota-pipeline-native-poverty/|title=The Dakota Pipeline Could Devastate Some of the Poorest People in America|date=November 6, 2016|website=Fortune|access-date=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this pipeline could negatively affect both the environment and well-being of the tribe.

=== Brazil ===

==== Background ====
Indigenous rights have largely been ignored throughout Brazil's history. They were considered "second-class citizens&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=TRAJECTORIES OF TRANSNATIONAL MOBILIZATION FOR INDIGENOUS RIGHTS IN BRAZIL|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;" and much of their land was taken away for economic development. Brazilian is also historically known for the "physical and cultural extermination of the indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lap.sagepub.com/content/43/2/172.full|title=Legal Dualism and the Bipolar State|website=Latin American Perspectives|access-date=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;" However, the indigenous movement in Brazil has largely grown since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although policies have been changed to include the rights of the indigenous peoples, it ignores the collective right to their land.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

===== Cases =====
The 2002 [[Xucuru]] case in Brazil highlights the role of the state in the struggle of present-day indigenous peoples in Brazil. The [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] was asked to safeguard Marcos de Araújo, after they received death threats regarding their right to indigenous land.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; The state rejected this request because of various reasons. Much of the Indian rights movement in Brazil focus on right to land, and not individual liberties. Although indigenous tribes are marginalized and largely unrepresented in government, Brazil's Articulation of Indigenous People's have staged protests around major cities in Brazil to focus on fighting for territorial rights of the native peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amazonwatch.org/news/2013/1001-massive-indigenous-rights-movement-launches-across-brazil|title=Amazon Watch - Massive Indigenous Rights Movement Launches Across Brazil|website=Amazon Watch|access-date=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of this issue shows that "constitutional recognition of indigenous human rights and a multicultural and collectivist perspective does not eliminate the legal and political obstacles to implementing those rights.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;"

{{About||the human faculty of thinking and understanding|Intellect|human intelligence|Human intelligence}}

'''Intelligence''' has been defined in many ways, including: the capacity for [[logic]], [[understanding]], [[self-awareness]], [[learning]], [[emotional knowledge]], [[reason]]ing, [[planning]], [[creativity]], and [[problem solving]]. More generally, it can be described as the ability to perceive or infer [[information]], and to retain it as [[knowledge]] to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context.

Intelligence is most often studied in humans but has also been observed in both non-human animals and in plants. Intelligence in machines is called [[artificial intelligence]], which is commonly implemented in [[computer system]]s using [[Computer program|programs]] and, sometimes, appropriate [[Computer hardware|hardware]].

== History of the term ==
{{Main|Nous}}
"''[[wikt:intelligence#English|Intelligence]]''" derives from the Latin [[noun]]s ''[[wikt:intelligentia|intelligentia]]'' or ''[[wikt:intellectus|intellēctus]]'', which in turn stem from the verb ''[[wikt:intelligere|intelligere]]'', to comprehend or perceive. In the [[Middle Ages]], ''intellectus'' became the scholarly technical term for understanding, and a translation for the Greek philosophical term ''[[nous]]''. This term, however, was strongly linked to the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[cosmology|cosmological]] theories of [[teleology|teleological]] [[scholasticism]], including theories of the immortality of the soul, and the concept of the [[Active Intellect]] (also known as the Active Intelligence). This entire approach to the study of nature was strongly rejected by the [[early modern era|early modern]] philosophers such as [[Francis Bacon]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], and [[David Hume]], all of whom preferred the word "understanding" (in place of "''intellectus''" or "intelligence") in their English philosophical works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maich|page=305|title=A Hobbes Dictionary|first=Aloysius|publisher=Blackwell|year=1995|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes for example, in his Latin ''[[De Corpore]]'', used "''intellectus intelligit''", translated in the English version as "the understanding understandeth", as a typical example of a logical [[absurdity]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/englishworkstho21hobbgoog#page/n83/mode/1up/search/understanding English version] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311180815/https://archive.org/stream/englishworkstho21hobbgoog |date=11 March 2014 }} [https://archive.org/stream/thomhobbesmalme03molegoog#page/n184/mode/1up/search/intellectus Latin version] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105204954/http://www.archive.org/stream/thomhobbesmalme03molegoog |date=5 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "intelligence" has therefore become less common in English language philosophy, but it has later been taken up (with the scholastic theories which it now implies) in more contemporary [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;This paragraph almost verbatim from {{cite book|last1=Goldstein|first1=Sam|last2=Princiotta|first2=Dana|last3=Naglieri|first3=Jack A., Eds.|title=Handbook of Intelligence: Evolutionary Theory, Historical Perspective, and Current Concepts|date=2015|publisher=Springer|location=New York, Heidelberg, Dordrecht, London|isbn=978-1-4939-1561-3|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
The [[definition]] of intelligence is controversial.&lt;ref name="LeggHutter2007"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some groups of [[psychology|psychologists]] have suggested the following definitions:

From "[[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]]" (1994), an [[op-ed]] statement in the Wall Street Journal signed by fifty-two researchers (out of 131 total invited to sign):&lt;ref name="Gottfredson 1970688887 17–20"&gt;{{harvnb|Gottfredson|1997777|pp=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|A very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience. It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings—"catching on," "making sense" of things, or "figuring out" what to do.&lt;ref name=Gottfredson1997&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gottfredson |first=Linda S. |year=1997 |authorlink=Linda Gottfredson |title=Mainstream Science on Intelligence (editorial) |journal=Intelligence |issn=0160-2896 |volume=24 |pages=13–23 |url=http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997mainstream.pdf |ref=harv |doi=10.1016/s0160-2896(97)90011-8 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222052006/http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997mainstream.pdf |archivedate=22 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From ''[[Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns]]'' (1995), a report published by the Board of Scientific Affairs of the [[American Psychological Association]]:
{{quote|Individuals differ from one another in their ability to understand complex ideas, to adapt effectively to the environment, to learn from experience, to engage in various forms of reasoning, to overcome obstacles by taking thought. Although these individual differences can be substantial, they are never entirely consistent: a given person's intellectual performance will vary on different occasions, in different domains, as judged by different criteria. Concepts of "intelligence" are attempts to clarify and organize this complex set of phenomena. Although considerable clarity has been achieved in some areas, no such conceptualization has yet answered all the important questions, and none commands universal assent. Indeed, when two dozen prominent theorists were recently asked to define intelligence, they gave two dozen, somewhat different, definitions.&lt;ref name=Neisser1998&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Neisser |first1=Ulrich |last2=Boodoo |first2=Gwyneth |last3=Bouchard |first3=Thomas J. |last4=Boykin |first4=A.

"Intelligence is a force, F, that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action. It acts to maximize future freedom of action, or keep options open, with some strength T, with the diversity of possible accessible futures, S, up to some future time horizon, τ. In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped".

== Human intelligence ==
{{Main|Human intelligence}}

Human intelligence is the intellectual power of humans, which is marked by complex [[cognition|cognitive]] feats and high levels of [[motivation]] and [[self-awareness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tirri, Nokelainen|title=Measuring Multiple Intelligences and Moral Sensitivities in Education|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-6091-758-5|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789460917585|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802041535/http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789460917585|archivedate=2 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intelligence enables humans to remember descriptions of things and use those descriptions in future behaviors. It is a cognitive process. It gives humans the [[cognition|cognitive]] abilities to [[learning|learn]], [[Concept learning|form concepts]], [[understanding|understand]], and [[reason]], including the capacities to [[pattern recognition|recognize patterns]], comprehend ideas, [[planning|plan]], [[problem solving|solve problems]], and use [[language]] to [[Human communication|communicate]]. Intelligence enables humans to [[experience]] and [[thought|think]].

Note that much of the above definition applies also to the intelligence of non-human animals.

[[File:Chimpanzee and stick.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The common [[chimpanzee]] can [[Tool use by animals|use tools]]. This chimpanzee is using a stick to get food.]]

Although humans have been the primary focus of intelligence researchers, scientists have also attempted to investigate animal intelligence, or more broadly, animal [[cognition]]. These researchers are interested in studying both mental ability in a particular [[species]], and comparing abilities between species. They study various measures of problem solving, as well as numerical and verbal reasoning abilities. Some challenges in this area are defining intelligence so that it has the same meaning across species (e.g. comparing intelligence between literate humans and illiterate animals), and also [[operational definition|operationalizing]] a measure that accurately compares mental ability across different species and contexts.

[[Wolfgang Köhler]]'s research on the intelligence of apes is an example of research in this area. Stanley Coren's book, ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs]]'' is a notable book on the topic of dog intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Coren |first=Stanley |title=The Intelligence of Dogs |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=0-553-37452-4 |year=1995 |oclc=30700778}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also: [[Dog intelligence]].) Non-human animals particularly noted and studied for their intelligence include [[chimpanzee]]s, [[bonobo]]s (notably the language-using [[Kanzi]]) and other [[great ape]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[elephant]]s and to some extent [[parrot]]s, [[Rat#Intelligence|rats]] and [[raven]]s.

[[Cephalopod intelligence]] also provides important comparative study. [[Cephalopod]]s appear to exhibit characteristics of significant intelligence, yet their [[nervous system]]s differ radically from those of backboned animals. Vertebrates such as [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[fish]] have shown a fairly high degree of intellect that varies according to each species. The same is true with [[arthropod]]s.

=== ''g'' factor in non-humans ===
{{main|g Factor in Non-Humans}}

Evidence of a general factor of intelligence has been observed in non-human animals. The general factor of intelligence, or [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], is a [[psychometric]] construct that summarizes the correlations observed between an individual's scores on a wide range of [[cognitive abilities]]. First described in [[humans]], the ''g'' factor has since been identified in a number of non-human species.&lt;ref name="Reader"&gt;Reader, S. M., Hager, Y., &amp; Laland, K. N. (2011). The evolution of primate general and cultural intelligence. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 366(1567), 1017-1027.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive ability and intelligence cannot be measured using the same, largely verbally dependent, scales developed for humans. Instead, intelligence is measured using a variety of interactive and observational tools focusing on [[innovation]], [[habit]] reversal, [[social learning theory|social learning]], and responses to [[novelty]]. Studies have shown that ''g'' is responsible for 47% of the individual variance in cognitive ability measures in [[primates]]&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt; and between 55% and 60% of the variance in [[mus musculus|mice]] (Locurto, Locurto). These values are similar to the accepted variance in [[IQ]] explained by ''g'' in humans (40-50%).&lt;ref&gt;Kamphaus, R. W. (2005). Clinical assessment of child and adolescent intelligence. Springer Science &amp; Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In plants ==
{{Main|Plant perception (physiology)#Plant intelligence|l1=Plant intelligence}}

It has been argued that plants should also be classified as intelligent based on their ability to sense and model external and internal environments and adjust their [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[plant physiology|physiology]] and [[phenotypic plasticity|phenotype]] accordingly to ensure self-preservation and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Trewavas |first=Anthony |date = September 2005|title=Green plants as intelligent organisms |journal=Trends in Plant Science |pmid=16054860 |volume=10 |issue=9 |pages=413–419 |doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2005.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| page = 841| year = 2002| pmid = 11859344| doi = 10.1038/415841a| issue = 6874| volume = 415| title = Mindless mastery| journal = Nature| last1 = Trewavas | first1 = A.| bibcode = 2002Natur.415..841T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A counter argument is that intelligence is commonly understood to involve the creation and use of persistent memories as opposed to computation that does not involve learning. If this is accepted as definitive of intelligence, then it includes the artificial intelligence of robots capable of "machine learning", but excludes those purely autonomic sense-reaction responses that can be observed in many plants. Plants are not limited to automated sensory-motor responses, however, they are capable of discriminating positive and negative experiences and of 'learning' (registering memories) from their past experiences. They are also capable of communication, accurately computing their circumstances, using sophisticated [[cost–benefit analysis]] and taking tightly controlled actions to mitigate and control the diverse environmental stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Goh | first1 = C.

Artificial intelligence (or AI) is both the intelligence of machines and the branch of [[computer science]] which aims to create it, through "the study and design of [[intelligent agents]]"&lt;ref name=Poole&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Goebel, Randy |author2=Poole, David L. |author3=Mackworth, Alan K. |title=Computational intelligence: A logical approach |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1997 |page=1 |isbn=0-19-510270-3 |url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/spider/poole/ci/ch1.pdf |format=pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307184018/http://www.cs.ubc.ca/spider/poole/ci/ch1.pdf |archivedate=7 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "rational agents", where an [[intelligent agent]] is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success.&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Russell, Stuart J. |author2=Norvig, Peter |title=Artificial intelligence: A modern approach |publisher=Prentice Hall |location= Englewood Cliffs, N.J. |year=2003 |isbn=0-13-790395-2 |oclc=51325314}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Progress in artificial intelligence|Achievements in artificial intelligence]] include constrained and well-defined problems such as games, [[crossword]]-solving and [[optical character recognition]] and a few more general problems such as [[autonomous cars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/520746/data-shows-googles-robot-cars-are-smoother-safer-drivers-than-you-or-i/|title=Google: Our Robot Cars Are Better Drivers Than Puny Humans|first=Tom|last=Simonite|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; General intelligence or [[Artificial general intelligence|strong AI]] has not yet been achieved and is a long-term goal of AI research.

{{Main|Jealousy}}

'''Jealousy in art''' deals with the way writers and graphic artists have approached the topic of jealousy in their works.

Jealousy is the powerful complex of emotions experienced at the loss, real or imagined, of something or someone you believe is yours, whereas envy concerns what you don’t have and would like to possess. Othello is filled with jealousy at the thought of losing Desdemona: Iago is consumed with envy of Othello’s prestige. Because jealous lovers tell multiple stories about those who arouse their jealousy, and because the emotion is so corrosive, jealousy is a common theme in literature and art, not to mention opera and cinema.

==Literature==
Literary works use a variety of devices to explore its possibilities and reveal its wider implications. Most famously, perhaps, Schahriar's destructive jealousy in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' is what precipitates Scheherazade’s creative outpouring of stories. In [[Ariosto]]’s ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' (1516) jealousy leads to such a distortion of the world that the sufferer is driven to madness. [[Shakespeare]]'s later play, ''the Winters tale'' (1613) is predominately about the jealousy felt by Leontes' and his supposed adulterous wife. [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]’s Princess Brambilla (1821) is more concerned with the interplay between jealousy and the theater, between reality and masks. In [[Charlotte Brontë]]’s ''Villette'' (1853) jealousy becomes a game of reflections and speculations, a potent denial of sexual stereotypes, and, like many novels written by women, an angry rejection of the violation of the individual caused by the gaze of the jealous lover. [[Anthony Trollope]] uses both ''He Knew He Was Right'' (1869) and ''Kept in the Dark'' (1882) to analyze not only double standards used to judge how men and women behave but also the relationship between mind and body. [[Tolstoy]]’s ''[[The Kreutzer Sonata]]'' (1889) offers a compelling exploration of jealousy acting as a front for repressed [[homosexuality]]. [[Proust]]’s ''In Search of Lost Time'' (1913–1927), especially the section concerning Albertine, represents the claustrophobic nature of the passion of jealousy through the tropes of imprisonment, illness and death, while [[Michal Choromanski]]’s ''Jealousy and Medicine'' (1932) creates a landscape and a climate that recreate to the full the physical experience of jealousy. [[Freud]]’s reading of jealousy and his emphasis on repetitive structures inspires [[Iris Murdoch]]’s ''A Word Child'' (1975) in which the [[London]] subway symbolizes endless repetition of the same.

Other novelists have used jealousy to explore the relationship between writer and reader, as well as that between fiction and reality. [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]]’s ''Jealousy'' (1965) develops the image of the window blind (in [[French language|French]] “la jalousie” means both the emotion and the window blind) to lock the reader into the jealous person’s mind, while in [[Julian Barnes]]’s ''Talking it Over'' (1991), the writer’s jealousy of the reader’s attention is as much a part of the story as the sexual jealousy it also examines. [[A. S. Byatt]]’s ''Possession'' (1990) is in part an analysis of the ways in which writing and reading operate to silence other voices.

In art, depicting a face reflecting the ravages of jealousy was a frequent studio exercise: see for instance drawings by [[Charles Le Brun]] (1619–1690) or [[Sébastien Leclerc (1676-1763)|Sébastien Leclerc]] (the Younger) (1676–1763), or in a fuller treatment, the howling figure on the left in [[Bronzino]]’s ''An Allegory with Venus and Cupid'' (probably 1540-50). [[Albrecht Dürer]]’s 1498 drawing, ''Hercules’s Jealousy'' depicts jealousy as a powerfully built woman armed with a sword. The theme of jealousy is frequently conveyed through images of the gaze as in [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]]’s ''Paolo and Francesca'' (1819) which reveals the jealous husband’s gaze catching the young lovers’ first kiss. [[Edvard Munch]]’s many depictions of jealousy, however, tend to place the husband at the front of the painting with a couple behind him as if to suggest that jealousy is created more by the mind than by the gaze. This suggestion is intensified by his cunning use of symbolic colors. There are, nevertheless, lighter moments, as when [[Gaston de La Touche]] (1854–1913), in ''Jealousy or the Monkey'' shows a love scene interrupted by a monkey tugging on the woman’s dress. While popular images of jealousy tend to the lurid, it remains a source, both in literature and in painting, of highly creative artistic strategies that have little to do with the negative and destructive sides of the emotion itself.

'''Kresh''' is a small language group of [[South Sudan]]. It is generally considered to be a branch of the [[Central Sudanic languages]]. Boyeldieu (2010) judges that this has yet to be demonstrated satisfactorily,&lt;ref name="Glottolog" /&gt; but Starostin (2016) finds convincing evidence, and that its closest relative within that family appears to be [[Birri language|Birri]]. 

Kresh is generally considered a [[dialect cluster]], but it is dialectically diverse. Blench (2000 ms) lists five Kresh languages, four of which (Kresh, Gbaya, Woro, and Dongo) ''Ethnologue'' counts among seven dialects of Kresh/Gbaya (or eight, counting Aja). Kresh and Gbaya, however, are merely [[exonym]] and [[endonym]], not coherent languages; they are equivalent to five varieties listed by ''Ethnologue''. ''Ethnologue'' notes that the varieties are not [[mutually intelligible]], but that Kresh-Ndogo (Gbaya-Ndogo) is universally understood as a [[prestige dialect|prestige variety]], and that Naka is also commonly understood as the most populous variety. Blench (2000) also includes [[Furu language|Furu]] (Bagero) as a Kresh language, though ''Ethnologue'' classifies it as [[Kara languages|Kara]].

In addition, [[Aja language (Nilo-Saharan)|Aja]] is spoken by ethnic Kresh, but though it remains Kresh grammatically, it has been [[relexification|relexified]] by the unrelated [[Banda languages]] (Santandrea 1976).&lt;ref name="Glottolog" /&gt;

==Languages==
Blench (2000, 2012) distinguishes ''Kresh, Woro, Gbaya, Furu, Dongo,'' and ''Aja''. However, the principal Kresh 'dialects' are not mutually intelligible, and ''Ethnologue'' lists them as ''Naka (Kresh-Boro), Gbaya-Ndogo (Kresh-Ndogo), Gbaya-Ngbongbo (Kresh-Hofra), Gbaya-Gboko, Orlo (Woro), Gbaya-Dara,'' and ''Dongo'' (with Furu and Aja listed separately):

*[[Aja language (Nilo-Saharan)|Aja]]
*[[Kresh language|Kresh-Ndogo]] (Gbaya-Ndogo)
*[[Naka language|Naka]] (Kresh-Boro)
*[[Kresh-Hofra]] (Gbaya-Ngbongbo)
*[[Gboko language|Gboko]] (Gbaya-Gboko)
*[[Dara language|Dara]] (Gbaya-Dara)
*[[Woro language|Woro]] (Orlo)
*[[Dongo language (Nilo-Saharan)|Dongo]]
*[[Furu language|Furu]]

The names ''Gbaya'' and ''Dongo'' are ambiguous, as they are also used for unrelated [[Ubangian languages]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23583">'''Latin American studies''' ('''LAS''') is an academic and [[research]] field associated with the study of [[Latin America]]. The [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] study is a subfield of [[area studies]], and can be composed of numerous disciplines such as [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[History|history,]] [[International relations|international relations,]] [[political science]], [[geography]], [[gender studies]], and [[Literature|literature.]] 

==Definition==
Latin American studies critically examines the [[history]], [[culture]], [[international relations]], and [[politics]], of [[Latin America]]. It is not to be confused with [[Latino studies|Latino Studies]], an academic discipline which studies the experience of people of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic ancestry]] in the United States.

Latin Americanists consider a variety of perspectives and employ diverse research tools in their work. The interdisciplinary disciplines of study varies, depending on the school, association, and academic program. For example, the Latin American Centre of the School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies (SIAS) at the [[University of Oxford]] heavily focuses on the social sciences, such as the economics, politics, and development of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lac.ox.ac.uk/msc-latin-american-studies-msc-las|title=MSc Latin American Studies (MSc LAS) {{!}} Latin American Centre|website=www.lac.ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, schools like Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies (LLILAS) at [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]], focus on the humanities; with the language, culture, and history of Latin America as a central component&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/llilas/student-programs/graduate-program/overview.php|title=UT College of Liberal Arts:|website=liberalarts.utexas.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Others include the study of [[Environmental studies|environment]] and [[ecology]] of the region.

Latin American studies is usually quite open and often includes or is closely associated with, for instance, [[Development studies]], [[Geography]], [[Anthropology]], [[Caribbean]] studies, and [[Transatlantic studies]].

==History==
Latin America has been studied in one way or another ever since Columbus's voyage of 1492.  In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, scientist explorers such as [[Alexander von Humboldt]] published extensively about the region.  Towards the end of the nineteenth century and at the turn of the twentieth, within the region itself writers such as [[José Martí]] and [[José Enrique Rodó]] encouraged a consciousness of regional identity.

In 1875, the [[International Congress of Americanists]] held its first meeting in Nancy, France, and has met regularly ever since, alternating between venues in Europe and in the Western hemisphere. However, unlike the scholarly organizations of the twentieth century, the ICA does not have an ongoing organization, nor is there a journal of the ICA. The creation of formal and ongoing scholarly organizations focusing on Latin America is a product of the twentieth century.

In the US, historians with an interest in [[Latin American history]] within the [[American Historical Association]] created a group focusing on Latin America. In 1918, they founded ''[[The Hispanic American Historical Review]]'', which has published quarterly since that time and has built a reputation as one of the premier scholarly journals.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://hahr.dukejournals.org/ homepage ]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Latin Americanists within the AHA created the [[Conference on Latin American History]] in 1926, which is now separately incorporated (since 1964), but continues to coordinate its annual meetings with the American Historical Association.  In 1936, US Latin Americanists also founded the ''[[Handbook of Latin American Studies]],'' with editorial offices in the Hispanic Division of the [[Library of Congress]]. In a pre-digital era, the compilation of annotated bibliographic references in the humanities and social science organized by subject and country was a vital tool for scholars in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "The Latin American Studies Association: A Summary Survey with Appendix," ''[[Latin American Research Review]]'', Vol 2 No. 1, (Autumn, 1966) pp. 57-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://salalm.org/Conf/2016/04/panel-11-the-hispanic-division-and-the-handbook-of-latin-american-studies-highlighting-luso-hispanic-collections-in-the-library-of-congress/ accessed 13 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959, the US government began seriously focusing on Latin America as [[Cuba]] and the hemisphere was seen to be an integral element of [[Cold War]] politics.  The Latin American historian who wrote the early history of the founding of the [[Latin American Studies Association]] wryly suggested in 1966 that at some future date Latin Americanists should erect a statue to [[Fidel Castro]], the "remote godfather" of the field, who instigated a renewed US interest in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "The Latin American Studies Association: A Summary Survey with Appendix," ''Latin American Research Review'', Vol. 2, No. 1 (Autumn 1966), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in Latin American studies increased starting in the 1950s. In the US, Latin American studies (like other [[area studies]]) was boosted by the passing of Title VI of the [[National Defense Education Act]] (NDEA) of 1958, which provided resources for Centers of Area and International Studies.[http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/iegps/history.html]  In the UK, the 1965 "Parry Report"{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} provided similar impetus for the establishment of Institutes and Centres of Latin American Studies at Oxford, London, Cambridge, and Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;José C. Moya,ed. ''The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History'', New York: Oxford University Press 2011, p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Canada, [[York University]] in Toronto established the first Latin American center, "in part thanks to the inflow of exiled intellectuals from South America."&lt;ref&gt;Moya, ''The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History'', p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's [[Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut]] in Berlin had been founded in 1930, but not until the 1970s did it experience expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Moya, ''The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History'', p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lochmaben Stone''' ({{gbmapping|NY 3123 6600}}) is a [[megalith]] standing in a field, nearly a mile west of the [[River Sark|Sark]] mouth on the [[Solway Firth]], three hundred yards or so above high water mark on the farm of Old Graitney in [[Dumfries &amp; Galloway]] in Scotland. The area is also known as Stormont. Together with a smaller stone it is all that is left of a [[stone circle]] dating back to around 3000BC.

The principal stone or megalith, referred to as the Lochmabonstone by Logan Mack&lt;ref name="Mack"&gt;Mack, James Logan (1926). ''The Border Line.'' Pub. Oliver &amp; Boyd.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1926, has, in [[the Borders]] context, an unsurpassed extent of history attached to it. It is an erratic, 7 feet high and 18 feet in girth and weighs approximately ten tons. It is composed of weathered granite, exposed to severe glacial action.

In these treeless flatlands this stone, given its size, would have been a distinctive landmark on the flat Solway Plain for several millennia.

==Etymology==
[[File:Gretna 0003.jpg|thumb|200px|The principal Lochmaben Stone from the north.]]
The Lochmaben stone has had a wide range of names attached to it over the last few millennia or so. Lochmabonstone, Stormont, and Old Graitney stone are amongst the most recent. In 1398 the name is 'Clochmabenstane', in 1409 and 1472 the name 'Loumabanestane' is recorded, with 'Lowmabanstane' used in 1485 and then 'Loughmabanestane' in 1494.&lt;ref name="Mack"&gt;Mack, James Logan (1926). ''The Border Line.'' Pub. Oliver &amp; Boyd.&lt;/ref&gt;

The element [[Mabon ap Modron|Mabon]], as in the Celtic god, is common to all of the variants and this strongly confirms this association, as well as helping with the identification of this site with the Roman site of 'Locus Maponi', as listed in the Ravenna Cosmography. It is also suggested that ''Locus Maponi'' means the 'Loch' or 'Pool' of Mabon and this would suggest that the town of [[Lochmaben]] is the intended named site.&lt;ref name="Moffat"/&gt;

''Maporitum'' is another name recorded in the cosmography and given that the name relates to the ''Ford of Mabon'' and indeed the name 'Solway' is most likely derived from the word ''Sul'' standing for the pillar or Lochmaben stone and the word ''Wath'' that is of Viking origin and means to 'wade', indicating a ford.&lt;ref name="Moffata"&gt;Moffat, Alistair (2014). ''The Faded Map. Lost Kingdoms of Scotland''. Edinburgh : Birlinn Ltd. {{ISBN|978-1-84158-958-9}}. P.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The old Gaelic 'Cloch' element is found with the 1398 record 'Clockmabanstane' and this suggests that as in the modern [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] 'clach', meaning stone, the whole name may mean the 'stone or burial place of Mabon'. With the decline of Gaelic use in this area so close to England, the word 'Loch' has become appended, especially as the [[Lochmaben]] and the [[Loch of Maben]] are in the locality. The name [[Clackmannan]] is another example where the Gaelic word is undeniably linked with a stone, in this case still on view in the town centre.

== Archaeology ==
The first edition [[Ordnance Survey]] six-inch map (1843–1882) refers to it as "[[Druid|Druidical circle]] (Remains of)", which the ''Ordnance Survey Name Book'' states as being formerly composed of nine upright stones placed in an oval of about {{convert|0.5|acre|m2}}. Only two of these stones are visible above the surface of the ground, one being the Lochmaben Stone.&lt;ref name="RCAHMS"&gt;[http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/pls/portal/newcanmore.newcandig_details_gis?inumlink=67441 The RCAHMS Canmore Database]&lt;/ref&gt; The other stone stands 1.0 m high by 1.2 m in diameter in a less conspicuous position in the nearby hedge to the north east of the larger stone. The 1845 'New Statistical Account' also relates that a ring of large stones once stood here, enclosing an area of around half an acre, most of which were removed shortly before that date to facilitate ploughing of the site.&lt;ref name="Maxwell, Sir Herbert 1896 p. 132"&gt;Maxwell, Sir Herbert (1896).'' A History of Dumfries and Galloway''. Edinburgh : William Blackwood &amp; Sons. p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 the stone fell over, and excavations prior to its re-erection revealed that it had been set into a shallow pit. No artifacts were recovered. However, a sample of mixed Oak and Hazel [[charcoal]] taken from the lower fill of the stone-pit yielded a [[radiocarbon date]] of approximately 3275 BC according to [[Aubrey Burl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruggles|first=Clive|title=Records in Stone: Papers in Memory of Alexander Thom|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-53130-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oZ3JGYd1kJoC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=Lochmaben+Stone&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1j4pT6atNcfa8AO2quHfAw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Lochmaben%20Stone&amp;f=false|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The cult of Maponus or Mabon==
[[File:Gretna 0005.jpg|thumb|200px|The smaller Lochmaben Stone incorporated into a hedge.]]
The name of the stone strongly suggests that this site was a centre of the cult of the Celtic god [[Mabon ap Modron|Mabon]] or Maponus. The name has its origins in ''map'', the Old Welsh for 'son of' and is suggestive of a divine youth.&lt;ref name="Moffat"&gt;Moffat, Alistair (2014). ''The Faded Map. Lost Kingdoms of Scotland''. Edinburgh : Birlinn Ltd. {{ISBN|978-1-84158-958-9}}. P.23.&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to have been the divine patron of the Kingdom of [[Rheged]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} and dedications to his cult have so far been found at Birrens, Brampton, Chesterholm (Vindolanda), Corbridge and Ribchester.&lt;ref name="Moffat"/&gt; Mabon may have been a god of fertility:{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} the Romans made him a British [[Apollo]].&lt;ref name="Moffat"/&gt; [[Tolstoy]] sees [[Merlin]] as a chief [[druid]] carrying out ceremonies at the Clochmabenstane.&lt;ref name="Begg"&gt;Begg, Ean &amp; Rich, Deike (1991). ''On the Trail of Merlin''. The Aquarian Press. {{ISBN|0-85030-939-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime during the seventh century, an unknown monk in the Monastery at [[Ravenna]] on the [[Adriatic]] (eastern) coast of [[Italy]] compiled a list of all the towns and road-stations throughout the [[Roman Empire]]; this important historical document has since become known as the [[Ravenna Cosmography]] and it lists a 'Locus Maponi' which has been tentatively identified with the Lochmaben stone site.&lt;ref name="Richmond"&gt;Richmond, I.A. (1958). ''Ancient geographical sources for Britain north of Cheviot''. Roman and Native in North Britain. Pub. Edinburgh. P.149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharpe"&gt;Sharp, Mick (1997). Holy Places of Celtic Britain. Blandford. {{ISBN|1-85079-315-8}}. P. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The border line and the Lochmaben Stone ==
The Lochmaben Stone was a well known, well recognised and easily located 'marker' on the Scottish Marches and as such it performed a number of functions prior to the Union of the Crowns,&lt;ref name="Mack"&gt;Mack, James Logan (1926). ''The Border Line.'' Pub. Oliver &amp; Boyd.&lt;/ref&gt; such as arrangements for truces, exchange of prisoners, etc.&lt;ref name="Maxwell, Sir Herbert 1896 p. 132"/&gt;

===Rendezvous===
Raiding parties met here before launching expeditions into England and Scottish armies assembled here before major incursions or defence operations took place. It may well have been a tribal assembly point. An army was ordered to assemble here as late as 6 February 1557.&lt;ref name="Maxwell1"&gt;Maxwell, Sir Herbert (1896).'' A History of Dumfries and Galloway''. Edinburgh : William Blackwood &amp; Sons. p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exchange of prisoners===
In 1398 an exchange of prisoners took place when English and Scots representatives, the Dukes of Rothesay and Lancaster&lt;ref name="Maxwell, Sir Herbert 1896 p. 132"/&gt; met at the Lochmaben Stone.&lt;ref name="Mack"&gt;Mack, James Logan (1926). ''The Border Line.'' Pub. Oliver &amp; Boyd.&lt;/ref&gt; The prisoners were released without ransoms and any that had already been paid were to be returned.&lt;ref name="Maxwell, Sir Herbert 1896 p. 132"/&gt;

===The Commissioners and the Wardens of the Western Marches===
Its use by the [[Marcher Lords]] or Wardens suggests that the Scots regarded the Lochmaben stone as being the southernmost limit of the Scottish realm. In 1398 an [[indenture]] was made at 'Clochmabenstane' for the men of [[Tyndale]] and [[Redesdale]] to meet from [[Whitsun]]day to [[Michaelmas]] at Kershope Bridge. The Commissioners not only met here, but "gave bail for their good behaviour to one another."

In 1473, the Scottish and English Ambassadors met to agree that more frequent meetings of the marcher Wardens were to be held at the six recognised sites on the marches. These were 'Newbyggynfurde, Redaneburn, Gammyllispethe, Belle, Loumabanestane and Kershopebrig and the meetings were to be held at successive venues. On the 26th. March 1494 the commissioners of both countries met at the Lochmaben Stone to finally settle the long running dispute over the 'Fish Garth' across the [[River Esk, Dumfries and Galloway|River Esk]].

== Recent history ==
In the 1800s the tenant of Old Graitney farm decided to clear his land of the three remaining stones which ruined his field's appearance and got in the way of his machinery. He set his farm hands to work digging deep pits for the burial of the stones. One had been completely buried and another partially sunken when the proprietor, [[Lord Mansfield]], arrived at the scene and stopped further operations.&lt;ref name="Mack"&gt;Mack, James Logan (1926). ''The Border Line.'' Pub. Oliver &amp; Boyd.&lt;/ref&gt; The stone was still used as a gathering place for the locality into comparatively recent times.&lt;ref name="Rae"&gt;Rae, T. I. (1966). ''Administration of the Scottish Frontier'', 1513 – 1603. P.50.&lt;/ref&gt;

A local tradition suggests that the stone was moved by a farm worker with an excavator, the intention being to locate any 'treasure' beneath. The local primary school attended an official re-erection ceremony which was covered by the local paper, the ''[[Dumfries and Galloway Standard]]'' 22 September 1995.

==The Battle of Sark or Lochmaben Stone==
The ''[[Auchinleck Chronicle]]'' records that on 23 October 1448 a Scottish Army under the command of [[Hugh Douglas, Earl of Ormonde]], and Sir John Wallace of Craigie won a resounding victory over the invading English forces of the younger [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland]]. There is nothing to mark the site of the battle ground. 3,000 Englishmen were slain or drowned in flight. Many prisoners were taken. Estimated Scots losses range from a low of 26 to a high of 600, the most serious of whom was Sir John Wallace of Craigie, Sheriff of [[Ayr]], who was mortally wounded, dying some time after the battle.&lt;ref name="Auchinleck"&gt;Auchinleck Chronicle. A Short Chronicle of the Reign of James the Second King of Scots.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous notes==

===The Old Graitney Boat Burial===
At NY 31 66 a Viking boat-shaped barrow or mound existed. It was levelled around the year 1851, but no burials or Viking artefacts are recorded as having been found.&lt;ref name="RCAHMS" /&gt;

===Old Graitney – The 'Auld House'===
This tower-house was built by the Johnstones in 1535 and burnt by the Maxwells in 1585. Locally a tower is said to have stood 180&amp;nbsp;m south of the Old Graitney Farmhouse although no traces are visible on the ground.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"&gt;MacFarlane, W. (1906–8). Geographical collections relating to Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Port Stormont===
This site at NY 316 660 is recorded as having been used by smugglers.&lt;ref name="Truckel"&gt;Graham, A. &amp; Truckell, A.E. (1977). ''Old Harbours in the Solway Firth.'' Trans. Dumf. Gall. Hist. Antiq. Soc. 3rd., V.52.&lt;/ref&gt; The title of [[Viscount Stormont]] is a title in the Peerage of Scotland created in 1621 by [[James VI]] for [[David Murray, 1st Viscount of Stormont|Sir David Murray]]. It is a subsidiary title of the [[Earl of Mansfield and Mansfield]]. The family held land in this area and no doubt some connection exists between the title and the area.

===Quern stone===
The upper stone of a rotary [[quern-stone|quern]] was found about 1976 when ploughing some 350&amp;nbsp;m SSW of Old Graitney farmhouse, where it is still held by the finder, Mr S Smith. Slightly oval in shape it measures about 30&amp;nbsp;cm in maximum diameter and is made of granite or a similar rock; there are both central and side-holes.&lt;ref name="RCAHMS" /&gt;

===King Arthur===
A local legend associates the Lochmaben Stone with the stone from which [[King Arthur]] pulled the sword [[Excalibur]]. However, this only agrees with some versions of the Arthurian legend. In other versions of the Arthurian legend, Excalibur was a sword that came from the water, and the sword in the stone does not have a name.&lt;ref name="King Artur"&gt;[http://www.scottishaccommodationindex.com/gretnapics.htm The King Arthur connection.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]] and the [[philosophy of mind]], a '''locutionary act''' is the performance of an [[utterance]], and hence of a [[speech act]]. The term equally refers to the surface meaning of an utterance because, according to [[J. L. Austin]]'s posthumous "How To Do Things With Words", a speech act should be analysed as a locutionary act (''i.e.'' the actual utterance and its ostensible meaning, comprising phonetic, phatic and rhetic acts corresponding to the verbal, syntactic and semantic aspects of any meaningful utterance), as well as an [[illocutionary act]] (the semantic '[[illocutionary force]]' of the utterance, thus its real, intended meaning), and in certain cases a further [[perlocutionary act]] (''i.e.'' its actual effect, whether intended or not).

==Example==
For example, the phrase "Don't go into the water" (a locutionary act with distinct phonetic, syntactic and semantic features) counts as warning to the listener not to go into the water (an illocutionary act). If the listener heeds the warning the speech-act has been successful in persuading the listener not to go into the water (a perlocutionary act). This taxonomy of speech acts was inherited by [[John R. Searle]], Austin's pupil at Oxford and subsequently an influential exponent of speech act theory.

The '''Minoan language''' is the language (or languages) of the ancient [[Minoan civilization]] of [[Crete]] written in the [[Cretan hieroglyphs]] and later in the [[Linear A]] syllabary. As the Cretan hieroglyphs are undeciphered and Linear A only partly deciphered, the Minoan language is unknown and unclassified: indeed, with the existing evidence, it seems impossible to be certain that the two scripts record the same language, or even that a single language is recorded in each. The [[Eteocretan language]], attested in a few alphabetic inscriptions from Crete 1,000 years later, is possibly a descendant of Minoan, but it is itself unclassified.

==Tradition==
Minoan is mainly known from the inscriptions in Linear A, which are fairly legible by comparison with [[Linear B]]. The Cretan hieroglyphs are dated from the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE. The Linear A texts, mostly written in clay tablets, are spread all over Crete with more than 40 localities on the island. 

===The Egyptian texts===
From the 18th dynasty of Egypt there are four texts containing names and sayings in the [[Keftiu language]] ([[:de:Keftiu|de]]). They are, as usual in non-Egyptian texts, written in Egyptian hieroglyphs, which allow a more precise pronunciation.
*Magic Papyrus Harris (Papyrus magicus Harris XII, 1-5); Beg. 18th dynasty: a saying in the Keftiu language &lt;ref&gt;H. Lange: ''Der Magische Papyrus Harris''; Kopenhagen (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Writing board (B.M. 5647); early 18th dynasty: school blackboard with Keftiu name&lt;ref&gt;T. E. Peet: ''The Egyptian Writing-Board B.M. 5647 bearing Keftiu Names''; Oxford 1927&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[London Medical Papyrus]] (B.M., 10059); End of the 18th Dynasty: Two Sayings Against Disease (# 32-33)
*Aegean placard list ([[:de:Liste ägäischer Ortsnamen vom Totentempel Amenophis III|de]]): some Cretan place names.

On the basis of these texts, the phonetic system of the Minoan language can be developed, which has the following phonemes:&lt;ref&gt;Evangelos Kyriakidis: ''Indications on the Nature of the Language of the Keftiw from Egyptian Sources''. In: Ägypten und Levante / Egypt and the Levant Band 12 (2002), S. 211–219.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mombum languages''' are a pair of [[Trans–New Guinea languages]], [[Koneraw language|Koneraw]] and [[Mombum language|Mombum]], spoken just off the southern coast of New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/newguineaworld/families/trans-new-guinea/asmat-marianne-strait/marianne-strait New Guinea World, Marianne Strait]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mombum was first classified as a branch isolate of the [[Central and South New Guinea languages]] in [[Stephen Wurm]]'s 1975 expansion for Trans–New Guinea, a position tentatively maintained by [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]], though he cannot tell if the similarities are shared innovations or retentions from [[protolanguage|proto]]-TNG. Usher instead links them to the [[Asmat languages]].&lt;ref name=Usher/&gt; Koneraw is clearly related to Mombum, but was overlooked by early classifications. Along with the [[Kolopom languages]], they are the languages spoken on [[Yos Sudarso Island]] (Kolopom Island).

'''''Mortal Kombat''''' is an American series of [[Martial arts film|martial arts]] [[action film]]s based on the fighting video game series ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' by [[Midway Games]].

==Films==

===''Mortal Kombat'' (1995)===
{{main|Mortal Kombat (1995 film)}}
Three unknown martial artists are summoned to a mysterious island to compete in a tournament whose outcome will decide the fate of the world.

===''Mortal Kombat: Annihilation'' (1997)===
{{main|Mortal Kombat: Annihilation}}
A group of martial arts warriors have only six days to save the Earth from an extra-dimensional invasion.

===Cancelled sequel===
[[Threshold Entertainment]]'s production on a sequel was initially scheduled to commence shortly after the release of ''Mortal Kombat: Annihilation'', but it was shelved due to ''Annihilation's'' poor reception and disappointing box-office performance. It consequently never got off the ground as it remained stuck in [[development hell]] for over ten years, with numerous script rewrites and story changes, along with the 2005 destruction of [[New Orleans]] by [[Hurricane Katrina]], which greatly affected one of the planned shooting locations.&lt;ref name="mink interview"&gt;{{cite news|author=Clint Morris |title=Director talks ''Mortal Kombat'' reboot |publisher=Moviehole.net |date=2008-02-08 |url=http://www.moviehole.net/news/20080208_director_talks_mortal_kombat_r.htmlOr |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120808020206/http://www.moviehole.net/news/20080208_director_talks_mortal_kombat_r.htmlOr |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-08 |accessdate=2008-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2009, a bankruptcy court lawsuit saw Lawrence Kasanoff suing [[Midway Games|Midway]] while mentioning that a third film was in the works. [[Warner Bros.]] (which became the parent of New Line Cinema in 2008, after over a decade of both operating as separate divisions of [[Time Warner]]) ended up purchasing most of Midway's assets, including ''Mortal Kombat'', the next month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=WB Picks Up Rights to Midway Video Games|publisher=Comingsoon.net|date=2009-07-06|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=56887|accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, actors [[Chris Casamassa]] ([[Scorpion |Scorpion]]) and [[Linden Ashby]] ([[Johnny Cage]]) separately announced that they would be reprising their respective roles from the original film, with Casamassa additionally claiming that filming would begin in September of that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Polybren|title=Third Mortal Kombat movie filming in September - Report|publisher=GameSpot.com|date=2009-07-08|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/blogs/sidebar/909182374/26950479/third-mortal-kombat-movie-filming-in-september-report.html|accessdate=2009-07-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712140445/http://www.gamespot.com/news/blogs/sidebar/909182374/26950479/third-mortal-kombat-movie-filming-in-september-report.html|archivedate=2009-07-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Linden Ashby talks about Mortal Kombat |url=http://www.truveo.com/Linden-Ashby-talks-about-Mortal-Kombat-3/id/282147513}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the project still did not commence production, and aside from a poll that asked fans to vote on which major character they believed would die in the third movie, no official information on the project ever existed on the ''Mortal Kombat'' website hosted by Threshold, which itself permanently ceased updates in late 2004.&lt;ref name="MKsite"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mortalkombat.com/index-film.shtml |title=Threshold Entertainment |publisher=mortalkombat.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106215855/http://www.mortalkombat.com/index-film.shtml |archivedate=2012-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reboot===
In September 2011, it was reported that [[New Line Cinema]] (''Mortal Kombat'' film rights holders), sister studio to [[Warner Bros.]] (current franchise holders), had hired [[Kevin Tancharoen]] to direct a new feature-length film with the intention of aiming for an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R rating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/09/29/mortal-kombat-movie-kevin-tancharoen-new-line/ |title=New 'Mortal Kombat' movie 'needs to feel brutal,' says director|publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=2011-09-29 |accessdate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oren Uziel, who wrote Tancharoen's 2010 short film ''[[Mortal Kombat: Rebirth]]'', was hired as the screenwriter while no actors nor other crew were confirmed. Reports stated that the film would not be an extension of the games nor Tancharoen's then-current ''[[Mortal Kombat: Legacy]]'' web series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/mortal-kombat-video-game-headed-242218 |title='Mortal Kombat' Video Game Headed Back to the Big Screen|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |date=2011-09-29 |accessdate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shooting was expected to begin in March 2012 with a budget of well under $100 million and a release date of 2013,&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2011/09/30/glee-director-prepares-for-mortal-kombat-film/ |title=‘Glee’ director prepares for ‘Mortal Kombat’ film|publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=2011-09-30 |accessdate=2011-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/09/mortal-kombat-movie-coming-as-warner-video-game-and-new-line-units-partner.html |title=New 'Mortal Kombat' movie coming via partnership of Warner units|publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=2011-09-29 |accessdate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was ultimately delayed due to budget constraints, and Tancharoen started working on the second season of ''Legacy'' until problems with the film had been sorted out. However, in October 2013, Tancharoen quit the film production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KTANCH/statuses/393872867852435456?screen_name=KTANCH |title=Twitter / KTANCH: After 3 years of Kombat,I've |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2013-10-25 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 2015, [[James Wan]] signed on as producer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/469707-mortal-kombat-movie-james-wan-to-produce|title=Mortal Kombat Movie: James Wan to Produce|publisher=comingsoon.net|date=2015-08-07 |accessdate=2015-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in November 2016, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Simon McQuoid was hired as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/mortal-kombat-reboot-director-simon-mcquoid-james-wan-1201921068/|title=‘Mortal Kombat’ Reboot Finds Director in Simon McQuoid (EXCLUSIVE)|publisher=Variety|last=Kroll|first=Justin|date=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mount Taupiri''' is a hill at the southern end of the Taupiri Range in the [[Waikato]]. The highest peak in the range, it rises to 288 metres above sea level and overlooks [[Taupiri]] township immediately to its south. It is separated from the [[Hakarimata Range|Hākarimata Range]] to the south by the Taupiri Gorge, through which the [[Waikato River]] flows from the [[Waikato Plains|Waikato Basin]] to the Lower Waikato. The Mangawara Stream joins the Waikato River at the base of the hill.

Mount Taupiri is a sacred mountain and burial ground for the [[Waikato (iwi)|Waikato tribe]] of the [[Māori people]].&lt;ref name=Swarbrick5&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/waikato-places/5 |title=Waikato places - Ngāruawāhia |first= Nancy |last=Swarbrick |work=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until sometime in the 19th century a large Māori village or town, Kaitotehe, stood on the flat land on the other side of the river, below the Hākarimata Range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1934 |title=Introduction |journal=The New Zealand Railways Magazine |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages= |url= http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Gov09_06Rail-t1-body-d7-d0.html |accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early years it was the home of Paoa, brother of Mahuta, before Paoa moved to Hauraki.&lt;ref name=Kelly_1940/&gt; It became the headquarters of the [[Ngāti Mahuta]] people.&lt;ref name=TCP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waikatodistrict.govt.nz/CMSFiles/aa/aa91cbca-b445-48fc-87a4-58f4af75d824.pdf|title=Taupiri Community Plan 2008 - 2018|date=|work=|publisher=Waikato District Council|accessdate=22 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211235511/http://waikatodistrict.govt.nz/CMSFiles/aa/aa91cbca-b445-48fc-87a4-58f4af75d824.pdf|archivedate=11 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brothers Whare and Tapuae, grandsons of Mahuta and the leaders of Ngāti Mahuta, lived there. After the two brothers were killed, Tapuae's son Te Putu built Taupiri [[pā (Māori)|pā]] on the summit of a spur of Taupiri mountain, in the 1600s. When Te Putu was an old man in the 1700s, he was treacherously killed by Ngātokowaru of [[Ngāti Raukawa]] at Te Mata-o-tutonga, his home outside the pā by the banks of the Waikato River. He was buried at the pā, which thus became [[tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] (sacred) and was abandoned. Early European travellers in the area were obliged by Māori to cross to the other side of the Waikato River to avoid the sacred area.&lt;ref name=Kelly_1940&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kelly |first1=Leslie G. |authorlink=Leslie George Kelly |year=1940 |title=Taupiri pa |journal=The Journal of the Polynesian Society |volume=49 |issue=193 |pages=148–59 |url= http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/Volume_49_1940/Volume_49,_No._193/Taupiri_Pa,_by_Leslie_G._Kelly,_p_148-159/p1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century Kaitotehe was the home of [[Pōtatau Te Wherowhero]], the paramount chief of Ngāti Mahuta who became the first [[Māori King Movement|Māori King]]. English explorer and artist [[George French Angas]] visited Kaitotehe in 1844 and painted a scene depicting a ''[[Hui (Māori assembly)|hui]]'' (meeting) taking place in the village. Taupiri mountain is seen in the background on the other side of the Waikato River (which is not visible below the far palisade). The lower peak on the far right shows signs of the terraces of Te Putu's abandoned pā. To its left, in about the middle of the painting, is a still-lower bush-clad hill, which was the burial ground in Te Putu's time and below which his home of Te Mata-o-tutonga stood.&lt;ref name=Kelly_1940/&gt;

The present-day burial ground is directly above [[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]] and the [[North Island Main Trunk]] railway line on a steep slope. Parking and access is difficult, because the road and railway lie largely on land at the foot of the slope that has been reclaimed from the river. The deceased Māori kings and queen are buried in the highest part of the cemetery, on the summit where Te Putu's pā stood.

==Notable people buried there==

'''Ngaruawahia''' ([[Māori language|Māori]]: ''Ngāruawāhia''; {{IPA-mi|ŋaːɾʉaˈwaːhia}}) is a town in the [[Waikato]] region of the [[North Island]] of New Zealand. It is located {{convert|20|km}} north-west of [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] at the confluence of the [[Waikato River|Waikato]] and [[Waipa River]]s, adjacent to the [[Hakarimata Range]]. Ngaruawahia lies within the [[Hamilton Urban Area]], the fourth largest [[Urban areas of New Zealand|urban area]] in New Zealand. The location was once considered as a potential capital of New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourism.net.nz/new-zealand/about-new-zealand/regions/waikato/history.html Ngaruawahia - a small town with a big history]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name origin==
[[File:Ngaruawahia Newcastle Butchery building.JPG|thumb|One of the few surviving examples of Ngaruawahia's previous name is the old Newcastle Butchery building, c.1921.]]

The name ''Ngāruawāhia'' means "the opened food pits", which derives from a great feast in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Te Ngaere, a Ngāti Tamainupō chief, and Heke-i-te-rangi, a [[Ngāti Maniapoto]] woman, had eloped and settled at Ngaruawahia, causing a rift between their tribes. When their first child was born, Ngāti Maniapoto were invited to the celebration in an attempt to reconcile the tribes. Te Ngaere's father named the boy Te Mana-o-te-rangi in honour of Ngāti Maniapoto. Peace was established between the tribes, and Te Ngaere shouted "''Wāhia ngā rua''" (break open the food pits).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Swarbrick, Nancy.

Until the Waikato invasion the rivers were the main transport routes, but, after the [[Great South Road, New Zealand|Great South Road]] and [[North Island Main Trunk|main trunk line]] were built, the rivers became barriers, which needed crossings.

As early as 1870 a public meeting called for a bridge,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DSC18701026.2.17|title=NEWCASTLE: PUBLIC MEETING.

===Tribal Huk===
A local gang is Tribal Huk, who have been seen as heroes by the community for providing lunches to schoolchildren in Ngaruawahia, [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and [[Huntly, New Zealand|Huntly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/opinion/85385414/tribal-huk-members-show-they-are-good-neighbours-in-ngaruawahia|title=Tribal Huk members show they are good neighbours in Ngaruawahia|date=October 2016|work=[[Waikato Times]]|publisher=[[stuff.co.nz]] |location= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they have been known for making sandwiches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/dateline/story/shades-bad-changing-face-nz-gang-culture|title=Shades of Bad?

In October 2016, Tribal Huk president Jamie Pink started a movement against [[methamphetamine]], known in New Zealand as "P".&lt;ref name="Holy Trinity"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/85859208/ngaruwahia-community-on-edge-after-gang-unrest|title=Ngaruawahia community on edge after gang unrest|author=Jo Lines-Mackenzie|work=[[Waikato Times]] |publisher=[[stuff.co.nz]]|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waikato District Mayor Allan Sanson supported Pink's message to Ngaruawahia methamphetamine dealers to either leave the town within 24 hours or "visits" would begin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/85302019/gang-boss-gives-p-dealers-ultimatum|title=Gang boss gives P dealers ultimatum|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
In the 1996 census, the majority of residents identified as [[Christian]]. A [[Bible]] is traditionally used during the crowning of a Māori monarch.&lt;ref name="New King" /&gt; In 1995, the Holy Trinity Anglican Church burned down, and a new church had been built in its place by 1998.&lt;ref name="Brief History" /&gt;

On the northern side of the Waipa River is the Christian Youth Camps (CYC), the largest youth camp site in New Zealand.  CYC started in the early 1960s with large Easter conventions.  Today there are two separate camp sites on 38 hectares of land. The camp offers school holiday camps throughout the year.  During the terms, the camps are used by various groups, including schools, churches and sporting organisations.

===Sport and recreation===

====Football (soccer)====
[[Ngaruawahia United]], known as "The Green Machine", is the local [[association football|football (soccer)]] club, founded in 1968. Centennial Park serves as the home ground for the club, and has been the home venue for [[ASB Premiership]] side [[Waikato FC]] in past seasons.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

====Rugby league====
[[File:Pioneer gun turret.jpg|270px|thumb|right|A gun turret of the paddle-steamer gunboat ''[[Pioneer (paddle-steamer)|Pioneer]]'', now mounted near the Waikato River.]]
The town's rugby league teams are Ngaruawahia Panthers and Tūrangawaewae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/7316219/People-matter-most-in-lovely-Ngaruawahia|title =People matter most in lovely Ngaruawahia|date = 20 July 2012|website = stuff.co.nz |publisher = ''[[Waikato Times]]'' |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Ngaruawahia Rugby League Club is the oldest such club in the Waikato. Early games were played on varying venues, for instance [[Taupiri|Taupiri paddock]] and Paterson Park. The first major match for the town was held in August 1911 when they lost to [[Auckland]] 22 - 36 at the Caledonian Ground in [[Frankton, Waikato|Frankton]]. Ngaruawahia did however beat Hamilton United 27 - 4 in the first ever Northern Union game to be played at Hamilton's Steele Park in 1912. The senior team were Champion of Champions in 1956 and 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Cb-ZtwAACAAJ&amp;dq=ngaruawahia+rugby+league+1911-2011&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zi0YUefPO43wmAXou4HoCA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA Ngaruawahia Rugby League: 1911-2011, 100 Years Ngaruawahia Rugby League Football Club, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ngaruawahia is the home of the [[rugby league]] team Turangawaewae RLC, which is named after the marae opposite the clubrooms. The club currently holds the record for the first team to win consecutive titles in the annual Waicoa Bay Premiers Competition, consisting of all teams in the Waikato, Coast and Bay Of Plenty regions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}
Ngaruawahia Rugby League Club (Panthers) are 2011 champions, Premiers, U17, U14, U13 are all champions.

==== River activities ====
The local [[regatta]] has been a fundamental event for the region for well over a century. An event is held every year in March on the [[Waikato River]].&lt;ref name="WaikatoRiver" /&gt; The first regatta was an unofficial event in 1892, involving both Māori and [[Pākehā]] festivities. The regatta provided a means of association between two ethnic groups, socially and culturally. The first official regatta took place in 1896 and since then has grown to become one of New Zealand's largest aquatic festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngaruawahia.com/about-ngaruawahia/history/the-regatta/ The Regatta]&lt;/ref&gt; During the centennial regatta in March 1996, over 48,000 people visited the town to see thousands of performers from a number of countries.&lt;ref name="Brief History" /&gt;

For many years, jumping off the rail bridge has been a tradition. However, groups such as [[KiwiRail]] want the practice to end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/86034752/ending-the-bridge-jumping-tradition|title=Ending the bridge jumping tradition in Ngaruawahia|author=Kelsey Wilkie |publisher=[[stuff.co.nz]]|date=November 4, 2016}} Retrieved November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

*  Their Nutrition and Health Kiddie Class (NHKC) program which aims to educate children, aged four to six, about the importance of food and nutrition. 
They have also implemented the Urban Family Development Program in 1991 to improve the nutritional status of depressed urban families through livelihood assistance and [[health]] and nutrition classes and services.

===Nutrition and Health Kiddie Class (NHKC)===
[[File:Nutrition and Health Kiddie Class.jpg|thumb|NHKC at Daan Tubo, Loyola Heights, Quezon City]]

A unique feature of the NHKC is the participation of the [[Volunteering|volunteer]] [[teacher]]s who handle all the classes without any compensation. Usually, they are mothers or youth from the community/ [[barangay]] who are trained to teach the [[preschool]] aged 4–6 years. They are called “MOTHER COORDINATORS (MCs) or NUTRITION YOUTH COORDINATORS (NYCs)”, respectively. The NHKC follows the school calendar, from June of the current year till March of succeeding year. Classes are held daily or 2-3 times a week, depending on the community. A session lasts for 2 hours.

The NHKC has a supplementary feeding component.  Primarily, the feeding aims to show the child and their mothers on how to feed them properly and to internalize the topics/subjects taught in the NHKC. Foods served are nutritious, easy -to -prepare and economical, which can also be prepared and served at home for the rest of the family members. The [[marketing]], preparation, and [[cooking]] are done by the mothers of the children for the supplementary feeding sessions.

===Family Development Program (FDP)===
[[File:NFP FDP.jpg|thumb|Family Development Program]]
This  is one of the major activities  of the Foundation that focus on the development of the family members to be responsible for the betterment of their health and ultimately improving the quality of their lives through: conscious recognition of each and everyone’s responsibility to themselves,  family and community; providing opportunities and support to augment  regular [[income]] through learning of some income generating activities, improved health and nutrition condition of their families through the implementation of some direct nutrition intervention activities; and developing skills in the implementation and management of community nutrition project and related activities.  Some of its components include the following:

====Values Formation====
NFP promotes activities that help individuals realize his value and potentials towards the development of the communities where he lived. It is the main goal of this program to make people realize a very important role he is to play for the success of their plans for the benefit of the community.

====Community Organization====
NFP helps organize the communities and facilitates [[group dynamics]], [[teambuilding]] activities and programs designed to promote [[camaraderie]], [[teamwork]], and cooperation among the people. Yearly program planning and evaluation focusing on problems encountered in the program implementation is also regularly conducted.

====Medical, Dental, and Nutrition Services====
In cooperation with the local health centers or district health units- medical, dental, and nutrition services are conducted. A team of [[Physician|doctor]]s, [[dentist]]s, [[nutritionist]]s, and barangay health worker goes around the [[purok]]s of the barangay, on a regular schedule, to render services such as [[deworming]], regular weighing, and dietary counseling.

Currently, the FDP is being undertaken in communities of Quezon City namely – Brgy. Santol, Brgy. Doña Imelda, Sitios Kaingin I, Kaingin II, and Proper of Brgy. Pansol and Sitios Chamberette, Mary Town, Park 7, and Daan-Tubo of Brgy. Loyola Heights; Tondo, Manila, and in the whole Municipality of Alaminos, Laguna.

===Dr. Juan Salcedo, Jr. Memorial Lecture===
[[File:Salcedo Lecture.jpg|thumb|2008 Dr. Juan Salcedo, Jr. Memorial Lecture with Mr. Mario Taguiwalo as the resoure speaker]] In the past years, the Foundation invited speakers who discussed topics on: “Collaboration and Institutional Development, The Politics of International Nutrition; Nutritional Repercussions of Developmental Transition; Perspectives and Challenges in Nutrition in the Philippines; Cancer and You; Management of Nutrition Programs by Local Executives; Infant and Young Child Nutrition; Coconut Oil and Cardio-Vascular Diseases, and   Strategies in the Prevention and Management of Hidden Hungers”.

===Nutrition Networking===
Another way of ensuring effectiveness in the use of scarce resources is by networking and coordinating with the different agencies that aim and work with a common objective.  This program is done mainly through cooperative services with GOs and NGOs in the country as well as international agencies/organizations; membership in working committees/[[advocacy]] groups;  provision of resource persons/speakers;  and consultation services.

For a number of years, NFP has been the Philippines Adhering Body of the [[International Union of Nutritional Sciences]] (IUNS). It is also a Founding Member of the Southeast Asia Public Health Nutrition Network (SEA-PHN). Likewise, it has maintained linkages with other international agencies such as the Federation of Asian Nutrition Societies (FANS), [[UNICEF]], [[International Food Policy Research Institute]], [[Helen Keller International]], and the [[World Health Organization]].

==The artwork==

The Passerelle de Bessengue is a wooden bridge with an iron handrail, painted in different colors, each one representing people of different ethnic groups holding hands. La Passerelle was designed by the Cameroonian artist [[Alioum Moussa]]. It was initially conceived as a cooperation development project funded by the Institut Régional de Coopération-Développement d’Alsace (Ircod-Alsace), the Municipality of Douala I, and doual’art. As project coordinator, [[doual’art]] ran a community-based approach involving the local Development Community of Bessengue-Akwa (CDBA) from the conceptualization phase to the project production. 

[[File:Alioum Moussa, La passerelle, photo by Sandrine Dole July 2012 01.JPG|thumb|left]]During the process, an artistic contest was organized in order to provide La Passerelle with aesthetical features. On five projects submitted, the selection fell on Alioum Moussa. His proposal aroused among the community a critical discussion and self-reflection about historical conflicts among autochthonous and non-native populations. The success of the project by Moussa was to create a link between art and community experiences, documenting shared intentions to promote and pursue a peaceful collaboration for future generations. La Passerelle was officially inaugurated during the [[c:Category:SUD Salon Urbain de Douala 2007|SUD 2007]] and restored two times. In 2009, Malika Ouedraogo and Cecile Demessine repainted the handrail. In the occasion of the [[c:Category:SUD Salon Urbain de Douala 2013|SUD 2013]], the Municipality of Douala funded the replacement of a handrail side and some broken wood planches.

La Passerelle has disclosed the block 1 of [[Bessengue]] to one of the busiest roads of Douala, facilitating the circulation of people, vehicles, and the provision of public services. Its position at the entrance of the neighborhood has contributed to create a square between La Passerelle and the first houses. This area, commonly known as Vallée Bessengue, has become an important landmark for children, young people and women who meet there to play, to date and to shop, surrounded by other art installations.

In [[film industry|film]] and [[television]], a '''production designer''' ('''PD''') is the person responsible for the overall visual look of the production. Production designers have a key creative role in the creation of motion pictures and television. Working directly with the [[film director|director]], [[cinematographer]], and [[film producer|producer]], they must select the settings and style to visually tell the story. The term ''production designer'' was coined by [[William Cameron Menzies]] while he was working on the film ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Cairns |first=David |year=2011 |title=The Dreams of a Creative Begetter |url=https://believermag.com/the-dreams-of-a-creative-begetter/ |magazine=The Believer |issue=79 |access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously (and often subsequently) the people with the same responsibilities were called ''[[art director]]s''.{{sfn|Preston|1994|p=150}} It is sometimes also described as ''[[scenic design]]'' or ''set design''.

== Societies and trade organizations ==
In the United States and British Columbia,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} production designers are represented by the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] local 800,{{sfn|Rizzo|2015|p=396}} the Art Directors Guild. The production design credit must be requested by the producer, prior to completion of photography, and submitted to the Art Directors Guild Board of Directors for the credit approval. 
In the rest of Canada, production designers are represented by the [[Director's Guild of Canada]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2629">The '''reproduction of Croatian currency''' is regulated by the [[Croatian National Bank]].

==Rules==
The Bank issued an act regarding this matter on February 28, 2002. The decisions most relevant to reproductions of Croatian banknotes are listed in Article 10, titled ''Reproduction'', which states the following:

:1. The [[Croatian National Bank]] owns the [[copyright]] on [[banknote]]s it publishes.
:2. The Croatian National Bank allows [[reproduction]] of banknotes it has published in the following cases:

::a) for [[photograph]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[picture]]s, [[film]]s, and generally any work for which the banknote itself or its reproduction does not hold central meaning and which does not contain a magnified version of the banknote's design;

::b) for the reproduction of banknotes specified in paragraph 1 of this article, whose length or width is increased to more than 125 percent [of its original size] or decreased to less than 75 percent [of its original size], regardless which medium is used for reproduction.

:3. The Croatian National Bank must [explicitly] approve any other way of reproduction.
:4. The approval for reproductions which meet the conditions described in paragraphs 1 and 2 may be withdrawn in case of violation of unalienable moral rights of the authors of the banknotes' design.

==Notes==
The title of the [[document]] is: "Decision regarding handling of banknotes and coins of kuna and lipa unsuitable for usage", but Article 10 seems to refer to all banknotes that the Croatian National Bank has published, not only kuna and lipa. There is no other document regarding reproduction of [[Croatia]]n [[currency]] and there is no specific mention of "unsuitability for usage" in this article. There is no separate document resolving the status of [[coins]] so it is to be assumed that the word "banknote" (in original: ''novčanice'') includes coins too.

'''Soft energy technologies''' may be seen as ''appropriate'' renewable technologies.&lt;ref name="The soft energy path"&gt;[http://www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid292.php The soft energy path] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222005324/http://www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid292.php |date=2007-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soft energy technologies are not simply renewable energy technologies, as there are many [[renewable energy]] technologies which are not regarded as "soft".

== Definition ==
More specifically, soft energy technologies have five defining characteristics.&lt;ref name=en&gt;Lovins, 1977, pp.38-39&lt;/ref&gt;  They rely on [[renewable energy]] resources, are diverse and designed for maximum effectiveness in particular circumstances, are flexible and relatively simple to understand, are matched to end-use needs in terms of scale, and are matched to end-use needs in terms of quality. An energy technology must satisfy all five of these criteria to be soft.&lt;ref name=en/&gt;

Residential [[solar energy]] technologies are prime examples of soft energy technologies and rapid deployment of simple, [[energy conservation|energy conserving]], [[residential solar]] energy technologies is fundamental to a soft energy strategy.  ''Active'' residential solar technologies use special devices to collect and convert the sun's rays to useful energy and are located near the users they supply.  '''''Passive''''' residential solar technologies ([[passive house]]) involve the natural transfer (by radiation, convection and conduction) of solar energy without the use of mechanical devices.

== Sociological definition ==
The term soft is not meant to be vague, speculative, or ephemeral, but rather sustainable, flexible, resilient, and benign.&lt;ref&gt;see Lovins, 1977, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;  Soft technology impacts are generally seen to be more "gentle, pleasant and manageable" than high technology impacts. These impacts range from the individual and household level to those affecting the very fabric of society at the national and international level.&lt;ref&gt;see Lovins, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, favourable socio-political impacts include:&lt;ref&gt;Morrison &amp; Lodwick, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;
* reduction in social conflicts and inequalities;
* reduction in population concentration;
* increase in employment, especially for the lower social classes;
* increase in the satisfaction of basic human needs;
* increase in consumer self-sufficiency; and
* increase in social participation and democratic processes.

The use of soft energy technologies, in conjunction with [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], and the transitional use of [[fossil fuel]] technology, comprise the [[soft energy path]].&lt;ref name="The soft energy path"/&gt;

'''''The House by the Cemetery''''' ({{lang-it|Quella villa accanto al cimitero}}) is a 1981 Italian [[horror film]] directed by [[Lucio Fulci]]. The film stars [[Catriona MacColl]], [[Paolo Malco]], [[Ania Pieroni]], [[Giovanni Frezza]], Silvia Collatina and [[Dagmar Lassander]]. Its plot revolves around a series of murders taking place in a New England home–a home which happens to be hiding a gruesome secret within its basement walls. 

== Plot ==
A woman (Daniela Doria) is in an abandoned house looking for her boyfriend. After she discovers his body stabbed with scissors, she is stabbed in the head with a French knife, and her body is dragged through a cellar door.

In [[New York City]], Bob (Giovanni Frezza) and his parents, Norman and Lucy Boyle (Paolo Malco and Catriona MacColl), are moving into the same house. Norman's ex-colleague, Dr. Peterson, who murdered his mistress before committing suicide, was the previous owner. The Boyles are to stay there, whilst Norman researches old houses. As his mother packs, Bob looks at a photograph of a house and notices a girl in it. In New Whitby, [[Boston]], Bob waits in his parents' car while they collect the house keys. The girl from the photograph appears across the street. The girl, Mae (Silvia Collatina), whom only Bob can see, warns him to stay away. In the real estate office, Mrs. Gittleson (Dagmar Lassander) is annoyed when her colleague hands the couple "the Freudstein" keys. She insists it is called "Oak Mansion", and promises to find the Boyles a babysitter.

Oak Mansion is in a poor state of repair. The cellar door is locked and nailed shut. A woman arrives and introduces herself as Ann, the babysitter (Ania Pieroni). That night, Norman hears noises and finds Ann unblocking the cellar door. The next day, Norman goes to the library to peruse Peterson's materials. The chief librarian, Mr. Wheatley (Carlo De Mejo), appears to recognize him. but Norman claims he is mistaken. The assistant librarian, Daniel Douglas (Giampaolo Saccarola), then informs Norman that Peterson conducted private research at the house. He studied records of area disappearances and other demographic data.

Mae shows Bob a tombstone on the grounds marked "Mary Freudstein" and says she is not really buried there. Indoors, Lucy finds the tombstone of "Jacob Tess Freudstein" while sweeping the hallway. When Norman returns, he reassures her that some older houses have indoor tombs because of the hard wintry ground. Norman opens the cellar door and walks down the stairs, only to be attacked by a bat, which won't let go until he stabs it repeatedly. Spooked, the family drives down to the real estate office and demands to be re-housed, but are told it will be a few more days before they can move. While the Boyles are at hospital to treat Norman's injuries from the bat, Mrs. Gittleson arrives at the house to tell them of a new property. Letting herself in, she stands over the Freudstein tombstone, which cracks apart, pinning her ankle. A figure emerges, stabs her in the neck with a fireplace poker, and drags her into the cellar.

The next morning, Lucy finds Ann cleaning a bloodstain on the kitchen floor. Ann eludes Lucy's questions about the stain. Over coffee, Norman tells Lucy that he's discovered that Freudstein was a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] surgeon who conducted illegal experiments. Norman must travel to New York to research Freudstein. On the way, Norman drops by the library and finds a cassette of Peterson's, which explains Freudstein killed his family. Ann goes to the cellar looking for Bob, but Freudstein decapitates her after slashing her throat. Bob sees Ann's head, and exits screaming. Lucy refuses to believe Bob's tale about Ann. That evening, Bob returns to the cellar looking for Ann but gets locked in. Lucy hears Bob's cries and tries to open the cellar door. When she cannot open it, Norman returns and attacks it with an hatchet. The rotting hands of Freudstein (Giovanni De Nava) appear and restrain Bob. Norman cuts the monster's hand off, and he staggers away, bleeding.

Norman and Lucy finally get into the cellar, which contains several mutilated bodies (including Ann, Mrs. Gittleson, and the couple from the beginning of the film), surgical equipment, and a [[slab (casting)|slab]]. Freudstein is a living corpse with rotting flesh. Norman tells Lucy that the 150-year-old Freudstein lives by using his victims' parts to regenerate blood cells. Norman attacks Freudstein, but the ghoul twists the hatchet away. He grabs a dagger off a tray and stabs Freudstein. Freudstein picks up Norman and rips his throat out. Lucy and Bob climb a ladder leading to the cracked tombstone. Lucy strains to shift the stone, but Freudstein grabs her and drags her down the stairs, killing her by ramming her head into the concrete floor. As Freudstein advances up the ladder, Bob strains to escape. As Freudstein grabs Bob's leg, he is suddenly yanked upwards by Mae. With Mae is her mother, Mary Freudstein (Teresa Rossi Passante), who tells them it's time to leave. Mrs. Freudstein leads Mae and Bob down the wintry grove into a netherworld of ghosts and sadness.

== Critical reception ==
{{expand section|date=September 2015}}
Film review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported an approval rating of 38%, based on {{nowrap|8 reviews}}, with a [[rating average]] of 4.7/10.&lt;ref name="rottomatoes"&gt;{{cite web |title=The House By The Cemetery (Quella villa accanto al cimitero) (1981) - Rotten Tomatoes |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_house_by_the_cemetery? |website=Rotten Tomatoes.com |publisher=Flixter |accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a contemporary review, Julian Petley (''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'') commented that the film had a "Frankenstein theme" but that "the film adds little to the well-worked legend" and that "this would matter less were the film visually richer, but for the most part it is comparatively sober and restrained, at least by Fulci standards"&lt;ref name="mfb"&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Quella villa accanto al cimitero (The House by the Cemetery)|last=Petley|first=Julian|magazine=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|volume=50|issue=588|year=1983|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petley continued that "the film undeniably has its moments–Bob's escape from the cellar; the human debris of Freudstein's laboratory; an attack by a particularly ferocious and tenacious bat; the climactic appearance of the horribly mutated Fruedstein"&lt;ref name="mfb" /&gt;

''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' called the film "a hack-work of almost awesome incoherence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Milne |editor-first=Tom |year=1991 |title=The Time Out Film Guide |edition=Second |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allmovie]] praised the film, complimenting its atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-house-by-the-cemetery-v23337/review |title=The House by the Cemetery (1981) |author=Craig Butler |work=[[Allmovie]] |accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom]] is the world's [[World Tourism Rankings|6th biggest tourist destination]], with 36.115&amp;nbsp;million visiting in 2015. US$22.072&amp;nbsp;billion was spent in the UK by foreign tourists. [[VisitBritain]] data shows that the USA remains the most valuable inbound market, with American visitors spending £2.1&amp;nbsp;billion in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/home/world-news/article/16044975|publisher=Sky News|title=Fears US Debt Crisis Will Hit UK Tourism|year=2011|accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the number of travellers originating from Europe is much larger than those travelling from North America: 21.5&amp;nbsp;million compared to 3.5&amp;nbsp;million American/Canadian visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=352|publisher=Office for National Statistics|title=Office for National Statistics – Overseas residents' visits to the UK|year=2010|accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's principal tourist destinations are in [[London]], e.g. the [[Tower of London]] is one of the most visited attractions in the country.&lt;ref name=ALVA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alva.org.uk/visitor_statistics/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120194452/http://www.alva.org.uk/visitor_statistics/|archivedate=2012-01-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domestic tourism ==
Domestic tourism remains the biggest component of tourist spending in the UK, with 2008 expenditures totalling £21,881&amp;nbsp;million, according to VisitBritain.&lt;ref name=VB2009&gt;''[http://www.visitbritain.org/Images/UK%20Tourist%202009_tcm139-191452.pdf UK Tourist 2009] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217185950/http://www.visitbritain.org/Images/UK%20Tourist%202009_tcm139-191452.pdf |date=2015-02-17 }}'', VisitBritain, June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The national statistical agency also estimates that there were 126&amp;nbsp;million trips made in 2009.&lt;ref name=VB2009 /&gt; The busiest period for domestic travel in the UK is during bank holidays and the summer months, with August being the busiest. There is a longstanding history in the UK of travel to coastal resorts such as [[Blackpool]], [[Lancashire]] and [[Swansea]], [[Wales]], with many families staying at accommodation called [[holiday camps]]. This tradition has faded significantly due to  competition from overseas [[package tour|package holiday]] operators, rising operational costs, and rapidly changing demand which forced many holiday camps to close in the 1980s and 1990s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1092">"'''Tribes With Flags'''" is part of a phrase attributed to [[Tahseen Bashir]], an [[Egypt]]ian diplomat (April 1925 - June 11, 2002). Regarding his belief in the centrality of Egypt within the [[Middle East]] he opined: "Egypt is the only nation-state in the [[Arab world]]; the rest are just tribes with flags".&lt;ref&gt;"Tahseen Bashir, Urbane Egyptian Diplomat, Dies at 77" , Neil MacFarquhar, ''The New York Times'' newspaper, June 14, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another version of Mr. Bashir’s ‘flag’ quip is: " 'When the chips are down, there is only one real place in the entire area – Egypt,' a [[Cairo]] diplomat once declared. 'All the rest – forgive me – are tribes with flags.' "&lt;ref&gt;''Baghdad Without A Map'' (Jan. 1992) by Tony Horwitz, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Two book title take-offs on this quote are ''Tribes With Flags: A Dangerous Passage Through the Chaos of the Middle East'' (Apr. 1990) and ''Tribes With Flags: A Journey Curtailed'' (1992), both by Charles Glass.

'''''You Are the One''''' ({{lang-es|Sos mi vida}}, [[Literal translation|lit.]]: "You Are My Life") is a 2006 Argentine [[romantic comedy]] television series, directed by Rodolfo Antúnez and Jorge Bechara and broadcast by [[El Trece (Argentina)|El Trece]] between January 16, 2006, and January 9, 2007. It is the second telenovela starring [[Facundo Arana]] and [[Natalia Oreiro]] as lead actors. The production included many location shootings, even during the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany, and many guest stars.

The plot follows the love story of Martín Quesada, an affluent businessman, and Esperanza Muñoz, a struggling female boxer who becomes his personal assistant. During its broadcast its overall rating averaged 26.9 points.&lt;ref name="Eterno"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/01/11/espectaculos/c-01101.htm|title= Sos mi vida: el fenómeno del amor eterno|trans-title= Sos mi vida: the phenomenon of eternal love|language= Spanish|author= Silvina Lamazares|date= January 11, 2007|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was critically acclaimed, and won four [[Martín Fierro Awards]] and three [[Clarín Awards]]. It was sold to more than 40 countries and had remakes in Mexico, Poland and Portugal.

==Premise==
The [[telenovela]] was produced by [[Pol-ka]] based on a premise by [[Adrián Suar]], which he formulated nearly six months before the show's premiere, after discussion with his partner Javier Blanco y Tevah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.castingportena.com.ar/notas/sec14ant.asp?id=184|title= Planeta Pol-Ka|trans-title= Planet Pol-Ka|language= Spanish|author= Natalia Trzenko|work= La Nación|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premise involves a rich businessman and former Formula 1 racing driver who falls in love with a poor woman looking for work in his emporium. Suar requested scripts from Ernesto Korovsky and Sebastian Parrotta, the authors of ''Gasoleros'' and ''El sodero de mi vida'', and ''[[Hombres de honor]]'' and ''[[Padre Coraje]]'' respectively. The program was directed by Daniel De Felippo and Rodolfo Antúnez and produced by César Markus González. Most of the filming was done in the Pol-ka studio at the [[Colegiales]] neighborhood, using outdoor scenes unconventional for the genre.&lt;ref name="Eterno"/&gt;

The telenovela features [[Facundo Arana]] and [[Natalia Oreiro]], who both appeared in the successful telenovela ''[[Muñeca Brava]]'', as lead actors. The relationship between the two was more than professional; Facundo Arana had spontaneously been offered a guest appearance on the Russian series ''A ritmo de tango'' starring Oreiro.&lt;ref name="Quimica"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/772619-una-pareja-con-quimica|title= Una pareja con química|trans-title= A couple with chemistry|language= Spanish|date= January 16, 2006|work= La Nación|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both actors agreed to appear in ''You Are the One'' on the condition that they worked together. As a result, the program design was decided only after both were confirmed in the leading roles.&lt;ref name="Quimica"/&gt; Oreiro delayed filming proposals in Israel, Spain, and Uruguay, and the recording of her fourth music album to join the project.&lt;ref name="Rionegro"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www1.rionegro.com.ar/arch200601/16/c16a01.php|title= Oreiro y Arana juntos en 'Sos mi vida'|trans-title= Oreiro and Arana together in "You Are The One"|language= Spanish|date= January 16, 2006|publisher= Río Negro Online|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in ''Muñeca Brava'', the narrative of ''You Are the One'' revolves around a wealthy suitor and a poor woman, but unlike the former program it does not concentrate all the characters on a single narrative context. ''You Are the One'' organizes two contexts for both the rich and the poor, each one with its own characteristic locations and supporting characters.&lt;ref name="Quimera"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/02/12/espectaculos/c-00811.htm|title= Quimera de amor entre dos mundos|trans-title= Impossible love between two worlds|language= Spanish|author= María Iribarren|date= February 12, 2006|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buenos Aires-La Boca-P2070003.JPG|thumb|left|Houses of [[La Boca]] neighbourhood, with their characteristic style. The tenement of the series was modeled after it.]]

Natalia Oreiro plays Esperanza Muñoz, a female boxer nicknamed "La Monita". Oreiro was inspired by the singer [[Gilda (singer)|Gilda]] to outline the character's personality.&lt;ref name="Gilda"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/838297-gilda-es-cultura|title= Gilda es cultura|trans-title= Gilda is culture|language= Spanish|author= Sebastián Ramos|date= September 7, 2006|work= La Nación|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main location is a tenement in the neighborhood of [[La Boca]] where Esperanza lives with other characters. Her adoptive mother Nieves lives with Enrique "Quique" Ferreti, her natural son and  Esperanza's childhood boyfriend. The writers drafted Quique's general outlines; Belloso defined most of his personality, including the relationship with Esperanza{{mdash}}which is halfway between engagement and brotherhood{{mdash}}and his [[Oedipus complex]] with his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www1.rionegro.com.ar/diario/2006/07/10/20067c10f08.php|title= Carlos Belloso con brillo propio en 'Sos mi vida'|trans-title= Carlos Belloso shines by himself in "You Are The One"|language= Spanish|author= Romina Grosso|date= July 10, 2006|publisher= Río Negro Online|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Esperanza trains as a boxer in a neighbourhood gymnasium with Quique, who has a wrestling [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] as "Commander Ray". Other main characters in the series are actress Nilda Yadhur, known as "The Turk", and Paraguayan janitor Kimberly.&lt;ref name="Quimera"/&gt;

The character of Martín Quesada establishes a context of wealthy characters. Quesada is a businessman and Formula 1 driver, but is not presented as selfish or greedy as is the archetype of entrepreneurs in soap operas. The two locations associated with him are the Quesada Group office, presided over by him, and his home. The office has the characters of Quesada's chief adviser Alfredo Uribe, the secretary Mercedes, and his cousin Miguel Quesada, who serves as vice-president, and the lawyer Felix Perez Garmendia. His girlfriend Constanza Insua and his cousin Debbie are also included. Martín lives with his housekeeper Rosa, Rosa's grandson Tony, and three adopted orphan siblings, José, Laura, and Coqui. Another recurring site is the apartment of Miguel and Debbie, which would be also used as the house of Constanza or Garmendia if needed.&lt;ref name="Quimera"/&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Sosmivida2.jpg|thumb|Supporting characters of the telenovela. From left to right: Alfredo Uribe ([[Alejandro Awada]]), Mercedes ([[Claudia Fontán]]), Enrique "Quique" Ferreti ([[Carlos Belloso]]), Constanza Inzúa ([[Carla Peterson (actress)|Carla Peterson]]) and Miguel Quesada (Marcelo Mazzarello)]]

The story begins during a boxing match of Esperanza Muñoz{{mdash}}nicknamed "Monita"{{mdash}}who has sustained a hand injury. Her manager, Enrique "Quique" Ferreti, is pressuring her to continue fighting, despite her pain. This injury complicates her economic situation, as her boxing provides the only income for her adoptive family, namely Quique and his mother, Maria de las Nieves. Nieves loves Esperanza like her own daughter, and pressures her to marry Quique. Her neighbor Kimberly suggests that Esperanza apply for a job in the Quesada Group, where she works as a janitress. The secretary Mercedes rejects Esperanza due to her violent manners and her dressing style. Martín Quesada, the president of the company, sees Esperanza crying in the street and hires her as his personal assistant.

Martín also meets three orphan siblings, José, Laura, and Coqui, who resisted being adopted by different families. He takes them to his home, and starts the legal proceedings to adopt them. Martín begins to like Esperanza, but his girlfriend Constanza, a cold, manipulative, and malicious woman, is wary of her. Esperanza does not tell Martín about her relations with Quique, instead pretending to be his sister. She also does not tell Martín that she is a boxer. Quique and Constanza begin their own relationship, unknown by most other characters. Martín breaks off his relationship with Esperanza when he sees her goodbye kiss with Quique, as he realizes that she was lying to him.

After the breakup with Esperanza, Martín resumes his romance with Constanza and eventually proposes marriage to her, in order to improve his chances of winning custody of the three siblings. The judge, who thought that Esperanza was a bad influence on the children, gives the adoption to Constanza instead of Martín, forcing him to marry her. Their marriage proves difficult; Constanza is demanding and possessive, and despises the adopted siblings, who hate her as well. Martín finally breaks with Constanza when she pretends to be blind to keep him with her. The children's custody battle delays the divorce, as Martín wants to keep them.

Due to the efforts of Martín's cousin Miguel, the unscrupulous lawyer "Falucho", and Constanza, Martin gradually loses his fortune, his business, and his house. He moves to the Conventillo and works as a taxi driver. Eventually, he recovers everything. A new character, Bárbara, temporarily joins the love triangle of Martín, Esperanza, and Constanza. Constanza gets pregnant by Quique and tries to pass off her son as Martín's, but fails. Martín finally marries Esperanza and has a family with her and the adopted children. Constanza moves in with Quique.

==Production==
[[File:080110 schalke arena germany.JPG|thumb|The [[Veltins-Arena]] stadium. An episode featured [[location shooting]] during the Argentina-Serbia and Montenegro match of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].]]

The program was directed by Daniel De Felippo and Rodolfo Antúnez, and produced by César Markus González. Most of the filming occurred at the headquarters of Pol-ka in the Colegiales neighborhood. The telenovela took several risks in the creative and production fields, which were mostly successful.&lt;ref name="Eterno"/&gt; The choice of Martín Quesada's background as a Formula 1 driver required an area with a large infrastructure to represent realistic races. For realism, plot scenes set outside Buenos Aires were actually filmed outside the city. There was significant press coverage during the location shooting in Germany, which took place during the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro played their characters in the [[Veltins-Arena]] stadium during the Argentina-Serbia and Montenegro match. The result of the match{{mdash}}a 6–0 Argentine victory{{mdash}}benefited the filming, and the episode received 31.5 rating points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/06/22/espectaculos/c-00201.htm|title= Yo te sigo a todas partes |trans-title= I follow you everywhere|language= Spanish|author= Silvina Lamazares |date= June 22, 2006|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Location shooting also occurred in the tourist ski resort [[Las Leñas]] in the [[Andes]]. A simulated aircraft crash that left the characters in a jungle was filmed at the [[Pereyra Iraola park]] and an [[Argentine Air Force]] park in Morón.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.diariolarepublica.com.ar/notix/noticia.php?i=116053&amp;f=2006-12-20|title= Martín y la Monita perdidos en la selva |trans-title= Martín and Monita lost in the jungle|language= Spanish|date= December 20, 2006|publisher= La República|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To make her performances as a female boxer look realistic, Oreiro trained regularly with the renowned boxer [[Marcela Acuña]] and her coach Ramón Chaparro.&lt;ref name="Rionegro"/&gt; They taught Oreiro how to stand and move in the ring and how to make various types of strokes, and she underwent cardiovascular and weight training. Acuña commented that Oreiro mastered the basic techniques more quickly than most beginner boxers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.latigresa.com.ar/prensa/15.asp|title= Muñecas bravas|trans-title= Brave dolls|language= Spanish|author= Marcela Acuña|publisher= Tigresa Acuña press|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this training, Oreiro temporarily gave up her [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.diariodecuyo.com.ar/home/new_noticia.php?noticia_id=137315|title= Las primeras ficciones del verano|trans-title= The first fictions of the summer|language= Spanish|author= Soledad Villarroya|date= January 16, 2006|publisher= Dario de Cuyo|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another plot required the characters to fly a [[Piper Tomahawk]] airplane and make an emergency landing. This was risky filming, and Arana and Oreiro did not use stunt doubles for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.infobae.com/notas/nota.php?Idx=253328&amp;idxSeccion=0|title= Arana y Oreiro arriesgan sus vidas|trans-title= Arana and Oreiro risk their lives|language= Spanish|date= May 5, 2006|publisher= Infobae|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene, which was the first of its kind in a daily Argentine telenovela, required four professional pilots, five special effects experts, and two additional aircraft used for filming the main aircraft from the outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/05/13/espectaculos/c-00601.htm|title= Un amor con mucho vuelo|trans-title= A love that flies high|language= Spanish|date= May 13, 2006|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arana was advised by the pilot Alberto Di Giorgio.&lt;ref name="Rionegro"/&gt;

The program's opening theme is [[Gilda (singer)|Gilda]]'s "Corazón Valiente" ({{lang-es|Braveheart}}), sung by Oreiro. It was produced by Toti Gimenez, widower and producer of the late Gilda. Oreiro is a fan of Gilda and chose this song as a homage to mark the 10th anniversary of her death.&lt;ref name="Rionegro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.infobae.com/notas/nota.php?Idx=232324&amp;IdxSeccion=100743|title= Natalia Oreiro homenajeará a Gilda|trans-title= Natalia Oreiro will homage Gilda|language= Spanish|date= January 15, 2006|publisher= Infobae|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She considered including it in her next music CD, but did not record anything afterwards.&lt;ref name="Gilda"/&gt;

===Guest actors===
[[File:Marcela Acuña.jpg|thumb|The boxer [[Marcela Acuña]] trained Natalia Oreiro and appeared as a guest star in the show.]]

The program featured several guest stars, who appeared in secondary or support roles in several episodes. Some guest stars{{mdash}}such as the singers [[Chayanne]], [[Ricky Martin]] and [[Julieta Venegas]]{{mdash}}played themselves within the fiction of the program. Venegas' song "Tu Nombre" is used as a background song in romantic settings. Marcela Acuña appeared twice, playing herself in a match against Oreiro's character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://old.clarin.com/diario/2006/12/06/espectaculos/c-00403.htm|title= Una pelea entre fierecillas|trans-title= A fight among beasts|language= Spanish|date= December 6, 2006|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of actress [[Leticia Brédice]] was nominated for the "best cameo in fiction" category at the [[Martín Fierro Awards]]; the prize was given to Nora Cárpena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/904827-martin-fierro-montecristo-la-mas-nominada|title= Martín Fierro: Montecristo, la más nominada|trans-title= Martín Fierro: Montecristo, the most nominated|language= Spanish|date= April 30, 2007|work= La Nación|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actress [[Reina Reech]] delayed other projects to take part in the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://old.clarin.com/diario/2006/07/14/espectaculos/c-00401.htm|title= Eran pocos... y llegó la reina madre|trans-title= They were few... and the mother queen arrived|language= Spanish|author= Fernanda Longo|date= July 14, 2006|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narration===
The program expanded the usual conventions of the genre by using several types of [[metafiction]], referencing the actors themselves or the nature of the program.&lt;ref name="Eterno"/&gt; An example within the plot is ''Sos mi muqui'', a [[Story within a story|program within the program]] whose characters were based on the show's main characters. The actors' former characters are occasionally referenced in plots that place them in similar contexts than those of older fictions. Martín infiltrated a convent using a habit similar to the one Arana's character in ''[[Padre Coraje]]'' wore, and Esperanza wore clothes similar to those Oreiro's character in ''[[Muñeca Brava]]'' wore when they had to get into a slum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/03/18/espectaculos/c-00301.htm|title= Oreiro resucitó a Cholito |trans-title= Oreiro resurrected Cholito|language= Spanish|date= March 18, 2006|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many actors played minor characters as well as their main roles. Pablo Cedrón played a Paraguayan brother of his character Falucho; both characters were involved in a love triangle with Kimberly. Carlos Belloso was cast as Quique's lost sister, dressed as a woman. Natalia Oreiro, who speaks Russian fluently, took the role of a Russian princess. Facundo Arana played a criminal, a role unlike Martín.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/09/22/conexiones/t-01276371.htm|title= Tuvo un sospechoso cambio de actitud: el bueno de Facundo Arana se sacó la careta (era hora)|trans-title= Suspecting change of attitude: the good Facundo Arana dropped the mask (it was about time)|language= Spanish|author= Lorena Bassani|date= September 22, 2006|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those scenes did not use special effects; each character was filmed separately without the two characters sharing the screen. The hero of the telenovela marries the villain, contrary to the genre's usual convention in which such a wedding is interrupted or canceled at the last moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/07/19/conexiones/t-01236598.htm|title= ¿El mundo se volvió loco? Finalmente, Facundo Arana se casó con su novia|trans-title= Has the world gone mad?

==Reception==

===Ratings===
The program was first broadcast in January, a month of low television activity in Argentina because of the summer vacations. Nevertheless, it was highly successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1080460-la-television-del-verano|title= La televisión del verano|trans-title= Summer television|language= Spanish|author= Ricardo Marín |date= December 14, 2008|work= La Nación|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competitor channel [[Telefe]] aired the teen comedy ''[[Alma Pirata]]'', which was rescheduled because of its low ratings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/823692-los-programas-para-adolescentes-en-baja|title= Los programas para adolescentes, en baja|trans-title= Teen programs, in decline|language= Spanish|author= Carlos Sanzol|date= July 16, 2006|work= La Nación|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced it with the second season of ''[[Casados con Hijos (Argentina)|Casados con Hijos]]''. Both programs had similar ratings until the end of ''Casados con Hijos'' in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/832336-a-los-golpes-pero-con-rating|title= A los golpes, pero con rating|trans-title= Fighting, but with rating|language= Spanish|date= August 17, 2006|work= La Nación|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an average rating of 26.8 points, ''Sos mi vida'' ended as the most watched Argentine television fiction so far;&lt;ref name="amor"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/874230-el-fin-del-amor-mas-visto-de-la-tv|title= El fin del amor más visto de la TV|trans-title= The end of the most watched love in TV|language= Spanish|date= January 11, 2007|work= La Nación|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was displaced by the 2009, telenovela ''[[Valientes]]'', which received 27.3 rating points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://television.com.ar/diario-online/minuto-a-minuto/data/104571/valientes-la-tira-mas-vista-de-pol-ka/#.UEI9c6Ak35Y|title= Valientes, la tira más vista de Pol-Ka|trans-title= Valientes the most seen production of Pol-Ka|language= Spanish|publisher= Television.com.ar|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
[[File:Natalia Oreiro.jpg|thumb|left|[[Natalia Oreiro]] received the [[Martín Fierro Awards|Martín Fierro Award]] for her work.]]

The program was awarded the best TV comedy at the 2006 ceremony of the [[Martín Fierro Awards]], prevailing over ''Casados con hijos'' and ''[[¿Quién es el Jefe?]]''. Facundo Arana received the award for best lead actor in comedy, prevailing over Guillermo Francella, [[Humberto Tortonese]], and [[Nicolás Vázquez]]. Natalia Oreiro won the award for the best lead actress in comedy, prevailing over Florencia Peña, [[Nancy Duplaá]], [[Carmen Barbieri]], and [[Andrea Bonelli]]. [[Alejandro Awada]], [[Marcelo Mazzarello]], and [[Carlos Belloso]] received nominations for supporting comedy actor awards, which was won by Belloso. Similarly, three of five nominations for supporting comedy actress went to [[Carla Peterson (actress)|Carla Peterson]], [[Mónica Ayos]] and [[Claudia Fontán]], but the award went to [[Érika Rivas]] of ''Casados con hijos''. The program was unsuccessfully nominated for best theme song and best guest appearance for [[Leticia Brédice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.terra.com.ar/canales/tv/160/160798.html|title= Montecristo ganó el Martín Fierro de Oro|trans-title= Montecristo won the golden Martín Fierro award|language= Spanish|date= May 24, 2007|publisher= Terra|accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro were nominated again at the 2007 Martín Fierro Awards. These nominations proved controversial because the program only lasted for a week in 2007, and had no second season, and both actors took a recess from work after it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1026466-los-premios-martin-fierro-en-medio-de-la-controversia|title= Los premios Martín Fierro, en medio de la controversia|trans-title= The Martín Fierro awards, amid the controversy|language= Spanish|author= Natalia Trzenko|date= July 2, 2008|publisher= a Nación|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of them received an award for those nominations. Oreiro won the newly created award for the best dressed actress of the night, which is not part of the official awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1026961-lalola-arraso-en-los-martin-fierro-y-se-llevo-el-oro|title= Lalola arrasó en los Martín Fierro y se llevó el Oro|trans-title= Lalola prevailed in the Martín Fierro and took the Gold one|language= Spanish|author= Azul Cecinini|date= March 2, 2009|work= La Nación|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Clarín Awards]] ceremony in late 2006, the program was awarded for the best comedy, prevailing over ''[[Casados con Hijos (Argentina)|Casados con hijos]]'' and ''Alma Pirata''. [[Elías Viñoles]] won the award for best actor, Ornella Fazio was nominated for best female actor; the award was given to María Abadi of ''[[Montecristo (Argentine telenovela)|Montecristo]]''. Unlike the Martín Fierro, the Clarín awards do not distinguish between lead and supporting actors. Belloso was awarded as best comedy actor; Oreiro was nominated and the award was given to Érika Rivas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/12/19/espectaculos/c-01330664.htm|title= La fiesta que distinguió a lo mejor del espectáculo|trans-title= The party that awarded the best of the spectacle|language= Spanish|date= December 19, 2006|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
The ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'' newspaper attributes the success of the program to the actors' performances, the subplots, production initiatives, and the original treatment of stories.&lt;ref name="Eterno"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/02/12/espectaculos/c-00904.htm|title= Terceros en conflicto (o parejas que arden)|trans-title= Conflictive third ones (or couples that burn)|language= Spanish|date= February 12, 2006|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of the supporting cast was also praised, including Carla Peterson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/07/06/espectaculos/c-00811.htm|title= Las chicas malas me sientan bien|trans-title= Bad girls suit me fine|language= Spanish|author= Silvina Lamazares|date= July 6, 2006|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fabiana Garcia Lago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/782417-una-actriz-en-primer-plano|title= Una actriz en primer plano|trans-title= An actress in the main focus|language= Spanish|author= Natalia Trzenko|date= February 21, 2006|work= La Nación|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Marcelo Mazzarello.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/02/13/espectaculos/c-00401.htm|title= El hombre que halló su destino|trans-title= The man who found his fate|language= Spanish|author= María Ana Rago|date= February 13, 2006|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper ''[[La Nación]]'' praised the show's mix of sitcom humor and telenovela drama, and equated the dramatic episodes to the works of renowned telenovela authors [[Abel Santa Cruz]], [[Alberto Migré]], and Delia Fiallo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/838156-escenas-para-derretir-la-nieve|title= Escenas para derretir la nieve|trans-title= Scenes to melt the snow|language= Spanish|author= Natalia Trzenko|date= September 6, 2006|work= La Nación|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was criticized for the length of time{{mdash}}nearly three months{{mdash}}before the lead couple's first kiss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/04/05/conexiones/t-01171611.htm|title= Te beso en el capítulo 3.583: cuando crear expectativa es un recurso tan exitoso como repetido|trans-title= I will kiss you on the 3.583 episode: when building expectations is a resource as successful as repeated|language= Spanish|author= Lorena Bassani|date= April 5, 2006|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarín also criticized a badly-performed striptease act by Facundo Arana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/03/15/conexiones/t-01158996.htm |title= Facundo Arana hizo un striptease para Natalia Oreiro |trans-title= Facundo Arana made a strptease for Natalia Oreiro|language= Spanish|author= Leonardo Bachanian|date= March 15, 2006|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Carlos Belloso could not go with Arana and Oreiro to the filming at the World Cup, he was filmed in the [[Plaza San Martín (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Martín]], pretending that he was in Germany as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/06/20/conexiones/t-01219129.htm|title= Sos mi birra: Natalia Oreiro y Facundo Arana también viajaron al mundial|trans-title= You Are My Beer: Natalia Oreiro and Facundo Arana visited the World Cup too|language= Spanish|author= Leonardo Bachanian|date= June 20, 2006|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program's scheduled broadcast time was 21:00, but the channel often delayed its broadcast by up to 40 minutes. This led to conflicts with other channels and COMFER, the institution that regulates Argentine television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/871641-la-dictadura-de-los-horarios|title= La dictadura de los horarios|trans-title= The dictatorship of the hours|language= Spanish|author= Verónica Bonacchi|date= December 31, 2006|work= La Nación|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/846805-canal-13-en-medio-de-la-encrucijada-del-rating|title= Canal 13, en medio de la encrucijada del rating|trans-title= Channel 13, amid the labirinth of rating|language= Spanish|author= Natalia Trzenko|date= October 6, 2006|work= La Nación|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last episode lasted for half an hour and was followed by the premiere of the new telenovela ''[[Son de Fierro]]''; La Nación said that the final episode should have lasted a full hour.&lt;ref name="amor"/&gt;

==Airings and remakes==
The program was initially aired in Argentina in 2006 on [[El Trece (Argentina)|El Trece]] at [[prime time]]. Following the success of the initial run, El Trece and ''Volver'' reran the show. It is sold internationally by the [[Dori Media Group]] under the English name "You Are The One" to more than 40 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/03/21/espectaculos/c-01384313.htm|title= Natalia Oreiro, a Cannes por "Sos mi vida"|trans-title= Natalia Oreiro, to Cannes for "You Are the One"|language= Spanish|date= March 21, 2007|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the program was sold as well, and some countries remade the telenovela with local actors. The Mexican version, ''[[Un gancho al corazón]]'', starred [[Danna Garcia]], [[Sebastián Rulli]], [[Laisha Wilkins]], and [[Raul Araiza]]. The characters were renamed, but Garcia's character retained the sobriquet "La Monita". The Polish version, ''[[Prosto w serce]]'', starred [[Anna Mucha]], Filip Bobek, and [[Małgorzata Socha]]. The Portuguese version, ''[[Deixa-me amar]]'', starred [[Paulo Pires]] and Paula Lobo Antunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.zapping-tv.com/tvi-volta-a-emitir-deixa-me-amar/|title= TVI volta a emitir "Deixa-me Amar"|trans-title= TVI airs again "Deixa-me Amar"|language= Portuguese|date= May 9, 2012|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
