The '''Amphitheatre of Durrës''' ({{lang-sq|Amfiteatri i Durrësit}}; {{lang-la|Amphitheatrum Dyrrhachium}}) is an [[amphitheatre]] in the centre of the city of [[Durrës]], [[Albania]]. The construction began under the [[Roman emperor|emperor]] [[Trajan]]{{fact|date=August 2018}} in the 2nd century AD and destroyed twice by earthquakes in the 6th and 10th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dianna M.

The amphitheatre is included on the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Albania#Tentative list|tentative list]] of Albania for inscribing it as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. It was discovered in the late 1966 and has become a popular tourist attraction in the city as well as in the country. 

==History==
[[File:Durres amfi.basilica mosaic 2.JPG|left|170px|thumb|A paleochristian mosaic in the chapel.]]
The amphitheatre was built in the beginning of the 2nd century AD. 
The amphitheatre was used for performances until the 4th century AD.  The earthquake of 345/346 likely damaged the monument and closed the 'ludii gladiatorii'.
An early Christian chapel was constructed on the amphitheatre in the second half of the 4th century. The chapel was initially decorated with frescoes; in the 6th century, mosaics were added.&lt;ref name="kos"/&gt;  A medieval chapel was built in the 13th century, also decorated with frescoes.
The amphitheatre was covered over in the 16th century, after the Ottoman occupation, when the wall was built nearby.  Marin Barleti described the monument as 'well constructed'.

About one third of the site was discovered and excavated in the 1960s by Vangjel Toci; the rest was excavated in the 1980s by Lida Miraj. After excavation the amphitheater slowly deteriorated, as no conservation efforts were undertaken prior to the 2000s, and construction continued to take place around the site. In the 2004 the [[University of Parma]] started restoration work to save the monument.&lt;ref name="kos"/&gt;

==Site==
The amphitheatre has an elliptical shape with axes of {{convert|132.4|m|ft}} and  {{convert|113.2|m|ft}}. The arena is {{convert|61.4|m|ft}} by {{convert|42.2|m|ft}} and is {{convert|20|m|ft}} high. It is built on a slope of the hill, and inside the amphitheatre there are staircases and galleries at different levels. The chapel with mosaics is preserved.&lt;ref name="kos"/&gt;

The site currently functions as a museum.

== Dangers ==
The [[amphitheatre]] is surrounded on all sides by the city of Durrës, and a section of the arena itself has been built upon with modern housing.&lt;ref name="kos"/&gt; Thus, development pressures threaten the long-term preservation of the site. The municipality of [[Durrës]] is now planning to remove the houses.

The amphitheatre has serious structural deficiencies, and its mosaics and paintings are slowly decaying.&lt;ref name="kos"/&gt;

In 2013, the amphitheatre was shortlisted along with thirteen other sites by [[Europa Nostra]] as one of the most endangered cultural heritage sites in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europanostra.org/7-most-endangered/|title=14 European sites shortlisted for 'The 7 Most endangered programme'|publisher=Europa Nostra|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Annunciation - Jan van Eyck - 1434 - NG Wash DC.jpg|thumb|''The Annunciation'', [[Oil painting|Oil]] [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred from wood to canvas]], c. 1434. [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, DC]], 93 x 37 cm]]

'''''The Annunciation''''' is an oil painting by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] master [[Jan van Eyck]], from around 1434-1436.  The panel is housed in the [[National Gallery of Art]], in Washington D.C.  It was originally on [[panel painting|panel]] but has been [[transfer of panel paintings|transferred]] to canvas.  It is thought that it was the left (inner) wing of a [[triptych]]; there has been no sighting of the other wings since before 1817. The annunciation is a highly complex work, whose [[iconography]] is still debated by art historians.

The picture depicts the [[Annunciation]] by the [[Archangel Gabriel]] to the [[Virgin Mary]] that she will bear the son of God ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 1:26-38).  The inscription shows his words: &lt;small&gt;''AVE GRÃ. PLENA''&lt;/small&gt; or "Hail, full of grace...".&lt;ref&gt;Contracted from 28 "et ingressus angelus ad eam dixit  '''ave gratia plena''' Dominus tecum benedicta tu in mulieribus ..." - [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=49&amp;chapter=1&amp;version=4 Latin Vulgate];  28"And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women." [[Authorised Version]]. [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lucas%201%20;&amp;version=9; King James (Authorised) Version]&lt;/ref&gt;   She modestly draws back and responds, &lt;small&gt;''ECCE ANCILLA DÑI''&lt;/small&gt; or "Behold the [[handmaiden]] of the Lord".&lt;ref&gt;Contracted from 38"dixit autem Maria '''ecce ancilla Domini''' fiat mihi secundum verbum tuum et discessit ab illa angelus" Latin [[Vulgate]]; 38"And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her." King James/Authorised Version.&lt;/ref&gt;   The words appear upside down because they are directed to God and are therefore inscribed with a God's-eye view. The [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] descend to her on [[Seven rays|seven rays of light]] from the upper window to the left, with the dove symbolizing the [[Holy Spirit]] following the same path; "This is the moment God's plan for salvation is set in motion. Through Christ's human incarnation the old era of the Law is transformed into a new era of [[Divine Grace|Grace]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.46.html|title=Jan van Eyck, Netherlandish, c. 1390 - 1441, The Annunciation, c. 1434/1436|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Gallery of Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Temple==
The setting develops this theme.  Mary was believed in the Middle Ages to have been a very studious girl who was engaged by the [[Temple of Jerusalem]] with other selected maidens to spin new curtains for the [[Holy of Holies]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiller p.34 The source was the [[apocrypha]]l [[Protoevangelium of James]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The book she is reading here is too large to be a lady's [[Book of Hours]]; as in other paintings she is engaged in serious study in a part of the Temple (one medieval authority specified  that she was reading the Book of Isaiah when Gabriel arrived).&lt;ref&gt;Schiller pp.34-5, 41-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The van Eycks were almost the first to use this setting in panel painting, but it appears earlier in [[illuminated manuscript]]s, and in an altarpiece of 1397 from the same monastery for which this painting was probably ordered.&lt;ref&gt;Hand 1986, p.81, who does not mention the altarpiece of 1397 by [[Melchior Broederlam]] (from the Chartreuse de Champmol, now Dijon Museum) - Schiller p.49 &amp; (fig 111), also discussed in Purtle 1999,p.4, and in the Losh External link below (fig 4)[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:BroedelamAnnunciation.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture moves from older, round [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] forms above, to (slightly) pointed Gothic arches below, with the higher levels largely in darkness, and the floor level well-lit.&lt;ref&gt;Many recent writers have stressed that the architecture of the buildings is not as anomalous, and therefore symbolic, as it might appear, and as Panovsky thought it. See Harbison pp. 151-57, &amp; 212, also Purtle 1999, p.3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  The gloom of the [[Old Covenant]] is about to be succeeded by the light of the [[New Covenant]].  The flat timber roof is in poor repair, with planks out of place.&lt;ref&gt;Purtle, 1999, p 2 and notes&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of Romanesque architecture to identify Jewish rather than Christian settings is a regular feature of the paintings of van Eyck and his followers, and other paintings show both styles in the same building in a symbolic way.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, pp. 49-50. Purtle 1999, p. 4 and notes 9-14. Also see Gallery, and [http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/projects/PUB/assaph-art/assaph2/articles_assaph2/09Pinson.pdf ''The Iconography of the Temple in Northern Renaissance Art'' by Yona Pinson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326170616/http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/projects/PUB/assaph-art/assaph2/articles_assaph2/09Pinson.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[File:Jan van Eyck 081.jpg|thumb|left|Floor tiles: [[David]] slaying [[Goliath]] in front, [[Samson]] pulling down the [[Philistine]]s' Temple behind]]

The decoration of the Temple is naturally all derived from the [[Old Testament]], but the subjects shown are those believed in the Middle Ages to prefigure the coming of Christ the [[Messiah]].  In the floor tiles [[David]]'s slaying of [[Goliath]] (centre front), foretells Christ's triumph over the devil.  Behind this, [[Samson]] pulls down the Temple of the [[Philistine]]s, prefiguring both the Crucifixion and the [[Last Judgement]], according to medieval authorities.  To the left, [[Delilah]] is cutting Samson's hair (Betrayal of Christ), and behind he slays the Philistines (Christ's triumph over sin).   The death of [[Absalom]] and possibly that of [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] are identified by some art historians, although only tiny sections are visible.  [[Erwin Panofsky]], who developed much of this analysis, proposed a scheme for the significance of the [[astrological symbol]]s in the round border tiles, and other versions have been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Hand pp. 80-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The rear wall has a single stained glass window, where Jehovah stands, above triple plain-glazed windows below, which perhaps suggest the Christian trinity.  On either side of the single window are dim wall-paintings of the ''Finding of Moses'' by [[Pharaoh]]'s daughter (left, pre-figuring the Annunciation itself), and Moses receiving the [[Ten Commandments]] (right, paralleling the [[New Covenant]] Christ would bring).  Below them are roundels with [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]], for which various symbolic functions have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.80, Purtle, 1999, pp 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;  The lilies are a traditional attribute of Mary, standing for purity.  The empty stool may be an "[[hetoimasia|empty throne]]", a symbol for Christ going back to early [[Byzantine art]].&lt;ref&gt;Hand pp 79 &amp; 81&lt;/ref&gt;

==The figures==
[[File:Annunciation - Virgin and Angel - Jan van Eyck - 1434 - NG Wash DC.jpg|thumb|right|330px|Detail - Mary and Gabriel]]

It has been suggested that Mary has been given the features of [[Infanta Isabel, Duchess of Burgundy|Isabella of Portugal]], wife of [[Philip the Good]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], who may well have commissioned the painting from van Eyck, his (part-time) court painter.&lt;ref&gt;Hand 1986, p.82. Carra Ferguson O'Meara (1981) originated the suggestion&lt;/ref&gt;  Mary wears a robe in her usual blue, which is trimmed in [[ermine]], reserved for royalty, which would suit this theory, although the Middle Ages placed great emphasis on Mary's [[Davidic line|royal descent]] in any case.  As is usual, especially in the North, Mary's features are less attractive than those of Gabriel; being a sexless angel there was considered to be no possibility of his beauty causing inappropriate thoughts in the onlooker.  Neither figure has a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]]; these were being dispensed with in Early Netherlandish art in the interests of realism - eventually the Italians would follow.  Mary's posture is ambiguous; it is not clear if she is standing, kneeling or sitting.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size===
Many writers, including Hand, call the figures over-large compared to the architecture.  This is certainly a feature of some of van Eyck's depictions of Mary in a Church setting, with a particular theological meaning.  In ''[[Madonna in the Church]]'' in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]] where this theme is most developed: the figure of Mary is some sixty feet high, filling much of the height of a tall Gothic church.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, 1991, pp. 169-187&lt;/ref&gt; It is not so clear that any effect of this type is intended here; there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building.  If, for example, the setting were a first floor room, or one giving on to a courtyard, the windows might be lower than is normal in a medieval church.  The size of the plain glass roundels does not seem disproportionate with the figures.

===Sacramental themes===
[[File:Louvre Le sacerdoce de la Vierge.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Le sacerdoce de la Vierge'' (The Priesthood of the Virgin), 1425-50, Louvre, unknown French artist]]
Another of van Eyck's themes, and that of other Early Netherlandish painters, is indicated by the large [[cope]] over a [[dalmatic]] worn by [[Gabriel]].  This would, in a human, mark him as a celebrant or attendant at a [[Solemn Mass|High Mass]].  Mary is facing a table with a book upon it about the right size to be a [[Gospel Book]] or [[Missal]], and has her hands raised in a gesture known as the ''expansis manibus''.  This is certainly to convey the alarm and uncertainty with which she usually greets the surprising apparition of Gabriel and his news, but is also a gesture used by a priest at certain points of a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.81 and notes&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting has been connected with the ''Golden Mass'' ("Missa Aurea"), a [[liturgical drama]], or dramatised Mass, popular in the Netherlands at the time, which included a staging of the Annunciation as the [[Gospel]] reading.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.81, and Lane, pp 47-50; both citing: Carol J Purtle, 1982. Also Purtle 1999 note 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobus, 1999, pp 1-4 describes the Golden Mass in the context of Giotto's Arena Chapel frescoes&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, this is part of a common theme in Early Netherlandish art where Mary, as intermediary between the faithful and God, is compared to, or seen as, a priest celebrating Mass.  Her personal sacrifice of her son  is compared to the ritual sacrifice enacted by the priest in the Mass.  In a surviving extreme example in the [[Louvre]] she is shown clearly wearing vestments and celebrating mass at an [[altar]]; more often, as here, the comparison is made more subtly.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, 1984, pp 41-77. The Louvre ''Le sacerdoce de la Vierge'' is fig 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other panels of the triptych==
No more has been heard of the rest of the triptych since the mentions below in the Provenance.  It would presumably have been an altarpiece, for a side-altar or small chapel.  The subjects of the other missing panels remain uncertain; a ''[[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]'' or ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'' are considered most likely for the central panel, at least twice as wide as this one, with a ''Visitation of Mary'' or ''Presentation of Jesus'' on the right-hand wing matching this one.  The outer sides of the wings would probably have been painted in some fashion, but if there was a full scene, or even a figure in [[grisaille]] on the back of this, it is unlikely it would have been discarded when the painting was transferred to canvas in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.81&lt;/ref&gt;  No doubt the themes of this wing would originally have related to those in the other wings in ways we cannot now guess.

==Painting technique==
[[File:Jan van Eyck 078.jpg|thumb|230px|The rear wall: Moses found in the bullrushes on the wall, [[stained glass]] of [[Jehovah]], with [[Seraphim]] above. The wall-painting is not in the underdrawing]]
A cleaning in 1998, and examination by modern technical methods such as infrared reflectograms, has revealed much about van Eyck's technique here, which is consistent with other works of his such as the [[Arnolfini Portrait]].  His [[underdrawing]] has been revealed, and so have many changes made in the course of painting the work.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Eyck's superb oil painting technique is evident throughout.  [[Gold leaf]] is only used for the seven rays coming in from the left; paint is used for all the gold on Gabriel, often worked [[wet-on-wet]] to achieve the textural effects of his [[brocade]]d clothes.  In a shadowy area behind the stool van Eyck worked a glaze with his fingers.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  The play of light over the many different textures in the painting is brilliantly rendered, and the illusionistic detail, especially in Gabriel's rich costume, is exceptional.

Apart from several small changes in the position of hands and faces, the under-drawing shows that the small pilasters on the left wall were originally planned to be repeated on the rear wall, and to be much taller, reaching nearly to the roof, on both.  The paint on the rear wall is thicker than on the left wall, so he may have painted the pilasters before changing his mind.  In the underdrawing the ceiling planks are all in place, and there was also a light source to the right, for which the shadows are drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford pp 2 &amp; 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrative scenes on the tiles replace a simpler decorative plan in the underdrawing, and the stool has become much larger. The vase of lilies was not only absent in the underdrawing, but was not reserved, that is to say that a space was not left for it in the paint for the Virgin's robe or the floor.  This suggests it was only added late in the course of painting.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford pp 4 &amp; 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Examination of other major van Eyck works reveals similar developments from the underdrawing, and in the course of painting, in these works.  It seems van Eyck, perhaps acting with clerical advisers, although he appears to have been a considerable reader himself, liked to add further complexity to his compositions in the course of work on them.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condition and date==
The painting was transferred from panel to canvas in the 19th century. It received a major cleaning in 1998, when varnish and some overpaint was removed, and a technical study undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, p1&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing before this, the NGA catalogue described the painting as extensively restored.  Craquelure (fine cracking to the surface) had been painted over, especially in the background.  Repainted areas included parts of Gabriel's face and hair, and the Virgin's robe, which appeared to have also lost a layer of glaze.&lt;ref&gt;Hand, p76&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of dates given for the painting was previously from 1428-29 (Panofsky and others) to 1436-37, but the discovery in 1959 of a date of 1437 on an altarpiece in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]], [[Dresden]] has considerably changed all van Eyck dating, and "makes it all but impossible to continue dating the ''Annunciation'' before 1432" (Hand).  The painting appears stylistically to come between the [[Ghent Altarpiece]] and late works such as the Berlin ''Virgin in a church''.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.82&lt;/ref&gt;

Two authorities have considered the painting to belong to Jan's brother [[Hubert van Eyck]], who died in 1426.  It is thought that the recent cleaning or technical investigation has tended to confirm the majority view that it is an autograph work by Jan.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.82, Gifford p.1 on the recent work on the painting&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Annunciation - Lily and the floor - Jan van Eyck - 1434 - NG Wash DC.jpg|Detail with the lily, the stool and the floor.|250px|thumb]]

==Provenance==
The [[provenance]] of the painting, as far as it is known, is:&lt;ref&gt;unless otherwise stated, Hand, 1986, p.76 &amp; notes&lt;/ref&gt;
*1791 - A visitor to the [[Chartreuse de Champmol]], a [[Carthusian]] monastery in [[Dijon]], now in France, but in the 15th century the capital of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], recorded seeing in the [[Prior]]'s room paintings, originally in the ducal chapel of the monastery: "... paintings on wood of the type of the earliest Flemish painters, which come from the chapels of the Dukes; they are about four feet high. The first, about a foot wide, is an Annunciation..."  The monastery was very largely destroyed in the French Revolution, but had been the burial place of the Dukes of Burgundy, and contained many important works.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Well of Moses'' by [[Claus Sluter]] remains ''in situ'', a Crucifixion by [[Jean Malouel]] of ca. 1398 is in the [[Louvre]]. The Broederlam altarpiece also came from the monastery.&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting mentioned is thought likely to be the Washington painting, although the measurements (in the French ''pied'', or ''foot'', of the period) do not match very exactly.   
*1817 - Bought at an auction sale in Paris by the major dealer C.J. Nieuwenhuys of Brussels, who sold it to [[William II, King of the Netherlands]]. In Brussels until 1841, then in The Hague. In a book of 1843 Nieuwenhuys says of the picture that it was "from a set with two others by the same master, painted for [[Philip the Good]] and destined to adorn a religious foundation in Dijon". A modern scholar has also claimed that the Virgin has the features of Philip's Duchess [[Isabella of Portugal]].   
*1850 - Lot 1 in an auction in The Hague, bought by Czar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] for the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].  Probably between 1864 and 1870 the Hermitage transferred it to canvas, as is often done with [[panel painting]]s when the wood develops problems. 
*1929 - Franz Matthiesen, a young German art dealer, was asked by the Soviet Government to compile a list of the hundred paintings in Russian collections which should never be sold under any circumstances. He was most surprised to be shown several of these paintings not long after in Paris by [[Calouste Gulbenkian]], who had traded them with the Russians for oil.  Gulbenkian wanted him to act as his agent on further purchases, but Matthiesen instead [[Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings|formed a consortium]] with [[Colnaghi]]'s of London and [[Knoedler]] &amp; Co of New York, which in 1930 and 1931 bought paintings and other works from the Russians, of which [[List of original Hermitage paintings in the National Gallery of Art|twenty-one paintings]] were bought by [[Andrew Mellon]], who had been offered first refusal. All are now in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, where they form some of the most important paintings in the collection (two works by Raphael, also including works by Botticelli, Titian, Veronese, Velázquez, Rembrandt).&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 1964, pp 24-6&lt;/ref&gt;    
*1930 - Bought by Andrew Mellon via the consortium described above. In 1931 it was deeded to the [[Mellon Trust]], which gifted it in 1937 to the National Gallery of Art, whose construction began in that year.&lt;ref name="NGA"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Annunciation - Provenance |url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.46.html#provenance |website=National Gallery of Art |accessdate=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trust fund"&gt;{{cite web |title=A.

'''Camilo José Vergara''' (born 1944 in [[Santiago, Chile]]) is a Chilean-born, [[New York City|New York]]-based writer, photographer and documentarian.

Vergara has been compared to [[Jacob Riis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gillette |first=Howard |title=Review Essay: The New American Ghetto by Camilo Jose Vergara |journal=American Studies International |date=October 1996 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=118–119 |jstor=23458456 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hedstrom |first=Matthew |title=Seeing Religion Happen in the Other America |journal=American Quarterly |date=March 2009 |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=163–171 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_quarterly/v061/61.1.hedstrom.pdf |accessdate=5 May 2014 |doi=10.1353/aq.0.0066}}&lt;/ref&gt;  for his photographic documentation of [[United States|American]] slums and decaying urban environments.  Beginning in the 1980s, Vergara applied the technique of [[rephotography]] to a series of American cities, photographing the same buildings and neighborhoods from the exact vantage point at regular intervals over many years to capture changes over time.  Trained as a sociologist with a specialty in urbanism, Vergara turned to his systematic documentation at a moment of [[urban decay]], and he chose locales where that stress seemed highest:  the housing projects of [[Chicago]]; the [[South Bronx]] of New York City; Camden, New Jersey; and [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], among others.

== Education ==
Vergara received a B.A. (1968) in [[sociology]] from the [[University of Notre Dame]] and an M.A. (1977) in sociology from [[Columbia University]], where he also completed the course work for his Ph.D. (not yet awarded).

== Career ==
Vergara began as a [[humanistic]] New York [[street photographer]] in the early '70s, when he moved to the city.&lt;ref&gt;some examples of the early street work can be found in a ''Slate'' series, "The Harlem That Was"&lt;/ref&gt; This work changed significantly in the middle 1970s, when graduate work in sociology at Columbia University increasingly sensitized him to the complexities of environmental influences on social behavior.
The advent of [[Kodachrome]] 64 film in 1974 alerted Vergara to the possibilities of permanent color photographic records of changing urban landscapes and their features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vergara |first=Camilo |title=Homage to Kodachrome 64: They just discontinued the film that changed my photography career. |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/gallery/2009/06/homage_to_kodachrome_64.html |work=Slate |publisher=Slate |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He began at that time to work systematically, using techniques adapted from sociological methodologies;  traveling from one subway stop to the next, he would emerge onto the street and then photograph the surrounding blocks, fanning steadily outward.
By 1977, he had come upon a rough approximation of his lifelong working method, returning to the same locales over time to photograph changes in the makeup of the communities in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Meyers |first=William |title=Camilo José Vergara: 2012 National Humanities Medalist |url=http://www.neh.gov/about/awards/national-humanities-medals/camilo-josé-vergara |work=National Endowment for the Humanities |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With more than a decade of photographs to document the extraordinary phenomenon of [[de-urbanization]] (including the conversion of buildings from one function to a second, then a third, before their abandonment, and the process by which nature recolonized long-urban areas), Vergara published ''The New American Ghetto'' with [[Rutgers University Press]], for which he received the Robert E. Park Award of the American Sociological Association in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Robert E. Park Book Awards |url=http://www.commurb.org/Park_Book_Award.htm |publisher=Community and Urban Sociology Section of the American Sociological Association |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demonstrates Vergara's use of time lapse in recording a site over time. Clockwise from top left 1979, 1988, 1997, 2004.]] The rephotographic method, with its rigorous demands for systematic return, exact replication of vantage point, angle of view, and lens choice, had emerged originally out of the need for scientific evidence of change over time in ecological niches.&lt;ref&gt;Peter B. Hales,"Landscape and Documentary: Questions of Rephotography," Afterimage, Summer, 1987, pp. 10–14&lt;/ref&gt; Vergara's use of the technique was not exclusive; indeed, Vergara made other pictures, including of residents and smaller details.  Beginning with ''The New American Ghetto'', Vergara increasingly interwove these photographs, along with quotes from outside writers, fragments of comments by citizen-dwellers in the cityscapes he developed, and his own writing. Vergara's work was the subject of a 1999 exhibit at the [[National Building Museum]], "El Nuevo Mundo: The Landscape of [[Latino]] [[Los Angeles]]." The exhibit was shown later in 1999 at the [[Cooper-Hewitt]], [[National Design Museum]], [[Smithsonian Institution]]. "The New American Ghetto," an earlier exhibition, opened at the [[National Building Museum]] and was later shown at The [[Municipal Arts Society]] in [[New York City]].  After the publication of his second major work, ''American Ruins'', Vergara's reputation was fully established; he won a [[MacArthur Foundation]] "genius grant" in 2002 and served as a fellow at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Center for the Humanities (MARCH) at [[Rutgers University]] in 2003–2004.

The advent of sophisticated internet combinations of mapping, visual archiving, and hyperlinking have enabled Vergara to present his work in ways that can combine both the vertical (change over time) and the horizontal (change across space) and link the visual images to texts and databases. Since 2004, Vergara's main work has been conveyed in a website called "[http://invinciblecities.camden.rutgers.edu/ Invincible Cities]." Upon the news that [[Google Earth]] would allow users to compare historical street scenes, [[Quartz (publication)]] likened the development to Vergara's website and oeuvre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lichfield |first=Gideon |title=The man who's been doing Google Street View since before Google's founders were born |url=http://qz.com/202111/camilo-vergara-doing-google-street-view-since-before-sergey-brin-and-larry-page-were-born/ |publisher=Quartz |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Camilo José Vergara on Lufthansa flight, May 2005.jpg|thumb|320px|Camilo José Vergara (self-portrait, airplane bathroom, 2005)]]
His projects include a continuing series of exhibitions, books, and magazine projects, including a collection of pictures of Chicago's public housing for the new literary magazine [[Granta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vergara |first=Camilo Jose |title=The Projects |journal=Granta |date=Fall 2009 |issue=108 |url=http://www.granta.com/Archive/108 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' and "[[Time (magazine)|Time]]" magazines have also commissioned him to produce "mines" of his work—collections that feature topics or themes, from GM automobiles&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/id/2208239/&lt;/ref&gt; to distant traces of the World Trade Towers.&lt;ref&gt;http://lightbox.time.com/2011/09/06/twin-towers-and-the-metropolis-1970-2011/&lt;/ref&gt; His eight and most recent book is ''Harlem:  The Unmaking of a Ghetto'', published in December 2013 by the University of Chicago Press. The book combines Vergara's early [[humanistic]] photographs with his long-running rephotography series of the iconic Manhattan community.

== Contribution to Discussion of Ruins and Photography ==

In 1995, Vergara made a controversial proposal that 12 square blocks of downtown [[Detroit]] be declared a "skyscraper ruins park," an "American [[acropolis]]," for the preservation and study of the deteriorating and empty skyscrapers:

{{quote|We could transform the nearly 100 troubled buildings into a grand national historic park of play and wonder, an urban [[Monument Valley]].... Midwestern prairie would be allowed to invade from the north.  Trees, vines, and wildflowers would grow on roofs and out of windows; goats and wild animals—squirrels, possum, bats, owls, ravens, snakes and insects—would live in the empty behemoths, adding their calls, hoots and screeches to the smell of rotten leaves and animal droppings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vergara |first=Camilo Jose |title=Downtown Detroit: "American acropolis" or vacant land -- what to do with the world's largest concentration of pre-depression skyscrapers |journal=Metropolis |date=April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The proposal launched a public conservation about representations of the city's built environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bennet |first=James |title=A Tribute To Ruin Irks Detroit |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/10/us/a-tribute-to-ruin-irks-detroit.html |accessdate=5 May 2014 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 10, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered an important statement in the debates surrounding [[deindustrialization]] and [[ruins photography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arens |first=Robert M. |title=Say Nice Things About Detroit: Private Visions and Public Debate |journal=Architecture Material and Imagined |date=1997 |issue=85th ACSA Annual Meeting Proceedings, Architecture: Material and Imagined |pages=634–638 |url=http://apps.acsa-arch.org/resources/proceedings/uploads/streamfile.aspx?path=ACSA.AM.85&amp;name=ACSA.AM.85.147.pdf |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://oa.upm.es/5978/1/FernandezAgueda_ponencia_2010_02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Leary |first=John Patrick |title=Detroitism |url=http://www.guernicamag.com/features/leary_1_15_11/ |work=Guernica |accessdate=5 May 2014 |date=January 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
In 2010, Vergara was rewarded a [[Berlin Prize]] fellowship and spent the academic spring semester 2010 at the [[American Academy in Berlin]].&lt;ref name="AmAcad10"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanacademy.de/home/person/camilo-jose-vergara |title=Berlin Prize Fellow, Class of Spring 2010 |publisher=American Academy in Berlin |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 10, 2013, Vergara received the [[National Humanities Medal]] from President Barack Obama in a ceremony at the White House.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/07/03/president-obama-award-2012-national-medal-arts-and-national-humanities-m President Obama to Award 2012 National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal] [[Whitehouse.gov]], retrieved 30 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday, May 18, 2018, Vergara was awarded an honorary degree from [[The New School]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newschool.edu/pressroom/pressreleases/2018/commencement2018.htm Glenn Ligon, Hilton ALS, Camilo José Vergara, Nancy Lublin, and Michael Gallert Named Honorary Degree Recipients by The New School [[newschool.edu]]] 2 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Child's Play''''' (also called '''''Chucky''''') is an American [[horror film|horror]] [[Media franchise|franchise]] centered on a series of seven films created by [[Don Mancini]]. The films mainly focus on [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] (voiced by [[Brad Dourif]]), a notorious [[serial killer]] known as the "Lakeshore Strangler" whose soul is transferred inside a Good Guy doll following a [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] ritual in order to avoid the afterlife and possibly avoid going to [[Hell]]. The original film, ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child’s Play]]'', was released on November{{nbsp}}9, 1988. The film has spawned six sequels and has gone into other media, such as comic books, a video game, tie-in merchandise, and an upcoming television show. The first, second, and fourth films were box office successes with all of the films earning over $182 million worldwide. Including revenues from sales of videos, DVDs, VOD and merchandise, the franchise has generated over $250 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/10/08/curse-of-chucky-25-years/2861753/|title=After 25 years, Chucky is both a blessing and a 'Curse'|author=Bryan Alexander|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 8, 2013|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also won a [[Saturn Award]] for Best Horror Franchise.

The film series originally started out as straight horror with the first installment ''Child’s Play'', which appears to have more [[psychological horror]] elements, while its successors are straightforward slasher films with elements of [[black comedy|dark humor]]. As the films progressed, they became [[satirical]] and [[campy]], until the series briefly became a [[horror comedy]], with 1998's ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'' and 2004's ''[[Seed of Chucky]]''. In 2012, it was confirmed that a new film would be made under the title ''[[Curse of Chucky]]'' and be released direct-to-video. Unlike ''Bride'' and ''Seed'', ''Curse of Chucky'' is a full-fledged horror film much like the original three installments. However, it does maintain the campy humor to a small degree. Since ''Bride of Chucky'', titles have no longer been released under the ''Child's Play'' brand name and now use ''Chucky'' and will continue to do so with future films.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/24/new-childs-play-sequel-curse-of-chucky-coming-to-dvd|title=New Child's Play sequel, Curse of Chucky, Coming to DVD|publisher=IGN|date=2012-06-23|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest installment to the series, titled ''[[Cult of Chucky]]'', was released on October{{nbsp}}3, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/01/05/cult-chucky-sequel-childs-play|author=Clark Collins|title=Cult of Chucky: Horror sequel plot details, teaser video revealed|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=January 5, 2017|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several short films have been made featuring the Chucky character: on the DVD release of ''Seed of Chucky'', a short film entitled ''Chucky's Vacation Slides'', set during the events of the film, was included, and a series of short films inserting Chucky into the events of other horror films entitled ''Chucky Invades'' was released in the run-up to the release of ''Curse of Chucky''. On television, Chucky has appeared in commercials and also on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', with a separate voice actor voicing the character. Chucky appeared in a pretaped segment during an October 1998 episode of [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s ''[[Monday Nitro]]'' program as a [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], taunting wrestler [[Rick Steiner]] who was a [[face (professional wrestling)|face]] at the time and promoting ''Bride of Chucky''.

Nica survives, but is institutionalized, and blamed for the murders. Chucky is collected by Tiffany, who delivers him to Alice. Chucky successfully transfers his soul into Alice's body which will be explained in Cult of Chucky, as he does the soul ritual the camera moves to reveal Alice's grandmother emerging from the basement, with a plastic bag around her head, slowly dying.

==Future==
====Potential sequels====
In October 2017, Don Mancini stated that he intends in having Glen and Glenda from ''[[Seed of Chucky]]'' return in a future film, and acknowledged that most references to that character had been cut from ''Cult of Chucky''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dailydead.com/interview-don-mancini-talks-cult-of-chucky-and-the-enduring-controversy-of-seed-of-chucky/|title=Interview: Don Mancini Talks CULT OF CHUCKY and the Enduring Controversy of SEED OF CHUCKY - Daily Dead|date=October 5, 2017|website=Dailydead.com|accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, it was announced that a ''Child's Play'' television series will be a continuation of the film's story arc. Mancini also stated that following the TV show, feature films will continue to be developed in the future.&lt;ref name="comingsoon.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/tv/news/921339-childs-play-tv-series-coming-from-don-mancini-david-kirschner/amp|title=Child's Play TV series coming - Coming Soon|date=February 9, 2018|website=Coming soon.net|accessdate=February 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' Mancini discussed the potential of a ''Child's Play'' film set on a train&lt;ref&gt;Referred to as ''Chucky on the Orient Express''.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as revealing plans for a crossover film with the [[Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise]], tentatively referred to as ''Child’s Play on Elm Street''.&lt;ref name=bloody-disgusting.com&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3319172/childs-play-train-freddy-vs-chucky-don-mancini-dreams/|author=Brad Miska|title=‘Child’s Play’ On a Train? Freddy Vs. Chucky? Don Mancini Dreams…|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=October 28, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would like to do Freddy and Chucky, just because I think they would be a fun double act," he explains. "I’m more really interested in the characters. My pitch for Freddy vs. Chucky is Child’s Play on Elm Street. Chucky ends up in some kid’s house on Elm Street, and Chucky and Freddy inevitably meet in the dreamscape. Chucky sleeps. Why not? Chucky sleeps, Chucky dreams. And they have this admiration for each other. But they realize quickly that Elm Street isn’t big enough for the two of them, so in a riff on Dirty Rotten Scoundrels they have a contest: who can kill the most teenagers before the sun comes up?&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In September 2017 in a separate interview with Cinema Blend, Mancini confirmed his intent to make the crossover film, describing it as "cool and doable", confirming that the film would be titled ''Child’s Play on Elm Street'' and that he was currently in discussion with [[New Line Cinema]] about the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1693069/child-plays-writer-has-the-best-idea-for-a-chucky-crossover-with-freddy-krueger|title=Child Play's Writer Has The Best Idea For A Chucky Crossover With Freddy Krueger|date=17 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation for a crossover film was previously laid in ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'', in which [[Freddy Krueger]]'s [[Freddy Krueger#Bladed Glove|bladed glove]] had appeared in the Lockport police evidence depository at the beginning of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/film/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-chucky|title=10 Things You Didn't Know About Chucky|first=Mark|last=Langshaw|date=26 October 2017|website=WhatCulture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mancini stated that besides the TV series, feature films will still continue to be developed.&lt;ref name="comingsoon.net"/&gt; By June of the same year, it was confirmed that Brad Dourif would return for the 8-part series to voice Charles Lee "Chucky" Ray.&lt;ref name="TVSeries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/tv/3505915/don-mancini-teases-childs-play-tv-series-coming-soon|title=Don Mancini Teases "Child’s Play: The TV Series," Coming Soon!|first=John|last=Squires|date=22 June 2018|website=Bloody Disgusting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky / Charles Lee Ray]]''' (played by [[Brad Dourif]])&lt;br&gt;The primary character in the fourth and fifth films and antagonist of the series. A merciless, wisecracking murderer whose soul gets stuck in a doll. He usually kills 'anyone' who gets in his way with a knife or any other weapon he finds and frames the hero of each film for them. Although being a deranged killer, he has a twisted sense of humor and often spouts comically vulgar insults. He is the only character to appear in all of the films in the franchise and appears in his human body in the first and, in the sixth movie, by flashbacks.
* '''[[Andy Barclay|Andrew William "Andy" Barclay]]''' (played by [[Alex Vincent (actor)|Alex Vincent]] and [[Justin Whalin]]) &lt;br&gt; The original protagonist. Pursued by Chucky so he could transfer his soul into the boy's body, but Andy always prevents Chucky from taking over his body, as well as successfully framing him for the murders. He appears in all three installments of the Child's Play trilogy and the sixth and seventh Chucky films. He is indirectly mentioned in ''Bride'' and ''Seed''.
*'''Karen Barclay''' (played by [[Catherine Hicks]])&lt;br&gt;Andy's mother, and later Mike's wife. She buys him a Good Guy doll for his birthday, unaware that the one she picked was possessed by a serial killer. Initially, she refuses to believe that Chucky was alive, but she soon finds out when he comes alive and tries to kill her. In ''Child's Play 2'', she is written out of the story when she was taken away to an insane asylum when no one believes her about the murderous doll. She appears only in the first film and is mentioned in the second, third and sixth films. In the sixth film, Karen talks to Andy over the phone, which reveals that she is now free from the asylum and plans to cook dinner for Andy's upcoming birthday. It is also strongly hinted that she has married Mike.
*'''Detective Mike Norris''' (played by [[Chris Sarandon]])&lt;br&gt;A detective investigating the murder of Andy's babysitter. He is also responsible for Chucky's death prompting him to transfer his soul into a Good Guy doll. He initially refuses to believe the Barclays, but when Chucky tries to kill him, he becomes an ally to the family. In ''Child’s Play 2'', however, it is mildly implied that both Mike and Jack denied the ordeal to protect the reputation of the Chicago police department. Appears only in the first film, and is indirectly mentioned in the second and fourth films. He appears via archive footage in ''Curse of Chucky'' (namely, pictures on the internet). He was originally set to appear in ''Seed of Chucky'' but didn’t return due to scheduling conflicts.
*'''Kyle''' (played by [[Christine Elise]]) &lt;br&gt; Andy's teenage foster sister whom he ends up staying with. At first, she finds Andy to be a pain on her side but starts to back up his story about Chucky when she witnesses him trying to take his soul and later finds their foster mother murdered by Chucky. She then goes to find Andy and ends up saving his life in the Play Pals factory, as well as helping him destroy Chucky after he tries to kill him after the voodoo soul transfer spell goes awry. She appears in the second film and was written out of the series and was never seen again but was briefly mentioned in the third film when Andy re-encounters Chucky again. She was also briefly mentioned to have kept in contact with Andy in ''Curse'' as he kept a photo of her. Kyle later returned in ''Cult'' in the post-credits scene where actress [[Christine Elise]] reprised her role.
*'''Mr. Sullivan''' (played by [[Peter Haskell]])&lt;br&gt;The greedy and arrogant CEO of Good Guy Toys Inc., First appears in ''Child's Play 2'' upon learning of Andy's Good Guy Doll supposedly becoming possessed by the soul of Charles Lee Ray, and tries to protect the company's reputation from angry stockholders. He also appears in ''Child’s Play 3'' when he moves Good Guy Toys forward with producing more dolls, however, he is killed by Chucky when he accesses Sullivan's office computer to find Andy in Military School. 
*'''Ronald Tyler''' (played by Jeremy Sylvers)&lt;br&gt;A young private boy who befriends Andy at the military school he is sent to after failing to cope with living at several foster homes. When he finds Chucky (who mailed himself to the same military school to go after Andy again), he decides to go after Tyler instead. At first, Tyler finds Chucky to be a nice guy but realizes the true colours of the doll's evil murderous ways once he attempts to transfer his soul into his body much like he attempted to do with Andy in the first two films. Appears in the third film, only to be written out of the series but was originally going to be killed off alongside Andy in the original draft to ''Seed of Chucky''.
*'''Kristen De Silva''' (played by [[Perrey Reeves]])&lt;br&gt;Andy's girlfriend at the military school he attends, ends up sticking up for him when Shelton and the other guys take a liking in bullying him. Appears only in the third film.
*'''Jack Santos''' (played by Tommy Swerdlow)&lt;br&gt;Mike's partner who was also investigating Andy's babysitter's death. In the beginning of the first film, he was mostly the cop who drove Mike's car to chase Eddie Caputo in his van. He was also one of the police officers that believed Andy was the killer. During the end, he tried to show Mike that Chucky wasn't alive, but was nearly killed by him and then he believed that the Barclays and Mike were telling the truth. He only appeared in the first film.
*'''[[Tiffany Valentine]]''' (played by [[Jennifer Tilly]])&lt;br&gt;Charles Lee Ray's former girlfriend (and later wife/partner) who later gets her soul stuck in a doll like Chucky. She ultimately transfers her soul into actress Jennifer Tilly (her doppelganger and portrayer) in ''Seed'' after being fed up with her husband's intent to remain a doll. In ''Curse'', she is shown to be living a double life as both her regular self and Tilly. Appears in ''Bride'', ''Seed'', ''Curse'' and ''Cult''. 
*'''[[Jennifer Tilly]]''' (played by herself)&lt;br&gt;An exaggerated version of Tilly, herself, and Tiffany's idol. She first appears in ''Bride'' under her role as Tiffany. Appears in ''Seed'' as herself and the voice of Tiffany. Tiffany was successful in transferring her soul into Tilly's body. Also appears in Curse and Cult.
*'''[[Glen]]''' (played by [[Billy Boyd (actor)|Billy Boyd]] and human form portrayed by Beans Balawi)&lt;br&gt;Chucky and Tiffany's original child and Glenda's twin brother. He was an orphan for the first five or six years of his life until he saw his parents on television. Glen is a good person, and he doesn't like violence and definitely does not like murder unlike his parents. Though Tiffany promised him that they will refrain from killing, Chucky tries to get Glen involved in the family business. He fears but still loves his dad due to the fact he killed him in a misunderstanding. He is the only living doll character not to be voiced by an [[Academy Award]] nominee. Appears in ''Bride'' (at the end as an infant) and ''Seed''. He does not appear in ''Curse'', nor is there any mention of him. 
*'''Glenda Ray''' (human form played by Kristina Hewitt)&lt;br&gt;Chucky and Tiffany's second child and the twin sister of Glen. She was originally Glen's alter ego for a brief moment, but was reborn as a human. Unlike Glen, she is violent, sadistic, and cruel. She is even more ruthless than her father, implying she possibly will take on the family business. Appears in ''Seed''.
*'''Jesse Miller''' (played by [[Nick Stabile]])&lt;br&gt;The former friend of Tiffany Ray and boyfriend of Jade. He was greatly disliked by Jade's uncle and believed to be responsible for his death until Chucky and Tiffany reveal themselves. In the end, Jade kills Chucky and she and Jesse leave the scene. He also appears in a ''Chucky'' comic continuation. Appears in ''Bride of Chucky'' and mentioned in ''Seed of Chucky''.
*'''Jade Kincaid''' (played by [[Katherine Heigl]])&lt;br&gt;The girlfriend of Jesse. Her uncle Warren is killed by Chucky and Tiffany early in the film. In the end, Jade shoots Chucky and she and Jesse leave the scene. She also appears with Jesse in another struggle with Chucky in a comic book continuation. Appears in ''Bride of Chucky'' and mentioned in ''Seed of Chucky''.

==Controversies==

The following crimes have been associated with the ''Child’s Play'' films:

In December 1992 four people who [[Murder of Suzanne Capper#Torture|tortured and killed]] 16-year-old  Suzanne Capper were said to be influenced by one of the ''Child's Play'' movies. During the torturing of the girl, the perpetrators taunted her by playing her a song, (''Hi, I'm Chucky (Wanna Play?)'' by 150 Volts, featuring [[Sampling (music)|samples]] from the movie ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]''.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sadistic Killers: Profiles of pathological predators|first=Carol Anne|last=Davis|year=2007|publisher=Summersdale Publishing|location=Chichester|isbn=978-1-84024-581-3|authorlink=Carol Anne Davis|pages=298–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, two youths who abducted and murdered a toddler named [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]] were said to have been influenced by the film ''[[Child's Play 3|Child’s Play 3]]''. The supposed link between the murder and the film was denied by film censor [[James Ferman]].&lt;ref name="bbc2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2605543.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Film censor Ferman dies|date=December 25, 2002|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a relative of two boys aged 10 and 12 who brutally attacked a nine-year-old and 11-year-old boy in Edlington, South Yorkshire in April 2009, the attackers watched horror movies, including ''Chucky'' films, from the age of about six or seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/south_yorkshire/8235661.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Boys' mother 'fed them cannabis'|date=September 3, 2009|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Cleaners (serial killers)|Elena Lobacheva]], a Russian serial killer arrested in 2015, was reportedly obsessed with the film ''Bride of Chucky'', which she cited as being an inspiration for the murders that she and her gang committed throughout [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-serial-killer-elena-lobacheva-bride-chucky-sexual-pleasure-killing-jailed-a8022326.html|title = ''Bride of Chucky'' serial killer who derived sexual pleasure from killing jailed|last = McIntyre|first = Niamh|publisher = ''[[The Independent]]''|date = 26 October 2017|website = independent.co.uk|accessdate = 28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comic books==

===Innovation Publishing===
Beginning in 1992, [[Innovation Publishing]] released the first comic books based on the films, in the form of a three-issue adaptation of ''Child’s Play 2''. It was later collected in a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]. The success of the adaptation led to a monthly series of new stories starting in 1991. The series, titled ''Child’s Play: The Series'', ended in 1992 after only five issues. This was followed by a three-issue adaptation of ''Child’s Play 3''.

===Devil's Due Publishing===
In 2007, [[Devil's Due Publishing]] obtained the license to publish ''Child's Play'' comics and released a one-shot crossover with [[Hack/Slash]] titled ''Hack/Slash vs. Chucky'' which takes place after the events of the ''Seed of Chucky'' film. This was followed by a four-issue series called ''Chucky''. A second volume began in early 2009 but ceased publication after only one issue.

==Video game==
{{main|Chucky: Slash &amp; Dash}}
Slimstown Studios announced an endless runner video game titled ''Chucky: Slash &amp; Dash''. The game is scheduled to be released on iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Android devices. It is the result of an agreement with Universal Partnerships &amp; Licensing to develop and publish the first officially licensed smartphone and tablet ''Child’s Play'' video game. The gameplay is actually inspired by the second film's climax.

In the game, Chucky is stuck in a never-ending nightmare in which he's endlessly running through the factory that produces Good Guys dolls. Players control Chucky while sprinting through the factory floor, the catwalks, the warehouse, or even outside, and need to avoid conveyor belts, forklifts, acid pools, barrels and other obstacles. Chucky can also eliminate security guards patrolling the factory using his classic knife or other more outlandish weapons like a cleaver, screwdriver, or hatchet. As they play, gamers collect batteries that can be used to purchase in-game items or power-ups, such as a double battery bonus, a fast start, or extra lives that can extend a run after dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Webb|first=Charles|title=''Child’s Play'' Killer Chucky The Unlikely Hero of Endless Runner ''Chucky: Slash &amp; Dash''|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2468019/childs-play-killer-chucky-the-unlikely-hero-of-endless-runner-chucky-slash-dash/|work=MTV|date=August 30, 2013|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The app was released on November 1, 2013.

==Halloween Horror Nights==
Since 1992, [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] has starred in his own shows at [[Universal Studios]] ''[[Halloween Horror Nights]]'', entitled, ''Chucky's In-Your-Face Insults'' and ''Chucky's Insult Emporium''.

In 2009, the climax of ''[[Child's Play 3|Child’s Play 3]]'' received its own maze, entitled ''Chucky's Fun House''. ''[[Curse of Chucky]]'' has also received its own scarezone in the 2013 lineup.

In 2017, Chucky played host to the Titans of Terror Tram which featured iconic horror villains [[Leatherface]], [[Freddy Krueger]], and [[Jason Voorhees]].

The '''conservation and restoration of wooden furniture''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of wooden furniture objects of historical and personal value. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].  Furniture conservation and restoration can be divided into two general areas: structure and finish. Structure generally relates to wood and can be divided into solid, joined, and veneered wood. The finish of furniture can be painted or transparent.&lt;ref&gt;Podmaniczky, Michael S. (2000) Furniture. In ''The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collections,'' (Pg. 125). London, University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Furniture]] has existed throughout all the years of human existence. Furniture that is very dated or is an [[antique]] can be conserved or restored so that future generations may also enjoy them for cultural, educational and personal benefit. There are many organizations and guidebooks that can be used to understand the techniques that are used to conserve and restore furniture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conservation-us.org/membership/find-a-conservator#.VTkUSiFViko "Guide to Finding a Conservator" American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.conservation-us.org/membership/find-a-conservator]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==

The conservation of furniture is the synthesis of three major endeavors, according to the [http://www.si.edu/mci/english/professional_development/past_courses_programs/programs/FCTP.html Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute]:
# The minimization of deterioration (preservation);
#The consolidation (stabilization) of artifacts as they currently exist;
#Repair/replacement (compensation or restoration) of existing damage.

[[File:American sideboard, late 18th century, Honolulu Museum of Art, 3407.1.JPG|thumb|American sideboard, late 18th century, Honolulu Museum of Art, 3407.1]]
Preventive conservation is the form of conservation recognized here with furniture care. [http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/public-relations/furniture.pdf?sfvrsn=2 The American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works] declares that stripping and refinishing furniture is no longer standard practice. An early finish is as important to historic furniture as are any of the other original elements. The finish coating offers important data to researchers and is part of the history of the object and once it is removed, it cannot be recovered.  The removal and replacement of a surface finish is considered a last ditch effort after other conservation methods have failed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/public-relations/furniture.pdf?sfvrsn=2 "Caring for Your Treasures" American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works. accessed 4/28/2015 [http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/public-relations/furniture.pdf?sfvrsn=2]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Institut national du patrimoine ===
In France, conservators specialized in furniture are trained at the [[Institut national du patrimoine|Institut National du Patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration. 

==Restoration==
[[Antiques restoration]] can be an arduous process if the goal is total and complete authenticity. For conservators, authentic material is the actual original material of the object. For example: A chair with its original [[upholstery]], even if it is faded and shredded, is authentic for the conservator and possesses historic value even though it may not be exhibitable. The same chair can be "restored" and looking as it did when new, with replacement fabric copied from the original weave and colors, and upholstered according to the known design of that particular piece of furniture; this would represent the other kind of authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, Barbara. (2010) ''Conservation Treatment Methodology'' (Pg. 97).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original material==
Furniture can be divided into periods dominated by the use of a particular wood.&lt;ref&gt;Capadose, Jeremy. (2011) Furniture. In ''The National Trust Manual of Housekeeping: Care and conservation of collections in historic houses'' (Pg. 363). Swindon, Wiltshire. National Trust Books.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Until the late 17th Century [[oak]] was dominant.
*From the mid-17th Century, [[walnut]] gradually became the main wood for the outside and drawer sides in the best quality pieces with oak still used for the underlying part.
*In the second quarter of the 18th Century the first [[mahogany]] was imported from the [[West Indies]] and eventually replaced walnut.
*By the 1790s, [[satinwood]] was popular as a decorative exotic timber for top quality pieces.
*During the [[Regency]] period [[rosewood]] was predominant.
*'''But since then no one species has dominated.'''

Furniture can consist of many different, and extra, components:&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, Barbara. (2010) ''Conservation Treatment Methodology,''(Pg. 257).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Original adhesives
*Upholstery fabric
*Webbing and stuffing
*Casters
*Labels
*Accretions and stains from original use and from later periods
*Old dust in crevices
*Repair hardware and adhesives
*Objects left in drawers or cupboards
*Whole replacement parts
*Carcase (The main structural elements making up the body of a piece of furniture)

== Upholstered furniture ==

Dusting upholstered furniture can be achieved by placing a soft screen on the surface and using a brush attachment on a [[HEPA]] vacuum with gentle suction.&lt;ref&gt;https://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/smithsonianmcifurniturecare.pdf Smithsonian ''Museum Conservation Institute,'' "Furniture Care and Handling" Page 12. accessed 4/23/2015 [https://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/smithsonianmcifurniturecare.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; For further cleaning of upholstered furniture, such as stains, this may most likely require a textile conservator, in addition to a conservator with knowledge of wooden furniture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winterthur.org/?p=457 "Furniture Conservation" Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library. accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.winterthur.org/?p=457]&lt;/ref&gt;

When a conservator-restorer is working on upholstered furniture it is important for them to consider innovative approaches to reversibility, the maximum preservation of information, and the use of chemically stable materials. Treatments can produce objects that ''appear'' indistinguishable from furniture upholstered in traditional ways, but the actual means of attachment does not include any nails or staples that pierce wood. [[Velcro]] makes it possible to examine the carcass of the furniture without undoing any part of the treatment. When furniture is treated using these techniques, stuffing is typically replaced by [[Ethafoam]] carved to the appropriate shape. The resulting object has a seat that looks like the original one, but is not "sittable."&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, Barbara. (2010) ''Conservation Treatment Methodology,'' (pg. 360–361).&lt;/ref&gt;

American furniture from the mid-nineteenth century probably received new upholstery about every thirty years. Sometimes new fabric was placed on top of the old, and at other times worn upholstery was entirely removed before the new covering was applied. Conservator-restorers can sometimes find threads of original fiber evidence on the chair frame, usually around tack holes. This can guide them to the creation of a reproduction of the original upholstery if an original fabric is not available.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Richard. (2009) ''Conservation: MFA Highlights.'' (pg. 50–53) United States: Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marie Antoinette's chair===
The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] has a '''case study''' on their [http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/conservation-blog/the-conservation-of-marie-antoinettes-chair website] on the description of the conservation treatment that was carried out on [[Marie Antoinette]]'s chair in preparation for its display in the new Europe galleries due to open later in 2015. The chair was made in 1788 by Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené (1748–1803). The chair has been re-upholstered several times, re-gilded and over-painted. The last intervention was in the 1970s when it was upholstered in blue swagged fabric and partially painted a greyish blue.

==Varnish==
A [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[varnish]], [[cellulose nitrate]], was developed in the 1850s but was not available in a formulation suitable for commercial furniture until the late 1920s. Unfortunately, cellulose nitrate discolors and becomes brittle as it ages, so over time, the coating on furniture can turn yellow and opaque. It can also crisscross in some places by a fine network of cracks or the varnish can fall off completely. The early date and rarity of this original coating makes it important to retain the varnish on furniture despite these problems.

In a '''case study''' of an armoire with this condition from the 1930s from [http://www.mfa.org/ The Museum of Fine Arts] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]:
"Conservators used a more stable synthetic [[resin]], a type of acrylic copolymer dissolved in a solvent, to consolidate weakened areas of the original varnish without significantly changing the glossiness of its finish or its color. To provide a consistent overall finish, they tinted a portion of that solution the same color as the aged cellulose nitrate to fill some of the more jarring losses. In the future, the new varnish will not be easy to remove, if it can be removed at all, but the synthetic resin used by the conservators is known to have good aging properties." &lt;ref&gt;Newman, Richard. (2009) ''Conservation: MFA Highlights.''(Pg. 76) United States: Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions==
[[File:Braunfaeule Holz FI20070208.jpg|thumb|Dry Rot]]
The following is a list of '''Wood Terms''' to describe conditions, as suggested by ''MRM5: Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition:''&lt;ref&gt;Demeroukas, Marie. Buck, edited by Rebecca A.; Gilmore, Jean Allman (2010). MRM5 : museum registration methods (5th ed. ed.). Washington, DC: AAM Press, American Association of Museums. (pgs. 229–230). {{ISBN|978-1-933253-15-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alligatoring:''' Series of hairline cracks in old varnish, creating the appearance of [[alligator]] hide.

'''Checking:''' Slight gapping between wood cells that creates a [[checkerboard]]-like pattern. Found where wood is cut straight across the grain for carving, such as in a ball-and-claw foot.

'''Dry rot:''' Decay of seasoned timber caused by fungi that consume the [[cellulose]] of wood, leaving a soft skeleton that is readily reduced to powder.

'''Shrinkage:''' A loss of mass or size in response to dry relative humidity conditions.

== Preventable damage ==
Preventive conservation is the best form of conservation that you can do for furniture without a scientific conservation degree.

===The impact of the environment===
A poorly controlled environment can cause detached veneer, cracks, and flaking paint.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winterthur.org/?p=457 "Preventive Conservation" Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library. accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.winterthur.org/?p=457]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Light====
Light easily causes color fading. Light is a major concern for furniture because the stains and color of wood are very susceptible to both natural and artificial light.&lt;ref&gt;Podmaniczky, Michael S. (2000) Furniture. In ''The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collections,'' (pg. 131). London, University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Temperature and relative humidity ====
To prevent cracks and veneer cleavage, avoid placing furniture near radiators, heat vents or other areas where temperature and [[relative humidity]] (RH) fluctuate widely. A stable relative humidity is particularly important to furniture since rapid changes cause different parts of the object to expand and contract at different rates and to different degrees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winterthur.org/?p=457 "Furniture and Wooden Objects" Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library. accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.winterthur.org/?p=295]&lt;/ref&gt; If the relative humidity is over 60% [[fungi]], such as molds and mildews, will become rampant on wooden furniture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.si.edu/mci/english/learn_more/taking_care/biodetwood.html  "Biological Deterioration &amp; Damage to Furniture &amp; Wooden Objects" Smithsonian ''Museum Conservation Institute'' accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.si.edu/mci/english/learn_more/taking_care/biodetwood.html]&lt;/ref&gt; '''The recommended range for wooden furniture is 45%–55% RH.'''&lt;ref&gt;Klim, Susan. (1992). Furniture Conservation. In ''Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators,''(Pg.106). Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Impacts of change in RH on wooden furniture:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/furniture-meubles/449-eng.aspx CCI-ICC, "How to Care for Wooden Furniture," 4/1/2002. accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/furniture-meubles/449-eng.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Low RH''
*Wood shrinks and splits
*Joints become loose and the elements no longer fir together tightly
*Veneers and inlays suffer – If the underlying carcase wood shrinks, cracks will appear in the veneer and inlays become loose
*When the glues holding them down fail, veneers lift
*Causes polishes to shrink, craze and flake

''High RH''
*Swelling can cause moving parts such as cabinet doors or drawers to jam
*If glue fails, veneer peels away
*[[Corrosion]] affects nails holding things in place, metal inlay and fillings
*Insects and rot may flourish as the content of the wood rises

Fast and constant cycling of RH fluctuations causes the most damage for all of the above to create rapid structural weakening.

====Pests====
[[File:Lyctoxylon dentatum.jpg|thumb|Powderpost Beetle]]
A common furniture pest is the [[powderpost beetle]], less than a quarter-inch long, which lays its eggs in small crevices. The insect larvae burrow into the wood, creating networks of tunnels as they eat their way along the grain. As they mature to adults, they bore out of the wood leaving an “exit” or “flight” hole and fly off to lay their eggs, completing the cycle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your-treasures/furniture#.VTkbESFVikp  "Insect Activity," American Institute for Conservation  of Historic and Artistic Works, accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your-treasures/furniture#.VTJgzSHBzGc]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Photo to the right—''

Here is another '''case study''' of an early 19th-century bed with an infestation of woodworms from The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston:

"To protect the bed from damage and prevent pests from spreading to other works of art, it was critical to treat the new acquisition before it entered the building. Conservators completely sealed the bed in a giant impermeable bag and placed an oxygen scavenger inside. In this case, the scavenger was made of fine iron particles. Iron reacts rapidly with oxygen, binding the gas itself and thereby removing it from the air. With the appropriate amount of scavenger in the sealed environment, the conservators brought the oxygen down from normal air levels of 20 percent to less than 0.1 percent. After about four weeks in containment, all of the bed's woodworms in all life stages suffocated. Then the object could be safely brought into the Museum. No toxic chemicals were involved in the treatment, and the conservators disposed of the spent scavenger safely."&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Richard. (2009) ''Conservation: MFA Highlights.''(Pg. 132) United States: Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Handling and moving furniture====
Perhaps the greatest cause of damage to furniture is people due to misuse and mishandling, creating physical damage.&lt;ref&gt;Capadose, Jeremy. (2011) Furniture. In ''The National Trust Manual of Housekeeping: Care and conservation of collections in historic houses'' (Pg. 365). Swindon, Wiltshire. National Trust Books.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Always'' wear clean cotton gloves and handle objects as little as possible. Check furniture for damage or loose joins before moving it. Remove objects from the surface and then remove drawers, shelves, and doors. Elements that cannot be removed should be secured with soft cloth (cotton) straps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/furniture-meubles/449-eng.aspx CCI-ICC, "How to Care for Wooden Furniture," 4/1/2002. accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/furniture-meubles/449-eng.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as structural damage, dents, surface wear, scratches, stains and wax from candles are all evidence of past use. Water splashed from repeated floor washing, or spilt from flower displays damages bare or polished surfaces, most commonly leaving white marks. Cups and glasses leave 'rings' on polished surfaces. Alcohol spilt will remove the polished surface almost instantly.&lt;ref&gt;Capadose, Jeremy. (2011) Furniture. In ''The National Trust Manual of Housekeeping: Care and conservation of collections in historic houses'' (Pg. 365). Swindon, Wiltshire. National Trust Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Furniture maintenance==
For the most part, maintaining furniture simply means keeping it clean, carefully.&lt;ref&gt;https://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/smithsonianmcifurniturecare.pdf Smithsonian ''Museum Conservation Institute,'' "Furniture Care and Handling" Page 10. accessed 4/23/2015 [https://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/smithsonianmcifurniturecare.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleaning===
Furniture oils are not recommended for maintenance as many of them contain linseed oil or other drying oils, and when used repeatedly will create a gummy, insoluble surface coating that darkens and obscures the grain of the wood. Other furniture polishes contain non-drying oils such as lemon oil, but attract and entrap dirt and grime. Silicone polishes are also not recommended as they leave a film that is difficult to remove and can interfere with future finish treatments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your-treasures/furniture#.VTkbESFVikp "Caring for Your Treasures," American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your-treasures/furniture#.VTJgzSHBzGc]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tools for furniture care===
The Hammond-Harwood House and City of Bowie Museums Collector’s Corner Workshop Series provides a resource on Furniture Cleaning and Care which addresses the tools and techniques of furniture cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;https://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/furniture-cleaning-and-care-handout.pdf Hammond-Harwood House, City of Bowie Museums. "Furniture Cleaning and Care," Pages 1-2, accessed 4/23/2015 [https://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/furniture-cleaning-and-care-handout.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Petroleum-free nitrile gloves
*Cotton cloths
*Synthetic cloths, “Pel cloth” and “Preserve-It” 
*Brushes, “Hake” or “Windsor-Newton” brushes
*Distilled water
*Liquefied hide glue, “Titebond Liquid Hide Glue,” “Old Brown Glue”
*Cotton swab, balls, or wool
*Brush cleaner, “The Master’s”
*Paste or butchers wax, “Butchers,” “Johnson,” “Goddard’s,” and “Trewax,”

[https://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/index-eng.aspx The Canadian Conservation Institute] recommends that Micro-crystalline wax (a scent- and colour-free white paste wax that is available at specialty tool supply stores) can be used to increase the gloss of the finish, which will make it easier to remove fingerprints. Do this only once a year and only to the surfaces that are handled, being careful to avoid wax build-up around metal fittings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/furniture-meubles/449-eng.aspx CCI-ICC, "How to Care for Wooden Furniture," 4/1/2002. accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/furniture-meubles/449-eng.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
The [http://www.si.edu/mci/english/professional_development/past_courses_programs/programs/FCTP.html Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute] has a graduate-level course of study Furniture Conservation Training Program that was established in 1986.

[[Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library]] sponsors two graduate programs with The [http://www.artcons.udel.edu/ University of Delaware]. The [http://www.winterthur.org/?p=634 Winterthur] program in American Material Culture, founded in 1952, and the Winterthur-University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation founded in 1974.

[[File:Corinth excavation view 1905.jpg|thumb|300px|View of the excavations in 1905.]]

The '''Corinth Excavations''' by the [[American School of Classical Studies at Athens]] began in 1896 and have continued with little interruption until today. Restricted by the modern village of [[Ancient Corinth]], which directly overlies the ancient city, the main focus of School investigations has been on the area surrounding the mid-6th century B.C. Temple of Apollo.  This dominating monument has been one of the only features of the site visible since antiquity.  Archaeologists such as [[Bert Hodge Hill]], [[Carl Blegen]], [[William Bell Dinsmoor|William Dinsmoor, Sr.]], [[Oscar Broneer]], and [[Rhys Carpenter]] worked to uncover much of the site before WWII.&lt;ref name="Corinth Multimedia Presentation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.ascsa.edu.gr/media/corinth/corinth.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112133359/http://www3.ascsa.edu.gr/media/corinth/corinth.html |archivedate=2011-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, under the leadership of directors Henry Robinson (1959-1965), Charles K. Williams II (1965-1997) and Guy D. R. Sanders (1997–present), excavation has clarified the archaeological history of the city.  Investigations have revealed remains extending from the Early Neolithic period (6500-5750 B.C.) through to early modern times.

Archaeological work has also been done outside the immediate area of the village center including at the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore on the slopes of [[Acrocorinth]], in the Potters’ Quarter, at the sites of the Sanctuary of Asklepios and the Kenchreian Gate Basilica.&lt;ref name="demeter1"&gt;N. Bookidis and R. S. Stroud, ''Corinth XVIII, iii: The Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore: Topography and Architecture'', Princeton 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Current investigations focus on the area of the Panayia Field, located to the southeast of the Forum. School excavations and projects affiliated to the ASCSA have also intensively explored the wider area of the Corinthia including the surrounding settlements of Korakou, [[Kenchreai]] and [[Isthmian Games]].  Finds from these works are housed in the [[Archaeological Museum of Ancient Corinth]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19700">'''Cultural heritage management''' ('''CHM''') is the vocation and practice of managing [[cultural heritage]].&lt;ref&gt; Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a branch of [[cultural resources management]] (CRM), although it also draws on the practices of [[cultural conservation]], [[building restoration|restoration]], [[museology]], [[archaeology]], [[history]] and [[architecture]].  While the term cultural heritage is generally used in Europe, in the USA the term cultural resources is in more general use specifically referring to cultural ''heritage'' resources.  CHM has traditionally been concerned with the identification, interpretation, maintenance, and preservation of significant cultural sites and physical heritage assets, although intangible aspects of heritage, such as traditional skills, cultures and languages are also considered.  The subject typically receives most attention, and resources, in the face of threat, where the focus is often upon rescue or salvage archaeology.  Possible threats include urban development, large-scale agriculture, mining activity, looting, erosion or unsustainable visitor numbers. The public face of CHM, and a significant source of income to support continued management of heritage, is the interpretation and presentation to the public, where it is an important aspect of tourism.  Communicating with government and the public is therefore a key competence.

==The development of CHM==
CHM has its roots in the [[rescue archaeology]] and [[urban archaeology]] undertaken throughout [[North America]] and [[Europe]] in the years surrounding [[World War II]] and the succeeding decades.  Salvage projects were hasty attempts to identify and rescue archaeological remains before they were destroyed to make room for large public-works projects or other construction.  In the early days of salvage archaeology, it was nearly unheard-of for a project to be delayed because of the presence of even the most fascinating cultural sites, so it behooved the salvage archaeologists to work as fast as possible. Although many sites were lost, much data was saved for posterity through these salvage efforts.

In more recent decades, legislation has been passed that emphasizes the identification and protection of cultural sites, especially those on public lands.  In the United States, the most notable of these laws remains the [[National Historic Preservation Act]]. The administration of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was most instrumental in passing and developing this legislation, although it has been extended and elaborated upon since.  These laws make it a crime to develop any federal lands without conducting a cultural resources survey in order to identify and assess any cultural sites that may be affected. In the [[United Kingdom]], [[PPG 16]] has been instrumental in improving the management of historic sites in the face of development.

The subject has developed from an emphasis on preservation of material culture (by record if not by physical remains), to encompass the broader concepts of culture, which are inseparable from the local communities.  Modern thinking takes the view that cultural heritage belongs to the people, therefore access to cultural heritage has to be ensured.  The public reaction to the proposed destruction of the [[Newport ship]] shows the importance of heritage to local communities.

The legislation of individual nations is often based upon ratification of [[UNESCO]] conventions, such as the [[world heritage|1972 World Heritage Convention]], the [[Valletta treaty]] and the [[Underwater cultural heritage|2001 Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage]].  Specific legislation is sometimes needed to ensure the appropriate protection of individual sites recognized as [[World Heritage Sites]].

==Cultural heritage assessment==
{{See also|Cultural landscape|Values (heritage)}}
While [[archaeological site]]s remain the primary focus for many CRM professional, others research historical records or on [[ethnohistory|ethnohistorical]] projects.  Public outreach also falls within their purview. A recent concept is [[Traditional Cultural Property]] or TCP. These are places with cultural importance to a group that may not be either particularly historical or an archaeological site. An example would be a location used for contemporary [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] religious events that has no archaeological remains.

A phase of evaluation is considered important in assessing the significance of a possible cultural heritage site. This can comprise a desk-based study, interviews with informants in the community, a wide-area survey, or trial trenching. In North America, survey normally includes either walking ploughed fields in 5–10-metre transects or digging shovel test pits at the same intervals. The soil from the test pits is sifted through 6&amp;nbsp;mm mesh to look for artifacts. If artifacts are found, the next stage of investigation is usually digging and sifting a spaced grid of [[test pits]] (1 m by 1 m trenches) to determine how large or significant the site is.

==Mitigation==
{{See also|Rescue archaeology}}
In the United Kingdom and Canada, all forms of development, public and private, are subject to archaeological requirements, while in the United States this work can only be undertaken in federally funded projects or those on government-owned land, except in a few states that have laws that apply also to private land.

Where archaeological requirements apply to a site of proposed development, if no significant archaeological or other cultural property sites are found in the impacted area, construction may proceed as planned, often with the requirement that archaeologists are on-site providing a watching brief. If potentially significant remains are found, construction may be delayed to allow for evaluation of the site or sites found within the impacted area. This is done to determine the archaeological site's true significance. If archaeologists determine the site contains important/significant cultural remains, the adverse effects on the site must be mitigated. Site mitigation can involve avoiding the site through redesigning the development or excavating only a percentage of the site. In the U.S., these restrictions involve any federal project involving the possible disturbance of cultural resources and can also extend to state and private developments if they involve public waterways or federal funds.

If archaeologists determine the site contains highly significant cultural remains, the adverse development effects on the site must be mitigated through a structured programme that is often long and expensive. Mitigation can include preservation by record i.e. the site is destroyed by archaeological excavation rather than by the development and meticulous recording transfers the physical traces in the earth to information in archives.   Mitigation also includes construction techniques which ensure that archaeological remains are protected in undisturbed parts of the site or even underneath the development.  An example of this type of mitigation is the Viking remains at [[York]].

Important sites are designated as being protected by the state so that no development at all can take place, and governments also recommend the most important sites to be recognised as World Heritage Sites.

==The effect of CHM on archaeology==
CHM has been a mixed blessing for archaeology. Preservation legislation has ensured that no valuable site will be destroyed by construction without study, but the work of rescue archaeologists is sometimes controversial. Some academic archaeologists do not take archaeological rescue or salvage work seriously because of its emphasis on site identification and preservation rather than intensive study and analysis.   Where archaeology is motivated by proposed development, the archaeological contracts are placed through a bidding process.  The choice of archaeological contractor typically lies with the developer and there is little incentive to prevent the company responsible for construction selecting the bid with the lowest price estimate, or shortest investigation time, regardless of the archaeological merits of the submitted bids.

The impact of archaeological rescue and salvage work has been considerable; given the large amount of construction, and that the bulk of archaeological work in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom is developer led.  Unfortunately, the large number of reports written on the thousands of sites dug each year are not necessarily published in public forums. So-called [[grey literature]] is sometimes difficult for even archaeologists outside the developer or the CRM organisation that performed the work to access. Some initiatives, notably the [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/project/oasis/ OASIS project] of the Archaeological Data Service in the UK, are beginning to make the reports available to everyone.

==Heritage curation and interpretation==
{{Main|Heritage interpretation|Museology|Art conservation and restoration}}
[[File:Seaton carew interpretation board.JPG|thumb|Noticeboard interpreting the protected wreck at [[Seaton Carew Wreck|Seaton Carew]]]]
Curation refers to the long-term preservation and retention of heritage assets and to providing access to them in a variety of forms.  Fragile heritage assets may need to be preserved in a special environment, and protected from light (especially [[ultra-violet]]), [[humidity]], fluctations in [[temperature]] and in some cases, [[oxygen]] from the air.  Large [[museums]] generally employ specialist conservators as well as [[education]] officers, [[archivist]]s and [[research]]ers. 

Museums vary in their approach to interpretation ranging from traditional museums that display collections of artefacts behind glass, with labels identifying each item and giving [[provenance]], to [[living museum]]s which attempt to recreate a historical place or period so that people can experience it.  

Within a single museum, a range of approaches may be used including interpretative panels, presenting artefacts in a realistic setting as they would have been experienced, and creating interactive and virtual exhibits.  Museums also have processes to loan artefacts to other institutions or exhibitions.  Interpretative panels, and other signage, such as [[Blue plaque]]s in the UK are important in ensuring that cultural heritage is understood in the context of the local community.

==Historic preservation and restoration==
{{See also|Historic preservation|Conservation area|Building restoration}}
[[File:heritage.rail.750pix.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A scene on the [[West Somerset Railway]]]]
Preservation and restoration usually refers to architectural or engineering heritage assets such as heritage buildings or other structures and [[Heritage railways]].  The UK has a number of different forms of protection for buildings and structures, including [[listed buildings]], [[conservation area]]s and [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]]s.  In France a building or other structure can be protected as a [[Monument historique]].  Successful heritage management for a building generally requires that the building continues to be used, as disused buildings are likely to deteriorate quickly.  If the purpose for which the building was originally constructed is no longer viable, then other uses, often requiring sympathetic modification must be found.

Heritage machinery, such as [[Antique car|antique]] or [[vintage car]]s and [[heritage railway]]s can best be understood and are best accessed and experienced by the public when they are in an operational condition.  Moreover, the heritage [[skills]] associated with such heritage assets, such as driving a steam locomotive, can only be maintained if the machinery is used.  Restoration to a working, if not pristine condition, and creation of exact working replicas are therefore part of the practice of heritage management.

==Managing intangible cultural heritage==
{{See also|Intangible culture|Folklore}}
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Sitar-1927.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Sitar]], a traditional Indian musical instrument]] --&gt;
[[File:Bronze age dwelling at Flag Fen.JPG|thumb|250px|A reconstruction of a Bronze Age dwelling at [[Flag Fen]]]]
The intangible cultural heritage consists of traditional skills, [[beliefs]], [[traditions]], [[oral tradition]]s, [[music]], [[songs]], [[dance]], [[drama]] etc.  These cannot be stored in a museum but are constantly reinterpreted by the people in a particular [[cultural region]].   The management of intangible cultural heritage is difficult as it requires consideration of the lives and living conditions of local communities.  Some countries such as [[Centre for Cultural Resources and Training|India]] and the members of the [[Committee on Education, Culture, Tourism and Human Resources|African union]] have recognised the importance of cultural resources and established government departments to manage them.

==Roman temple==
Behind the village there are the ruins of a [[Roman temple]] that still retains a central [[courtyard]] and a front [[colonnade]] composed of three columns. The temple was converted into a [[church (building)|church]] and a [[chapel]] can be accessed via an opening in the west wall. There is a path leading from the temple to an ancient [[graveyard]] with tombs and [[sarcophagi]]&lt;ref name="CollectifLabourdette2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AuziasLabourdette2012"/&gt;. 

George Taylor noted the temple was aligned to the south west and classified it as a [[Prostylos temple]]. He noted that the decoration of the window, [[cornice]] and [[capital (architecture)|capital]] displayed a design unique in Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Taylor1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Taylor|title=The Roman temples of Lebanon: a pictorial guide.

[[File:Paris July 2011-30.jpg|thumb|The [[Arc de Triomphe]] of the [[Place de l'Étoile]], one of the most famous example of Empire architecture, commissioned in 1806 after the victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] by [[Napoleon|Emperor Napoleon I]]]]
The '''Empire style''' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃.piːʁ}}, ''style Empire'') is an early-nineteenth-century [[design]] movement in [[architecture]], [[furniture]], other [[decorative arts]], and the [[visual arts]], representing the second phase of [[Neoclassicism]]. It flourished between 1800 and 1815 during the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] and the [[First French Empire]] periods, although its life span lasted until the late-1820s. From France it spread into much of Europe and the United States. 

The style originated in and takes its name from the rule of the Emperor [[Napoleon I]] in the [[First French Empire]], when it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The previous fashionable style in France had been the [[Directoire style]], a more austere and minimalist form of Neoclassicism, that replaced the [[Louis XVI style]].  The Empire style brought a full return to ostentatious richness.  The style corresponds somewhat to the [[Biedermeier]] style in the German-speaking lands, [[Federal style]] in the United States, and the [[Regency style]] in Britain. 

==History==
[[File:Versailles Grand Trianon Napoleon's Chamber.jpg|thumb|Napoleon's bedchamber in the [[Grand Trianon]], [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] epitomizes the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical style]] of the [[First French Empire]]]]

The style developed and elaborated the Directoire style of the immediately preceding period, which aimed at a simpler, but still elegant evocation of the virtues of the [[Ancient Roman Republic]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[stoicism|stoic]] virtues of Republican Rome were upheld as standards not merely for the arts but also for political behaviour and private morality. ''Conventionels'' saw themselves as antique heroes. Children were named after [[Brutus]], [[Solon]] and [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]. The festivals of the Revolution were staged by [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] as antique rituals.  Even the chairs in which the committee of ''Salut Publique'' sat were made on antique models devised by David. ...In fact Neo-classicism became fashionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Honour|1977|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Empire style "turned to the florid opulence of Imperial Rome. The abstemious severity of [[Doric order|Doric]] was replaced by [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] richness and splendour".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Honour|1977|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two French architects, [[Charles Percier]] and [[Pierre François Léonard Fontaine|Pierre Fontaine]], were together the creators of the French Empire style. The two had studied in [[Rome]] and in the 1790s became leading furniture designers in [[Paris]], where they received many commissions from Napoleon and other statesmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fredlund |first=Jane |year=2008 |title=Stilguiden: möbler &amp; inredning 1700–2000 |edition=2nd |location=Stockholm |publisher=Prisma |page=108 |oclc=234047178 |isbn=9789151849874 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architecture of the Empire style was based on elements of the [[Roman Empire]] and its many archaeological treasures, which had been rediscovered starting in the eighteenth century.  The preceding Louis XVI and [[Directoire (style)|Directoire]] styles employed straighter, simpler designs compared to the [[Rococo]] style of the eighteenth century.  Empire designs strongly influenced the contemporary American [[Federal style]] (such as design of the [[United States Capitol]] building), and both were forms of [[propaganda]] through architecture.  It was a style of the people, not ostentatious but sober and evenly balanced.  The style was considered to have "liberated" and "enlightened" architecture just as Napoleon "liberated" the peoples of Europe with his [[Napoleonic Code]].
[[File:Église de la Madeleine 3753x3156.jpg|left|thumb|[[Église de la Madeleine]] in [[Paris]], a Temple to the Glory of Napoleon's [[Grande Armée]]]]
The Empire period was popularized by the inventive designs of [[Percier and Fontaine]], Napoleon's architects for [[Château de Malmaison|Malmaison]].  The designs drew for inspiration on symbols and ornaments borrowed from the glorious ancient Greek and Roman empires.  Buildings typically had simple timber frames and box-like constructions, [[wood veneer|veneer]]ed in expensive [[mahogany]] imported from the [[colonies]]. Biedermeier furniture also used [[ebony]] details, originally due to financial constraints. [[Ormolu]] details (gilded bronze furniture mounts and embellishments) displayed a high level of craftsmanship.

[[File:View to Kazan Cathedral by Ivan Smelov.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].]]

General Bernadotte, later to become King [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Karl Johan]] of Sweden and Norway, introduced the Napoleonic style to Sweden, where it became known under his own name. The Karl Johan style remained popular in Scandinavia even as the Empire style disappeared from other parts of Europe. France paid some of its debts to Sweden in ormolu bronzes instead of money, leading to a vogue for crystal [[chandeliers]] with bronze from France and crystal from Sweden.

After Napoleon lost power, the Empire style continued to be in favour for many decades, with minor adaptations.  There was a revival of the style in the last half of the nineteenth century in France, again at the beginning of the twentieth century, and again in the 1980s.

The most famous Empire-style structures in France are the grand neoclassical [[Arc de Triomphe|Arc de Triomphe of Place de l'Étoile]], [[Place du Carrousel#The Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel|Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel]], [[Vendôme column]], and [[Église de la Madeleine|La Madeleine]], which were built in Paris to emulate the edifices of the Roman Empire.  The style also was used widely in [[Imperial Russia]], where it was used to celebrate the victory over Napoleon in such memorial structures as the [[General Staff Building (Saint Petersburg)|General Staff Building]], [[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]], [[Alexander Column]], and [[Narva Triumphal Gate]]. [[Stalinist architecture]] is sometimes referred to as Stalin's Empire style.

The style survived in Italy longer than in most of Europe, partly because of its Imperial Roman associations, partly because it was revived as a national style of architecture following the unification of Italy in 1870. [[Mario Praz]] wrote about this style as the Italian Empire.  In the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States, the Empire style was adapted to local conditions and gradually acquired further expression as the [[Egyptian Revival]], [[Greek Revival]], [[Biedermeier|Biedermeier style]], [[Regency style]], and [[Federal style|late-Federal style]].

'''Expansionist nationalism''' is an aggressive and radical form of [[nationalism]] that incorporates autonomous, patriotic sentiments with a belief in [[expansionism]]. The term was coined during the late nineteenth century as European powers indulged in the '[[Scramble for Africa]]' in the name of national glory, but has been most associated with militarist governments during the 20th century including [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist_regime_.281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist Italy]], [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Japanese empire]], and the [[Balkans]] countries of [[Albanian nationalism|Albania]] ([[Greater Albania]]), [[Bulgarian nationalism|Bulgaria]] ([[Greater Bulgaria]]), [[Croatian nationalism|Croatia]] ([[Greater Croatia]]), [[Hungarian nationalism|Hungary]] ([[Hungarian irredentism|Greater Hungary]]), [[Romanian nationalism|Romania]] ([[Greater Romania]]) and [[Serbian nationalism|Serbia]] ([[Greater Serbia]]).

== Ideology ==
What distinguishes expansionist nationalism from [[liberal nationalism]] is its acceptance of [[chauvinism]], a belief in superiority or dominance. Nations are thus not thought to be equal to their right to self-determination; rather some nations are believed to possess characteristics or qualities that make them superior to others. Expansionist nationalism therefore asserts the state's right to increase its borders at the expense of its neighbours.

'''Flagstaff''' is a [[ghost town]] and former [[New England town|town]] in [[Somerset County, Maine|Somerset County]], [[Maine]], [[United States]], near the existing town of [[Eustis, Maine|Eustis]] and about 20 miles north of [[Rangeley, Maine|Rangeley]]. 

[[Benedict Arnold]] camped here on his Quebec expedition and erected a flagstaff, hence the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt. Print. Off. | author=Gannett, Henry | year=1905 | pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town was abandoned and dismantled (and legally disincorporated) in 1950 to allow construction of a hydroelectric dam on the [[Dead River (Kennebec River)|Dead River]], which enlarged [[Flagstaff Lake (Maine)|Flagstaff Lake]] and submerged the site of the settlement. 

The song "Below" by [[Slaid Cleaves]] on his 2004 album ''Wishbones'' refers to the destruction of the town, although it is not mentioned by name. The lyrics specifically mention the Dead River, and its general location.

'''Frank Plumpton Ramsey''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|m|z|i}}; 22 February 1903 – 19 January 1930) was a British [[philosopher]], [[mathematician]] and [[economist]] who made fundamental contributions to abstract algebra before his death at the age of 26. He was a close friend of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and was instrumental in translating Wittgenstein's ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' into English, as well as persuading Wittgenstein to return to philosophy and Cambridge. Like Wittgenstein, he was a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles]], the intellectual secret society, from 1921.

==Life==

Ramsey was born on 22 February 1903 in [[Cambridge]] where his father [[Arthur Stanley Ramsey]] (1867–1954), also a mathematician, was President of [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene College]]. His mother was Mary Agnes Stanley (1875–1927). He was the eldest of two brothers and two sisters, and his brother [[Michael Ramsey]], the only one of the four siblings who was to remain Christian, later became [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. He entered [[Winchester College]] in 1915 and later returned to Cambridge to study mathematics at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]]. While studying mathematics at Trinity College, Ramsey became a student to [[John Maynard Keynes]], and an active member in the Apostles, a Cambridge discussion group. In 1923, he received his bachelor's degree in mathematics, passing his examinations with the result of [[British undergraduate degree classification|first class]] with distinction.  He was named [[Senior Wrangler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Ramsey|first=Frank P.|title=Frank P. Ramsey's Papers| url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead&amp;cc=ascead&amp;rgn=main&amp;view=text&amp;didno=US-PPiU-asp198301|publisher=Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=19 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Easy-going, simple and modest, Ramsey had many interests besides his scientific work. Even as a teenager Ramsey exhibited both a profound ability and, as attested by his brother, an extremely diverse range of interests:

{{Quotation|He was interested in almost everything. He was immensely widely read in [[English literature]]; he was enjoying [[classics]] though he was on the verge of plunging into being a mathematical specialist; he was very interested in politics, and well-informed; he had got a political concern and a sort of left-wing caring-for-the-underdog kind of outlook about politics.|Michael Ramsey|Quoted in Mellor}}

In 1923, Ramsey was befriended by [[Geoffrey Pyke|Geoffrey]] and [[Margaret Pyke]], then on the point of founding the [[Malting House School]] in Cambridge; the Pykes took Ramsey into their family, taking him on holiday and asking him to be the godfather of their young son. Margaret found herself to be the object of his affection, Ramsey recording in his diary: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One afternoon I went out alone with her on [[Lake Orta]] and became filled with desire and we came back and lay on two beds side by side she reading, I pretending to, but with an awful conflict in my mind. After about an hour I said (she was wearing her horn spectacles and looking superlatively beautiful in the Burne Jones style) ‘Margaret will you fuck with me?’&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Ramsey's Diary, 13 January 1924 by Forrester, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Margaret wanted time to consider his proposition and thus began an uncomfortable dance between them, which contributed to Ramsey's depressive moods in early 1924; as a result he travelled to Vienna for [[psychoanalysis]]. He, like many of his contemporaries, including his Viennese flatmate and fellow Apostle [[Lionel Penrose]] (also in analysis with [[Siegfried Bernfeld]]), was intellectually interested in psychoanalysis. Ramsey's analyst was [[Theodor Reik]], a disciple of [[Freud]]. As one of the justifications for undertaking the therapy, he asserted in a letter to his mother that unconscious impulses might even affect the work of a mathematician. While in Vienna, he visited Wittgenstein in Puchberg, was befriended by the Wittgenstein family and visited [[A.S. Neill]]'s experimental school four hours from Vienna at Sonntagsberg. In the summer of 1924, he continued his analysis by joining Reik at Dobbiaco (in [[South Tyrol]]), where a fellow analysand was [[Lewis Namier]]. Ramsey returned to England in October 1924; with [[John Maynard Keynes]]'s support he became a fellow of [[King's College, Cambridge]]. He joined a Psychoanalysis Group in Cambridge with fellow members [[Arthur Tansley]], [[Lionel Penrose]], [[Harold Jeffreys]], [[John Rickman]] and [[James Strachey]], the qualification for membership of which was a completed psychoanalysis.

Ramsey married Lettice Baker in September 1925, the wedding taking place in a Register Office since Ramsey was, as his wife described him, a ‘militant [[atheist]]'. After Ramsey's death, [[Lettice Ramsey]] opened a photography studio in Cambridge with photographer [[Helen Muspratt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.helenmuspratt-photographer.com/life/biography/|website=Helen Muspratt - Photographer|accessdate=29 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718182823/http://www.helenmuspratt-photographer.com/life/biography|archivedate=18 July 2016|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage produced two daughters. Despite his [[atheism]], Ramsey was quite tolerant towards his brother when the latter decided to become a priest in the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;"He was certainly sorry that I went on being religious; he was sorry that I decided to become a priest in the Church of England; sorry indeed, but quite tolerant." Quoted in Mellor, "Ramsey", p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926 he became a university lecturer in mathematics and later a Director of Studies in Mathematics at King's College.
The [[Vienna Circle]] manifesto (1929) lists three of his publications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Frank P. Ramsey | title=Universals | journal=Mind | volume=34 | number= | pages=401&amp;mdash;417 | year=1925 | doi=10.1093/mind/xxxiv.136.401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Frank P.

==Ramsey and Wittgenstein==

When [[I. A. Richards]] and [[C. K. Ogden]], both Fellows of [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene]], first met Ramsey, he expressed his interest in learning German. According to Richards, he mastered the language "in almost hardly over a week",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Mellor, "Ramsey", p. 245,&lt;/ref&gt; although other sources show he had taken one year of German in school.&lt;ref&gt;See Gabriele
Taylor (in Galavotti 2006, 1–18) and Duarte (2009a)&lt;/ref&gt; Ramsey was then able, at the age of 19, to make the first draft of the translation of the German text of [[Wittgenstein]]'s ''[[Tractatus Logico Philosophicus]]''. Ramsey was impressed by Wittgenstein's work and after graduating as [[Senior Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Senior Wrangler]] in the Mathematical [[Tripos]] of 1923 he made a journey to [[Austria]] to visit Wittgenstein, at that time teaching in a primary school in the small community of [[Puchberg am Schneeberg]]. For two weeks Ramsey discussed the difficulties he was facing in understanding the ''Tractatus''. Wittgenstein made some corrections to the English translation in Ramsey's copy and some annotations and changes to the German text that subsequently appeared in the second edition in 1933.

Ramsey and [[John Maynard Keynes]] cooperated to try to bring [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] back to Cambridge (he had been a student there before World War I). Once Wittgenstein had returned to Cambridge, Ramsey became his nominal supervisor.  Wittgenstein submitted the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' as his doctoral thesis. [[G.E. Moore]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] acted as examiners. Later, the three of them arranged financial aid for Wittgenstein to help him continue his research work.

In 1929 Ramsey and Wittgenstein regularly discussed issues in mathematics and philosophy with [[Piero Sraffa]], an [[Italians|Italian]] economist who had been brought to Cambridge by Keynes after Sraffa had aroused [[Benito Mussolini]]'s ire by publishing an article critical of the Fascist regime in the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]''. The contributions of Ramsey to these conversations were acknowledged by both Sraffa and Wittgenstein in their later work.

==Early death==

Suffering from chronic [[liver]] problems, Ramsey developed [[jaundice]] after an abdominal operation and died on 19 January 1930 at [[Guy's Hospital]] in London at the age of 26.

He is buried in the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground]] in Cambridge; his parents are buried in the same plot.&lt;ref&gt;A Guide to Churchill College, Cambridge: text by Dr. [[Mark Goldie]], pages 62 and 63 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsey's notes and manuscripts were acquired by [[Nicholas Rescher]] for the [[Archives of Scientific Philosophy]] and the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. This collection contains only a few letters but a great many drafts of papers and book chapters, some still unpublished. Other papers, including his diary and letters and memoirs by his widow Lettice Ramsey and his father, are held in the Modern Archives, King's College, Cambridge.

==Work==

===Mathematical logic===
One of the [[theorem]]s proved by Ramsey in his 1928 paper ''On a problem of formal logic'' now bears his name ([[Ramsey's theorem]]). While this theorem is the work Ramsey is probably best remembered for, he only proved it in passing, as a minor [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] along the way to his true goal in the paper, solving a special case of the [[Entscheidungsproblem|decision problem for first-order logic]], namely the [[decidability (logic)|decidability]] of what is now called the [[Bernays-Schonfinkel class|Bernays–Schönfinkel–Ramsey class]] of first-order logic, as well as a characterisation of the spectrum of sentences in this fragment of logic. [[Alonzo Church]] would go on to show that the general case of the decision problem for first-order logic is [[Unsolvable problem|unsolvable]] (see [[Church's theorem]]). A great amount of later work in mathematics was fruitfully developed out of the ostensibly minor lemma, which turned out to be an important early result in [[combinatorics]], supporting the idea that within some sufficiently large systems, however disordered, there must be some order. So fruitful, in fact, was Ramsey's theorem that today there is an entire branch of mathematics, known as [[Ramsey theory]], which is dedicated to studying similar results.

===Philosophy===
His philosophical works included ''Universals'' (1925), ''Facts and propositions'' (1927) (which proposed a [[redundancy theory of truth]]), ''Universals of law and of fact'' (1928), ''Knowledge'' (1929), ''Theories'' (1929), ''On Truth'' (1929), and ''General propositions and causality'' (1929). Wittgenstein mentions him in the introduction to his ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' as an influence.

===Economics===

Keynes and Pigou encouraged Ramsey to work on economics as "From a very early age, about sixteen I think, his precocious mind was intensely interested in economic problems" (Keynes, 1933). Ramsey responded to Keynes's urging by writing three papers in economic theory all of which were of fundamental importance, though it was many years before they received their proper recognition by the community of economists.

Ramsey's three papers, described below in detail, were on [[subjective probability]] and [[utility]] (1926), [[optimal]] allocation (1927) and optimal one-sector [[Ramsey growth model|economic growth]] (1928). The economist [[Paul Samuelson]] described them in 1970 as "three great legacies – legacies that were for the most part mere by-products of his major interest in the foundations of mathematics and knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul A. |last=Samuelson |title=What Makes for a Beautiful Problem in Science? |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=78 |issue=6 |year=1970 |pages=1372–1377 |doi=10.1086/259716 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====A mathematical theory of saving====

This significant paper was published in ''[[The Economic Journal]]'', and involved "a strategically beautiful application of the [[calculus of variations]]" ([[Paul Samuelson]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul A. |last=Samuelson |title=What Makes for a Beautiful Problem in Science? |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=78 |issue=6 |year=1970 |pages=1372–1377 |doi=10.1086/259716 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to determine the optimal amount an economy should invest (save) rather than consume so as to maximise future [[utility]], or in Ramsey's words "how much of its income should a nation save?" (Ramsey, 1928).

Keynes described the article as "one of the most remarkable contributions to [[mathematical economics]] ever made, both in respect of the intrinsic importance and difficulty of its subject, the power and elegance of the technical methods employed, and the clear purity of illumination with which the writer's mind is felt by the reader to play about its subject. The article is terribly difficult reading for an economist, but it is not difficult to appreciate how scientific and aesthetic qualities are combined in it together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keynes|first1=John Maynard|title=F. P. Ramsey|journal=Economic Journal|date=March 1930|volume=40|issue=157|page=153|jstor=2223657}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ramsey model is today acknowledged as the starting point for [[Turnpike theory|optimal accumulation theory]] although its importance was not recognised until many years after its first publication.

The main contributions of the model were firstly the initial question Ramsey posed on how much savings should be and secondly the method of analysis, the intertemporal maximisation (optimisation) of collective or individual utility by applying techniques of dynamic optimisation. [[Tjalling C. Koopmans]] and [[David Cass]] modified the Ramsey model incorporating the dynamic features of [[population growth]] at a steady rate and of Harrod-neutral technical progress again at a steady rate, giving birth to a model named the [[Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model]] where the objective now is to maximise household's [[utility function]].

====A contribution to the theory of taxation====

In this paper Ramsey's contribution to [[economic theory]] was the elegant concept of [[Ramsey pricing]]. This is applicable in situations where a (regulated) [[monopolist]] wants to maximise [[consumer surplus]] whilst at the same time ensuring that its costs are adequately covered. This is achieved by setting the price such that the markup over [[marginal cost]] is inversely proportional to the [[price elasticity]] of demand for that good. Like its predecessor this paper was published in The Economic Journal in 1927. Ramsey poses the question that is to be solved at the beginning of the article: "a given revenue is to be raised by proportionate taxes on some or all uses of income, the taxes on different uses being possibly at different rates; how much should these rates be adjusted in order that the decrement of utility may be a minimum?" (Ramsey 1927). The problem was suggested to him by the economist [[Arthur Pigou]] and the paper was Ramsey's answer to the problem.

====Truth and probability====

Keynes in his ''[[A Treatise on Probability]]'' (1921) argued against the subjective approach in [[epistemic]] probabilities. For Keynes, subjectivity of probabilities doesn't matter as much, as for him there is an objective relationship between knowledge and probabilities, as knowledge is disembodied and not personal.

Ramsey in his article disagrees with Keynes's approach as for him there is a difference between the notions of [[probability]] in [[physics]] and in [[logic]]. For Ramsey probability is not related to a disembodied body of knowledge but is related to the knowledge that each individual possesses alone. Thus personal beliefs that are formulated by this individual knowledge govern probabilities, leading to the notions of [[subjective probability]] and [[Bayesian probability]]. Consequently, subjective probabilities can be inferred by observing actions that reflect individuals' personal beliefs. Ramsey argued that the degree of probability that an individual attaches to a particular outcome can be measured by finding what [[odds]] the individual would accept when [[betting]] on that outcome.
	
Ramsey suggested a way of deriving a consistent theory of choice under uncertainty that could isolate beliefs from preferences while still maintaining subjective probabilities.

Despite the fact that Ramsey's work on probabilities was of great importance again no one paid any attention to it until the publication of ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' of [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] in 1944 (1947 2nd ed.)

{{Basic forms of government}}
{{Politics sidebar|expanded=Subseries}}
A '''government''' is the system or group of people governing an organized community, often a [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=government|publisher=''Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford University Press|date=November 2010|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of [[legislature]], [[Executive (government)|executive]], and [[judiciary]]. Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining [[policy]]. Each government has a kind of [[constitution]], a statement of its governing principles and philosophy. Typically the philosophy chosen is some balance between the principle of individual [[freedom]] and the idea of absolute state authority ([[tyranny]]).

While all types of organizations have governance, the word ''government'' is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 [[List of sovereign states|independent national governments]] on [[Earth]], as well as subsidiary organizations.&lt;ref name=EncycSocialSciences&gt;{{cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|year=2001|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-043076-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically prevalent forms of government include monarchy, [[aristocracy]], [[timocracy]], [[oligarchy]], [[democracy]], [[theocracy]] and [[Tyrant|tyranny]]. The main aspect of any philosophy of government is how political power is obtained, with the two main forms being [[election|electoral contest]] and [[hereditary succession]].

==Definitions and etymology==

A government is the [[system]] to [[Governance|govern]] a [[state (polity)|state]] or community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=government|publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]]|date=2010|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''government'' derives, ultimately, from the Greek verb κυβερνάω [''kubernáo''] (meaning ''to steer'' with [[Gubernaculum (classical)|gubernaculum]] (rudder), the metaphorical sense being attested in [[Plato]]'s [[Ship of State]]).&lt;ref name="britannica1911"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information|year=1911|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Columbia Encyclopedia defines government as "a system of social control under which the right to make laws, and the right to enforce them, is vested in a particular group in society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Columbia University Press | title=Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th edition |year=2000| title-link=Columbia Encyclopedia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While all types of organizations have governance, the word ''government'' is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 [[List of sovereign states|independent national governments]] on [[Earth]], as well as their subsidiary organizations.&lt;ref name=EncycSocialSciences&gt;{{cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|year=2001|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-043076-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the word ''government'' is also used more narrowly to refer to the [[ministry (collective executive)]], a collective group of people that exercises [[executive (government)|executive authority]] in a state{{cn|date=September 2017}} or, metonymically, to the governing [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] as part of the executive.

Finally, ''government'' is also sometimes used in English as a [[synonym]] for [[governance]].

==History==
{{main|Political history of the world|Political philosophy}}

The moment and place that the phenomenon of human government developed is lost in time; however, history does record the formations of early governments. About 5,000 years ago, the first small city-states appeared.{{sfn|Christian|2004|p=245}} By the third to second millenniums BC, some of these had developed into larger governed areas: [[Sumer]], [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], and the [[List of Neolithic cultures of China|Yellow River Civilization]].{{sfn|Christian|2004|p=294}}

The development of [[agriculture]] and [[water control]] projects were a catalyst for the development of governments.&lt;ref name="brittanica2010"&gt;The New Encyclopædia Britannica (15th edition)&lt;/ref&gt; For many thousands of years when people were [[hunter-gatherer]]s and small scale farmers, humans lived in small, non-hierarchical and [[self-sufficient]] communities.{{cn|date=October 2017}} On occasion a chief of a tribe was elected by various rituals or tests of strength to govern his tribe, sometimes with a group of elder tribesmen as a council. The human ability to precisely communicate abstract, learned information allowed humans to become ever more effective at agriculture,{{sfn|Christian|2004|pp=146–147}} and that allowed for ever increasing population densities.{{sfn|Christian|2004|p=245}} David Christian explains how this resulted in states with laws and governments:&lt;ref name="Christian"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|As farming populations gathered in larger and denser communities, interactions between different groups increased and the social pressure rose until, in a striking parallel with star formation, new structures suddenly appeared, together with a new level of complexity. Like stars, cities and states reorganize and energize the smaller objects within their gravitational field.|David Christian, p. 245|&lt;u&gt;Maps of Time&lt;/u&gt;}}

Starting at the end of the [[17th century]], the prevalence of [[republic|republican forms]] of government grew. The [[Glorious Revolution]] in England, the [[American Revolution]], and the [[French Revolution]] contributed to the growth of representative forms of government. The [[Soviet Union]] was the first large country to have a [[Communist]] government.&lt;ref name=EncycSocialSciences /&gt; Since the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], [[liberal democracy]] has become an even more prevalent form of government.&lt;ref name="Kuper" /&gt;

In the nineteenth and twentieth century, there was a significant increase in the size and scale of government at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|isbn=978-0-19-957967-9|title=The Oxford Handbook of State and Local Government|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included the regulation of [[corporations]] and the development of the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref name="Kuper"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Social Science Encyclopedia|editor=Adam Kuper and Jessica Kuper|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-47635-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political science==
=== Classifying government ===
In political science, it has long been a goal to create a typology or taxonomy of [[polities]], as typologies of political systems are not obvious.&lt;ref&gt;Lewellen, Ted C. ''Political Anthropology: An Introduction Third Edition''. Praeger Publishers; 3rd edition (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially important in the [[political science]] fields of [[comparative politics]] and [[international relations]]. Like all categories discerned within forms of government, the boundaries of government classifications are either fluid or ill-defined.

Superficially, all governments have an official or ideal form. The United States is a [[Federal republic|constitutional republic]], while the former Soviet Union was a [[socialist republic]]. However self-identification is not objective, and as Kopstein and Lichbach argue, defining regimes can be tricky.&lt;ref&gt;''Comparative politics : interests, identities, and institutions in a changing global order'', Jeffrey Kopstein, Mark Lichbach (eds.), 2nd ed, Cambridge University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0521708400}}, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[election]]s are a defining characteristic of an electoral democracy,{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} but in practice elections in the former Soviet Union were not "free and fair" and took place in a [[one-party state]]. [[Voltaire]] argued that "the [[Holy Roman Empire]] is neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Holy Roman Empire was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire | journal=Michigan Academician | last1=Renna | first1=Thomas | volume=42 | issue=1 | pages=60–75 | doi=10.7245/0026-2005-42.1.60 | date=Sep 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many governments that officially call themselves a "[[democratic republic]]" are not democratic, nor a republic; they are usually a dictatorship ''[[de facto]]''. Communist dictatorships have been especially prone to use this term. For example, the official name of North Vietnam was "The Democratic Republic of Vietnam". China uses a variant, "The People's Republic of China". Thus in many practical classifications it would not be considered democratic.

Identifying a form of government is also difficult because many [[political systems]] originate as socio-economic movements and are then carried into governments by [[political party|parties]] naming themselves after those movements; all with competing political-ideologies. Experience with those movements in power, and the strong ties they may have to particular forms of government, can cause them to be considered as forms of government in themselves.

Other complications include general non-consensus or deliberate "distortion or bias" of reasonable technical definitions to political ideologies and associated forms of governing, due to the nature of politics in the modern era. For example: The meaning of "[[conservatism]]" in the [[United States]] has little in common with the way the word's definition is used elsewhere. As Ribuffo notes, "what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls [[liberalism]] or neoliberalism".&lt;ref&gt;Leo P. Ribuffo, "20 Suggestions for Studying the Right now that Studying the Right is Trendy," ''Historically Speaking'' Jan 2011 v.12#1 pp. 2–6, quote on p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s conservatism in the United States has been chiefly associated with the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. However, during the era of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] many [[Southern Democrats]] were conservatives, and they played a key role in the [[Conservative Coalition]] that controlled Congress from 1937 to 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Kari Frederickson, ''The Dixiecrat Revolt and the End of the Solid South, 1932–1968'', p. 12, "...conservative southern Democrats viewed warily the potential of New Deal programs to threaten the region's economic dependence on cheap labor while stirring the democratic ambitions of the disfranchised and undermining white supremacy.", The University of North Carolina Press, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-8078-4910-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social-political ambiguity===
Every country in the world is ruled by a system of governance that combines at least three or more political or economic attributes.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Additionally, opinions vary by individuals concerning the types and properties of governments that exist. "Shades of gray" are commonplace in any government and its corresponding classification. Even the most liberal democracies limit rival political activity to one extent or another while the most tyrannical dictatorships must organize a broad base of support thereby creating difficulties for "[[pigeonholing]]" governments into narrow categories. Examples include the claims of the [[Plutocracy#United States|United States as being a plutocracy]] rather than a democracy since some American voters believe elections are being manipulated by wealthy [[Super PACs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781594204098,00.html "Plutocrats – The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407045309/http://www.us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781594204098,00.html |date=7 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The dialectical forms of government ===
{{Main article|Plato's five regimes}}
The [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Plato]] discusses five types of regimes: [[aristocracy]], [[timocracy]], [[oligarchy]], [[democracy]] and [[Tyrant|tyranny]]. Plato also assigns a man to each of these regimes to illustrate what they stand for. The tyrannical man would represent tyranny for example. These five regimes progressively degenerate starting with aristocracy at the top and tyranny at the bottom.

==Forms of government==
{{main list|List of forms of government}}

One method of classifying governments is through which people have the authority to rule.  This can either be one person (an autocracy, such as monarchy), a select group of people (an aristocracy), or the people as a whole (a democracy, such as a republic).

The division of governments as monarchy, aristocracy and democracy has been used since Aristotle's [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}  In his book [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] expands on this classification.

{{quote|The difference of Commonwealths consisteth in the difference of the sovereign, or the person representative of all and every one of the multitude. And because the sovereignty is either in one man, or in an assembly of more than one; and into that assembly either every man hath right to enter, or not every one, but certain men distinguished from the rest; it is manifest there can be but three kinds of Commonwealth. For the representative must needs be one man, or more; and if more, then it is the assembly of all, or but of a part. When the representative is one man, then is the Commonwealth a monarchy; when an assembly of all that will come together, then it is a democracy, or popular Commonwealth; when an assembly of a part only, then it is called an aristocracy. Other kind of Commonwealth there can be none: for either one, or more, or all, must have the sovereign power (which I have shown to be indivisible) entire.&lt;ref name="Leviathan"&gt;{{cite wikisource|author=Hobbes, Thomas|title=Leviathan|wslink=Leviathan/The Second Part}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Autocracy===
An autocracy is a system of government in which supreme [[Power (social and political)|power]] is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of a [[coup d'état]] or mass [[insurrection]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/autocracy |title=Autocracy: A Glossary of Political Economy Terms|author=Paul M. Johnson |publisher=Auburn.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[despotism]] is a government ruled by a single entity with absolute power, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regular mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for implicit threat). That entity may be an individual, as in an [[autocracy]], or it may be a group, as in an [[oligarchy]]. The word despotism means to "rule in the fashion of despots".{{cn|date=November 2017}}

A [[monarchy]] is where a family or group of families (rarely another type of group), called the [[wikt:Special:Search/royalty|royalty]], represents national identity, with power traditionally assigned to one of its individuals, called the monarch, who mostly rule kingdoms. The actual role of the monarch and other members of royalty varies from purely symbolical ([[crowned republic]]) to partial and restricted ([[constitutional monarchy]]) to completely despotic ([[absolute monarchy]]). Traditionally and in most cases, the post of the monarch is [[inheritance|inherited]], but there are also [[elective monarchy|elective monarchies]] where the monarch is elected.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

===Aristocracy===
Aristocracy ([[Greek language|Greek]] ἀριστοκρατία ''aristokratía'', from  ἄριστος ''[[Wikt:aristocrat#English|aristos]]'' "excellent", and κράτος ''[[Wikt:kratos|kratos]]'' "[[Power (social and political)|power]]") is a form of government that places power in the hands of a small, privileged [[ruling class]].&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |authorlink= |date=December 1989 |title=Aristocracy |trans_title= |journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50011987?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=aristocracy&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 |accessdate=December 22, 2009 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629022358/http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50011987?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=aristocracy&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 |archivedate=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Monarchy|monarchies]] were aristocracies, although in modern constitutional monarchies the monarch himself or herself has little real power. The term "Aristocracy" could also refer to the non-peasant, non-servant, and non-city classes in the [[Feudalism|Feudal system]].   

An oligarchy is ruled by a small group of segregated, powerful or influential people who usually share similar interests or family relations. These people may spread power and elect candidates equally or not equally. An oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things. An oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or monarchic. An oligarchy does not have one clear ruler but several rulers.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Some historical examples of oligarchy are the former [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republic]]s. Some critics of [[representative democracy]] think of [[Oligarchy#United States|the United States as an oligarchy]]. The [[Athenian democracy]] used [[sortition]] to elect candidates, almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of land, wealth and status.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

A [[theocracy]] is rule by a religious elite; a system of governance composed of religious institutions in which the state and the church are traditionally or [[constitution]]ally the same entity.  [[Holy See|The Vatican]]'s (see [[Pope]]), [[Iran]]'s (see [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]]), [[Central Tibetan Administration|Tibetan government]]'s (see [[Dalai Lama]]), [[Caliphate]]s and other [[Islamic state]]s are historically considered ''theocracies''.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

===Democracy===
In a general sense, in a [[democracy]], all the people of a [[state (polity)|state]] or [[polity]] are involved in making decisions about its affairs. Also refer to the rule by a government chosen by election where most of the populace are enfranchised. The key distinction between a democracy and other forms of constitutional government is usually taken to be that the right to vote is not limited by a person's wealth or race (the main qualification for enfranchisement is usually having reached a certain age). A democratic government is, therefore, one supported (at least at the time of the election) by a [[majority]] of the populace (provided the election was held fairly). A "majority" may be defined in different ways. There are many "power-sharing" (usually in countries where people mainly identify themselves by race or religion) or "electoral-college" or "constituency" systems where the government is not chosen by a simple one-vote-per-person headcount.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In democracies, large proportions of the population may vote, either to make decisions or to choose representatives to make decisions. Commonly significant in democracies are political parties, which are groups of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed. Different political parties have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

[[Liberal democracy]] is a variant of democracy. It is a [[form of government]] in which [[representative democracy]] operates under the principles of [[liberalism]]. It is characterised by fair, free, and competitive [[election]]s between [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|multiple distinct]] [[Political party|political parties]], a [[separation of powers]] into different [[branches of government]], the [[rule of law]] in everyday life as part of an [[open society]], and the protection of [[human rights]] and [[civil liberties]] for all persons. To define the system in practice, liberal democracies often draw upon a [[constitution]], either formally written or [[Uncodified constitution|uncodified]], to delineate the powers of government and enshrine the [[social contract]]. After a period of sustained expansion throughout the 20th century, liberal democracy became the predominant political system in the world. A liberal democracy may take various constitutional forms: it may be a [[republic]], such as [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], or the [[United States]]; or a [[constitutional monarchy]], such as [[Japan]], [[Spain]], or the [[United Kingdom]]. It may have a [[presidential system]] ([[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], or the [[United States]]), a [[semi-presidential system]] ([[France]], [[Portugal]], or [[Republic of China|Taiwan]]), or a [[parliamentary system]] ([[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[India]], [[Italy]], New Zealand, or the [[United Kingdom]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

=== Republics ===
A republic is a form of government in which the country is considered a "public matter" (Latin: ''res publica''), not the private concern or property of the rulers, and where offices of states are subsequently directly or indirectly elected or appointed rather than inherited.  The people, or some significant portion of them, have supreme control over the government and where offices of state are elected or chosen by elected people.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[[Montesquieu]], ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748), Bk. II, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Republic|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common simplified definition of a republic is a government where the head of state is not a monarch.&lt;ref name="WordNet"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=republic |journal=WordNet 3.0 |accessdate=20 March 2009 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M-W"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Republic|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/republic|accessdate=14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Montesquieu]] included both [[democracy|democracies]], where all the people have a share in rule, and [[aristocracy|aristocracies]] or [[oligarchy|oligarchies]], where only some of the people rule, as republican forms of government.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Montesquieu, ''Spirit of the Laws'', Bk. II, ch. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other terms used to describe different republics include [[Democratic republic]], [[Parliamentary republic]], [[Federal republic]], and [[Islamic Republic]].

== Scope of government ==
Rule by [[authoritarian]] governments is identified in societies where a specific set of people possess the authority of the state in a [[republic]] or union. It is a [[political system]] controlled by unelected rulers who usually permit some degree of [[individual freedom]]. Rule by a [[totalitarian]] government is characterised by a highly centralised and coercive authority that regulates nearly every aspect of public and private life.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In contrast, a constitutional republic is rule by a government whose powers are limited by law or a formal constitution, and chosen by a vote amongst at least some sections of the populace (Ancient Sparta was in its own terms a republic, though most inhabitants were disenfranchised). Republics that exclude sections of the populace from participation will typically claim to represent all citizens (by defining people without the vote as "non-citizens"). Examples include the [[United States]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], etc. {{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Federalism ===
{{Expand section|date=January 2013}}
Federalism is a political concept in which a ''group'' of members are bound together by covenant (Latin: ''foedus'', [[wikt:covenant|covenant]]) with a governing [[federal headship|representative head]]. The term "federalism" is also used to describe a system of government in which [[sovereignty]] is [[constitution]]ally divided between a central governing authority and constituent political units (such as states or provinces). Federalism is a system based upon democratic rules and institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and provincial/state governments, creating what is often called a [[federation]]. Proponents are often called [[federalist]]s.

== Economic systems ==
{{further|Economic system}}
Historically, most political systems originated as [[socioeconomic]] [[economic ideology|ideologies]]. Experience with those movements in power and the strong ties they may have to particular forms of government can cause them to be considered as forms of government in themselves.

| [[Feudalism]] || A social-economic system of land ownership and duties. Under feudalism, all the land in a kingdom was the king's. However, the king would give some of the land to the lords or nobles who fought for him. These presents of land were called manors. Then the nobles gave some of their land to vassals. The vassals then had to do duties for the nobles. The lands of vassals were called fiefs.

Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice (2006): "Virtually all (democratic) socialists have distanced themselves from the economic model long synonymous with 'socialism,' i.e. the Soviet model of a non-market, centrally-planned economy...Some have endorsed the concept of 'market socialism,' a post-capitalist economy that retains market competition, but socializes the means of production, and, in some versions, extends democracy to the workplace. Some hold out for a non-market, participatory economy.

| [[Statism]] || A social-economic system that concentrates power in the state at the expense of individual freedom. Among other variants, the term subsumes theocracy, absolute monarchy, Nazism, fascism, authoritarian socialism, and plain, unadorned dictatorship. Such variants differ on matters of form, tactics and ideology.
|-
| [[Welfare state]] || A social-economic system in which the state plays a key role in the protection and promotion of the economic and social well-being of its citizens. It is based on the principles of [[equality of opportunity]], equitable [[distribution of wealth]], and public responsibility for those unable to avail themselves of the minimal provisions for a good life.

'''Historically significant lunar eclipses''' are [[Lunar eclipse|eclipses of the Moon]] that are mentioned in historical accounts in connection with a significant event. Lunar eclipses are somewhat rare events, although not as rare as solar eclipses, because unlike solar eclipses they can be viewed from anywhere on the dark side of the Earth. Throughout history lunar eclipses have been held to be responsible for lost battles, and have helped make possible extraordinary escapes.

==29 January 1137 BC==
{{See|List of 12th-century BCE lunar eclipses}}
The first mention of a lunar eclipse was found in the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] book Zhou-Shu, a book of the [[Zhou Dynasty]]. The book was discovered in 280 AD, in a [[tomb]] of a king or noblemen. The eclipse mentioned in this book took place many centuries before that time. Professor S.M. Russell believes that the eclipse described in the book may refer to the event that happened on 29 January 1137 BC (-1136).&lt;ref name="The Observatory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEcat5/LE-1199--1100.html|title=Catalog of Lunar Eclipses:  -1199 to  -1100|website=Eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==9 October 425 BC==
{{See|List of 5th-century BCE lunar eclipses}}
When eclipses were not well understood, they were sometimes associated with unnatural forces. [[Witch]]es from the Greek region of [[Thessaly]] claimed the ability to extinguish the moon's light and draw it down from the sky. In his famous comedy ''[[The Clouds]]'' (419 BC), [[Aristophanes]] describes the eclipse that took place two years prior to that.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;
{{cquote|the moon deserted her course and the sun at once veiled his beam threatening, no longer to give you light, if Cleon became general...&lt;ref name="The clouds"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEcat5/LE-0499--0400.html|title=Catalog of Lunar Eclipses:  -0499 to  -0400|website=Eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==28 August 413 BC==
{{See|List of 5th-century BCE lunar eclipses}}
This eclipse happened during [[Sicilian Expedition#Second Battle of Syracuse|Second Battle of Syracuse]]. Just as the Athenians were preparing to sail home, there was a [[lunar eclipse]], and [[Nicias]], described by [[Thucydides]] as a particularly superstitious man, asked the priests what he should do. The priests suggested the Athenians wait for another 27 days, and Nicias agreed. The Syracusans took advantage of this, and 76 of their ships attacked 86 Athenian ships in the harbor. The Athenians were defeated and [[Eurymedon (strategos)|Eurymedon]] was killed. Many of the ships were pushed up on to the shore, where [[Gylippus]] was waiting. He killed some of the crews and captured 18 beached ships, but a force of Athenians and Etruscans forced Gylippus back.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt; [[Plutarch]] described this eclipse and the superstitious response:

{{cquote|And when all were in readiness, and none of the enemy had observed them, not expecting such a thing, the moon was eclipsed in the night, to the great fright of Nicias and others, who, for want of experience, or out of superstition, felt alarm at such appearances.&lt;ref name="Plutarch"/&gt;}}

==22 May 1453==
{{See|List of 15th-century lunar eclipses}}
{{Main|May 1453 lunar eclipse}}
This partial lunar eclipse was seen during the [[Fall of Constantinople]] (the capture of the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]]), during the siege that lasted from Thursday, 5 April 1453 until Tuesday, 29 May 1453), after which the city fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. The lunar eclipse was considered to be fulfilling a prophecy for the city's demise. It is said a blood moon took place during the eclipse.

==1 March 1504==
{{See|List of 16th-century lunar eclipses}}
{{Main|March 1504 lunar eclipse}}
[[File:Eclipse Christophe Colomb.jpg|thumb|Illustration of Columbus using a lunar eclipse to impress the [[Indigenous people]] of Jamaica.&lt;BR&gt;From ''Astronomie Populaire'' 1879, p 231 fig. 86]]
On 30 June 1503, [[Christopher Columbus]] beached his two last [[caravel]]s and was stranded in [[Jamaica]]. The [[indigenous people]] of the island welcomed Columbus and his crew and fed them, but Columbus' sailors cheated and stole from the natives. After six months, the natives halted the food supply.&lt;ref name="Columbus" /&gt;

Columbus had on board an [[almanac]] authored by [[Regiomontanus]] of [[astronomical]] tables covering the years 1475–1506; upon consulting the book, he noticed the date and the time of an upcoming lunar eclipse. He was able to use this information to his advantage. He requested a meeting for that day with the [[Cacique]], the leader, and told him that his [[god]] was angry with the local people's treatment of Columbus and his men. Columbus said his god would provide a clear sign of his displeasure by making the rising full Moon appear "inflamed with wrath".

The lunar eclipse and the red moon appeared on schedule, and the indigenous people were impressed and frightened. The son of Columbus, Ferdinand, wrote that the people:

{{cquote|with great howling and lamentation came running from every direction to the ships laden with provisions, praying to the Admiral to intercede with his god on their behalf...}}

Columbus timed the eclipse with his [[hourglass]], and shortly before the totality ended after 48 minutes, he told the frightened indigenous people that they were going to be forgiven.&lt;ref name="Columbus"/&gt; When the moon started to reappear from the shadow of the Earth, he told them that his god had pardoned them.&lt;ref name="space"/&gt;

=== Fictionalized variations===
In 1885 [[H. Rider Haggard]] used an altered version of the real story of the rescue of Columbus in his novel, ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]''. In that novel, [[Allan Quatermain]] and his fellow Englishmen use their foreknowledge of a solar eclipse to claim that they will black out the sun as proof of their powers, and save captive girls from an unjust death sentence.

In 1889 [[Mark Twain]] used a similar plot device in his novel, ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]''. In that novel, Hank Morgan, a 19th-century resident of [[Hartford, Connecticut]], after a blow to the head, awakens to find himself inexplicably transported back in time to [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|early medieval England]] at the time of the legendary [[King Arthur]]. When Morgan is about to be burned at the stake, he pretends to conjure a [[solar eclipse]] that he knew was about to happen; this prediction saves Morgan's life.&lt;ref name="space"/&gt;

Another novel that used a solar-eclipse scene modeled after Columbus' lunar eclipse was [[Bolesław Prus]]' historical novel, ''[[Pharaoh (novel)#Inspirations|Pharaoh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Prus' ''Pharaoh'' and the Solar Eclipse", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', 1997, no. 4, pp. 471-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar plot also features in ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comic ''[[Prisoners of the Sun]]''.

==15 July 1916==
{{See|List of 20th-century lunar eclipses}}
{{Main article|July 1916 lunar eclipse}}
[[File:Lunar eclipse path July 15 1916 1.jpg|The path of the [[July 1916 lunar eclipse|lunar eclipse on 15 July 1916]]|thumb|200px]]
The [[Ross Sea party]] was a component of [[Ernest Shackleton|Sir Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] of 1914–17. Five men were stranded not far away from [[Cape Evans]]. There was [[sea ice]] between them and the relative safety of the hut on Cape Evans. On 8 May two of the men, [[Aeneas Mackintosh]] and [[Victor Hayward]], decided to make an attempt to reach the hut. Soon after they set out a [[blizzard]] hit. When the weather cleared up, the remaining men tried to look for them, but realized that the ice was far too thin to cross, and that their friends had been lost. Now they knew that they should wait for a thicker ice and for the full moon to attempt the crossing. Having the full moon was essential, because during [[polar night]] the Moon is the only source of natural light other than the extremely dim light of the stars.

The weather did not cooperate during the full moon of June, but on 15 July, everything seemed to be just right: calm weather, thick ice, clear skies and a full Moon. The men started their journey in the morning. When the Moon rose, however, the men were surprised to find it was about to be eclipsed. [[Ernest Wild]] wrote later: {{quote|text="I thought we were going to be left in darkness but a very little bit of the rim remained to light us..."}} 
Although the eclipse continued for few hours, the men were fortunate because it was only a partial eclipse. They reached Cape Evans later on the same day.&lt;ref name="Polar castaways"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4487">"'''How does one patch [[K Desktop Environment 2|KDE2]] under [[FreeBSD]]?'''" ({{lang-rus|«Как пропатчить KDE2 под FreeBSD?»|r=«Kak propatčitʹ KDE2 pod FreeBSD?»}}, {{IPA-ru|ˈkak prɐˈpat͡ʃitʲ ka dɛ ɛ ˈdva pɐt fri bi ɛs ˈdi|}}) is an [[internet meme]] in [[Internet in Russia|Russian Internet culture]].

The question was originally posted on the #[[anime]] channel of the [[RusNet]] [[IRC]] network on May 8, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irc.perm.ru/wwwlogs/anime.RusNet.2004.05.08.fragment.koi8-r.txt IRC log with the original phrase] {{Ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its text can be translated as follows:

:— Hello, is this an anime channel?
:— Yes.
:— How do I patch KDE2 under FreeBSD?

The phrase was meant to satirize the disproportionate amount of technical "geeky" conversations often occurring on that channel, having nothing to do with [[anime]]. Later it was popularized and became widely cited in [[Russophone]] chats.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-advocacy/2007-December/003442.html Post on the FreeBSD mailing list describing the phenomenon]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the phenomenon first received public attention when it was asked by many people prior to the July 6 online conference with the Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]].  Due to provoking campaigns, it became the third most popular question proposed to be asked during the conference, the first being "[[PREVED]], Vladimir Vladimirovich! How do you regard [[Bear surprise|MEDVED]]?"  However, the hosts did not ask him the question.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060824184842/http://president.yandex.ru/question.xml?id=194536 Original question for Vladimir Putin], 2006-07-03, [[Yandex]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, it was revived to be the number one most frequently asked question in a similar conference with the president of [[Kazakhstan]], [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]]. Nazarbayev answered the question seriously by describing the developments in the IT industry of Kazakhstan and the possible use of [[open-source software]] in it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSL0131903220070601 Kazakhs shower president with cryptic questions], 2007-06-01, [[Reuters]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, the question again became the most popular one preceding the Internet conference of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] President [[Viktor Yushchenko]]. He gave an answer, saying the programmers at his [[Secretariat of the President of Ukraine|secretariat]] are able to help patch KDE2 under different operating systems. He also recommended the adoption of newer software (a possible reference to the existence of [[KDE3]] at the time).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071230113609/http://president.pravda.com.ua/answers/4773d0049fef9/ Пане Президент, як пропатчити KDE2 під FreeBSD?] — Ukrainian conference log&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, an [[OpenBSD ports]] developer gave an overview at the [[Linux Vacation / Eastern Europe]] conference in [[Belarus]] on how to patch [[KDE4]] under OpenBSD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.openbsd.org/papers/lvee_2014_winter_kde4/ |title= How to patch KDE4 under OpenBSD |first= Vadim |last= Zhukov |publisher= [[OpenBSD]] |date= 2014-02-21 |accessdate= 2015-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ports.su/meta/kde4 |title= kde4-4.14.3 – KDE4 desktop meta-package (full installation) |work= [[OpenBSD ports]] |date= 2015-01-20 |accessdate= 2015-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reviving the long-lived meme once again under a new light.

The '''Leicester Comedy Festival''' is an annual comedy festival held in a number of venues across [[Leicester]], England early in the year.

== History==
The festival started in 1994 with 40 events in 23 venues over 7 days throughout [[Leicestershire]], attracting 5,000 people.  The festival now attracts over 60,000 people from all over the world and is seen as one of the 'Top 5 comedy festivals in the world' (The Guardian)

Since then many top [[stand-up comedians]] have performed in the festival including [[Jo Brand]], [[Jack Dee]], [[Dave Gorman]], [[Rory Bremner]], [[Simon Pegg]], [[Alan Davies]], [[Bill Bailey]], [[The Mighty Boosh]], [[Johnny Vegas]], [[Rich Hall]], [[Jimmy Carr]], [[Dara Ó Briain]], [[Russell Howard]], [[Dave Spikey]], [[Harry Hill]], [[Greg Davies]], [[Sarah Millican]] and [[Romesh Ranganathan]]. The main programme is also complemented by [[workshops]] and outdoor street events to encourage the development of comedy skills. Every year towards the end of the Festival the [[Leicester Mercury Comedian of the Year]] is announced.

===The UK Pun Championships===

2014 saw the inaugural UK Pun Championships, at the festival, hosted by [[Simon Brodkin|Lee Nelson]]. The winner was Darren Walsh. The competition included the line "My computer's got a Miley Virus. It's stopped twerking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mercury |first=Leicester |url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Comedy-Festival-Review-UK-Pun-Championships-Just/story-20629488-detail/story.html |title=Comedy Festival Review: The UK Pun Championships at Just The Tonic |publisher=Leicester Mercury |date=14 February 2014 |accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walsh went on to take part in the [[O. Henry Pun-Off|O. Henry Pun-Off World Championships]] in [[Austin, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy-festival.co.uk/newact/index.phpnewact.php?nav_id=96&amp;level=1 |title=Dave's Leicester Comedy Festival |publisher=Comedy-festival.co.uk |date=9 January 2015 |accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Leo Kearse beat off competition from fellow comedians Rob Thomas and reigning champion Darren Walsh to become the UK Pun Champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leokearse.co.uk/ |title=Leo Kearse |publisher=Leo Kearse |date= |accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leo won the contest with such jokes as ''"I was in hospital last week. I asked the nurse if I could do my own stitches. She said “suture self”'' and ''"Growing up on a farm, my dad was always telling me to use the indoor toilet. But I preferred to go against the grain"'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/news/is-it-punny-leo-kearse-wins-uk-pun-championship-2015-with-joke-about-stitches-10044804.html |title=2015 Pun Champs |publisher=Independent |date= |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2016 saw the return of the UK Pun Championships hosted again by [[Simon Brodkin|Lee Nelson]]. This year the winner was [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] comedian Masai Graham, with jokes such as ''"What's the difference between a hippo and a zippo? One's really heavy and the other is a little lighter"'' and ''"I love playing PGA Golf, but to say I have a weak shot on the greens would be putting it mildly"'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chortle.co.uk/review/2016/02/09/24136/the_uk_pun_championships_2016 |title=2016 Pun Champs |publisher=Chortle |date= |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 UK Pun Championships saw a new location in [[De Montfort Hall]] and host in [[Jason Byrne (comedian)|Jason Byrne]]. It also saw the introduction of a new layout for the show, with the "Pun Off's" taking place within a boxing ring that had been constructed within the centre of the stalls.  Lovdev Barpaga aka "The 'Pun'jabi Warrior'" won against Julian Lee in the final. Lovdevs jokes included ''"Pakistani Pirates. Urdu they think they argh?"'' and ''"I think my Colombian neighbour's a drug lord, but I just car tell."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/live/news/2442/lovdev_barpaga_pun_champion/ |title=2017 Pun Champs |publisher=Comedy.co.uk |date= |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 UK Pun Championships returned to [[De Montfort Hall]] in the boxing ring with host [[Jason Byrne (comedian)|Jason Byrne]] on the 13th of February. After being beaten in the 2015 by Leo Kearse, Rob Thomas returned and beat 2nd time finalist Julian Lee to the title. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/uk-pun-championships-meet-8-1200566 |title=2018 Pun Champs |publisher=Leicester Mercury |date= |accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Thomas' puns included: ''"When Leicester won the league, my mum bought a candle to celebrate. Now it just languishes in the middle of the table"'' and ''"Brexit. It's like a catheter for Britain. We're no longer in continent."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chortle.co.uk/features/2018/02/13/39128/the_best_%E2%80%93_and_the_worst_-_from_the_uk_pun_championship |title=The best – and the worst - from the UK Pun Championship |publisher=Chortle |date= |accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since early 1983, various companies in the Americas, Europe and Israel have published books based on the franchise.  In the United States, the Care Bears' books have been available through [[Random House]], [[Parker Brothers]] and [[Scholastic Books]].

==English-language books==

===Parker Brothers===
[[Parker Brothers]], a board game company then owned by [[General Mills]], launched its book publishing division in February 1983;&lt;ref name=miami&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KLslAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EfMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6961,2049534&amp;dq=care-bears&amp;hl=en|last=Dougherty|first=Philip H.|agency=[[The New York Times Company|New York Times News Service]]|title=Parker Bros. adding book publishing line|date=February 8, 1983|accessdate=August 9, 2010|work=[[The Miami News]]|page=8A}}&lt;/ref&gt; its first series consisted of six books featuring the Care Bears.&lt;ref name=miami/&gt;&lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{cite book| last = Wojahn| first = Ellen| title = Playing by Different Rules| year = 1988| publisher = American Management Association (amacom)| isbn = 0-8144-5861-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155–156}}  Various authors contributed to the resulting series, ''Tales from the Care Bears''; Tom Cooke illustrated most of the stories.  At the time of publication, various trade publications took note of Parker Brothers' unique marketing strategy for the books.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;{{rp|156}}  On October 30, 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0706430530/|title=Product information for ''Tales from the Care Bears''|accessdate=August 13, 2010|publisher=Amazon.com Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Great Britain's [[Hamlyn (publishers)|Octopus Books]] released a book under this title ({{ISBN|0-7064-3053-0}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/tales-from-the-care-bears/oclc/18325762|title=Catalog information for ''Tales from the Care Bears''|accessdate=August 13, 2010|work=WorldCat|publisher=Online Computer Library Center (OCLC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing Amelia Hubert's ''Sweet Dreams for Sally'' and Evelyn Mason's ''A Sister for Sam''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://copac.ac.uk/search?rn=1&amp;isn=0706430530|title=Catalog record for ''Tales from the Care Bears''|accessdate=August 13, 2010|location=[[University of Manchester]]|publisher=[[Copac]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker Brothers spent US$1 million in advertising on the original six-book series, which was made to promote the Care Bears characters.  According to a company spokesperson, the stories would demonstrate "love, caring, dreams, happiness, friendship, wishes, and feelings".  The series made its debut at the 1983 [[American International Toy Fair]], along with other Care Bears products.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;{{rp|155}}  John Keller, editorial director for the books, commented on their creation:

{{quote|The old way was to give authors their head. We, on the other hand, make up a list of, say, thirty interesting plot ideas, and then we do consumer testing ... Once I have the rankings, I call up my pool of authors and give them a plot to work with, and a style sheet explaining the characters. And then I say, "Please write 2,500 words filled with verve and excitement."&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;{{rp|155–156}}}}

===Random House===
In 1983, the U.S. publishing company [[Random House]] was granted paperback rights to books in the Care Bears franchise through American Greetings and General Mills, as Parker Brothers was unable to secure the exclusive publishing rights at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Business Week| url = https://books.google.com/?id=j58pAQAAIAAJ| accessdate = September 21, 2010| volume = Part 1| year = 1983| publisher = [[McGraw Hill]]| page = 98| quote = For example, because Parker has no track record in books, it was unable to obtain exclusive publishing rights to the Care Bears.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9631">'''Metatypy''' {{IPAc-en|m|ᵻ|ˈ|t|æ|t|ᵻ|p|i}} is a type of [[morphosyntactic]] and [[semantic]] [[language change]] brought about by [[language contact]] involving [[multilingual]] speakers. The term was coined by linguist [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]].

==Description==
Ross (1999: 7, 1) gives the following definition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Metatypy is a] ''change in morphosyntactic type and grammatical organisation'' [and also semantic patterns] ''which a language undergoes as a result of its speakers’ bilingualism in another language. This change is driven by grammatical [[calquing]], i.e. the copying of constructional meanings from the modified language and the innovation of new structures using inherited material to express them. A concomitant of this reorganisation of grammatical constructions is often the reorganisation or creation of paradigms of grammatical functors.... Usually, the language undergoing metatypy ('''the modified language''') is emblematic of its speakers’ identity, whilst the language which provides the '''metatypic model''' is an '''inter-community language'''. Speakers of the modified language form a sufficiently tightknit community to be well aware of their separate identity and of their language as a marker of that identity, but some bilingual speakers, at least, use the inter-community language so extensively that they are more at home in it than in the emblematic language of the community.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ross (2002) identifies the following metatypic changes:

# "reorganization of the language's semantic patterns and 'ways of saying things'"
# restructuring of its [[syntax]], the patterns of [[morpheme]]s being [[concatenate]]d to form
#* (i) sentences and clauses,
#* (ii) phrases
#* (iii) words

Ross finds that semantic reorganization occurs before syntactic restructuring. The syntactic changes occur in the order of (i) sentence/clause, (ii) phrase, and (iii) words.

Here are some languages that have undergone metatypy:

==Example==

The example given by Ross (1999) is the "Papuanisation" of the [[Takia language]] (of the Oceanic family, western branch) because of influence from the neighbouring [[Waskia language]] (of the [[Madang languages|Madang]] family, Trans–New Guinea). In Ross' terminology, Takia is the ''modified language'' and Waskia is the ''inter-community language''. Waskia, however, does not seem to have been significantly influenced by Takia. Both languages are spoken on [[Karkar Island]]. 

The end result of the metatypic change leaves Takia usually having a word-for-word Waskia translation such as the following:

:{| cellspacing="5"
! English transl.:
| colspan="4" | ''"the man is hitting me"''
|-
! Takia:
| tamol 
| an 
| ŋai 
| i-fun-ag=da
|-
| 
| man 
| &lt;small&gt;[[Determiner (linguistics)|DET]]&lt;/small&gt; 
| me 
| he-hit-me=&lt;small&gt;[[Imperfective aspect|IMP]]&lt;/small&gt;
|-
! Waskia:
| kadi 
| mu 
| aga 
| umo-so
|-
| 
| man 
| &lt;small&gt;DET&lt;/small&gt; 
| me 
| hit-&lt;small&gt;[[Present tense|PRES]]&lt;/small&gt;.he
|}

The pairing of syntactic and semantic structures makes this word-for-word translation possible. Some of the grammatical changes that Takia has undergone include the following:

:{| border="1" cellpadding="5" style="border-collapse: collapse; background: #f9f9f9; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; vertical-align: top; border: 1px solid #ccc; line-height: 1.2em;"
|- style="background: #efefef;"

! &amp;nbsp;
! Papuanised Takia
|-
! style="text-align: left; background: #efefef;" | [[word order]]:
| [[subject–verb–object|SVO]] 
| → 
| [[subject–object–verb|SOV]]
|-
! style="text-align: left; background: #efefef;" | non-[[deictic]] [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]: 
| precedes [[Head (linguistics)|head]] [[noun]] 
| →

|-
! style="text-align: left; background: #efefef;" | [[Adjective#Attributive use of nouns|attributive noun]]:

|-

| → 
| Noun Phrase + Noun Phrase + [[Postposition]]
|-
! style="text-align: left; background: #efefef;" | [[adposition]]:
| [[preposition]]
| →
| [[postposition]]
|}

The [[diffusion (linguistics)|diffusional]] changes of Takia are only in terms of metatypy: Takia has not altered its [[phonology]] and has virtually no [[loanword]]s borrowed from Waskia.

The '''New World Archaeological Foundation''' (NWAF) is an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] organization run by [[Brigham Young University]].

==History==
The NWAF was organized in 1952 for the purpose of supporting archaeological research into [[pre-Columbian]] cultures of [[Mesoamerica]].  It was founded by Thomas Stuart Ferguson, [[Alfred V. Kidder]] and [[Harvard University]] professor [[Gordon Willey]].  It was initially incorporated in California as a private organization with Ferguson in charge of fund-raising.  The first project by the NWAF was headed by [[Pedro Armillas]] with archaeological studies along the [[Grijalva River]].&lt;ref&gt;Peterson (2004), p.225&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1953, the NWAF received funding from [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] after Ferguson approached church leaders. LDS apostle [[John Widtsoe]] served on the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larson|first1=Stan|title=Quest for the Gold Plates: Thomas Stuart Ferguson's Archaeological Search for the Book of Mormon|publisher=Free Thinker Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferguson had a passion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wade|first=Lizzie|date=2018-01-18|title=How a Mormon lawyer transformed archaeology in Mexico—and ended up losing his faith|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/01/how-mormon-lawyer-transformed-archaeology-mexico-and-ended-losing-his-faith|journal=Science|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1126/science.aat0244|issn=0036-8075|accessdate=2018-01-20|quote="I am of the personal opinion that the Lord inspired [radiocarbon dating] that it might be used effectively in connection with the Book of Mormon."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for looking for archaeological evidences for the [[Book of Mormon]] and he reminded the church leadership that discovering Book of Mormon artifacts would assist in the church's missionary program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larson|first1=Stan|title=The Odyssey of Thomas Stuart Ferguson|journal=Dialogue Journal|volume=20|url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V23N01_57.pdf|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

NWAF has always remained an archaeological foundation that includes many people not members of the LDS church. Initially the only Latter-day Saint on the Foundation's advisory committee of five was [[M. Wells Jakeman]].  It also included Kidder, Willey, Armillas and [[Gordon F. Eckholm]].&lt;ref&gt;Peterson (2004), pp.231–232&lt;/ref&gt;

The NWAF became part of BYU in 1961 and Ferguson was removed from the director position and [[Howard W. Hunter]] was put in his place. Hunter was affiliated with NWAF for the next 24 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/ensign/1995/04/president-howard-w-hunter-the-lords-good-and-faithful-servant|accessdate=31 March 2016|title=President Howard W. Hunter: - ensign}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation has since been heavily involved with archaeological studies at such locations as [[Izapa]], [[San Isidro (Chiapas)|San Isidro]], [[El Mirador]], [[Paso de la Amada]], and most recently again at [[Chiapa de Corzo (Mesoamerican site)|Chiapa de Corzo]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

As of 2009 the NWAF was directed by [[Donald W. Forsyth]], Professor of Anthropology at Brigham Young University.  He succeeded [[John E. Clark]] who was the director for many years.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

'''Néstor García Canclini''' (born 1939)  is an Argentine-born academic and anthropologist known for his theorization of the concept of "hybridity."

== Biography  ==
García Canclini was born December 1, 1939 in [[La Plata]], Argentina. Three years after receiving his PhD in philosophy at the [[National University of La Plata|University of La Plata]] in 1975, thanks to a scholarship awarded from [[National Scientific and Technical Research Council|CONICET]] (The National Scientific and Technical Research Council), García Canclini also received another PhD in philosophy from the [[Paris Nanterre University]]. He taught at the University of La Plata between 1966 and 1975 and at the [[University of Buenos Aires]] in 1974 and 1975. Throughout his academic career he has also served as a visiting professor at [[University of Naples Federico II|University of Naples]], [[University of Texas at Austin|UT Austin]], [[Stanford University]], [[University of Barcelona]] and [[University of São Paulo|São Paulo]]. Since 1990 García Canclini has been working as a professor and researcher at the [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana]] in [[Mexico City]] and until 2007 he directed the university’s program studies on urban culture. He is also a researcher emeritus of the National System of Investigators under the [[National Council of Science and Technology]] (Conacyt) of Mexico.

==Lines of Investigation==
In the text ''Comunicación y consumo en tiempos neoconservadores'' (Communication and Consumerism in Neoconservative Times), the theorist affirms that communications research, centered in the social sciences, has made areas of Latin American cultural development visible, in which the relationship between consumerism and citizenship is established. Consumerism, a product of globalization, has generated a new conception of the citizen, while the quantity of goods that a person can acquire determines the social status that they have and therefore the role of the common citizen, in terms of political participation (mainly) depends on how the consumer is.

The principal cause of the aforementioned phenomenon is globalization. For Canclini, this concept does not have its own definition, rather, it depends on the circumstances and the contexts which are presented. In the Latin American case, globalization is not a perceptible fact, instead an imagined concept, that is to say, it constitutes a paradigm in Latin American society that governs the relations between different individuals (there is a notion that it “exists,” but in reality it is the product of a series of values that Latin American society has imposed upon itself to resemble the first world).

The previous can be seen reflected in the critique of marketing studies that only counts the economic figures of Latin America’s entry into world trade, but do not take into account the symbolic-social change that this generates, in his book ''La globalización imaginada'' (The Imagined Globalization), chapter ‘Mercado e Interculturalidad: América Latina entre Europa y Estados Unidos’ (Market and Interculturality: Latin America between Europe and the United States). In respect to the last main idea of the investigation, Canclini suggests that the Latin American cultural space and transitional circuits are immersed in imagined constructions about the identity of us and of others; the Latin American elite constructs the city in resemblance to the great European and American metropolises, while the rest of the town seeks to survive with its traditions in the modernizing process.&lt;blockquote&gt;"La industria cultural es analizada como matriz de desorganización y reorganización de una experiencia temporal mucho más compatible con las desterritorializaciones y relocalizaciones que implican las migraciones sociales y las fragmentaciones culturales de la vida urbana que la que configuran la cultura de élite o la cultura popular, ambas ligadas a una temporalidad “moderna”; esto es, una experiencia hecha de sedimentaciones, acumulaciones e innovaciones. Industria cultural y comunicaciones masivas designan los nuevos procesos de producción y circulación de la cultura, que corresponden no sólo a innovaciones tecnológicas sino a nuevas formas de la sensibilidad, a nuevos tipos de recepción, de disfrute y apropiación."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;English Translation:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The cultural industry is analyzed like a matrix of disorganization and reorganization of a temporary experience much more compatible with the deterritorializations and relocations that imply social migrations and cultural fragmentations of urban life that configure the elite culture and popular culture, both bound to a temporary “modernity,” this is, an experience made of sedimentations, accumulations and innovations. Cultural industry and massive communications design new processes of production and circulation of culture, that correspond not only to technological innovations but also new forms of sensibility, new forms of reception, of enjoyment and appropriation. &lt;/blockquote&gt;In the book ''Lectores, espectadores e internautas'' (Readers, Spectators, and Internet Users), Canclini asks us: What does it mean to be a reader, spectator, and internet user? What are the cultural habits of a person that concurs in these three activities? Canclini speaks of the reader in two sentiments, the first making reference to the literary field like [[Hans Robert Jauss]] and the second through the editorial system like [[Umberto Eco]] does. Canclini accuses the system of wanting to generate new readers only through printed media, without taking into account digital media. The concept of the spectator is linked to the types of shows that they attend, cinema, television, recitals etc. And the internet-user is "un actor multimodal que lee, ve, escucha y combina materiales diversos, procedentes de la lectura y de los espectáculos" (a multimodal actor that reads, sees, listens, and combines diverse materials, from readings and entertainment).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infoamerica.org/teoria/garcia_canclini1.htm|title=INFOAMÉRICA {{!}} Néstor García Canclini|website=www.infoamerica.org|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book develops in the form of a dictionary, starting with A for ‘apertura’(aperture) and the Z for zipping. He describes new concepts that have brought the digital age. The reader - spectator - and internet user read more on the internet than on paper. This book shows us both the benefits of technology and its negative aspects that are familiar to us all.

=== Overview ===
Canclini has been one of the principal anthropologists that has treated [[Modernity]], [[Postmodernity]], and [[Culture]] from the Latin American perspective. One of the principal terms he has coined is “cultural hybridization,” a phenomenon that “materializes in multi-determined scenarios where diverse systems intersect and interpenetrate.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Consumidores y ciudadanos: Conflictos multiculturales de la globalización|last=García Canclini|first=Néstor|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=|location=Mexico: Grijalbo|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is contemporary music groups that mix or juxtapose global trends such as [[Pop music|pop]] with indigenous or traditional rhythms. One of his best-known works, ''Consumidores y ciudadanos'' (Consumers and Citizens) defines consumption as "the set of socio-cultural processes in which the appropriation and uses of products are carried out."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Hybrid Cultures: Strategies for Entering and Leaving Modernity ===
This text is foundational to Latin American [[Cultural studies|Cultural Studies]] and is now considered a classic. Canclini takes an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] approach to social thought to critically reimagine Latin American issues pertaining to modernity and [[democracy]], &lt;blockquote&gt;"Néstor García Canclini explores the tensions, verging on contradictions, between modernization and democratization in Latin American nation-states. These states regard themselves caught between traditions that have not yet gone and a modernity that has not yet arrived. From its hybrid position between tradition and modernity, the challenge for Latin America is to construct democratic culture and knowledge without succumbing either to the temptations of elite art and literature or to the coercive forces of mass media and marketing. In a work of committed scholarship the author both interrogates and advocates the development of democratic institutions and practices in Latin America."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rosaldo, R. (1995). Foreword. In CANCLINI N., Chiappari C., &amp; López S. (Authors), Hybrid Cultures: Strategies for Entering and Leaving Modernity (pp. Xi-Xviii). University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Canclini analyzes and synthesizes the theories of [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]], [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramsci]], [[Max Weber|Weber]], elite literary works and [[popular culture]] to envision a Latin American [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] that celebrates hybridization “as an ongoing condition of all human cultures, which contains no zones of purity because they undergo continuous processes of transculturation (two-way borrowing and lending between cultures)."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thereby imagined cultural borders are actually very porous.

== Biography ==
Olga Freidenberg was born to Anna Osipovna Pasternak and Mikhail Filippovich Freidenberg in [[Odessa]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The family moved to [[Saint Petersburg|St Petersburg]] in 1903 and Freidenberg graduated from a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] there in 1908. Restricted in her ability to pursue university education as a woman and a Jew, she travelled through Europe studying foreign languages on her own and living in [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], [[Italy]], and [[Switzerland]]. As World War I broke out, she returned to Russia and became a military nurse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Freidenberg returned to her studies at [[Saint Petersburg State University#1821–present|Petrograd University]] in 1923 and wrote a Ph.D. thesis in 1924, titled ''The Origins of the'' ''Greek Novel''. The University had only started accepting women as students in 1917, and Friedenberg was the first woman to defend her thesis in [[Classics#Philology|classical philology]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1935 she was awarded the Russian highest scientific degree of Doctor of Science. Since all of the Classics Departments in Russia had been shut since 1921, Freidenberg played a key role in founding the new Classical Department at [[Petrograd University]]. Freidenberg also founded the chair of classical philology and was head of the Classical Department from 1932–1950.

In her work, Freidenberg drew comparison between pagan erotic novels and both [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] (Apocryphal and Canonical) and [[Gospels of Christ|Gospels]]. She defined a narrative genre of ‘Acts and Passions’ of a hero as their common basis. Freidenberg was the first in Europe to conclude that the ‘Greek’ novel was Oriental in its origin. She noted that the archetypal patterns in the plots of its different narratives were versions of the ''legomenon'' which can be traced back to the ''dromenon'' of fertility cults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braginskaia|first=Nina V.|date=2003-12-01|title=From the Marginals to the Center: Olga Freidenberg's Works on the Greek Novel|url=https://rjh.ub.rug.nl/AN/article/view/24301|journal=Ancient Narrative|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=64–85|issn=1568-3532}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.versopolis.com/long-read/454/three-women-on-love-during-war-anica-savi-rebac-olga-freidenberg-edith-stein|title=Versopolis {{!}} Three Women on Love during War: Anica Savić Rebac, Olga Freidenberg, Edith Stein|last=Beletrina|first=Production:|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–1953)|Stalin era]] she was persecuted and her brother was arrested. In 1950, as part of the [[Rootless cosmopolitan|persecution of "rootless cosmopolitans"]] she was fired from [[Saint Petersburg State University#1821–present|Petrograd University]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, Freidenberg's 1935 dissertation ''The Poetics of Plot and Genre: The Classical Period of Ancient Literature'' was the only book published in her lifetime (in 1936) but was denounced by the Soviet authorities and taken out of circulation shortly afterwards. It was republished in 1997.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Many of Freidenberg's works were not published in her lifetime and some still remain unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://coseelis.wordpress.com/2015/08/20/olga-freidenbergs-online-archive/|title=Olga Freidenberg’s online archive|date=2015-08-20|work=COSEELIS - Council for Slavonic and East European Library and Information Services|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars, such as Nina Perlina and Nina Braginskaya, are now publishing new editions of Freidenberg's works in English.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fusso|first=Susanne|date=1999|title=Review: Olga Freidenberg, Image and Concept: Mythopoetic Roots of Literature, ed.

Her main interest in math was in the field of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]].

In 1912 she married [[Otto Neurath]] whom she met during her studies. Olga became a regular participant in the Vienna Circle discussions. Following the defeat of [[Red Vienna]] in the [[Austrian Civil War]] (February 1934), she fled, through [[Poland]] and [[Denmark]] to the [[Netherlands]], where she joined her husband. She died on her birthday three years later in [[The Hague]], following an operation.

The '''''Patrologia Orientalis''''' is an attempt to create a comprehensive collection of the writings by eastern [[Church Fathers]] in [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], and [[Slavonic language|Slavonic]]. It is designed to complement the comprehensive, influential, and monumental [[Patrologia Latina|Latin]] and [[Patrologia Graeca|Greek patrologies]] published in the 19th century. It began in 1897 as the ''[[Patrologia]] Syriaca'',  was discontinued in its original form and replaced by the ''[[Patrologia]] Orientalis''. The collection began with those [[liturgical]] texts that touch on [[hagiography]]. Since then critical editions of the [[Bible]], theological works, [[homilies]] and letters have been published.

The edition is ongoing. Editors were René Graffin, (d. 1941); François Nau (d. 1931); [[Prince Maximilian of Saxony (1870–1951)|Max]], [[Prince]] of [[Saxony]] (d. 1951) and from 1951 François Graffin. Volume 1 was published in 1904, and 1984 saw the publication of volume 41.

== Etymology ==
There are many hypotheses about the etymology of the name ''Paul Bunyan''. Much of the commentary focuses on a [[French-Canadian language|Franco-Canadian]] origin for the name. Phonetically Bunyan is similar to the [[Québécois French|Québécois]] expression "''bon yenne!''" expressing surprise or astonishment. The English surname Bunyan is derived from the same root as bunion in the [[Old French]] ''bugne'', referring to a large lump or swelling. Several researchers have attempted to trace Paul Bunyan to the character of [[Bon Jean]] of French Canadian folklore.&lt;ref name="gartenberg"&gt;{{Citation

Michael Edmonds states in his 2009 book ''Out of the Northwoods: The Many Lives of Paul Bunyan'' that Paul Bunyan stories circulated for at least thirty years before finding their way into print. In contrast to the lengthy narratives abundant in published material, Paul Bunyan "stories" when told in the lumbercamp [[bunkhouse]]s were presented in short fragments.&lt;ref name="edmonds" /&gt; Some of these stories include motifs from older folktales, such as absurdly severe weather and [[fearsome critters]].&lt;ref name="cox"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.fearsomecreaturesofthelumberwoods.com/mainindex.htm |last1=Cox |first1=William T. |others=With illustrations by Coert Du Bois and Latin classifications by George B.

The earliest recorded reference to Paul Bunyan is an uncredited 1904 editorial in the ''[[Duluth News Tribune]]'' which recounts:

{{Pull quote|His pet joke and the one with which the green horn at the camp is sure to be tried, consists of a series of imaginative tales about the year Paul Bunyan lumbered in [[North Dakota]]. The great Paul is represented as getting out countless millions of timber in the year of the "blue snow." The men's shanty in his camp covered a half section, and the mess camp was a stupendous affair. The range on which an army of cookees prepared the beans and "red horse" was so long that when the cook wanted to grease it up for the purpose of baking the wheat cakes in the morning, they strapped two large hams to his feet and started him running up and down a half mile of black glistening stove top.&lt;ref name=duluth&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Each of these elements recurs in later accounts, including logging [[the Dakotas]], a giant camp, the winter of the blue snow, and stove skating. All four anecdotes are mirrored in J.&amp;nbsp;E. Rockwell's "Some Lumberjack Myths" six years later,&lt;ref name="rockwell"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MacGillivray's account, somewhat extended, reappeared in  ''[[The American Lumberman]]'' in 1910.  ''The American Lumberman'' followed up with a few sporadic editorials, such as "Paul Bunyan's Oxen,"  "In Paul Bunyan's Cook Shanty," and "Chronicle of Life and Works of Mr. Paul Bunyan." Rockwell's earlier story was one of the few to allude to Paul Bunyan's large stature, "eight feet tall and weighed 300 pounds," and introduce his big blue ox, prior to Laughead's commercialization of Paul Bunyan, although W&amp;nbsp;.D. Harrigan did refer to a giant pink ox in "Paul Bunyan's Oxen," circa 1914.&lt;ref name="harrigan"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all the articles, Paul Bunyan is praised as a logger of great physical strength and unrivaled skill.

== Scholarly research ==
K. Bernice Stewart, a student at the [[University of Wisconsin]], was working contemporaneously with Laughead to gather Paul Bunyan stories from woodsmen in the Midwest. Stewart was able to make a scholarly anthology of original anecdotes through a series of interviews.&lt;ref name="WHS2" /&gt;  These were published in 1916 as "Legends of Paul Bunyan, Lumberjack" in ''Transactions of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters'' and coauthored by her English professor Homer A. Watt. The research relates traditional narratives, some in multiple versions, and goes on to conclude that many probably existed in some part before they were set to revolve around Bunyan as a central character. Stewart argued in her analysis that Paul Bunyan belongs to a class of traveler's tales.&lt;ref name="stewart" /&gt;
{{quote box|align=left|width=30em|quote=“Bunyan was a powerful giant, seven feet tall and with a stride of seven feet. He was famous throughout the lumbering districts for his great physical strength.”|source=K. Bernice Stewart &amp; Homer A. Watt, "Legends of Paul Bunyan, Lumberjack"}}
Charles E. Brown was the curator of the Museum of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin and secretary of the Wisconsin Archaeological Society. He was another principal researcher who recorded early Paul Bunyan stories from lumberjacks.&lt;ref name="WHS3"&gt;{{Citation

| accessdate = May 2, 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published these anecdotes in short pamphlet format for the use of students of folklore. Much of his research was financed through the government-funded  Wisconsin Writers' Program.&lt;ref name="edmonds" /&gt;

In 2007, Michael Edmonds of the Wisconsin Historical Society began a thorough reinvestigation of the Paul Bunyan tradition, publishing his findings in ''Out of the Northwoods: The Many Lives of Paul Bunyan''. Edmonds concluded that Paul Bunyan had origins in the oral traditions of woodsmen working in Wisconsin camps during the turn of the 20th century, but such stories were heavily embellished and popularized by commercial interests.

== Laughead's influence ==
Laughead, in 1916, devised the original advertising pamphlet for the Red River Lumber Company utilizing the Paul Bunyan folk character. Laughead reworked original folklore while adding some tales of his own. This has led to significant confusion as to Paul Bunyan's legitimacy as a genuine folkloric character. Laughead took many liberties with the original oral source material. While still a lumberjack of gigantic stature and size with extreme power and strength, Laughead increased Paul Bunyan's height to tower over trees as well attributed him to the creation of several American landscapes, landmarks and natural wonders.&lt;ref&gt;http://mentalfloss.com/article/51199/11-landmarks-%E2%80%9Cbuilt%E2%80%9D-paul-bunyan&lt;/ref&gt; Laughhead noted that Paul Bunyan and Babe are said to have created the 10,000 lakes of [[Minnesota]]&lt;ref&gt; https://www.paulbunyantrail.com/&lt;/ref&gt; by their footprints.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exploreminnesota.com/travel-ideas/discover-paul-bunyan-in-minnesota/&lt;/ref&gt; Later commenters would elaborate in more detail pointing out bodies of water such as [[Lake Bemidji]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.visitbemidji.com/what-to-do/historical-cultural/paul-bunyan/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.visitbemidji.com/what-to-do/historical-cultural/paul-bunyan/tall-paul-tales/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paulbunyan.net/weathernews/webcam/lakefront.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some observers have noted that Lake Bemidji, itself, has a shape resembling something of a giant footprint when viewed from high above. Furthermore, latter authors, and possibly tourist agents, would add other geographic features to those Paul Bunyan was suppose to have created. Among others, Paul Bunyan has been credited with creating the [[Grand Canyon]] by pulling his ax behind him,&lt;ref&gt; https://southfloridareporter.com/legend-says-paul-bunyan-created-grand-canyon-dragging-axe-behind/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mount Hood]] by putting stones on his campfire.&lt;ref&gt;http://mentalfloss.com/article/51199/11-landmarks-%E2%80%9Cbuilt%E2%80%9D-paul-bunyan&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children's adaptations ==
[[File:Bunyanbigrockcandymountain.jpg|left|thumb|A still from the 1958 cartoon ''Paul Bunyan''. Typical among juvenile accounts, the cartoon features Paul Bunyan batting cannonballs in the [[American Revolutionary War]], sinking pirate ships, and building the [[Big Rock Candy Mountain]].]]
&lt;!--the following is intended to be a summary of better-known children's adaptations for the casual reader, information in regards to trivial or minor adaptations will be removed--&gt;
Running at variance to his origins in folklore, the character of Paul Bunyan has become a fixture for juvenile audiences since his debut in print. Typical among such adaptations is the further embellishment of stories pulled directly from William B. Laughead's pamphlet, and with very few elements from oral tradition adapted into them. Nearly all of the literature is presented in long narrative format, exaggerates Paul Bunyan's height to colossal proportions, and follows him from infancy to adulthood.

Some of the more enduring collections of stories include ''Paul Bunyan'' by James Stevens, ''Paul Bunyan Swings His Axe'' by Dell J. McCormick, ''Paul Bunyan'' by Esther Shephard, ''Paul Bunyan and His Great Blue Ox'' by Wallace Wadsworth, and ''The Marvelous Exploits of Paul Bunyan'' by William Laughead.

'' Legends of Paul Bunyan'' (1947) was the first book published by the prolific tall tale writer [[Harold Felton]].&lt;ref name=unl&gt;[http://archivespec.unl.edu/findingaids/MS040-felton-unl.html Harold W. Felton, Papers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913100015/http://archivespec.unl.edu/findingaids/MS040-felton-unl.html |date=2015-09-13 }}, archive description at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries (retrieved October 11, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Studios]] produced [[Paul Bunyan (film)|''Paul Bunyan'']] as an animated short musical. The feature starred [[Thurl Ravenscroft]], perhaps best known as the voice of [[Tony the Tiger]] for [[The Kellogg Company]], and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]].

In 2017, an animated film based loosely on the folktale titled ''[[Bunyan and Babe]]'' was released, starring [[John Goodman]] as Paul Bunyan.

Commentators such as Carleton C. Ames, Marshall Fitwick, and particularly [[Richard Dorson]] cite Paul Bunyan as an example of "[[fakelore]]," a literary invention passed off as an older folktale.  They point out that the majority of books about Paul Bunyan are composed almost entirely of elements with no basis in folklore, especially those targeted at juvenile audiences. Modern commercial writers are credited with setting Paul Bunyan on his rise to a nationally recognized figure, but this ignores the historical roots of the character in logging camps and forest industries.&lt;ref name="hartly" /&gt;

At the same time, several authors have come forward to propose alternative origins for Paul Bunyan. D. Laurence Rogers and others have suggested a possible connection between Paul Bunyan tales and the exploits of French-Canadian lumberjack [http://www.mybaycity.com/scripts/p3_v2/P3V3-0200.cfm?P3_ArticleID=497 Fabian Fournier] (1845 – 1875). From 1865 to 1875, Fournier worked for the H. M. Loud Company in the [[Grayling, Michigan]] area.&lt;ref name="edmonds" /&gt; James Stevens in his 1925 book ''Paul Bunyan'' makes another unverified claim that Paul Bunyan was a soldier in the [[Papineau Rebellion]] named Paul Bon Jean,&lt;ref name="steven"&gt;{{Citation
| last1     = Stevens

| title     = Paul Bunyan
| publisher = A. A. Knopf
| place     = New York
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this is occasionally repeated in other accounts.

Stewart and Watt acknowledge that they have not yet succeeded in definitively finding out whether Bunyan actually lived or was wholly mythical. They have noted, however, that some of the older lumberjacks whom they interviewed claimed to have known him or members of his crew, and the supposed location of his grave was actually pointed out in northern Minnesota.&lt;ref name="stewart" /&gt;  Bunyan's extreme gigantism was a later invention, and early stories either do not mention it or, as in the Stewart and Watt paper, refer to him as being about seven feet tall.

Included in this section is a comparison chart between early Paul Bunyan references, the Stewart and Watt paper, and the Laughead advertisement.

== In advertising and promotion ==
{{Main article| Paul Bunyan in popular culture}}&lt;!--this is the main article for a detailed history of the use of Paul Bunyan in promotion and popular culture; the following is intended to be a summary of the key points for the casual reader--&gt;
[[Image:Klamath-Paul-and-Babe.jpg|thumb|300px|Paul Bunyan (49 foot) and Babe the Blue Ox (35 foot) statues at [[Trees of Mystery]]. Note the size of the visitors at Babe's hoof.]]

William B. Laughead, an independent adman, was the first to utilize Paul Bunyan for commercial use in a series of campaigns for the Red River Lumber Company. His first endeavor was a pamphlet entitled "Introducing Mr. Paul Bunyan of Westwood, California," but it did not prove effective. It was not until "Tales about Paul Bunyan, Vol. II" appeared that the campaign gained momentum.&lt;ref name="WHS1" /&gt; Embellishing older exploits and adding some of his own, Laughead's revamped Paul Bunyan did not stay faithful to the original folktales.  Among other things, Laughead gave the name "Babe" to the blue ox, increased Paul Bunyan's height to impossible proportions, and created the first pictorial representation of Bunyan.&lt;ref name="laughead"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to significant confusion regarding the validity of Paul Bunyan as a genuine folkloric character.&lt;ref name="sharpe" /&gt;   Nevertheless, the Laughead pamphlets are regarded as one of the most popular collections, often appearing in a single, unabridged volume entitled: ''The Marvelous Exploits of Paul Bunyan.'' The Red River ad campaign ingrained Paul Bunyan as a nationally recognized figure, and it also affirmed his massive marketing appeal. Throughout the better part of the century, Paul Bunyan's name and image continued to be utilized in promoting various products, cities, and services. Across North America, giant statues of Paul Bunyan were erected to promote local businesses and tourism. A significant portion of these were produced from the 1960s through the 1970s by the company [[International Fiberglass]] as part of their "[[Muffler Men]]" series of giant fiberglass sculptures.&lt;ref name=RSA /&gt;

The statue of Paul Bunyan is regularly mentioned in the novel "IT" by Stephen King.

'''''Persuasions of the Witches' Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England''''' is a study of several [[Wicca]]n and [[ceremonial magic]] groups that assembled in southern England during the 1980s. It was written by the American anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] (1959–) of the [[University of California, San Diego]], and first published in 1989.

The work would be criticized by later academics working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] and [[western esotericism]], who charged it with dealing with those it was studying in a derogatory manner.

== Influence==
Writing in her paper within [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]]' edited ''Magical Religion and Modern Witchcraft'' anthology, Siân Reid described Luhrmann's work as "a solid ethnography". Nevertheless, she felt that the study "occasionally rings hollow" because Luhrmann failed to take into account the "subjective motivations for magical practice".{{sfn|Reid|1996|pp=146&amp;ndash;147}}
In her anthropological study of the U.S. Pagan community, ''[[Witching Culture]]'' (2004), the American academic [[Sabina Magliocco]] noted that her work both built upon and departed from Luhrmann's.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4735">'''Philippa Hobbs''' is a published South African art historian, an artist and an art collector. She was born in 1955 and matriculated at St Andrew's School in 1972. She studied art at the Johannesburg College of Art before finishing a post-graduate [[printmaking]] course at the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)]]. She then furthered her studies through [[University of South Africa]] (UNISA) and the [[Technikon Witwatersrand]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.durbanet.co.za/exhib/dag/hr/cl08.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbs was a senior Professor of History of Art at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg from 1988 to 1993. She has been noted for her contribution to the practice of art (with national and international exhibitions), art education, research and most recently, community development through art. Hobbs currently works are MTN Art Collection Curator and Arts and Culture Portolio Senior Manager.

==Art==

Hobbs was invited to contribute to the Images of Human Rights project in 1996, which involved artists making visual representation of each clause of South Africa's Bill of Rights. Hobbs' designated clause was Clause 8: Freedom of Expression, where her woodcut - 'Received by the Tongue' - shows the precarious balance between rights of expression and the subsequent consequences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.durbanet.co.za/exhib/dag/hr/cl08.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works by Hobbs include '''Dracunculus and Cat's Cradle'' - a woodcut produced in 1993 and ''Spiritus Candelabrae'' - a two colour woodcut produced in 1992.

==Teaching==

Hobbs also took classes and workshops from her own printmaking studio, 'Foot Print Studio'. The studio started in order to offer visual training and printmaking guidance to beginners and advanced artists.

==Publications==

Hobbs co-published Printmaking in a Transforming South Africa with Elizabeth Rankin in 1997 (David Philip Publishers), which discusses how printmaking has “traversed the divisions of South African art”&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, P., Rankin, E. 1997. Printmaking in a Transforming South Africa. Claremont: David Philip Publishers.{{ISBN|0-86486334-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and describes the technical and expressive components of printmaking, while also exploring the role it played as a form of resistance during the liberation struggle.

In 2003 Hobbs and Rankin published Rorke’s Drift Empowering Prints,&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, P., Rankin, E., 2003. Rorke’s Drift Empowering Prints. Cape Town: Double Story Books.{{ISBN|1-919930-13-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which looks at the Evangelical Lutheran Church Art and Craft Centre, more popularly known as [[Rorke's Drift Art and Craft Centre]], and the art produced by the black artists who studied there.

Hobbs’ most recent publication, Messages and Meaning, is a catalog for the MTN Art Collection for which she is curator. It is a collection of essays by writers such as Nessa Leibhammer, Elizabeth Rankin, Wilma Cruise and other prominent authors. It explores how the collection is “a tool for social investment, an educational resource, a means of inspiring in-house communication and debate, and a showcase of South African and African art to visitors.”&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, P. (ed.) 2006. Messages and Meaning. Johannesburg: David Krut Publishing.{{ISBN|0-9584860-6-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbs has also contributed to a well-known South African art publication, Taxi. Along with this involvement, she frequently writes the corresponding TAXI Art Education Supplement for school teachers and learners - allowing the information to be easily accessible. These supplements contain worksheets, information boxes about otherwise challenging art concepts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.davidkrutpublishing.com/taxi.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Irvine Best''' (1872 – 25 September 1959), often known as '''R. I. Best''', was an Irish scholar who specialised in [[Celtic Studies]].

Best was born into a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] family in [[Derry]] and educated at [[Foyle College]] before working for a time in a bank. As a young man he went to Paris to study [[Old Irish]], where he met [[Kuno Meyer]] and attended [[Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville|Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville]]'s lectures at the [[Collège de France]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Hypermedia Joyce Studies|journal = Hypermedia Joyce Studies| volume= 14 | date =March 2015| issn= 1801-1020|url = http://hjs.ff.cuni.cz/main/hjs.php?page=index_page|access-date = 2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to Ireland he translated the latter's  ''Le Cycle Mythologique Irlandais et la Mythologie Celtique'' into English and became Assistant Director at the [[National Library of Ireland]] in 1904.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

He married Edith Oldman, a musician, in 1906 and the couple were active in the administration of the [[Feis Ceoil]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Richard Irvine Best (1872-1959)|url = http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/b/Best_RI/life.htm|website = www.ricorso.net|access-date = 2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edith was six years Best's senior and the sister of Professor C. H. Oldman of [[University College Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Richard Irvine Best (1872-1959)|url = http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/b/Best_RI/life.htm|website = www.ricorso.net|access-date = 2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="census.nationalarchives.ie"&gt;http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai000127548/&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had no children.&lt;ref name="census.nationalarchives.ie"/&gt;

From 1913 onwards he published his multi-volume ''Bibliography of Irish Philology and Manuscript Literature: Publications'' (1913–1941). Best was director of the National Library from 1929 to 1940. He was Senior Professor of Celtic Studies at the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]] from its establishment in 1940. He was elected president of the [[Royal Irish Academy]] from 1943 to 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Review of Robert Lloyd Praeger: The Life of a Naturalist|jstor = 20500079|journal = Biology and Environment: Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy|date = 2000-01-01|pages = 70–74|volume = 100B|issue = 1|doi = 10.2307/20500079|first = James|last = White}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as chairman of the [[Irish Manuscripts Commission]] from 1948 to 1956 and was an honorary fellow of the Bibliographical Society of Ireland.&lt;ref name="ric"&gt;http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/b/Best_RI/life.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Best was awarded honorary doctorates by the [[National University of Ireland]] and [[Trinity College Dublin]] and the Leibniz Medal of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Royal Prussian Academy]].&lt;ref name=ric/&gt;

He died at his home, 57 Upper Leeson Street, on 25 September 1959.

Best was an acquaintance of [[J. M. Synge]] and [[James Joyce]]. Joyce depicted Best in [[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]] as one of the characters in the National Library scene in Episode 9 ''Scylla and Charybdis''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Best was known to have disapproved of Joyce's characterisation of him.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to [[Frank O'Connor]], Best boasted that he was the only person in Dublin from whom Joyce never succeeded in  borrowing  money. [[Flann O'Brien]] affectionately satirised him alongside his fellow scholars [[D. A. Binchy]] and [[Osborn Bergin]] in his poem ''Binchy and Bergin and Best''. He was a close friend of [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]], and according to a well-known story,  he had to explain to Moore that "it were better"  is not bad English but the [[subjunctive mood]]; Moore apparently had never heard of it, but vowed that he would never again use any mood  but the subjunctive.

The R. I. Best Memorial Lectures were established by the National Library in his honour.

The Elgaar Parishad was an event held on 31 December 2017 to commemorate the two hundredth anniversary of the [[Battle of Koregaon|Battle of Bhima Koregaon]]. It was organised by a coalition of 260 non-profit organisations at Pune's Shaniwarwada Fort,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scroll.in/article/881849/a-poet-a-lawyer-a-professor-these-are-the-five-activists-held-for-sparking-bhima-koregaon-clashes|title=A poet, a lawyer, a professor: These are the five activists held for sparking Bhima Koregaon clashes|last=Johari|first=Aarefa|work=Scroll.in|access-date=2018-08-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had approximately 35,000 people in attendance. The program consisted of a number of cultural performances, speeches and slogans.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scroll.in/article/892425/flashback-vibrant-scenes-from-punes-elgaar-parishad-which-led-to-the-bhima-koregaon-case-arrests|title=Flashback: Vibrant scenes from Pune’s Elgaar Parishad, which led to the Bhima Koregaon case arrests|last=Satheesh|first=Shone|work=Scroll.in|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Elgaar" means loud invitation or loud declaration.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scroll.in/article/892631/they-want-fascist-forces-to-reign-retired-judges-who-organised-elgar-parishad-speak-out|title=‘They want fascist forces to reign’: Retired judges who organised Pune’s Elgaar Parishad speak out|last=Johari|first=Aarefa|work=Scroll.in|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The event was organised at the [[Shaniwar Wada|Shaniwarwada Fort]] in Pune on the eve of the bicentennial anniversary of the [[Battle of Koregaon|Battle of Bhima Koregaon]]. The Shaniwarwada Fort was the seat of power of the [[Peshwa|Peshwas]], the de-facto rulers of the [[Maratha Empire]]. Under the Peshwas, the caste system was practiced rigidly, and oppression of the lower castes was severe. In the [[Battle of Koregaon|Battle of Bhima Koregaon]], a regiment of [[Mahar|Mahar Dalits]] under the British Army had defeated the Peshwa's army. This victory is very important to [[Dalit|Dalits]], who see it as a victory over their oppressors. Organising the Parishad at the [[Shaniwar Wada|Shaniwarwada Fort]] was thus seen as a symbol of [[Dalit]] assertion.

Before the event, two marches were organised through several districts of Maharashtra and culminating in Pune with artists, activists, theatre performers and musicians among others. These marches held public meetings to rally support for Dalit victims of atrocities and collect donations for the Elgar Parishad.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Event ==
The event began at 2 PM under six tents pitched in front of the Shaniwarwada Fort. After the tents filled up at 2.30, police refused to let more people in, fearing stampede. The stage seated the organisers and speakers of the event, including Gujarat MLA [[Jignesh Mevani]], Dalit activist Radhika Vemula, Adivasi activist [[Soni Sori]], Dalit leader [[Prakash Yashwant Ambedkar|Prakash Ambedkar]], [[Bhim Army]] President Vinay Ratan Singh, retired [[Bombay High Court]] Justice BG Kholse-Patil, and student leader [[Umar Khalid]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A number of cultural performances with anti-caste themes were staged. Shahirs performed songs in tribute of [[Tukaram]], [[Jyotirao Phule|Jotirao Phule]], [[Shivaji]] and [[Shahu of Kolhapur|Shahu]]. A dance troupe performed actobatics and hip-hop groups also performed. Before Radhika Vemula made her speech, she was invited to smash a stack of pots signifying the [[Caste system in India|varna system]] in a symbolic gesture of annihilating caste. Vadgam MLA and anti-caste activist, [[Jignesh Mevani]] read out an extract from [[Narendra Modi|Narendra Modi's]] book, Karmyog, which said that the work of cleaning excreta, a task mostly performed by Dalits due to caste compulsions, is an experience in spirituality. He later had an FIR filed against him.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

== Aftermath ==
On 1 January 2018, [[Bhima Koregaon protests|violence broke out at Bhima Koregaon]], where [[lakh]]s of [[Dalit]]s had converged to commemorate the battle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One person was killed, and three others injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thewire.in/caste/one-killed-clashes-bhima-koregaon-battle-anniversary-event-pune|title=One Killed in Clashes at Bhima Koregaon Battle Anniversary Event in Pune; Situation Tense in Maharashtra|website=The Wire|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the months following the event, a number of people present at the event were arrested under laws such as the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). This included [[Surendra Gadling]], [[Rona Wilson]], [[Mahesh Raut]], [[Sudhir Dhawale]] and [[Shoma Sen]]. [[Pune Police]] alleged that the event was sponsored by [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)|Maoists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scroll.in/latest/881576/bhima-koregaon-violence-activist-rona-wilson-and-lawyer-surendra-gadling-among-five-arrested|title=Bhima Koregaon violence: Activist Rona Wilson and lawyer Surendra Gadling among five arrested|last=Staff|first=Scroll|work=Scroll.in|access-date=2018-08-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; An FIR was filed against Jignesh Mevani for promoting enmity on grounds of religion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It was alleged by the Pune Police that the event was organised by members of the banned [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)]]. They said that it instigated violence at [[2018 Bhima Koregaon violence|Bhima Koregaon]]. However, Justices BG Kolse-Patil and [[P. B. Sawant|PB Sawant]] refuted their claims. The Justices said that it was the two of them who were the main organisers and sole funders of the event, and that they had held a similar event against communalism and Hindutva in October 2015 at the same venue.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet''' [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]], [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (10 December 1845 – 18 January 1937)&lt;ref name="collier"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Fifoot |first=C. H. S. |editor=William D. Halsey |encyclopedia=Collier's Encyclopedia |title=Pollock, Sir Frederick |year=1976 |publisher=Macmillan Educational Corporation |volume=19 |location=New York |page=218 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English jurist best known for his ''History of English Law before the Time of Edward I'', written with [[Frederic William Maitland|F.W. Maitland]], and his lifelong correspondence with US Supreme Court Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]]. He was a [[Cambridge Apostle]].

== Life ==
Frederick Pollock was the eldest son of [[Sir William Frederick Pollock, 2nd Baronet|William Frederick Pollock]], Master of the Court of Exchequer, and Juliet Creed, daughter of the Rev, Harry Creed. He was the grandson of [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 1st Baronet]], [[Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer]], the great-nephew of Field Marshal [[Sir George Pollock, 1st Baronet]], and the first cousin of [[Ernest Pollock, 1st Viscount Hanworth]], [[Master of the Rolls]].

He was educated at [[Eton College]], where he was a King's Scholar, and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was elected Fellow in 1868 (later Honorable Fellow in 1920).&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=PLK863F|name=Pollock, Frederick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="My"&gt;''For My Grandson'' (1933) John Murray, Note B: ''Personal Dates''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871 he was admitted to the Bar. He wrote a series of text books that took a new approach to the teaching of English Law including ''The Principles of Contract at Law and in [[Equity (law)|Equity]]'' (1876) and ''The Law of [[Torts]]'' (1887).&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt; Rather than relying on specific applications of law these works emphasised underlying principles. They acted as models for future textbooks and helped modernise English legal education. Pollock taught at the University of Oxford (1883–1903),&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt; as [[Corpus Professor of Jurisprudence]]. He was Professor of Common Law in the Inns of Court (1884–1890).&lt;ref name="My"/&gt; He was Editor of the Law Reports from 1895 to 1935. He was the first editor of the ''[[Law Quarterly Review]]'' which was founded in 1885.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt; He was also, in 1894, the Chairman of [[The Society of Authors]]&lt;ref name="pollock"&gt;The Times 1 June 1894&lt;/ref&gt; He was admitted to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28511|page=5025|date=7 July 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected Treasurer of Lincoln's Inn in 1931.&lt;ref name="My"/&gt;

'''Ta'zieh''' or '''Ta'zïye''' or '''Ta'zīya''' or '''Tazīa''' or '''Ta'ziyeh''', ({{lang-ar|تعزية}}, {{lang-fa|تعزیه}}, {{lang-ur|{{nastaliq|تعزیہ}}}}) means comfort, condolence or expression of grief. It comes from roots ''aza'' (عزو and عزى) which means mourning.

Depending on the region, time, occasion, religion, etc. the word can signify different cultural meanings and practices:
*In [[Persian culture|Persian cultural]] reference it is categorized as '''Condolence Theater''' or '''[[Passion Play]]''' inspired by a historical and religious event, the tragic death of Hussein, symbolizing epic spirit and resistance.
*In [[South Asia]] and in the [[Caribbean]] it refers specifically to the '''Miniature Mausoleums''' (imitations of the mausolems of Karbala, generally made of coloured paper and bamboo) used in ritual processions held in the month of Muharram.
Ta'zieh, primarily known from the Persian tradition, is a shi'ite Muslim ritual that reenacts the death of Hussein (the prophet Muhammad's grandson) and his male children and companions in a brutal massacre on the plains of Karbala, Iraq in the year 680 A.D. His death was the result of a power struggle in the decision of control of the Muslim community (called the [[Caliphate|caliph]]) after the death of the Prophet Muhammad.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asiasociety.org/time-out-memory-taziyeh-total-drama|title=Time Out of Memory: Ta'ziyeh, the Total Drama|last=Chelkowski|first=Peter|date=2003|website=Asia Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, we know of 250 Ta'zieh pieces. They were collected by an Italian ambassador to Iran, Cherulli, and added to a collection which can be found in the Vatican Library. Various other scripts can be found scattered throughout Iran.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Beeman, William O. "Theatre History #27: Learning about Ta'Ziyeh with Dr. William O. Beeman." Audio Blog Post. Theatre History. HowlRound. 27 Mar 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Origins of Ta'zieh ==
Ta'zieh as a kind of passion play is a kind of comprehensive indigenous form considered as being the national form of Iranian theatre which have pervasive influence in the Iranian works of drama and play. It originates from some famous mythologies and rites such as Mithraism, Sug-e-Siavush (Mourning for Siavush) and Yadegar-e-Zariran or Memorial of Zarir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alizadeh|first1=Farideh|last2=Hashim|first2=Mohd Nasir|title=When the attraction of Ta'ziyeh is diminished, the community should inevitably find a suitable replacement for it|journal=Taylor &amp; Francis, Cogent Arts &amp; Humanities|date=2016|volume= 3|issue=1|doi=10.1080/23311983.2016.1190482|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/23311983.2016.1190482}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alizadeh|first1=Farideh|last2=Hashim|first2=Mohd Nasir|title=Ta'ziyeh-influenced Theate|date=2016|isbn=978-1519731791|url=https://www.amazon.com/Taziyeh-influenced-Theatre-Farideh-Alizadeh/dp/1519731795}}doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.3511154 &amp;  doi:10.5281/zenodo.59379.svg&lt;/ref&gt; The Ta'zieh tradition originated in Iran in the late 17th century.

There are two branches of [[Islam]]; the Sunni and the Shi'i. The Sunnis make up about 85-90% of Muslims, but the Ta'zieh tradition is performed by Shi'i Muslims during the first month of the Muslim calendar, Muharram, one of the four sacred months of the Islam calendar.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theatre Histories: An Introduction|last=Zarilli|first=Phillip B.|last2=McConachie|first2=Bruce|last3=Williams|first3=Gary Jay|last4=Sorgenfrei|first4=Carol Fisher|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-22727-8|location=USA|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muharram means forbidden. The Ta'Zieh is performed each year on the 10th day of Muharram, a historically significant day for the Shi'i Muslims because that was the day of Hussein's slaughter.  Each year the same story is told, so the spectators know the story very well and know what to expect. However, this does not negatively affect audience levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolution of Tradition Theatre and The Development of Modern Theatre in Iran|last=Emami|first=Iraj|publisher=University of Edinburgh|year=1987|isbn=|location=Scotland|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the Ta'zieh welcomes large crowds and the audience members are known to cry each time the story is told in mourning and respect for Hussein.

A strong belief in the Muslim community was that nothing created by regular people could be better than the way [[Allah]] created it, so all other creation was deemed disrespectful. Because of this, there are not many accounts-visually or otherwise- of this religious tradition. During the tradition it was very important that all spectators knew the actors were not disrespecting Allah, so most often, the actors had their scripts on stage with them so it was clear that they were not trying to depict another person that Allah did not create.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The ritual was eventually banned by the authorities in Iran because the ritual was being exploited for political advances. Ta'zieh is not performed regularly in Iran and has not been seen at all in certain provinces of the region since 1920.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caron|first=Nelly|date=1975|title=The Ta'Zieh, the Secret Theatre of Iran|jstor=43620726|journal=The World of Music|volume=17|pages=3–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; France was the first non-Muslim country that Ta'zieh was performed in 1991. Since then, the tradition has been seen in non-Persian cities like Avignon and Paris in France, Parma and Rome in Italy, and New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/tazia|title=TA'ZIA|last=|first=|date=July 15, 2009|website=Encyclopaedia Iranica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Persian culture it refers to condolence theater and [[Naqqali]] which are traditional [[Persia]]n [[theatrical]] genres in which the [[drama]] is conveyed wholly or predominantly through music and singing. It dates from before the Islamic era and the [[tragedy]] of Saiawush in [[Shahnameh]] is one of the best examples.

In Persian tradition, Ta'zieh and Parde-khani, inspired by historical and religious events, symbolize epic spirit and resistance. The common themes are heroic tales of love and sacrifice and of resistance against the evil.

While in the West the two major genres of drama have been [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]], in Persia, Ta'zieh seems to be the dominant genre. Considered as Persian opera, Ta'zieh resembles European [[opera]] in many respects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/arts/story/2005/10/051005_az-tehransymphony-orchestra.shtml Iranian performance of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] 9th Symphony (BBC Persian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cinema of Iran|Persian cinema]] and [[Persian Symphonic Music|Persian symphonic music]] have been influenced by the long tradition of Ta'zieh in Iran. [[Abbas Kiarostami]], famous Iranian film maker, made a documentary movie titled "A Look to Ta'zieh" in which he explores the relationship of the audience to this theatrical form. [[Nasser Taghvaee]] also made a documentary on Ta'zieh titled "Tamrin e Akhar".

The appearance of the characteristic dramatic form of Persia known as the ''ta'zïye'' [[Mu'izz ad-Dawla]], the king of [[Buyid dynasty]], in 963. As soon as the [[Safavid Dynasty]] was established in [[Persia]] in 1501 and the Shiism of the [[Twelvers]] adopted as the official sect, the state took interest in theater as a tool of propagating Shiism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/IOL-English/dowalia/art-2000-August-03/art3.asp Iranian Theater Propagates Shiism]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women in Ta'Zieh ===
Women were not considered active members of the Ta'zieh performance ritual. Almost all women in these rituals were played by young males, however on some occasions little girls under the age of nine were able to fulfill small roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/cinema/articles/taziyeh_drag_kings_queens.php|title=Ta'ziyeh; Karbala Drag Kings and Queens|last=Mottahedeh|first=Negar|date=|website=Iran Chamber|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were traditionally played by males who would wear all black and veil their faces. During the festival period, the [[tekyeh]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s were lavishly decorated by the women of the community that the performance took place, with the prized personal possessions of the local community. Refreshments were prepared by women and served to the spectators by the children of well-off families.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Society women were invited to watch the performance from the boxes above the general viewing area.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Generally the audience consisted of the more well-off families as they regarded Ta'zieh as entertainment, while the lower-class community members thought of it as an important religious ritual. The Ta'Zieh gained popularity during the 19th century and women painted scenes from Ta'Zieh performances on the stage on canvases and recorded history. This was a huge step in the history of [[islamic art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/tazia|title=Narrative Painting and Painting Representation in Qajar Iran|last=Idem|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance of the Space ===
In Persian Ta'Zieh, the space is very important. Originally, Ta'zieh dramas, like other Western Passion Plays, were performed in a public arena, allowing large audiences to convene. They later moved to smaller spaces like courtyards and spaces within the homes of private citizens, but eventually ended up being performed in temporarily constructed performance spaces called tekyehs or husseiniyehs. The most famous tekyeh is called the [[Tekyeh Dowlat]]. It was built by the King of Persia, [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] and was situated in the capital of [[Iran]], [[Tehran]]. Tekyehs (with the exception of the Tekyeh Dowlat) were almost always constructed for temporary use and then demolished at the end of Muharram. The Tekyeh Dowlat was a permanent space built in 1868, but was torn down 79 years later in 1947 due to lack of use and replaced by a bank. Its capacity was 4,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eternal Performance: Ta'ziyeh and Other Shiite Rituals|last=Chelkowski|first=Peter|publisher=Seagull|year=2010|isbn=978 1 9064 9 751 4|location=India|pages=92–105|chapter=Identification and Analysis of the Scenic Space in Traditional Iranian Theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt; They varied in size fitting anywhere between a dozen to thousands of spectators.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Tekyehs were somewhat open-air, but almost always had awnings of sorts atop the building to shield the spectators and actors from sun and rain. All performers in a Ta'Zieh ceremony never leave the stage. The stage is elevated between one and two feet from the ground and split into four areas: one for the protagonists, antagonists, smaller subplots, and props.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Unlike most other theater traditions, especially Western theater traditions, the Ta'Zieh stage and its use of props were minimalist and stark. All tekyehs are designed so that the Ta'Zieh performance happens in-the-round to create a more intense experience between the actors and the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asiasociety.org/time-out-memory-taziyeh-total-drama|title=Time Out of Memory: Ta'Zieh, The Total Drama|last=Chelkowski|first=Peter|date=2003|website=Asia Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled spectators to feel like they were part of the action on stage and sometimes encouraged them to become physically active members of the performance.

=== Costumes and Character Distinctions ===
Costumes for a Ta'Zieh ritual are what is considered representational in terms of theater. They are not meant to present reality. The main goal of the costume design was not to be historically accurate, but to help the audience recognize which type of character they were looking at. Villains were the Sunni opponents of Imam Hussein. They are always dressed in red. The protagonists, family members of Hussein, were dressed in green if they were male characters.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Anyone about to die was in white. Women were always portrayed by men in all black.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One way to distinguish character besides the color of their costume is how they deliver their lines. The protagonists or family of Imam Hussein sing or chant their lines and the villains will declaim their lines. If a person is traveling in a circle on or around the stage, that meant they were going a long distance (usually represented the distance between Mecca and Karbala). Traveling in a straight line represented a shorter distance traveled.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Animals in the Tradition ===
Often animals were used in the performance of a Ta'zieh. Often performers of Ta'zieh were on horseback. Most men from the time they were young would train to be able to ride a horse because it was an honor in Persian culture to be part of the Ta'zieh, especially to play a character who rode horseback. There were often other animals used in the tradition as well. These other animals were: camels, sheep or sometimes even a lion.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Usually the lion is not real, and is just represented by a man wearing a  mask of some sort.{{Husayn}}

==Tazia==
{{Islamic Culture}}
Like Western passion plays, ta'zia dramas were originally performed outdoors at crossroads and other public places where large audiences could gather. Much like in Iranian performances, these performances in other countries also began taking place in the courtyards of inns and private homes, but eventually unique structures called takias (referred to as tekyehs in Persian Ta'zieh) were constructed for the specific purpose of staging the plays. Community cooperation was encouraged in the building and decoration of the takias, whether the funds for the enterprise were provided by an individual philanthropist or by contributions from the residents of its particular locality. The takias varied in size, from intimate structures which could only accommodate a few dozen spectators to large buildings capable of holding an audience of more than a thousand people. All takias, regardless of their size and geographic location, are constructed as theaters-in-the-round to intensify the dynamic between actors and audience. the spectators are literally surrounded by the action and often become physical participants in the play. In unwalled takias, it is not unusual for combat scenes to occur behind the audience.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=THE PASSION OF HOSAYN | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Iranica | accessdate=2008-01-19|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hosayn-b-ali-iii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''The Golden Key''''' is a [[fairy tale]] written by [[George MacDonald]].  It was published in ''Dealings with the Fairies'' (1867).

It is particularly noted for the intensity of the suggestive imagery, which implies a spiritual meaning to the story without providing a transparent allegory for the events in it.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Manlove, ''Christian Fantasy: from 1200 to the Present'' p nope168-9 {{ISBN|0-268-00790-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
A young boy listens to his Great-aunt's stories about a magical golden key found at the end of a rainbow.  One day, he sees an immense rainbow and sets out to find its end in an [[Enchanted forest|enchanted forest]]. As the forest is in [[Fairy]]land where everything has an opposite effect, the rainbow only glows brighter when the sun sets. He finds the key, then it dawns on him that he does not know where the lock is.

In the same village on the border of this forest, a merchant's neglected daughter is frightened by the [[Fairy|fairies]].  Their first attempt fails but when they make her think [[Goldilocks and the Three Bears|the three bears]] are coming into her bedroom, she flees into the woods.

A tree tries to trap her, but a feathered airborne fish frees her, then leads her to a wise woman's cottage. A pot is boiling there, and the air fish flies into it.  The lady asks her name; the girl says that the servants always called her Tangle, and the lady decides that although her tangled hair was their fault for not looking after her, Tangle is a pretty name.  She says she is called Grandmother, and that it has been three years since Tangle ran away from the "bears".  She has the girl washed by fish and dresses her. Then they eat the air fish for dinner after the lady assures her that the air fish had voluntarily gone into the pot to be their food, and the cooking pot produces a little-winged figure, who flies off.

The lady sends another air fish after the young man at the foot of the rainbow.  At supper the next day, the young man, Mossy, arrives.  The lady tells Mossy that if he searches for the keyhole, he will find it, and sends Tangle with him. In their wanderings, they come across a valley where beautiful shadows fill the air, where they stay, grow old, and then resolve to find the land the marvelous shadows fall from; but they become separated so they each continue their journey alone.

Tangle meets with the winged [[Aeranthes|aëranth]] (air-flower) that used to be the fish, who leads her to the mountain. There she meets the [[Old Man of the Sea]].  He can not tell her the way to the land from which the shadows fall and send her to his brother the Old Man of the Earth.  He also does not know and sends her to the Old Man of the Fire.

: Then the Old Man of the Earth stooped over the floor of the cave, raised a huge stone from it, and left it leaning. It disclosed a great hole that went [[Vertical direction|plumb-down]].
:"That is the way," he said.
:"But there are no stairs."
:"You must throw yourself in. There is no other way."

She throws herself in and at the end of the hole, finds the Old Man of the Fire. This Old Man turns out to be youngest of all, a wise child arranging colored spheres in a significant way. After giving her protection from the fiery path, he sends her out following a snake, which will lead her to that land.

Mossy also finds the Man of the Sea, rightly recognizing him as death, and he gains the power to walk across the sea. After climbing a precipice, he enters a chamber where the colors of the rainbow appear as columns of light.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlocking Wonder in 'The Golden Key'", Ruth Sanderson [http://www.worksofmacdonald.com/ruth-sanderson-unlocking-wonder/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; Tangle is waiting for him. She shows him another door that his key unlocks, opening onto a glowing stairway to the land they were searching for, from which the shadows fall.  As they start to climb, the story ends.

==1967 edition==
An edition was published in 1967 by [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] with illustrations by [[Maurice Sendak]] and an Afterword by [[W. H. Auden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/golden-key/oclc/762195659 ''The Golden Key'' 1967 edition] at [[WorldCat]].&lt;/ref&gt;

De Haven originally wanted to be cartoonist before attending college,&lt;ref name="Michaux Dempster"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/v4n2/features/de_haven_t_021506/de_haven_t_text.htm |title=An Interview with Tom De Haven |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author=Michaux Dempster |date=Fall 2005 |work=Vol 4, No. 2 |publisher=Blackbird}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by the time he graduated from the university, he realized that he would never be a professional cartoonist, and considers the realization "the First Great Disappointment Of My Life".&lt;ref name="Caroline Miniscule"/&gt; He received a [[Sociology]] degree from [[Rutgers University]] in 1971 and an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] from [[Bowling Green State University]] in 1973.

An avid reader of [[comic book]]s and [[graphic novel]]s, De Haven considers himself a [[Narrative#Literary theory|narrative writer]], and considers the storytelling style of comics to have been a major influence on his writing since he was a child of almost six or seven.&lt;ref name="Michaux Dempster"/&gt;

He began teaching creative writing [[part-time]] at [[Hofstra University]] in 1981, before moving in 1987 to Rutgers to teach [[American Studies]] (including one of the first college courses on American comics) before relocating to Richmond, Virginia to become a [[full-time]] teacher.

De Haven is currently{{When|date=December 2009}} a full professor of Creative Writing at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]] in the MFA program, and often teaches at least one American Studies course, including "The Graphic Novel",&lt;ref name="Caroline Miniscule"/&gt; De Haven is also the co-creator with author Laura Browder of the [[First Novelist|VCU's First Novelist Award]], honoring the best debut novel published during a calendar year. He is also a licensed private investigator.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} He considers himself a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], and has been criticized for anti-[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] statements he has made over the years.&lt;ref name="thunderchild"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thethunderchild.com/Interviews/Books/TomDeHaven.html |title=The Thunder Child Interview |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author=Caroline Miniscule |work=interview |publisher=The ThunderChild}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author noted in an interview that he agreed with [[Robert Crumb]]'s observation that the Thirties was the pinnacle of American culture. He also notes in the same interview that he finds truth to [[Art Spiegelman]]'s statement "that we are, for whatever reason, most nostalgic for the decade before the one we were born in", as he was born in the Forties.&lt;ref name="thunderchild" /&gt;

As a freelance journalist, he has written [[Literary criticism|criticism]] for publications such as the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. De Haven’s novels include the ''Funny Paper'' trilogy (consisting of ''Funny Papers'' (1985), ''Derby Dugan’s Depression Funnies'' (1996) and ''Dugan Under Ground'' (2001)). The trilogy's [[Plot (narrative)|storyline]] stretches from  the beginnings of the newspaper [[comic strip]]s in the 1890s to the 1970s.

The ''New York Times Book Review'' called the ''Derby'' books "a mighty accomplishment: [[John Dos Passos]]’s [[U.S.A. trilogy]] for comic [[geeks]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/07/13/nnp/19817.html |title=Mighty Accomplishment |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author= |year=2001 |work=New York Times Book Review |publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Globe]] hails the trilogy as a "wild ride" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniclebooks.com/Chronicle/pressroom/0811844358.pdf |title=It's Superman! |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author= |work=Pressroom |publisher=Chronicle Books |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313233804/http://www.chroniclebooks.com/Chronicle/pressroom/0811844358.pdf |archivedate=13 March 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, his novel ''It’s Superman'' reinvented the early years of the well-known superhero of the same name amidst the [[Great Depression]]. The author noted his initial apprehension when he was contacted by [[DC Comics]] in 1997 in regards to writing a novel about [[Superman]]: "[S]hould I do a novel with a character that I don’t own? So I had to think about it, but I didn’t think about it very long, really. I just thought...this is too good to let go...they were giving me [[blank cheque|carte blanche]]."&lt;ref name="Michaux Dempster"/&gt; He states that his prior novels about comic strips are what prompted DC to contact him about writing the [[period piece]]. For the novel, he took as his inspiration the early Superman stories of the thirties through the fifties; wherein the hero is not fighting super-villains and Lex Luthor, but clearing slums in the [[New Deal]] era and expose corrupt politicians.&lt;ref name="Michaux Dempster"/&gt; De Haven says he was aiming for his hero to develop a social conscience during the Great Depression. He states in the interview that only real departure from the Superman that [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] originally created is that while their original hero lived in Cleveland, De Haven places his hero in the real "[[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]" of New York.&lt;ref name="Michaux Dempster"/&gt;

==Awards and honors==
De Haven's awards include a fellowship from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, and he has twice won fellowships from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/v4n2/features/de_haven_t_021506/de_haven_t.htm |title=Tom De Haven |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author=Michaux Dempster |date=November 2005 |work=Interview |publisher=Blackbird}}&lt;/ref&gt; His novel, ''Depression Funnies'', received an [[American Book Award]] in 1997. ''Dugan Under Ground'' received the [[Library of Virginia]] Fiction Award (also called the Library of Virginia Literary Awards.

[[File:Vesica_piscis_circles.svg|thumb|The vesica piscis is the intersection of two congruent disks, each centered on the perimeter of the other.]]
The '''vesica piscis''' is a type of [[Lens (geometry)|lens]], a mathematical [[shape]] formed by the [[Intersection (Euclidean geometry)|intersection]] of two [[Disk (mathematics)|disks]] with the same radius, intersecting in such a way that the center of each disk lies on the perimeter of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 6
 | year = 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Latin]], "vesica piscis" literally means "bladder of a [[fish]]", reflecting the shape's resemblance to the conjoined dual air bladders ("[[swim bladder]]") found in most fish. In [[Italian language|Italian]], the shape's name is ''[[mandorla]]'' ("[[almond]]").

[[File:Euclid-proof.jpg|thumb|The vesica piscis in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']]]]
This figure appears in the first proposition of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], where it forms the first step in constructing an [[equilateral triangle]] using a [[compass-and-straightedge construction|compass and straightedge]]. The triangle has as its [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] the two disk centers and one of the two sharp corners of the vesica piscis.&lt;ref name="The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heath|first1=Sir Thomas L.|title=The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements|date=1956|publisher=Dover Publications Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0486600904|pages=241|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical description ==
Mathematically, the vesica piscis is a special case of a [[lens (geometry)|lens]], the shape formed by the intersection of two disks.

The mathematical ratio of the height of the vesica piscis to the width across its center is the [[square root of 3]], or 1.7320508... (since if straight lines are drawn connecting the centers of the two circles with each other and with the two points where the circles intersect, two equilateral triangles join along an edge). The ratios 265:153 = 1.7320261... and 1351:780 = 1.7320513... are two of a series of [[Best rational approximation|approximations]] to this value, each with the property that no better approximation can be obtained with smaller whole numbers.  [[Archimedes|Archimedes of Syracuse]], in his ''[[On the Measurement of the Circle]]'', uses these ratios as upper and lower bounds:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Heath| first = Thomas Little| year = 1897| title = The Works of Archimedes| publication-place = Cambridge University| pages = ''lxxvii ''; 50| url = https://archive.org/details/worksofarchimede029517mbp | accessdate = 2010-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1351}{780} &gt; \sqrt{3} &gt; \tfrac{265}{153}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Area===
[[Image:Vesica Piscis.jpg|thumb|The areas in blue – an equilateral triangle and a segment form together a sector of one sixth of the circle (60°)]]

The area of the vesica piscis is formed by two [[equilateral triangle]]s and four equal [[circular segment]]s. In the drawing one triangle and one segment appear in blue.

One triangle and one segment form a sector of one sixth of the circle (60°).
The area of the sector is then: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{6} \pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the side of the equilateral triangle has length {{mvar|r}}, its area is &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} r^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The area of the segment is the difference between those two areas:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{6} \pi r^2 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} r^2&lt;/math&gt;.

By summing the areas of two triangles and four segments, we obtain the area of the vesica piscis:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{6} (4\pi - 3\sqrt{3})r^2 \approx 1.2284r^2&lt;/math&gt;

==Uses==
[[Image:Chalice Well Cover.jpg|thumb|The modern cover of the [[Chalice Well]] with an artistic rendering of the vesica piscis]]
The two circles of the vesica piscis, or three circles forming in pairs three vesicae, are commonly used in [[Venn diagram]]s. Arcs of the same three circles can also be used to form the [[triquetra]] symbol, and the [[Reuleaux triangle]].

In [[Christian art]], some [[aureola]]s are in the shape of a vertically oriented vesica piscis, and the [[Seal (device)#Ecclesiastical seals|seals of ecclesiastical organizations]] can be enclosed within a vertically oriented vesica piscis (instead of the more usual circular enclosure). Also, the [[icthys]] symbol incorporates the vesica piscis shape.

[[Ecclesiastical heraldry]] of the [[Catholic Church]] appeared first in [[Seal (device)#Ecclesiastical seals|seals]], nearly all vesica-shaped.&lt;ref&gt;
Arthur Charles Fox-Davies in  ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1910) {{CathEncy | wstitle=Ecclesiastical Heraldry | short=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oce.catholic.com/oce/browse-page-scans.php?id=dc013cb5997fb53cc04095551d3b9e33 Scanned reproduction of the article, with illustrations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224021607/http://oce.catholic.com/oce/browse-page-scans.php?id=dc013cb5997fb53cc04095551d3b9e33 |date=2014-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover of the [[Chalice Well]] in [[Glastonbury]] ([[Somerset]], [[United Kingdom]]) depicts a stylized version of the vesica piscis design (see picture).

The vesica piscis has been used as a symbol within [[Freemasonry]], most notably in the shapes of the collars worn by officiants of the Masonic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;J. S. M. Ward, An Interpretation of Our Masonic Symbols, 1924, pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also considered the proper shape for the enclosure of the seals of Masonic lodges.&lt;ref&gt;Albert G. Mackey, Encyclopaedia of Freemasonry, 1921 ed., vol. 2, p. 827.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shawn Eyer, [http://academialodge.org/article_vesica_piscis.php The Vesica Piscis and Freemasonry]. Retrieved on 2009-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vesica piscis is also used as proportioning system in architecture, in particular [[Gothic architecture]]. The system was illustrated in [[Cesare Cesariano]]'s Vitruvius (1521), which he called "the rule of the German architects".

The vesica piscis is a leitmotif of architect [[Carlo Scarpa]] and is used as a “viewing device” in Tomba Brion ([[Brion Cemetery]]) in [[San Vito d'Altivole]], Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/conferences/human/papers/Cannata.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401065416/http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/conferences/human/papers/Cannata.pdf |archivedate=2010-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Virunga National Park''' ({{lang-fr|Parc National des Virunga}}) is a national park in the [[Albertine Rift]] Valley in the eastern part of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. It was created in 1925 and is among the first protected areas in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=Mubalama2004&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Mubalama, L. and Mushenzi, N. |year=2004 |title=Monitoring law enforcement and illegal activities in the northern sector of the Parc National des Virunga, Democratic Republic of Congo |journal=Pachyderm |issue=36 |pages=16–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In altitude, it ranges from {{convert|680|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the [[Semliki River]] valley to {{convert|5109|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the [[Rwenzori Mountains]]. From north to south it extends about {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}}, largely along the  international borders with [[Uganda]] and [[Rwanda]] in the east.&lt;ref name=Crawford2008&gt;{{cite book |authors=Crawford, A. and Bernstein, J. |year=2008 |title=MEAs, Conservation and Conflict – A case study of Virunga National Park, DRC |publisher=International Institute for Sustainable Development |location=Geneva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the early 1920s, several proponents of the European [[conservation movement]] championed the idea of creating a protected area in northeastern [[Belgian Congo]], among them [[Victor van Straelen]], [[Jean Massart]] and [[Jean-Marie Derscheid]]. When Albert National Park was established in April 1925 as Africa’s first national park, it was conceived as a science-oriented nature reserve with the aim of studying and preserving wildlife and so-called ‘primitive’ [[hunter-gatherer]] [[African Pygmies]]. In 1926, Derscheid headed the first Belgian mission to [[Cartography|cartograph]] Albert National Park, which encompassed an area of {{convert|500|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} around the extinct volcanoes [[Mount Karisimbi]] and [[Mount Mikeno]]. The protected area was extended in 1929 by Virunga National Park, which encompassed the [[Virunga Mountains]], parts of the [[Rutshuru Territory]] and the plains south of Lake Edward. Its initial size of {{convert|2920.98|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} was enlarged step by step in subsequent years.&lt;ref name=Harroy1993&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harroy, J.P. |year=1993 |title=Contribution à l'histoire jusque 1934 de la création de l'Institut des parcs nationaux du Congo belge |journal=Civilisations.

In 1934, the ''Institut des Parcs Nationaux du Congo Belge'' was founded as the governing body for national parks in the Belgian Congo.&lt;ref name=Harroy1993/&gt;
Between the early 1930s and 1961, several expeditions to Albert National Park were carried out by Belgian scientists, the second headed by [[Gaston-François de Witte]]. They studied and collected [[zoological specimen]]s of wildlife for the ''Musée Royal d'Histoire Naturelle de Belgique'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schouteden, H. |author-link=Henri Schouteden |year=1938 |title=Exploration du Parc National Albert: Oiseaux |location=Bruxelles |publisher=Institut des Parcs Nationaux du Congo Belge |url=http://biblio.naturalsciences.be/rbins-publications/institut-des-parcs-nationaux-du-congo/exploration-du-parc-national-albert-exploratie-van-het-nationaal-albert-park-mission-zending-g-f-de-witte-1933-1935/9-1938-mission-zending-g-f-de-witte-1933-1935/irscnb_p4137_00f8d8p_09_corps-de-texte-red.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frechkop1943&gt;{{cite book |author=Frechkop, S. |year=1943 |title=Exploration du Parc National Albert: Mammifères |location=Bruxelles |publisher=Institut des Parcs Nationaux du Congo Belge |url=http://biblio.naturalsciences.be/rbins-publications/institut-des-parcs-nationaux-du-congo/exploration-du-parc-national-albert-exploratie-van-het-nationaal-albert-park/1-1943-mission-s-mammiferes/irscnb_s2073_00fc5ax_1-core-red.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; explored the ethnic groups in this area;&lt;ref name=Schumacher1943&gt;{{cite book |author=Schumacher, P. |title=Die Kivu-Pygmäen und ihre soziale Umwelt im Albert-National Park |year=1943 |location=Bruxelles |publisher=Institut des Parcs Nationaux du Congo Belge |url=http://biblio.naturalsciences.be/rbins-publications/institut-des-parcs-nationaux-du-congo/exploration-du-parc-national-albert-exploratie-van-het-nationaal-albert-park-mission-zending-p-schumacher-1933-1936/1-1943-mission-p-schumacher/irscnb_p4143_rbins19135_1-5-90-red.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied volcanic activity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Verhoogen, J. |year=1948 |title=Les éruptions 1938-1940 du volcan Nyamuragira |location=Bruxelles |publisher=Institut des Parcs Nationaux du Congo Belge |url=http://biblio.naturalsciences.be/rbins-publications/institut-des-parcs-nationaux-du-congo/exploration-du-parc-national-albert-exploratie-van-het-nationaal-albert-park-mission-zending-j-verhoogen-1938-et-1940/1-1948-mission-j-verhoogen-les-eruptions-1938-1940-du-volcan-nyamuragira/irscnb_p4142_rbins19133_1-5-130-part-1-red.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[fossil]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=de Heinzelin de Braucourt, J. |year=1961 |title=Le paléolithique aux abords d'Ishango |location=Bruxelles |publisher=Institut des Parcs Nationaux du Congo Belge |url=http://biblio.naturalsciences.be/rbins-publications/institut-des-parcs-nationaux-du-congo/exploration-du-parc-national-albert-exploratie-van-het-nationaal-albert-park-mission-zending-j-de-heinzelin-de-braucourt-1950/6-1961-mission-zending-j-de-heinzelin-de-braucourt-1950/irscnb_c23707_009a2cb_6-corps-de-texte-red.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s, encroaching Tutsi herders and their [[cattle]] destroyed natural habitat inside the park up to an altitude of {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, threatening the food base of the park’s gorillas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dart, R.A. |year=1960 |title=The urgency of international intervention for the preservation of the mountain gorilla |journal=South African Journal of Science |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=85–87 |url=https://journals.co.za/content/sajsci/56/4/AJA00382353_8871?crawler=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Land laws were reformed in the 1960s after the country became independent, and the land declared property of the state, much to the disadvantage of local people. Illegal hunting inside protected areas increased.&lt;ref name=Inogwabini/&gt;
In 1969, the two parks were merged under the name Virunga National Park and enlisted as [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=Crawford2008/&gt;
&lt;!--Virunga fared well for the better part of the 1970s. Foreign investment helped to improve the park's [[infrastructure]] and training facilities, and the park became a popular tourist destination, with an average 6500 visitors a year.&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt; --&gt;

Since the early 1990s, the protected area was impacted by political turmoil in the [[African Great Lakes]] region. Following the [[Rwandan genocide]], thousands of [[refugee]]s fled to the [[Kivu]] region and presence of military increased. The [[First Congo War|First]] and [[Second Congo War]]s further destabilised the region. Anti-[[poaching]] patrols inside the park were obstructed, park personnel and wildlife killed.&lt;ref name=Debonnet2004/&gt; About 850,000 refugees lived around the national park in 1994. Up to 40,000 people entered the park daily in search of firewood and food, and deforested huge areas.&lt;ref name=McNeely2003&gt;{{cite journal |author=McNeely, J.A. |year=2003 |title=Conserving forest biodiversity in times of violent conflict |journal=Oryx |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=142–152 |doi=10.1017/S0030605303000334}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Virunga National Park was entered into the List of World Heritage in Danger.&lt;ref name=Debonnet2004/&gt;
In 1996, the national park was enlisted as a [[Ramsar site of international importance]].&lt;ref name=Crawford2008/&gt;

In 2005, the [[European Commission]] (EC) recommended a [[public-private partnership]] between the country’s government and the British [[non-governmental organisation]] [[Virunga Foundation|African Conservation Fund]]. Latter organisation is responsible for park management since 2010; about 80% of management costs are subsidised by the EC. Park protection efforts were militarized in the following years to deter armed rebel groups and poachers from operating inside the park.&lt;ref name=Marijnen2018&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marijnen, E. |year=2018 |title=Public Authority and Conservation in Areas of Armed Conflict: Virunga National Park as a ‘State within a State’ in Eastern Congo |journal=Development and Change |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=790–814 |doi=10.1111/dech.12380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the British company [[Soco International]] was granted a concession for extracting [[crude oil]] in the surroundings of and in large parts of the national park. Government officials supported exploration activities by Soco International mission members, whereas park management opposed. In the course of increasing tensions, the park's chief warden [[Emmanuel de Mérode]] was assailed in April 2014.&lt;ref name=Marijnen2018/&gt;
Following international protests, the company stopped exploring activities and consented to refrain from starting similar operations in the vicinity of World Heritage sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nkongolo, J.K. |year=2015 |title=International solidarity and permanent sovereignty over natural resources: antagonism or peaceful coexistence?

=== Armed conflict ===
After the Second Congo War was over, confrontations between park personnel and rebel groups continued; 80 park staff were killed between 1996 and 2003.&lt;ref name=McNeely2003/&gt;
Several armed rebel groups operate in the park, including [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda]] and [[National Congress for the Defence of the People]].&lt;ref name=Crawford2008/&gt;

They generate income by levying fees from local people for protecting prohibited activities inside the national park like poaching and clandestine [[fishing]], [[logging]], producing and [[smuggling]] [[charcoal]], but also through armed robberies and [[kidnapping]]. In 2010, the [[United Nations Security Council]] estimated that the charcoal trade represents an annual value of US$ 28–30 million.

Virunga National Park is located in the [[Congo River|Congo]] − [[Nile River|Nile]] watershed area. Its northern sector encompasses part of the Semliki River basin, as well as [[savanna]] and [[Albertine Rift montane forests|montane forest of the Albertine Rift]].&lt;ref name=Mubalama2004/&gt;
In altitude, this sector ranges from {{convert|680|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the Puemba River valley to the highest peak of [[Mount Stanley]] at {{convert|5109|m|ft|abbr=on}} within {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The national park’s central sector encompasses about two third of [[Lake Edward]] up to the international border with Uganda in the east. A narrow corridor of {{convert|3|-|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} width along the lake’s western bank connects the northern and southern sectors of the national park. The southern sector stretches to the shores of [[Lake Kivu]] and encompasses Nyamulagira, Nyiragongo and [[Mikeno]] volcanoes with [[montane forests]] on their slopes.&lt;ref name=Crawford2008/&gt;

The northern sector of Virunga National Park is contiguous with Uganda’s [[Semuliki National Park|Semuliki]] and [[Rwenzori Mountains National Park]]s, and the central sector with [[Queen Elizabeth National Park]]. The southern sector borders Ruanda’s [[Volcanoes National Park]].&lt;ref name=Plumptre_al2012&gt;{{cite book |authors=Plumptre, A.

J. |pages=88–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
The climate in the Albertine Rift is influenced by the movement of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] and the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]]. March to mid May and September to November are the main rainy seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Seimon, A. and Phillipps, G. P. |year=2012 |chapter=Regional Climatology of the Albertine Rift |title=Long Term changes in Africa’s Rift Valley: impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems |publisher=Nova Science Publishers |location=New York |editor=Plumptre, A. J. |pages=18–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mean monthly rainfall in the savanna around Lake Edward is {{convert|30-40|mm|in|abbr=on}}; this is the driest part of the landscape. The northern sector receives a monthly mean precipitation of up to {{convert|220|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the southern sector of up to {{convert|160|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Plumptre_al2012/&gt;
Average temperatures in lower altitudes vary from {{convert|23-28|C}}, and in higher altitudes from {{convert|16-24|C}}, rarely dropping below {{convert|14|C}}.&lt;ref name=Bashonga2012/&gt;

=== Flora ===
Virunga National Park's [[flora]] encompasses 2,077 plant species, including 264 [[tree]] species and 230 plants that are endemic to the Albertine Rift.&lt;ref name=Plumptre_al2007/&gt;
The plains of Virunga National Park are dominated by [[wetland]]s and [[grassland]]s with [[papyrus sedge]] (''Cyperus papyrus''), [[jointed flatsedge]] (''C. articulatus''), [[common reed]] (''Phragmites mauritanica''), [[sacaton grass]]es (''Sporobolus consimilis''), [[ambatch]] (''Aeschynomene elaphroxylon''), [[conkerberry]] (''Carissa spinarum''), [[paperbark thorn]] (''Vachellia sieberiana'') and [[kowai fruit]] (''Coccinia grandis'').&lt;ref name=Ramsar94/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mubalama2000&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mubalama, L. |year=2000 |title=Population and Distribution of Elephants (''Loxodonta africana africana'') in the Central Sector of the Virunga National Park, Eastern DRC |journal=Pachyderm |volume=28 |issue= |pages=44–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Remains of [[dicots]] such as [[African caper]] (''Capparis tomentosa''), ''[[Maerua]]'' species, wild [[cucurbits]] and [[nightshades]] were found in dung balls of [[African elephant]]s (''Loxodonta'') that play a significant role for [[seed dispersal]] in the grasslands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brahmachary, R.L. |year=1980 |title=On the germination of seeds in the dung balls of the African elephant in the Virunga National Park |journal=Revue d'Ecologie La Terre et la Vie |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=139–142 |url=http://documents.irevues.inist.fr/bitstream/handle/2042/54997/LATERREETLAVIE_1980_34_1_139.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The montane forest between {{convert|1800|and|2800|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the southern sector is dominated by ''[[Ficalhoa laurifolia]]'' and ''[[Podocarpus milanjianus]]'' with up to {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} high trees. [[African alpine bamboo]] (''Yushania alpina'') grows at altitudes of {{convert|2300|-|2600|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The vegetation above {{convert|2600|m|ft|abbr=on}} is subalpine with foremost [[African redwood]] (''Hagenia abyssinica'') growing up to {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. [[Tree heath]] (''Erica arborea''), [[Ericaceae|heather]] and [[mosses]] cover humid slopes up to {{convert|3700|m|ft|abbr=on}} altitude. ''[[Senecio]]'' and ''[[Lobelia]]'' species grow on vast clearings and attain heights of up to {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Bashonga2012/&gt;

'''VoxForge''' is a [[Free software|free]] [[speech corpus]] and [[Acoustic Model|acoustic model]] repository for [[open source]] [[speech recognition]] engines.

VoxForge was set up to collect transcribed speech to create a free [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] speech corpus for use with open source speech recognition engines. The speech audio files will be 'compiled' into acoustic models for use with open source speech recognition engines such as [[Julius (software)|Julius]], [http://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/speech ISIP], and [[CMU Sphinx|Sphinx]] and [[HTK (software)|HTK]] (note: HTK has distribution restrictions).

VoxForge has&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voxforge.org/home/forums/message-boards/acoustic-model-discussions/librivox-data Forum post on voxforge.org]&lt;/ref&gt; used [[LibriVox]] as a source of audio data since 2007.

'''The war of the languages''' ({{lang-he|מלחמת השפות}}; ''Milhemet HaSafot'') was a heated debate in [[History of Palestine#Ottoman era|Ottoman Palestine]] over the language of instruction in the country's new [[Jewish]] schools. This "language war" was a cornerstone event in the history of the [[revival of the Hebrew language]].
==History==
In 1913, the German Jewish aid agency ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Hilfsverein der deutschen Juden|de}}'', which had maintained schools for Jewish immigrants in Palestine since 1905, sought to establish [[German language|German]] as the language of instruction at the first technical high school, the Technikum, in [[Haifa]] (later, the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology|Technion]]), which it was sponsoring.&lt;ref&gt;Spolsky, Bernard, and Elana Shohamy (2001). "[https://books.google.com/books?id=NEulLJm9dqQC&amp;pg=PA169 The Penetration of English as Language of Science and Technology into the Israeli Linguistic Repertoire: A Preliminary Inquiry]", in: Ulrich Ammon (Ed.), ''The Dominance of English as a Language of Science: Effects on Other Languages and Language Communities''. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter. {{ISBN|311016647X}}. p.&amp;nbsp;167-176; here: p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kremer, Arndt (January 30, 2015). "[http://m.bpb.de/apuz/199904/brisante-sprache-deutsch-in-palaestina-und-israel?p=all Brisante Sprache? Deutsch in Palästina und Israel]" {{de icon}}. Section "Frühe Siedlungen, erste Kontroversen". ''Aus Politik und Zeitgeschichte''. Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung. www.bpb.de. Retrieved 2016-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; This sparked a public controversy between those who supported the use of German and those who believed that  [[Hebrew]] should be the language spoken by the Jewish people in their homeland. The issue was not just ideological: until then, Hebrew was primarily a liturgical language and lacked modern technical terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vosizneias.com/49624/2010/02/17/israel-how-german-built-the-hebrew-language How German built the Hebrew language]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Youth in the Dominican Republic''' constitutes just over 30% of the total population. The [[Dominican Republic]]'s population at roughly eleven million people has grown tremendously with the help of the youth population. In 1960, the youth population was at 3.3 million, and by 2008, it had reached 9.5 million, with two thirds of them in urban areas of the country.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = USAID/Dominican Republic Cross-Sectoral At-Risk Youth Assessment|last = |first = |publisher = Education Development Center, Inc|year = 2010|isbn = |location = Newton, MA|pages = 1–72|url = http://www.equip123.net/docs/e3-DRAssessment.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dominican Republic is considered a middle-income country, and thrives economically through tourism and telecommunications.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Higher Education in the Dominican Republic: International Mobility and the Challenges of Expanding Domestic Provision - WENR|url = http://wenr.wes.org/2013/10/higher-education-in-the-dominican-republic-international-mobility-and-the-challenges-of-expanding-domestic-provision/|website = WENR|accessdate = 2015-11-15|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism is the single best revenue earner and over 25,000 youth are employed in this sector. Although tourism generates large revenues, some scholars and activists argue that the development of tourism has negative impacts on youth by keeping them from pursuing higher education.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Primary and secondary education are free to all citizens of the Dominican Republic. Higher education is free in the public sector, most notably at the [[Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo]], which enrolls 44% of the total tertiary student population.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The Dominican Republic is the only country that has a youth-only [[secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]]. In 2000, the country approved its General Youth Law, which allocates a budget of 1% of the national budget for the youth secretariat.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Caribbean Youth Development|last = |first = |publisher = The World Bank|year = 2003|isbn = 0-8213-5518-X|location = Washington, DC|pages = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The General Youth Law helps with youth development programs that promote education and development. The country also has multiple governmental laws that protect minors younger than eighteen years old from being arrested, legally processed, and going to jail.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Youth policy and law ==
Youth in the Dominican Republic face challenges to participating fully and positively in society.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Ministry of Youth and the General Youth Law of 2000 pinpoints Youth Civic Participation as an important part of promoting youth development and well-being.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dominican Republic|url = http://www.icicp.org/resource-library/icp-publications/global-youth-service-database/americas/caribbean/dominican-republic/|website = Innovations in Civic Participation|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The General Youth Law has a national education-based policy that requires high school students to complete sixty hours of service as a prerequisite of graduation.

The Law for the System of Protection regulates the treatment of minors from birth to age 18. This law states that children under the age of 13 are not criminally liable, while youth ages 13–18 are.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The electoral participation rate in the Dominican Republic is higher than the Latin America average, as over 77.3 percent indicated they had voted in the last election.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dominican Republic {{!}} Factsheets {{!}} Youthpolicy.org|url = http://www.youthpolicy.org/factsheets/country/dominican-republic/|website = www.youthpolicy.org|accessdate = 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Younger residents between the ages of 18-25 had a 29.2 percent voting rate, compared to 75.6 percent in the 26-35 year age range.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Youth Civic Participation Programs attempt to foster youths' positive civic participation and reduce negative and illegal behaviors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other programs are available to help youth obtain birth certificates and identity documents. As of 2006, there were 17,000 children and youth who have been issued birth certificates, allowing them to attend school and vote in elections.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Youth in the Dominican Republic tend to distrust government officials and institutions because they feel exploited. They tend to fear the judicial process; afraid jail will hinder them from reaching adulthood.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Young adults in the Dominican Republic say that they believe they have a negative image in society, but ultimately just want their voices heard by older members of the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some organizations that seek to empower young people with the specific intent that they will go out and further empower their communities are Fundacion Sur Adelante and the Callegjera-Action Educational Foundation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; These organizations work with the youth population to mobilize them to become change agents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They also provide them with access to libraries, computers, and law services to allow them the awareness they need to better organize themselves for the future.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There are also set policies that help youth improve their creative and innovative skills for the workforce and reducing barriers that could limit their access to the labor market.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These policies are responsible for detecting and removing children from child labor, while also ensuring compliance with labor rights.

== Employment ==
Youth face difficulties when entering the labor market and have unemployment rates considerably higher than adults.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2008, youth ages 10–24 represented 24% of the total labor force in the Dominican Republic, and 43% of the total unemployed population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unemployment in the Dominican Republic appears to be in a slight but steady increase of 14.3 percent since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Bank report highlights Dominican Republic Youth Employment Program|url = http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2013/12/12/informe-banco-mundial-destaca-programa-juventud-empleo-republica-dominicana|website = www.worldbank.org|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unbalanced market of supply and demand limits the number of jobs available to youth. Skill gaps prove to be another obstacle to the youth and jobs are too complex for youth just out of high school or college.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The lack of counseling services available to youth often prohibit them from obtaining jobs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Agriculture is the primary source of employment for youth in rural areas while wholesale and retail trade is the primary source of employment for youth in urban areas. Over 75% of the youth labor force is concentrated in five activities: wholesale and retail trade, other services, manufacturing, hotels, bars and restaurants, and agriculture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Self-employment is also a popular option among all age groups in the Dominican Republic. It has increased from 34% in 1991 to about 43% in 2011, leading to a measured increase in familiarity and comfort when working.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Republica-Dominicana|url = http://www.youthneo.org/Republica-Dominicana.aspx|website = www.youthneo.org|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The labor force participation is lower among young women due to gender stereotypes, which causes them to rely on self-employment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2007, the average wage for women was 87% of the average wage for men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One program available for youth trying to find employment is "Quesqueya believes in you" or NEO in the Dominican Republic, which is a program designed to increase job opportunities for low-income people, aged 15–29, living in urban areas of thirteen of the country's provinces.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another program available is Espacios para Emprender (EpE), which is designed to equip 14-17 year old adolescents with the strategies required to find a job or establish a micro-enterprise.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Work and education, combined early in life, often burden youth. Some youth believe that relocating to a larger city would benefit them and provide more opportunity in the work force.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Youth Poverty in the Dominican Republic: the dis-empowered next generation|last = Borho|first = Linda|date = 2012|journal = Master Thesis- University of Agder|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime ==
In 2011, poverty levels were around 40.4%, compared to 32% in 2000.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Youth at Risk in Latin America and the Caribbean: Understanding the Causes, Realizing the Potential|last = Cunningham|first = Wendy|publisher = The World Bank|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-8213-7520-4|location = Washington, D.C.|pages = 35–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank 2006 study conducted a study on youth violence in the Caribbean and the primary motivation identified for committing a crime was the desire to escape poverty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The scarcity of resources may push young people into unsustainable and dangerous survival activities often creating violent neighborhoods. In Latin America and the Caribbean, it is estimated that over 50% of the population between 12–24 years is at-risk in participating in illegal and dangerous activities.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Youth in the Dominican Republic can find a sense of social support in gangs.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dominican Republic: Foreign Policy and Government Guide|last = |first = |publisher = International Business Publications|year = 2014|isbn = 1-4387-1445-9|location = Washington, D.C.|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many youth experiencing poverty can be excluded by the wider Dominican society, and gangs are sometimes the only option of acceptance. In the 2012 [[Latin American Public Opinion Project]] survey, the Dominican Republic was ranked first of all the Latin American countries, as 48.6% of neighborhoods reported to being affected by gangs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Members of gangs often participate in drug use and fight out of boredom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Life on the Malecon: Children and Youth on the Streets of Santo Domingo|last = Wolseth|first = Jon|publisher = Rutgers University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-8135-6288-9|location = |pages = 183–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many young people, a gang is a social participation space, a system of values in which individual and group identities are affirmed through new communication codes and forms of authority that are different from those that exist in the world of formal institutions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Education ==
[[Education in the Dominican Republic]] is free and compulsory at the elementary level, and free but not mandatory at the secondary level. Basic education enrollment is 89%, while secondary education enrollment is lower at 50%, as some youth face different constraints to accessing education at this level.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Around 55% of children and adolescents do not attend school because their right to enter the system is denied. This restricted access to education affects children who do not have documents, which includes children who were born in the country to undocumented Dominican parents and children of Haitian parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UNICEF Dominican Republic - Knowledge Management - The Right to Education|url = http://www.unicef.org/republicadominicana/english/advocacy_partnerships_15926.htm|website = www.unicef.org|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Typical Dominican school children.jpg|thumb|A group of Dominican children at primary school. |left]]

Many Haitians migrate to the Dominican Republic increasing the youth population in the school systems. There was an increase of Haitians in the Dominican Republic after an earthquake struck the island in 2010, killing over 200,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 7.0 quake hits Haiti; 'Serious loss of life' expected  - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/01/12/haiti.earthquake/|website = www.cnn.com|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overcrowding is one problem that schools face, especially in urban settings. In public schools with 500 students or more (accounting for 68% of total enrollment), the student-teacher ratio is 78:1 (clarify this).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Teachers are not able to work with individual students. Youth spend almost ten years in school, but make progress very slowly because they have to repeat grades. 12.4% of youth repeat the first three grades in urban areas, while 7.7% repeat grades in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Education Sector in the Dominican Republic: Overachievements and Underperformance|last = Ripani|first = Laura|publisher = |year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = 8–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 25,000 youth ages 15–19 characterized themselves as unable to read or write.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Teachers in the Dominican Republic may only understand around 40% of the material they are teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dominican Republic revamps failing education system {{!}} Globalization {{!}} DW.COM {{!}} 12.05.2014|url = http://www.dw.com/en/dominican-republic-revamps-failing-education-system/a-17625149|website = DW.COM|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health ==
In the Dominican Republic, the population ages 15–24 are documented as the healthiest age group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One issue in the health sector is sexual health. 15% of females and 24% of males ages 15–24 reported have their first sexual relation before age 15.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The proportion of youth who have sex at a young age was inversely related to both education and income. Youth that were sexually active early in life had dropped out of school earlier that those who had waited to engage in sexual activity.

Fewer than half of the female population that were sexually active used contraception.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because of the limited use of contraception, the Dominican Republic has one of the highest HIV/AIDS rates outside the country of Africa.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Females are more susceptible to HIV and AIDS given that they are more likely to engage in commercial sex work compared to males.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Code for the System of Protection and Fundamental Rights of Children and Adolescents guarantees the rights to health and health services for children and adolescents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The General Law of Health ensures that these rights are preserved for youth, women, senior citizens, and the disabled.

82% of males ages 15–19 and 73.5% of females reported having consumed alcohol sometime in the prior three months.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although the legal drinking age is eighteen, many young adults begin consuming before that.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
