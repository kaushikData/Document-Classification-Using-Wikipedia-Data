'''''A Grand Night for Singing''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] revue showcasing the music of [[Richard Rodgers]] and the lyrics of [[Oscar Hammerstein II]].

Featuring songs from such lesser-known works as ''[[Allegro (musical)|Allegro]]'', ''[[Me and Juliet]]'', ''[[State Fair (musical)|State Fair]]'', and ''[[Pipe Dream (musical)|Pipe Dream]]'', modest successes like ''[[Flower Drum Song]]'' and hits like ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', ''[[The King and I]]'', ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', it originally was presented [[cabaret]]-style at Rainbow &amp; Stars at the top of [[Rockefeller Center]].

After 41 previews, the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, directed by [[Walter Bobbie]] (who wrote the minimal book linking the tunes) and [[choreographed]] by [[Pamela Sousa]], with vocal arrangements by Fred Wells and orchestrations by [[Michael Gibson (musician)|Michael Gibson]] and [[Jonathan Tunick]], opened on November 17, 1993, at the [[Criterion Center Stage Right]], where it ran for 52 performances. [[Victoria Clark]], [[Jason Graae]], [[Alyson Reed]], [[Martin Vidnovic]], and [[Lynne Wintersteller]] comprised the cast. Martin Vidnovic is replaced by [[Gregg Edelman]] in the cast recording, and some later performances.

It was nominated for two [[Tony Award]]s, for Best Musical and Best Book of a Musical, and the [[Drama Desk Award]] for Outstanding Revue.

An [[cast album|original cast recording]] was released by [[Varèse Sarabande]].

'''''Alice in Wonderland''''' is a 2010 American [[dark fantasy]] [[adventure film]] directed by [[Tim Burton]] from a screenplay written by [[Linda Woolverton]]. The film stars [[Johnny Depp]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], [[Crispin Glover]], [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] and [[Mia Wasikowska]], and features the voices of [[Alan Rickman]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Michael Sheen]], and [[Timothy Spall]]. Loosely inspired by [[Lewis Carroll]]'s fantasy novels, ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', the film tells the story of a nineteen-year-old [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice Kingsleigh]], who is told that she can restore the [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]] to her throne, with the help of the [[Hatter (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Mad Hatter]]. She is the only one who can slay the [[Jabberwocky|Jabberwock]], a dragon-like creature that is controlled by the [[Red Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|Red Queen]] and terrorizes Underland's inhabitants.

The film was produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and shot in the United Kingdom and the United States. The film premiered in London at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on February 25, 2010, and was released in Australia on March 4, 2010, and the following day in the United Kingdom and the United States through the [[Disney Digital 3-D|Disney Digital 3D]], [[RealD 3D]], and [[IMAX 3D]] formats as well as in conventional theaters. It is also the [[2010 in film|second-highest-grossing film of 2010.]]

''Alice in Wonderland'' received mixed reviews upon release; although praised for its visual style and special effects, the film was criticized for its lack of narrative coherence and overuse of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). The film received three nominations at the [[68th Golden Globe Awards]], including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture&amp;nbsp;– Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy]]. At the [[83rd Academy Awards]], ''Alice in Wonderland'' won [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], and was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. The film generated over $1 billion in ticket sales and became the [[List of highest-grossing films|fifth-highest-grossing film of all time]] during its theatrical run.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;Corliss, Richard (May 13, 2012).

The film started [[List of Disney live-action adaptation of animated films|a trend of live-action fairy tale and fantasy films]] being green-lit, particularly from [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]].

==Plot==
Troubled by a strange recurring dream and mourning the loss of her father, 19-year-old [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice Kingsleigh]] attends a garden party at Lord Ascot's estate. There, she is confronted by an unwanted marriage proposal to Lord Ascot's son, Hamish, and the stifling expectations of the society in which she lives. Unsure of how to proceed, she pursues a rabbit wearing a blue waistcoat and accidentally falls into a large rabbit hole under a tree. She emerges in a forest where she is greeted by the [[White Rabbit]], [[the Dormouse]], the [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dodo]], the [[List of minor characters in the Alice series#Live Flowers|Talking Flowers]], and [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee]]. They argue over whether Alice is "the right Alice" who must slay the [[Red Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|Red Queen]]'s [[Jabberwocky]] and restore the [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]] to power, as foretold by [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Absolem the Caterpillar]] and his prophetic scroll. The group is then ambushed by the [[Bandersnatch]] and a group of playing-card soldiers led by the [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]]. Alice, Tweedledum and Tweedledee escape into the woods. The Knave steals the Caterpillar's scroll. The Dormouse leaves the others behind with one of the Bandersnatch's eyes in her possession. Tweedledum and Tweedledee are then captured by the Red Queen's [[Jubjub bird]].

The Knave informs the Red Queen that Alice threatens her reign, and the soldiers and [[Puppy (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Bayard the Bloodhound]] are ordered to find Alice immediately. Meanwhile, the [[Cheshire Cat]] guides Alice to the [[March Hare]] and the [[Hatter (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Mad Hatter]]. The Hatter helps Alice avoid capture by allowing himself to be seized instead. Later, Alice is found by the Bloodhound, but Alice insists upon helping the Hatter. At the Red Queen's citadel and palace, the Red Queen is unaware of Alice's true identity and therefore welcomes her as a guest. Alice learns that the [[vorpal sword]], the only weapon capable of killing the Jabberwocky, is locked inside the den of the Bandersnatch. The Knave attempts to seduce Alice, but she rebuffs him, causing a jealous Red Queen to order that Alice be beheaded. Alice obtains the sword and befriends the Bandersnatch by returning its eye. She then escapes on the back of the grateful Bandersnatch and delivers the sword to the White Queen. The Cheshire Cat saves the Hatter from the [[List of minor characters in the Alice series#The Executioner|executioner]], and the Hatter calls for rebellion against the Red Queen. The rebellion is quickly put down by the Jubjub bird, but the resistance flees to the White Queen's castle, and both armies prepare for battle. Absolem advises Alice to fight the Jabberwocky just before completing his transformation into a [[pupa]].

On the appointed day, the White Queen and the Red Queen gather their armies on a chessboard-like battlefield and send Alice and the Jabberwocky to decide the battle in single combat. Encouraged by the advice of her late father, Alice fights the Jabberwocky among the ruins surrounding the battlefield and finally jumps from the remains of a spiral staircase onto the Jabberwocky's neck and beheads it. During this fight, a catapult stone kills the Jubjub bird. As punishment for their crimes, the White Queen banishes the Red Queen and the Knave into exile together. The Knave attempts to kill the Red Queen, yet the Hatter protects the Red Queen from his attack. After the Hatter performs a celebration dance called Futterwacken, the White Queen gives Alice a vial of the Jabberwocky's purple blood whose power will bring her whatever she wishes. She decides to rejoin the everyday world after saying farewell to her friends. Back in England, Alice impresses Lord Ascot with her idea of establishing oceanic trade routes to [[Hong Kong]], inspiring him to take her as his apprentice. As the story closes, Alice prepares to set off on a trading ship. A light-blue butterfly with dark vein markings lands on her shoulder, and Alice recognizes him as Absolem.

While he follows the Red Queen's every order, he is the only one capable of calming her dramatic mood swings. Glover said, "The Red Queen has a fair amount of short-tempered reactions to things that people do, and so [the Knave] has to be quite diplomatic." The Red Queen believes that the Knave of Hearts is her lover, but this proves to be false.

==Production==
[[Tim Burton]] signed with [[Walt Disney Pictures]] to direct two films in [[Disney Digital 3-D|Disney Digital 3D]], which included ''Alice in Wonderland''&lt;ref name="Graser"/&gt; and [[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|his remake of ''Frankenweenie'']]. Burton developed the story because he never felt an emotional tie to [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|the original book]].&lt;ref name="Ryder"/&gt;

He explained "the goal is to try to make it an engaging movie where you get some of the psychology and kind of bring a freshness but also keep the classic nature of ''Alice''." On prior versions, Burton said "It was always a girl wandering around from one crazy character to another, and I never really felt any real emotional connection." His goal with the new film is to give the story "some framework of emotional grounding" and "to try and make ''Alice'' feel more like a story as opposed to a series of events."&lt;ref name="sdcc09"/&gt; Burton focused on the poem "[[Jabberwocky]]" as part of his structure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Katie |last=Hasty |url=http://www.hitfix.com/articles/2009-7-23-comic-con-tim-burton-talks-alice-and-the-jabberwocky-taking-on-dark-shadows |title=Comic-Con: Tim Burton talks ''Alice'' and the Jabberwocky, taking on "Dark Shadows" |work=Hitfix |date=July 23, 2009 |accessdate=December 25, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGSdtpkH?url=http://www.hitfix.com/articles/2009-7-23-comic-con-tim-burton-talks-alice-and-the-jabberwocky-taking-on-dark-shadows |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the described creature by the name of the poem rather than by the name "Jabberwock" used in the poem. Burton also stated that he does not see his version as either a sequel to any existing ''Alice'' film nor as a "re-imagining".&lt;ref name="Ryder"/&gt; However, the idea of the climax of the story being Alice's battle with the Queen's champion, the Jabberwocky, was first added in the video game ''[[American McGee's Alice]]'', and the landscape, tower, weapons and appearance of Alice in those scenes of the film are very reminiscent of the same scenes in the game.

Two hundred and fifty local [[extra (actor)|extras]] were chosen in early August. Locations included [[Antony House]] in Torpoint, [[Charlestown, Cornwall]] and [[Barbican, Plymouth|the Barbican]],&lt;ref name="Burton brings Hollywood to Cornwall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Plymouth in Wonderland"/&gt; however, no footage from the Barbican was used.

[[Sony Pictures Imageworks]] designed the visual effects sequences.&lt;ref name="Johnny Depp in deep with Disney"/&gt; Burton felt 3D was appropriate to the story's environment.&lt;ref name="confirm"/&gt; Burton and Zanuck chose to film with conventional cameras, and [[2D to 3D conversion|convert]] the footage into 3D during post-production; Zanuck explained 3D cameras were too expensive and "clumsy" to use, and they felt that there was no difference between converted footage and those shot in the format.&lt;ref name="Richard Zanuck and James Cameron spar over Alice in Wonderland"/&gt; [[James Cameron]], who released his 3D film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' in December 2009, criticized the choice, stating, "It doesn't make any sense to shoot in 2-D and convert to 3-D".&lt;ref name="James Cameron Criticizes Tim Burton and 3D DVD Releases"/&gt;

==Release==
On February 12, 2010, major UK cinema chains, [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon]], [[Vue Cinemas|Vue]], and [[Cineworld]], had planned to boycott the film because of a reduction of the interval between cinema and DVD [[film release|release]] from the usual 17 weeks to 12 (possibly to avoid the release of the DVD clashing with the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], which was Disney's pretext for cutting short ''Alice''{{'}}s theatrical run but UK exhibitors protested that Alice would be less threatened by the World Cup than other titles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a202872/uk-cinemas-plan-alice-boycott.html |title=Movies – News – UK cinemas plan ''Alice'' boycott |last=Reynolds |first=Simon |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi]] |date=February 12, 2010 |accessdate=February 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGSeFdi4?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a202872/uk-cinemas-plan-alice-boycott.html |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A week after the announcement, Cineworld, who has a 24% share of UK box office, chose to play the film on more than 150 screens. Cineworld's chief executive Steve Wiener stated, "As leaders in 3D, we did not want the public to miss out on such a visual spectacle. As the success of ''Avatar'' has shown, there is currently a huge appetite for the 3D experience".&lt;ref name="Cineworld backs off from Alice in Wonderland boycott" /&gt; Shortly after, the Vue cinema chain also reached an agreement with Disney, but Odeon had still chosen to boycott in Britain, Ireland, and Italy.&lt;ref name="odeon boycott" /&gt; On February 25, 2010 Odeon had reached an agreement and decided to show the film on March 5, 2010.&lt;ref name="Odeon makes U-turn on ''Alice'' boycott" /&gt; The Royal premiere took place at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in London on February 25, 2010 for the fundraiser [[Children &amp; the Arts|The Prince's Foundation for Children and The Arts]] where the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] and the [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Duchess of Cornwall]] attended.

On June 22, 2009, the first pictures of the film were released, showing Depp as the Mad Hatter, Hathaway as the White Queen, Bonham Carter as the Red Queen and Lucas as Tweedledee and Tweedledum.&lt;ref name="firstlook"/&gt; A new image of Alice was also released.&lt;ref name="''Alice in Wonderland'' Stills"/&gt; In July, new photos emerged of Alice holding a white rabbit, the Mad Hatter with a hare, the Red Queen holding a pig, and the White Queen with a mouse.&lt;ref name="Exclusive: New Alice In Wonderland Pic"/&gt;

On July 22, 2009, a [[Teaser campaign|teaser trailer]] from the Mad Hatter's point of view was released on [[IGN]] but was shortly taken down because Disney claimed that the trailer was not supposed to be out yet. The teaser was also planned to premiere along with a trailer of [[Robert Zemeckis]]' [[film adaptation]] of ''[[A Christmas Carol (2009 film)|A Christmas Carol]]'' on July 24, 2009 for ''[[G-Force (film)|G-Force]]''. The following day, the teaser trailer premiered at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] but the trailer shown was different from the one that leaked. The ComicCon version didn't have the Mad Hatter's dialogue. Instead, it featured "[[Time to Pretend]]" by [[MGMT]], and the clips shown were in different order than in the leaked version. The leaked version was originally to be shown to one of the three Facebook groups used to promote the film that had the most members. The groups used to promote the film are "The Loyal Subjects of the Red Queen", "The Loyal Subjects of the White Queen" and "The Disloyal Subjects of the Mad Hatter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedisneyblog.com/2009/07/21/be-the-first-to-see-the-alice-in-wonderland-teaser-trailer/ |title=Be The First To See The Alice In Wonderland Teaser Trailer! |last=Frost |first=John |publisher=The Disney Blog |date=July 21, 2009 |accessdate=July 21, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGSgUWVi?url=http://thedisneyblog.com/2009/07/21/be-the-first-to-see-the-alice-in-wonderland-teaser-trailer/ |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also at ComicCon, [[Theatrical property|props]] from the film were displayed in an "Alice in Wonderland" exhibit. Costumes featured in the exhibit included the Red Queen's dress, chair, wig, glasses, and scepter; the White Queen's dress, wig and a small model of her castle; the Mad Hatter's suit, hat, wig, chair and table; Alice's dress and battle armor (to slay the Jabberwocky). Other props included the "DRINK ME" bottles, the keys, an "EAT ME" pastry and stand-in models of the White Rabbit and March Hare.&lt;ref name="Alice in Wonderland Props Totally Rock at Comic Con"/&gt;

A nighttime party area at the [[Disney California Adventure]] theme park was created, called "[[Mad T Party]]".

===Critical reaction===
Review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 52% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 267 reviews; the average score is 5.7/10. The consensus is: "Tim Burton's ''Alice'' sacrifices the book's minimal narrative coherence—and much of its heart—but it's an undeniable visual treat".&lt;ref name="Alice in Wonderland (2010)3"/&gt; [[Metacritic]] rated it 53/100 based on 38 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/alice-in-wonderland|title=Alice in Wonderland|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=July 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised it for its "moments of delight, humor and bedazzlement", but went on to say, "But it also becomes more ordinary as it goes along, building to a generic battle climax similar to any number of others in CGI-heavy movies of the past few years".&lt;ref name="Alice in Wonderland Review"/&gt; Michael Rechtshaffen of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said "Burton has delivered a subversively witty, brilliantly cast, whimsically appointed dazzler that also manages to hit all the emotionally satisfying marks", while as well praising its [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), saying "Ultimately, it's the visual landscape that makes Alice's newest adventure so wondrous, as technology has finally been able to catch up with Burton's endlessly fertile imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film-reviews/alice-in-wonderland-film-review-1004071135.story? |title=Alice in Wonderland – Film Review |last=Rechtshaffen |first=Michael |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media]] |date=February 25, 2010 |accessdate=February 26, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302144251/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film-reviews/alice-in-wonderland-film-review-1004071135.story |archivedate=March 2, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said, "But Burton's Disneyfied 3-D ''Alice in Wonderland'', written by the girl-power specialist Linda Woolverton, is a strange brew indeed: murky, diffuse, and meandering, set not in a Wonderland that pops with demented life but in a world called Underland that's like a joyless, bombed-out version of Wonderland. It looks like a CGI head trip gone post apocalyptic. In the film's rather humdrum 3-D, the place doesn't dazzle—it droops."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20348226,00.html |title=Alice in Wonderland (2010) – Movie Review |date=March 3, 2010 |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |authorlink=Owen Gleiberman |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGSkPOEA?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20348226,00.html |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film three out of four stars and wrote in his review that, "''Alice'' plays better as an adult hallucination, which is how Burton rather brilliantly interprets it until a pointless third act flies off the rails."&lt;ref name="Alice in Wonderland Review4"/&gt; The market research firm [[CinemaScore]] found that audiences gave the film an average rating of "A-".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ben |last=Fritz |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/03/alice-in-wonderland-opens-to-record-setting-210-million.html |title=First look: ''Alice in Wonderland'' opens to record-setting $210 million |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |date=March 7, 2010 |accessdate=March 7, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGSlPue0?url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/03/alice-in-wonderland-opens-to-record-setting-210-million.html |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reviews criticized the decision to turn Alice into a "colonialist entrepreneur" at the end of the film setting sail for China.&lt;ref name="Alice in Wonderland review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="''Alice in Wonderland in Digital 3-D'' clowns paying audience"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alice in Wonderland review5"/&gt; Given Britain's role in the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s during the [[Victorian era]] and the foreign domination of China through "[[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]]", China expert Kevin Slaten writes, "Not only is it troubling imagery, for a female role model in a Disney movie, but it's also a celebration of the exploitation that China suffered for a century."&lt;ref name="Who else might be mad at Alice? China"/&gt;

Game developer [[American McGee]], best known for creating ''[[American McGee's Alice|Alice]]'' and ''[[Alice: Madness Returns]]'', was asked in a 2011 interview about Tim Burton's interpretation of the title character since both versions share almost similar dark and twisted tone of Wonderland. McGee praised the film's visuals and audio but criticized the lack of screen time Alice had compared to the other characters. He felt Alice did not have any purpose in the story and that she was merely used as a "tool".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Douglas|first1=Jane|title=Alice: Madness Returns Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8j6-jiyHCE|website=YouTube|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the musical term|the saxophone|Alto sax}}
{{other uses|Alto (disambiguation)}}
The musical term '''alto''', meaning "high" in [[Wikt:alto#Italian|Italian]] ([[Latin]]: '''''[[Wikt:altus|altus]]'''''), refers to the second highest [[Part (music)|part]] of a [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] musical texture and is also applied to its associated [[vocal range]], especially in [[choir|choral]] music. It is also the root word of [[contralto]], the lowest standard female voice type. When designating instruments, "alto" likewise can refer either to the corresponding vocal range ([[alto flute]] and [[alto trombone]]) or to musical role ([[Recorder (musical instrument)#Types of recorder|alto recorder]] and [[alto clarinet]]).  The term "alto" is also used to designate a specific kind of musical [[clef]]; see [[alto clef]].

==Etymology==
In [[choral music]] for [[SATB|mixed voices]], "alto" describes the lowest part commonly sung by women. The explanation for the anomaly of this name is to be found not in the use of adult [[falsetto|falsettists]] in choirs of men and [[boy soprano|boys]] but further back in innovations in composition during the mid-[[Renaissance music#Early Renaissance music|15th century]]. Before this time it was usual to write a melodic ''cantus'' or ''[[superius]]'' against a [[tenor]] (from Latin ''tenere'', to hold) or 'held' part, to which might be added a [[contratenor]], which was in [[counterpoint]] with (in other words, against = contra) the tenor. The composers of [[Ockeghem]]'s generation wrote two contratenor parts and designated them as ''contratenor altus'' and ''contratenor bassus''; they were respectively higher and lower than the tenor part. From these derive both the modern terms "alto" (and contralto) and "[[Bass (voice type)|bass]]".

== In choral music ==
{{Choral voice classification}}
In [[SATB|SATB four-part mixed]] chorus, the alto is the second highest vocal range, above the [[tenor]] and [[bass (voice type)|bass]] and below the [[soprano]]. The alto range in choral music is approximately from [[Scientific pitch notation|F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] (the F below middle C) to F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (the F in the second octave above middle C). In common usage, alto is used to describe the [[voice type]] that typically sings this part, though this is not strictly correct. Alto, like the other three standard modern choral voice classifications ([[soprano]], [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]]) was originally intended to describe a part within a homophonic or polyphonic texture, rather than an individual voice type;&lt;ref&gt;Stark (2003), Bel Canto: A History of Vocal Pedagogy&lt;/ref&gt; neither are the terms alto and [[contralto]] interchangeable or synonymous, though they are often treated as such.

Although some women who sing alto in a choir are contraltos, many would be more accurately called [[mezzo-soprano]]s (a voice of somewhat higher range and different [[timbre]]), and many male [[countertenor]]s (this latter term is a source of considerable controversy, some authorities preferring the usage of the term "male alto" for those countertenors who use a predominantly [[falsetto]] voice production).

The contralto voice is a matter of vocal timbre and [[tessitura]] as well as range, and a classically trained solo contralto would usually have a range greater than that of a normal choral alto part in both the upper and lower ranges. However, the vocal tessitura of a classically trained contralto would still make these singers more comfortable singing in the lower part of the voice. A choral non-solo contralto may also have a low range down to D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (thus perhaps finding it easier to sing the choral tenor part), but some would have difficulty singing above E&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. In a choral context mezzo-sopranos and contraltos might sing the alto part, together with countertenors, thus having three vocal timbres (and two means of vocal production) singing the same notes.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2005), Choral Pedagogy&lt;/ref&gt;

Alto is rarely used to describe a solo voice (except in the case of soloists in choral works), though there is a multitude of terms in common usage in various languages and in different cultures for solo singers in this range. Examples include contralto, countertenor, ''[[haute-contre]]'', and ''tenor altino'' among others.

'''Audience immersion''' is the result an [[actor]] or [[performer]] uses with their own ability and technique, to draw the audience further into the story through direct interaction. It is especially used in [[theatre]]. It is also known as "going beyond the fourth wall".

'''''Aztaka''''' is a [[Personal computer|PC]] [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[action game|action]] [[role-playing video game]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[OS X]] developed by Canadian [[independent game developer]]&lt;ref name="gamemachine"/&gt; Citérémis. The game is set in the [[Aztec]] period, with characters and story being re-interpretations of [[Aztec mythology]] and [[pre-Hispanic]] [[Mexican culture]]. It puts the player in the role of an [[Aztec warfare|Aztec warrior]] named "Huitzilo" who must gather seven [[phonographs]] to save his civilization from its angry gods.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Aztaka Skill Window.jpg|thumb|left|Game screenshot]]

The gameplay is reminiscent of an [[old school gaming|old-school]] [[action role-playing game]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The player climbs, crawls and jumps his way around a level to explore it and find new items. Experience points are gained for every enemy killed, and they are spent to upgrade the character's attributes and special skills. There is also an inventory screen where discovered items can be equipped and where merchandise bought from merchants (like potions) can be used.

The game is controlled with the [[WASD keys]] and the mouse. The keyboard makes Huitzilo move and jump like in a [[platform game]]. The mouse is used to drag-and-drop on-screen energy particles. Doing this allows the player to modify parts of the game world, as well as unlock a variety of doorways or pick-up previously unattainable items. As the player progresses in the game, he gains containers that allows him to store on-screen energy particles for later use. The mouse is also used to cast spells, both offensive and defensive, by selecting them from the bottom-screen magic inventory and then clicking at on-screen targets in succession to launch them.

Artwork throughout the game reflects historical [[Mesoamerica]], with square-shaped pyramids, stone temples, mystic engravings, dense jungles, and barren mountaintops. The game's musical score features vocals, flute, cello, organ, and drums.

(January 10, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; This edition was priced $19.99 (normal version $9.99) and included the [[source code]] of the game, as well as the [[Art book]] and [[soundtrack]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://amanita-design.net/blog/2011/01/07/aztaka-developers-edition/ Aztaka Developer’s Edition] on [[Amanita Design|amanitadesign.com]] (January 7, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamershell.com/news_108978.html Aztaka Developer's Edition Released] on gamershell.com (January 10, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the game was part of a game [[Product bundling|bundle]] sale.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/06/19/twice-the-bundle-twice-the-uh-fundle/#more-112850 Twice The Bundle, Twice The, Uh, Fundle] by Alec Meer on [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] (June 19th, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

The '''Belarusian Telegraph Agency''' or '''BelTA''' ({{lang-be|Беларускае Тэлеграфнае Агенцтва}}, {{lang-ru|link=no|Белорусское Телеграфное Агентство}}, БелТА) is the state-owned national [[news agency]] of the [[Republic of Belarus]]. It operates in Russian, Belarusian, English, German and Spanish languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.belta.by/ BELTA website] (English language version)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The agency was founded on December 23, 1918. During the Soviet times BelTA cooperated with the [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union]] (TASS), although it was legally independent of it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} 

After the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|USSR seized to exist in 1991]], BelTA has been the national news agency of Belarus. It transmits over a hundred daily reports, and provides information to other news agencies of [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] members about the activities of Belarusian officials and organizations in and out of the country.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

BelTA has offices in all [[administrative divisions of Belarus|regions of Belarus]], as well as abroad. The main office is in [[Minsk]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==EU sanctions==

The BelTA Director-General [[Dzmitry Zhuk]] has been banned from Entering the [[European Union]] between 2011 and 2016 as part of the EU's [[International sanctions|sanctions]] against Belarus following what the EU describes as a crackdown of opposition protests after the [[Belarusian presidential election, 2010|2010 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://nn.by/?c=ar&amp;i=61552 Поўны спіс 208 беларускіх чыноўнікаў, якім забаронены ўезд у ЕС] – [Full list of 208 Belarusian officials banned from entering the EU], [[Nasha Niva]], October 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Council of the European Union|EU Council]]'s decision concerning restrictive measures against Belarus following the 2010 election, Dzmitry Zhuk is responsible for ''"relaying state propaganda in the media, which has supported and justified the repression of the democratic opposition and of civil society on December 19, 2010 using falsified information."''&lt;ref name="EU2012"&gt;.[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec/2012/642/oj Council Decision 2012/642/CFSP of 15 October 2012 concerning restrictive measures against Belarus], [[EUR-Lex]], 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ben 10: Ultimate Alien''''' is an American [[animated television series]]{{spaced ndash}}the third entry in [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Ben 10]] franchise created by team Man of Action (a group consisting of [[Duncan Rouleau]], [[Joe Casey]], [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]], and [[Steven T. Seagle]]), and produced by [[Cartoon Network Studios]].

It was slated to premiere after the series finale of ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force]]'' on March 26, 2010, but actually premiered on April 23, 2010, in the US and in the UK.{{Clarify|Was the UK premiere in March or October?|date=April 2012}}

In [[India]] and [[Latin America]], it premiered on October 10, 2010.

In Canada, the series started airing on September 12, 2010, on [[Teletoon]].

The series finale aired on March 31, 2012 with the two-part episode, ''The Ultimate Enemy'', being in memory of series developer and producer [[Dwayne McDuffie]], who died during the production of the series.

==Plot==
The plot follows on from ''Ben 10: Alien Force''; set one year after the events of the [[Ben 10: Alien Force|previous series]]. The Omnitrix has been destroyed, and Ben must learn to master the incredible and incomprehensible secrets of the new Ultimatrix, a gauntlet-like version of the old Omnitrix that not only gives him access to ''all'' of his original alien abilities, but also allows him to evolve his alien forms into far much stronger and more powerful versions; called "ultimate forms."

However, in the premiere episode, "Fame", a young fan named Jimmy Jones deduces Ben's secret identity and reveals it to the world. Ben becomes an overnight celebrity, hailed by kids as a hero but distrusted by most adults as a possible threat. With Gwen, Kevin, Julie, and Grandpa Max still at his side, Ben continues to battle alien threats to the galaxy, including finding five aliens that were attacked and kidnapped by an Osmosian villain named Aggregor. Their names were Bivalvan, Galapegus, P'andor, Andreas, and Ra'ad. After Aggregor captured and fused with all five aliens, he began searching for the Map of Infinity to go to the Forge of Creation and absorb the vast God/cosmic-like powers of Celestialsapiens.

Later, Kevin is forced to absorb energy from the Ultimatrix and goes insane with tremendous energy and power, but is shown that he does still have a good human heart, and still does care, and that he has not gone completely evil. Kevin is eventually returned to normal and Aggregor's actions are reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/search/index.html?keywords=ben%2010%20ultimate%20alien/ |title=CN Official Site Update |publisher=Cartoonnetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second season features more self-contained stories rather than employing an overall storyline, although a real storyline is developing with the appearance of the mysterious, but dangerous Sir George and the extra-dimensional demon called "Diagon".

After the defeat of Vilgax who absorbed the enormous abilities and powers of Diagon to become even stronger and more powerful, Azmuth appears to ask Ben to give his sword, Ascalon, and the Ultimatrix back, giving Ben the new-and-improved and greatly modified version of the Omnitrix.

{{distinguish|Chorography}}
[[File:Zorn Cachucha.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Choreography for the Spanish dance [[Cachucha]], described using [[dance notation]]]]

'''Choreography''' is the [[art]] or practice of designing [[sequence]]s of movements of physical bodies (or their depictions) in which [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [[Visual appearance|form]], or both are specified. ''Choreography'' may also refer to the [[design]] itself. A '''choreographer''' is one who creates choreographies by practicing the art of choreography, a process known as ''choreographing''. Choreography is used in a variety of fields, including musical theater, [[cheerleading]], [[cinematography]], [[gymnastics]], [[fashion shows]], [[ice skating]], [[marching band]], [[show choir]], [[theatre]], [[synchronized swimming]], [[cardistry]], video game production and animated art. In the [[performing arts]], choreography applies to human movement and form. In [[dance]], choreography is also known as [[choreography (dance)|dance choreography]] or ''dance composition''.

==Etymology==
The word ''choreography'' literally means "dance-writing" from the Greek words "χορεία" (circular dance, see [[choreia (dance)|choreia]]) and "γραφή" (writing). It first appeared in the American English dictionary in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Chroma Squad''''' is a [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing]] video game developed by Brazilian development team [[Behold Studios]]. The game is influenced by [[tokusatsu]] TV shows, particularly the ''[[Super Sentai]]'' and ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchises. The game's development was funded via [[Kickstarter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chroma Squad - manager game with japanese-style super heroes by Saulo Camarotti|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1893273284/chroma-squad-manager-game-with-japanese-style-supe/|accessdate=4 May 2015|work=Kickstarter|date=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was released on April 30, 2015 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Linux]]. Digital distribution is available through [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and [[GOG.com]]. ''Chroma Squad'' was released in early 2017 for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]  mobile devices, being published by [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/9/2/12771884/chroma-squad-ps4-xbox-one-vita|title=Super sentai RPG Chroma Squad is coming to consoles|last=Frank|first=Allegra|date=2016-09-02|website=Polygon|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[PlayStation Vita]] version was planned, however was ultimately cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/chroma-squad-coming-to-playstation-4-and-xbox-one-in-may-419851.phtml|title=Chroma Squad coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in May|website=Destructoid|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced to be released on May 19, 2017 on PSN for PlayStation 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.us.playstation.com/2017/05/12/the-drop-new-playstation-games-for-5162017/|title=The Drop: New PlayStation Games for 5/16/2017|website=PlayStation.Blog|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The game follows a team of stunt actors that tired of their previous job, decide to start their own [[Tokusatsu]] company, assisted by a mysterious artifact they find known as "Cerebro".

==Gameplay==
Once the studio is established, the player must assign the actors, each with their own special traits, to their respective roles in the team and their suits' colors. Other features can be changed as the game progresses including the team's name, the name of their robot and their catchphrases. Each stage in the game is a different episode of the show in which the heroes fight a group of villains, sometimes followed by a battle between the team's giant mecha and an enlarged monster, and their performance during the episode take a direct impact on the show's ratings. High ratings increase the show's fanbase and revenue, which can be used to improve the studio and upgrade the team's equipment and mecha. The episodes are grouped into seasons and failure to complete the goals set by the sponsors at the end of each season will lead to a game over.

The battles follow the heroes fighting initially in their normal selves, but later gaining the ability to transform, recovering their HP and obtaining special abilities. The "teamwork" function allows heroes to help each other during battle, be it reaching longer distances, dealing powerful attacks together, or combining their powers into a special attack that increases ratings when used to destroy the [[Villain of the week|monster of the week]].

Duke and Cera play fictionalized versions of themselves, Cera describing the characters as "more idiotic and more deluded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chattman |first=Jon |url=http://thecheappop.com/2007/05/04/arrested-developments-michael-cera/ |title=welcome to thecheappop.com...your daily dose of pop culture and mustache envy » Blog Archive » Arrested Development’s Michael Cera |publisher=Thecheappop.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series is a low-budget affair, filmed on handheld cameras by friends of the duo.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.03/snackfilmtv.html |title=Wired 15.03: Snack Attack! |publisher=Wired.com |date=2009-01-04 |accessdate=2012-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730230854/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.03/snackfilmtv.html |archivedate=2012-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cameras are acknowledged by Clark, Michael and others, who will sometimes address them or those operating them; in one scene, an upset Michael shouts a cameraman out of the bathroom, after which Clark angrily points out to the crew that their contract states "no bathroom stuff". Boom mics are often visible, and the crew have also intervened in fights between Clark and Michael.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarkandmichael.com/index.php?id=3004 |title=Clark And Michael |publisher=Clark And Michael |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Clark and Michael's ambition of producing their own television series is stated in the opening of the first episode, and forms the drive of the series. After being turned down initially, the pair come to terms with the fact that success will not be instantaneous, and continue to pursue new opportunities. Though their agent succeeds in scheduling a meeting to discuss their show with another network, Clark's drunken behavior changes their mind about picking up the show. Following this, the pair has a meeting with agent Ramsay, who recommends that Michael be made the "hero" of the series. Bothered by this, Clark reveals an idea for his own series, ''D.A. Dad'', to the crew, and begins pursuing the concept.

Some time later, the pair are watching television together when they see an ad for ''D.A. Dad''. Clark reacts angrily, explaining that the show was his and the concept had been taken and produced by someone else. Michael is hurt that Clark would work separately from him, but the pair eventually reconcile their differences and their arrangement returns to normal. Michael takes up driving lessons, and takes an interest in one of his fellow students. The pair try to get [[Kenny Loggins]] to perform the theme song for their show, but can't get in touch with him. Michael only barely passes his driving test, and Clark informs him that he won't be driving his car. Regretting this overreaction, he makes it up to Michael with a game of [[minigolf]]. A meeting with another potential network ends poorly, unbeknownst to the two, when their arrogant behavior in general makes a bad impression on the executives. Clark soon makes it into Columbia University, and plans to move to [[New York City]] to attend. Yet Clark ultimately decides against university when they achieve their TV show dream, with CBS signing them up (as well as in real life).

==Guest stars==
Several [[guest star]]s have made appearances in the series:
* Some of Michael Cera's former co-workers from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]''
** [[Tony Hale]] was featured in the first episode as an executive for the fictional ATC Family network, who turned down the pair's concept.
** [[Mitch Hurwitz]] (''Arrested Development'' creator) appeared as agent Ramsay, while Clark Duke's attorney, Jerry Lillard, was played by [[Andy Richter]].
** When Michael attended driving lessons, he was taught by [[David Cross]].
*[[Eric Wareheim]] and [[Tim Heidecker]] (''[[Tom Goes to the Mayor]]'', ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'') both have made appearances, with Heidecker as a martial arts instructor, and Wareheim's recurring role as their neighbor, Randy.
* Comedian [[Patton Oswalt]] (''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'') appears as a realtor who sells them an office building.
* [[Jonah Hill]] (Cera's ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'' co-star) and [[John Francis Daley]] (''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'') appear as a rival television writing team.

In April 2013, [[Emma Sulkowicz]], an American fourth-year [[visual arts]] major at [[Columbia University]] in New York City, filed a complaint with Columbia University requesting expulsion of fellow fourth-year student and German national, Paul Nungesser, alleging he had raped them in Sulkowicz's [[dorm room]] on August 27, 2012.&lt;ref name="aol._Colu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia student says he didn't rape Emma Sulkowicz|last=Chapman|first=Isabelle|work=AOL.com|date=February 3, 2015|accessdate=May 29, 2016|url=http://www.aol.com/article/2015/02/03/columbia-student-says-he-didnt-rape-emma-sulkowicz/21138562/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nungesser was found 'not responsible' by a university inquiry. In 2017, the university issued a statement acknowledging that Nungesser experienced a "very difficult" time, promised to keep its gender-based misconduct policies fair, and settled Nungesser's lawsuit under undisclosed terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grace |first=Veronica |url=http://columbiaspectator.com/main/2017/07/13/columbia-settles-nungesser-title-ix-lawsuit/ |title=Columbia settles Nungesser's Title IX lawsuit - Columbia Daily Spectator |website=Columbiaspectator.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, Sulkowicz filed a report against Nungesser with the [[New York Police Department]] (NYPD), who did not pursue charges.&lt;ref name="waponun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt; The [[New York County District Attorney|district attorney's office]] interviewed both students, but did not pursue charges, citing lack of [[reasonable suspicion]].&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt; Sulkowicz declined to pursue criminal charges any further,&lt;ref name=VanSyckle20January2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name="VanSyckle4September2014"/&gt; and stated that NYPD officers were dismissive and had mistreated Sulkowicz.&lt;ref name="goth_Spur"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spurned By Columbia, Student Says NYPD Mistreated Her While Reporting Rape|author=Christopher Robbins|work=Gothamist|date=May 18, 2014|accessdate=May 29, 2016|url=http://gothamist.com/2014/05/18/spurned_by_columbia_student_says_ny.php|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524012014/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/18/spurned_by_columbia_student_says_ny.php|archivedate=May 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VanSyckle4September2014"/&gt;

After Columbia declined to take action against Nungesser, Sulkowicz focused their senior thesis on a work of [[performance art]] entitled ''[[Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)]]'' which involved Sulkowicz carrying a 50-pound dorm mattress on campus to represent the painful burden rape victims carry throughout daily life, and in protest of what they described as Columbia University's mishandling of their sexual assault complaint.&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/10/29/its-hard-to-ignore-a-woman-toting-a-mattress-everywhere-she-goes-which-is-why-emma-sulkowicz-is-still-doing-it|title=It's hard to ignore a woman toting a mattress everywhere she goes, which is why Emma Sulkowicz is still doing it|work=The Washington Post|date=October 29, 2014|author=McDonald, Soraya Nadia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nungesser called Sulkowicz's allegations "untrue and unfounded" and described the mattress piece as an act of bullying intended to force him to leave Columbia.&lt;ref name=VanSyckle20January2015&gt;Van Syckle, Katie (20 January 2015).

In April 2015, Nungesser filed a Title IX gender discrimination lawsuit against Columbia, its board of trustees, its president [[Lee Bollinger]], and Sulkowicz's supervising art professor [[Jon Kessler]], alleging their negligence in preventing his alleged harassment.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kutner|first1=Max|title=The Anti-Mattress Protest: Paul Nungesser’s Lawsuit Against Columbia University|url=http://www.newsweek.com/anti-mattress-protest-paul-nungessers-lawsuit-against-columbia-university-326319|accessdate=May 29, 2016|publisher=Newsweek|date=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/columbia-student-alleges-gender-bias-rape-claim-tossed-30542783|title=Correction: Columbia University-Gender Bias Suit Story|first=Larry|last=Neumeister|date=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nungesser was represented by Title IX campus due process attorney Andrew Miltenberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/07/13/columbia-university-settles-title-ix-lawsuit-with-former-student-involving-mattress-girl-case/|title=Columbia University settles Title IX lawsuit with former student involving ‘mattress girl’ case|last=Shapiro|first=T.

In the documents of the complaint, Nungesser stated Sulkowicz's allegation of rape was false, citing as evidence behavior Nungesser said was counterintuitive, such as friendly texts Sulkowicz sent Nungesser days after the alleged attack occurred.&lt;ref name="DailyBeast"/&gt; The complaint argued Sulkowicz's allegation was made in response to unreciprocated desire for a serious relationship, therefore allowing the performance was harassment and a violation of his student rights.  When questioned about the lawsuit, Sulkowicz said that it was "full of lies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/paul-nungesser-lawsuit-columbia-sulkowicz-452241|title=Paul Nungesser’s lawsuit against Columbia over Emma Sulkowicz’s "mattress protest" returns to court|date=2016-04-25|work=Newsweek|access-date=2017-08-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal District Court Judge [[Gregory H.

==Paul Nungesser==
Paul Jonathan Nungesser (German: Nunge[[ß]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;er;&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Cadenbach: [http://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/texte/anzeigen/42729/Nachtschatten Nachtschatten], Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin, Heft 5/2015.{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ulrike Demmer, Susann Remke: [http://www.focus.de/panorama/welt/politik-und-gesellschaft-ich-habe-emma-nicht-vergewaltigt_id_4456606.html "Ich habe Emma nicht vergewaltigt"], Focus Magazin Nr. 7/2015.{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; born 1991 in Berlin) is a German citizen who studied [[architecture]] at Columbia.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyBeast/&gt;

==Allegations==
===Allegations by Sulkowicz===
On April 18, 2013, Sulkowicz reported to Columbia's Office of Gender-Based and Sexual Misconduct that, on the first day of their [[sophomore year]] on August 27, 2012, in Sulkowicz's dorm room, they were raped by fellow student Nungesser.&lt;ref name=NYT3May2014/&gt;&lt;ref name="EmmaParentsLetter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2014/10/02/open-letter-president-bollinger-and-board-trustees|title=An open letter to President Bollinger and the board of trustees|publisher=Columbia Spectator|date=October 2, 2014|accessdate=April 25, 2015|author1=Leong, Sandra|author2=Sulkowicz, Kerry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing the alleged rape, Sulkowicz said that what began as a [[consensual sex|consensual sexual encounter]] in Sulkowicz's room turned non-consensual. Sulkowicz alleged that Nungesser [[choking|choked]] them, slapped their face, held their wrists, and [[anal rape|anally raped]] them, while Sulkowicz struggled and told him to stop.&lt;ref name=NYT3May2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bogler16May2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bogler|first1=Emma|title=Frustrated by Columbia’s inaction, student reports sexual assault to police|url=http://columbiaspectator.com/news/2014/05/16/frustrated-columbias-inaction-student-reports-sexual-assault-police|work=Columbia Spectator|date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sulkowicz said that after the alleged assault, Nungesser immediately left the room without speaking.&lt;ref name="DailyBeast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/03/columbia-student-i-didn-t-rape-her.html|title=Columbia Student: I Didn't Rape Her|publisher=The Daily Beast|date=February 3, 2015|accessdate=May 29, 2016|author=Young, Cathy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He and Sulkowicz both corroborate that they had consensual sex twice before, earlier in the year, but not anal sex. Nungesser said that the encounter in August was also entirely consensual, and he denied the allegations of violence, stating that they briefly had consensual anal sex, followed by other sexual activity, after which they fell asleep, saying he left the room early in the morning while Sulkowicz was still sleeping.&lt;ref name="DailyBeast"/&gt;

Afterwards they communicated via Facebook messages. Nungesser later described these messages as "amiable" and showed transcripts of these messages to [[Cathy Young]], a contributor for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' who has been critical of campus sexual assault activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kay|first=Barbara|title=Rape culture’s biggest victim may be honesty and truth|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/barbara-kay-rape-cultures-biggest-victim-may-be-honesty-and-truth|publisher=''National Post''|date=May 22, 2015|quote=During the summer there was warm, affectionate Facebook chatter between them (screenshots provided to The Daily Beast).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bazelon|first=Emily|title=Have We Learned Anything From the Columbia Rape Case?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/29/magazine/have-we-learned-anything-from-the-columbia-rape-case.html|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=May 29, 2015|quote=After The Daily Beast published the exchanges, Sulkowicz explained them to the website Jezebel, recalling, “I'm being irrational, thinking that talking with him would help me.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sulkowicz expressed concern that the messages would be used to present them as unreliable, and stated they had sent them because they were upset and wanted to talk to him about the incident but decided against doing so.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2015-02-04"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaplan|first1=Sarah|title=In Columbia University rape case, accuser and accused are now fighting it out in public|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/02/04/in-columbia-university-rape-case-accuser-and-accused-are-now-fighting-it-out-in-public|accessdate=February 17, 2015|publisher=The Washington Post|date=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Sulkowicz's last message, which they sent in March 2013, they said they had visited the university's Office of Gender-Based Misconduct and that they had asked whether they had tried talking to the accused. A university spokesperson said in February 2015 that its gender-based misconduct policy does not recommend informal resolution or mediation for such complaints.&lt;ref name="DailyBeast"/&gt;

In response to criticisms regarding the delay in reporting, Sulkowicz said they initially didn't report the incident to avoid emotional trauma.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

===Allegations from others===
Three other complaints have been alleged against Nungesser: a second woman accused him of emotional abuse and nonconsensual sex during a months-long relationship, a third student accused him of non-consensually kissing her and touching her at a party, and a fourth accuser emerged in early 2015, a fourth-year male student who said Nungesser sexually assaulted him after an emotional conversation. The second accuser's investigation was discontinued after she said she was "exhausted by the barrage of questions" and stopped responding to emails from the University's Title IX coordinator for sexual assault investigations.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

In early 2013 Sulkowicz discussed the incident with "Natalie", Nungesser's former girlfriend. Natalie alleged that there had been non-consensual sex and emotional abuse during her relationship with Nungesser, which lasted from October 2011 to spring 2012. Nungesser denies that charge and describes their time together as a couple as a "difficult relationship".&lt;ref name="DailyBeast"/&gt; Sulkowicz said that the conversation with Natalie prompted them to file a formal complaint to the university. Sulkowicz filed a complaint on April 18, 2013 and Natalie filed one a few days later.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyBeast"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leong/&gt;

The third complaint from a student identified as "Josie" was initially decided against Nungesser, with an assigned punishment of disciplinary probation, but Nungesser successfully appealed, citing procedural errors and problems with the admission of [[hearsay]]. Nungesser further appealed on grounds that his accuser had failed to demonstrate guilt by a "preponderance of the evidence" as required in campus hearings.&lt;ref name="DailyBeast"/&gt; He says the allegations, which were all brought within days of each other, were the result of [[collusion]] and are fraudulent. The three women said in interviews with ''[[The New York Times]]'' that they decided to file formal complaints with the school after they heard about one another's experiences.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

The fourth student, identified as "Adam", said he first reported the incident to the group to which they both belonged, and then he filed a Title IX complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/02/alleged-columbia-rapist-accused-of-new-assault.html|title=Male Columbia Student Says Alleged Rapist in ‘Mattress Girl’ Case Assaulted Him Too|last=Roy|first=Jessica|date=February 6, 2015|publisher=''New York'' magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Columbia also investigated the complaint and found Nungesser "not responsible". According to Cathy Young, the investigators found contradictions in Adam's statements and Facebook dialogs between the men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://reason.com/archives/2015/05/20/columbia-rape-saga-lingers-after-mattres/ | title=As Another Accusation Bites the Dust, Columbia Rape Saga Takes New Turn | date=20 May 2015 | accessdate=6 June 2016 | author=Young, Cathy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Armus|first1=Teto|title=Paul Nungesser found "not responsible" for alleged sexual assault of male student|url=http://columbiaspectator.com/spectrum/2015/05/21/paul-nungesser-found-not-responsible-alleged-sexual-assault-male-student|accessdate=6 June 2016|publisher=Columbia Spectator|date=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome of Sulkowicz's hearing, Nungesser's first complaints==
On October 29, the day after Nungesser's third accuser's hearing, one was scheduled for Sulkowicz's case. In November the university found Paul Nungesser "not responsible".&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/22/nyregion/accusers-and-the-accused-crossing-paths-at-columbia.html|title=Accusers and the Accused, Crossing Paths at Columbia University|work=The New York Times|date=December 22, 2014|author=Kaminer, Ariel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leong&gt;{{cite web|url=http://columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2014/10/02/open-letter-president-bollinger-and-board-trustees|title=An open letter to President Bollinger and the board of trustees|work=Columbia Spectator|date=October 2, 2014|author1=Leong, Sandra|author2=Sulkowicz, Kerry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sulkowicz's request for an appeal was turned down by the dean.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/99780/campus-sexual-assault-emma-sulkowicz|title='My Rapist Is Still on Campus'|work=Time|date=May 15, 2014|author=Sulkowicz, Emma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulkowicz and Nungesser both complained separately about the proceedings. Sulkowicz complained that Nungesser was granted months of postponements during the hearing, and that they were not allowed to discuss the case with anyone. Sulkowicz said that a university investigator asked inappropriate questions during the interview, and complained that the panel did not consider other allegations against the accused student.&lt;ref name=NYT3May2014/&gt; A graduate student who acted as Nungesser's official supporter during the hearing defended the panel, disputing that their questions were inappropriate, saying the questions "were extremely personal because they had to be".&lt;ref name="DailyBeast"/&gt;

Nungesser complained that he had not been allowed to introduce Facebook messages as evidence. Nungesser and Sulkowicz exchanged several messages in the days and weeks after the alleged rape. In one message, two days after the alleged rape, Sulkowicz accepted an invitation to a party from Nungesser, writing: "I feel like we need to have some real time where we can talk about life and thingz, because we still haven't really had a paul-emma chill sesh since summmmerrrr."&lt;ref name=NYT3May2014/&gt; Sulkowicz says they sent the messages because they were upset and wanted to talk to Nungesser about the incident.&lt;ref name="jeze_Howt"&gt;{{cite web| title = How to Make an Accused Rapist Look Good| last = Ryan | first = Erin Gloria| work = Jezebel| date = 2015-02-06| accessdate = 2016-10-19| url = http://jezebel.com/how-to-make-an-accused-rapist-look-good-1682583526}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mic.com"&gt;Zeilinger, Julie (February 3, 2015).

Reporter Katie Zavadski, writing for ''[[New York Magazine]]'', opined that amicable exchanges with an alleged attacker didn't disprove that a sexual assault occurred, and Cathy Young acknowledged that victims of sexual violence may cope with trauma in ways that could seem puzzling to outsiders.&lt;ref name="DailyBeast"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nymag"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zavadski|first1=Katie|title=Alleged Rapist in Columbia Case Offers His Version of Events, Produces Message Transcripts|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/02/alleged-rapist-in-columbia-case-speaks-out-again.html|website=NYMag|accessdate=May 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 24, Sulkowicz and 22 other students (later joined by five others) filed a 100-page federal complaint alleging that Columbia University and [[Barnard College]] mishandled their sexual-assault complaints, in violation of [[Title IX]], a federal civil rights law to ensure gender equality on campuses.&lt;ref name=Grigoriadis21September2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bogler24April2014/&gt; The complaint alleged that the universities were in violation of Title II, a provision against discrimination by a public body on the basis of disability,&lt;ref&gt;Pryal, Katie Rose Guest (January 15, 2015).

On May 3, 2014 an interview with Sulkowicz appeared on the front page of ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name=NYT3May2014/&gt; For several days from May 7 onwards, Paul Nungesser's name was included within lists of "sexual assault violators" written on the walls or doors of campus bathrooms, or on flyers.&lt;ref&gt;Abby Abrams (May 13, 2014).

==Sulkowicz's performance art piece==
{{main|Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)}}
[[File:Emma Sulkowicz, Mattress Performance, 19 May 2015 (cropped).JPG|thumb|Sulkowicz (center right) carrying the mattress at graduation]]
Sulkowicz created ''[[Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)]]'' in the summer of 2014 for their [[senior thesis]] while at [[Yale University]] Summer School of Art and Music. Their first effort was a [[Video art|video]] of themself dismantling a bed, accompanied by the audio of them filing the police report, which they had recorded on their cellphone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMXp3RLOVNg Smith 2014], c. 38:45 mins.&lt;/ref&gt; The mattress later became the sole focus of the piece.&lt;ref name="RobertaSmithNYT"&gt;{{cite web| title = In a Mattress, a Lever for Art and Political Protest| last = Smith | first = Roberta| work = The New York Times| date = 21 September 2014| accessdate = 2016-05-04| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/arts/design/in-a-mattress-a-fulcrum-of-art-and-political-protest.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sulkowicz told [[New York Magazine|''New York'' magazine]]:

{{quote|I thought about how&amp;nbsp;... the mattress represents a private place where a lot of your intimate life happens; and how I have brought my life out in front for the public to see; and the act of bringing something private and intimate out into the public mirrors the way my life has been. Also the mattress as a burden, because of what has happened there, that has turned my own relationship with my bed into something fraught.&lt;ref name="VanSyckle4September2014"&gt;Van Syckle, Katie (4 September 2014). [http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/09/columbia-emma-sulkowicz-mattress-rape-performance-interview.html "The Columbia Student Carrying a Mattress Everywhere Says Reporters Are Triggering Rape Memories"], ''New York Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The {{convert|50|lb|abbr=out|adj=on}}, dark-blue, extra-long [[Twin bed|twin]] mattress used in the performance art piece is of the kind Columbia places in its dorms, similar to the one on which they allege they were raped. Sulkowicz spent the summer of 2014 creating the rules of engagement: Written on the walls of their studio in the university's Watson Hall, these state that they must carry the mattress whenever they are on university property; that it must remain on campus even when Sulkowicz is not there; and that they are not allowed to ask for help in carrying it, but if help is offered they may accept it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMXp3RLOVNg Smith, December 17, 2014], from c. 39:57 mins; for Watson Hall, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9hHZbuYVnU Sulkowicz, September 2, 2014], from c. 2:00 mins.&lt;/ref&gt; In September that year they began carrying it on campus, which they say is a physically painful experience.&lt;ref&gt;Duan, Noel (September 9, 2014). [http://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a14546/columbia-university-sexual-assault-mattress-performance-emma-sulkowicz "Going From Class to Class With Emma Sulkowicz and Her Mattress"], Elle.com; accessed May 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Sulkowicz later created another piece of performance art, [[Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol]] ("This is not a rape"), a website with an eight minute video of Sulkowicz having sex with an anonymous actor in a dorm room at Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;Lux Alptraum, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/21/style/campus-sex-women-exposure.html There Is Life After Campus Infamy]", in ''The New York Times'', July 21, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Alptraum confirms not only the existence of the piece but its relation to the rape--&gt;

==Nungesser's lawsuit==
On April 23, 2015, Nungesser filed a sexual discrimination lawsuit against Columbia, its board of trustees, its president Lee Bollinger, and Sulkowicz's supervising art professor Jon Kessler. The suit alleged that the performance was bullying and constituted gender-based harassment, and argued that Columbia's offering course credit for the work violated his rights under Title IX. The suit sought damages for the harm Nungesser said he experienced to his reputation as a result of the performance.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name = huffsuit&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/23/sexual-assault-lawsuit-columbia_n_7132602.html Student Accused Being 'Serial Rapist' Files Lawsuit Against Columbia And Art Professor, Associated Press/Huffington Post]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt;

The suit argues that Nungesser had provided evidence that the encounter was consensual with lack of signs of physical or emotional trauma and text based messages where Sulkowicz responded to Nungesser positively after the encounter. The suit also faults Columbia University for awarding course credits for a project that accused him of rape.&lt;ref name = msnbc&gt;Irin Carmon (April 24, 2015), [http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/columbia-student-accused-rape-sues-university Columbia student accused of rape sues university], msnbc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = msnbc /&gt; The suit alleged gender based discrimination, arguing that Nungesser was "targeted because he is a male, and attacked for his (consensual) sexual activity."&lt;ref name = msnbc /&gt; Nungesser's suit also alleged that the publicity surrounding the case had harmed his job prospects.&lt;ref name="news_Mans"&gt;{{cite web| title = Man sues uni for mattress rape protest| author = AP and Network Writers| work = NewsComAu| date = 24 April 2015| accessdate = 2016-05-04| url = http://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/paul-nungesser-is-suing-columbia-university-in-new-york-for-allowing-emma-sulkowicz-to-carry-a-mattress-around-suggesting-he-raped-her/news-story/266fb8250341e0bb82560910fb6d7a1c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was assigned to [[US District Court]] Judge [[Gregory Howard Woods|Gregory Woods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/this-weeks-news/id=1202724570874/Student-Accused-of-Rape-by-Former-Friend-Sues-Columbia?mcode=1202615038803&amp;curindex=30 | title=Student Accused of Rape by Former Friend Sues Columbia | publisher=''[[New York Law Journal]]'' | date=April 27, 2015 | accessdate=April 30, 2015 | author=Neumeister, Larry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woods dismissed the case in March 2016, but allowed Nungesser another attempt.&lt;ref name="huff_Laws1"/&gt; Nungesser issued an amended complaint in April 2016. The amended complaint argued that Columbia University's sexual assault policies promoted a stereotype of the "sex-driven male", and constituted gender based discrimination in violation of [[Title IX]]. On March 24, 2017 Woods dismissed Nungesser's re-filed complaint, ruling that Nungesser had failed to state an actionable claim against Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kutner|first1=Max|title=Court throws out Paul Nungesser's ‘anti-male’ lawsuit against Columbia, for good.|url=http://www.newsweek.com/paul-nungesser-columbia-lawsuit-dismissed-sulkowicz-mattress-574110|accessdate=8 May 2017|agency=Newsweek|date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After having the lawsuit dismissed twice, Nungesser had prepared an appeal, but he eventually agreed to settle with the university in July 2017.&lt;ref name="waponun"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/07/13/columbia-university-settles-title-ix-lawsuit-with-former-student-involving-mattress-girl-case/|title=Columbia University settles Title IX lawsuit with former student involving ‘mattress girl’ case|last=Shapiro|first=T.

===Commentary on lawsuit===
Robby Soave, an editor for ''[[Reason.com]]'', commented that Nungesser was "flipping the script" by basing his suit on Title IX, because "many alleged victims of rape who believe that they were deprived of justice have turned to Title IX when they assert that their universities are failing to honor federal requirements."&lt;ref name="Reason.com"&gt;Soave, Robby (April 30, 2015), [http://reason.com/blog/2015/04/30/mattress-girl-lawsuit-can-paul-nungesser Mattress Girl Lawsuit: Can Paul Nungesser Beat Columbia in Court? Experts Weigh In - "His time at college and future have been shattered"], Reason.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators expressed skepticism that Nungesser's claim would succeed in court. [[Megan McArdle]] commented on the Title IX complaint in ''[[Bloomberg View]]'' saying, "I don't find (Nungesser's) litany of complaints particularly compelling", and stated that they believed the gender discrimination claim was unlikely to succeed. McArdle concluded by suggesting that Nungesser may not have intended to win the suit or to silence Sulkowicz, but instead to "force the media to pay a little attention to his side of the story, something that didn't happen during the many long months of Sulkowicz's campaign to name and shame him."&lt;ref&gt;Megan McArdle: [http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-04-27/accused-gets-his-say-in-columbia-rape-case Accused Gets His Say in Columbia Rape Case], Bloomberg View, April 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Slate columnist Nora Caplan-Bricker questioned whether the suit could succeed, noting that courts have previously dismissed similar suits in which men accused of sexual assault claimed that they were victims of gender discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caplan-Bricker|first1=Nora|title=Paul Nungesser Tries Again To Sue Columbia ...

Cathy Young, commenting on the dismissal of Nungesser's suit in the ''New York Post'', conceded that "Nungesser's case is more of an uphill battle than most", but nevertheless argued that she hoped "the lawsuit goes forward — not only on Nungesser’s behalf, but for the sake of truth-seeking about a tangled case that raises important issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Cathy|title=Exposing rank injustice in the Columbia ‘mattress girl’ case|url=https://nypost.com/2016/03/18/exposing-rank-injustice-in-the-mattress-girl-case/|accessdate=8 May 2017|publisher=New York Post|date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amanda Marcotte]], in a column for the news site [[Talking Points Memo]], criticized Nungesser's decision to pursue a claim under Title IX rather than file a libel suit, and characterized the suit as a "nuisance lawsuit"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marcotte|first1=Amanda|title=Targeting Columbia's anti-rape activists|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/cafe/lawsuit-rape-columbia-emma-sulkowicz|website=Talking Points Memo|accessdate=May 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This characterization was disputed by Samantha Harris of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, who instead argued that the suit demonstrated the problem with requiring universities to investigate accusations of sexual assault, cautioning that "until something changes, we are likely to see more cases like this one."&lt;ref name="thefire"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Samantha|title=This is what a broken system looks like|url=https://www.thefire.org/this-is-what-a-broken-system-looks-like|website=thefire.org|accessdate=May 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses from Sulkowicz and Columbia University===
Sulkowicz responded to the lawsuit by saying it is "ridiculous that Paul would sue not only the school but one of my past professors for allowing me to make an art piece" and saying that Nungesser has made "continued public attempts to smear my reputation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Columbia Student Sues University, Says Rape Accuser Has Ruined His Reputation|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/04/23/columbia-university-lawsuit-mattress-rape-allegation|accessdate=April 24, 2015|publisher=CBS New York|date=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/male-student-sues-columbia-university-for-genderbased-harassment-after-alleged-mattress-performance-rape-victim-emma-sulkowicz-went-public-with-claims-10201388.html|title=Male student sues Columbia University for 'gender-based harassment' after alleged 'Mattress Performance' rape victim Emma Sulkowicz went public with claims|first=Heather|last=Saul|date=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school, via one of its spokespeople, had no official comment on the lawsuit, and Kessler also declined to comment,&lt;ref&gt;Emanuella Grinberg, [http://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/27/living/feat-columbia-mattress-project-lawsuit/ Columbia student accused of rape sues over accuser's performance art]. CNN, April 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; although Columbia University president Bollinger offered a general statement: "The law and principles of academic freedom allow students to express themselves on issues of public debate; at the same time, our legal and ethical responsibility is to be fair and impartial in protecting the rights and accommodating the concerns of all students in these matters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Columbia student cleared of rape sues school|url=http://www.aol.com/article/2015/04/25/columbia-student-cleared-of-rape-sues-school/21176390|accessdate=May 29, 2016|publisher=AOL News|date=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 14, 2017, Columbia and Nungesser agreed to settle the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=T. Rees Shapiro |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/07/13/columbia-university-settles-title-ix-lawsuit-with-former-student-involving-mattress-girl-case/ |title=Columbia University settles Title IX lawsuit with former student involving ‘mattress girl’ case |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date= |accessdate=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university said in a statement: “Columbia recognizes that after the conclusion of the investigation, Paul’s remaining time at Columbia became very difficult for him and not what Columbia would want any of its students to experience. Columbia will continue to review and update its policies toward ensuring that every student — accuser and accused, including those like Paul who are found not responsible — is treated respectfully and as a full member of the Columbia community.”&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

==Reception==
Public opinion regarding the case and lawsuit has been mixed.

Cathy Young, who has written other "stories critical of campus anti-rape activism,"&lt;ref name="Kaplan2015-02-04"/&gt; criticized Columbia University for violating the defendant's rights to due process, commenting there was "certainly enough evidence to grant Nungesser the benefit of reasonable doubt not only in legal disciplinary proceedings, but in the court of public opinion".&lt;ref name="mind_Did‘"&gt;{{cite web|title=Did ‘Mattress Girl’ Tell the Truth?

Erin Gloria Ryan of [[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] supported Sulkowicz, criticizing Young and accusing her of invoking a "perfect victim" narrative that relied on inaccurate stereotypes about how sexual assault victims should behave.&lt;ref name="jeze_Howt"/&gt; Senator [[Kirsten Gillibrand]] invited Sulkowicz to a [[State of the Union]] address in an effort to "further amplify" their voice, saying that activists like them "shine a light on the scourge of sexual assault" on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/01/sulkowicz-was-let-down-by-state-of-the-union.html |title=Emma Sulkowicz Was ‘Let Down’ by Obama SOTU Speech |last=Katie |first=Van Syckle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-kirsten-gillibrand/carrying-their-weight-giv_b_6516630.html |title=Carrying Their Weight: Giving Voice to Survivors of Campus Sexual Assault}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the lawsuit was settled, Dana Bolger, co-founder of [[Know Your IX]], expressed concern, saying she hoped universities wouldn't take the result "as a sign that they should be cracking down on student activism".&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

'''''Djantoeng Hati''''' ('''''Heart and Soul''''') is a 1941 film from the [[Dutch East Indies]] directed by [[Njoo Cheong Seng]]. A tragedy warning against modernity,{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=240}} it starred A Sarosa, Rr Anggraini, and Ariati

==Plot==
Two students&amp;nbsp;– the traditional Karina (Rr Anggraini) and metropolitan Roesdjana (Ariati)&amp;nbsp;– are in competition for Karina's husband Sobari (Chatir Harro). Eventually Karina wins out.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=240}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djantoeng Hati}}

==Production==
''Djantoeng Hati'' was written and directed by [[Njoo Cheong Seng]]. The film was produced by [[Fred Young (director)|Fred Young]] and SI Liem of Majestic Film.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djantoeng Hati}} It was the company's first production.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=240}} It starred A Sarosa, Rr Anggraini, [[Soerip]], and Ariati;{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djantoeng Hati}} Njoo's wife [[Fifi Young]], who had previously acted in all his films, was unable to act owing to health reasons.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=240}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=228–229}} Most of its stars were of noble (''ningrat'') descent, an attempt to draw middle-class audiences,{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djantoeng Hati}} while the story focused on students to draw educated viewers.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=240}}

The [[black-and-white]] film was shot by [[The Teng Chun]], one of Fred Young's friends from when he studied in the United States; The also allowed Majestic to use his studios in Batavia (modern-day Jakarta).{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=239}} The's brother Teng Liong served as [[sound director]]. The film featured seven ''[[kroncong]]'' songs by [[Koesbini|R. Koesbini]] which were sung by the main cast.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djantoeng Hati}}

==Release and reception==
''Djantoeng Hati'' was released in 1941.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djantoeng Hati}} Majestic's second film, ''[[Air Mata Iboe]]'' (''Mother's Tears'') was released later in 1941. It was their last production before the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] the following year.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=241}}

''Djantoeng Hati'' is likely a [[lost film]]. The American visual anthropologist [[Karl G. Heider]] writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost.{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=14}} However, JB Kristanto's ''Katalog Film Indonesia'' (''Indonesian Film Catalogue'') records several as having survived at [[Sinematek Indonesia]]'s archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the [[Netherlands Government Information Service]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=351}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1131">An '''entrée de ballet''' ("ballet entrance") is an autonomous scene of [[ballets de cour]], [[divertissement]], [[comédie-ballet]], [[opéra-ballet]], even [[tragédie lyrique]], which brings together several dancers in and out of the [[scenario]].

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, [[baroque dance]] distinguished several types of entrances, according to their character and step style: serious, severe, comical or grotesque. In his {{Interlanguage link multi|recueil de danses|fr}}, [[Raoul Auger Feuillet]] qualified the entrances he described according to the number of characters and sometimes their sex: ''entrance alone'', ''entrance of a woman'', ''entrance for two'', etc.

This choreographic form disappeared in the 1720s.

[[File:Kite shop in Lucknow.jpg|thumb|right|A kite shop in [[Lucknow]], India]]

'''Fighter kites''' are [[kite]]s used for the sport of kite fighting. Traditionally most are small, unstable single-line flat kites where line tension alone is used for control, and an [[Manja (kite)|abrasive line]] is used to cut down the string/line of other kites.

Kite fighting is done in many countries, but is particularly associated with [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]],  [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], [[Vietnam]], [[Korea]], [[Thailand]], and [[Brazil]].

== Materials ==
In most traditional fighter kite manufacture, the skins of kites are made from a lightweight thin paper and the spars are usually made from a lightweight and flexible wood, usually [[bamboo]].

In modern American fighters, the kite skins are made from a variety of synthetic materials – [[mylar]], aircraft insulation (orcon or insulfab), nylon, and [[polyester]] sheeting. The spine may still be bamboo, but often along with the bow is constructed of [[fiberglass]] or [[carbon fibre]].

=== Line ===
Historically, for most Asian type fighters, a thin cotton or hemp line is coated with a mixture of finely crushed glass and rice glue. In recent years, synthetic line has been coated with a variety of abrasives and stronger glue. Also, there have been some reports of metallic line being used. Some cultures use line that has metal knives attached to hook and cut the opponent's line.

Traditionally, players use a paste of some sort to toughen their line. The primary components of this include glue and crushed glass, but depending on personal preference other materials are added to improve the properties of the line.

In line touch competition, synthetic braided fishing line, 15 to 20&amp;nbsp;lb test, is used due to its low stretch and high strength for the line diameter and weight. Waxed cotton, linen line or Latex can also be used.

=== Names ===
* Spectra – A brand of fishing line used for American kite fighting.
* Power Pro – A very thin [0.25&amp;nbsp;mm diameter] braided fishing line used for American kite fighting.
* Manjha – The cutting line used in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
* Tar – The cutting line used in Afghanistan.
* Hilo de competencia o Hilo Curado – The cutting line used in Chile.
* Dore – (India and Pakistan) The string used to fly the kite. The sharper the string, the better it is.
* Pench – When two or more kites are fighting to cut one another. (India)
* Kai Po Chhe – When kite fighting to cut another one and it cut the winner says it loud "Kai Po Chhe" to announce the victory!
* Manjho – The cutting lines /thread called Manjho in Rajasthan(India)
* Gelasan – The cutting line /thread used in Indonesia
* Cerol – The cutting line /thread used in Brazil

== Bridle and tuning ==
Bridle position, spine curve, centre of gravity, and balance of tension on the spars all play a role in how the kite spins and tracks. Afghan and Indian fighter kites and their variants have their bridles attached in two places on the kite's spine. The first place is at the crossing of the bow and the spine. The second attachment is three-quarters to two-thirds of the total length of the spine from the nose of the kite. The length of the top line to the tow point is the length between the two bridle to spine connection points. The length of the bottom bridle to the tow point is between half an inch to two inches (1.2–5&amp;nbsp;cm) longer than the length of the two spine connections. The spine of the kite has a slight convex curve toward the face of the kite. To make the kite spin more, the upper bridle line is shortened: to make the kite spin less, the lower bridle line is shortened . Left and right tracking are adjusted by either placing weight on the tip of a wing, or by weakening the bow on the side that you want the kite to track towards. The design of the kite plays a role in the tendency for the kite to spin and pull, and how much wind the kite can handle. Bridling and tuning are only effective when the kite chosen is able to handle the amount of wind that it is being flown in. If the wind is so strong that the spine and bow are severely distorted, no amount of bridle tuning will help with making the kite controllable. A crude method of making a kite flyable in over-strong wind, used in India where the kites are cheap and regarded as disposable, is to burn small holes in the flying surface, typically using a cigarette.

== Kite fighting ==

When the kite is flown with the line taut, the kite is deformed by the wind pressure, giving it a degree of stability. When the line tension is reduced, either by letting out more line or by the flyer moving into wind, the kite will begin to become unstable and begin to rock from side to side, or in extreme cases even spin. By reapplying tension at the right moment, the kite will move in the direction that the flyer requires.

Although a spool that allows rapid winding and release of line is used, often the flyer will fly the kite by holding the line instead of the spool, with one or more assistants to help manage the slack line between the flyer and the spool.

== Line cutting contests ==
Many of these kites are flown with an abrasive coated line (manja). Most kites are flown with a set length of manja at the kite end. The manja is very sharp and to avoid getting hand injuries most competitors use ordinary string (saddi) for their hand position. Some cutting involves knives of some sort attached to the tail, line, or kite. Competition rules vary by geographical area. Two or more contestants fly their kites. The person who cuts the opponents line wins the fight. In multiple kite matches, the person with the last kite in the air is the winner.

The two most common types of cutting are done with abrasive coated line – release cutting or pull cutting. To release cut, once the lines are in contact, both parties start to play out line until one line is cut. In pull cutting, the flier quickly retrieves line until the opponents line is cut. There are many factors in who will win the event and include the size of the kite, the quality of the kite, the quality of the line, the quality of the abrasive on the line, the quality and size of the spool, the spool handler, initial contact, the skill of the person flying the kite, and the wind conditions.

== Capture or grounding competition ==
Two or more kites are flown. Competitors try to capture their opponents kite and bring it to the ground. The person or team who succeeds is the winner.

Expert kite fighters are able to cut their opponents line (manjha) and then encircle the trailing line (lubjow) of the cut kite. Once secured, the winner can then fly both kites and pull in the prize. Those not involved in the kite flying can be "kite runners" (Once a kite is cut, it no longer belongs to anyone until caught and claimed by the kite runner.). Many children die every year when they run into the path of vehicles or fall off roofs or, occasionally, with the fibre glass string cutting the flier's fingers or neck. The glass on the string is said to give the kite "cutting teeth".{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

== By country ==
The various countries where fighter kites are flown all have their own specific styles of kites, rules for fighting and traditions. In many cases there is a "season" or a special occasion particularly associated with kite flying.

=== Afghanistan ===
Kites used range from 0.5-meter to 1.5 meters across. The usual name for the sport is ''gudiparan bazi'' and for the cutting line ''tar''. As elsewhere, the line is traditionally made with a cotton line and coated with a mixture of crushed glass and rice glue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1592857,00.html|title=The Kite Maker|first=Aryn|last=Baker|date=22 February 2007|publisher=|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, nylon string with stronger glue is now often the preferred line. Kites can go up to 3,500 meters in height depending on the size of the kite.{{Citation needed|reason=up to 3,500 meters|date=January 2013}}

From 1996 to 2001, the Taliban government in Afghanistan outlawed kite fighting, and kite flying, by declaring it "un-Islamic". After the fall of the Taliban government kite fighting has returned to the country.

=== Bangladesh ===
[[File:Shakrain Kite Flyer.JPG|thumb|right|A kite fighter in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]]]]
As part of the [[Shakrain]] festival, people mostly from south [[Dhaka]] city engage in kite fighting. They fly kites mostly from the rooftops. The festival is held in the last day of the ''[[Poush]]'' month.

=== Brazil ===
In [[Brazil]], kite fighting is a very popular leisure activity for children, teenagers and even young adults, particularly boys and men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://streetsmartbrazil.com/flying-high-kids-kites/ "Flying High: Kids &amp; Kites"], 03.05.12, http://streetsmartbrazil.com/&lt;/ref&gt; As in other countries with similar traditions, injuries are common and motorcyclists in particular need to take precautions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirantesmt.com/2012/06/11/motorcyclists-worst-nightmare-brazils-deadly-kites/|title=A Motorcyclist's Worst Nightmare – Brazil's Deadly Kite lines.|first=Raf|last=Kiss|date=11 June 2012|publisher=|access-date=26 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827025737/http://www.mirantesmt.com/2012/06/11/motorcyclists-worst-nightmare-brazils-deadly-kites/|archive-date=27 August 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional kite (or ''"pipa"''), has pentagonal shape, but simple diamonds similar to fighter kites elsewhere are also very common.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bantamfilms.com/pipakite-flying/ "BRAZIL – PIPA / KITE FLYING"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Bantam Films&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/15/opinion/brazil-kite-fight.html "‘Kite Fight’"] 15 July 2014, NY Times&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Caribbean ===
Most Caribbean kites are hexagonal, flown with a tail, and instead of cutting with glass-coated line, use sharp objects (generally razor blades) attached to the tails to try to "koule" ([[Haitian Creole language|Creole]] for "drop") other kites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://loganinhaiti.blogspot.com/2007/05/kites.html |title=logan in haiti: Kites |publisher=Loganinhaiti.blogspot.com |date=16 May 2007 |accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drachen.org/journals/a09/Haiti.pdf|title=Memories of Kiteflying In Port au Prince|website=drachen.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601182937/http://www.drachen.org/journals/a09/Haiti.pdf|archivedate=1 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations of this style exist throughout the Caribbean – in [[Haiti]], [[Cuba]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dieppe-cerf-volant.org/dccv/cv/trad/ukniv3_tradcuba.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705185101/http://www.dieppe-cerf-volant.org/dccv/cv/trad/ukniv3_tradcuba.html |date=5 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gina Hsiung |url=http://www.csun.edu/~ghsiung/spotlt5.html |title=Spotlight page 5 – Cuban Kites |publisher=Csun.edu |date= |accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trinidad and Tobago]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.co.tt/sport/0,159023.html|title=Trinidad and Tobago's Newsday : newsday.co.tt :|first=Agile Telecom Ltd. and|last=Xidemia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Curaçao]] and [[Surinam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.chello.nl/h.hagg3/Surinam_Fighter/Suri_fighter_index.htm |title=The Surinam Fighter Kite |publisher=Members.chello.nl |date= |accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chile ===
Fighter kites are known as ''volantín''. They are square shaped, and made with light paper and bamboo sticks. Unlike other square fighter kites of the world, the Chilean ''volantín'' uses 3 support threads (two at the top and one at the bottom) for easier, more stable manoeuvre.  Whilst used widely for decorative purposes, the tail of the Chilean ''volantín'' is not used during competitive matches. The Chilean ''volantín'' can also vary in size, ranging from ''ñecla'' as the smallest size available, to ''pavo'' as the largest. However, in the context of kite fighting ''medio pavo'' or medium-sized kites are the most popular choice due to their more balanced performance in terms of speed, strength, and accuracy.
Practitioners of this activity usually begin fighting in September, when the spring winds are arriving to the Chilean coast. Clubs and professional associations, however, prefer to host tournaments throughout the drier summer months when the commercial kite season is over.

Chilean kite fighting practice include the use of a large reel, (''carrete''), for the manipulation and storage of the abrasive thread, and the use of wooden sticks for the manipulation of the ''carrete'' in turn. Therefore, it is possible for a skilled kite fighter to complete a match without ever touching the thread with their hands if their mastery of ''carrete'' usage is advanced enough. Since the mid 2000s, the use of ''carrete'' has become widespread in Latin America and Europe. Its convenience, durability and safety make it one of the most popular exports of the Chilean kite fighting culture.{{cn|date=January 2018}}
[[File:VolatinBanderaChile.JPG|thumb|two ''volantines'' with Chilean flag]]

=== India ===
Fighter kites are known as ''patang'' in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traditionalgames.in/home/property-games/pattam-pattam Pattum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426034920/http://www.traditionalgames.in/home/property-games/pattam-pattam |date=26 April 2012 }}, Indian Traditional Games&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/article1079932.ece "High up in the sky"],
Sunny Sebastian, The Times of Inda&lt;/ref&gt; In many others, kite flying takes place mainly during specific festivals particularly the spring festival known as [[Basant (season)|Basant]], during [[Makar Sankranti]] and more recently on [[Indian Independence Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/lord-of-the-strings-kite-wars-mark-indias-day-of-independence/article4481719/|title=Lord of the strings: Kite wars mark India’s day of independence|access-date=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
The Nagasaki Hata is similar to the Indian Patang, and it believed to have been introduced into Japan, from Indonesia, by Dutch traders. It is highly manoeuvrable and fought with glass coated line in line cutting contests in a similar way to kite fighting in many other countries.

Another type of kite fighting in Japan uses very large kites requiring teams. In these contests cutting line is not used, but instead kites are forced down. The festivals occur at [[Shirone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.erdoboy.com/kites/99shirone.htm |title=1999 Shirone Kite Battle Festival |publisher=Erdoboy.com |date= |accessdate=29 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710195311/http://www.erdoboy.com/kites/99shirone.htm |archivedate=10 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hamamatsu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shizuoka-guide.com/english/travel/shizuoka/Matsuri.html|title=Unique local festivals|work=Shizuoka Prefectural Tourism Association|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724084011/http://www.shizuoka-guide.com/english/travel/shizuoka/Matsuri.html|archive-date=24 July 2008|dead-url=yes|access-date=11 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rokkaku is 1-2m high hexagonal kite fought with teams of players flying each kite. Both the Rokkaku and the smaller rectangular Buka have been adopted and further developed by western kite enthusiasts.

=== Korea ===
The Korean fighter kite, the [[bang-pae yeon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsletter.drachen.org/July2006/july06-koreankites.html|title=Korean Kites at The Drachen Foundation|website=drachen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a rectangular, bowed "shield" kite with a hole in the middle of the sail. The frame uses five bamboo spars—one each across the top and the "waist" of the kite, a "spine," and two diagonals.

Although cutting line and fights are similar to other Asian fighter kites, a large spool is always used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drachen.org/pdf/Student-Readings/FighterKitesofKorea.pdf|title=Fighter Kites of Korea|website=drachen.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327085755/http://www.drachen.org/pdf/Student-Readings/FighterKitesofKorea.pdf|archivedate=27 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csun.edu/~ghsiung/fighters4.html|title=Korean, Japanese, Brazilian, Cuban, Thai and Malaysian Fighter Kites|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kite fighting in Nepal is especially active during the festival of [[Dashain]]. The skies are filled with colourful kites called ''changas'', made from Nepali ''lokta'' paper. The line used is coated in crushed glass to cut through the lines of rival kites. When a rival line has been cut, the victorious team shouts ''"chet"'' to claim their win over the other team.

=== Pakistan ===
Kite fighting is common in all over Pakistan, but mainly concentrated in cities of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]] region including [[Lahore]], [[Faisalabad]], [[Gujranwala]], [[Karachi]], [[Islamabad]] etc. While city of [[Lahore]] is considered as the capital of kite battling in South Asia. Kite flying is considered as the culture of [[Lahore]]. In the past, kite battling had a status of sports in Lahore, and those kite flyers were termed as "Khilari" or sportsman.

The kites that are manufactured for battling are very different from the conventional kites as they are especially designed and made for this purpose. Each of these kites has some special abilities for battling which make them unique from each other. According to history, Akbar the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor, who lived in his residence in Lahore from 1584 to 1598, enclosed the city with brick walls and 12 gates of considerable height and strength. One of the gates, called the "Moochi Darwaza" or "Cobbler Gateway," is the most popular site in Lahore to buy and sell Kite flying and firework materials. Kup, Patang, Guda, Nakhlaoo, Pan, Tukal, Muchal, Farfarata, etc. are some of the kites used in the battle, and they vary in balance, weight and speed through the air.

Kite flying is currently banned in some regions of Pakistan as some kite fliers engage in kite battles by coating their strings with glass or shards of metal, leading to injuries and death.

Threads for kite battling are manufactured using special glues, chemicals and crushed glass and are numbered based on their ability to cut other threads and to handle kite's weight. It is a social event in Pakistan that happens once a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paktribune.com/news/No-room-for-new-air-night-Basant-celebrations-in-Pakistan-MMA-114140.html |title=No room for new air night, Basant celebrations in Pakistan: MMA |publisher=PakTribune |date=28 July 2005 |accessdate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paktribune.com/news/Lahore-basant-festival-89888.html |title=Lahore basant festival |publisher=PakTribune |date= |accessdate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bassant in Lahore ====
City of [[Lahore]] is famous for its Bassant or Spring Festival throughout South Asian communities. People from all over [[Pakistan]] and few from neighbouring [[India]] come to Lahore to annually celebrate the two days long Bassant or Spring Festival. This festival is mostly held on last weekend of February or March. Festival is started on the night of Saturday, people battle White coloured kites, organise parties and arrange loud music on their rooftops throughout the night till morning. Whitepaper kite shimmer in the night sky diving soaring as rival flyers joust duels marked with the battle cries of ''"paich"'' (When kite flyers entangle the manja of their flying kites with each other and try to cut the string of the other by the pull or release method) and victory cries of ''"wo kaataa"''. Every success is celebrated with Bhangra Dance and beating of traditional drum.

Mainly centred in [[Lahore]] and [[Faisalabad]], people spend thousands of Rupees in preparing different types of kites and threads best suited to battle. Homes are also decorated with lights and decorations for evening festivities for the next day.

=== United States ===
The Korean shield kite (pangp'aeyon), the Japanese Rokkaku and Nagasaki Hata, the Brazilian Piao, the Chilean fighter kites have been used for demonstration purposes at various large kite festivals throughout the country.

Fighter kite competitors in the United States use a variety of innovative kites from a wide range of designs and materials for "line touch" and skills competitions. Fighter or "single line maneuverable" kites can be found flying throughout the country at many kite festivals.  A championship competition occurs at the annual convention of the American Kitefliers Association. http://kite.org/activities/events/aka-convention/

== Problems ==
=== Accidents ===
In India, Pakistan, Brazil and Chile, there have been reported accidents {{when|date=February 2018}} involving the abrasive coated cutting line.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} These accidents range in severity from small cuts on the fighter's fingers to a few reported deaths from contact with the line while riding motorcycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://tribune.com.pk/story/630081/gruesome-end-stray-kite-string-kills-two-year-old/|title=Stray kite line kills two-year-old|publisher=Express Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the fighting lines have evolved from the traditional cotton, rice and glass line to nylon or synthetic line coated with metallic or chemical abrasive compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sidharth |first1=Sidharth |title=Lal Kuan’s kite sellers cut the lethal cord |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/lal-kuans-kite-sellers-cut-the-lethal-cord/article24673358.ece |accessdate=2 October 2018 |work=The Hindu |date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent further injury, many{{which|date=December 2013}} countries have implemented restrictions or bans on the use of cutting line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Carabineros seizes more than 10 thousand yards of cutting line in Rancagua (in Spanish) |url=http://eltipografo.cl/2013/09/carabineros-incauta-mas-de-10-mil-yardas-de-hilo-curado-en-rancagua/ |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{who|date=December 2013}} have set limits on the materials used to make the line, others have mandated safety devices on motorcycles when riding during kite festivals. People have been injured while fixated on capturing a cut kite. Other injuries have been due to not paying attention to one's actions while watching battles. Most of these accidents are preventable when fighting is strictly controlled to a specific arena and proper safety gear is worn by the fighters. Other accidents have occurred due to the masses of people present during large kite festivals for which kite fighting has taken the blame.

=== Environmental difficulties ===
The kite strings left around after the fight can become stuck in tall trees and can stay there for long periods, impacting the natural aesthetic of parks and wilderness areas, thus degrading the experience of other park users from the trash that is left about.

Stray animals have also been known to get trapped and injured on kite lines that have fallen closer to the ground.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

'''GamerFitnation''' is a magazine website which focuses on technology, particularly video games, fitness, and healthy lifestyle information. The online media publication was founded by Antwand Pearman on April 6, 2010, to promote physical and mental health while gaming.&lt;ref name=Plus&gt;{{cite web|title=About GamerFitnation|url=https://plus.google.com/106438300140390089570/about|work=Google Plus|accessdate=November 14, 2013|author=GamerFitnation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mission&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Mission|url=http://gamerfitnation.com/our-mission/|work=GamerFitnation|accessdate=November 14, 2013|author=GamerFitnation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
GamerFitnation's primary objective is to provides mental and physical health information, with the assistance of health professionals. This includes recipes, exercise advice, reviews on more active games, and other health related information. They also provide news, reviews, releases, and other information that relates to gaming.&lt;ref name="Plus" /&gt; They clarify in their mission statement that this material could be sensitive, and therefore they present it with an emphasis on respectfulness.&lt;ref name="Mission" /&gt; Overall, the site promotes well being through a balanced lifestyle&lt;ref name="Plus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mission" /&gt;

== History ==
GamerFitnation originally was a Ning Site, serving as essentially a forum for users to discuss gaming and health issues and had the tag ”Finding the Balance between Gaming and Health.” The original GamerFitnation logo, which featured a medical caduceus made of video game peripherals, was created by Nathaniel Blasi. Eventually the site developed into a blog, and is currently a website. Writers are regarded as members of the press. In early 2012, the site re-branded, creating a new tag "Where Gaming and Health Come Together" and added "#BeGamerFit" to their slogan of "Don't Just Be Fit, Be Gamer Fit".&lt;ref name="Mission" /&gt; GamerFitnation also updated their logo with a design by Edward Ofori-Attah.

Antwand Pearman, founder and current president and Editor in Chief of GamerFitnation, has kept a hands-on approach with the site since creating it in 2010. In addition to writing articles and managing staff and the site, Pearman represents the company during most events and interviews. GamerFitnation's Executive Editor and Vice-President is Gregory Laporte, who has been with GamerFitnation since the early stages of the site.

=== Day of Cease Fire ===
On December 21, 2012, CEO of GamerFitnation, Antwand Pearman, called for a controversial online shooting game cease fire to honor the victims of the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]].

'''''Hare Ribbin'''''' is a 1944 [[animated]] [[short film]] in the ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' series, directed by [[Robert Clampett]] and featuring [[Bugs Bunny]].  The plot features Bugs' conflict with a red-haired hound dog, whom the rabbit sets out to evade and make a fool of using one-liners, reverse psychology, disguises and other tricks. It was released in theaters by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]] on June 24, 1944. The title is a pun on "hair ribbon".

It is also the first Warner Bros. cartoon to include Bugs' head in the open title sequence.

== Plot ==
The short opens with a dog with a Russian accent (a la [[Bert Gordon (comedian)|Bert Gordon]]'s "Mad Russian") hunting for a rabbit by sniffing a trail. He happens upon Bugs who begins to torment the dog. This prompts a chase, which leads to a nearby lake where the rest of the story continues. Most of the action takes place underwater.

Eventually, after a few gags, with Bugs dressed up as a mermaid, playing tag with the dog and throwing the dog into a rock, leaving his feet sticking out and Bugs disguising himself as Elmer Fudd, the dog corners Bugs and demands he gives him a rabbit sandwich. Bugs obliges, and the rabbit places himself between two giant slices of loaf bread with his legs curled next to his body. The dog takes a bite and Bugs screams and fakes his death. The dog becomes instantly grief-stricken and sobs, declaring that he should be the one to die. With this statement, Bugs springs back to life asking, "Ehhhh...do you mean it?", and obliges the dog's death wish (see [[#Censorship and alternative endings|Censorship and alternative endings]] below). The dog falls to the ground, Bugs plants a flower on his chest and dances away into the distance. As the cartoon is about to "iris out" the dog sits up (revealing that he is still alive), holds the iris before it closes, and declares "''This'' shouldn't even happen to a dog!".&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen (2004), p. 36-37&lt;/ref&gt; He then lets the iris go, but it closes on his nose in the process, making him yelp in pain.

==Cast== 
* [[Mel Blanc]] as [[Bugs Bunny]]
* Sam Wolfe as Russian Dog (uncredited)

== Analysis ==
Michael S. Shull and David E. Wilt consider it ambiguous if this cartoon contain a World War II-related reference. While underwater, Bugs disguises himself as a [[mermaid]]. The dog transforms into a [[torpedo]] to pursue "her".&lt;ref name="Shull"&gt;Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

The two alternate versions of the ending were based on the perception of someone that Bugs could not be seen killing another animal. This someone was perhaps a studio administrator.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen (2004), p. 36-37&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening gag of this cartoon in which the dog sniffs around Bugs' armpits and then exclaims "B.O!" (body odor) in a voice similar to that of a foghorn is a parody of a then popular radio ad for Life Buoy Soap.

Curiously, part of the speech from one of the Japanese soldiers from the episode ''[[Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips]]'' is also heard in the background, when Bugs faked being a waiter asking for a rabbit sandwich.

== Censorship and alternative endings ==
[[File:The Original Endings to Hare Ribbin'.PNG|thumb|left|150px|The two alternate endings to ''Hare Ribbin&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''. Each depicts the dog's death via gun violence, which is today considered too harsh for family audience.]] This cartoon short holds the distinction of having two endings, both of which are too violent by today's standards to be shown on children/family-friendly television. In both endings, the Russian Dog, distraught over Bugs' "death" and guilt-ridden, wishes he were dead too. Bugs then quotes the Mad Russian, saying, "eh, do you mean it?" After that scene comes one of two different scenarios:

The original theatrical ending: Bugs gives the dog a gun so he can commit suicide by shooting himself in the head&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen (2004), p. 36-37&lt;/ref&gt;—once played in theaters to a general audience, is now commonly cut from television versions on network and cable TV, although it has aired uncensored (as recently as 2015) on the Canadian cable channel [[Teletoon Retro]].  This ending was also aired uncensored on an episode of Cartoon Network's ''[[The Bob Clampett Show]]'', as well as the Cartoon Network's New Year's Day Looney Tunes marathons in 2009 and 2010. The edit occurs between the scene where Bugs says "Do you mean it?" and the dog laying down, making it seem as if the dog had dropped dead out of guilt without shooting himself.

The "director's cut" ending: Bugs pulls out a gun, shooting the dog through the mouth. Bugs then dances away, and the dog gets up to deliver the last line: "This shouldn't happen to a dog."&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen (2004), p. 36-37&lt;/ref&gt; was never shown in theaters or on television, despite that the episode of Cartoon Network's ''The Bob Clampett Show'' that aired "Hare Ribbin'" with its general release ending mentioned that "Hare Ribbin'" had an alternate ending (this one) that was never shown, and due to its violence, never will be. The director's cut version was first discovered on the fifth volume of the laserdisc set of "The Golden Age of Looney Tunes Volume 5" and the entire cartoon with the director's cut part is now on the fifth volume of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection DVD set as a special feature.

Other scenes included in the director's cut is an extended scene of the Dog sniffing for Bugs in the beginning of the film.  Also when the dog turns around and sees Bugs in his mermaid costume, in the original cut the Dog turns into a torpedo right when Bugs whistles at him. The director's cut adds a scene where the dog starts heavy breathing before turning into a torpedo, with an extended version of them playing tag.

One scene that is not used in the director's cut is when we see Bugs move his body up in the bread so he's not actually eaten by the dog. Based on the slight difference in animation style from the rest of the film, both this and the scene when Bugs hands him the gun appear to be re-shoots, added before the theatrical release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://looney.goldenagecartoons.com/ltcuts/h/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202210720/http://looney.goldenagecartoons.com/ltcuts/h/ |archivedate=2010-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Availability ==
"The Golden Age of Looney Tunes Volume 5" laserdisc set has the "director's cut" version of this cartoon, unrestored.
The [[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5|fifth volume]] of the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection]]'' DVD set has the original cut of ''Hare Ribbin''', restored and remastered, and the director's cut as a special feature, unrestored and unremastered (you can tell the difference between both cuts by the tinting of the color).

'''''Hellraiser''''' is a [[Horror fiction|horror]] [[Media franchise|franchise]] that consists of ten films, a series of books, various comic books, and additional merchandise and media. The franchise is based on the [[novella]] ''[[The Hellbound Heart]]'' by English author [[Clive Barker]], who would go on to write and direct the adaptation of his story, titled ''[[Hellraiser]]''. The films, as well as the comic book series, continually feature the [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobite]] [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]].

The series’ storyline focuses on [[Lemarchand's box|a puzzle box]] that opens a gateway to the [[Hell]]-like realm of the Cenobites, an order of formerly human monsters who harvest human souls to torture in [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] experiments. Although Clive Barker wrote the original story, and also wrote and directed the first film, he has not written or directed any of the succeeding sequels. Barker stated that he signed away the story and character rights to the production company before the first film, not realizing what a great success it would be.&lt;ref&gt;''Loveline'', May 15, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==

=== Overview ===
In the original ''[[Hellraiser]]'' (1987), Frank Cotton ([[Sean Chapman]]) escapes from the [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobite]]s when his brother Larry ([[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andrew Robinson]]) spills his own blood on the spot where Frank died opening [[Lemarchand's box|a puzzle box]] that opened a gateway to the Cenobites. With the help of Larry's wife Julia ([[Clare Higgins]]), Frank begins regenerating his body with the blood of victims that Julia supplies him. Larry's daughter, [[Kirsty Cotton|Kirsty]] ([[Ashley Laurence]]), accidentally unleashes the Cenobites, but makes a deal to deliver Frank to them in exchange for her own life. After taking Frank, the Cenobites go back on their deal and try and take Kirsty as well. Solving the puzzle box, Kirsty sends the Cenobites back to Hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Clive Barker (Director)|title=Hellraiser|medium=DVD|location=United Kingdom|publisher=[[New World Pictures]]|date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1988, a sequel titled ''[[Hellbound: Hellraiser II]]'' follows Dr. Philip Channard ([[Kenneth Cranham]]) as he resurrects Julia, who was stuck in Hell with the Cenobites. Kirsty is pulled back into the Cenobite world, where the demons decide to keep her, but, having discovered the human identity of the Cenobites early, Kirsty appeals to their latent humanity, specifically the Cenobite leader [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]] ([[Doug Bradley]]). Pinhead decides to release her, but he and his followers are killed by Channard, who has become a Cenobite himself. With help of a teenage girl, Tiffany ([[Imogen Boorman]]), who unknowingly assisted Channard in opening the box, Kirsty and Tiffany escape the Cenobite world and close the gateway behind them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Tony Randel (Director)|title=Hellbound: Hellraiser II|medium=DVD|location=United Kingdom|publisher=New World Pictures|date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth]]'' (1992), the revelation of Pinhead's humanity has resulted in a schism, splitting him in two—his human self, [[World War I]] veteran Elliot Spencer, and Pinhead, now a living embodiment of Spencer's [[Id, ego and super-ego|id]]. While Spencer is trapped in [[limbo]], Pinhead is trapped, along with the puzzle box, in the surface of an intricately carved pillar, a relic of the Cenobite realm. The pillar is found by a night club owner, J.P. Monroe (Kevin Bernhardt), who begins assisting Pinhead in his resurrection. A television reporter, Joey Summerskill ([[Terry Farrell (actress)|Terry Farrell]]), begins to learn about Pinhead and the puzzle box, which leads her to Monroe's night club. Pinhead is eventually resurrected, and begins creating new Cenobite followers in an effort to establish Hell on Earth. Joey manages to reunite Spencer and Pinhead, fusing them back into one entity, and is able to use the puzzle box to send Pinhead back to his dimension. Afterward, Joey submerges the box into freshly laid cement at a construction site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Anthony Hickox (Director)|title=Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth|medium=DVD|location=United States|publisher=Dimension Films|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[Hellraiser: Bloodline]]'' (1996) tells the story of the creator of the puzzle box, referred to as the Lament Configuration. A toymaker named Philip Lemarchand ([[Bruce Ramsay]]) is commissioned by the Duc de L'Isle (Mickey Cottrell), a wealthy Aristocrat and master of the dark arts, to create the box as a gateway to Hell so that de L'Isle can enslave a demon. Beginning in the distant future, and tracing the history of the box from its creation in 1784, ''Bloodline'' shows how the Lemarchand family attempts to close the box forever after learning what L'Isle uses it for. Eventually, Dr. Paul Merchant creates the Elysium Configuration, a space station capable of closing the gateway for good, and he traps Pinhead inside and destroys him and the box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Kevin Yagher (Director)|title=Hellraiser: Bloodline|medium=DVD|location=United States|publisher=Dimension Films|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Hellraiser: Inferno]]'' (2000), the first of the succeeding sequels to be [[direct-to-video]], follows corrupt police Detective Joseph Thorne ([[Craig Sheffer]]) as he discovers the puzzle box while investigating a series of ritualistic murders. As time goes on he begins to uncover clues that suggest that he is the killer. Eventually, Pinhead appears and informs Thorne that the events of the movie have been transpiring in Thorne's own personal Hell, and that he will be reliving the same series of events for eternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Scot Derrickson (Director)|title=Hellraiser: Inferno|medium=DVD|location=United States|publisher=Dimension Films|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''[[Hellraiser: Hellseeker]]'' (2002), [[Ashley Laurence]] returns to play Kirsty Cotton. In the opening moments, she and her husband, Trevor ([[Dean Winters]]), end up in a car accident that kills Kirsty. One month later, Trevor wakes up in a hospital, but because of a head injury, his memory is uncertain and he cannot distinguish between fantasy and reality. As he begins to uncover evidence that he was having a series of affairs, he also comes under suspicion for orchestrating the crash that killed his wife. Pinhead appears in the end, and informs Trevor that he was the one that died in the car crash, his own plot to murder Kirsty for her inheritance backfired when Kirsty offered the Cenobites the lives of Trevor, his mistresses and his co-conspirators in exchange for her own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Rick Bota (Director)|title=Hellraiser: Hellseeker|medium=DVD|location=United States|publisher=Dimension Films|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Hellraiser: Deader]]'' (2005), reporter Amy Klein ([[Kari Wuhrer]]) is sent to [[Bucharest]] to investigate an underground suicide cult founded by a descendant of Philip Lemarchand, who claims to be able to bring back the dead and who believes that it is his birthright to open the puzzle box and control the Cenobites. She is gradually drawn into their world and eventually sees no way out other than to join them. In the end she opens the puzzle box, summoning up Pinhead and the Cenobites, who kill everyone for attempting to invade their world. To prevent Pinhead from taking her soul, Amy kills herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Rick Bota (Director)|title=Hellraiser: Deader|medium=DVD|location=United States|publisher=Dimension Films|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[Hellraiser: Hellworld]]'' (2005) is set in the "real world," in which  ''Hellraiser'' has spawned a successful [[MMORPG]]. Five friends mourning the death of one of their fellow players—who committed suicide after becoming obsessed with the game—receive in-game invitations to a party at the [[Leviathan]] House. At the house, the host of the party ([[Lance Henriksen]]) takes them on a tour of the many layers of the home, after which they are picked off one-by-one by the host or Pinhead. The final two victims ultimately realize that most of the events of the movie have been a hallucination, after the host—the father of their deceased friend, who blames his son's fellow players for not breaking his addiction to the game—drugged them and buried them alive. The police rescue the surviving teenagers, Chelsea ([[Katheryn Winnick]]) and Jake ([[Christopher Jacot]]), while the host escapes to a decrepit motel with a suitcase of his son's belongings. The host discovers a real puzzle box inside, and upon opening it is killed by Pinhead and a pair of Cenobites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Rick Bota (Director)|title=Hellraiser: Hellworld|medium=DVD|location=United States|publisher=Dimension Films|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a ninth film was released to a single theater in California for a crew showing that was ostensibly open to the public. ''[[Hellraiser: Revelations]]'' is the first film not to feature Doug Bradley as Pinhead and was shot in two weeks for $300,000. It was suggested by [[Bloody Disgusting]] that the film was only shot so that [[The Weinstein Company]] would not lose its filming rights before it could produce a remake of the original. The film was released on DVD on 18 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0056P6SOG |title=Hellraiser: Revelations: Steven Brand, Clyde McNight, Sebastian Roberts, Victor Garcia: Movies &amp; TV |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A tenth film, ''[[Hellraiser: Judgment]]'', began filming in early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=147 : Hellraiser Judgement’s Paul T.

On January 28, 2010, Camelot Entertainment Group, Inc. announced that the distributor was working on ''Unearthed: The Hellraiser Saga'', a documentary on the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35586/new-hellraiser-and-zombie-themed-documentaries-coming|title=New Hellraiser and Zombie Themed Documentaries Coming|publisher=Bloody-Disgusting}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be directed by Stefan Hutchinson and written by Ryan Rotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35751/hellraiser-documentary-details|title=Hellraiser Documentary Details|publisher=DreadCentral}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 October 2010, it was officially announced{{by whom?|date=July 2017}} that [[Patrick Lussier]] and [[Todd Farmer]] were to direct and write, respectively, a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the ''Hellraiser'' franchise. The film's story would differ from the original film, as Lussier and Farmer did not want to retell the original story out of respect for Clive Barker's work. The film was to instead focus on the world and function of the puzzle box. However, in 2011, Farmer confirmed that both he and Lussier were dropped from the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horror-movies.ca/2011/09/hellraiser-remake-halloween-3d|title=Exclusive: Hellraiser Remake &amp; Halloween 3D Updates|publisher=Horror-Movies.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=20823|title='Hellraiser' Remake Is Stalling Again|publisher=ShockTillYouDrop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Super 3D Noah's Ark]]'' began as a ''Hellraiser'' license for the Nintendo Entertainment System.  The team eventually abandoned the ''Hellraiser'' license and converted it into a simplistic Bible-based game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/247300/How_a_Hellraiser_tiein_became_Super_3D_Noahs_Ark.php|title=How a Hellraiser tie-in became Super 3D Noah's Ark|last=Durham|first=Gabe|work=[[Gamasutra]]|date=2015-06-30|accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the release of ''Bloodline'', Magnet Interactive Studios developed an unrelated video game called ''Hellraiser: Virtual Hell''.

== Reception==
Katie Rife of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote that the ''Hellraiser'' films intentionally alienate casual viewers and instead appeal to the type of fan she compares to a "humorless art student" who prefers dark poetry to the more fraternity-oriented [[slasher film]]s.  Continuing the metaphor, Rife wrote, "Even when its ambition exceeds its budget—which is often—it's trying to say something with its occult art projects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/watching-all-9-hellraiser-movies-exercise-masochis-211060|title=Watching all 9 Hellraiser movies is an exercise in masochism|last=Rife|first=Katie|work=[[The A.V.

'''Hexage''' is a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[video game]] developer, based in [[Mníšek pod Brdy]] but registered in the [[United Kingdom]]. The company has produced multiple titles for mobile devices. A few of studio's games have surpassed a million downloads. The most successful title is [[Reaper: Tale of a Pale Swordsman]].&lt;ref name=MUJS&gt;{{cite web|last=Dočkal|first=Jakub|title=Rozhovor s...

The company was founded in 2009. It originally focused on mobile devices but in 2013 the company released its games for Windows. [[Reaper: Tale of a Pale Swordsman]] even became available on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] as it succeeded on Steam Greenlight. The company also tried to release Radiant Defense on Steam before, and it got released as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.databaze-her.cz/vyvojari/hexage/ |title=Hexage – Databáze-her.cz |publisher=Databaze-her.cz |date= |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=93125741 |title=Steam Greenlight :: Radiant Defense |publisher=Steamcommunity.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://win8review.com/2013/06/a-review-of-hexage-games-for-windows-8/ |title=A Review of Hexage Games for Windows 8 - Windows 8 Review |publisher=Win8review.com |date=2013-06-02 |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://technet.idnes.cz/aplikace-po-windows-8-0rz-/sw_internet.aspx?c=A130408_160158_sw_internet_vse |title=Aplikace pro Windows 8 dělá v Česku i dvanáctiletý.

Even though the company is based in the Czech Republic, it built an image of British company, since in 2009 it was impossible to release video games from the Czech Republic on Google Play. The company develops its games with its own devices.&lt;ref name="MUJS"/&gt; The soundtracks for all the games are by Kubatko&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kubatko.bandcamp.com|title=Hexage Games Soundtrack II, by Kubatko|website=Kubatko|access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History timeline==
{{HistBaseball nav}}

===Early history===
[[File:U.S. Marine baseball team.jpg|left|thumb|[[United States Marine Corps]] baseball team in [[Managua, Nicaragua]], 1915.]]
Baseball was introduced in the 1880s by [[Albert Addlesberg]], an [[United States|American]] businessman living in [[Bluefields]].&lt;ref name="A Short History of Nicaraguan Baseball"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicanews.com.ni/nn12/bball.html |title=A Short History of Nicaraguan Baseball |author= |date= |work= |publisher=nicanews.com.ni |accessdate=February 13, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526004940/http://www.nicanews.com.ni/nn12/bball.html |archivedate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the area around Bluefields was known as the autonomous [[Mosquito Coast|Mosquito Reserve]] and a strong British influence in the area was evidenced by the popularity of [[cricket]]. Addlesberg convinced two of the most popular cricket clubs to switch to baseball and supplied the locals with equipment he imported from [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name="A Short History of Nicaraguan Baseball"/&gt; Two teams were created in {{baseball year|1887}}, the Southern and Four Roses.&lt;ref name="ucis.pitt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A Short History of Nicaraguan Baseball"/&gt; They began to play in {{baseball year|1888}} and baseball has been played on the Mosquito Coast almost continuously since that time, but the entire region has long since been incorporated into the Republic of Nicaragua. The first 'official' game took place in {{baseball year|1891}} between Managua and Granada.&lt;ref name="ucis.pitt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A Short History of Nicaraguan Baseball"/&gt; [[Carter Donaldson]], who was the U.S. Consul in Nicaragua at the time, founded the first continuous team in 1904.&lt;ref name="A Short History of Nicaraguan Baseball"/&gt; [[United States Marines]] stationed in Nicaragua in the early part of the 20th century were also credited for bringing the sport to the country, and popularizing it in the area.&lt;ref name="marines"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Le-Pa/Nicaraguan-Americans.html |title=Nicaraguan Americans: Sports |author=Stefan Smagula |date= |work=Countries and their Culture |publisher=veryculture.com |accessdate=February 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ucis.pitt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=si&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119763/index.htm |title=While War Rages, Baseball Remains The National Passion In Nicaragua |author=Leslie Bornstein |date=August 19, 1985 |work=Sports Illustrated |publisher=sportsillustrated.cnn.com |accessdate=February 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s and 1970s===
Professional baseball came to an end in Nicaragua in 1967, after years of political and economic problems.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt; In the 1970s, however, baseball again became popular after the success of the [[Nicaragua national baseball team]].&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;

===1980s and 1990s===
In the 1980s, popularity of baseball in the country began to decline.&lt;ref name="William R.

===Present day===
In the spring of 2004, professional baseball returned to Nicaragua for the first time since 1967.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt; In a typical modern-day game, teams have sets of [[cheerleaders]], as well as team [[mascots]], and marching bands who play throughout the game.&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=2762836&amp;type=story |title=To play 'pro' ball, they went to Nicaragua |author=Amy K.

[[File:Just a Gigolo (1932).webm|thumb|thumbtime=216|start=214|end=429|''Just a Gigolo'' (1932)]]

'''Irène Bordoni''' (16 January 1885 – 19 March 1953) was a [[Corsica]]n-[[United States|American]] actress and singer.

==Early years==
Bordoni was born in [[Ajaccio]], [[Corsica]] to Sanveur Bordoni, a [[tailor]], and Marie Lemonnier. The 19th-century painter [[Francis Davis Millet|Francis Millet]] was a great uncle who died in the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'' disaster.&lt;ref&gt;''Great Stars of the American Stage'' by Daniel C. Blum, c. 1952 orig. (this version 1954 edition) ''Profile #97''&lt;/ref&gt; She became a [[child actor]], performing in Paris on stage and in [[silent film]]s for a few years, having signed with theatrical agent [[André Charlot]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, James Ross, ''André Charlot'', 2005, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;   Bordoni made her first appearance on the stage at the age of thirteen, at the ''Variétés'', Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Group, Gale, ''Who Was Who in the Theatre, 1912–1976: A Biographical Dictionary of Actors'', 1978, page 244&lt;/ref&gt;

She went to the United States on 28 December 1907, in steerage on the ''S. S. La Provence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ellisisland.org|title=The Statue of Liberty &amp; Ellis Island|work=ellisisland.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bordoni's year of birth is given in standard theatrical biographies as 1895, but her real birth year is 1885. She was 22 on the ship's passenger list when she arrived in the United States in 1907. She went first to [[Reno, Nevada]], where her father had reportedly settled previously.&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, Barry, ''Ellis Island's Famous Immigrants'', 2008, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadway==
[[File:Irène Bordoni 02.jpg|thumb|Irène Bordoni on stage]]
Bordoni made her Broadway debut in a [[Shubert brothers]] production of ''Broadway to Paris'' at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] and was a successor to [[Anna Held]] as Broadway's idea of French piquancy and Continental flavor.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times,'' 4 October 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;  She was in ''Miss Information'' (1915) and successive productions of ''[[Hitchy-Koo]]'' (1917 and 1918).&lt;ref&gt;Green, Stanley, ''Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre'' 1980, page 40&lt;/ref&gt; 1919 audiences saw Bordoni in ''Sleeping Partners'' co-starring with [[H. B. Warner]] at the Bijou.&lt;ref&gt;''The Green Book Magazine'', 1919, page 177&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1920 her "captivating voice and presence" graced ''As You Were'' at the Central Theater.&lt;ref&gt;Mantle, Burns, ''The Best Plays of 1919 to 1920 and the Year Book of the Drama in America'', 2005, page 420&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Independent'', 1920, page 382&lt;/ref&gt;

Bordoni introduced [[George Gershwin]]'s hit song "[[Do It Again (George Gershwin and Buddy DeSylva song)|Do It Again]]" with vivacity and verve in the 1922 Broadway show ''The French Doll'' at the Lyceum.&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, Howard, ''George Gershwin: His Life and Work'', 2006; page 263&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the show became her nickname. She also starred in ''Little Miss Bluebeard'' (1923) and ''Naughty Cinderella'' (1925) by [[Avery Hopwood]], about which the theatre critic for the ''New York Times'' said, "Of Miss Bordoni one can report only what has been reported many times. Her voice, her accent and particularly her reeling eyes are, as ever, unmistakably attractive."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', 23 November 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noted for her seductive brown eyes and coquettish personality, Irène Bordoni is probably best remembered from musical theatre as the star of the 1928 [[Cole Porter]] musical ''[[Paris (1928 musical)|Paris]]'' that featured the song "[[Let's Do It (Let's Fall In Love)]]" which became Porter's first big success. Bordoni would record and sing many times live and on radio another Cole Porter song, "[[Let's Misbehave]]" with [[Irving Aaronson|Irving Aaronson and His Commanders]] dance band. The song has been included on the soundtrack of five motion pictures including ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'' (1972), ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1981 film)|Pennies from Heaven]]'' (1981) and ''[[Bullets Over Broadway]]'' (1994). Porter later included Bordoni's name in the lyrics of his song ''[[You're the Top]]'' ("you're the eyes of Irène Bordoni") from the musical ''[[Anything Goes]]'' (1934).{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Throughout her Broadway career, Bordoni was renowned for wearing only the most stylish of clothes, including costumes by [[Erté]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gown for Madame Bordoni'' circa 1925|url=http://banyan.library.unlv.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/showgirls&amp;CISOPTR=206}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, Bordoni appeared in [[Lucky Strike]] cigarette advertisements with the quip, ''I smoke a Lucky to keep petite,'' which was said to have contributed to the tremendous increase in women's smoking in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease'', page 360; American Neurological Association, New York Neurological Association, Philadelphia Neurological Society, Chicago Neurological Society, Boston.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Bordoni wore her hair with trademark bangs, which she helped to popularize; indeed her 'look' was successfully emulated not only by her admirers but also by late 1920s budding Broadway starlet [[Claudette Colbert]]. She was stockbroker W. D. Hutton's first customer when he opened his branch office on West 57th Street.&lt;ref&gt;Geisst, Charles R., ''100 years of Wall Street'', 2000, p. 69&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s, she was a guest singer on many variety programs as well as being featured on The RKO Hour.&lt;ref&gt;Slide, Anthony, ''Great Radio Personalities in Historic Photographs'', 1982, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Bordoni pleased audiences on both sides of the Atlantic, as with [[Irving Berlin]]'s ''It's a Lovely Day Tomorrow'' in London's West End in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Lyrics of Irving Berlin'' by Irving Berlin, Robert Kimball and Linda Emmet (2005), p. 339&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Filmography==
{{Main|Irène Bordoni filmography}}

==In Hollywood==
Bordoni made her Hollywood debut in [[Warner Brothers]] ''Show of Shows'' (1928).&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, Frank Cullen, Florence Hackman and Donald McNeilly, ''Vaudeville, Old &amp; New''; p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 her Broadway play ''Paris'' was adapted to a talkie, also called ''[[Paris (1929 film)|Paris]]'', for which she reprised her starring role. The film used the [[Vitaphone]] [[sound-on-disc]] sound system and was shot in early [[Technicolor]]. That year Bordoni also performed "Just an Hour of Love" (by Al Bryan and Ed Ward) for the [[Warner Brothers]] film ''[[The Show of Shows]]'' produced by [[Darryl F. Zanuck]]. In 1932 [[Max Fleischer]] featured her in his follow-the-bouncing-ball Screen Song cartoon "Just A Gigolo".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Her status as a major star of the American stage was such that in his song "[[You're The Top]]", [[Cole Porter]] included the reference "You’re the eyes of Irene Bordoni". During the 1930s, she continued to perform on stage and starred in another Warner Brothers musical comedy film. In 1940, Bordoni was part of another major Broadway success with the [[Irving Berlin]] musical ''[[Louisiana Purchase (musical)|Louisiana Purchase]]'' and again reprised her role in the [[Paramount Pictures]] film ''[[Louisiana Purchase (film)|Louisiana Purchase]]'' (1941) with [[Bob Hope]]. She had another success in the role of "Bloody Mary" in the 1951 national tour of the musical ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Personal life==
Bordoni was married to actor Edgar Becman whom she divorced in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Actress Asks Divorce. Miss Bordoni Also Sues Gilda Darthy for Alienation |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E00E1DB133BE03ABC4952DFB166838C609EDE&amp;legacy=true |quote= |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=July 11, 1917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She married again  on 24 October 1918&lt;ref&gt;Ellis Island Records&lt;/ref&gt; to Broadway producer and lyricist [[E. Ray Goetz]] who produced many of her Broadway shows (and whose sister [[Dorothy Goetz]] was [[Irving Berlin]]'s first wife)&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Charles, ''Cole Porter: A Biography'', 1979, page 94&lt;/ref&gt; but they divorced in 1929.

At the height of her international appeal she maintained homes in increasingly stylish New York neighborhoods: from 230 [[West End Avenue]] to 108 East 78th Street to 104 East 40th Street — as well as in Paris and [[Monte Carlo]]. She invested in real estate in [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] in the 1920s during the Florida land boom. Bordoni was later associated with theatrical agent and producer Avery Galen Bogue (1896–1951).

She died on 19 March 1953 at Jewish Memorial Hospital in [[Manhattan, New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Irene Bordoni obituary, ''Billboard'', 28 March 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Irene Bordoni Dies in Hospital at 59.

'''''Italian Spiderman''''' is an Australian film [[parody]] of Italian action–adventure films of the 1960s and 1970s, first released on YouTube in 2007. The parody purports to be a "lost Italian film" by Alrugo Entertainment, an Australian film-making collective formed by Dario Russo, Tait Wilson, David Ashby, Will Spartalis and Boris Repasky.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23730619-12332,00.html The Australian]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ostensibly an Italian take on the comic book superhero [[Spider-Man]], the film is a reference to foreign movies that misappropriate popular American superheroes such as the Turkish film "[[3 Dev Adam]]", and licensed series such as the Japanese TV series "[[Japanese Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]", both of which alter the character of Spider-Man for foreign audiences. Other notable entries include the Indian version of ''[[Superman (1987 film)|Superman]]'' (1987),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-unknown-movies.com/unknownmovies/reviews/rev266.html The Unknown Movies]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Three Fantastic Supermen]]'' (1967) and ''La Mujer Murcielago (The Batwoman)'' (1968).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bleedingskull.com/vhs/mujer.html Bleeding Skull]&lt;/ref&gt; It also resembles the movie ''Bathman dal pianeta Eros'' (1982).

A trailer was released, followed by a full-length feature made up of ten mini-episodes.

==Plot==

In the middle of a party, an [[asteroid]] from a distant galaxy falls to Earth and is taken by professor Bernardi (Carmine Russo) for research. He discovers the asteroid has a substance that can create [[cloning|duplicates]] from any living being and decides that Italian Spiderman (David Ashby, credited as "Franco Franchetti"), a fat, rude, chain-smoking, and powerful superhero, is the only man capable of holding custody of the valuable asteroid.

As soon as Professor Bernardi gives Italian Spiderman the asteroid, he is attacked by the terrible Captain Maximum (Leombruno Tosca) who is interested in using the asteroid for his own evil plans. Foiled in his attempt to steal the asteroid from Bernardi, he transforms the Professor into a snake. Captain Maximum later intercepts the Italian Spiderman and takes the asteroid, although he gives Italian Spiderman a chance to win it by beating Maximum in a [[Surfing|surf]] contest. When Captain Maximum notices the obviously superior surfing skills of Italian Spiderman, Maximum attempts to win by cheating. His efforts fail, however, as Italian Spiderman summons the help of penguins (which hurl themselves at Captain Maximum and his henchwomen) and wins.
When Italian Spiderman returns home, he is again attacked by Captain Maximum's henchmen, where a tranquiliser dart causes the hero to collapse.

Waking up in Captain Maximum's lair he witnesses how the professor is forced to use the powers of duplication on one of Captain Maximum's henchmen. Italian Spiderman is forced to watch as the professor is shot by Maximum. The furious Italian Spiderman attacks Maximum's henchmen, killing many in a surprisingly gory battle sequence. Despite Italian Spiderman's efforts the Professor dies but in his last moments gives the Italian Spiderman the potion.  Italian Spiderman again attacks the headquarters of Captain Maximum. Despite having the potion, Italian Spiderman overwhelms by his powers alone the newfound army (showing in the process to have a venomous bite and removable moustaches that can double as razor-sharp [[boomerang]]s). Later, Italian Spiderman returns home with the Professor's niece, Jessica (Susanna Dekker). When a gigantic Captain Maximum lays siege to the city, Italian Spiderman finally drinks the potion, growing to the same height of Captain Maximum and battling him until the titles roll.

The project began as a trailer for a non-existent film, produced as a student film at [[Flinders University]] by director Dario Russo for his final year Screen Production project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,22880792-5006346,00.html The Advertiser, 5 December 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The "trailer" was shot, over the course of one day, on 16&amp;nbsp;mm film using an older style camera to achieve an authentic look for the films of that era.

The trailer stars "Franco Franchetti" (David Ashby) as "Italian Spiderman" and features "Jessica" portrayed by actress Susanna Dekker, in the infamous scene with the line "Fammi un macchiato, pronto". 

Publicized as an actual lost Italian action film from the late 1960s, the film was later uploaded onto YouTube on 8 November 2007 where it has gained a massive cult following with 6.5 million hits as of 10 September 2018. With some of mainstream media taking interest in the film, this led to the [[South Australian Film Corporation]] giving the filmmakers funding for ten more short films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2008/s2269067.htm The World Today, ABC Radio, Monday, 9 June 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first installment of the "feature film" premiered across the Internet on 22 May 2008; further instalments followed on a weekly basis.

The series was well-received, but ended on a [[cliffhanger]]. The May 2010 announcement of the end of Alrugo Entertainment cast doubt on the possible continuation of the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alrugo.blogspot.com/2010/05/fare-well-alrugo.html Alrugo finishing notice]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October 2011, a video announcement was made declaring the end of the Italian Spiderman project and the formation of a new production company between Dario Russo and David Ashby, called Dinosaur. The same video also officially announced the duo's television show, ''[[Danger 5]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLA2fHIcq94&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abhisit offer Kathina robes.jpg|thumb|Former Prime Minister [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]] of Thailand offers Kathina robes to monks at 2010 Kathin.]]
'''Kathina''' is a Buddhist festival which comes at the end of [[Vassa]], the three-month rainy season retreat for [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhists]] in [[Bangladesh]] (known as Kaṭhina Cībar Dān), [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]], India  and [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/holydays/kathina.shtml Kathina] at [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt; The season during which a monastery may hold Kathina is one month long, beginning after the full moon of the eleventh month in the [[Lunar calendar]] (usually October).

It is a time of giving, for the laity to express gratitude to [[bhikkhu]]s (Buddhist monks).&lt;ref name="kathina"&gt;[http://www.viet.net/~anson/ebud/ebdha086.htm Vassa (Rains Retreat) and Kathina (Robe Offering) Ceremony]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tv"&gt;[http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=6,9375,0,0,1,0 Vassa, The Rains Retreat]&lt;/ref&gt; Lay Buddhists bring donations to temples, especially new robes for the monks. In Sri Lanka offers Atapirikara අටපිරිකර (Eightfold Requisites).&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kathina"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tv"/&gt;

==Origins==
Kathina is a [[Pali]] word referring to the wooden frame used to measure the length and width by which the robes of Buddhist monks are cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.identity.opm.go.th/identity/doc/nis00847.PDF|title=The Royal Kathin Ceremony|work=Thailand: Traits and Treasures|publisher=National Identity Office|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the legend goes, thirty [[bhikkhu]]s were journeying with the intention of spending Vassa with [[Gautama Buddha]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; However, the rains began before they reached their destination and they had to stop at Saketa.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mind"&gt;[http://www.buddhamind.info/leftside/lifesty-2/kathina.htm Buddhist Festivals: Kathina]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Buddha's guidelines for Vassa, mendicant monks shouldn't travel during the rainy season as they may unintentionally harm crops and/or insects during their journey.&lt;ref name="access"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/khantipalo/wheel206.html#rains Lay Buddhist Practice - The Shrine Room, Uposatha Day, Rains Residence]&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the monks had to stop.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mind"/&gt;

The bhikkhus passed their time together without conflict and practicing Dhamma so afterwards, the Buddha rewarded the monks by demonstrating a way to practice sharing and generosity. A lay disciple had previously donated pieces of cloth to the Buddha, so the Buddha now gave the pieces to the group of monks and told them to make it into a robe and then offer it as a gift to one of them. A frame, called a Kathina, was used to hold the pieces while they were being made into one robe.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mind"/&gt;

==Practices==

===Burma===
'''Kathein''' ({{lang-my|ကထိန်}}, from Pali {{lang|my|ကထိန}}) refers to the ceremony during which yellow robes called ''matho thingan'' ({{lang|my|မသိုးသင်္ကန်း}}) are offered to the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] between the first waning day of [[Thadingyut]] ({{lang|my|သီတင်းကျွတ်}}, approximately October) and the full moon day of [[Tazaungmon]] ({{lang|my|တန်ဆောင်မုန်း}}, approximately November)&lt;ref name="kahtein"&gt;[http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Article/Article2004/Nov/Nov12.htm Kahtein Festival of Tazaungmon]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Burmese calendar]]. During this period, certain rules of the [[Vinaya]] are relaxed for monks.&lt;ref name="kahtein"/&gt; Kahtein trees called ''badaytha bin'' ({{lang|my|ပဒေသာပင်}}), on which offerings like money are hung, are also offered.&lt;ref&gt;http://myanmartravelinformation.com/mti-myanmar-festivals/kathein.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand and Laos===
'''Kathin''' ({{lang-th|กฐิน}}) in [[Thailand]] (there is also the transcription "gathin" in use) is the name for the robes of an [[Buddhism in Thailand#Ordination and clergy|ordained monk]].&lt;ref name=ORID&gt;[http://rirs3.royin.go.th/dictionary.asp On-line Royal Institute Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303000030/http://rirs3.royin.go.th/dictionary.asp |date=2009-03-03 }} (ORID - 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ceremony of ''kathina'' is called ''Thod Kathin'' ({{lang-th|ทอดกฐิน}}). The [[Thai lunar calendar]] reckons the day after the 11th full moon as ''Waning 1, Evening, Moon 11'' ({{lang-th|แรม ๑ ค่ำ เดือน ๑๑|translit=Raem 1 Kham Deuan 11}}). The presentation of ''kathin'' by the [[Rama (Kings of Thailand)|King of Thailand]]'s representative is called ''The Royal Kathin Ceremony'' and often has been an [[Buddhism in Thailand#Government ties|occasion]] for one of Thailand's [[Royal Barge Procession]]s.

The Kathin Festival is a traditional Buddhist festival celebrated by villagers in [[Isan]] and [[Laos]]. Colourful parades and offering ceremonies at the end of monks' retreat at local temples. On Ok Phansa day of the full moon, villagers and city dwellers will go to their local temple for prayers and paying respect to the sacred. Ok Phansa is also the beginning of a 30-day period of [[merit-making]] which affords a special opportunity for prayers to Buddha and for the presentation of gifts to the monks for preserving the faith. This 30-day span of merit making and religious gift giving is referred to as Thord Pha Gathin.

Thord Gathin takes its name from the "laying down" of new robes to the monks. The offering of new, saffron robes to the monks is particularly meritorious and important. Other gifts to the monks may include basic utensils, toiletries, writing materials, and food. Gift-giving is an act of appreciation and gratitude to the monks. Individuals or community groups (such as a village) may perform them. Many villagers combine efforts by collecting cash donations for the maintenance of their local temple. Such donations are vividly arranged on a "money tree" which looks rather like a colourful Christmas tree bedecked with banknotes as the "foliage". The money tree is ceremoniously paraded to the temple, led by a team of drummers and musicians, with the villagers carrying their own individual gifts on trays bringing up the rear. In this way at Thord Gathin, the lay-people of Thailand reaffirm their faith and, in a joyous fashion, bring gifts to Buddha and his servants.

'''Leonard Insull''' (1883&amp;ndash;1974) was [[United Kingdom|Britain's]] leading [[ventriloquism|ventriloquial figure]] maker of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alansemok.com/dummies/insull.html|title=insull|work=The Dummy Doctor|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He created many hundreds of items for Lewis Davenport Ltd.

This is a list of notable [[Music venue|venue]]s where [[jazz]] music is played. It includes [[jazz club]]s, [[Nightclub|clubs]], [[dancehalls]] and historic venues such as [[theatre]]s. A [[jazz club]] is a [[Music venue|venue]] where the primary entertainment is the performance of live [[jazz]] music. Jazz clubs are usually a type of [[nightclub]] or [[bar]], which is licensed to sell alcoholic beverages. Jazz clubs were in large rooms in the eras of [[Orchestral jazz]] and [[Big Band Jazz|big band jazz]], when bands were large and often augmented by a [[string section]]. Large rooms were also more common in the Swing era, because at that time, jazz was popular as a [[dance music]], so the dancers needed space to move. With the transition to 1940s-era styles like [[Bebop]] and later styles such as [[soul jazz]], small combos of musicians such as [[Quartets#Jazz|quartets]] and [[Jazz trio|trios]] were mostly used, and the music became more of a music to listen to, rather than a form of dance music. As a result, smaller clubs with small stages became practical.

In the 2000s, jazz clubs may be found in the [[basement]]s of larger [[residential buildings]], in [[storefront]] locations or in the upper floors of retail businesses. They can be rather small compared to other music venues, such as [[rock music]] clubs, reflecting the intimate atmosphere of jazz shows and long-term decline in popular interest in jazz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jazzwax.com/2008/06/what-killed-jaz.html|title=What Killed Jazz? The Plot Thickens|work=JazzWax|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813122521/http://www.jazzwax.com/2008/06/what-killed-jaz.html|archivedate=2009-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being called "[[Club (organization)|clubs]]", these venues are usually not exclusive. Some clubs, however, have a [[cover charge]] if a live band is playing. Some jazz clubs host "[[jam session]]s" after hours or on early evenings of the week. At jam sessions, both professional musicians and advanced amateurs will typically share the stage.

'''Machiavelli''' is an Italian [[card game]] derived from [[Rummy]] and is usually played by 2 up to 5 players, but can be played by even a higher number. Because of its characteristics, is not generally associated with gambling, but is instead a party game.

Its appearance among card games can be traced to the Second World War.

==Dealing==
Play requires two decks of 52 standard playing cards, excluding the jokers.

The dealer, chosen at random, deals 15 cards to each player in clockwise direction. If there are more than five players, the dealer may reduce the number of cards dealt to each person, three cards being the minimum. After dealing the remaining deck is placed in the center of the table.

===Alternative version===
Two decks of cards without jokers are needed. The dealer, chosen at random, deals 6 cards to each player in clockwise direction. After dealing he puts four face up cards in front of where he would put the rest of the cards, in the center of the table. These cards can be placed in hand only if you can form with other cards at least three of same and different numbers. They are helping cards.

==Opening Play==
The player to the left of the dealer goes first. The game continues going clockwise.

==Rules==
There are three main actions that the player can decide to play:

* Play a valid combination of cards on the table.
* Add one or more cards to an existing combination of cards.
* Draw a card from the deck if you don't play any cards.

A valid combination means:

* Three (or four) of the same card, but different suits (example: {{cards|7h|7d|7s}})
* A straight of at least three consecutive cards of the same suit (example: {{cards|3s|4s|5s}})
* Adding one or more cards to a combination on the table (example: adding {{cards | 2s}} to {{cards|3s|4s|5s}}, and/or adding {{cards | 7c}} to {{cards |7h|7d|7s}})

When finished, the current player passes the game to the player on his left, and should not draw a card. A player who fails to place any cards on the table must draw the top card from the deck and end his turn.

==Special features of the game==
The defining feature of Machiavelli is being able to make changes to the combinations of cards already on the table. The current player, if desired, may reorganize the cards in order to make new combos that make it easier to play one or more cards in his hand.
All new combinations must be valid, and players can not remove any cards already on the table.

===Example 1===
&lt;li&gt;
Imagine that there are three triplets on the table: one of Kings (K), one of Queens (Q) and one of Jacks (J) containing only of hearts, diamonds and clubs.
&lt;ol type=1&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{cards | kh|kd|kc}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{cards | qh|qd|qc}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{cards | jh|jd|jc}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

The current player wants to play his {{cards | ac}} on the table. He can change the combinations on the table to form three straights: one of hearts, one of diamonds and one of clubs.
&lt;ol type=1&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{cards | jh|qh|kh}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{cards | jd|qd|kd}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{cards | jc|qc|kc}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Now, the player can add his {{cards | ac}} the straight made of clubs
&lt;ol type=1&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{cards | jh|qh|kh}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{cards | jd|qd|kd}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{cards | jc|qc|kc|ac}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
This play is correct because all the new combinations created are valid.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

===Example 2===
Imagine that the following combos are on the table
&lt;ol type=1&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{cards | 10h|10d|10s}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{cards | jh|jd|js}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{cards | qh|qd|qc}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
The current player wants to play his {{cards | 9s}}. He attempts to modify the groups by creating a straight of Hearts, one of Diamonds and one of Spades.
&lt;ol type=1&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{cards | 10h|jh|qh}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{cards | 10d|jd|qd}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{cards | 9s|10s|js}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{cards | qc}}
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
Of course, this play is not valid as it leaves a {{cards | qc}} that can not be combined with any other combination on the table. He must restore the combinations to the way they were.

The player, however, can use the last card to create a new combination with the cards in his hand. If he has a {{cards | qd}} and {{cards | qs}} in his hand, he may play both Queens to create a new triple. The end result would be:
&lt;ol type=1&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{cards | 10h|jh|qh}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{cards | 10d|jd|qd}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{cards | 9s|10s|js}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{cards | qc|qd|qs}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
This final result is valid.
&lt;/li&gt;

==How to Win==
The player who manages to play all the cards in his hand wins the game.

==Restoring Combinations==
If a player rearranges the cards on the table, then realizes his intended play will leave invalid combinations, he must return all cards to the groups they were in before he began his turn. If he is unable to do so, he must draw three cards. The other players will then try to restore the cards to their proper groups. Any invalid cards left on the table will be later incorporated into valid groups by other players.

'''Marlo Morgan''' (born September 29, 1937) is an American author, best known for the bestselling book ''Mutant Message Down Under''.&lt;ref name=harpercollins&gt;[http://www.harpercollins.com/authors/6895/Marlo_Morgan/index.aspx Harper Collins] author bio&lt;/ref&gt; She has also written ''Message from Forever'' (1998), another novel based on Australian [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] themes.

==''Mutant Message Down Under''==
Marlo Morgan self-published a book in 1990 titled ''Mutant Message Down Under'', which purported to chronicle the journey of a middle-aged, white, American woman with a group of 62 desert Aborigines, the "Real People", across the continent of Australia. The author states the book was written after the fact inspired by actual experience.

''Mutant Message Down Under'' quickly attained word of mouth popularity with the New Age movement in the United States, was picked up for bookstore distribution by [[Bookpeople (distributor)|Bookpeople]], then consequently picked up by giant publishing firm [[HarperCollins]], and marketed as fiction by them. Nearly a million copies of the HarperCollins publication have been sold around the world. Morgan completed many lecture tours promoting the book in the United States and Europe. In her lectures Ms Morgan speaks of her actual experience with the "Real People" and states she is an Aborigine.

According to the 90-page report published by the [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]-based ''Dumbartung Aboriginal Corporation'', a survey of Aboriginal groups in Central and Western Australia failed to uncover any indication whatsoever of Ms Morgan’s presence in the area or of the existence of the "Real People" tribe. They claim that Aboriginal groups believe Ms Morgan’s desert journey to be fabricated and that her book and teaching lack credibility. The ''Dumbartung Aboriginal Corporation'' stated that it was deeply offensive to Aboriginal people for a white person to be misrepresenting Aboriginal culture for self-promotion and profit. Aboriginal people expressed anger that Ms Morgan’s false message is being accepted as fact by a naive American and European market and were extremely concerned about the resulting long-term implications for their culture.

In 1996 a group of Aboriginal elders, seriously disturbed by the book's implications, received a grant to travel to the States and confront Marlo Morgan about her book and to try to prevent a Hollywoodisation of it. She admitted publicly that she had faked it but this received little publicity in the USA. The Aboriginal people are angry that this book continues to be promoted and sold widely because it gives a false picture of their traditional culture and of their current political and social status. This is regarded as damaging to their struggle for survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dumbartung.org.au/report1.html |title=Dumbartung Report |accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marlomorgan.wordpress.com/helping-yourself-fabrication-of-aboriginal-culture |title=Helping yourself: Marlo Morgan and the fabrication of indigenous wisdom.: An article from: Australian Literary Studies |author=Cath Ellis |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7177">The  term '''multilingual titling''' defines, in the field of [[titling]] for the performing arts (musical theatre, drama, audiovisual productions), the chance for the audience to follow more than one linguistic option.

==History==
In the audiovisual field, multilingual titling was made possible by the introduction of [[DVD]] (1996) &lt;ref name="DVD first appearance (1996)"&gt;DVD was first launched on the market by [[Warner Home Video]] both in the USA (1996) and in Europe (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; in which an integrated data-base gives access to several language channels dedicated to titling.&lt;br /&gt;
In the live performing arts, multilingual options (with possibility of individual choice) were introduced in 1998 at [[Santa Fe Opera]] by mean of custom individual displays set mainly on the back of the seats, as in airplanes.&lt;ref name=" set mainly on the back of the seats, as in the airplanes "&gt;This device, lately adopted by other international theatres, has been realized by [[Figaro Systems]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The introduction, at the end of the 1900s, of Web 2.0 and of the new mobile device technologies caused deep changes also in this field. &lt;br /&gt;
In Europe, in 2011, a significant innovation was provided by the [[Maggio Musicale Fiorentino]] Theatre in Florence, which started the testing of a new multilingual transmission system for mobile consumer devices,&lt;ref name="testing of a new multilingual transmission system for mobile consumer devices "&gt;OperaVoice devised the software.&lt;/ref&gt; that can be integrated to monolingual [[surtitles]].&lt;br /&gt;
In the same year, another multilingual software for mobile consumer devices was developed, as an alternative to the use of [[subtitles]] in cinemas and, the following year (2012), a new head-mounted display system (multimedia glasses) was introduced, serving the same function.&lt;ref name="starts off a new head mounted display system (multimedia glasses) which serves the same function"&gt;Both products (app and glasses) are by MovieReading.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 2011-2012, the Royal Opera House Muscat carried out the most advanced multilingual custom display system to date, interactive and integrated to surtitles screened on a central LED panel.&lt;ref name="multilingual custom display system nowadays, interactive and integrated to surtitles screened on a central LED panel"&gt;A [[Radio Marconi]] project.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other solutions==
The simultaneous presentation of two languages is quite unusual within the more traditional surtitling system, which is used in most cases with monolingual function.

[[File:Klaviatur-3-en.svg|thumb|right|Layout of a [[musical keyboard]] (three [[octave]]s shown).]]

In [[music]], '''gesture''' is any movement, either physical (bodily) or mental (imaginary). As such "gesture" includes both categories of movements required to produce sound and categories of perceptual moves associated with those gestures. The concept of musical gestures has received much attention in various musicological disciplines (e.g. [[musical analysis|music analysis]], [[music therapy]],  [[music psychology]], [[NIME]]) in recent years.

For example, the "musical" movement from a [[voicing (music)|close-position]] [[tonic (music)|tonic]] C [[major chord]] to a close-position [[dominant (music)|dominant]] G major chord requires on the [[piano]] the physical movement from each white key of the first chord to the right (in space, upwards in pitch) four white [[key (instrument)|keys]] or [[steps and skips|steps]]. Thus gesture includes both characteristic physical movements by performers and characteristic [[melody|melodies]], [[phrase (music)|phrases]], [[chord progression]]s, and [[arpeggio|arpeggiations]] produced by (or producing) those movements.

==Introduction==
The concept of musical gestures encompasses a large territory stretching from details of sound-production to more global emotive and aesthetic images of music, and also include considerations of cultural-stylistic vs. more universal modes of expression. In all cases, it is believed that musical gestures manifest the primordial role of human movement in music. For this reason, scholars speak of [[embodied music cognition]] in the sense that listeners relate musical sound to mental images of gestures, i.e. that listening (or even merely imagining music) also is a process of incessant mental re-enactment of musical gestures.

Acknowledging the [[wikt:Special:Search/multimodal|multimodal]] nature of music perception, embodied music cognition could represent a change of [[paradigm]] in music theory and other music related research, research which has often tended to exclude considerations of bodily movement from its conceptual apparatus in favour of focus on more abstract, notation-based elements of music. Focusing on musical gestures provides a coherent and unifying perspective for a renewal of music theory and other music research.

==Music-related body movement==
A subset of musical gestures is what could be called music-related body movement, which can be seen from either the performer's or the perceiver's point of view:
* Performer - movements that are part of a music performance or a performance with music:
** Sound-producing: musician or actor creating musical sound.
** Sound-accompanying: dance or other types of movements that are linked to music.
* Perceiver - movements that are an integral part of music listening:
** Directly connected: dance, air performance
** Loosely connected: running, training.
** Grooving: tapping a foot, nodding the head, etc.

== Formal definition ==

The first mathematical definition of gesture is given in the paper  "Formulas, Diagrams, and Gestures in Music" (Journal of Mathematics and Music, Vol 1, Nr. 1 2007) by [[Guerino Mazzola]] (University of Minnesota) and Moreno Andreatta (IRCAM in Paris). A gesture is a configuration of curves in space and time. More formally, a gesture is a digraph morphism from a "skeleton" of addressed points to a "body", a spatial digraph of a topological category (in the musical case: time, position and pitch). Since the set of gestures of given skeleton and topological category defines a topological category, one may define gestures of gestures, so-called hypergestures.

==Gesture in Indian vocal music==
{{see|Music of India}}
Indian vocalists move their hands while improvising melody.  Although every vocalist has an idiosyncratic gestural style, the motion of the hand and voice are connected through various logics, and many students gesturally resemble their teachers.  Nikki Moran, at the University of London, has done research on this topic, and it is one of the subjects of [[Martin Clayton (ethnomusicologist)|Martin Clayton]] and Laura Leante's Musical Experience Project at the Open University.

Clayton has published a paper on gestural interaction in Indian music performance: "Time, Gesture and Attention in a Khyal Performance." ''Asian Music'', 38 (2), 71–96.

Matt Rahaim, a vocalist and ethnomusicologist, has published a book on the relationship between vocalization and gesture in Indian vocal music: ''Musicking Bodies: Gesture and Voice in Hindustani Music''.  Rahaim's work approaches gesture and vocalization as parallel expressions of melody, investigates isomorphisms between gesture space and raga space, and studies the transmission and inheritance of "paramparic bodies"--vocal/postural/gestural dispositions handed down through teaching lineages.

==Hatten's Musical Gestures==
Robert Hatten (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Hatten, Robert (2004). ''Interpreting Musical Gestures, Topics, and Tropes: Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert'', {{page needed|date=December 2010}}. {{ISBN|0-253-34459-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has been using the concept of musical gestures to denote inner-musical qualities:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Musical gesture is biologically and culturally grounded in communicative human movement. Gesture draws upon the close interaction (and intermodality) of a range of human perceptual and motor systems to synthesize the energetic shaping of motion through time into significant events with unique expressive force. The biological and cultural motivations of musical gesture are further negotiated within the conventions of a musical style, whose elements include both the discrete (pitch, rhythm, meter) and the analog (dynamics, articulation, temporal pacing). Musical gestures are emergent gestalts that convey affective motion, emotion, and agency by fusing otherwise separate elements into continuities of shape and force."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Bandt, Duffy, and MacKinnon (2007). ''Hearing Places'', p.355. {{ISBN|1-84718-255-0}}.

A sequel to ''[[My Girl (film)|My Girl]]'' (1991), its plot follows a now-teenaged Vada Sultenfuss, who travels from her home in suburban [[Pennsylvania]] to [[Los Angeles]] to find more information about her deceased mother.

A book based on the script was written by Patricia Hermes in 1994.

==Plot==
In the spring of 1974, nearly two years following the events of the first film, Vada Sultenfuss sets out on a quest to learn more about her deceased biological mother. She has matured from the spunky, eleven-year-old hypochondriac to a lively, yet more serious teenager seeking independence. Her father Harry and his new wife Shelly DeVoto, whom he dated in the first film, are expecting a baby. They still live in the Sultenfuss funeral home in [[Madison, Pennsylvania]], while Harry's brother Phil has moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he works as a mechanic. Gramoo, Vada's grandmother, is no longer alive. Vada still has her mood ring from two years earlier and wears it in memory of her late best friend Thomas J., who died retrieving it for her after she had lost it. 

To accommodate the new baby, Vada moves out of her bedroom and into Gramoo's old room, and it brings further problems with adjustment. Vada even thinks about getting her own apartment while spending a night out with her father. Vada is given a school assignment to write an essay on someone she admires but has never met. She decides to write about her mother but has few sources to go on, which are all confined to a small box. Among its contents are programs of plays her mother was in, a passport, and a mystery paper bag with a date scribbled on it. Vada expresses her desire to travel someday, so  Shelly concocts a plan for her to travel to [[Los Angeles]] during her spring break, where she can stay with her uncle Phil and do research on her mother, who was from there. Harry initially does not go along with the idea, believing Vada is too young to be traveling by herself, but ultimately allows her take the five-day trip.

Upon arriving in L.A., Vada finds herself confronting a boy her age named Nick, who comes to pick her up at the airport. Nick is the son of Phil's girlfriend Rose, the owner of the car repair shop where Phil works. As a favor to Phil, though annoyed at first about sacrificing his own spring break, Nick helps Vada with the difficult search of learning more about her mother. Their investigation is stalled when Vada learns that her mother's old high school burned down, but she and Nick still manage to track down a yearbook from a year her mother attended. 

Vada and Nick meet several people who knew her mother. Some of the things she finds out do not sit well with her, such as her mother being suspended from school for [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]]. Two of these acquaintances have a look at the paper bag from Vada's small box of memories about her mother, but neither can decipher it. When another blurts out the name Jeffrey Pommeroy, thinking that he is Vada's father, Vada is crushed and wonders why her father never mentioned this person. Eventually, though with some hesitation, she goes to see Jeffrey, her mother's first husband. He provides Vada with valuable information to help with her essay, including home movies and the answer behind the date written on the paper bag. Seeing the home movies touches Vada, as she watches her mother act, as well as sing a song called "[[Smile (Charlie Chaplin song)|Smile]]".

Meanwhile, Phil has trouble proving his love to Rose after a man frequently shows up at the repair shop and continuously flatters her. When Phil finally gets the courage to show Rose what she means to him, he [[marriage proposal|proposes]]. As Vada is ready to head home, she and Nick share a goodbye kiss at the airport before she boards the plane. In her backpack, she finds earrings Nick placed there for her newly pierced ears. When Vada returns home, she realizes Shelly just had a baby boy and heads to the hospital to see her new brother. To calm his crying, Vada sings "Smile" while holding him. Vada's essay on her mother receives an A+, and she hopes to share what she learned during her trip with her brother someday.

===Critical response===
Peter Rainer of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was critical of the film, writing that its "dubious scenario is made even more so by the treacly approach of director Howard Zieff and screenwriter Janet Kovalcik. Everything in this film is sugared with sermons about the importance of Being Yourself. Vada doesn't experience any twinges of rage at the loss of her mother or any misgivings about her quest. She's preternaturally mature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Los Angeles Times|author=Rainer, Peter|date=February 11, 1994|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-11/entertainment/ca-21522_1_vada-sultenfuss|title=MOVIE REVIEW : Sugar Is What 'My Girl 2' Is Made Of|accessdate=September 5, 2018}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Holden of ''[[The New York Times]]'', however, commended it as "appealingly sentimental," adding: "Where the first movie forced Vada to face some jarring realities (a best friend's death, a grandmother's senility) and was heavily salted with mortuary humor, the atmosphere of the sequel is softer and more golden. Among other things, the film is a nostalgic valentine to Los Angeles in palmier days when the city still wore the mystique of a laid-back, post-hippie lotus land."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Review/Film; A Mystery of Adolescence, Circa 1974 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]]|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9806EED61238F932A25751C0A962958260 |accessdate= July 9, 2018|author=Holden, Stephen|date=February 11, 1994}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film two out of four stars, noting that it "seems inspired mostly by the opportunity to recycle the title of a successful film. Scrutinizing the popularity of the first film, perhaps the producers thought it depended on gentle sentimentality, in which a likable young girl deals with the loss of loved ones. As an idea for a series, this is fairly dangerous...&amp;nbsp; I think it's time to give Vada a break, before she becomes a necrophile, and starts spending all of her time upstairs like [[Emily Dickinson]], writing bleak little poems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= My Girl 2|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19940211/REVIEWS/402110304/1023|accessdate=August 30, 2018|date=February 11, 1994|author=Ebert, Roger|author-link=Roger Ebert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Leydon of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' deemed the film a "pleasant, painless and, as sequels go, genuinely ambitious," but conceded that it "may not be enough...&amp;nbsp; to broaden its appeal beyond its obvious target audience of preteen and young adolescent girls (and, of course, tag-along parents and boyfriends)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=My Girl 2|author=Leydon, Joe|date=February 10, 1994|accessdate=September 6, 2018|url=https://variety.com/1994/film/reviews/my-girl-2-1200435908/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
For her performance, Chlumsky won a [[Young Artist Award]] for "Best Performance by a Young Actress Starring in a Motion Picture"; Thomson and O'Brien were also nominated for Young Artist Awards for their roles.

==Cancelled sequel==
For several years ''Still My Girl'' was proposed as the third motion picture in the ''[[My Girl (film)|My Girl]]'' movie franchise and it was in development at Columbia Pictures. In his 2003 United Kingdom talk show interview with host [[Michael Parkinson]], [[Dan Aykroyd]] stated that Columbia had an interest in getting this off the ground and strong interest in [[Anna Chlumsky]] returning to her role as Vada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Headlines: Still My Girl |url= http://www.darkhorizons.com/news03/030306.php |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120630091633/http://www.darkhorizons.com/news03/030306.php |dead-url= yes |archive-date= June 30, 2012 |date= March 6, 2003 |work= [[Dark Horizons]] |accessdate= 6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, both Chlumsky and Aykroyd were still attached to the project but as the time passed it was becoming less and less likely that it would ever go into production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Morgan |first= K.C. |date= July 27, 2009 |title= My Girl Star: All Grown Up |work= FilmCrunch |url= http://movies.gearlive.com/movies/article/q107-my-girl-star-all-grown-up/ |accessdate= August 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two national and 10 state/territory daily newspapers, 35 regional dailies and 470 other regional and suburban '''newspapers in Australia'''. The two national daily newspapers are ''[[The Australian]]'' and ''[[The Australian Financial Review]]''. Other notable newspapers are ''[[The Canberra Times]]'', ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Age]]'', and ''[[Herald Sun|The Herald Sun]]'' (Melbourne). All major metropolitan newspapers are owned either by [[News Limited]], a subsidiary of [[News Corporation]], or [[Fairfax Media]], except ''[[The West Australian]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|The Sunday Times]]''.

==History==
Australia's earliest newspaper, the ''[[Sydney Gazette|Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser]]'', was first printed in 1803. In 1810 the second newspaper in Australia, the ''Derwent Star and Van Diemen's Land Intelligencer'' was founded in Van Diemen's Land, but ceased the same year.&lt;ref name="AussieData"&gt;{{cite book

By the mid-1850s, there were 11 papers in [[Tasmania]]. The ''Tasmanian and Port Dalrymple Advertiser'' founded in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] in 1825 was the first provincial newspaper in Australia.&lt;ref name="isaacs"&gt;{{cite book

Australia's longest-running newspaper, the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', was first published as the ''Sydney Herald'' in 1831. The ''Herald''{{'}}s rival, ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'', was first published in July 1879. Weekly newspapers were an important feature of the Australian newspaper scene in the nineteenth century.

Australia's first foreign-language newspaper, ''Die Deutsche Post für die australischen Kolonien'' was published in Adelaide from 1848-1850.&lt;ref name="AussieData" /&gt;

Australia's first national daily newspaper, ''Daily Commercial News'' (now ''[[Lloyd's List Australia]]'') was first published in April 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = National Library of Australia|work=Trove | url =

During the 1980s and 1990s [[colour printing]] and [[Phototypesetting|cold offset printing]] took place in the production of newspapers. Many newspapers became available in electronic form either on CD-ROM or via the World Wide Web.&lt;ref name="isaacs" /&gt;

The '''one-shot deviation principle''' (also known as '''one-deviation property'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategy: An Introduction to Game Theory|last=Watson|first=Joel|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2013|isbn=978-0393123876|location=New York|pages=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the principle of optimality of [[dynamic programming]] applied to [[game theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blackwell|first=David|date=1965|title=Discounting Dynamic Programming|url=|journal=Annals of Mathematical Statistics|volume=36|pages=226–235|via=|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177700285}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It says that a strategy profile of a finite [[extensive-form game]] is a [[subgame perfect equilibrium]] (SPE) if and only if there exist no profitable one-shot deviations for each subgame and every player.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tirole|first1=Jean|last2=Fudenberg|first2=Drew|title=Game theory|year=1991|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-262-06141-4|edition=6. printing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In simpler terms, if no player can increase their payoffs by deviating a single decision, or period, from their original strategy, then the strategy that they have chosen is a SPE. As a result, no player can profit from deviating from the strategy for one period and then reverting to the strategy. 

Furthermore, the one-shot deviation principle is very important for infinite horizon games, in which the principle typically does not hold&lt;ref&gt;Obara, I. (2012). Subgame Perfect Equilibrium [PDF document]. Slide 13. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.econ.ucla.edu/iobara/SPE201B.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, since it is not plausible to consider an infinite number of strategies and payoffs in order to solve. In an infinite horizon game where the [[discount factor]] is less than 1, a strategy profile is a subgame perfect equilibrium if and only if it satisfies the one-shot deviation principle&lt;ref&gt;Ozdaglar, A. (2010). Repeated Games [PDF document]. Slide 13. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-254-game-theory-with-engineering-applications-spring-2010/lecture-notes/MIT6_254S10_lec15.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Definitions ==

The following is the paraphrased definition from Watson (2013)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To check whether strategy ''s'' is a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, we have to ask every player ''i'' and every subgame, if considering ''s'', there is a strategy ''s’'' that yields a strictly higher payoff for player ''i'' than does ''s'' in the subgame. This analysis is equivalent to looking at single deviations from ''s'', meaning ''s’'' differs from s at only one information set. Note that the choices associated with ''s'' and ''s’'' are the same at all nodes that are successors of nodes in the information set where s and ''s’'' prescribe different actions. 

=== Example ===
Consider a [[symmetric game]] with two players in which each player makes binary choice decisions, A or B, in three sequences. There are 8 (2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) total number of pure strategies for each player: {AAA, AAB, ABA, ABB, BBB, BBA, BAB, BAA}. In this example, consider that a player chooses strategy (AAA). To check whether this strategy is a SPE, the one-shot deviation principle states that the player needs to check the payoffs of only three other strategies which differ from the original strategy by a single deviation, instead of all seven others. These three strategies are: ('''B'''AA), (A'''B'''A), and (AA'''B'''). If none of these three strategies yields a higher payoff than (AAA), then the player can conclude that (AAA) is a SPE.

[[File:Student from UNY reading short story by Evi Idawati 2015-06-08 06.jpg|thumb|A student of [[Yogyakarta State University]] performing a dramatic reading of a short story]]
'''Oral Interpretation''' is a dramatic art, also commonly called "interpretive reading" and "dramatic reading", though these terms are more conservative and restrictive.  In certain applications, oral interpretation is also a theatre art – as in reader's theatre, in which a work of literature is performed with manuscripts in hand or, more traditionally, using stools and music stands; and especially chamber theatre, which dispenses with manuscripts and uses what may be described as essentialist costuming and stage lighting, and suggestive scenery.

The term is succinctly defined by [[Paul Campbel]]l (''The Speaking and Speakers of Literature''; Dickinson, 1967) as the "oralization of literature"; or more eloquently, if less intelligibly, by Charlotte Lee and Timothy Gura (''Oral Interpretation''; Houghton-Mifflin, 1997) as "the art of communicating to an audience a work of literary art in its intellectual, emotional, and aesthetic entirety".  Historically essential to Charlotte Lee's definition of oral interpretation is the fact the performer is "reading from a manuscript".  This perspective, once the majority view, has long since become the minority opinion on the question; so that whether one is or is not reading from a manuscript, the art retains the same name.

Voice and movement technique is ''opsis'' ("spectacle") while oral interpretation is, conceptually, ''melopoiia'' ("music technique").

Because oral interpretation is an essential dramatic element in all performance art (even dance, in which the oral element is most typically a silent element), all actors, singers, storytellers, etc., are ''interpreters'' – but not all interpreters are necessarily actors, or singers, or storytellers, and so on.  When, for example, the writer [[David Sedaris]] reads one of his stories on stage, or when [[Leonard Cohen]] performs one of his lyric poems, they are both engaged in the art of oral interpretation.  But Sedaris is no actor, and even Cohen himself would say that ''he'' is no singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cohencentric.com/2015/06/22/rarely-viewed-video-leonard-cohen-on-his-atrocious-voice-dylan-lead-belly-ice-t-songwriting-love-wheres-the-beef/|title=1992 Video: Leonard Cohen On His Atrocious Voice, Dylan, Ice-T, Songwriting, Love &amp; Where's The Beef|date=22 June 2015|work=cohencentric.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, there is a historic and purely academic argument as to whether oral interpretation and drama/theatre performance are different names for the same thing or whether they are completely different art forms.  This argument is almost exclusively found at colleges and universities whose theatre programs evolved in departments historically or currently called "English and Speech", "Speech and Dramatic Arts" or "Communication and Theatre Arts".  The argument is rarely heard in theatre programs that did not evolve out of English and/or Speech Communication departments, such as those associated with schools/colleges of music.

In high schools across the United States, Oral Interpretation is a very highly valued competition event, particularly in the mid-western states, such as Nebraska, Iowa, and South Dakota.  Students select a work of literature, make a cutting of the literature to fit a time limit of 10 minutes, and perform it in several rounds at tournaments across their state. The piece must be from a published, worthwhile piece of literature, with the exception of Readers Theatre. The categories of said event are as follows:
* Serious Prose—Interpretation of a work of prose literature with a serious basis. Single-person event.
* Humorous Interp—Interpretation of any published work of comedic literature. Single-person event
* Dramatic Interp—Interpretation of a dramatic play with a serious nature. Single-person event.
* Poetry—Interpretation of a published work of poetry. Single-person event.
* Non-Original Oratory—Interpretation of an oratorical speech that has been previously delivered. Single-person event.
* Duo Interpretation—Interpretation of a piece of literature where two Interpers are involved. The pair may not look at nor touch each other, and must deliver the piece in the direction of the audience. This category has the most stringent rules.
* Readers Theatre—A theatrical interpretation performance where 3-6 people participate. They may perform an original piece, or they may take a cutting from a work of literature. This category has the least amount of rules.

'''''Paramour''''' was [[Cirque du Soleil]]'s first resident [[musical theatre]] show at the [[Lyric Theatre (1998 New York City)|Lyric Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], [[New York City]]. ''Paramour'' was themed to the "Golden age of [[Hollywood]]" and followed the life of "a poet who is forced to choose between love and art". It had similar elements to Cirque du Soleil's retired [[Los Angeles]] resident show in ''[[Iris (Cirque du Soleil)|Iris]]'' (which was also themed on cinema) written and created by [[Philippe Decouflé]], and had a 38-person onstage cast with actress [[Ruby Lewis]] in the lead as Indigo.&lt;ref name=NYT2/&gt; ''Paramour'' began preview shows on April 16, 2016, with an official premiere on May 25, 2016.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; It closed exactly one year after its first preview show, on 16 April 2017.

During previews, ''Paramour'' got off to a strong start and grossed over $1 million in its first six shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The New York Times|title=Cirque du Soleil’s ‘Paramour’ Has Strong Start in Broadway Grosses|first=Michael|last=Paulson|date=April 25, 2016|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/theater/cirque-du-soleils-paramour-has-strong-start-in-broadway-grosses.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was directed by French director-choreographer [[Philippe Decouflé]], who was also the director of the [[film|cinema]] themed Cirque du Soleil show ''[[Iris (Cirque du Soleil)|Iris]]''.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The rest of the creative team was also the same as for ''Iris'' apart from the assistant directors, composer and sound designer. Scenes from ''Iris'', such as [[aerial straps]] performed by the Atherton twins (who also performed in ''Iris''), were incorporated into ''Paramour''.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/theater/cirque-du-soleils-broadwaybalancingact.html?_r=0|title=After Two New York Flops, Cirque du Soleil Bets Big on Broadway|first=Michael|last=Paulson|date=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The show closed on Broadway on 16 April 2017 after 31 previews and 366 performances. Despite average box office sales, Cirque was allegedly paid $23 million to terminate its contract early&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/theatre/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-smashing-records-even-before-opening-20180415-h0yscc.html|title=Harry Potter and the Cursed Child smashing records even before opening|date=April 15, 2018|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in order to vacate the Lyric and allow for the necessary renovations for the show's successor, ''[[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]'' which had a sold out track record since opening on the [[West End theatre|West End]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/legit/news/paramour-moving-cirque-du-soleil-broadway-1201931474/|title=Cirque du Soleil’s ‘Paramour’ to Move Out When Theater Closes for Renovations|first=Gordon|last=Cox|date=December 1, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/paramour-ends-broadway-run-april-16|title=Paramour Ends Broadway Run April 16 - Playbill|website=Playbill}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Paramour'' is scheduled to reopen in April 2019 in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=German|url=https://www.stage-entertainment.de/musicals-shows/cirque-du-soleil-paramour-hamburg.html?etcc_med=Display&amp;etcc_cmp=CDS%5FCrosspromo&amp;etcc_var=PAR%5FHH&amp;etcc_grp=Hamburg&amp;etcc_tar=Branding%5FVollpreis&amp;etcc_ctv=Startseite|title=Paramour|website=Stage-entertainment.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[Charles Isherwood]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote "The athletic circus acts that are laced throughout the show provide the real entertainment, and make the surrounding book scenes and songs feel even more bogus and synthetic," and "There’s no denying the breathtaking magic of seeing bodies swim through the air with such apparent [[weightlessness]]. Too bad the musical surrounding them feels just as weightless, and far more forgettable."&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Charles Isherwood|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/theater/review-paramour-brings-cirque-du-soleil-to-broadway.html|title=Review: ‘Paramour’ Brings Cirque du Soleil to Broadway|author=Isherwood, Charles|date=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maren Wade of ''[[Las Vegas Weekly]]'' wrote "I think what made Paramour truly special was the unique element of the acrobatics in a more real-life setting. It felt like one minute I was watching a big [[Broadway theatre|Broadway show]], but all of a sudden these crazy acrobatics would happen in scenes and scenarios where they were least expected," adding "I loved the show and would highly recommend it to anyone who is a Broadway and Cirque fan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Las Vegas Weekly]]|date=May 28, 2016|url=http://lasvegasweekly.com/ae/2016/may/28/confessions-showgirl-paramour-cirque-review-broadw/|title=Confessions of a Showgirl: A showgirl’s review of Cirque’s ‘Paramour’ on Broadway|author=Wade, Maren}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rex Reed]] of ''[[New York Observer]]'' said "If your demands are not high and you don’t try to make too much sense of the wobbly so-called “plot,” there’s a lot of skill on view here that is fun to watch. Paramour is a dream conceived by [[P. T. Barnum]] and revised by [[Bob Fosse]], and some of it works even better on a Broadway stage than in a tent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[New York Observer]]|title=Cirque du Soleil Brings Its Acrobatic Extravaganza to Broadway|authorlink=Rex Reed|author=Reed, Rex|date=June 2, 2016|url=http://observer.com/2016/06/cirque-du-soleil-brings-its-acrobatic-extravaganza-to-broadway/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5986">'''''Poetry film''''' is a subgenre of [[film]] that fuses the use of spoken word poetry, visual images, and sound to create a stronger presentation and interpretation of the meaning being conveyed. This fusion of image and spoken word (both independent and interdependent) creates what William Wees called the "Poetry-film" genre. He suggested that "a number of avant-garde film and video makers have created a synthesis of poetry and film that generates associations, connotations and metaphors neither the verbal nor the visual text would produce on its own".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studycollection.co.uk/poetry.html|title=Poetry-Film &amp; The Film Poem: Some Clarifications|author=|date=|website=www.studycollection.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This genre of film was first explored in the 1920s by French Impressionists Germaine Dulac, Louis Delluc,  Man Ray, Hans Richter, and others. In the mid-1960s and early 1970s this genre was further explored by the [[Beat Generation]] poets [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], and Herman Berlandt, and developed into a festival held annually at the [[Fort Mason]] Center in [[San Francisco, California]].

Poetry film is characterized by its [[nonlinear narrative]] style of editing, and [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] flow of images and spoken words, although linear narration and editing have been used to good effect in the creation of some poetry films (see [[Narrative]]). Generally, poetry film is created as a noncommercial production, but some attempts have been made to produce commercial films. Some poetry films have been used as instructional aids in literature classes to illustrate concepts such as allusion, simile, and metaphor.

In 1981, a group in Nashville, Tennessee, experimented with fusing spoken word, images, and sound into what was called "poetry videos". The concept was to create poetry videos, similar to music videos which were gaining popularity at the time, making poetry more acceptable as a commercial product. One video was produced with the assistance of the Tennessee State University communications department but was never commercially released.

One of the most famous poetry films ever produced was aired on the ''[[Smothers Brothers]] Show'' in 1968. The film was by [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] and was titled the "Assassination Raga". The film fused images of death, slow sitar music, and Ferlinghetti's spoken word poem about the assassination of the Kennedys.

More recently George Aguilar has developed a TV series of poetry films called Eyestruck. Performance Poet [[Hedwig Gorski]] was one of the first to successfully produce and direct her video poem using state arts funding.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Division of the Arts &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYhTEMnSroI&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She received an Artist's Fellowship in 2002 for work fusing poetry and media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/hedwiggorskilitera/|title=hedwiggorskilitera|author=|date=|website=sites.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 21st century the genre of poetry films making also reached other parts of the world including India. Several traditional television professionals experimented with the art. In 2007 a non-profit organisation, Sadho, created an exclusive platform for screening of poetry films in India. The Sadho Poetry Film Festival is a biennial international film festival in New Delhi. The first Sadho Poetry Film Festival was organised in the year 2007.

==Poetry Film Makers==
Vishwajyoti Ghosh, Sidharth Pratap Singh, Parijat Kaul, Anjali Monteiro &amp; K.P Jayasankar ([[Centre for Media and Cultural Studies]]), Nandan Saxena &amp; Kavita Bahl, are some of poetry film makers from India. The list of poet-poetry film makers also includes Sidharth Saxena and Shashwat Mudgal from India and Tahira Rana from the UK.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15270">'''Postmodernist film''' is a classification for works that articulate the themes and ideas of [[postmodernism]] through the medium of [[film|cinema]]. Postmodernist film attempts to subvert the [[mainstream]] [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] of [[narrative structure]] and [[characterization]], and tests the audience's [[suspension of disbelief]].&lt;ref name=Susan1&gt;{{cite journal|title=Generation Pulp|journal=Youth Studies Australia|date=Spring 1995|volume=14|issue=3|pages=14–19|author=Susan Hopkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Laurent1&gt;{{cite journal|title=Is Cinema Renewing Itself?|journal=Film-Philosophy|volume=6|issue=15|date=July 2002|author=Laurent Kretzschmar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Linda2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/criticism/hutchinp.html |title=Irony, Nostalgia, and the Postmodern |author=Linda Hutcheon|date=January 19, 1998|publisher=University of Toronto English Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, such films also break down the cultural divide between high and low [[art]] and often upend typical portrayals of [[gender]], [[race (classification of humans)|race]], [[Social class|class]], [[genre]], and [[time]] with the goal of creating something that does not abide by traditional narrative expression.

==Overview of postmodernism==
[[Postmodernism]] is a complex paradigm of different philosophies and artistic styles. The movement emerged as a reaction to high [[modernism]].&lt;ref name=frederic1&gt;{{citation|url=http://classweb.gmu.edu/sandrew3/misc/nlr142jameson_postmodernism.pdf|title=Postmodernism and Consumer Society|author=Frederic Jameson|publisher=George Mason University|access-date=2012-04-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216030504/http://classweb.gmu.edu/sandrew3/misc/nlr142jameson_postmodernism.pdf|archive-date=2011-12-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Modernism]] is a paradigm of thought and viewing the world characterized in specific ways that postmodernism reacted against. Modernism was interested in master and [[meta]] narratives of [[history]] of a teleological nature.&lt;ref name=martin1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/pomo.html |title=The Postmodern, Postmodernism, Postmodernity: Approached to Po-Mo|author=Martin Irvine|publisher=Georgetown University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of modernism suggested that sociopolitical and cultural progress was inevitable and important for society and art.&lt;ref name=martin1/&gt;&lt;ref name="dragan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://critcrim.org/critpapers/milovanovic_postmod.htm|title=Dueling Paradigms: Modernist v. Postmodern Thought|author=Dragan Milovanovic|publisher=American Society of Criminology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas of cultural unity (i.e. the narrative of the West or something similar) and the hierarchies of values of class that go along with such a conception of the world is another marker of modernism.&lt;ref name=frederic1/&gt; In particular, modernism insisted upon a divide between "low" forms of art and "high" forms of art (creating more value judgments and hierarchies).&lt;ref name=frederic1/&gt;&lt;ref name="dragan"/&gt; This dichotomy is particularly focused on the divide between official culture and [[popular culture]].&lt;ref name=frederic1/&gt; Lastly but, by no means comprehensively, there was a faith in the "real" and the future and knowledge and the competence of expertise that pervades modernism. At heart, it contained a confidence about the world and humankind's place in it.&lt;ref name=frederic1/&gt;

Postmodernism attempts to subvert and resist and differ from the preoccupations of modernism across many fields ([[music]], history, art, cinema, etc.). Postmodernism emerged in a time not defined by war or revolution but rather by [[media (communication)|media]] culture.&lt;ref name=Susan1/&gt;  Unlike modernism, postmodernism does not have faith in [[metanarrative|master narratives]] of history or [[culture]] or even the [[self]] as an autonomous subject.&lt;ref name=Susan1/&gt;&lt;ref name=frederic1/&gt;&lt;ref name="dragan"/&gt; Rather postmodernism is interested in contradiction, fragmentation, and instability.&lt;ref name=Susan1/&gt; Postmodernism is often focused on the destruction of hierarchies and boundaries. The mixing of different times and periods or styles of art that might be viewed as "high" or "low" is a common practice in postmodern work.&lt;ref name=Susan1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Laurent1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Linda2/&gt; This practice is referred to as [[pastiche]].&lt;ref name=Susan1/&gt; Postmodernism takes a deeply subjective view of the world and identity and art, positing that an endless process of signification and signs is where any "meaning" lies.&lt;ref&gt;"Postmodern Allegory and David Lynch's Wild at Heart" ''Critical Art: A South-North Journal of Cultural and Media Studies''; 1995, Vol. 9 Issue 1 by Cyndy Hendershot&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mary1&gt;{{cite book|title=A Postmodern Cinema|publisher=Scarecrow Press |location=Kent, England |year=2002|author=Mary Alemany-Galway}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, postmodernism demonstrates what it perceives as a fractured world, time, and art.

==Specific elements==
Postmodernist film – similar to [[postmodernism]] as a whole – is a reaction to the modernist works of its field, and to their tendencies. Modernist cinema, "explored and exposed the formal concerns of the medium by placing them at the forefront of consciousness. Modernist cinema questions and made visible the meaning-production practices of film."&lt;ref name=woods&gt;''Beginning Postmodernism'', Manchester University Press: 1999 by Tim Woods&lt;/ref&gt; The [[auteur]] theory and idea of an author producing a work from his singular vision guided the concerns of modernist film. "To investigate the transparency of the image is modernist but to undermine its reference to reality is to engage with the aesthetics of postmodernism."&lt;ref name="dragan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Reading the Postmodern Image: A Cognitive Mapping," ''Screen'': 31, 4 (Winter 1990) by Tony Wilson&lt;/ref&gt; The modernist film has more faith in the author, the individual, and the accessibility of reality itself than the postmodernist film.

Postmodernism is in many ways interested in the liminal space that would be typically ignored by more modernist or traditionally narrative offerings. The idea is that the meaning is often generated most productively through the spaces and transitions and collisions between words and moments and images. [[Henri Bergson]] writes in his book ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|Creative Evolution]]'', "The obscurity is cleared up, the contradiction vanishes, as soon as we place ourselves along the transition, in order to distinguish states in it by making cross cuts therein in thoughts. The reason is that there is more in the transition than the series of states, that is to say, the possible cuts--more in the movement than the series of position, that is to say, the possible stops."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Creative_evolution.html?id=_DkZAAAAYAAJ ''Creative Evolution'']&lt;/ref&gt; The thrust of this argument is that the spaces between the words or the cuts in a film create just as much meaning as the words or scenes themselves.

Postmodernist film is often separated from modernist cinema and traditional narrative film by three key characteristics. One of them is an extensive use of [[homage (arts)|homage]] or [[pastiche]],&lt;ref name=woods/&gt; resulting from the fact that postmodern filmmakers are open to blending many disparate genres and tones within the same film. The second element is [[meta-reference]] or self-reflexivity, highlighting the construction and relation of the image to other images in media and not to any kind of external reality.&lt;ref name=woods/&gt; A self-referential film calls the viewer's attention – either through [[meta-reference|characters' knowledge of their own fictional nature]], or through visuals – that the movie itself is only a movie. This is sometimes achieved by emphasizing the unnatural look of an image which seems contrived. Another technique used to achieve meta-reference is the use of intertextuality, in which the film's characters reference or discuss other works of fiction. Additionally, many postmodern films tell stories that [[nonlinear narrative|unfold out of chronological order]], deconstructing or fragmenting time so as to, once again, highlight the fact that what is appearing on screen is constructed. A third common element is a bridging of the gap between [[highbrow]] and [[low culture|lowbrow]] activities and artistic styles&lt;ref name=Laurent1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Linda2/&gt;&lt;ref name=woods/&gt; – e.g., a parody of Michelangelo's [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] in which Adam is reaching for a McDonald's burger rather than the hand of God. This would exemplify the fusion of high and low because Michelangelo is widely regarded as one of the greatest of all painters, whereas fast food is commonly named among the lowbrow elements of modern society.

The use of homage and pastiche can, in and of itself, result in a fusion of high and low. For this reason, homage is sometimes accompanied by characters' value judgments as to the worth and cultural value of the works being parodied, ensuring the viewer understands whether the thing being referenced is considered highbrow or lowbrow.

Lastly, contradictions of all sorts – whether it be in visual technique, characters' morals, or other things – are crucial to postmodernism, and the two are in many cases irreconcilable. Any theory of postmodern film would have to be comfortable with [[paradox]]es or contradictions of ideas and their articulation.&lt;ref name=Laurent1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mary1/&gt;

==Specific postmodern examples==

===''Blade Runner''===
[[Ridley Scott]]'s ''Blade Runner'' might be the best known postmodernist film.&lt;ref name=woods/&gt; Ridley Scott's 1982 film is about a future [[dystopia]] where "replicants" (human [[cyborgs]]) have been invented and are deemed dangerous enough to hunt down when they escape. There is tremendous effacement of boundaries between genres and cultures and styles that are generally more separate along with the fusion of disparate styles and times that is a common trope in postmodernist cinema. "The futuristic set and action mingle with drab 1940s clothes and offices, [[punk rock]] hairstyles, pop Egyptian style and oriental culture. The population is singularly multicultural and the language they speak is agglomeration of English, Japanese, German and Spanish. The film alludes to the [[private investigator|private eye]] genre of [[Raymond Chandler]] and the characteristics of [[film noir]] as well as [[Biblical]] [[motif (narrative)|motif]]s and images."&lt;ref name=Laurent1/&gt;&lt;ref name=woods/&gt; Here is a demonstration of the mixing of cultures and boundaries and styles of art. The film is playing with time (the various types of clothes) and culture and genre by mixing them all together to create the world of the film. The fusion of noir and [[science-fiction]] is another example of the film deconstructing cinema and genre. This is an embodiment of the postmodern tendency to destroy boundaries and genres into a self-reflexive product. "The postmodern aesthetic of Blade Runner is thus the result of recycling, fusion of levels, discontinuous signifiers, explosion of boundaries, and erosion. The disconnected temporality of the replicants and the pastiche of the city are all an effect of a postmodern, postindustrial condition: wearing out, waste."&lt;ref&gt;[http://work.colum.edu/~zfurness/theories/bladerunner.pdf "Ramble City: Postmodernism and Blade Runner" ''October'', 41 (1987) by Giuliana Bruno]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Pulp Fiction''===
[[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' is another example of a postmodernist film.&lt;ref&gt;Tincknell, Estella (2006). "The Soundtrack Movie, Nostalgia and Consumption", in ''Film's Musical Moments'', ed. Ian Conrich and Estella Tincknell (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press). {{ISBN|0-7486-2344-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, Geoff (2002). ''Film Comedy'' (London: Wallflower Press). {{ISBN|1-903364-35-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, James (November 12, 1994). ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The film tells the interweaving stories of gangsters, a boxer, and robbers. The film breaks down chronological time and demonstrates a particular fascination with [[intertextuality]]: bringing in texts from both traditionally "high" and "low" realms of art.&lt;ref name=Susan1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Laurent1/&gt; This foregrounding of media places the self as "a loose, transitory combination of [[media consumption]] choices."&lt;ref name=Susan1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Linda2/&gt; ''Pulp Fiction'' fractures time (by the use of asynchronous time lines) and by using styles of prior decades and combining them together in the movie.&lt;ref name=Susan1/&gt; By focusing on intertextuality and the subjectivity of time, ''Pulp Fiction'' demonstrates the postmodern obsession with signs and subjective perspective as the exclusive location of anything resembling meaning.

'''Sea Odyssey: Giant Spectacular''' was a three-day outdoor [[performance art]] event featuring giant [[marionette]]s, that took place in [[Liverpool]], England, from 20 to 22 April  2012.&lt;ref name=BBC-Day1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-17777090 |title=Giant puppets in Liverpool for Sea Odyssey Titanic event |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=20 April 2012 |accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was designed and operated by French street theatre company [[Royal de Luxe]], and featured three giants, the 9-metre (30-foot) tall Little Giant Girl, the 15-metre (50-foot) tall Giant Uncle, and the girl's dog, Xolo.&lt;ref name=Wake&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2012/04/20/sea-odyssey-little-giant-girl-wakes-up-to-start-three-day-liverpool-spectacular-100252-30801720 |title=Sea Odyssey: Little Giant Girl wakes up to start three-day Liverpool spectacular|publisher=[[Liverpool Daily Post]]|date=20 April 2012|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was estimated that, over the course of the three days, 600,000 people watched the event&lt;ref name=BBC-Day3&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-17798401 |title=Liverpool giants: Sea Odyssey Titanic event ends |publisher=BBC |date=22 April 2012 |accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Liverpool City Council recorded a footfall in the main shopping district of 900,000.&lt;ref name=councilstat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liverpool.gov.uk/news/details.aspx?id=214917|title=City on crest of a wave after Sea Odyssey|publisher=Liverpool City Council|date=25 April 2012|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent report into the impact of Sea Odyssey concluded it was the most successful event in Liverpool’s history. The report showed that 800,000 people took part in the event, which resulted in an economic impact of £32 million.&lt;ref name=councilstat2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liverpool.gov.uk/news/details.aspx?id=215928|title=Sea Odyssey success|publisher=Liverpool City Council|date=25 April 2012|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==

The event, staged to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], was inspired by a letter written by a 10-year-old girl, May McMurray, in 1912 to her father William, a bedroom steward on the Titanic who did not survive the sinking. The letter did not arrive until after the Titanic sailed, and was returned to the sender and is now on display at Liverpool's Maritime Museum.&lt;ref name=Inspired&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-17729987 |title=Liverpool Sea Odyssey event inspired by Titanic letter |publisher=BBC |date=20 April 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=May&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-culture/liverpool-arts/2012/04/19/sea-odyssey-the-story-of-the-little-girl-who-inspired-liverpool-s-biggest-ever-street-theatre-event-99623-30779993/ |title=SEA ODYSSEY: The story of the little girl who inspired Liverpool’s biggest ever street theatre event |publisher=Liverpool Daily Post |date=19 April 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RDL_News&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal-de-luxe.com/en/news/ |title=Liverpool, "L’Odyssée de la mer" (in French)|publisher=Royal de Luxe, Nantes| date= |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of the event, estimated at £1.5m, was partly met by European legacy funding from Liverpool's 2008 Capital of Culture year. Early forecasts suggested it resulted in a £12&amp;nbsp;million boost to the city's economy.&lt;ref name=Heart/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-17812818 |title=Liverpool Sea Odyssey giant event's £12m economy boost |publisher=BBC |date=23 April 2012 |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LCC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://liverpool.gov.uk/news/details.aspx?id=214917 |title=City on crest of a wave after Sea Odyssey |publisher=Liverpool City Council |date=25 April 2012 |accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story, written by Jean-Luc Courcoult, envisages the girl's uncle, a diver, searching the wreck of the Titanic, and having found his brother's letter, coming ashore to bring it and the news of the ship's fate to his niece.&lt;ref name=Story&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.giantspectacular.com/content/story |title=Liverpool Story |publisher=giantspectacular.com |date= |accessdate=23 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512125448/http://www.giantspectacular.com/content/story |archivedate=12 May 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rising from the water at Liverpool's [[Salthouse Dock]], the giant uncle wanders around the city in search of the girl, who simultaneously awakes in the city's [[Stanley Park, Liverpool|Stanley Park]] and, accompanied by her dog Xolo, sets out to look for her uncle.&lt;ref name=Wake/&gt;

The two miss each other several times, finally meeting up at the [[King's Dock, Port of Liverpool|King's Dock]] at the end of the second day of the event. The following day, the pair set out together for a final walk around the city centre, and then board a boat at [[Canning Dock]] and leave Liverpool via the River Mersey.&lt;ref name=BBC-Day3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heart&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-17806029 |title=Sea Odyssey giants capture Liverpool's heart |publisher=BBC |date=22 April 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between them, by the end of the three days, the giants covered a distance of 23 miles (37&amp;nbsp;km), taking in the areas around the football grounds of [[Liverpool F.C.]] and [[Everton F.C.]], the city centre, [[Pier Head]], [[Chinatown, Liverpool|Chinatown]], and the [[Albert Dock]] and King's Dock complexes.&lt;ref name=Inspired/&gt;

==Giants==

The giants taking part in the event comprised the Little Giant Girl, measuring 9 metres (30 feet), the Giant Uncle, measuring 15 metres (50 feet), and the girl's dog, Xolo. The girl and the uncle are constructed from [[Populus|poplar]] wood, [[Tilia|lime]] wood and steel, and have eyes made from street lights and hair made from horse hair. The dog, Xolo, is made from [[papier-mâché]] and steel. All three are controlled using ropes, pulleys and motors.&lt;ref name=BBC-Day1/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC-Bringing/&gt;

During the three days, the puppets, cranes, and other equipment required a team of 110 operators, who call themselves ''[[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliputians]]'' after the characters from the 1726 [[Jonathan Swift]] novel ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''. A total of 20 cranes were required to move them around the city.&lt;ref name=BBC-Day1/&gt; The uncle requires 31 people to control, with the girl operated by a team of 24 puppeteers, and the dog a team of 21.&lt;ref name=BBC-Bringing/&gt;

During the tour the giants were accompanied by a group of live musicians, and used a number of props, including the girl's boat, on which she sailed for part of her journey, her scooter, deck chair, bed, and radio.&lt;ref name=Story/&gt;

[[Image:SarDrama Урод репетиции 01.JPG|thumb|right|A director providing instruction]]

A '''theatre director''' or '''stage director''' is an instructor in the [[theatre]] field who oversees and orchestrates the mounting of a theatre production (a play, an [[opera]], a [[Musical theatre|musical]], or a devised piece of work) by unifying various endeavours and aspects of production. The director's function is to ensure the quality and completeness of theatre production and to lead the members of the creative team into realizing their artistic vision for it. The director therefore collaborates with a team of creative individuals and other staff, coordinating research, [[stagecraft]], [[costume design]], [[Theatrical property|props]], [[lighting designer|lighting design]], acting, [[set design]], [[stage combat]], and [[sound design]] for the production. If the production he or she is mounting is a new piece of writing or a (new) translation of a play, the director may also work with the playwright or translator. In contemporary theatre, after the [[playwright]], the director is generally the primary visionary, making decisions on the artistic concept and interpretation of the play and its staging. Different directors occupy different places of authority and responsibility, depending on the structure and philosophy of individual theatre companies. Directors use a wide variety of techniques, philosophies, and levels of collaboration.

== The director in theatre history ==
In [[ancient Greece]], the birthplace of European drama, the writer bore principal responsibility for the staging of his plays. Actors were generally semi-professionals, and the director oversaw the mounting of plays from the writing process all the way through to their performance, often acting in them too, as [[Aeschylus]] for example did. The author-director would also train the [[choir|chorus]], sometimes compose the music, and supervise every aspect of production. The fact that the director was called ''didaskalos'', the Greek word for "teacher," indicates that the work of these early directors combined instructing their performers with staging their work.&lt;ref&gt;Brocket, Oscar G.: ''History of the Theatre''. 8th ed. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1999, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jean Fouquet - The Martyrdom of St Apollonia - WGA08031.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Fouquet]]:'' The Martyrdom of St. Appollonia'' (1460), depicting the staging of a mystery play, led by a theatre director]]
In [[medieval]] times, the complexity of vernacular religious drama, with its large scale [[mystery plays]] that often included crowd scenes, processions and elaborate effects, gave the role of director (or ''stage manager'' or ''pageant master'') considerable importance. A miniature by [[Jean Fouquet]] from 1460 (pictured) bears one of the earliest depictions of a director at work. Holding a prompt book, the central figure directs, with the aid of a long stick, the proceedings of the staging of a dramatization of the ''Martyrdom of [[Saint Apollonia]]''. According to Fouquet, the director's tasks included overseeing the erecting of a stage and scenery (there were no permanent, purpose-built theatre structures at this time, and performances of vernacular drama mostly took place in the open air), casting and directing the actors (which included fining them for those that infringed rules), and addressing the audience at the beginning of each performance and after each intermission.&lt;ref&gt;Brocket, ''op.cit.'', p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[Renaissance]] times up until the 19th century, the role of director was often carried by the ''[[actor-manager]]''. This would usually be a senior actor in a troupe who took the responsibility for choosing the repertoire of work, staging it and managing the company. This was the case for instance with [[Commedia dell'Arte]] companies and English actor-managers like [[Colley Cibber]] and [[David Garrick]].

[[Image:Stanislavsky.jpg|thumb|left|A portrait of [[Constantin Stanislavski]] by [[Valentin Serov]]]]
The modern theatre director can be said to have originated in the staging of elaborate spectacles of the Meininger Company under George II, Duke of [[Saxe-Meiningen]]. The management of large numbers of extras and complex stagecraft matters necessitated an individual to take on the role of overall coordinator.&lt;ref&gt;Russel Brown, John (ed.): ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Theatre''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; This gave rise to the role of the director in modern theatre, and [[Germany]] would provide a platform for a generation of emerging visionary theatre directors, such as [[Erwin Piscator]] and [[Max Reinhardt]]. Simultaneously, [[Constantin Stanislavski]], principally an actor-manager, would set up the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] in [[Russia]] and similarly emancipate the role of the director as artistic visionary.

The French ''regisseur'' is also sometimes used to mean a stage director, most commonly in [[ballet]]. A more common term for theatre director in French is ''metteur en scène''.

Post [[World War II]], the [[actor-manager]] slowly started to disappear, and directing become a fully fledged artistic activity within the theatre profession. The director originating artistic vision and concept, and realizing the staging of a production, became the norm rather than the exception. Great forces in the emancipation of theatre directing as a profession were notable 20th-century theatre directors like [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]], [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]],
[[Yevgeny Vakhtangov]], [[Michael Chekhov]], [[Yuri Lyubimov]] (Russia), [[Orson Welles]], [[Peter Brook]], [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall]] (Britain), [[Bertolt Brecht]] (Germany), [[Giorgio Strehler]] and [[Franco Zeffirelli]] (Italy).

A cautionary note was introduced by the famed director Sir [[Tyrone Guthrie]] who said "the only way to learn how to direct a play, is ... to get a group of actors simple enough to allow you to let you direct them, and direct".{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

A number of seminal works on directing and directors include Toby Cole and Helen Krich's 1972 ''Directors on Directing: A Sourcebook of the Modern Theatre'', Edward Braun's 1982 book ''The Director and the Stage: From Naturalism to Growtowski'' and Will's ''The Director in a Changing Theatre'' (1976).&lt;ref&gt;Eckersley, M. 1998. ''Soundings in the Dramaturgy of the Australian Theatre Director.'' University of Melbourne. Melbourne. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Directing education ==
Because of the relatively late emergence of theatre directing as a performing arts profession when compared with for instance acting or musicianship, a rise of professional vocational training programmes in directing can be seen mostly in the second half of the 20th century. Most European countries nowadays know some form of professional directing training, usually at [[drama school]]s or [[College or university school of music|conservatoires]], or at universities. In Britain, the tradition that theatre directors emerge from degree courses (usually in English literature) at the [[Oxbridge]] universities has meant that for a long time, professional vocational training did not take place at drama schools or performing arts colleges, although an increase in training programmes for theatre directors can be witnessed since the 1970s and 1980s.  In American universities, the seminal directing program at the [[Yale School of Drama]] produced a number of pioneering directors with D.F.A. (Doctor of Fine Arts) and M.F.A. degrees in Drama (rather than English) who contributed to the expansion of professional resident theaters in the 1960s and 1970s.  In the early days such programmes typically led to the staging of one major thesis production in the third (final) year.  At the [[University of California, Irvine]], [[Keith Fowler]] (a Yale D.F.A. and ex-producer of two LORT companies) led for many years a graduate programme based on the premise that directors are autodidacts who need as many opportunities to direct as possible.  Under Fowler, graduate student directors would stage between five and ten productions during their three-year residencies, with each production receiving detailed critiques.

As with many other professions in the performing arts, theatre directors would often learn their skills "on the job"; to this purpose, theatres often employ trainee assistant directors or have in-house education schemes to train young theatre directors. Examples are the [[Royal National Theatre]] in [[London]], which frequently organizes short directing courses, or the [[Orange Tree Theatre]] and the [[Donmar Warehouse]] on London's [[West End theatre|West End]], which both employ resident assistant directors on a one-year basis for training purposes.

== Styles of directing ==
Directing is an artform that has grown with the development of theatre theory and theatre practice. With the emergence of new 
trends in theatre, so too have directors adopted new methodologies and engaged in new practices.Interpretation of the drama, by the late twentieth century, had become central to the director’s work. Relativism and psychoanalytic theory influenced the work of innovative directors such as [[Peter Brook]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Peter Stein]], and [[George Strehler]]. &lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Michael: ‘’Thinking Like a Director’’ page 13. Farrar, Strauss, and Giroux, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a show has opened (premiered before a regular audience), theatre directors are generally considered to have fulfilled their function. From that point forward the [[Stage management|stage manager]] is left in charge of all essential concerns.

'''''Viva Elvis''''' is the soundtrack remix album of the [[Cirque du Soleil]] show ''[[Viva Elvis]]'', which focuses on the life and music of American singer and musician [[Elvis Presley]]. The album, though initially produced as a soundtrack to the show, does not include all of the songs featured in the show. The CD tracks are rearranged and extended versions of songs heard in the show, and in fact the album includes two instrumental versions of the songs "[[Memories (Elvis Presley song)|Memories]]" and "[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]", neither of which is in the Cirque du Soleil show.

This album marks the third official posthumous album by Elvis Presley created from scratch, whereas previous albums were compilations of previously released or unreleased studio material recorded well before his death. The two prior albums were the urban country-influenced 1981 ''Guitar Man'' record and the 2008 ''[[Christmas Duets]]'' CD. Similar to Cirque du Soleil's soundtrack to the [[Beatles]]-themed ''[[Love (Cirque du Soleil)|Love]]'', "Viva Elvis" contains samples from throughout the entire span of Elvis Presley's career, including interview clips, [[home recordings]], studio [[outtakes]] and snippets of dialogue from Elvis's feature films.

Unlike ''Love'', however, ''Viva Elvis'' features new backing instrumentation on each track in an attempt to modernize the arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allmusic.com/album/viva-elvis-the-album-r2030682 Allmusic.com review of the album]&lt;/ref&gt; This has met with a mixed critical response, with some reviewers praising the production quality and others opining that Elvis's music is best left untampered with.

'''Xtreme Fighting Championships''' ('''XFC''') is a premier international [[mixed martial arts]] (MMA) organization based in [[Spring Lake, Michigan|Spring Lake]], [[Michigan]], with offices throughout the [[United States]] and [[South America]]. The XFC showcases both male and female fighters, advocates young MMA fighters, and produces stadium fight cards in various locations in the United States and South America, including [[Florida]], [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], [[Michigan]], [[Brazil]], [[São Paulo]], [[Campinas]], and [[Araraquara]]. It is often confused with EFC Worldwide.

Throughout 2008-2012, the XFC hosted 4–6 events per year, travelling around the USA and [[Greece]]. In 2013, the company announced its new executive team, as well as a broadcast partnership with an open broadcaster in South America, [[RedeTV!|Rede TV!]]. This began the International Tournament &amp; Super-Fight Series. The unprecedented success of the 2014 Season I Series allowed the XFC to secure various partnerships with various global broadcasters, including Terra TV, [[HBO]] America, and [[Universo Online|UOL]]. The XFC currently features more than 125 MMA fighters from 23 countries.

==History==

===XFC 1: Dynamite===
The organization's first stadium event was called '''XFC 1: Dynamite''' and was staged at the [[St. Pete Times Forum]] in [[Tampa]], [[Florida]] on November 11, 2007.  The show officially drew over 11,000 MMA fans, tripling the former record for attendance at an MMA event in the state of Florida.&lt;ref name="Tampa Tribune"&gt;{{cite web|date=November 12, 2007 |url=http://www.mmaxfc.com/PressReleases/PR6.html |title=Record Crowd Flocks To MMA Event At Forum |publisher=Tampa Tribune |accessdate=2007-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203232535/http://www.mmaxfc.com/PressReleases/PR6.html |archivedate=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, XFC president John Prisco claims that the actual attendance number was closer to 13,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===XFC 2: Rage in the Cage===
The XFC returned to the St. Pete Times forum on March 2, 2008, with a show called '''XFC 2: Rage in the Cage'''.
