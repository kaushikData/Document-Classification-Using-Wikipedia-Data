      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3708">'''''Focus on Algebra''''' was the widely cited 812-page-long [[algebra]] [[textbook]] which contained significant content outside the traditional field of mathematics. The real-life context, intended to make mathematics more relevant, included chili recipes, ancient myths, and photographs of famous people.

Although it was a widely used textbook, it made headlines when it was dubbed "rainforest algebra" by  critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texnews.com/opinion97/neill110297.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051116171243/http://www.texnews.com/opinion97/neill110297.html |archivedate=2005-11-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Senate Testimony ==
Senator [[Robert Byrd]], Democrat from West Virginia, joined critics of [[reform mathematics]] on the floor of the senate by dubbing '''Addison-Wesley Secondary Math: An Integrated Approach: Focus on Algebra''' the "Texas rainforest algebra book,". It had received an "F" grade on a report card produced by [[Mathematically Correct]], a back-to-basics group, who claimed that it had no algebraic content on the first hundred pages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ednews.org/articles/2332/1/Defining-Quality-Standards-A-Textbook-Example/Page1.html] Defining Quality Standards: A Textbook Example Education News Friday, April 21, 2006
By Terri Leo&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

Each of the 10 Chapters was composed of two or three themes, or "Superlessons," each of which connected the algebraic content to another discipline. Each Superlesson began with an opening page with discussion questions relating to the theme. Critics of the programs cited these questions as evidence of the lack of math in the books.

Examples of questions cited:

* What other kinds of [[pollution]] besides air pollution might threaten our planet? [page 163, in the introduction to 3-1 Functional Relationships]
* Each year the Oilfield Chili Appreciation Society holds a [[Chili con carne|chili]] cook-off. . . . 1. The chili cook-off raises money for charity. Describe some ways the organizers could raise money in the cook- off. 2. What is the hottest kind of pepper that you have eaten? People who have tasted them agree that cayenne peppers are hotter than pimento peppers. How would you set up a hotness scale for peppers? . . . . [page 217, in the introduction to 4-1 Solving Linear Equations]
* What role should [[zoo]]s play in today's society? . . . . [page 233, in the introduction to 4-2 Other Techniques for Solving Linear Equations]

Exercises within lessons that related to the theme were also criticized. One example:

* '''Creative Writing''' The zoo sponsors a creative writing contest for high school students. The topic for the essay this year is "Why should we save an endangered species? The prize winners will split a $9000 scholarship. The prize for first place is 3 times that of third place. The prize for second place is $1500 more than that for third place. a. How much money will be awarded for each place? b. If you were in charge of awarding the prizes, would you have awarded the same amounts for the places. Why or why not? c. Suppose you are a judge. What would you use as criteria for judging the essay? [page 253]

[[File:Architects Registration Board logo.svg|thumb|Architects Registration Board logo]]
The '''Architects Registration Board''' (ARB) is the statutory body for the registration of architects in the United Kingdom. It operates under the [[Architects Act 1997]] as [[Architects Act 1997 : amendment of June 2008 under the European Communities Act 1972|amended]], a [[consolidating Act]]. It began under the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects (Registration) Act, 1931]] which gave it the name the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] (ARCUK). It prescribes architectural qualifications, maintains the [[Register of Architects]] and for registered persons has certain responsibilities for standards of professional conduct and competence. Its main source of income is fees payable under Part II of the Act by persons on their becoming registered or for their retention on the Register. The Board is required to pay into the [[Consolidated Fund]] of the United Kingdom any sum paid under a penalty order which its Professional Conduct Committee has made under Part III of the Act (in conduct cases). Fines imposed by [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)]] (or similar in Scotland or Northern Ireland) under Part IV of the Act (in misuse of title cases) are not payable to the Board.

In the Board's Annual Report for the year 2011&lt;ref name="2011.arb.org.uk"&gt;[http://2011.arb.org.uk/downloads/arb-annual-report-2011.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Reserves were stated as Surplus for the year £186,621 and Balance (net assets) at 31 December 2011 as £1,757,901.

Surpluses are not distributable to the Board members or to registered persons by way of dividend or otherwise.

==Registration==
A Registrar, who may be an employee of the Board or its contractor, is appointed for the purpose of admitting persons to the Register or placing them on the list of visiting EU architects and, in some instances, causing matters concerning conduct and competence to be investigated.

==Prescribing qualifications==
As the UK "competent authority" for the purpose of Article 46 of the Mutual
Recognition of Professional Qualifications Directive (2005/36/EC), the ARB has published its procedures for the prescription of qualifications for persons applying for registration under section 4 of the Architects Act 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arb.org.uk/prescription-of-qualifications ARB website]&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Discipline" in the Architects Act 1997 (as amended)==
The primary meaning of "discipline" traditionally refers to education, with the meaning of a branch of knowledge (as: "in what discipline is his doctorate?"; "teachers should be well trained in their subject"; "anthropology is the study of ...).&lt;ref name="Discipline : definition"&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;aq=5h&amp;oq=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1T4RNWN_enGB333GB334&amp;q=define%3adiscipline Discipline : definition]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Architects Act 1997 (as amended) education is referred to in Part II which is headed "Registration etc.", not in Part III which is headed "Discipline". References in Part II are:
:"educational establishments" in section 4A(2)(c)(i);
:"education and training " in section 6(2A);
:"educational bodies" in section 6(3)(b);
:"architectural education" in section 6A.
:"The Education Fund" is mentioned in SCHEDULE 2 (Section 27, Transitional Provisions).

In Part III of the Architects Act 1997 "Discipline" is being used in one of the secondary meanings, such as:

:punish to gain control or enforce obedience: "The teacher disciplined the pupils rather frequently";

:the act of punishing: "The offenders deserved the harsh discipline they received"&lt;ref name="Discipline : definition"/&gt;

==Professional Conduct Committee of the ARB==

The legislation requires there to be a Professional Conduct Committee of the Board (whose remuneration or expenses are decided and paid by the Board as the corporate body). The function of this Committee is to hear and determine allegations against registered persons which have been formally reported or referred to it in accordance with the Architects Act 1997 (as amended) and the Rules which the Board is authorised to make. In practice the allegations are usually presented to the Committee by a solicitor appointed and paid by the Board; and the Committee usually has a legally qualified chairman chosen from those who (male or female) are required by the legislation to have been appointed to membership of the Committee on the nomination of the President&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/opinion/topresident039s-podium/law-society039s-new-president-will-focus-039the-rule-law039 Rule of law] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929072508/http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/opinion/topresident039s-podium/law-society039s-new-president-will-focus-039the-rule-law039 |date=29 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Law Society of England and Wales|Law Society]].

The Act states explicitly that failure to comply with the provisions of the code of professional conduct issued by the Board shall not be taken of itself to constitute unacceptable professional conduct. The Act also provides for the publication of a statement exonerating an architect against whom an allegation of unacceptable professional conduct or serious professional incompetence has not been sustained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/22/part/III section 15 (5)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial precedent==

On an appeal to the [[Divisional Court]] in 1957 concerning a pure breach of the Code of Professional Conduct under the legislation then in force (the architect was practising an estate agent's business as well as his own), when the registration body was constituted under the name the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]], [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Mr Justice Devlin]] ruled: "It is not of itself disgraceful to disagree with a majority view and to act accordingly. It is only if a man has bound himself in honour to accept that view and to act according to the code that a deliberate breach of the code for his own profit can be called disgraceful". In the course of giving judgment in this appeal Lord Chief Justice Goddard had mentioned a letter which had been sent in 1937 by "the president of the council" [sic] to the Institute of Chartered Surveyors recognising the fact that there was nothing in a Bill, which the council was then promoting (and which subsequently became the Architects Registration Act, 1938), to interfere with the activities of registered architects.&lt;ref&gt;''Hughes v [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom|Architects' Registration Council'']][1957] 2 Q.B. 550, cited in Hudson's Building and Engineering Contracts, 11th ed., para 2.015, and 12th ed., para 2.007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The decisive issues concerning the legislation for the Register of Architects==

Records held by the [[British Architectural Library]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/RIBALibrary/Catalogue.aspx British Architectural Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/v/vam-riba-collections administrative archive of RIBA at V&amp;A]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angela Mace and Robert Thorne ''The Royal Institute of British Architects: a guide to its archive and history'', Mansell Pub.,1986.&lt;/ref&gt; show that from the 1890s the motivations for promoting and opposing a registration act had been mixed. But the content of the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|originating act of 1931 as amended by the act of 1938]] shows that the decisive issue at that time was the importance attached to giving to architects the responsibility of superintending or supervising the building works of local authorities (for housing and other projects), rather than to persons professionally qualified only as municipal or other engineers. A significant indicator for this inference is in section 1 (1) of the 1938 act.&lt;ref&gt;See also the [[Ernest Simon, 1st Baron Simon of Wythenshawe|Simon]] Report, HMSO 1944, reprint 1952, and a ruling of the [[King's Bench]] Divisional Court, R. v. Architects' Registration Tribunal, ex p. Jagger, [1945] 2 All E.R. 151, both mentioned in "The law relating to the architect" by E. J. Rimmer, Stevens 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s that issue had had its day, to be replaced by another which has resulted in the current legislation: the Architects Act 1997 as amended.&lt;ref&gt;[[Architects Act 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt; The issue which emerged in the 1970s developed into the obligation imposed on the United Kingdom and other European governments to comply with European Union Directives concerning the designation of "competent authorities" in connection with the mutual recognition of professional qualifications in favour of equal standards across borders, in furtherance of the single market policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaruk.info/AARU%20Act3.htm#2 About Architects Registration in the United Kingdom]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspection of the Register==
In connection with the protection of title and the enforcement provisions, the originating and later legislation imposed on the registration body (now the ARB) a requirement to provide copies of the Register annually. Formerly, hard bound copies of all volumes in the annual series, from volume 1 for 1933, were available for inspection by members of the public at the British Architectural Library of the Royal Institute of British Architects, London. Latterly, some hiatus on the part of the Board in producing printed copies of the Register in accordance with the legislation and the Board's previous practice has impeded the continuation of the series for retention (on the part of the British Architectural Library or others) as annual volumes for reference. The current website offers only a downloadable pdf format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arb.org.uk/publications-list]&lt;/ref&gt;

For other more limited purposes and for commercial and similar purposes names of persons currently registered can be searched online at a website maintained by the registration body. The information held on this version of the Register could help members of the public, who wish to find an architect to meet their needs, to locate a practitioner who has registered status and is conveniently situated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architects-register.org.uk/ The Register of Architects] and as explained in ARB ebulletin of May 2012 [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120604184515/http%3A//www.arb.org.uk/publications/ebulletin/arbebulletin_05_12.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Income==
The Board's published Income and Expenditure Statement for the year ended 31 December 2011&lt;ref name="2011.arb.org.uk"/&gt; showed a Total operating income of £2,962,329 as the sum of Registration and retention fees £2,733,178 + Prescribed examinations £171,312 + (reinstatement) Penalties and sundry receipts £22,564 + Sales of the register of architects (''actually, copies of'') £1,480 + Investment income £33,795. Of those figures, Registration fees were £59,492; Retention fees £2,673,686; Penalties (imposed under the Board's General Rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.arb.org.uk/publications/rules_and_policies/general_rules.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902121245/http://www.arb.org.uk/publications/rules_and_policies/general_rules.php |archivedate=2 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) on reinstatement to the Register £19,180. The Board's scale of fees with effect from January 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arb.org.uk/registration/maintaining_registration/retention_and_other_fees/other_fees.php]&lt;/ref&gt; included a fee for Prescribed Examination of £1,390 per part (under section 4 of the Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.org.uk/news_and_information/information_for_architects/the_architects_act/part_2a.php#4 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301001950/http://www.arb.org.uk/news_and_information/information_for_architects/the_architects_act/part_2a.php |archivedate=1 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[File:Une canne de marchand Châlus.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Wooden Cane]]

An '''assistive cane''' is a [[walking stick]] used as a [[crutch]] or [[mobility aid]].

Canes can help redistribute weight from a lower leg that is weak or painful, improve stability by increasing the base of support, and provide tactile information about the ground to improve balance. In the US, ten percent of adults older than 65 years use canes, and 4.6 percent use walkers.&lt;ref name="AFP"&gt;{{cite journal

In contrast to crutches, canes are generally lighter, but, because they transfer the load through the user's unsupported wrist, are unable to offload equal loads from the legs.

Another type of crutch is the [[walker (tool)|walker]], a frame held in front of the user and which the user leans on during movement. Walkers are more stable due to their increased area of ground contact, but are larger and less wieldy and, like canes, pass the full load through the user's wrists in most cases.

== Parts of medical canes ==
[[File:Quadcane.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Bottom of a quad cane showing ferrules]]
The basic cane has four parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.fashionablecanes.com/canes/cane-anatomy.html |publisher=FashionableCanes.com |title=Anatomy of a Walking Cane |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017100932/http://www.fashionablecanes.com/canes/cane-anatomy.html |archivedate=2009-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These parts vary depending on the design of the cane and the needs of the user.
* '''Handle'''. The handle of a cane is extremely important to the user. Many different styles exist, the most common traditional designs are the Tourist, or crook handle, the Fritz Handle and the Derby Handle. Ergonomically shaped handles have become increasingly common for canes intended for medical use, both increasing the comfort of the grip for the user (particularly important for users with disabilities which also affect their hands or wrists), and better transmitting the load from the user's hand and arm into the shaft.
* '''Collar'''. The collar of a cane may be only a decorative addition made for stylistic reasons, or may form the structural interface between shaft and handle.
* '''Shaft'''. The shaft of the cane transmits the load from the handle to the ferrule and may be constructed from [[carbon fiber polymer]], metal, composites, or traditional wood.
* '''Ferrule'''. The tip of a cane provides traction and added support when the cane is used at an angle. Many kinds of ferrules exist, but most common is a simple, ridged rubber stopper. Users can easily replace a ferrule with one that better suits their individual needs.

Modern canes may differ from the traditional fixed structure. For instance, a quad cane has a base attached to the shaft that provides increased stability by having four ferrules, and an adjustable cane may have two shaft segments telescoping one inside the other to allow adjustment for multiple sizes.

All cane users who need a walking cane for medical reasons should consult a medical professional before choosing the style that best suits them. It is particularly important that the cane is the proper height for the individual user.

== Types of canes ==
{{Stack|
[[File:Long cane.jpg|alt=|thumb|50px|White Cane]]
[[File:Strongarm cane design 4 lg.jpg|alt=|thumb|100px|Forearm crutch/cane]]
}}
*'''[[White cane]]''': specifically designed for assisting the [[blindness|visually impaired]], these are longer and thinner and allow the user to "feel" the path ahead. They also alert others, such as motorists, to know the user is blind and therefore use caution. In the UK, red banding on a white cane indicates a deaf-blind user.
*'''Folding cane''': has several joints, generally linked by an internal elastic cord, enabling them to be folded into a shorter length when not in use.
*'''Forearm cane''': a regular or offset cane with additional forearm support, enabling increased stability and load shifted from the wrist to the forearm.
*'''Quad cane''': has four ferrules at the base, enabling them to stand freely, and offering a more firm base for standing.
*'''Tripod cane''': opens in a [[tripod]] fashion. Often available with an attached seat.
*'''Adjustable cane''': features two or more shaft pieces for a telescoping effect that allows the user to lengthen or shorten their walking cane to fit to size. This feature can be combined with other variations.
*'''[[Shillelagh (club)|Shillelagh]]''': a cane made of [[blackthorn]] wood, originating in Ireland and still a recognized symbol thereof.

== Accessories ==
* The most common accessory is a hand strap, to prevent loss of the stick should the hand release its grip. These are often threaded through a hole drilled into the stick rather than tied around.
* A clip-on frame or similar device can be used to hold a stick against the top of a table.
* In cold climates, a metallic [[Cleat (shoe)|cleat]] may be added to the foot of the cane. This dramatically increases traction on ice. The device is usually designed so it can easily rotate to the side to prevent damage to indoor flooring.
* Different handles are available to better match the size of the user's hands and their medical needs.
* Rubber [[ferrule]]s give extra traction on most surfaces.

== Handedness ==
Canes are generally held in the hand that is opposite to the side of the injury or weakness. It allows the cane to be used for stability in a way that lets the user focus much of their weight away from their weaker side and onto the cane. This prevents the person's center of balance from swaying from side to side as they walk. It also allows for fluid movement that better matches walking, as the hand on the opposite side of the leg generally sways forward in normal human locomotion . Personal preference, or a need to hold the cane in the [[handedness|dominant hand]] means some cane users choose to hold the cane on the same side as the affected leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://physicaltherapy.about.com/od/devicesandorthotics/qt/WalkingwaCane.htm | publisher = About | title = Walking Cane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese government award for outstanding self-financed student study abroad was established by the [[China Scholarship Council]] in 2003. The worldwide recipients are chosen annually based on a record of outstanding accomplishments in any discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csc.edu.cn/chuguo/s/596|title=2016年"国家优秀自费留学生奖学金"项目启动实施|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This award is considered the highest award given by Chinese government to the graduate student study outside China, who do not receive financial support from Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=国家优秀自费留学生奖学金项目介绍|url=http://yxzfs.csc.edu.cn/scholarship/doc/xiangmujieshao.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date,the recipants include students from 33 countries, including United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Australia and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chemistry.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/njw/group/?wg_news=chinese-government-award-for-outstanding-students-abroad|title=

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4726">'''Chris Nance''' (October 12, 1940, [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] — October 27, 2014, [[New York City]]) was an American [[conducting|conductor]] and music educator. Primarily active as an opera conductor, he served on the conducting staff of the [[New York City Opera]] from 1969-1974 and was the music administrator and conductor of the [[Houston Grand Opera]] from 1974-1977. Thereafter he worked as a freelance conductor with opera companies throughout the world. He became particularly associated with [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' for which he was frequently hired to conduct at opera houses both in the United States and abroad.

==Life and career==
Born in Charlottesville, Virginia, Nance earned a bachelor of music degree from the [[University of Southern California]] in 1963 where he was a conducting pupil of [[Ingolf Dahl]]. He then joined the music faculty at [[Louisiana State University]] where he taught from 1963–1969. He left that position to pursue summer graduate studies in conducting under [[Walter Ducloux]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] where he earned a master's degree in 1972.&lt;ref name="ON"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2015/4/Departments/Obituaries.html|title=Obituary: Chris Nance|work=[[Opera News]]|date=April 2015|volume=79|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a student at the University of Texas at Austin, Nance began his conducting career as the chorus master at the [[New York City Opera]] from 1969-1974. In 1970 he began taking on conducting assignments at the NYCO, beginning with ''[[Rigoletto]]''. Over the next four years he led performances of ''[[Carmen]]'', ''[[Cavalleria Rusticana]]'', ''[[La Traviata]]'', ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'', ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'', and ''[[Pagliacci]]''. In 1974 he left the NYCO to become the music administrator and conductor of the [[Houston Grand Opera]]. He notably led performances of the lauded 1976 HGO productions of [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' and [[Scott Joplin]]'s ''[[Treemonisha]]''; taking both shows on National tours.&lt;ref name="ON"/&gt;

Nance left the HGO in 1977 and began working as a freelance conductor on the international stage. ''Porgy and Bess'' became a calling card of his, with him leading performances of the work at the [[Calgary Opera]], the [[Cologne Opera]], the [[Dutch National Opera]], the [[Florentine Opera]], the [[Leipzig Opera]], the [[Prinzregententheater]] in Munich, [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma]], the [[Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi]] in Trieste, the [[Teatro Municipale (Reggio Emilia)|Teatro Municipale]] in Reggio Emilia, [[Theater am Goetheplatz]] in Bremen, the [[Théâtre du Châtelet]] in Paris, the [[Tokyo Bunka Kaikan]], the [[Tulsa Opera]], the [[Vienna State Opera]], and the [[Zurich Opera]] among others.&lt;ref name="ON"/&gt;

In 1983 Nance made his conducting debut with the [[Los Angeles Opera]], leading the United States premiere of [[Iain Hamilton (composer)|Iain Hamilton]]’s ''[[Anna Karenina (Hamilton)|Anna Karenina]]''. He conducted that work again in 1985 for his debut with the [[English National Opera]]. That same year he  conducted the world premiere performance of Hamilton’s ''[[Lancelot (opera)|Lancelot]]'' at the [[Arundel Festival]].&lt;ref name="ON"/&gt;

In 1989 Nance returned to the NYCO as a freelancer after a long absence, leading the company in performances of ''[[La Bohème]]'' that included [[Renée Fleming]] in her debut role with the company as Mimi. He worked for the company on several more productions over the next three years, including conducting performances of [[Kurt Weil]]'s ''[[Street Scene (opera)|Street Scene]]'' (1990), [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1990), [[Frank Loesser]]'s ''[[The Most Happy Fella]]'' (1991) and [[Sigmund Romberg]]'s ''[[The Desert Song]]'' (1992).&lt;ref name="ON"/&gt;

Nance also enjoyed lengthy and fruitful associations freelance conducting with the [[Cincinnati Opera]], [[New Orleans Opera Association]], [[Hawaii Opera Theatre]] and [[Opera Grand Rapids]]. Other companies he conducted for during his career include the [[Pittsburgh Opera]], the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] in Mexico City and at the [[San Antonio Opera]] among others.

In 2010, Savage and his husband, Terry Miller, began the [[It Gets Better Project]] to help prevent [[suicide among LGBT youth]]. He has also worked as a theater director, sometimes credited as '''Keenan Hollahan.'''

Born in [[Chicago]] to [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] parents, Savage attended the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] where he received a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in acting. He lived in [[West Berlin]] briefly from 1988 to 1990, and later moved to [[Madison, Wisconsin]], where he befriended Tim Keck, co-founder of ''[[The Onion]]''. When Keck moved to [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], Savage moved as well to become an advice columnist for [[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]], which Keck founded; he had offered Savage the position after Savage wrote a sample column which impressed him. Savage has since become a [[sex columnist]] and a vocal proponent of [[LGBT rights in the United States]], voicing his advocacy through ''The Stranger'' and his [[podcast]] ''[[Savage Love]]''. 

Outside of his writings and podcasts, Savage has advocated for [[progressivism in the United States|progressive]] politics and advancing the rights of LGBT youth to prevent [[Suicide among LGBT youth|suicide in the community]]. He has opposed laws restricting [[pornography]] and the sale of [[sex toy]]s, and founded the [[It Gets Better Project]] with his husband Terry Miller, who he married in 2010 and had their marriage recognized in Washington in 2012. Savage has been featured on numerous television programs and news outlets, including ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]'' and ''[[Anderson Cooper 360]].'' He supported the concept of the [[Iraq War]] in 2002 but changed his stance following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion]].

He [[Campaign for the neologism "santorum"|coined the term "santorum" to define a sex act]] after former [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Rick Santorum]] made anti-LGBT comments in 2003, and condemned [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] for its support of [[California Proposition 8]], which banned [[same-sex marriage]] in California. His activism and public speaking has brought praise from celebrities and politicians, including former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]].

==Career==

===''Savage Love''===
{{Main|Savage Love}}
In 1991, Savage was living in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], and working as a night manager at Four Star Fiction and Video (now Four Star Video Cooperative), a local video store that specialized in independent film titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=15650534|title=Savage Love|work=The Stranger|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fourstarvideocoop.com/|title=Four Star Video Cooperative|website=fourstarvideocoop.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GLBTQ Bio" /&gt; He befriended Tim Keck, co-founder of ''[[The Onion]],'' who announced that he was moving to Seattle to help start an alternative weekly newspaper titled ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]].''&lt;ref name="GLBTQ Bio" /&gt; Savage "made the offhand comment that forever altered [his] life: 'Make sure your paper has an advice column—everybody claims to hate 'em, but everybody seems to read 'em'."&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, Introduction, ''Savage Love: Straight Answers from America's Most Popular Sex Columnist'' (New York: Plume, 1998), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Savage wrote a sample column, and to his surprise, Keck offered him the job.&lt;ref name="AV-club"&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/45150 Dan Savage interviewed by Tasha Robinson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217225248/http://www.avclub.com/content/node/45150 |date=February 17, 2006 }}, ''The A.V. Club'', February 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, Introduction, ''Savage Love: Straight Answers from America's Most Popular Sex Columnist'', op. cit., pp. 1–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Savage stated in a February 2006 interview in ''The Onion''{{'}}s ''[[The A.V. Club|A.V. Club]]'' (which publishes his column) that he began the column with the express purpose of providing mocking advice to heterosexuals, since most straight advice columnists were "clueless" when responding to letters from gay people.&lt;ref name="AV-club"/&gt; Savage wanted to call the column "Hey, Faggot!" in an effort to [[reclaimed word|reclaim a hate word]]. His editors at the time refused his choice of column name, but for the first several years of the column, he attached "Hey, Faggot!" at the beginning of each printed letter as a salutation."&lt;ref name=hey&gt;Dan Savage, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=340 "Savage Love: Farewell, Faggot"], ''The Stranger'', February 25, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In his February 25, 1999, column, Savage announced that he was retiring the phrase, claiming that the reclamation had been successful.&lt;ref name=hey/&gt;

He has written in a number of columns about "straight rights" concerns, such as the [[HPV vaccine]] and the [[morning-after pill]]. In his November 9, 2005, column he wrote that "[t]he right-wingers and the fundies and the sex-phobes don't just have it in for the queers. They're coming for your asses too."

===Theater===
As a theater director, Savage (under the name Keenan Hollohan, combining his middle name and his paternal grandmother's maiden name&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kittenpants.org/09_winners/dansavage2.htm Kittenpants interview with Dan Savage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051024115713/http://www.kittenpants.org/09_winners/dansavage2.htm |date=October 24, 2005 }}, ''Kittenpants'', [http://www.kittenpants.org/09_winners/pageone.htm 04.10.01 Issue 9] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051024061121/http://www.kittenpants.org/09_winners/pageone.htm |date=October 24, 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a founder of Seattle's Greek Active Theater.&lt;ref name="After Elton" /&gt; Much of the group's work were [[queer]] interpretations of classic works, such as a tragicomic ''[[Macbeth]]'' with both the [[Macbeth (character)|title character]] and [[Lady Macbeth (Shakespeare)|Lady Macbeth]] played by performers of the opposite sex.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} In March 2001, he directed his own ''Egguus'' at [[Consolidated Works]], a parody of [[Peter Shaffer]]'s 1973 play ''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]'' which exchanged a fixation on horses for a fixation on chickens.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

''[[Letters from the Earth]]'' (2003), also at Consolidated Works, was Savage's most recent production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kiley|first=Brendan|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/on-stage/Content?oid=13727 |title=On Stage Killer Dickens, Trite Twain, Nifty Neel, Limp Lonergan |date= 20–26 March 2003|work=The Stranger|accessdate=September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Letters'' was a trimmed version of [[Mark Twain]]'s ''The Diary of Adam and Eve.''

He has also made multiple appearances on [[MSNBC]]'s ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]'' and [[CNN]]'s ''[[Anderson Cooper 360]]'', to discuss LGBT political issues, such as [[same-sex marriage]] and [[Don't Ask Don't Tell]].

In 2014, he participated in ''[[Do I Sound Gay?]]'', a documentary film by [[David Thorpe (journalist)|David Thorpe]] about [[stereotypes]] of gay men's speech patterns.&lt;ref name=thr&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/do-i-sound-gay-toronto-731253 "'Do I Sound Gay?': Toronto Review"].

It features Savage answering anonymous questions left by callers on a voice recorder ([[answering machine]]). He often returns calls to questioners who give their phone numbers, and such phone calls are part of the podcast. He also consults with doctors, [[sex therapists]], and other experts for answers to questions he calls "above my pay grade". There are frequent guest co-hosts, all of them sex-positive. It is routinely rated as the top podcast in the iTunes "Health" category and in the top 20 of all podcasts overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Apple|first=iTunes|title=Top Health Podcast Episodes|url=https://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/|publisher=Apple|accessdate=February 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A.V.

===''The Real O'Neals''===
{{Main|The Real O'Neals}}
Based on an idea by Savage (who also served as executive producer), the ABC-TV series, ''[[The Real O'Neals]]'' starring [[Noah Galvin]] debuted in 2016. The series chronicles the lives of a close-knit, Irish-American Chicago Catholic family whose matriarch takes their reputation in the community very seriously. In the pilot episode, their perfect image is shattered when each family member has a secret revealed to the community: middle child Kenny is gay, oldest child Jimmy is anorexic, youngest child Shannon is running a money scam and might be an atheist, and parents Eileen and Pat are no longer in love and wish to divorce. The series lasted for two seasons before its cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/05/11/dr-ken-canceled-abc/|title=Dr. Ken and two more comedies canceled by ABC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hump pornography festival ===
{{main|HUMP! (film festival)}}
Savage has always been pro-[[pornography]], especially [[Internet pornography]]. He often remarks that the Internet was invented ''for'' pornography.

Savage coordinates the annual Hump pornography festival, which is made up of clips of up to five minutes on any pornographic topic, submitted by viewers. Winning submissions are shown in theaters around the United States, providing a unique experience as straight, gay male, bi, lesbian, and fetish porn are all shown together, one after another. Savage publicly destroys the submissions after conclusion of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Hump2014/, consulted June 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political advocacy ===
[[Image:DanSavagecrop.jpg|thumb|right|Dan Savage at the 5th Avenue High School Musical Theatre Awards, 2006]]
Savage tends to [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] political views, with pronounced contrarian and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] streaks.&lt;ref name="SFGate"&gt;{{cite web|author=Buchanan, Wyatt|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/10/21/DDGKTF7E2L39.DTL|title=Marriage Can Be Right For Us All, says Dan Savage.

He wrote that he licked doorknobs and other objects in the campaign office, and handed Bauer a [[saliva]]-coated pen, hoping to pass the virus on to Bauer and his supporters. (Later he said much of his article had been fictitious). He also registered and participated in the caucus, which was illegal, as Savage was not an Iowa resident. He was charged and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of fraudulent voting in a caucus, and was sentenced to a year's [[probation]], 50 hours of community service, and a $750 fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmregister.com/news/stories/c4789004/12880264.html ''Des Moines Register'' article].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://qrd.org/qrd/media/radio/thiswayout/summary/newswrap/2000/N659-11.13.00 NewsWrap for the week ending November 11, 2000], ''This Way Out'' program #659, November 13, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, [http://thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=3092 Germ Warfare], ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'', January 27 – February 2, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Savage frequently mentions political issues in his column, particularly issues that affect family planning, birth control, and sexuality. He often encourages readers to get involved and/or voice a positive or negative opinion about a politician or public official.

====Campaign for the neologism "santorum"====
After [[Rick Santorum]], then a U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania, made comments in 2003 to a reporter comparing homosexual sex to [[bestiality]] and [[incest]], Savage assailed Santorum in his column. Later, he sponsored a contest that led to the term ''[[campaign for the neologism "santorum"|santorum]]'' being used to refer to "the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes a byproduct of anal sex".&lt;ref&gt;uma, [http://la.indymedia.org/news/2003/12/97071_comment.php Anal Sex Byproduct Named for Senator Santorum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102182528/http://la.indymedia.org/news/2003/12/97071_comment.php |date=November 2, 2006 }}, Indymedia.org, December 11, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Campaign for the neologism santorum]].)

In 2009 Savage invited his readers to vote to define ''[[saddlebacking]]'' as "the phenomenon of Christian teens engaging in unprotected anal sex to preserve their virginities."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saddlebacking.com "Saddlebacking"]. ''saddlebacking.com''.

When Savage vowed to boycott [[Utah]] due to strong [[Mormon]] support for Proposition 8 ("Fuck you, Utah—we’re going to big, blue Colorado"), the ''[[Salt Lake City Weekly]]'' dropped Savage's column: "all Utahns aren’t to blame."&lt;ref&gt;Edroso, Roy (2008) "[http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2008/11/salt_lake_weekl.php Salt Lake Weekly Fires Dan Savage for Utah Boycott; Voice Protests] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923152521/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2008/11/salt_lake_weekl.php |date=September 23, 2012 }}."

Savage strongly supported the [[War in Iraq]] in October 2002, stating "Free your people, reform your societies, liberalize, and democratize... or we're going to come over there, remove you from power, free your people, and reform your societies for ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=12237 Say "YES" to War on Iraq], ''The Stranger'', October 17–23, 2002.

Savage has also opposed state legislation proscribing the sale of [[sex toys]]. After an exposé by Kandiss Crone from [[WLBT]] 
in [[Jackson, Mississippi]] precipitated the arrest and fining of an adult video store owner, Savage suggested that readers send any sex toys that they needed to dispose of to Crone.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, [https://archive.is/20070517095307/http://www.ocweekly.com/columns/savage-love/savage-love-what-is-good-sex-toy-etiquette/28468/ "What is good sex-toy etiquette?"], February 14, 2008.

===Local issues===
Savage's editorship of ''The Stranger'' has established him as a voice in local Seattle politics. His most high-profile commentary has been as an outspoken critic of the [[Teen Dance Ordinance]] and other crackdowns on all-ages events.

Savage argues that closing down supervised all-ages dance venues drives teens to boredom and reckless activities: "Places like Ground Zero and the [[Kirkland Teen Union Building|Kirkland Teen Center]] are invaluable from a law enforcement point of view. They keep kids out of, say, 7-Eleven parking lots or the homes of friends whose parents are away."&lt;ref&gt;Josh Feit and Dan Savage, "[http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=31362 Raving Mad]", ''The Stranger'', March 30 – April 5, 2006.

===Other opinions===
[[File:2010 November 13 Dan Savage and Bill Savage.jpg|thumb|Dan Savage discussing [[sex education]] with his brother, Bill Savage, [[Northwestern University]] Senior Lecturer in English (2010)]]
Savage initially supported the [[Iraq War]] and advocated military action against other Middle Eastern states, including [[Iran]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], saying, "Islamo-fascism is a regional problem, like European fascism—and the Middle East [has] to be remade just as Europe was remade." One week before the war began, Savage spoke against it, citing the inability of President [[George W. Bush]] to form a convincing case and sway the UN and [[NATO]] allies.&lt;ref name="Against the War--For Now"/&gt; By 2005 he deemed the situation "hopeless" and advocated an immediate troop withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Dan (August 18, 2005). [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=22626 "It's over, over there"]. ''The Stranger''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Savage describes his view toward family as "conservative." His husband, Terry Miller, is a "stay-at-home dad" for the couple's [[LGBT adoption in the United States|adopted]] son. He has, however, expressed skepticism of "simplistic" views of [[monogamy]].&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Dan (September 23, 1999).

Savage stated in a column that he favors [[outing]] in some cases, specifically mentioning anti-gay activist Tyler Whitney. However, in the same column he noted that "I recently talked someone ''out'' of outing a public figure. A ''Savage Love'' reader was contemplating outing an innocuous celebrity back in April. I advised him against it because, as I wrote to him privately, outing is brutal and it should be reserved for brutes."&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, [http://www.avclub.com/content/node/62996 Savage Love] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626042106/http://www.avclub.com/content/node/62996 |date=June 26, 2007 }} (column), ''The A.V.

On the topic of child sexuality, Savage has said:
{{quote|We live in a culture that's hysterical about children and assumes they have no sexual agency or desire.

So [[NAMBLA]] steps out to articulate all this, albeit in its usual highly dysfunctional and creepy way, and because we know what they say to be true on this issue, we've got to label them as insane perverts.

Savage apologized on April 29 for calling the walkout "a pansy-assed move", saying, "I wasn't calling the handful of students who left pansies (2,800+ students, most of them Christian, stayed and listened), just the walkout itself." Savage stood by the central point of his speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/30/columnist-dan-savage-stands-by-comments-on-bullst-in-the-bible/?hpt=hp_c2|title=Columnist Dan Savage stands by comments on 'bulls**t in the Bible'|last=Gilgoff|first=Dan|date=April 30, 2012|publisher=CNN|accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/04/30/11477048-dan-savage-apologizes-for-criticizing-students-who-walked-out-of-lecture?lite |title=Dan Savage apologizes for criticizing students who walked out of lecture |first=Isolde |last=Raftery |work=[[msnbc.com]] |date=April 30, 2012 |accessdate=May 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504100543/http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/04/30/11477048-dan-savage-apologizes-for-criticizing-students-who-walked-out-of-lecture?lite |archivedate=May 4, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= On "Bullshit" and "Pansy-Assed" |first= Dan |last= Savage |date= April 29, 2012 |newspaper= [[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]] |url= http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2012/04/29/on-bullshit-and-pansy-assed |accessdate= May 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Bryan Lowder of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' stated that Savage "often takes heat for his less-than-refined statements on issues like the existence of male bisexuality, the responsibility of asexuals to 'come out' before dating, and, indeed, certain issues surrounding transgenderism."&lt;ref name="Lowder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2011/11/04/did_dan_savage_deserve_to_be_glitter_bombed_.html|title=Did Dan Savage Deserve to be Glitter-Bombed?|last=Lowder|first=J. Bryan|date=November 4, 2011|publisher=Slate|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage has repeatedly been the focus of controversy for his use of slurs regarding the transgender community, other remarks regarding trans issues, and for joking that the then Attorney General of Washington was trans (who was not, in fact, trans).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/02/dan-savage-glitterbombed-oregon-transphobia-_n_1071627.html "Dan Savage Gets Glitterbombed, Called Transphobic At University Of Oregon"].

He objected to a student's request that he use the phrase "T-slur" instead, and gave examples of other slurs. Some students criticized him, claiming that he tried to make the student feel threatened and uncomfortable. A University representative said, "A guest used language that provoked a spirited debate. The speaker was discussing how hurtful words can be repurposed and used to empower; at no point did he direct any slurs at anyone."&lt;ref&gt;

{{Main|Dan Savage bibliography}}
In addition to his advice column, Savage has written four books, edited one book, and authored various [[op-ed]] pieces in ''[[The New York Times]]''.

Savage coordinates the annual [[HUMP! (film festival)|Hump!]] film festival, which is made up of clips of up to five minutes on any pornographic topic, submitted by viewers. Winning submissions are shown in Seattle and Portland theaters, providing an unusual experience as straight, gay male, bi, lesbian, and fetish porn are all shown together, one after another. Savage publicly destroys the submissions after the festival is over.&lt;ref name="phil_DanS"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Dan Savage Bringing Amateur Porn Film Festival to Philly in February | last = Middleton | first = Josh | work = Philadelphia Magazine | date = January 20, 2015 | accessdate = March 6, 2015 | url = http://www.phillymag.com/g-philly/2015/01/20/dan-savage-bringing-amateur-porn-film-fest-philly-february/ | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For twenty-five years, Epstein has been the primary [[BarBri]] lecturer on the topic of [[contract]]s,&lt;ref name="SMU"/&gt; and his lectures have thus been viewed by upwards of a million students.

===PEN controversy===

In April 2015, in an exchange with American PEN’s Executive Director [[Suzanne Nossel]] published in ''[[The Intercept]]'' by [[Glenn Greenwald]],&lt;ref name="firstlook.org"&gt;{{cite web | website = [[The Intercept]] | last = Greenwald | first = Glenn | authorlink = Glenn Greenwald | date = April 27, 2015 | title = Read the Letters and Comments of PEN Writers Protesting the Charlie Hebdo Award | url = https://theintercept.com/2015/04/27/read-letters-comments-pen-writers-protesting-charlie-hebdo-award/ | accessdate = January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenberg criticized PEN’s decision to bestow its annual Freedom of Expression Courage Award to ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' instead of to "Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras."&lt;ref name="firstlook.org"/&gt; Writers [[Michael C. Moynihan|Michael Moynihan]], [[Ophelia Benson]] and [[Katha Pollitt]] criticized her for comparing ''Charlie Hebdo'' to the Nazi publication ''Der Stürmer''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Michael | last = Moynihan | authorlink = Michael C.

Joining Eisenberg in her protest of PEN’s award ceremony were [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]], [[Francine Prose]], [[Teju Cole]], [[Rachel Kushner]] and [[Taiye Selasi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = [[The New York Times]] | first = Jennifer | last = Schuessler | date = April 26, 2015 | title = Six PEN Members Decline Gala After Award for Charlie Hedbo | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/27/nyregion/six-pen-members-decline-gala-after-award-for-charlie-hebdo.html | accessdate = March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 145 writers—including [[Junot Diaz]], [[Lorrie Moore]], [[Joyce Carol Oates]] and [[Michael Cunningham]]—signed a letter protesting PEN’s decision. While calling the murders in the Charlie Hedbo offices "sickening and tragic," the letter goes on to say, "PEN is not simply conveying support for freedom of expression but also valorizing selectively offensive material: material that intensifies the anti-Islamic, anti-Maghreb, anti-Arab sentiments already prevalent in the Western world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = [[The New York Times]] | first = Jennifer | last = Schuessler | date = April 30, 2015 | title = 145 Writers Sign Letter Protesting PEN Award to Charlie Hedbo | url = https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/145-writers-sign-letter-protesting-pen-award-to-charlie-hebdo/ | accessdate = March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4561">'''Diamond school''', diamond model, diamond shape and diamond structure are similar terms that apply to a type of [[independent school]] in the UK that combines both single-sex and [[coeducational]] teaching in the same organisation. Typically, the establishment will be [[all-through school|all-through]], often with a nursery setting, and boys and girls are taught together until the age of 11, separately from 11-16, before coming back together again in a joint [[sixth form]].

Diamond schools are often the product of the merger of a boys' and a girls' school, thus it is possible that at [[Key Stage 3|KS3]] and [[Key Stage 4|KS4]] girls and boys can be taught separately on different sites. It is a common feature that boys and girls combine outside the classroom in activities for academic trips and visits and in some co-curricular activities, such as choirs, orchestras and the [[Duke of Edinburgh Award]] scheme. Other coeducational schools adopt a "partial" diamond model in which certain subjects (e.g. [[Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics|STEM]] are taught to gender segregated sets or classes, typically drawn from Key Stages 3 and 4 (Years 7 to 11).

The degree of gender separation has recently been brought into focus by the [[Al-Hijrah School|Al Hijrah]] judicial decision that total gender segregation in coeducational schools is illegal in England and Wales.

Diamond schools in the UK independent sector include:

*[[Leweston School]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leweston.co.uk Leweston School]&lt;/ref&gt;, previously a single-sex girls' school, announced during 2017 that it would move towards a diamond structure&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leweston.co.uk/why-leweston/diamond-model-school/&lt;/ref&gt; for the delivery of STEM subjects in Year 9 to 11 whilst moving to become coeducational during a four year transitional period from 2018 to 2021.
Schools that have abandoned a diamond shape:
*[[Teesside High School]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.teessidehigh.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; adopted the diamond model in 2005 but became fully coeducational in 2015.

As the recipient of a fellowship in 2003-4, awarded by the peak educational body, the American Council on Education (ACE), Bell also worked closely with the senior administration of [[Virginia Tech]] as they revised their curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Clara B.|title=Virginia Tech Hosts One Of Nation's 37 ACE Fellows|url=https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/20596/2003-285.html?sequence=1|website=vetchworks.lib.vt.edu|publisher=Virginia Tech University|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell served on the Board of Trustees for [[Hampshire College]] for eight years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diane|first1=Bell|title=Trustee Emeriti|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/offices/trustees-emeriti|website=Hampshire College|publisher=Hampshire College|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On her retirement from GWU in 2005 she was awarded the title "Professor Emerita of Anthropology" by The George Washington University. On her return to Australia she was appointed Writer and Editor in Residence at Flinders University (South Australia) and Visiting Professor, School of Social Sciences at the University of Adelaide (South Australia).

Bell is the author/editor of 10 books, including several significant monographs on Australian Aboriginal culture and numerous articles and book chapters dealing with religion, land rights, law reform, art, history and social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/biogs/P004459b.htm|title=Bell, Diane - Biographical entry - Encyclopedia of Australian Science|first=The University of Melbourne eScholarship Research|last=Centre|website=www.asap.unimelb.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has served on the editorial boards of several journals (''Aboriginal History'' 1979–1988; ''[[Women's Studies International Forum]]'' 1990-) and was a contributing member of the Editorial Board for the ''Longmans Encyclopedia'' (1989) Macmillan, ''Encyclopedia of World Religions'' (2005) and the ''Encyclopedia of Religion in Australia'' (2009).

Bell was a contributing consultant to ''National Geographic'' on their ''Taboo'' TV series (2002-4).

==Anthropological work==
{{More citations needed|date=March 2018}}
Bell's first full-length anthropological monograph was ''Daughters of the Dreaming'', which focused on the religious, spiritual and ceremonial lives of Aboriginal women in central Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowdler|first1=Sarah|title=Review of Daughters of the Dreaming by D. Bell.|journal=Australian Archaeology|date=1984|issue=19|pages=116–117|url=https://www.library.uq.edu.au/ojs/index.php/aa/article/view/1755/1737 |accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been in continuous print since its first publication in 1983 and subsequent editions in 1993 and 2002 engage with the debates the work stimulated. It is now well-established practice to have women's councils as part of the decision-making and consultative structures in Aboriginal affairs. Through her research and in giving expert evidence, Bell has been able to demonstrate that Aboriginal women are owners and managers of land in their own right. Bell worked on some 10 land claims for the Central Land Council, the Northern Land Council and the then Aboriginal Land Commissioner, Mr Justice Toohey.

In 1986, Melbourne publishers McPhee Gribble, with Bell as author, won the competitive tender from the Australian Bicentennial Authority (ABA) to write a book about women in Australia for the 1988 Bicentenary. The book, ''Generations: Grandmothers, Mothers and Daughters'' (with photos by Ponch Hawkes) explored generations of Australian women and "the way the significant objects in their lives have been passed from hand to hand, generation to generation".&lt;ref&gt;from the back page blurb of the Penguin edition of ''Generations''&lt;/ref&gt; It focused on ordinary people through the stories they had been told by and were passing onto their female kin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article101972973 |title=Bicentenary books enshrine Australian women's arts. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=30 January 1988 |accessdate=1 January 2015 |page=13 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell used an ethnographic approach to explore the commonalities of Australian women's cultures across age, time, race and region. Shortly after it was published, the book reached number one on the ''Age'' best seller list for works of non-fiction.

Throughout the latter part of the 1970s, and through most of the 1980s, Bell was involved in issues about Aboriginal land rights and law reform. With lawyer, Pam Ditton, she authored ''Law: the old and the new. Aboriginal Women in Central Australia Speak Out'' (Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service, 1980) which addressed issues of law reform in Central Australia, in the wake of the passage of the Northern Territory Land Rights Act (1976). Bell worked on a number of land claim cases in the Northern Territory, particularly in central Australia, but also in and around the [[Top End]].

In the late 1990s, Bell became a key player in the [[Hindmarsh Island bridge controversy]]. In 1994 a group of [[Ngarrindjeri]] women, traditional owners of the Lower River Murray, Lakes Alexandrina and Albert and the Coorong (South Australia) had objected that a proposal to build a bridge from Goolwa to Kumarangk (Hindmarsh Island) near the Murray Mouth would desecrate sites sacred to them as women. The gender restricted knowledge that underwrote their claim became known as 'secret women's business' and was contested in the media, courts and academy. In 1996 a South Australian Royal Commission found that the women had deliberately fabricated their beliefs to thwart the development. However, the women who claimed knowledge of the sacred tradition did not give evidence at the Royal Commission because they considered it to be a violation of their religious freedoms. Five years later these women and those experts who had testified on their behalf were vindicated. In 2001, federal court judge, Mr John von Doussa, heard from all parties to the dispute and found the women had not lied. Nonetheless the notion that the women lied persists in some quarters and 'secret women's business' is used as a term of derision and disrespect. Bell became involved in this matter of gender-restricted knowledge after the Royal Commission. On the basis of her research in the SA archives and fieldwork with the women in 1996-8, Bell was convinced there was sufficient evidence to support the women's claims that there was gender-restricted knowledge in Ngarrindjeri society and that the women had told the truth.

Bell's subsequent monograph, ''Ngarrindjeri Wurruwarrin'' (1998), won the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Gleebooks Prize for Critical Writing|NSW Premier's Gleebook Award]] for cultural and literary criticism in 1999. The judges wrote: "An erudite capacious book on the politically contentious and culturally sensitive subject of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair, in which the author allows diverse voices to be heard and refuses to simplify an inherently complicated and pressing set of issues. This is an outstanding book of cultural criticism, which brings together feminist anthropology, oral and archival history, political and legal narrative." The book was also short listed for The Age Book of the Year and the Queensland Premier's History Award in 1999 and the Gold Medal of the Australian Literary Society in 2000. ''Ngarrindjeri Wurruwarrin'' is often cited as an important example of alternate ethnographic prose. Bell's most recent writing with Ngarrindjeri women, ''Kungun Ngarrindjeri Miminar Yunnan'' (2008) is a further contribution to collaborative research and writing and documents the impact of the contesting of cultural knowledge on the Ngarrindjeri. Bell continued to work with the Ngarrindjeri and from 2005–2012 lives on their traditional lands as she researched and wrote the Connection Report for their Native Title Claim.

Bell has also delved into the writing of fiction and plays. Her first book, titled ''Evil'', addresses secrets within the churches and is set on the campus of an American college.  Performed as a play adapted by Leslie Jacobson for the "From Page to Stage" season on new plays at the Kennedy Center, Washington, D.C., USA, 3 September 2006 and presented as a staged reading in Adelaide, 16 May 2008. Her play "Weaving and Whispers" was performed at the TarraWarra Museum of Arts Biennial in 2014. Her short story "Blenders" appeared in ''Island'' magazine 2010.

== Politics ==
Bell ran as an [[independent (politics)|independent]] candidate in the [[Mayo by-election, 2008|2008 Mayo by-election]], caused by the resignation of former foreign minister and [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] leader [[Alexander Downer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24165734-5013871,00.html|title=Anthropologist and author Diane Bell throws hat into Mayo ring: The Australian 12/8/2008|website=news.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her campaign was called Vote4Di and was supported by a campaign website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vote4di.com/index.html|archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/88408/20080904-1524/vote4di.com/index.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 September 2008|title=G'day, Di here|author=Di Bell|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Australian independent Senator [[Nick Xenophon]] gave support to Bell's campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24215631-5006787,00.html|title=Xenophon backs Bell for Mayo by-election: The Australian 21/8/2008|website=news.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24235117-5013871,00.html|title=Mayo candidates jockey for votes as saviours of the Murray: The Australian 25/8/2008|website=news.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a field of eleven candidates and the absence of a [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] candidate, Bell finished third on a 16.3 percent primary vote, behind the [[Australian Greens|Greens]] on 21.4 (+10.4) percent and the Liberals on 41.3 (–9.8) percent.

'''Distance Education Centre Victoria''' ('''DECV''') is a school located in [[Thornbury, Victoria|Thornbury]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], in [[Melbourne]]'s north. It aims to provide flexible learning opportunities to Victorian F-12 students who are unable to attend mainstream schooling. 

==Students==
The DECV exists to meet the educational needs of Victorian students whose circumstances prevent them from accessing mainstream schooling. In order to directly enrol with the DECV students must fall under one of five enrolment categories and provide certain pieces of documented evidence alongside their application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DECV Eligibility Criteria|url=http://www.distance.vic.edu.au/eligibility-criteria/|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Category 1 – medical:'' students enrolling in this category must have a specialist diagnosis of a chronic medical condition or treatment for a condition which means they are not physically able to attend a mainstream school for an extended period of time.

''Category 2 – travel:'' students enrolling in this category must be Victorian residents who are unable to attend a mainstream school because they are travelling within Victoria, Australia or overseas. Travel may be required due to a parent’s work commitments or an extended family holiday.

''Category 3 – sports and performance:'' students enrolling in this category must have elite sporting or performing arts commitments which prevent them from being able to attend mainstream school. These commitments may include performance or training commitments during regular school times, or extended interstate or international travel for training or competition. Many children wanting to ‘dance’ like become a ballerina or ballet dancer use this program so they can do half time or full day at their dance school.

''Category 4 – distance:'' students enrolling in this category must be Victorian residents who live in a remote area where it is not feasible to travel to a local mainstream government school. The requirements for enrolment in this category vary depending on the Year Level and age of the student.

''Category 5 – young adults:'' students aged at least 17 years of age at the beginning of the semester they wish to commence in, and less than 21 years on 1 January that year, may enrol to study a VCE or VCAL course of study with the DECV.

==The school==
The school is based in Thornbury, Victoria. It shares a building with the ''Victorian School of Languages''. 

The school is split into two sub-schools:
*''F-10 sub-school'', which handles students from Foundation to Year 10;
*''Year 11/12 sub-school'', which handles students from Years 11 and 12 (including VCE and VCAL).

==Work==
A [[blended learning]] model is employed by the school in the vast majority of subjects, with work completed in online classroom spaces, both synchronous and asynchronous, and physical unit guides. Students are also able to visit the school during normal school hours to meet with teachers, attend seminars and study in the library or purpose built study areas.

'''Charles-Henri Edmond Duvernoy''' (16 June 1844{{spaced ndash}}12 January 1927) was a French pianist, [[baritone]] and vocal teacher, from a family of musicians.&lt;ref name="Fetis"&gt;Fétis F-J. ''Biographie universelle des musiciens.'' Paris, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
Edmond Duvernoy was born in [[Paris]].  He was taught initially by his father, Charles-François Duvernoy, then studied at the [[Paris Conservatoire]]. A fine pianist, he began to teach, then studied singing, joining the [[Opéra-Comique]] company.&lt;ref name="Fetis"/&gt; He made his stage debut as Mercutio in the first performance at the Opéra-Comique of [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]]'s ''[[Roméo et Juliette]]'' on 20 January 1873. He also sang Moralès in the premiere of [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'' in 1875; Bizet composed three versions of the ''mélodrame'' in Act 1 for Duvernoy.

According to Malherbe, he had a relatively soft voice, but he used it with good taste, and with sufficient talent to enable him to become later one of the most esteemed vocal teachers.&lt;ref name="Soubies"&gt;Soubies A, Malherbe C. ''Histoire de l'opéra comique — La seconde salle Favart 1840–1887.'' Flammarion, Paris, 1893.&lt;/ref&gt;

He sang Ganymède in ''Galathée'' in 1873, alongside his future wife, Mlle Franck, a soprano of the Opéra-Comique.&lt;ref name="Soubies"/&gt; Duvernoy and his wife moved to the Théâtre-Lyrique in 1877. Both of them participated in the private 'premiere' of Offenbach’s ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann|Les contes d'Hoffmann]]'' on 18 May 1879, Duvernoy playing the piano.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, Stéphane. ''Un demi-siècle d'Opéra-Comique 1900–1950.'' André Bonne, Paris, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

From October 1887 to 1910 Duvernoy was a singing professor at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]], with many important artists among his pupils including [[Aino Ackté]]. He also composed some songs.

He died in Paris in 1927, aged 82.  His brother was [[Alphonse Duvernoy]], pianist and composer.

'''Elvavrålet''' (Swedish: the eleven roar) is a [[student]] [[tradition]] where students at universities and colleges at a certain time every evening/night in student residential areas (22:00 or 23:00, on Lappkärrsberget only Tuesdays) open their windows, go out onto balconies or up to the rooftops and scream out their [[anxiety]] due to exams and [[stress (psychological)|stress]].

The roar is also called ''the Delphi roar'' (after the student residential area Delphi in [[Lund]]), ''the Flogsta roar''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfi.se/sv/svensk-filmdatabas/Item/?type=MOVIE&amp;itemid=73915 ''Flogstavrålet''] (2013) på [[Svensk Filmdatabas]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unt.se/student/flogstavralet-aterupptackt-tradition-360307.aspx ''Flogstavrålet återupptäckt tradition''],  [[Upsala Nya Tidning]], 2 mars 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (after the neighborhood [[Flogsta]] in [[Uppsala]]), ''the Lappkärr cry'' (after the neighborhood Lappkärrsberget in [[Stockholm]]), ''the Ten cry'', ''the Tuesday scream'' or ''Anxiety scream''. On some days there are more roars than others, and sometimes even [[vuvuzela]]s are used. The phenomenon has been known since the 1970s, and has also been the subject of academic papers and discussions on the radio.

'''Eugen Steimle''' (8 December 1909 – 9 October 1987) was a German [[SS]] commander in the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD) during the [[Nazi era]].  He commanded ''Sonderkommando'' 7a and ''Einsatzkommando'' 4a of the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', both of which were responsible for mass killings in the Soviet Union. Steimle was found guilty in 1947 in the [[Einsatzgruppen Trial]] and sentenced to death in 1948.  His sentence was commuted to 20 years in prison.

==SS career==
Steimle was the son of a [[pastor]] and came from a strict pietistic family and studied history, German and French at the [[University of Tübingen]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]].  In May 1935, he passed his teaching exams.  He joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1932 and the [[National Socialist German Students' League]] (NSDStB), where he devoted himself to teaching ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'' students of the [[Sudetenland]].  He joined the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] (no. 272,575) as well in 1932, and then joined the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] in 1935 at the instigation of NSDStB chief [[Gustav Adolf Scheel]].&lt;ref&gt;Christian Ingrao ''Croire et détruire : les intellectuels dans la machine de guerre SS'' ed. Fayard 2010 p. 133 {{ISBN|978-2-286-06980-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1936, Steimle directed the SD office in Stuttgart.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Ingrao op.cit. p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;  First, he headed the SD subsection Württemberg, and from 1939 until 1943, the SD-Leitabschnitt Stuttgart.&lt;ref&gt;''Die Verfolgung und Ermordung der europäischen Juden durch das nationalsozialistische Deutschland 1933–1945'' (collection of sources), Vol. 3: ''Deutsches Reich und Protektorat September 1939 – September 1941'' (ed. Andrea Löw), München 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-486-58524-7}}, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

From 7 September to 10 December 1941, he succeeded [[Walter Blume (SS officer)|Walter Blume]] as the commanding officer of ''Sonderkommando'' 7a in [[Einsatzgruppe B|''Einsatzgruppe'' B]], which was led by [[Arthur Nebe]].  Under Steimle's command, his unit murdered 500 Jews within two months.  From August 1942 to January 1943, he replaced Erwin Weinmann as leader of ''Einsatzkommando'' 4a in [[Einsatzgruppe C|''Einsatzgruppe'' C]], which was led by [[Otto Rasch]].&lt;ref&gt;Christian Ingrao op. cit. p. 367&lt;/ref&gt;  After returning to Germany, he became head of Group VI B (German-Italian sphere of influence in Europe, Africa and the Middle East) in the [[SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt|RSHA]].  In 1944, he was promoted to ''SS-[[Standartenführer]]''.

==Trial and conviction==
Steimle was arrested by the Allies in 1945.  He was found guilty in 1947 in the [[Einsatzgruppen Trial]] and sentenced to death in 1948.  His sentence was commuted to 20 years in prison based upon recommendations of the "[[Peck Panel]]".  He was released from [[Landsberg Prison]] in June 1954 and then taught German and history in [[Wilhelmsdorf, Baden-Württemberg]].  He retired in 1975.&lt;ref name="Klee599"&gt;Ernst Klee: ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich'', Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 599&lt;/ref&gt;  Eugen Steimle died on 9 October 1987.&lt;ref name="trans"&gt;''This article incorporates information from the [[:fr:Eugen Steimle|corresponding article]] in the [[French Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Sir [[James George Frazer]] Memorial Lectureship in [[Social Anthropology]]''' is a British academic lecture series.

In 1920 a sum of £675 was raised by a Committee of the University of Cambridge for the purpose of commemorating Sir James Frazer’s contributions to learning. In accordance with the wishes of the subscribers, a Frazer Lectureship in Anthropology was founded, the annual income of the fund being assigned to the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge]], [[University of Glasgow]] and [[University of Liverpool]] in rotation for this purpose.

'''Freda Betti''' (26 February 1924 – 13 November 1979), whose birth name was '''Frédérique Thérèse Augusta Betti''', was a French [[mezzo-soprano]] singer whose career was mainly confined to France.&lt;ref name="centraloperabull"&gt;[http://www.cpanda.org/pdfs/csob/2301.pdf ''Central Opera Service bulletin'', Volume 23, No. 1].

== Biography ==
Freda Betti was born at 52 rue des Ponchettes in the district of ''Vieux-Nice'' in a modest family : her father was a house painter and her mother a fishmonger. His paternal family originates from the region of [[Emilia-Romagna]] in [[Italy]] : his grandfather was born in [[Parma]] and he immigrated to [[Nice]] with his wife and children in 1893.&lt;ref name="Germannationallibrary"&gt;[http://viaf.org/processed/DNB%7C129638838 Years of birth and death in the German National Library] accessed 27 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

She studied music and especially singing at the [[Conservatory of Nice]] with Édouard Rouard,&lt;ref name="shortoperaobit"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=2NfQUKauFYaGhQef84CgBQ&amp;hl=en&amp;id=5y4KAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22freda+betti%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22freda+betti%22 Obituary for Freda Betti in ''[[Opera (magazine)|Opera]]'', Vol 31, p299, 1980.] accessed 27 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; where she obtained a ''Premier Prix de Chant'' in 1943. She made her debut at the [[Opéra de Monte-Carlo]] in 1947 as Siébel in ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' by [[Charles Gounod]].&lt;ref name="shortoperaobit"/&gt; She appeared frequently with the [[Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France]] of the [[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française|RTF]] in the early 1950s, before entering the troupe of the [[Opéra-Comique]] in the 1960s. She sang the title role in particular of ''[[Carmen]]'' by [[Georges Bizet]] which she sang more than 150 times, and her repertoire also included Fricka, Brangaene, Dulcinée in ''[[Don Quichotte]]'' and Suzuki.&lt;ref name="shortoperaobit"/&gt;

Betti sang on major national stages&lt;ref name="centraloperabull"/&gt; ([[Théâtre Graslin|Nantes]], [[Opéra de Nice|Nice]], [[Strasbourg Music Festival|Strasbourg]], [[Théâtre du Capitole|Toulouse]]) and European ([[Opéra de Monte-Carlo|Monte-Carlo]], [[La Scala]]), as well as in numerous opera festivals, including [[Aix-en-Provence Festival|Aix-en-Provence]], [[Festival d'Avignon|Avignon]], [[Bayreuth Festival|Bayreuth]].

Betti recorded for [[Philips Records|Philips]] and [[EMI Records|EMI]].&lt;ref name="shortoperaobit" /&gt; Among published recordings she took part in were ''[[Snegurochka (opera)|The Snow Maiden]]'' (Bobilicka),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operadis-opera-discography.org.uk/CLRISNOW.HTM Listing of 1955 radio recording of ''The Snow Maiden'' conducted by [[Charles Bruck]] at the Operadiscography site] accessed 27 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Démophon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/Johann-Christoph-Vogel-Demophon/release/4681246 Listing of 1957 studio recording of ''Démophon'' by Johann-Christoph Vogel conducted by [[Georges Tzipine]]] accessed 27 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Tosca]]'' (shepherd boy)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operadis-opera-discography.org.uk/CLPUTOSC.HTM Listing of 1960 studio recording of ''Tosca'' conducted by [[Manuel Rosenthal]] at the Operadiscography site] accessed 27 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Philippine'' (Isabelle).&lt;ref&gt;[http://194.254.96.55/cm/?for=docum&amp;cledocum=philippine_ortf_1963 L'encyclopédie multimedia de la comédie musicale théâtrale en France (1918-1944), Delannoy's Philippine] accessed 27 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 she recorded excerpts from ''Carmen'' with [[Ken Neate]], [[Gabriel Bacquier]] and [[Andréa Guiot]] on Philips P 77118 L.

{{Governance}}
'''Good governance''' is an indeterminate term used in the [[international development]] literature to describe how public institutions conduct public affairs and manage public resources. [[Governance]] is "the process of decision-making and the process by which decisions are implemented (or not implemented)".&lt;ref name ="UNESCAP"&gt;[http://www.unescap.org/pdd/prs/ProjectActivities/Ongoing/gg/governance.asp "What is Good Governance"]. [[UNESCAP]], 2009. Accessed July 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''governance'' can apply to corporate, international, national, local governance&lt;ref name = "UNESCAP"/&gt; or to the interactions between other sectors of society.

The concept of "good governance" of ten emerges as a model to compare ineffective economies or political bodies with viable economies and political bodies.&lt;ref name =Khan16/&gt; The concept centers on the responsibility of governments and governing bodies to meet the needs of the masses as opposed to select groups in society. Because countries often described as "most successful" are Western [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic states]], concentrated in Europe and the Americas, good governance standards often measure other state institutions against these states.&lt;ref name =Khan16&gt;Khan 16&lt;/ref&gt; Aid organizations and the authorities of developed countries often will focus the meaning of "good governance" to a set of requirements that conform to the organization's agenda, making "good governance" imply many different things in many different contexts.&lt;ref name = Agere1/&gt;&lt;ref name = Agere4/&gt;&lt;ref name = Poluha/&gt;

==Distinction from other related concepts==

It is important to distinguish good governance from other concepts that look similar, such as development and economic growth. Instead of considering them as equal, many scholars refer to them as features that are likely to be related in different ways. In fact, the importance that authors give to good governance, is due to the impact it may have on development and economic growth.

According to Grindle (2004),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the relevance of getting good governance comes precisely from its relationship with the development of a country and the reduction of poverty. Setting an agenda for reaching good governance is of the huge interest but also a complex task, which makes this author to propose rather a “good enough governance” agenda as a starting point. In the construction of this "simpler" agenda, the idea is to revisit policies that have worked in the past, set priorities in a strategically way, consider policies with greater impact in alleviating poverty and reaching development, and look for innovative ways of implementing such policies.

In terms of economic growth, there are several authors relating that variable with good governance, but in the sense of “being related to” instead of “being part of”. In other words, scholars have been intrigued by the relationship between good governance and economic or political development. Grindle (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grindle|first=Merilee|date=2007|title=Good Enough Governance Revisited|url=|journal=Development Policy Review|volume=25 | issue = 5 |pages=533–74|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7679.2007.00385.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; mentions there are many relations to be found between indicators of good governance and economic growth, however those associations are difficult to measure and even harder to be attributed as causal. Nevertheless, she mentions the work of Kauffman (2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufmann|first=Daniel|last2=Kraay|first2=Aart|date=November 2002|title=Growth Without Governance|url=|journal=Policy Research Working Paper, The World Bank, World Bank Institute and Development Research Group|volume=No. 2928|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who found a causal and positive relationship between different dimensions of good governance and the GDP per capita in the long run, i.e. good governance makes development possible.

These dimensions are how the government is elected and oversighted, the accountability power of citizens, the credibility in the government, the respect for institutions, both from government and citizens, and the effective delivery of public goods. He found that the relation between these two variables does not hold in the reverse direction, meaning that higher levels of economic growth do not lead to better governance.  For example, Quain (2003) points out that China and Vietnam are frequent examples of countries that have made remarkable leaps in economic development and poverty reduction, but nevertheless retain many characteristics of poor governance.

==In international affairs (IR)==

In international affairs, analysis of good governance can look at any of the following relationships:&lt;ref name="Agere1"&gt;Agere 1&lt;/ref&gt;

* between governments and markets
* between governments and citizens
* between governments and the private or voluntary sector
* between elected officials and appointed officials
* between government and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs)

The varying types of comparisons comprising the analysis of governance in scholastic and practical discussion can cause the meaning of "good governance" to vary greatly from practitioner to practitioner.&lt;ref name = Agere1/&gt;

==In corporate sectors==

In corporate affairs, good governance can be observed in any of the following relationships:

* between governance and corporate management
* between governance and employee standards
* between governance and corruption in the workplace

The meaning of good governance in regards to corporate sectors varies between actors. Legislation has been enacted in an attempt to influence good governance in corporate affairs. In the United States, the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] of 2002 set up requirements for businesses to follow. [[Whistleblower|Whistleblowing]] has also been widely used by corporations to expose corruption and fraudulent activity.&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, Tim V., and Michael D. Akers. "Whistleblowing and Good Governance". ''CPA Journal'' 77, no. 6 (June 2007): 66-71. ''Business Source Complete'', EBSCO''host'' (accessed March 22, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In national governments==

Good governance in the context of countries is a broad term, and in that regards, it is difficult to find a unique definition. According to Fukuyama (2013),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fukuyama,|first=Francis|date=January 2013|title=What Is Governance?|url=|journal=Center for Global Development|volume=Working paper 314|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are two dimensions to qualify governance as good or bad: the capacity of the state and the bureaucracy's autonomy. They both complement, in the sense that when the state is more capable, for instance through the collection of taxes, there should be more autonomy because the bureaucrats are able to conduct things well without being instructed with a lot of details. In less capable states, however, less discretion and more rules setting are desirable.

Another way to think about good governance is through outcomes. Since governments carry out with goals like the provision of public goods to its citizens, there is no better way to think about good governance other than through deliverables, which are precisely the one demanded by citizens, like security, health, education, water, the enforcement of contracts, protection to property, protection to the environment and their ability to vote and get paid fair wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rotberg|first=Robert|date=July 2014|title=Good Governance Means Performance and Results|url=|journal=Governance: An International Journal of Policy, Administration, and Institutions|volume= 27| issue =  3|pages=511–518|doi=10.1111/gove.12084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, good governance might be approximated with provision of public services in an efficient manner, higher participation given to certain groups in the population like the poor and the minorities, the guarantee that citizens have the opportunity of checks and balances on the government, the establishment and enforcement of norms for the protection of the citizens and their property and the existence of independent judiciary systems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grindle|first=Merilee|date=October 2004|title=Good Enough Governance: Poverty Reduction and Reform in Developing Countries.|url=|journal=Governance: An International Journal of Policy, Administration, and Institutions|volume= 17| issue =  4|pages=525–48|doi=10.1111/j.0952-1895.2004.00256.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawson (2011)&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawson|first=Robert|date=2012|title=Book Review of Bo Rothstein: The quality of government: corruption, social trust, and inequality in international perspective.|url=|journal=Public Choice|volume=150|pages=793–795}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his review of Rothstein's book “The quality of government: corruption, social trust, and inequality in international perspective”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The quality of government: corruption, social trust, and inequality in international perspective|last=Rothstein|first=Bo|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Chicago, IL|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; mentions that the author relates good governance to the concept of impartiality, which is basically when the bureaucrats perform their tasks following the public interest rather than their self-interest. Lawson differs with him in that this impartial application of law ignores important factors like the economic liberalism, which matters due to its relation with economic growth.

==In local governments==
Good governance is argued to be the most important in local governments. It tries to promote more relationships between government and

* [[Empowerment|Empowered citizens]]
* Neighborhood councils
* Community councils

Good governance with local government aims to increase civil engagement with more members of the community in order to get the best options that serves the people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undp.org/content/dam/aplaws/publication/en/publications/democratic-governance/dg-publications-for-website/a-users-guide-to-measuring-local-governance-/LG%20Guide.pdf "A User's Guide to Measuring Local Governance"] UNDP&lt;/ref&gt;

==In scientific exploration==
Before there can be scientific experimentation, organizations must be compliant with good governance, meaning that testing must be moral and practical. Many research organizations such as [[Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering|SPICE]] (Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering), a geoengineering research project that was formed in the U.K., was required to go through stages of evaluation before testing could be conducted if they were to be funded by stakeholders. In 2011 SPICE made plans to experiment with solar radiation. The method for this experiment included injecting [[Stratospheric sulfate aerosols (geoengineering)|stratospheric sulfur aerosols]] into the Earth's atmosphere.

The criteria or "stage-gate" that they must pass before performing their experiment included the following; identify safe and principle risks, test must be compliant with relevant regulations, future applications and impacts, and mechanisms put in place to review these in the light of new information, and that the stakeholders must be regarded and taken into account. Before research can be conducted in the field of geoengineering it must be scrutinized using good governance to ensure testing isn't harmful to the environment and to detail all the possible risks that may occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macnaghten|first=Phil|last2=Owen|first2=Richard|date=2011-11-17|title=Environmental science: Good governance for geoengineering|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v479/n7373/full/479293a.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=479|issue=7373|pages=293–293|doi=10.1038/479293a|issn=0028-0836|pmid=22094673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reform and standards==
Three institutions can be reformed to promote good governance: the state, the [[private sector]] and civil society.&lt;ref name = Agere10/&gt; However, among different cultures, the need and demand for reform can vary depending on the priorities of that country's society.&lt;ref name = Agere11&gt;Agere 11&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of country level initiatives and international movements put emphasis on various types of governance reform. Each movement for reform establishes criteria for what they consider good governance based on their own needs and agendas. The following are examples of good governance  standards for prominent organizations in the international community.

===United Nations (UN)===
The [[United Nations]] is playing an increasing role in good governance. According to former UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], "Good governance is ensuring respect for human rights and the rule of law; strengthening democracy; promoting transparency and capacity in public administration." To implement this, the UN follows eight principles:&lt;ref name="UNESCAP" /&gt;

* Participation - People should be able to voice their own opinions through legitimate immediate organizations or representatives.
* Rule of Law - Legal framework should be enforced impartially, especially on human right laws.
* Consensus Oriented - Mediates differing interests to meet the broad consensus on the best interests of a community.
* Equity and Inclusiveness - People should have opportunities to improve or maintain their well-being. 
* Effectiveness and Efficiency - Processes and institutions should be able to produce results that meet the needs of their community while making the best of their resources.
* Accountability - Governmental institutions, private sectors, and civil society organizations should be held accountable to the public and institutional stakeholders.
* Transparency - Information should be accessible to the public and should be understandable and monitored.
* Responsiveness - Institutions and processes should serve all stakeholders.

===International Monetary Fund (IMF)===
{{See also|Structural adjustment}}

The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) was created at a United Nations (UN) conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. In 1996, the IMF declared "promoting good governance in all its aspects, including by ensuring the rule of law, improving the efficiency and accountability of the public sector, and tackling corruption, as essential elements of a framework within which economies can prosper".&lt;ref name = IMF&gt;{{cite web |publisher = International Monetary Fund | url = http://www.imf.org/external/np/gov/guide/eng/index.htm | title = The IMF's Approach to Promoting Good Governance and Combating Corruption — A Guide| date=June 20, 2005| accessdate = November 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMF feels that corruption within economies is caused by the ineffective governance of the economy, either too much regulation or too little regulation.&lt;ref name = IMF/&gt; To receive loans from the IMF, countries must have certain good governance policies, as determined by the IMF, in place.&lt;ref name =IMF/&gt;

===World Bank===
The [[World Bank]] is concerned with the reform of economic and social resource control.&lt;ref name = Agere3&gt;Agere 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, it underlined three aspects of society that they feel affect the nature of a country's governance:&lt;ref name = Agere3/&gt;

#type of political regime;
#process by which authority is exercised in the management of the economic and social resources, with a view to development; and
#capacity of governments to formulate policies and have them effectively implemented.

==Worldwide Governance Indicators==
{{main|Worldwide Governance Indicators}}
The Worldwide Governance Indicators is a program funded by the World Bank to measure the quality of governance of over 200 countries. It uses six dimensions of governance for their measurements, Voice &amp; Accountability, Political Stability and Lack of Violence, [[Government]] Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, [[Rule of law|Rule of Law]], and Control of [[political corruption|Corruption]]. They have been studying countries since 1996.&lt;ref name="Kaufman"&gt;Kaufmann, Daniel and Kraay, Aart, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=316861 "Growth Without Governance"] (November 2002). World Bank Policy Research Working Paper No. 2928.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

===International humanitarian funding===
Good governance defines an ideal that is difficult to achieve in full, though it is something development supporters consider donating to causes.&lt;ref name = Agere2&gt;Agere 2&lt;/ref&gt; Major donors and international financial institutions, like the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) or World Bank, are basing their [[foreign aid|aid]] and loans on the condition that the recipient undertake reforms ensuring good governance.&lt;ref name = "UNESCAP"/&gt; This is mostly due to the close link between poor governance and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/gov.htm "The IMF and Good Governance"], IMF. Accessed August 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratization===
Because  concepts such as [[civil society]], [[decentralisation]], peaceful conflict management and accountability are often used when defining the concept of good governance, the definition of good governance promotes many ideas that closely align with effective [[democracy|democratic governance]].&lt;ref name = Agere10&gt;Agere 10&lt;/ref&gt; Not surprisingly, emphasis on good governance can sometimes be equated with promoting democratic government. However, a 2011 literature review analyzing the link between democracy and development by Alina Rocha Menocal of the [[Overseas Development Institute]] stresses the inconclusiveness of evidence on this relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Rocha Menocal, A. (2011) [http://www.odi.org.uk/node/8129 "Analysing the relationship between democracy and development"], Overseas Development Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

====Example====
A good example of this close association, for some actors, between western democratic governance and the concept of good governance is the following statement made by U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] in [[Nigeria]] on August 12, 2009:

{{quote|Again, to refer to President Obama's speech, what Africa needs is not more strong men, it needs more strong democratic institutions that will stand the test of time. (Applause.) Without good governance, no amount of oil or no amount of aid, no amount of effort can guarantee Nigeria's success. But with good governance, nothing can stop Nigeria. It's the same message that I have carried in all of my meetings, including my meeting this afternoon with your president. The United States supports the seven-point agenda for reform that was outlined by President Yar'Adua. We believe that delivering on roads and on electricity and on education and all the other points of that agenda will demonstrate the kind of concrete progress that the people of Nigeria are waiting for.}}

==Role of political parties==
Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have criticised past studies of good governance to place too little importance on developing [[political parties]], their capacity and their ties to their grassroots supporters.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Foresti and Wild 2010. S [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5143&amp;title=political-parties-governance-politics "Support to political parties: a missing piece of the governance puzzle"]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; While political parties play a key role in well-functioning democracies, elsewhere political parties are disconnected from voters and dominated by elites, with few incentives or capabilities to increase the representation of other voters.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Political parties can play a key role in pivotal moments of a state's development, either negatively (e.g. organising and instigating violence) or positively (e.g. by leading dialogue in a fractured society).&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; While differences in the [[electoral system]] play their role in defining the number of parties and their influence once in power (proportional, first past the post, etc.), the funding and expertise available to parties also plays an important role not only in their existence, but their ability to connect to a broad base of support.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; While the [[United Nations Development Program]] and the [[European Commission]] have been providing funds to political parties since the 1990s, there are still calls to increase the support for capacity development activities including the development of party manifestos, party constitutions and campaigning skills.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

==Scholarly approaches==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2017}}

[[Nayef Al-Rodhan]], in his 2009 book ''Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man: A Philosophy of History and Civilisational Triumph'', proposed eight minimum criteria for ensuring good national governance.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Rodhan, Nayef R. F., ''Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man: A Philosophy of History and Civilisational Triumph'', LIT, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Al-Rodhan's eight minimum criteria are: 1) participation, equity, and inclusiveness, 2) [[rule of law]], 3) [[separation of powers]], 4) free, independent, and responsible media, 5) government legitimacy, 6) accountability, 7) transparency, and 8) limiting the distorting effect of money in politics. In the book, he argues that good national governance is an important component in creating a history of sustainability for the human race. For Al-Rodhan, the eight minimal criteria of good governance are expressions of the fundamental values of [[democracy]] and more liberal [[constitutionalism]].

The [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment|Tuskegee Study]] from 1932 to 1972 led to the signing of the [[National Research Act]]. This law outlined basic ethical ways in which research is to be carried out. The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (DHEW) made regulations that required voluntary agreements for anyone who was to take part in their studies. Governance is used in scientific studies to ensure that policies are safe and ethical when studies are being done on human subjects. After the [[National Research Act]] there have been other organization put in place such as the Ethics Advisory Board, which reviews biomedical research. Many federal agencies adopted the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Rights in 1991. In 1995 President Bill Clinton established the National Bioethics Advisory Commission led by the Department of Health and Human Services with the task of reviewing regulations and policies to ensure the safety of research volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/after.htm "How Tuskegee Changed Research Practices"]. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, April 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
According to Sam Agere, "The discretionary space left by the lack of a clear well-defined scope for what governance encompasses allows users to choose and set their own parameters."&lt;ref name = Agere4&gt;Agere 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Contesting 'good' governance'', Eva Poluha and Mona Rosendahl contest standards that are common to western democracy as measures of "goodness" in government.&lt;ref name = Poluha&gt;{{cite book| title = Contesting 'good' governance:crosscultural perspectives on representation, accountability and public space | first1 = Eva|last1= Poluha| first2=Mona | last2 = Rosendahl | publisher = Routledge |year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-7007-1494-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nm8pg_i6YPAC }}&lt;/ref&gt; By applying [[political anthropology|political anthropological]] methods, they conclude that while governments believe they apply concepts of good governance while making decisions, cultural differences can cause conflict with the heterogeneous standards of the international community.&lt;ref name = Poluha/&gt;

An additional source of good governance criticism is ''The Intelligent Person's Guide to Good Governance'', written by Surendra Munshi. Munshi's work was created in order to "revive" good governance. Many individuals tend to either wave away and be bored with the idea of governance, or not have a clue to what it has at all. This book is a generalized discussion on what the purpose of good governance is and how it serves that purpose throughout our society. Munshi targets the book toward anyone doing research or just simply "those concerned with the issue of governance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munshi|first1=Surendra |last2=Abraham |first2=Biju Paul |last3=Chaudhuri |first3=Soma |title=The intelligent person's guide to good governance |publisher=Sage Publications |location=New Delhi, India |isbn= 9788178299310}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

''Rethinking Systems: Configurations of Politics and Policy in Contemporary Governance'', written by Michael P. Crozier, is another work analyzing good governance. Crozier's article discusses the different dynamics of changes that occur throughout communication systems and the effect it has on governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crozier |first1=Michael P. |title=Rethinking Systems |journal=Administration &amp; Society |date=16 July 2010 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=504–525 |doi=10.1177/0095399710377443}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of various perspectives is presented throughout the article. This allows the reader to be able to see what contemporary governance is like from different viewpoints. Crozier's motive was to also create an open mindset when referring to how governance and policy within society operate, especially with the constant changes occurring day to day.

'''Hanne Blank''' (born February 25, 1969) is an American historian, writer, editor and public speaker. She has also edited and written [[erotica]] but is retired from that genre.&lt;ref name="hb1"&gt;See [http://www.hanneblank.com/blog/2006/09/28/retirement/ her blog entry about her retirement] for more information.&lt;/ref&gt; Blank believes in [[civil rights]] in general and [[fat acceptance|fat rights]] in particular. She says: "For me, as a progressive [[feminist]], opposing the whole range of physical-body-based prejudices and [[social stigma|stigmas]] is all of a piece. Fatness and fat rights happen to be two of my personal issues, so it's a topic I can speak to from the inside. But fat politics are not separate from my overall politics of inclusion and human value."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Quick Questions: Hanne Blank|url=http://www.bigfatblog.com/node/1042|publisher=Big Fat Blog|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Fritz Scholl''' (22 September 1918&amp;nbsp;– 22 February 1943) was a founding member of the [[White Rose]] [[Widerstand|resistance]] movement in [[Nazi Germany]]. He was executed by the Nazis.

==Biography==
Scholl was born in Ingersheim (now a part of [[Crailsheim]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]). His father, [[Robert Scholl|Robert]], later became the mayor of [[Forchtenberg am Kocher]]. Hans was the second of six children:

# [[Sophie Scholl]] (1921–1943)
# Werner Scholl (1922–1944) [[missing in action]] and presumed dead in June 1944
# Thilde Scholl (1925–1926)

Scholl was raised as a [[Lutheran]], although he did at one point consider converting to Catholicism. 

Scholl joined the [[Hitler Youth]] in 1933, but quickly became disillusioned with the group when he realised its true principles. He later studied medicine at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München Medizin.

==White Rose==
In the early summer of 1942, Scholl, his sister [[Sophie Scholl|Sophie]], [[Willi Graf]], [[Kurt Huber]], [[Christoph Probst]] and [[Alexander Schmorell]] co-authored six anti-Nazi Third Reich political resistance leaflets. Calling themselves the [[White Rose]], they instructed Germans to practice [[nonviolent resistance]] against the Nazis. The group had been horrified by the behavior of some German soldiers on the Eastern Front, where they had witnessed cruelty towards Jews in Poland and Soviet Union.

The leaflets were distributed around the [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich]],&lt;ref name="Halpern 1986-08-17" /&gt;, where the group's members studied, and at the [[University of Hamburg]].{{citation needed|date=October 2008}} Leaflets were also mailed to doctors, scholars, and pub owners throughout Germany.

On 18 February 1943, Hans and Sophie were spotted by a custodian while throwing leaflets from the atrium at Ludwig Maximilians University. They were arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and, with Probst, tried for treason by Judge [[Roland Freisler]]. They were found guilty and condemned to death on 22 February.

Only a few hours after the judgment, Hans and Sophie Scholl and Christopher Probst were beheaded by [[Johann Reichhart]] in Munich's [[Stadelheim Prison]]. The execution was supervised by Dr. Walter Roemer, the enforcement chief of the Munich district court. Scholl's last words were "Es lebe die Freiheit!" ("Long live freedom!").

Shortly thereafter, most of the other students involved with the group were arrested and executed as well.

==Legacy==
[[File:Bommersheim,_Geschwister-Scholl-Gedenkstein.JPG|thumb|right|Scholl memorial in [[Bommersheim]]]]
Following the deaths, a copy of the sixth leaflet was smuggled out of Germany through Scandinavia to the UK by German jurist [[Helmuth James Graf von Moltke]], where it was used by the Allied Forces. In mid-1943, they dropped millions of copies of the tract, retitled [[The Manifesto of the Students of Munich]], over Germany.

The White Rose's legacy has been considered significance by many historical commentators, both as a demonstration of exemplary spiritual courage, and as a well-documented case of social [[dissent]] in a time of violent repression, censorship and [[Conformity|pressure to conform]].

Playwright [[Lillian Garrett-Groag]] stated in ''Newsday'' (22 February 1993):
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is possibly the most spectacular moment of resistance that I can think of in the twentieth century... The fact that five little kids, in the mouth of the wolf, where it really counted, had the tremendous courage to do what they did, is spectacular to me. I know that the world is better for them having been there, but I do not know why.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same issue of ''Newsday'', [[Holocaust]] historian [[Jud Newborn]] noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;You cannot really measure the effect of this kind of resistance in whether or not X number of bridges were blown up or a regime fell... The White Rose really has a more symbolic value, but that's a very important value.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In film==
Hans was portrayed by [[Fabian Hinrichs]] in the film ''[[Sophie Scholl: The Final Days]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8658">The '''Higher Education Price Index'''  ('''HEPI''') is a measure of the [[inflation]] rate applicable to [[United States]]  [[higher education]]. HEPI measures the average relative level in the prices of a fixed market basket of goods and services typically purchased by colleges and universities through current-fund educational and general expenditures, excluding expenditures for research.  Educational and general expenditures include the functions of instruction and departmental research, extension and public services, educational programs such as workshops and instructional institutes supported by sponsors outside the institution, student services, general administration and expenses, staff benefits, libraries, and operation and maintenance of the physical plant.  Sponsored research, sales and services of education departments, and auxiliary enterprises are not priced by HEPI. The index is calculated on a [[fiscal year]] basis ending each June 30,  by the [[Commonfund Institute]], a branch of [[Commonfund]], a [[non-profit]] organization devoted to the management of [[college]] and [[university]] [[Financial endowment|endowments]].&lt;ref&gt;"
Higher Education's Operating Costs Rose by 3.4% in 2007, Down From Last Year's Rate" by Elizabeth Quill, [[Chronicle of Higher Education]] [http://chronicle.com/daily/2007/08/2007080801n.htm?=attn August 8, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonfund.org/Commonfund/Archive/CF+Institute/HEPI_press_release_0807.htm Commonfund Institute News]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and Current Status==
“Dr. D. Kent Halstead is credited with first developing the HEPI for the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (the precursor to the Department of Education) in 1975. Halstead argued that colleges and universities needed a new price index which more closely matched their expenditure patterns, going so far as to declare such an index to be “far superior to substitute proxy indexes such as the Consumer Price Index or the gross national product (GNP) explicit deflator which are intended for entirely different purposes.” Throughout the years, Halstead continued to update the HEPI.&lt;ref name="CollegeAffordability"&gt;http://centerforcollegeaffordability.org/uploads/Stop_Misusing_Price_Indices.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, HEPI has been maintained by the Commonfund Institute, and it relies upon eight separate “cost factors” to construct the overall index. These factors are: faculty salaries, administrative salaries, clerical salaries, service employee salaries, fringe benefits, miscellaneous services, supplies and materials, and utilities.&lt;ref name="CollegeAffordability" /&gt;

“In 2005, Commonfund Institute assumed responsibility for the index and the proprietary model used to calculate HEPI’s values from Research Associates of Washington, D.C. In 2007, in keeping with its commitment to improving and expanding the index, Commonfund Institute inaugurated two additional HEPI services: HEPI calculated by type of institution for six different categories of public and private colleges and universities, and the monthly release, beginning in January of each year, of a forecast of HEPI for the coming fiscal year end.&lt;ref name="CommonfundReport"&gt;https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/1867/1301/3/media.bizj.us/view/img/3864291/hepi-2014-full-report-pdf-9-16-14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, two further improvements were introduced, aligning the estimates and the final HEPI calculation with the July–June academic fiscal year and making available HEPI calculated by region. HEPI forecasts are provided monthly from January through June of each year. The HEPI report is published using the July HEPI figure, which may be subject to a further small adjustment when the last of the underlying data items are finalized in November.&lt;ref name="CommonfundReport" /&gt;

==Five Characteristics==
HEPI has five critical characteristics that should be kept in mind when using it:
# HEPI measures general inflation affecting all colleges and universities in the sector, not any specific institution.
# In measuring average prices, HEPI reflects the quality of typically employed commodities.  Any institutional departure in real expenditure from these averages represents a quality differential.
# HEPI measures price changes for a fixed market basket of goods and services, so it does not account for the budgetary needs of institutions to buy more or better items to meet enrollment expansion, quality improvement, and competition.
# The market basket has remained fixed over the years, which means that the index assumes a typical budget weighting of, for example, the number of gallons of fuel oil versus the number of professors.
# Specialized indices for specific geographic regions and types of institution are included in the annual HEPI Report, but because the data series for which specialized information is available account for less than half of the factor weightings in the HEPI equation, they are of necessity approximations and should be used accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.commonfund.org/CommonfundInstitute/HEPI/Pages/HEPIvsCPI.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
'''How is HEPI calculated?'''
From 1961-2001, HEPI was based on the price data for 25 budget components organized into eight categories – more than 100 items in all. From fiscal year 2002 on, HEPI has been calculated using a regression formula.&lt;ref name="HEPI"&gt;https://www.commonfund.org/CommonfundInstitute/HEPI/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The weighting of each expenditure category is determined by regression analysis (though it appears as though a sample of just 41 colleges is used) that essentially reports the share of total spending for each category. The heaviest weights accompany faculty and clerical salaries and fringe benefits, reflecting their relatively large share in college and university budgets.”&lt;ref name="CollegeAffordability" /&gt;

The regression-based index values are essentially equal to those resulting from complete data. The R-squared value for the regression is .999997809. Regression-calculated HEPI values are not likely to vary from fully compiled values by more than 0.1 parts out of 200.0 or ± 0.05%.&lt;ref name="HEPI" /&gt;

'''Enhanced Methodology'''
Beginning in 2009, the estimates and the final HEPI calculation were calculated using data series that were entirely aligned with the July–June academic fiscal year. Prior to that, the index had been calculated using data drawn from data series with various monthly endpoints. The resulting timing differences in the underlying data had sometimes led HEPI to seem too high or too low relative to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Adoption of the improved methodology led to a restatement of HEPI for the period 2002-2008.

HEPI has useful tools for measuring inflation – but they have to be used appropriately:
* HEPI is useful as an overall measure of inflation affecting the higher education sector, just as consumers everywhere use the national Consumer Price Index (CPI) as a general measure of family purchasing power.
* In an educational context, the CPI is most properly used to adjust faculty and other college and university personnel salaries to dollars of constant purchasing power.&lt;ref name="HEPI" /&gt;

'''Jacqulyn Buglisi''' is an American [[choreographer]], [[artistic director]], [[dancer]], [[educator]], and founder or co-founder of multiple dance institutions. Buglisi, with [[Terese Capucilli]], [[Christine Dakin]] and Donlin Foreman, founded Buglisi Dance Theatre in 1993/94 (formerly BuglisiForeman Dance).

== Choreography ==
Buglisi's ballets are highly visual and imagistic dances that draw from literature, history and heroic archetypes as primary sources. Buglisi's ballets are rooted in strong physical technique. Her repertoire of more than eighty works has been seen by audiences at venues across the United States including:
{{div col|colwidth=25em}}
* [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]]
* [[Joyce Theater]]
* [[Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival]]
* Society of the Performing Arts [[Wortham Theater Center]] – Cullen Theater, Houston
* Kravis Center for the Performing Arts
* Spring to Dance Festival, St. Louis
* SUNY Purchase Performing Arts Center – Concert Hall
* [[Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts]] – Sosnoff Theater
* [[University of Arizona]] – Centennial Hall
{{div col end}}

Internationally, her works have appeared at the Melbourne International Festival- State Theater; during International Dance Week in [[Prague]]; the [[Czech Republic]], [[Japan]], [[Italy]], [[France]] and [[Israel]].

Lynn Garafola of ''[[Dance Magazine]]'' wrote, "Buglisi is a rarity in today's world, a woman who delights in the many splendid forms of female being. Probably no woman, other than Graham, has plumbed such emotional depths choreographically"&lt;ref&gt;

The Jawaharlal Nehru Trust Scholarship U.K. was founded by Admiral Lord Mountbatten of Burma in 1966 as a tribute to the India's first Prime Minister
Jawaharlal Nehru after his death in 1964.  The scholarship was funded by the Nehru Memorial Trust London U.K., and was mostly for one year period for studies in the U.K.
In 1970 the Scholarship was awarded to Dr. Vinod Kumar Chopra ( Ph.D. from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur) for Low Temperature Physics works with Dr. Kurt Mendelssohn, at the Clarendon Laboratory Oxford University, Oxford.  The tenure of his scholarship was extended to 3-years from
Sept 1970 to Oct. 1973.

High Commissioner. The Scholarship was most prestigious{{cn|date=March 2018}} and the scholars were honored by presenting them to the Queen at the Garden Party at the Buckingham Palace. They were invited to the annual Nehru Memorial Lectures also.
The Trust Governors in the U.K were very high level dignitaries, such as Vice Admiral Sir Ronald Brockman, Lord Buttler, Sir Graham Clifford and a few others. The Trust was very liberal in supporting the scholars' attending various international conferences.

The '''Lebanese University''' ({{lang-fr|'''Université libanaise'''}}, {{lang-ar|الجامعة اللبنانية}}) is the only public institution for higher learning in [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name=ofe1jan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ofeish|first=Sami A.|title=Lebanon's second republic: secular talk, sectarian application|journal=Arab Studies Quarterly|date=1 January 1999|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Lebanon's+second+republic%3a+secular+talk%2c+sectarian+application.-a055541673|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, notable professors and educated personalities founded, under the support of the Lebanese President [[Bechara El Khoury]], ''The High House of Teachers'', a class of 68 students making the first class, ever, of the Lebanese University.

The university today has 16 [[faculty (division)|faculties]] and serves all cultural, religious, and social groups of students and teachers. The [[wikt:independent|independent]] university enjoys administrative, academic, and financial freedom. Among its educational goals are creating a unique mix of [[cultures]] and providing the basic and necessary education to allow students to enter various professions.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==History==
The Lebanese University was established in 1951&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Students condemn new registration form, LU denies sectarian claims|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2013/Sep-17/231543-students-condemn-new-registration-form-lu-denies-sectarian-claims.ashx#axzz2knVYWN2T|accessdate=16 November 2013|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=17 September 2013|author=Rayane Abou Jaoude|location=Beirut}}&lt;/ref&gt; to serve the diverse social groups that make up Lebanese society, and to provide a high-level institution in which students can acquire university degrees. It was launched amid a growth in the number of students in grades 10 to 12.

The first departments were ''The High House of Teachers'' and ''The Statistics Center''. On 3 December 1951, the first class of 68 students entered the university, under the efforts of many professors and educated personalities, and the support of the Lebanese President [[Bechara El Khoury]].

On 26 February 1953, official decree No. 25 founded a center for financial and administrative at the university, called ''The Institution of Finance and Administration''. The High House of Teachers was renamed to ''The High Teachers Institution ''.

The next big change was 1959's regulating decree No. 2883, which, along with many others between 1960 and 1972, added more material into the structure of the university and legalized all of its activities, requiring students to take part as administrators within the different faculties.

== University presidents ==
Following is the list of the personalities that served as Presidents of the Lebanese University:

#Fouad Ephrem al-Boustani (1953-1970)
#Edmond Naïm (1970-1976)
# Boutros Dib (1977-1980)
# Georges Tohmé (1980-1988)
# Asaad Diab (1993-2000)
# Ibrahim Kobeissi (2001-2006)
# Zuhair Shokr (2006-2011)
# Adnan Hussein (2011-2016)
# Fouad Ayoub (2016–present)

== Faculties ==
The 16 faculties, including two institutions that were annexed to the university. They are:

#The Faculty of [[Literature]] and [[Human Science]]s.

#The Faculty of [[Public Health]].
#The Faculty of [[Medicine]].
#The Faculty of [[Dentistry]].
#The Faculty of [[Pharmacy]].
#The Faculty of [[Tourism]] and [[Hotel manager|Hotels]].
#The Academic Institution of [[Technology]].

Until 1975, the physical locations of all faculties and institutions were in [[Beirut]] and its suburbs, but during 1976 and due to the [[Lebanese Civil War]] additional branches were founded in [[Beirut]] and the [[governorate]]s of [[Mount Lebanon]], [[North Governorate|North Lebanon]], [[South Lebanon]] and [[Bekaa]]. The increasing difficulty of traveling within the war-torn areas due to the tense atmosphere the country was suffering from led to this decision. However, the [[curriculum|curricula]] and educational content were consolidated among all branches. The Head Office and main administration bureau is in [[Beirut]], opposite to the [[National Museum of Beirut]].

The [[Wiener Zeitung]] described her as an "artist of genius and soul"; the [[:de: Neues Wiener Tagblatt|Neues Wiener Tagblatt]] as "a very remarkable talent" with "perfect technical mastery"; and the [[:de: Neues Wiener Journal|Neues Wiener Journal]] stated that she possessed "perfect domination in the art of movement".&lt;ref&gt;''Lilian Harmel'', ''Lilian Harmel Studio'', ALSERSTRASSE 26, Vienna IX, Austria, (Original Programme 1936).&lt;/ref&gt; In her twenties, she received critical acclaim on the continent, including Paris, Florence, Rome, Milan, Turin, Budapest, Nice, Warsaw, Bratislava, Amsterdam, Venice, Prague, Saltzburg, Geneva and Zurich.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Sketch]]'', June 1938, page 547.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nuovo Gionale wrote of "this refined and elegant dancer", while [[:it:Il Giornale d'Italia|Il Giornale d'Italia]] stated: "Lilian Harmel is a true artist, who expresses with her perfect technique the pictures of her fantasy, the sentiments of her soul and the spirit of ballet." [[La Nazione]] wrote: "the technique of this dancer is perfect, there is true precision of form, absolute ability of means, sureness in balance, the gifts of musicality and a complete power of expression."&lt;ref&gt;''Lilian Harmel'', ''Lilian Harmel Studio'', ALSERSTRASSE 26, Vienna IX, Austria, (Original Programme 1936).&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to [[Paris]] in 1936, where she was filmed for an early French television broadcast. She subsequently moved to England with her fiancé in 1938. On her arrival in England, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote "she has a very personable appearance and possesses imagination and intelligence... she is both interesting and striking", while the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' described her as "an original and gifted exponent of pure dancing both in technique and interpretation", and ''[[The Sketch]]'' welcomed her as "a brilliant young dancer".&lt;ref&gt;''A Dancing Recital: Lilian Harmel's London Debut'', ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', Friday 17 June 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily Mail]]'', Ballet Review, Lilian Harmel, June 17th, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Sketch]]'', June 1938, page 547.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, she opened a dance studio inside her house in [[Hampstead]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Higher Education Supplement'','' Dance Theatre'', Friday May 24, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; By 1957, her classes had over 25 young children and 25 teenage and adult students. She had originally intended to teach children temporarily, but was persuaded to continue after Hampstead parents had told her "they think it is most necessary in Hampstead."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Higher Education Supplement'','' Dance Theatre'', Friday May 24, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; ''Many Moons'', her children's ballet, was performed on [[ITV Network|ITV]] on Christmas Day 1967. Harmel was an early pioneer in the setting of electronic and contemporary music to dance, choreographing performances to [[Edgard Varèse]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Pierre Boulez]], and [[Cesar Bresgen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Saltzburger Volksblatt'', ''Junge Tanzgruppe'', August 4th, 1971, (Folge 178), Selte 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In her teaching, she came to conceive of dance as a process of personal discovery, rather than mere performance.&lt;ref&gt;''The Child's Feeling for Movement'', Lilian Harmel, ''The New Era in Home and School'', Vol. 37, No.3, March 1956, pages 86-7.&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, in the tradition of the [[Tanztheater]], her Hampstead classes accepted students of all abilities, both amateurs and professionals,&lt;ref&gt;''Kaleidoscope at the Hampstead Theatre'', ''Daily Telegraph'', July 5, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; so long as they shared her passion for individual development. To celebrate her forty years of teaching, in 1978, at the age of 70, she performed a final solo dance at the [[Hampstead Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''Lilian Harmel'', ''Dancing Times'', June 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Morley-Priestman, ''The Stage and Television Today'', June 8, 1978, page 11&lt;/ref&gt; On her death, ''The Times'' wrote: "she enriched generations of children and dance students through her concern for the artistic development of the individual... she and her work were a beacon".&lt;ref&gt;''Lilian Harmel'', ''[[The Times]]'', ''[[obituary]]'', Saturday, August 14, 1982, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Friends and collaborators included [[Rudolf Laban]], [[Cesar Bresgen]], [[Marie-Louise von Motesiczky]], [[Mary Wigman]], [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 3rd Baronet|Charles Philips Trevelyan]], [[Georges-Emmanuel Clancier]], [[:de: Felix Albrecht Harta|Felix Albrecht Harta]], [[Adrian Stokes (critic)|Adrian Stokes]], [[Hilde Holger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hildeholger.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=55]

The '''Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities''' is the ministry of the government of [[Ontario]] responsible for administration of laws relating to post-secondary education and skills training. This ministry is one of two education ministries, the other being the [[Ministry of Education (Ontario)|Ministry of Education]] (responsible for primary and secondary schools across Ontario). The Ministry's offices are in downtown [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]]. The current minister is [[Merrilee Fullerton]].

==History==
In May, 1964, the ''Department of University Affairs Act'' was passed establishing the '''Department of University Affairs'''. The department was charged with administering the government's support programs for higher education, previously the responsibility of the Department of Education. [[Bill Davis]], the inaugural minister, was the [[Ministry of Education (Ontario)|Minister of Education]] at the time and continued to hold the position after the department's establishment.

In addition to jurisdiction over higher education, The department also had financial jurisdiction over the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], the [[Royal Botanical Gardens (Ontario)|Royal Botanical Gardens]] and the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]].  In October 1971, the department's size was doubled by the addition of the Applied Arts and Technology Branch of the Department of Education. In light of this expansion of functions, the name of the department was changed to the '''Department of Colleges and Universities'''.

It was renamed the '''Ministry of Colleges and Universities''' in 1972 as part of a government-wide restructuring.  In 1975, various cultural programs and institutions of the ministry were transferred to the newly created [[Ministry of Culture (Ontario)|Ministry of Culture and Recreation]].

In 1985, a separate '''Ministry of Skills Development''' was created. In 1993, the Ministry of Colleges and Universities, the [[Ministry of Education (Ontario)|Ministry of Education]] and the Ministry of Skills Development were combined to form the '''Ministry of Education and Training'''.

In June 1999, the responsibilities for post-secondary education and skills development were again given to a standalone ministry, named the '''Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities'''.  Briefly between 2016 and 2018, it was renamed the '''Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development'''.

==Governance==

The Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities is a member of the [[Executive Council of Ontario]] (or cabinet) reporting to the [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]] and held accountable by the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]. The [[deputy minister]] manages the operations of the ministry that includes five main divisions. As a whole, the ministry has responsibility for administration of laws relating to postsecondary education and skills training in Ontario. The divisions cover employment and training, postsecondary education, strategic policy and programs, corporate management and services, and French-language education and educational operations.&lt;ref name="MTCU-Org Chart"&gt;Ministry of Training, Colleges, and Universities Ontario (2008, May 29).

In French culture, the word '''''mémoire''''', as in '''un mémoire''' ("a memory" – indefinite article), reflects the writer's own experiences and memories. The word has no direct English translation.

==Up to the 18th century==
The word appeared in the course of the 12th century. In this era, it simply meant an explanatory text written to show an idea.  Little by little, and above all in the modern era, the term became synonymous with an argumentative piece of writing, serving and asserting an idea.  [[Vauban]] also wrote mémoires to Louis XIV on fortifications, such as ''Mémoire pour servir d'instruction dans la conduite des sièges et dans la défense des places, par M. le maréchal de Vauban, présenté au Roi en 1704'',&lt;ref&gt;''Mémoire to serve for instruction in the conduct of sieges and the defence of places, by Marshal Vauban, presented to the King in 1704'' - Publication :  A Leide : chez J. et H. Verbeek, 1740. In-4°&lt;/ref&gt; and the religious quarrels of the time also produced several mémoires.&lt;ref&gt;In the 18th century, in the arguments over [[Jansenism]], the subtitle of the work ''[[Nouvelles ecclésiastiques]]'' was '''''Mémoire''' pour servir à l'histoire de la Constitution [[Unigenitus]]'' (Mémoire to serve as a history of the Unigentus Bull)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution in the 19th century==
In the course of the 19th century, ''mémoire'' took on a sense that approaches the sense it holds today.  It lost its [[polemic]]al character and became a scientific text (or one that wanted to be scientific), for showing a fact, principal or idea.  The mémoire thus became shorter and shorter, serving to enlighten the reader on a precise point such as a subject that had to be treated by the administration or politicians.&lt;ref&gt;''Mémoire sur l'importance pour l'histoire intime des communes de France des actes notariés antérieurs à 1790, et sur la nécessité et les moyens d'en assurer la conservation et la publicité'' ; par M. Gustave Saint-Joanny, ... (12 octobre 1860-22 mai 1864.), Thiers, Cuissac, 1861–1864&lt;/ref&gt; All university writings in this era, however, were still called [[thesis|theses]] – ''mémoire'' did not yet have a university sense.

==University mémoires==
The development of using ''mémoire'' to mean a piece of university writing occurred in the course of the 20th century. In effect, the organisation of university studies made it necessary to have a more precise definition, which create the level of [[Master's degree|"maîtrise"]].

A "maîtrise" (now called [[Master's degree in Europe#France|Master 1]]) student's work, if it was original research, could not be called a thesis, for the student generally did not invent a concept or a new theory at this level.  The term "mémoire" thus often came to be used, as it fitted this subject well - showing a fact, research, in a relatively boiled-down format.

The pursuit of apprenticeships in research work involved students in editing a "second mémoire", at [[Master's degree in Europe#France|Master 2]] (formerly [[DEA (former French degree)|DEA]]) level, often as a feasibility study for a full thesis.  This too was of quite a boiled-down format and showed the tools which would eventually allow the student to set out on a thesis.  For a Master 2 in social sciences or literature, a "mémoire" comprises a description of the sources which would allow future work on a thesis, the necessary bibliography, an exposé of the problems involved as defined by the student, and one or two attempts at edited-down chapters, showing that the problems, sources and bibliography could lead to a real work of original research.

On the other hand, one rarely speaks of a "mémoire de thèse", as this is too voluminous, and its usage is only to qualify that the thesis is all the student's own work.

The same organization says the test is to be available in the public sector in 2014, but it is already available for individual taking in 2013.&lt;ref name="niied1"/&gt; The NEAT organization provides a conversion sheet comparing NEAT scores to TOEIC and TOEFL scores. The test is aimed primarily at evaluating academic preparation (such as for entrance to universities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/southkoreaneducation/home/english-education-in-south-korea/national-english-ability-test |title=National English Ability Test - South Korean Education |publisher=Sites.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hwang2012" /&gt;  Even though one of NEAT's aims is to get away from "[[teaching to the test]]," there are already a number of study books written specifically as NEAT preparation material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyobobook.co.kr/search/SearchKorbookMain.jsp |title=[인터넷교보문고&amp;#93; 꿈을 키우는 세상 |language=Korean |publisher=Kyobobook.co.kr |date= |accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the exam was given to Korean English teachers.  As a result of errors uncovered in the test as well as difficulties that teachers had, the original implementation date of using NEAT to test for English skills as an official part of college application was delayed from 2015 to 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internationalednews.com/2013/06/27/south-korea-6/ |title=South Korea &amp;#124; International Education News |publisher=Internationalednews.com |date=2013-06-27 |accessdate=2013-11-01 |author=DoKyoung Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2013/05/113_135615.html | title=Homegrown English tests in trouble | accessdate=2013-11-01 | publisher=[[The Korea Times]] |author=Bahk Eun-ji}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3319">'''Norland College''', founded in 1892 by [[Emily Ward]], is a provider of childcare training and education. Norland trainees are employed worldwide as [[nanny|nannies]], [[Nursery school|nursery]] nurses and in other positions in a variety of settings for childcare.

Throughout its history the college has been based at various locations throughout the [[United Kingdom]], notably [[Chislehurst]] in [[Kent]] and [[Denford Park]] near [[Hungerford]] in [[Berkshire]], and is currently based in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. Originally the college contained daycare and boarding facilities for infants, and was a training college for nannies. Now the college at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] is solely a training facility without integral childcare facilities.

The College focuses on only one degree programme: the BA (Hons) in Early Years Development and Learning, in association with the [[University of Gloucestershire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norland.co.uk/courses |title=Courses at Norland College |publisher=Norland College |accessdate=9 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219010028/http://www.norland.co.uk/courses |archivedate=19 February 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{recentism|section|date=June 2013}}
In February 1981 the BBC filmed a documentary about Norland on the current affairs programme Nationwide.

In February 1999, the first male nanny trainee was accepted since the inception of the college in 1892, and in 2012 the first male undergraduate was admitted.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9526118/Meet-the-Norland-Manny-teenager-is-first-undergraduate-at-worlds-most-famous-nanny-academy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A so-called Sky Nannies diploma was introduced, in 2006, which specializes in the care of children during aeroplane trips.

In 2005/6 a documentary called ''Nanny School'' was filmed showing a year at Norland College. It consisted of 15 episodes (5 per term) and was shown on Discovery Home and Health (UK) in October 2007.

Norland College in Bath opened a nursery in the summer 2009.

'''Norman E. Gibbs''' (November 27, 1941 – April 25, 2002) was an American software engineer, scholar and educational leader.

He studied to a [[B.Sc.]] in [[mathematics]] at [[Ursinus College]] (1964) and [[M.Sc.]] (1966) and [[Ph.D.]] (1969) in [[Computer Science]] at [[Purdue University]], advised by [[Robert R. Korfhage]].  His research area was cycle generation, an area in [[graph theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatphil.org/maths/resources/Gibbs_BasicCycleGeneration.html Algorithm 491] from Comm. of the ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;
Gibbs joined the faculty at [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Maine]], [[Arizona State University]] and [[College of William and Mary]] (mathematics) in [[Virginia]] before moving to [[Pittsburgh]], joining [[Carnegie Mellon University]] as [[professor]] of computer science and becoming the first director of the educational program at the [[Software Engineering Institute]] (1987–97).  Since then he was [[chief information officer]] at [[Guilford College]] in [[Greensboro]] and [[University of Connecticut]], jointly serving as professor of Operations and Information management.  He eventually worked for [[Ball State University]] as chair of computer science (2000–02).&lt;ref&gt;[http://tab.computer.org/fase/fase-archive/v12/v12n05.txt Norm Gibbs - a leader in Software engineering education] from [[IEEE]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
In the opening of the book, Rose states:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;The heart of this book is the tricks, shortcuts and industry practices developed over nearly a century, since the beginning of radio and talking pictures.  In the 40-some years I've been at this, I've worked on tracks ranging from sales videos to theatrical features...and seen my projects win Clios, an Emmy, and hundreds of other awards...This book is an attempt to share as much as I can.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
''Producing Great Sound for Film and Video'' is broken into four main sections, ordered to reflect real-world filming situations:  
*Audio Basics
*Planning and Pre-Production
*Production Sound
*Post Production

Subjects covered include [[Analog recording|analog]] versus [[digital audio]], [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]] and using [[sound effect]]s, microphone techniques, [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|ADR]], [[Audio mixing|mixing]], and [[Audio mastering|mastering]].

One section highlighted as unique by ''[[Videomaker Magazine]]'' was that on "editing voices."&lt;ref name="VM3rdEd" /&gt;  Rose breaks down how human speech works, and how that translates to film and video productions.  Tips include stealing unvoiced sounds from other characters or people speaking in a scene, and using them to replace problematic recordings of others.  The "editing voices" section also discusses sounds with "hard attacks" and training the ear to hear [[phoneme]]s, which helps in isolating and correcting speech recording issues.

Numerous "recipes" for dealing with common sound issues, such as reducing or eliminating echo on sets, and removing line hum and buzz from recorded audio, are also provided.

Eliva Silva writing for ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'' said of the book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[It is] the whole theory -- and beautiful theory -- on the science of audio and the way that audio is recorded through voltage, converted into digital information, back to voltage into sound.&lt;ref name="SAE"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silva|first1=Eliva|title=So Whatcha Doin'? Pablo Véliz|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/11358CB5E1908398?p=AWNB|work=San Antonio Express-News|date=August 6, 2006|accessdate=February 15, 2016|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fIoToQCM|archivedate=February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Style ==
Author Rose states in the book that he wishes to appeal to technical and non-technical people alike, adding he hopes to keep the book approachable and conversational in tone, dispelling the idea that audio needs to be difficult to understand.  He states that audio is not "rocket science." While the book does contain math and science, Rose points out the math is elementary school level and the physics is "common sense."

The current version of the book provides downloadable files including sample sounds and music, diagnostic tools and additional tutorials allowing the reader to practice with the principles explained. Earlier versions of the book included a CD-ROM of similar assets.

In 2003, ''Millimeter Magazine'' felt the style was right for the time:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Digital artists are very much hands-on, and Rose is the right man to write audio books for this new generation of filmmakers. Rose operates his own boutique sound studio and bridges the analog and digital eras - he's made the discoveries and mistakes that no one should have to learn on the job. This direct experience with DV equipment and projects is apparent throughout the book.&lt;ref name="Mil" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Critical reviews ===
Covering the first edition of the book, ''[[Videomaker Magazine]]'' noted the high price tag of the book, but said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;With PBS and Turner Network Television production experience under his belt, author Jay Rose brings a wealth of experience to ''Producing Great Sound for Digital Video''...the book is replete with facts and useful information.&lt;ref name="VideoMaker1stEd" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of the second edition, ''Millimeter Magazine'' said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Shortchanging film sound is typical of new filmmakers, and the emphasis on picture over sound is a bias running through film schools and film publications - articles, books, and courses on visual subjects far outnumber those on film sound. Author Jay Rose is single-handedly addressing the problem.&lt;ref name="Mil" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Hartney writing for ''[[Creative COW]]'' said of the second edition, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;...it offers such a wide range of usable information about hands-on digital audio production, that by reading it, the reader is empowered with production skills and enlightened by an appreciation of how the experience of audio enriches video.&lt;ref name="COW"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hartney|first1=John|title=John Hartney reviews: Producing Great Sound for Digital Video, Second edition|url=https://library.creativecow.net/articles/hartney_john/jay_rose_audio.php|website=[[Creative COW]]|accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2008, covering the third edition of the book, ''[[Videomaker Magazine]]'' awarded it "five out of five stars" and said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have been looking for this book for 20 years - no exaggeration...The chapter on Editing Voices alone is worth the price tag.&lt;ref name="VM3rdEd" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Entertainment industry reviews ===
Academy Award winner [[Randy Thom]] (director of Sound Design at [[Skywalker Sound]],&lt;ref name="SkySoundThmo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Randy Thom|url=http://www.skysound.com/people/randy-thom/|website=[[Skywalker Sound]]|accessdate=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oscar winner for ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'' and ''[[The Incredibles]]''&lt;ref name="IMDBThom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Randy Thom - Awards|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0858378/awards|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) wrote praise of the author and book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Jay Rose is one of the leaders in spreading the gospel of using sound creatively. He presents cutting-edge ideas about the collaboration of sound and image, and also covers the basics… all in an easy to read, easy to understand style.&lt;ref name="PubSite" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominated sound mixer [[Jeff Wexler]]&lt;ref name="IMDbWexler"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeff Wexler Awards|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0923306/awards|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]], [[The Last Samurai]], [[Fight Club]]'') wrote a blurb for the book stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This is the definitive book. It should be mandatory reading for anyone who is seriously considering a career making movies."&lt;ref name="PubSite" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Raspberry Pi''' is a series of small [[single-board computer]]s developed in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Raspberry Pi Foundation]] to promote teaching of basic [[computer science]] in schools and in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Cellan-Jones |first= Rory |title= A£15 computer to inspire young programmers |work=BBC News|date= 5 May 2011 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/rorycellanjones/2011/05/a_15_computer_to_inspire_young.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Price |first= Peter |title= Can a £15 computer solve the programming gap? |publisher= [[Click (TV programme)|BBC Click]] |date= 3 June 2011 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/9504208.stm |accessdate= 2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/2011/05/25/51129/Dongle-computer-lets-kids-discover-programming-on-a.htm |title= Dongle computer lets kids discover programming on a TV |accessdate= 11 July 2011 |last= Bush |first= Steve |date= 25 May 2011 |work= [[Electronics Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original model became far more popular than anticipated,&lt;ref name="1000x"/&gt; selling outside its [[target market]] for uses such as [[robotics]].  It does not include peripherals (such as [[keyboard (computing)|keyboard]]s and [[mouse (computing)|mice]]) and [[computer case|case]]s.  However, some accessories have been included in several official and unofficial bundles.&lt;ref name="1000x"/&gt;

The organisation behind the Raspberry Pi consists of two arms.  The first two models were developed by the [[Raspberry Pi Foundation]].  After the Pi Model B was released, the Foundation set up Raspberry Pi Trading, with [[Eben Upton]] as CEO, to develop the third model, the B+.  Raspberry Pi Trading is responsible for developing the technology while the Foundation is an educational charity to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools and in developing countries.

According to the Raspberry Pi Foundation, more than 5 million Raspberry Pis were sold by February 2015, making it the best-selling [[British computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/18/raspberry-pi-becomes-best-selling-british-computer|title=Raspberry Pi becomes best selling British computer|date=18 February 2015|first=Samuel|last=Gibbs|work=The Guardian|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By November 2016 they had sold 11 million units,&lt;ref name="11 million" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ten-millionth-raspberry-pi-new-kit/|title=Ten millionth Raspberry Pi, and a new kit – Raspberry Pi|date=8 September 2016|newspaper=Raspberry Pi|access-date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 12.5m by March 2017, making it the third best-selling "general purpose computer".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/17/14962170/raspberry-pi-sales-12-5-million-five-years-beats-commodore-64|title=Raspberry Pi sold over 12.5&amp;nbsp;million boards in five years|work=The Verge|access-date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, sales reached nearly 15 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://betanews.com/2017/07/19/raspberry-pi-eben-upton-qa/|title=Raspberry Pi founder Eben Upton talks sales numbers, proudest moments, community projects, and Raspberry Pi 4 [Q&amp;A]|work=Betanews|access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2018, sales reached 19 million.&lt;ref name="RapsberryPi3B+Release"&gt;{{cite news |last=Upton |first=Eben |authorlink=Eben Upton |url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-3-model-bplus-sale-now-35/ |title=Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ on Sale at $35 |work=Raspberry Pi Blog |publisher=Raspberry Pi Foundation |date=14 March 2018 |accessdate=2018-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generations of released models ==
[[File:Raspberry-Pi-Zero-FL.jpg|link=File:Raspberry-Pi-Zero-FL.jpg|thumb|right|The Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;Zero, a US$5 model first introduced in 2015]]
Several generations of Raspberry Pis have been released. All models feature a [[Broadcom Corporation|Broadcom]] [[system on a chip]] (SoC) with an integrated [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-compatible [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and [[Graphics processing unit#Integrated graphics|on-chip graphics processing unit]] (GPU).

Processor speed ranges from 700&amp;nbsp;MHz to 1.4&amp;nbsp;GHz for the Pi&amp;nbsp;3 Model B+; on-board memory ranges from 256&amp;nbsp;MB to 1&amp;nbsp;GB RAM.  [[Secure&amp;nbsp;Digital]] (SD) cards are used to store the operating system and program memory in either SDHC (early Raspberry Pi's) or MicroSDHC (Later Raspberry Pi's) sizes.  The boards have one to four [[USB]] ports.  For video output, [[HDMI]] and [[composite video]] are supported, with a standard 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm [[phone connector (audio)|tip-ring-sleeve]] jack for audio output.  Lower-level output is provided by a number of [[General-purpose input/output|GPIO]] pins, which support common protocols like [[I²C]].  The B-models have an [[8P8C]] [[Ethernet]] port and the Pi&amp;nbsp;3 and Pi Zero&amp;nbsp;W have on-board [[Wi-Fi]] [[802.11n]] and [[Bluetooth]].  Prices range from US$5 to $35.

The first generation ('''Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;1 Model&amp;nbsp;B''') was released in February 2012, followed by the simpler and cheaper '''Model&amp;nbsp;A'''.  In 2014, the Foundation released a board with an improved design, '''Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;1 Model&amp;nbsp;B+'''.  These boards are approximately credit-card sized and represent the standard ''mainline'' form-factor. Improved A+ and B+ models were released a year later. A [[#Compute module|"Compute Module"]] was released in April 2014 for [[Embedded system|embedded applications]]. The '''Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;2''', which added more [[random-access memory]], was released in February 2015.

A '''Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;Zero''' with smaller size and reduced [[input/output]] (I/O) and [[general-purpose input/output]] (GPIO) capabilities was released in November 2015 for US$5.  By 2017, it became the newest mainline Raspberry Pi. On 28 February 2017, the '''Raspberry Pi Zero&amp;nbsp;W''' was launched, a version of the Zero with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, for US$10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/new-10-raspberry-pi-zero-comes-with-wi-fi-and-bluetooth/|title=New $10 Raspberry Pi Zero comes with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth|work=Ars Technica|access-date=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3175256/computers/the-10-raspberry-pi-zero-w-brings-wi-fi-and-bluetooth-to-the-minusule-micro-pc.html|title=The $10 Raspberry Pi Zero W brings Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to the minuscule micro|work=PC World|access-date=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 12 January 2018, the '''Raspberry Pi Zero&amp;nbsp;WH''' was launched, the same version as the Zero W with pre-soldered GPIO headers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/zero-wh|title=Zero WH: Pre-soldered headers and what to do with them|work=Raspberry Pi Foundation|access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;3 Model&amp;nbsp;B''' was released in February 2016 with a 64-bit [[Multi-core processor|quad core]] processor, on-board [[Wi-Fi|WiFi]], [[Bluetooth]] and USB boot capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/pi-3-interview/|title=Eben Upton talks Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;3 |work=The MagPi Magazine|date=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On [[Pi Day]] 2018 '''model&amp;nbsp;3B+''' appeared with a faster 1.4 GHz processor and a three times faster network based on [[gigabit Ethernet]] (throughput limited to ca. 300&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s by the internal USB&amp;nbsp;2.0 connection) or 2.4 / 5 GHz [[dual-band]] Wi-Fi (100 Mbit / s).&lt;ref name="RapsberryPi3B+Release"/&gt;  Other options are: [[Power over Ethernet]] (PoE), [[USB-bootable Linux distribution|USB boot]] and [[Network booting|network boot]] (an [[SD card]] is no longer required).

== Hardware ==
The Raspberry Pi hardware has evolved through several versions that feature variations in [[Computer memory|memory]] capacity and peripheral-device support.
[[File:Raspberrypi block function v01.svg|thumb]]
This block diagram describes Model&amp;nbsp;B and B+; Model&amp;nbsp;A, A+, and the Pi&amp;nbsp;Zero are similar, but lack the [[Ethernet]] and [[USB]] hub components. The Ethernet adapter is internally connected to an additional USB port. In Model&amp;nbsp;A, A+, and the Pi&amp;nbsp;Zero, the USB port is connected directly to the [[system on a chip]] (SoC). On the Pi&amp;nbsp;1 Model&amp;nbsp;B+ and later models the USB/Ethernet chip contains a five-port USB hub, of which four ports are available, while the Pi&amp;nbsp;1 Model&amp;nbsp;B only provides two. On the Pi&amp;nbsp;Zero, the USB port is also connected directly to the SoC, but it uses a [[micro USB]] (OTG) port.

=== Processor ===
[[File:Raspberry-Pi-2-Bare-BR.jpg|thumb|The Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;2B uses a 32-bit 900&amp;nbsp;MHz quad-core [[ARM Cortex-A7]] processor.]]
The [[Broadcom]] BCM2835 SoC used in the first generation Raspberry Pi&lt;ref name="Broadcom-BCM2835-Website"/&gt; includes a 700&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]] [[ARM11]] 76JZF-S processor, [[VideoCore]] IV [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU),&lt;ref name="grandmax brose 2012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.grandmax.net/2012/01/broadcom-bcm2835-soc-has-powerful.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218012632/http://www.grandmax.net/2012/01/broadcom-bcm2835-soc-has-powerful.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 February 2012|title=Broadcom BCM2835 SoC has the most powerful mobile GPU in the world?|date=30 January 2012|work=Grand MAX|accessdate=13 April 2012|author=Brose, Moses|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and RAM. It has a level 1 (L1) [[CPU cache|cache]] of 16&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KB]] and a level 2 (L2) cache of 128&amp;nbsp;KB.  The [[level 2 cache]] is used primarily by the GPU. The SoC is [[package on package|stacked]] underneath the RAM chip, so only its edge is visible. The 1176JZ(F)-S is the same CPU used in the [[IPhone (1st generation)|original iPhone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/2782|title=The iPhone 3GS Hardware Exposed &amp; Analyzed|last=Shimpi|first=Anand Lal|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; although at a higher [[clock rate]], and mated with a much faster GPU.

The earlier V1.1 model of the Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;2 used a Broadcom BCM2836 SoC with a 900&amp;nbsp;MHz [[32-bit]], [[Quad Core|quad-core]] [[ARM Cortex-A7]] processor, with 256&amp;nbsp;KB shared L2 cache.&lt;ref name="2-B-Announcement"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-2-on-sale/ |title=Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;2 on sale now at $35 |publisher=Raspberry Pi Foundation |accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;V1.2 was upgraded to a Broadcom BCM2837 SoC with a 1.2&amp;nbsp;GHz [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] quad-core [[ARM Cortex-A53]] processor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs-europe.electrocomponents.com/webdocs/1568/0900766b8156853c.pdf|title=Raspberry Pi 2, Model B V1.2 Technical Specifications|publisher=[[RS Components]]|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same SoC which is used on the Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;3, but [[Underclocking|underclocked]] (by default) to the same 900 MHz CPU clock speed as the V1.1. The BCM2836 SoC is no longer in production as of late 2016.

The Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;3+ uses a Broadcom BCM2837B0 SoC with a 1.4&amp;nbsp;GHz 64-bit quad-core [[ARM Cortex-A53]] processor, with 512&amp;nbsp;KB shared L2 cache.&lt;ref name="RapsberryPi3B+Release"/&gt;

==== Performance ====
While operating at 700&amp;nbsp;MHz by default, the first generation Raspberry Pi provided a real-world performance roughly equivalent to 0.041&amp;nbsp;[[FLOPS|GFLOPS]].&lt;ref name=eLinux-perf&gt;{{cite web|title=Performance – measures of the Raspberry Pi's performance.|url=http://elinux.org/RPi_Performance|work=RPi Performance|publisher=eLinux.org|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hackaday-raspi&gt;{{cite web|last=Benchoff|first=Brian|title=64 Rasberry Pis turned into a supercomputer|url=http://hackaday.com/2012/09/12/64-rasberry-pis-turned-into-a-supercomputer/|publisher=Hackaday|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] level the performance is similar to a 300&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Pentium II]] of 1997–99.  The GPU provides 1&amp;nbsp;[[Gpixel]]/s or 1.5&amp;nbsp;[[Texel (graphics)|Gtexel]]/s of graphics processing or 24&amp;nbsp;[[FLOPS|GFLOPS]] of general purpose computing performance. The graphical capabilities of the Raspberry Pi are roughly equivalent to the performance of the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] of 2001.

Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;2 V1.1 included a quad-core [[ARM Cortex-A7|Cortex-A7]] CPU running at 900&amp;nbsp;MHz and 1&amp;nbsp;GB RAM. It was described as 4–6 times more powerful than its predecessor. The GPU was identical to the original.&lt;ref name="2-B-Announcement" /&gt; In parallelised benchmarks, the Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;2 V1.1 could be up to 14 times faster than a Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;1 Model&amp;nbsp;B+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raspberry Pi2 – Power and Performance Measurement|url=http://raspi.tv/2015/raspberry-pi2-power-and-performance-measurement|website=RasPi.TV|publisher=RasPi.TV|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;3, with a quad-core [[ARM Cortex-A53]] processor, is described as having ten times the performance of a Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-3-on-sale/|title=Raspberry Pi 3 on sale now at $35 – Raspberry Pi|last=Upton|first=Eben|date=29 February 2016|website=Raspberry Pi|access-date=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was suggested to be highly dependent upon task [[Thread (computing)|threading]] and [[instruction set]] use.  Benchmarks showed the Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;3 to be approximately 80% faster than the Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;2 in [[Parallel computing|parallelised]] tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Much Power Does Raspberry Pi3B Use? How Fast Is It Compared To Pi2B?|url=http://raspi.tv/2016/how-much-power-does-raspberry-pi3b-use-how-fast-is-it-compared-to-pi2b|website=RasPi.TV|publisher=RasPi.TV|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Overclocking ====
Most Raspberry Pi [[System on a chip|systems-on-chip]] could be [[overclocking|overclocked]] to 800&amp;nbsp;MHz, and some to 1000&amp;nbsp;MHz. There are reports the Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;2 can be similarly overclocked, in extreme cases, even to 1500&amp;nbsp;MHz (discarding all safety features and over-voltage limitations). In the [[#Software|Raspbian]] [[Linux distro]] the overclocking options on [[booting|boot]] can be done by a software command running "sudo raspi-config" without voiding the warranty.&lt;ref name="Turbo mode"/&gt;  In those cases the Pi automatically shuts the overclocking down if the chip [[temperature]] reaches {{convert|85|C|F}}, but it is possible to override automatic over-voltage and overclocking settings (voiding the warranty); an appropriately sized [[heat sink]] is needed to protect the chip from serious [[Overheating (electricity)|overheating]].

Newer versions of the [[firmware]] contain the option to choose between five overclock ("turbo") presets that when used, attempt to maximise the performance of the SoC without impairing the lifetime of the board.  This is done by monitoring the core temperature of the chip and the [[Load (computing)|CPU load]], and dynamically adjusting [[Clock rate|clock speeds]] and the [[CPU core voltage|core voltage]].  When the demand is low on the CPU or it is running too hot the performance is [[Throttling process (computing)|throttled]], but if the CPU has much to do and the chip's temperature is acceptable, performance is temporarily increased with clock speeds of up to 1&amp;nbsp;GHz, depending on the individual board and on which of the turbo settings is used.

The seven overclock presets are:

* none; 700&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM, 250&amp;nbsp;MHz core, 400&amp;nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 0 [[overvolting]]
* modest; 800&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM, 250&amp;nbsp;MHz core, 400&amp;nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 0 overvolting,
* medium; 900&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM, 250&amp;nbsp;MHz core, 450&amp;nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 2 overvolting,
* high; 950&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM, 250&amp;nbsp;MHz core, 450&amp;nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 6 overvolting,
* turbo; 1000&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM, 500&amp;nbsp;MHz core, 600&amp;nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 6 overvolting,
* Pi&amp;nbsp;2; 1000&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM, 500&amp;nbsp;MHz core, 500&amp;nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 2 overvolting,
* Pi&amp;nbsp;3; 1100&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM, 550&amp;nbsp;MHz core, 500&amp;nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 6 overvolting. In system information the CPU speed will appear as 1200&amp;nbsp;MHz. When idling, speed lowers to 600&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name="Turbo mode"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing turbo mode: up to 50% more performance for free| url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/introducing-turbo-mode-up-to-50-more-performance-for-free/ | publisher=Raspberrypi.org| accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="turbosgithub"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/asb/raspi-config/blob/master/raspi-config|title=asb/raspi-config on Github| publisher=asb|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the highest (''turbo'') preset the SDRAM clock was originally 500&amp;nbsp;MHz, but this was later changed to 600&amp;nbsp;MHz because 500&amp;nbsp;MHz sometimes causes SD card corruption. Simultaneously in ''high'' mode the core clock speed was lowered from 450 to 250&amp;nbsp;MHz, and in ''medium'' mode from 333 to 250&amp;nbsp;MHz.

The Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;Zero runs at 1&amp;nbsp;GHz.

The CPU on the first and second generation Raspberry Pi board did not require cooling, such as a heat sink or [[Computer fan|fan]], even when overclocked, but the Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;3 may generate more heat when overclocked.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/overclocking.md] Overclocking options – raspberrypi.org&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RAM ===
On the older beta Model&amp;nbsp;B boards, 128&amp;nbsp;MB was allocated by default to the GPU, leaving 128&amp;nbsp;MB for the CPU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/oicyr/i_have_a_raspberry_pi_beta_board_ama/c3hj3n0 |title=I have a Raspberry Pi Beta Board AMA |publisher=Reddit.com |date=15 January 2012 |accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the first 256&amp;nbsp;MB release Model&amp;nbsp;B (and Model&amp;nbsp;A), three different splits were possible. The default split was 192&amp;nbsp;MB (RAM for CPU), which should be sufficient for standalone 1080p video decoding, or for simple 3D, but probably not for both together. 224&amp;nbsp;MB was for Linux only, with only a 1080p [[framebuffer]], and was likely to fail for any video or 3D. 128&amp;nbsp;MB was for heavy 3D, possibly also with video decoding (e.g. XBMC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raspberrypi.org/forum/general-discussion/config-txt/page-3 Raspberry Pi boot configuration text file] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316062124/http://www.raspberrypi.org/forum/general-discussion/config-txt/page-3 |date=16 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparatively the [[Nokia 701]] uses 128&amp;nbsp;MB for the Broadcom VideoCore IV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/forum/general-discussion/nokia-701-has-a-similar-broadcom-gpu |title=Nokia 701 has a similar Broadcom GPU |publisher=Raspberrypi.org |date=2 February 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205011054/http://www.raspberrypi.org/forum/general-discussion/nokia-701-has-a-similar-broadcom-gpu |archivedate=5 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the later Model&amp;nbsp;B with 512&amp;nbsp;MB RAM new standard memory split files (arm256_start.elf, arm384_start.elf, arm496_start.elf) were initially released for 256&amp;nbsp;MB, 384&amp;nbsp;MB and 496&amp;nbsp;MB CPU RAM (and 256&amp;nbsp;MB, 128&amp;nbsp;MB and 16&amp;nbsp;MB video RAM) respectively. But a week or so later the RPF released a new version of start.elf that could read a new entry in config.txt (gpu_mem=''xx'') and could dynamically assign an amount of RAM (from 16 to 256&amp;nbsp;MB in 8&amp;nbsp;MB steps) to the GPU, so the older method of memory splits became obsolete, and a single start.elf worked the same for 256&amp;nbsp;MB and 512&amp;nbsp;MB Raspberry Pis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2296|title=introducing new firmware for the 512&amp;nbsp;MB Pi|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;2 and the Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;3 have 1&amp;nbsp;GB of RAM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/raspberry-pi-3-specs-benchmarks/ |title=Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;3 specs |website=''raspberrypi.com'' |publisher=Magpi |accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/ |title=Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;2 specs |website=''raspberrypi.com'' |accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;Zero and Zero&amp;nbsp;W have 512&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM.

=== Networking ===
The Model&amp;nbsp;A, A+ and Pi&amp;nbsp;Zero have no Ethernet circuitry and are commonly connected to a network using an external user-supplied USB Ethernet or [[Wi-Fi]] adapter. On the {{nowrap|Model B and B+}} the Ethernet port is provided by a built-in USB Ethernet adapter using the SMSC LAN9514 chip.&lt;ref name="SMSC-LAN9514-specs"/&gt;&lt;!-- Clearly visible on the PCB photos for the 1B+ and 2B --&gt; The Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;3 and Pi Zero&amp;nbsp;W (wireless) are equipped with 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz WiFi [[IEEE 802.11n-2009|802.11n]] {{nowrap|(150 Mbit/s)}} and [[Bluetooth 4.1]] {{nowrap|(24 Mbit/s)}} based on the Broadcom BCM43438 [[Wireless network interface controller#FULLMAC|FullMAC]] chip with no official support for [[monitor mode]] but implemented through unofficial firmware patching&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon|title=seemoo-lab/nexmon|website=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Pi&amp;nbsp;3 also has a 10/100&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s Ethernet port. The Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;3B+ features dual-band [[IEEE 802.11|IEEE 802.11b/g/n/ac WiFi]], [[Bluetooth 4.2]], and [[1000BASE-T|Gigabit Ethernet]] (limited to approximately 300 Mbit/s by the [[USB 2.0]] bus between it and the SoC).

=== Special-Purpose Features ===
The Pi Zero can be used as a USB device or "USB gadget", plugged into another computer via a USB port on each machine.  It can be configured in multiple ways, for example to show up as a serial device or an ethernet device.&lt;ref name="adafruitgadget"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://learn.adafruit.com/turning-your-raspberry-pi-zero-into-a-usb-gadget/overview|title=Turning your Pi Zero into a USB gadget}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although originally requiring software patches, this was added into the mainline Raspbian distribution in May 2016.&lt;ref name="adafruitgadget"/&gt;

The Pi 3 can boot from USB, such as from a flash drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/msd.md|title=How to boot from a USB mass storage device}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of firmware limitations in other models, the Pi 3 is the only board that can do this.

The Raspberry Pi may be operated with any generic [[USB computer keyboard]] and [[Computer mouse|mouse]].&lt;ref name="VerifiedPeripheralList"/&gt; It may also be used with USB storage, USB to MIDI converters, and ''virtually'' any other device/component with USB capabilities.

Other peripherals can be attached through the various pins and connectors on the surface of the Raspberry Pi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio-plus-and-raspi2/|title=GPIO: Models&amp;nbsp;A+, B+, Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;B and Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;B – Raspberry Pi Documentation|website=''raspberrypi.org''|access-date=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video controller can generate standard modern TV resolutions, such as HD and [[Full HD]], and higher or lower monitor resolutions as well as older NTSC or PAL standard CRT TV resolutions. As shipped (i.e., without custom overclocking) it can support the following resolutions: 640×350 [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]]; 640×480 [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]]; 800×600 [[Super video graphics array|SVGA]]; 1024×768 [[XGA]]; 1280×720 [[720p]] [[High-definition television#High-definition display resolutions|HDTV]]; 1280×768 [[Graphic display resolutions#WXGA|WXGA]] variant; 1280×800 [[Graphic display resolutions#WXGA|WXGA]] variant; 1280×1024 [[SXGA]]; 1366×768 [[Graphic display resolutions#WXGA|WXGA]] variant; 1400×1050 [[SXGA+]]; 1600×1200 [[UXGA]]; 1680×1050 [[WXGA+]]; 1920×1080 [[1080p]] [[High-definition television#High-definition display resolutions|HDTV]]; 1920×1200 [[WUXGA]].&lt;ref name="video"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elinux.org/RPi_config.txt |title=Raspberry Pi, supported video resolutions |publisher=eLinux.org |date=30 November 2012 |accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher resolutions, up to 2048×1152, may work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/5/topics/2144 |title=Pi Screen limited to 1920 by RISC&amp;nbsp;OS:- |work=RISC&amp;nbsp;OS Open |quote=2048 × 1152 monitor is the highest resolution the Pi's GPU can handle [presumably with non-low frame-rate ..] The monitors screen info confirms the GPU is outputting 2048×1152 |accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/5/topics/2653|title=RISC OS Open: Forum: Latest Pi firmware?}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even 3840×2160 at 15&amp;nbsp;Hz (too low a frame rate for convincing video).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=79330 |title=Raspberry Pi and 4k @ 15Hz |quote=I have managed to get 3840 x 2160 (4k x 2k) at 15Hz on a Seiki E50UY04 working |accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note also that allowing the highest resolutions does not imply that the GPU can decode video formats at these resolutions; in fact, the Pis are known to not work reliably for [[H.265]] (at those high resolutions), commonly used for very high resolutions (however, most common formats up to Full HD do work).

Although the Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;3 does not have H.265 decoding hardware, the CPU is more powerful than its predecessors, potentially fast enough to allow the decoding of H.265-encoded videos in software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://osmc.tv/2016/02/raspberry-pi-3-announced-with-osmc-support/ |title=Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;3 announced with OSMC support |date=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GPU in the Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;3 runs at higher clock frequencies of 300&amp;nbsp;MHz or 400&amp;nbsp;MHz, compared to previous versions which ran at 250&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs-europe.electrocomponents.com/webdocs/14ba/0900766b814ba5fd.pdf |title=Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;3 Model&amp;nbsp;B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Raspberry Pis can also generate [[576i]] and [[480i]] [[composite video]] signals, as used on old-style ([[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]) TV screens and less-expensive monitors through standard connectors{{snd}}either RCA or 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm phono connector depending on models. The television signal standards supported are [[PAL#PAL-B/G/D/K/I|PAL-BGHID]], [[PAL-M]], [[PAL-N]], [[NTSC]] and [[NTSC-J]].&lt;ref name="composite"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ozolins |first=Jason |url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/forum/general-discussion/pictures-of-screen-displaying-example-of-rpi-composite-output?value=480i&amp;type=1&amp;include=2&amp;search=1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130113113342/http://www.raspberrypi.org/forum/general-discussion/pictures-of-screen-displaying-example-of-rpi-composite-output?value=480i&amp;type=1&amp;include=2&amp;search=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 January 2013 |title=examples of Raspberry Pi composite output |publisher=Raspberrypi.org |accessdate=22 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Real-time clock ===
None of the current Raspberry Pi models have a built-in [[real-time clock]], so they are unable to keep track of the time of day independently. As a workaround, a program running on the Pi can retrieve the time from a [[Network Time Protocol|network time server]] or from user input at boot time, thus knowing the time while powered on. To provide consistency of time for the [[file system]], the Pi automatically saves the current system time on shutdown, and re-loads that time at boot.

A real-time hardware clock with battery backup, such as the DS1307, may be added (often via the [[I²C]] interface).  Note however that this conflicts with the camera's CSI interface, effectively disabling the camera.

=== Accessories ===
* Gertboard – A Raspberry Pi Foundation sanctioned device, designed for educational purposes, that expands the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins to allow interface with and control of LEDs, switches, analogue signals, sensors and other devices. It also includes an optional [[Arduino]] compatible controller to interface with the Pi.&lt;ref name="Gertboard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1734|title=Gertboard is here!|date=8 August 2012|publisher=Raspberry Pi Foundation|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Camera – On 14 May 2013, the foundation and the distributors RS Components &amp; Premier Farnell/Element 14 launched the Raspberry Pi camera board alongside a firmware update to accommodate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elinux Wiki: Description of Raspberry Pi Camera Board|url=http://elinux.org/Rpi_Camera_Module|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camera board is shipped with a [[flexible flat cable]] that plugs into the [[Camera Serial Interface|CSI]] connector which is located between the Ethernet and HDMI ports. In Raspbian, the user must enable the use of the camera board by running Raspi-config and selecting the camera option. The camera module costs €20 in Europe (9 September 2013).&lt;ref name="farnellcam"/&gt; It can produce [[1080p]], [[720p]] and [[480p|640x480p]] video. The dimensions are {{nowrap|25 mm × 20 mm × 9 mm}}.&lt;ref name="farnellcam"&gt;{{cite web|title=RPI Camera board – Raspberry-Pi – Raspberry Pi Kamera-Board, 5MP &amp;#124; Farnell Deutschland |url=http://de.farnell.com/raspberry-pi/rpi-camera-board/raspberry-pi-camera-board-5mp/dp/2302279 |accessdate=9 June 2013|publisher=de.farnell.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, v2 of the camera came out, and is an 8 megapixel camera.

=== Driver APIs ===
{{See also|VideoCore#Linux support}}
[[File:Raspberrypi video API 03.svg|thumb|Scheme of the implemented [[Application programming interface|APIs]]: [[OpenMAX]], [[OpenGL ES]] and [[OpenVG]] ]]

Raspberry Pi can use a [[VideoCore]] IV GPU via a [[binary blob]], which is loaded into the GPU at boot time from the [[Secure Digital|SD-card]], and additional software, that initially was [[Closed source software|closed source]].&lt;ref name="h-online 2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Raspberry-Pi-warms-up-1341629.html |title=Raspberry Pi warms up |work=[[The H]] |date=13 September 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2012 |author=djwm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the driver code was later released.&lt;ref name="ARMuserland"/&gt; However, much of the actual driver work is done using the closed source GPU code. Application software makes calls to closed source run-time libraries ([[OpenMax]], [[OpenGL ES]] or [[OpenVG]]), which in turn call an open source driver inside the Linux kernel, which then calls the closed source VideoCore IV GPU driver code. The [[Application programming interface|API]] of the kernel driver is specific for these closed libraries. Video applications use [[OpenMAX]], {{nowrap|[[3D computer graphics|3D applications]]}} use [[OpenGL ES]] and {{nowrap|[[2D computer graphics|2D applications]]}} use [[OpenVG]], which both in turn use [[EGL (OpenGL)|EGL]]. OpenMAX and EGL use the open source kernel driver in turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/592 |publisher=raspberrypi.org |title=Libraries, codecs, OSS |date=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Firmware ===
The official firmware is a [[freely redistributable software|freely redistributable]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-firmware/blob/master/LICENCE.broadcom|title=Hexxeh/rpi-firmware|website=''github.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[binary blob]], that is [[closed-source]].&lt;ref name=haiku/&gt; A minimal proof-of-concept open source firmware is also available, mainly aimed at initializing and starting the ARM cores as well as performing minimal startup that is required on the ARM side. It is also capable of booting a very minimal [[Linux kernel]], with patches to remove the dependency on the mailbox interface being responsive. It is known to work on Raspberry Pi 1, 2 and 3, as well as some variants of Raspberry Pi Zero. While it is in a working state, it is not actively developed, with last significant commits made around mid-2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/christinaa/rpi-open-firmware |title=christinaa/rpi-open-firmware |website=''github.com'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, a [[switched-mode power supply]] chip, designated U16, of the Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;2 Model&amp;nbsp;B version&amp;nbsp;1.1 (the initially released version) was found to be vulnerable to flashes of light,&lt;ref name="U16 forums"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=99042 |title=Raspberry Pi Forums: Why is the PI2 camera-shy? |author=several authors |work=Raspberry Pi Forums |publisher=Raspberry Pi Foundation |date=7–9 February 2015 |accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the light from [[Flashtube#Xenon|xenon camera flashes]] and green&lt;ref name="U16 Hackaday"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hackaday.com/2015/02/08/photonic-reset-of-the-raspberry-pi-2/ |title=Photonic Reset of the Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;2 |publisher=Hackaday |date=8 February 2015 |accessdate=8 February 2015 |author=Benchoff, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and red [[laser pointer]]s. However, other bright lights, particularly ones that are on continuously, were found to have no effect. The symptom was the Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;2 spontaneously rebooting or turning off when these lights were flashed at the chip. Initially, some users and commenters suspected that the [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) from the xenon flash tube was causing the problem by interfering with the computer's digital circuitry, but this was ruled out by tests where the light was either blocked by a card or aimed at the other side of the Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;2, both of which did not cause a problem. The problem was narrowed down to the U16 chip by covering first the [[system on a chip]] (main processor) and then U16 with [[Blu-Tack]] (an opaque poster mounting compound). Light being the sole culprit, instead of EMP, was further confirmed by the laser pointer tests,&lt;ref name="U16 Hackaday" /&gt; where it was also found that less opaque covering was needed to shield against the laser pointers than to shield against the xenon flashes.&lt;ref name="U16 forums" /&gt; The U16 chip seems to be bare silicon without a plastic cover (i.e. a [[chip-scale package]] or [[wafer-level package]]), which would, if present, block the light. Unofficial workarounds include covering U16 with opaque material (such as electrical tape,&lt;ref name="U16 forums" /&gt;&lt;ref name="U16 Hackaday" /&gt; lacquer, poster mounting compound, or even balled-up bread&lt;ref name="U16 forums" /&gt;), putting the Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;2 in a case,&lt;ref name="U16 Hackaday" /&gt; and avoiding taking photos of the top side of the board with a xenon flash. This issue was not caught before the release of the Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;2 because while commercial electronic devices are routinely subjected to tests of susceptibility to radio interference, it is not standard or common practice to test their susceptibility to optical interference.&lt;ref name="U16 forums" /&gt;

In June 2017, Raspberry Pi won the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] [[MacRobert Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ingenia.org.uk/Ingenia/Articles/1107/ "Chips that changed the classroom"] Ingenia, September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The citation for the award to the Raspberry Pi said it was "for its inexpensive credit card-sized microcomputers, which are redefining how people engage with computing, inspiring students to learn coding and computer science and providing innovative control solutions for industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/news/news-releases/2017/june/the-coding-revolution-marches-on-raspberry-pi-wins/|title=The coding revolution marches on: Raspberry Pi wins UK’s top engineering innovation prize|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community ===
The Raspberry Pi community was described by Jamie Ayre of [[FLOSS]] software company [[AdaCore]] as one of the most exciting parts of the project.&lt;ref name="computerweekly community 2012" /&gt; Community blogger Russell Davis said that the community strength allows the Foundation to concentrate on documentation and teaching.&lt;ref name="computerweekly community 2012" /&gt; The community developed a [[fanzine]] around the platform called ''[[The MagPi]]''&lt;ref name="thedigitallifestyle dixon 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedigitallifestyle.com/w/index.php/2012/05/06/the-magpi-raspberry-pi-online-magazine-launched/|title=The MagPi – Raspberry Pi online magazine launched|work=The Digital Lifestyle.com|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in 2015, was handed over to the Raspberry Pi Foundation by its volunteers to be continued in-house.&lt;ref name="all change meet the new magpi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/all-change-meet-the-new-magpi/|title=All change – meet the new MagPi|work=Raspberry Pi|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of community ''Raspberry Jam'' events have been held across the UK and around the world.&lt;ref name="raspberry jam"&gt;{{cite web|title=Raspberry Jam|url=http://raspberrypi.org.uk/jam/|work=Raspberry Pi web|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use in education ===
{{As of|January 2012}}, enquiries about the board in the United Kingdom have been received from schools in both the [[state school|state]] and [[Private school (United Kingdom)|private]] sectors, with around five times as much interest from the latter. It is hoped that businesses will sponsor purchases for less advantaged schools.&lt;ref name="guardian reboot computing" /&gt; The CEO of Premier Farnell said that the government of a country in the Middle East has expressed interest in providing a board to every schoolgirl, to enhance her employment prospects.&lt;ref name="guardian 700-per-sec 2012"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/05/raspberry-pi-demand |title=Raspberry Pi demand running at '700 per second' |work=[[The Guardian]]  |date=5 March 2012 |accessdate=12 March 2012 |author=Arthur, Charles |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Raspberry Pi mini computer sells out after taking 700 orders per second|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/raspberry-pi-mini-computer-sells-out-after-taking-700-orders-per-second/|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=Digital Trends}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Raspberry Pi Foundation hired a number of its community members including ex-teachers and software developers to launch a set of free learning resources for its website.&lt;ref name="welcome to our website"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/welcome-to-our-new-website/ |title=Welcome to our new website |publisher=[[Raspberry Pi Foundation]]  |date=2 April 2014 |accessdate=15 March 2015 |author=Upton, Liz |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation also started a teacher training course called [[Picademy]] with the aim of helping teachers prepare for teaching the new computing curriculum using the Raspberry Pi in the classroom.&lt;ref name="picademy free cpd for teachers"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/picademy-free-cpd-for-teachers/ |title=Picademy – free CPD for teachers |publisher=[[Raspberry Pi Foundation]]  |date=17 March 2014 |accessdate=15 March 2015 |author=Philbin, Carrie Anne |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[NASA]] launched the ''JPL Open Source Rover Project'', which is a scaled down of [[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity rover]] and uses a Raspberry Pi as the control module, to encourage students and hobbyists to get involved in mechanical, software, electronics, and robotics engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover|title=nasa-jpl/open-source-rover|website=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use in home automation ===
There are a number of developers and applications that are leveraging the Raspberry Pi for [[home automation]]. These programmers are making an effort to modify the Raspberry Pi into a cost-affordable solution in energy monitoring and power consumption. Because of the relatively low cost of the Raspberry Pi, this has become a popular and economical alternative to the more expensive commercial solutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ijcsmc.com/docs/papers/May2015/V4I5201599a70.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use in industrial automation ===
In June 2014, TECHBASE, Polish industrial automation manufacturer designed the world's first industrial computer based on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module, called ModBerry. The device has numerous interfaces, most notably RS-485/232 serial ports, digital and analogue inputs/outputs, CAN and economical 1-Wire buses, all of which are widely used in the automation industry. The design allows the use of the Compute Module in harsh industrial environments, leading to the conclusion that the Raspberry Pi is no longer limited to home and science projects, but can be widely used as an [[Internet of things|Industrial IoT]] solution and achieve goals of [[Industry 4.0]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://linuxgizmos.com/automation-controller-taps-raspberry-pi-compute-module/|title=Automation controller taps Raspberry Pi Compute Module|date=25 June 2014|work=''LinuxGizmos.com''|access-date=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, SUSE announced commercial support for SUSE Linux Enterprise on the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B to support a number of undisclosed customers implementing industrial monitoring with the Raspberry Pi. [&lt;ref&gt;https://www.suse.com/c/small-server-big-companies-new-raspberry-pi-support-sles-arm/ A small server for big businesses&lt;/ref&gt;]

Slice is a [[digital media player]] which also uses a Compute Module as its heart. It was crowd-funded in an August 2014 Kickstarter campaign. The software running on Slice is based on [[Kodi (software)|Kodi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slice : A media player and more by Five Ninjas|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fiveninjas/slice-a-media-player-and-more|website=Kickstarter|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Astro Pi ==
A project was launched in December 2014 at an event held by the UK Space Agency. The Astro Pi competition was officially opened in January and was opened to all primary and secondary school aged children who were residents of the United Kingdom. During his mission, British ESA astronaut [[Tim Peake]] deployed the computers on board the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/watch-tim-peake-astro-pi-flight-units-in-space/|title=Watch Tim Peake with the Astro Pi flight units in space!|date=7 March 2016|publisher= Raspberry Pi Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; He loaded the winning code while in orbit, collected the data generated and then sent this to Earth where it was distributed to the winning teams. Covered themes during the competition included Spacecraft Sensors, Satellite Imaging, Space Measurements, Data Fusion and Space Radiation.

The organisations involved in the Astro Pi competition include the [[UK Space Agency]], UKspace, Raspberry Pi, ESERO-UK and [[ESA]].

* March 2012 – The Debian port is initiated by Mike Thompson, former CTO of [[Atomz]]. The effort was largely carried out by Thompson and Peter Green, a volunteer Debian developer, with some support from the Foundation, who tested the resulting binaries that the two produced during the early stages (neither Thompson nor Green had physical access to the hardware, as boards were not widely accessible at the time due to demand).&lt;ref name="ars-volunteers"&gt;{{cite web

The POC image was based on then-[[Debian stable|stable]] [[Debian Squeeze]], while Raspbian aimed to track then-upcoming [[Debian Wheezy]] packages.&lt;ref name="POC-image"/&gt; Aside from the updated packages that would come with the new release, Wheezy was also set to introduce the armhf architecture,&lt;ref name="armhf"&gt;{{cite web

The Squeeze-based POC image was limited to the armel architecture, which was, at the time of Squeeze's release, the latest attempt by the Debian project to have Debian run on the newest ARM [[embedded-application binary interface]] (EABI).&lt;ref name="armel"&gt;{{cite web

* 3 June 2013 – 'New Out of Box Software or [[NOOBS]] is introduced. This makes the Raspberry Pi easier to use by simplifying the installation of an operating system. Instead of using specific software to prepare an SD card, a file is unzipped and the contents copied over to a FAT formatted (4&amp;nbsp;GB or bigger) SD card. That card can then be booted on the Raspberry Pi and a choice of six operating systems is presented for installation on the card. The system also contains a recovery partition that allows for the quick restoration of the installed OS, tools to modify the config.txt and an online help button and web browser which directs to the Raspberry Pi Forums.&lt;ref name="noobs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/4100 |title=Introducing the New Out of Box Software (NOOBS) |publisher=RPF |date=3 June 2013 |accessdate=4 June 2013 |author=Upton, Liz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 7 April 2014 – The official Raspberry Pi blog announced the Raspberry Pi Compute Module, a device in a 200-pin DDR2 [[SO-DIMM]]-configured memory module (though not in any way compatible with such RAM), intended for consumer electronics designers to use as the core of their own products.&lt;ref name="CM-Announcement" /&gt;
* June 2014 – The official Raspberry Pi blog mentioned that the three millionth Pi shipped in early May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/raspberry-pi-at-buckingham-palace-3-million-sold/ |title=RASPBERRY PI AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE, 3 MILLION SOLD |accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 14 July 2014 – The official Raspberry Pi blog announced the Raspberry Pi Model&amp;nbsp;B+, "the final evolution of the original Raspberry Pi. For the same price as the original Raspberry Pi model&amp;nbsp;B, but incorporating numerous small improvements people have been asking for".&lt;ref name=B-Plus-Announcement /&gt;
* 10 November 2014 – The official Raspberry Pi blog announced the Raspberry Pi Model&amp;nbsp;A+.&lt;ref name="A-Plus-Announcement"/&gt; It is the smallest and cheapest {{nowrap|(US$20)}} Raspberry Pi so far and has the same processor and RAM as the Model&amp;nbsp;A. Like the A, it has no Ethernet port, and only one USB port, but does have the other innovations of the B+, like lower power, micro-SD-card slot, and 40-pin HAT compatible GPIO.
* 2 February 2015 – The official Raspberry Pi blog announced the Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;2. Looking like a Model&amp;nbsp;B+, it has a 900&amp;nbsp;MHz quad-core ARMv7 Cortex-A7 CPU, twice the memory (for a total of 1&amp;nbsp;GB) and complete compatibility with the original generation of Raspberry Pis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/raspberry-pi-2-on-sale |title=Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;2 on sale now at $35 Raspberry Pi |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 26 November 2015 – The Raspberry Pi Foundation launched the Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;Zero, the smallest and cheapest member of the Raspberry Pi family yet, at 65&amp;nbsp;mm × 30&amp;nbsp;mm, and US$5. The Zero is similar to the Model&amp;nbsp;A+ without camera and LCD connectors, while smaller and uses less power. It was given away with the Raspberry Pi magazine Magpi No. 40 that was distributed in the UK and US that day{{snd}} the MagPi was sold out at almost every retailer internationally due to the freebie.&lt;ref name="Zero-Announcement"/&gt;
* 29 February 2016 – Raspberry Pi&amp;nbsp;3 with a BCM2837 1.2&amp;nbsp;GHz 64-bit quad processor based on the ARMv8 Cortex-A53, with built-in Wi-Fi BCM43438 802.11n 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz and Bluetooth 4.1 Low Energy (BLE). Starting with a 32-bit Raspbian version, with a 64-bit version later to come if "there is value in moving to 64-bit mode". In the same announcement it was said that a new BCM2837 based Compute Module was expected to be introduced a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

A '''Ringgold Identifier''' (Ringgold ID or RIN) is a persistent numeric [[unique identifier]] for organizations in the publishing industry supply chain.&lt;ref name="RG"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ringgold.com/|title=Ringgold Inc|publisher=Ringgold Inc|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NISO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niso.org/workrooms/i2|title=Institutional Identifiers (I2)|publisher=National Information Standards Organization|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ringgold's Identify Database includes almost 500,000 Ringgold IDs representing organizations and consortia who acquire scholarly publications and content.&lt;ref name="RG-PSI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ringgold.com/identify|title=Solutions - Identify Database|publisher=Ringgold Inc|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ringgold ID was introduced in 2003. Ringgold developed it in response to an issue raised by [[Oxford University Press]], namely how to identify institutional subscribers unambiguously.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ringgold.com/ringgold-identifier|title=Ringgold Identifier|publisher=Ringgold Inc|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is owned and administered by Ringgold, Inc. and Ringgold, Ltd., who also publish a [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] for classifying the subject interests of the listed organizations.&lt;ref name="RG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JISC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk/UKSG/292/Ringgolds-new-subject-taxonomy/?n=121b8a3f-e721-4bc0-8354-7ad4d47f99de|title=UKSG eNews|date=2013-03-12|publisher=[[Jisc|JISC]]|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|sixth form}}
In the education systems of [[Education in England|England]], [[Education in Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]], [[Education in Wales|Wales]] and some other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, '''sixth form''' (sometimes referred to as [[Key Stage 5]]) represents the final 1-3 years of [[secondary education]] (high school), where students (typically between 16 and 18 years of age) prepare for their [[GCE Advanced Level|A-level]] (or equivalent) examinations.

==England and Wales==
The term ''sixth form'' describes the school years numbered 12 and 13, which are called the ''Lower Sixth'' (L6) and ''Upper Sixth'' (U6) by many schools.

The term survives from an earlier system when the first five years of English secondary schooling were known as ''forms'' (which would originally have been long backless benches on which rows of pupils sat in the classroom). Pupils started their first year of secondary school in the ''first form'' or [[first year]], and this was the [[academic year]] in which pupils would normally become 12 years of age. Pupils would move up a form each year before entering the fifth form in the academic year in which they would have their sixteenth birthday. Those who stayed on at school to study for [[A-levels]] moved up into the sixth form, which was divided into the Lower Sixth and the Upper Sixth. In some private schools, the term ''Middle Sixth'' was used in place of Upper Sixth, with the latter being used for those who stayed on for an extra term to take the entrance examinations that were previously set for candidates to [[Oxford University|Oxford]] or [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] universities. Other schools described these ''[[Oxbridge]]'' examination students as being in the ''Seventh Form'' or ''Third Year Sixth''.

The system was changed for the 1990–1991 academic year and school years are now numbered consecutively from primary school onwards. ''[[Year One (School)|Year 1]]'' is the first year of primary school after [[Reception (School)|Reception]]. The first year of secondary school (the old first form) is now known as ''[[Year Seven (School)|Year 7]]''. The Lower Sixth is now '''Year 12''' and the Upper Sixth is '''Year 13'''. However, the term "Sixth Form" has still been retained as a vestige of the old system and is used as a collective term for Years 12 and 13. [[Public school (United Kingdom)|Public (fee-charging) schools]], along with some [[state school]]s, tend to use the old system of numbering.

In some parts of the country, special [[sixth form college]]s were introduced beginning in a particularly important phase of student life. A large proportion of English secondary schools no longer have an integral sixth form. This is mainly related to reforms in the later 20th century, where different political areas became a factor in the introduction of colleges instead of the original sixth forms. There are now numerous sixth form colleges throughout England and Wales, and in areas without these, sixth form schools and specialist [[further education]] (FE) colleges called tertiary colleges may fill the same role.

Sixth form is not compulsory in England and Wales (although from 2013 onwards, people of sixth form age must remain in some form of education or training in England only, the school leaving age remains 16 in Wales); however, university entrance normally requires at least three A2-level qualifications and perhaps one AS-level. Students usually select three or four subjects from the [[GCSE]]s they have just taken, for one "AS" year, the AS exams being taken at the end of Lower Sixth. Three subjects are then carried into the A2 year (the dropped AS being "cashed in" as a qualification) and further exams are taken at the end of that year. The marks attained in both sets of exams are converted into [[UCAS]] points, which must meet the offer made by the student's chosen university.

==Northern Ireland==
In Northern Ireland, the equivalent of Reception is "P1", and the equivalent of the English Year 1 "P2", while the first year of secondary school is known as ''Year 8'' or ''first year'' (rather than ''Year 7'' as in England), and following that Lower and Upper Sixth are Year 13 and Year 14 respectively.

==Scotland==
In the Scottish education system, the final year of school is known as ''Sixth Year'' or ''S6''. During this year, students typically study [[Advanced Higher (Scottish)|Advanced Higher]] and/or [[Higher (Scottish)|Higher]] courses in a wide range of subjects, taking [[Scottish Qualifications Authority|SQA]] exams at the end of both S5 and S6. Pupils in [[Scotland]] may leave once they have reached the age of 16; those who reach 16 before 30&amp;nbsp;September may leave after national examinations in May, whilst those who are 16 by the end of February may leave the previous Christmas.

It is not essential for candidates to do a sixth year if they wish to attend a Scottish university, as they have obtained adequate Higher grades in S5 they may apply and receive acceptance, but this is conditional on being successful in the examinations. However, the vast majority of Scottish students return for S6 if they plan to attend university. Some English universities will also accept Scottish students who have obtained adequate Higher grades in S5. It was announced in December 2008 that, as from 2010, [[UCAS]] will increase the number of points awarded to those who achieve Highers and Advanced Highers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7787540.stm BBC News Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, particularly in independent schools, the term ''sixth form'' is also used for the last two years of secondary education. An increasing number of independent schools are offering their students the [[International Baccalaureate Programme]].

{{S-end}}

==Other countries==
In some [[secondary school]]s in [[Hong Kong]], [[Jamaica]], [[Barbados]], [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]], the sixth and seventh years are called Lower and Upper Sixth respectively. In [[India]] and [[Nepal]], it is the "+2" part of the "10+2" educational system. 

In 2009, [[Malaysia]], which previously used ''Tingkatan Enam Bawah dan Atas'' (Lower and Upper Sixth), switched to ''Pra-Universiti 1'' (Pre-University 1, replacing Lower Sixth) and ''Pra-Universiti 2'' (Pre-University 2, replacing Upper Sixth) to reflect that the sixth and seventh years prepare students for university. Students prepare to sit the [[Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia]] at the end of the years.

Similarly, the term ''sixth form'' is also used to define the final two years of education before entering university in [[Malta]].

In Singapore, however, the equivalent of a sixth form college would be called a ''[[junior college]]'', where pupils take their Cambridge GCE A-levels after two years. Prior to the 1990s, these two years were known as "Pre-University" (Pre-U) 1 and 2.

In some college preparatory schools in the United States, such as [[The Hill School]], [[Woodberry Forest School]], [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School]], [[Kent School]], [[Pomfret School]], The [[Church Farm School]], The [[Haverford School]], [[Portsmouth Abbey School]] and more, ''sixth form'' refers to the final year of education prior to college. It is the equivalent of [[twelfth grade]] in the US education system.

In [[New Zealand]], under the [[Education in New Zealand#Years of schooling|old system]] of Forms, Standards and Juniors, Sixth Form was the equivalent of Year 12 in today's system. Year 13 was known as Seventh Form. [[Australia]] also sometimes uses the term for Year 12, though the Australian Year 12 is equivalent to the NZ Year 13&amp;nbsp;/ Seventh Form and the UK's Upper Sixth&amp;nbsp;/ Year 13.

In [[Brunei]], sixth form comprises Year 12 and 13, which may also be referred to as Lower and Upper Six. At the end of the schooling, students sit for [[GCE Advanced Level|Brunei-Cambridge GCE A Level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.bn/SitePages/Post%20Secondary%20Education.aspx|title=Ministry of Education, Brunei Darussalam - Post Secondary Education|website=www.moe.gov.bn|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students may also opt to take [[Advanced Subsidiary Level]] or AS Level halfway at the end of Lower Six or halfway through Upper Six. Sixth form is not compulsory, but a preferable choice for students wishing to continue in academic studies leading to university level.

'''StarLogo''' is an [[Computer simulation#Types|agent-based]] [[simulation language]] developed by [[Mitchel Resnick]], Eric Klopfer, and others at [[MIT Media Lab]] and [[MIT]] Scheller Teacher Education Program in [[Massachusetts]]. It is an extension of the [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]] [[Computer programming|programming]] [[Programming language|language]], a [[Programming language dialect|dialect]] of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]. Designed for [[education]], StarLogo can be used by students to model the behavior of decentralized systems.

The first StarLogo ran on a [[Connection Machine]] 2 parallel computer. A subsequent version ran on [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers; this version became known later as MacStarLogo (and now is called MacStarLogo Classic). The current StarLogo is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and works on most computers.

StarLogo is also available in a version called '''OpenStarLogo'''. The source code for OpenStarLogo is available online, although the license under which it is released is not an open source license according to the [[Open Source Definition]], because of restrictions on the commercial use of the code.

'''StarLogo TNG''' (The Next Generation) version 1.0 was released in July 2008. It provides a 3D world using OpenGL graphics and a block-based graphical language to increase ease of use and learnability. It is written in C and Java. StarLogo TNG uses "blocks" to put together puzzle-like pieces. StarLogo TNG reads the blocks in the order you fit them together, and sets the program in the Spaceland view.

StarLogo is a primary influence for the '''Kedama''' particle system, programmed by Yoshiki Oshima, found in the  [[Etoys (programming language)|Etoys]] educational programming environment and language, which can be viewed as a Logo done originally in [[Squeak]] [[Smalltalk]].

==Latest Version==
The latest version of StarLogo, '''[http://www.slnova.org/ StarLogo Nova]''', was released in beta form in the summer of 2014. StarLogo Nova takes the blocks language and 3D visualization engine of StarLogo TNG and brings them to the web browser. StarLogo Nova's execution engine is built on the Flash runtime and includes a purpose-built instancing rendering engine (using the Adobe Molehill 3D graphics API) capable of rendering tens of thousands of independently moving agents on current hardware. The programming area is built on ScriptBlocks, a Javascript-based blocks library. StarLogo Nova is currently under development by the MIT Scheller Teacher Education Program, directed by Eric Klopfer, with lead designer/developer Daniel Wendel.

StarLogo Nova introduces several notable design changes relative to TNG, particularly with the introduction of a "World" agent, reminiscent of StarLogo 2.2's "Observer." In StarLogo Nova, any command can be run by any agent, but each "breed" has its own program and can have its own set of breed-specific "traits." This brings StarLogo Nova closer to an object-oriented design, in an effort to improve the ease with which students can transfer skills in StarLogo Nova to other, more mainstream languages. Other changes include the use of embedded arguments for blocks (similar to Scratch), WYSIWYG editing of the simulation interface, and splitting the collision primitive into its component halves, with each breed having collision code on its own program page.

'''Warwick James Rodwell''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (born 24 October 1946) is an archaeologist, architectural historian and academic. He is Visiting Professor in the Department of Archaeology, [[University of Reading]], and Consultant Archaeologist to [[Westminster Abbey]], where he is also a member of the [[Westminster School|College of St Peter in Westminster]]. He is the author of many books and articles, including the standard textbook on church archaeology (first published in 1981). He is a Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] and the [[Royal Historical Society]].

==Early life and education==
Warwick Rodwell was born in Essex on 24 October 1946, the only child of Thomas George Rodwell and his wife Olive Ellen (née Nottage). He attended the local grammar school, [[Southend High School for Boys]], and afterwards went to Loughborough College of Education (now [[Loughborough University]]), where he studied creative design and history and trained as a technology teacher (1965–68) and was awarded a Diploma of Loughborough College (DLC); the university subsequently awarded him the degree of BSc. After Loughborough he studied archaeology at the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology]] (now part of [[University College, London]]), graduating with a BA Honours in the archaeology of the Roman Provinces (1972). He then went to [[Worcester College, Oxford]], and carried out research for a thesis, based at the Institute of Archaeology (part of the School of Archaeology, University of Oxford), on "Settlement and Economy in the Territory of the Trinovantes, ''c'' 500 BC to AD 50", for which he received a DPhil (1976). He also has an MA degree awarded for a thesis at the School of History, [[University of Birmingham]] (1979). In recognition of his publications, he was awarded the degrees of DLitt (University of Oxford, 1992) and DLit (University of London, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reading.ac.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.asp?lID=34750&amp;sID=141670 University of Reading Staff]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Rodwell excavated a number of prehistoric, Roman, Anglo-Saxon and medieval sites in Essex and Eastern England during the 1960s and 1970s, including Asheldham, Hadstock, Kelvedon, Rivenhall and Wickford. In 1975 he was appointed as the first director of the professional archaeological unit covering the counties of Avon, Gloucestershire and Somerset&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba26/BA26INT.HTML Interview with Warwick Rodwell in ''British Archaeology'']&lt;/ref&gt; and led a major campaign of excavations and structural recording at Wells Cathedral (1978–93). In 1981 he set up in private practice as a consultant archaeologist and architectural historian, specialising in the investigation, recording and analysis of Anglo-Saxon and medieval churches and cathedrals and major secular buildings of medieval and later date, including castles, palaces and country houses. His listed long-term consultancies include: [[Glastonbury Abbey]] (1976–2005), [[Bristol Cathedral]] (1976–2010), [[Wells Cathedral]] (since 1977), [[Lichfield Cathedral]] (1982–2009) and [[Westminster Abbey]] (since 2004).&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who 2011''&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a member of the Council for the Care of Churches (now the Church Buildings Council, Church of England) (1976–86); a commissioner of the Cathedrals Advisory Commission (1981–90) and the Cathedrals Fabric Commission for England (1991–96); a member of Salisbury Cathedral Fabric Advisory Committee (1987–2006); a member of Exeter Cathedral Fabric Advisory Committee (1999–2006); a trustee of the Bath Archaeological Trust (1976–2005); and President of the [[Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society]] (1999–2000).

He was elected as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1965, and the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sal.org.uk/history/listoffellows/?letter=R List of fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 he was awarded the latter Society's Frend Medal for distinguished service to church archaeology. In 1992 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, and in 1998 was made a Membre d'Honneur of La Société Jersiaise in recognition of his services to the archaeology of Jersey. Since 2002 he has been Visiting Professor in the Department of Archaeology at the [[University of Reading]]. In 2008 he was appointed as a member of the College of St Peter in Westminster, and is the first holder of the stall designated ''Archaeologus'' in the quire of Westminster Abbey.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Warwick Rodwell, in ''The London Archaeologist'' '''12/8''' (2010), 220–2.&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed OBE in 2009 for services to ecclesiastical archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/8097850.stm BBC news]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodwell has studied a number of major ecclesiastical buildings, including [[Westminster Abbey]], [[Wells Cathedral]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Archaeology of Wells Cathedral: Excavations and Structural Studies, 1978–93.''

[[File:Launchbottle.jpg|thumb|right|Water rocket launch]]
A '''water rocket''' is a type of [[model rocket]] using [[water]] as its [[reaction mass]]. The water is forced out by a pressurized gas, typically [[compressed air]]. Like all [[rocket engine]]s, it operates on the principle of [[Newton's third law|Newton's third law of motion]]. Water rocket hobbyists typically use one or more plastic [[soft drink]] bottle as the rocket's pressure vessel. A variety of designs are possible including multi-stage rockets. Water rockets are also custom-built from composite materials to achieve world record altitudes.

== Operation ==
[[File:Water rocket.gif|thumb|left|Simplified animation of how a water rocket works. 1) A bubble of compressed air is added and pressurizes the contents of the bottle. 2) The bottle is released from the pump. 3) The water is pushed out through the nozzle by the compressed air. 4) The bottle moves away from the water because it follows Newton's Third Law.]]
The bottle is partly filled with water and sealed. The bottle is then pressurized with a gas, usually air compressed from a [[bicycle pump]], [[air compressor]], or cylinder up to 125 psi, but sometimes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or [[nitrogen]] from a cylinder.
[[File:WaterRocketLaunch.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Launch of a bottle without nose cone or fins.]]
[[File:WaterRocket.JPG|thumb|right|Launching a water rocket. The rocket is in its peak with no water inside it.]]

Water and gas are used in combination, with the gas providing a means to store energy, as it is compressible, and the water increasing the [[propellant mass fraction]] and providing greater force  when ejected from the rocket's nozzle. Sometimes additives are combined with the water to enhance performance in different ways. For example: salt can be added to increase the density of the reaction mass resulting in a higher [[specific impulse]]. Soap is also sometimes used to create a dense foam in the rocket which lowers the density of the expelled reaction mass but increases the duration of thrust.

The seal on the nozzle of the rocket is then released and rapid expulsion of water occurs at high speeds until the propellant has been used up and the air pressure inside the rocket drops to atmospheric pressure. There is a net force created on the rocket in accordance with [[Newton's third law]]. The expulsion of the water thus can cause the rocket to leap a considerable distance into the air.

In addition to aerodynamic considerations, altitude and flight duration are dependent upon the volume of water, the initial pressure, the rocket [[nozzle]]'s size, and the unloaded weight of the rocket. The relationship between these factors is complex and several simulators have been written to explore these and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/BottleRocket/sim.htm Water Rocket Computer Model] from [[NASA]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.et.byu.edu/~wheeler/benchtop/sim.php Sim Water Rocket] from Dean's Benchtop&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the pressure vessel is built from one or more used plastic soft drink bottles, but polycarbonate fluorescent tube covers, plastic pipes, and other light-weight pressure-resistant cylindrical vessels have also been used.

==Elements==

===Bottle===
[[File:Two Rockets.JPG|thumb|right|Two multi-bottle rockets with a [[cat]] for scale.]]
[[File:ethereal.JPG|thumb|right|A larger multi bottle rocket with cylindrical fins.]]

Typically a single [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET) carbonated [[soft drink]] bottle serves as the pressure vessel. Multi-bottle rockets are created by joining two or more bottles in any of several different ways; bottles can be connected via their nozzles, by cutting them apart and sliding the sections over each other, or by connecting them opening to bottom, making a chain to increase [[volume]]. This adds complexity and the increased volume leads to increased weight - but this should be offset by an increase in the duration of the [[thrust]] of the rocket.

Multi-stage rockets are much more complicated. They involve two or more rockets stacked on top of each other, designed to launch while in the air, much like the [[Multistage rocket|multi-stage rockets]] that are used to send payloads into space.

===Gas===
Several methods for pressurizing a water rocket are used including:
* A standard bicycle/car tire pump, capable of reaching at least {{convert|75|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}.
* Water pressure forcing all the air in an empty water hose into the rocket. Pressure is the same as the water main.
* An air compressor, like those used in workshops to power [[pneumatics|pneumatic]] equipment and tools. Modifying a high pressure (greater than 15 bar / 1500 kPa / 200 psi) compressor to work as a water rocket power source can be dangerous, as can using high-pressure gases from cylinders.
* Compressed gases in bottles, like [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), air, and [[nitrogen|nitrogen gas]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Examples include CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in [[paintball]] cylinders and air in industrial and SCUBA cylinders. Care must be taken with bottled gases: as the compressed gas expands, it cools (see [[gas laws]]) and rocket components cool as well. Some materials, such as [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] and [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]], can become brittle and weak when severely cooled. Long air hoses are used to maintain a safe distance, and pressure gauges (known as [[manometer]]s) and [[safety valve]]s are typically utilized on launcher installations to avoid over-pressurizing rockets and having them explode before they can be launched. Highly pressurized gases such as those in diving cylinders or vessels from industrial gas suppliers should only be used by trained operators, and the gas should be delivered to the rocket via a regulator device (e.g. a SCUBA first-stage). All compressed gas containers are subject to local, state and national laws in most countries and must be safety tested periodically by a certified test center.
* Sublimating carbon dioxide gas from dry ice. Dry ice expands 800 times in volume upon sublimation. A #3 rubber stopper is forcefully inserted into the neck of a two-liter [[plastic bottle]] partially filled with water. The pressure builds up enough to pop the stopper out.
* Ignition of a mixture of explosive gases above the water in the bottle; the explosion creates the pressure to launch the rocket into the air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.et.byu.edu/~wheeler/benchtop/hydropyro.php Dean's benchtop: hydrogen powered water rocket]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nozzles===
Water rocket nozzles differ from conventional combustion rocket nozzles in that they do not have a divergent section such as in a [[De Laval nozzle]]. Because water is essentially incompressible the divergent section does not contribute to efficiency and actually can make performance worse.

There are two main classes of water rocket nozzles:

* '''Open''' also sometimes referred to as "standard" or "full-bore" having an inside diameter of ~22mm which is the standard soda bottle neck opening.
* '''Restricted''' which is anything smaller than the "standard". A popular restricted nozzle has an inside diameter of 9mm and is known as a "Gardena nozzle" named after a common garden hose quick connector used to make them.

The size of the nozzle affects the thrust produced by the rocket. Larger diameter nozzles provide faster acceleration with a shorter thrust phase, while smaller nozzles provide lower acceleration with a longer thrust phase.

===Fins===
As the propellant level in the rocket goes down, the [[center of mass]] initially moves downwards before finally moving upwards again as the propellant is depleted.  This initial movement reduces stability and can  cause water rockets to start tumbling end over end, greatly decreasing the maximum speed and thus the length of glide (time that the rocket is flying under its own momentum).

To lower the [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]] and add stability, fins or other [[Stabilizer (aircraft)|stabilizer]]s can be added which bring the center of drag further back, well behind the center of mass at all times. Stabilizers of any sort are normally placed near the back of the bottle where the center of mass is found. The increase in stability which well-designed fins give is worth the extra drag, and helps to maximize the height to which the rocket will fly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/rktstab.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landing systems===

Stabilizing fins cause the rocket to fly nose-first which will give significantly higher speed, but they will also cause it to fall with a significantly higher velocity than it would if it tumbled to the ground, and this may damage the rocket or whomever or whatever it strikes upon landing.

Some water rockets have [[parachute]] or other recovery system to help prevent problems. However these systems can suffer from malfunctions. This is often taken into account when designing rockets. Rubber [[wikt:bumper|bumpers]], [[Crumple zone]]s, and safe launch practices can be utilized to minimize damage or injury caused by a falling rocket.

Another possible recovery system involves simply using the rocket's fins to slow its descent and is sometimes called ''backward sliding''. By increasing fin size, more drag is generated. If the center of mass is placed forward of the fins, the rocket will nose dive. In the case of super-roc or back-gliding rockets, the rocket is designed such that the relationship between center of gravity and the center of pressure of the empty rocket causes the fin-induced tendency of the rocket to tip nose down to be counteracted by the air resistance of the long body which would cause it to fall tail down, and resulting in the rocket falling sideways, slowly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lunar.org/docs/LUNARclips/v9/v9n4/superroc.shtml "Super Roc Rocket Gliders"], 2002, LUNAR.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Launch tubes===
Some water rocket launchers use launch tubes. A launch tube fits inside the nozzle of the rocket and extends upward toward the nose. The launch tube is anchored to the ground. As the rocket begins accelerating upward, the launch tube blocks the nozzle, and very little water is ejected until the rocket leaves the launch tube. This allows almost perfectly efficient conversion of the potential energy in the compressed air to kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy of the rocket and water. The high efficiency during the initial phase of the launch is important, because rocket engines are least efficient at low speeds. A launch tube therefore significantly increases the speed and height attained by the rocket. Launch tubes are most effective when used with long rockets, which can accommodate long launch tubes.

==Competitions==
The Water Rocket Achievement World Record Association&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wra2.org/WRA2_Competitions.php Water Rocket Achievement World Record Association]&lt;/ref&gt; is a worldwide association which administrates competitions for altitude records involving single-stage and multiple-stage water rockets, a flight duration competition, and speed or distance competitions for water rocket–powered cars.

Many local competitions of various sorts are held, including:

* In Scotland, the Oscar Swigelhoffer Trophy is an Aquajet (Water Rocket) competition held at the Annual International Rocket Week&lt;ref&gt;[http://irw.rocketry.org.uk Annual International Rocket Week]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Largs]] or nearby [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], and organized by STAAR Research&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gbnet.net/orgs/staar/Welcome.html STAAR Research]&lt;/ref&gt; through John Bonsor. The competition goes back to the mid-1980s, organized by the Paisley Rocketeers who have been active in amateur rocketry since the 1930s. The trophy is named after the late founder of ASTRA,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astra.org.uk ASTRA]&lt;/ref&gt; Oscar Swiglehoffer, who was also a personal friend and student of [[Hermann Oberth]], one of the founding fathers of rocketry. The competition involves team distance flying of water rockets under an agreed pressure and angle of flight. Each team consists of six rockets, which are flown in two flights. The greater distance for each rocket over the two flights is recorded, and the final team distances are collated, with the winning team having the greatest distance. The winner in 2007 was ASTRA.
* In the [[United Kingdom]], the largest water rocket competition is currently the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory's]] annual Water Rocket Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npl.co.uk/waterrockets/ National Physical Laboratory's annual Water Rocket Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOnH1fqI0nY&amp;list=PLCBB4A4F106726198&amp;index=8/ Playlist]&lt;/ref&gt; The competition was first opened to the public in 2001 and is limited to around 60 teams. It has schools and open categories, and is attended by a variety of "works" and private teams, some travelling from abroad. The rules and goals of the competition vary from year to year.
* In [[Germany]], the oldest and most popular water rocket competition is the Freestyle-Physics Water Rocket Competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fkpme246a.uni-duisburg.de/fsp-local/2006/rueckschau.shtml Freestyle-Physics Water Rocket Competition]&lt;/ref&gt; (&lt;ref&gt;[http://fkpme246a.uni-duisburg.de/wp/was-ist-freestyle-physics/downloadbereich/ Rangliste Wasserraketen]&lt;/ref&gt;) The competition is one part of a larger part of a student physics competition, where students are tasked to construct various machines and enter them in competitive contests.
* In the [[United States]], the [[Science Olympiad]] also runs water rocket event for elementary school age contestants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.soinc.org/sample_k6_events#water https://www.soinc.org/sample_k6_events#water]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Pakistan]] a water rocket competition  is held every year in [[World Space Week]] by [[Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission|Suparco]] Institute Of Technical Training (SITT) in which different schools from all over the Pakistan take part.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzQOGZiHoEQ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Ukraine]], a Water Rocket Competition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Фестиваль "Еко-техно-Патріо" E|url = http://ueeu.in.ua/un/festival.html|website = ueeu.in.ua|first = Zahoruiko|last = Oleksandr}}&lt;/ref&gt; is held every year in the Center for Innovative Technology in Education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Центр інноваційних технологій освіти  |url =http://ueeu.in.ua/CITE.html|website = ueeu.in.ua|first = Загоруйко|last = Александр}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CITE). and schools from all over the Ukraine take part.

== Biography ==
Péclard studied at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]] with [[André Navarra]], [[Joseph Calvet]], [[Jacques Février]] and [[Jean Hubeau]]. There he obtained the [[First Prize (music diploma)|First prizes]] of [[cello]] and [[chamber music]]. 

The winner of the international competitions of Vienna, Munich and Barcelona, from 1977 to 1990, Péclard was solo cellist of the [[Orchestre philharmonique de Radio France]], then of the [[Orchestre de Paris]], under the direction of [[Daniel Barenboim]]. Named solo cellist of the [[Orchestre National Bordeaux Aquitaine]] (ONBA) in 1990, he taught at the [[Conservatoire de Bordeaux]] and joined Roland Daugareil and [[Tasso Adamopoulos]] in order to form the Sartory Trio. He is also a member of the String quartet of the ONBA.

With the ONBA, directed by [[Alain Lombard]], Étienne Péclard recorded the ''[[Double Concerto (Brahms)|double concerto]]'' by [[Johannes Brahms]], the ''Symphonie-concerto, Op. 125'' by [[Sergueï Prokofiev]] and ''[[Schelomo]]'' by [[Ernest Bloch]]; in 1999, he obtained a great success with his interpretation of ''[[Tout un monde lointain...]]'' by [[Henri Dutilleux]], directed by [[Hans Graf]]. In November 2003, he performed the concerto by [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]] under the baton of his friend [[Frédéric Lodéon]]. In June 2005 he met again his accomplice Tasso Adamopoulos for ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quichotte]]'', [[Symphonic poem]] by [[Richard Strauss]], with the ONBA directed by [[Armin Jordan]].
