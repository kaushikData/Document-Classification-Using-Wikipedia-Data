'''Abdullah ibn Salam''' ({{lang-ar|'''عبدالله بن سلام'''}} ''God's servant, the Son of Peace''), born '''Al-Husayn ibn Salam''', was a [[sahaba|companion]] of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], and was a top [[rabbi]] before converting to [[Islam]]. He participated in the conquest of [[Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], but died in [[Medina]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
Abdullah ibn Salam was a [[Jewish]] rabbi in [[Yathrib]] who belonged to the [[Banu Qaynuqa]] tribe, claiming descent from Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/190-abdallah-ibn-salam " He belonged to the tribe of the Banu Ḳainuḳa'a. His name was Al-Husain, and he claimed to be a descendant of Joseph.&lt;/ref&gt; He was widely respected and honored by the people of the city, even those who were not Jewish. For a fixed period each day, he would [[worship]], [[teaching|teach]] and [[preach]] in the [[Synagogue]]. He was known for his piety and goodness, his upright conduct, and his truthfulness.

Abdullah ibn Salam lived a peaceful and gentle life but he was serious, purposeful and organized in the way he spent his time. For a fixed period each day, he would worship, teach and preach in the synagogue.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Then he would spend some time in his orchard, looking after date palms, pruning and pollinating.  Thereafter, to increase his understanding and knowledge of his religion, he would devote himself to the study of the Torah.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In this study, it is said he was particularly struck by some verses of the Torah which dealt with the coming of a prophet who would complete the message of previous prophets. Abdullah ibn Salam therefore took an immediate and keen interest when he heard reports of the appearance of a prophet in Mecca. He used to stop at certain passages in the Torah and ponder a long time upon the news therein of the prophet who was to appear to complete the Message of all the prophets before him. The more he read the more he became convinced that the foretold prophet was Muhammad who appeared among his people in Mecca.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Conversion of Abdullah===
In 622, Muhammad left [[Mecca]] for [[Medina]]. When he reached Medina and stopped at [[Quba]], a man came rushing into the city, calling out to people and announcing the arrival of Muhammad. On hearing the news, Abdullah ibn Salam exclaimed the Shahadah (Testimony of faith that there is only one God and Muhammad is His Messenger) and told his aunt, who was sitting nearby: "Aunt, he is really, by God, the brother of [[Moses]] and follows his religion...".&lt;ref&gt;''Hughes Dictionary of Islam'', ''Abdullah Ibn Salam'': "She was silent for a while and then said: 'Is he the Prophet about whom you spoke to us who would be sent to confirm the truth preached by previous (prophets) and complete the message of his Lord?' 'Yes,' I replied."&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition recounts Abdullah's early life in his own words:&lt;blockquote&gt;"When I heard of the appearance of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) I began to make enquiries about his name, his genealogy, his characteristics, his time and place and I began to compare this information with what is contained in our books. From these enquiries, I became convinced about the authenticity of his prophethood and I affirmed the truth of his mission.  However, I concealed my conclusions from the Jews.  I held my tongue.

Then came the day when the Prophet, peace be upon him, left Makkah and headed for Yathrib.  When he reached Yathrib and stopped at Quba, a man came rushing into the city, calling out to people and announcing the arrival of the Prophet.

At that moment, I was at the top of a palm tree doing some work.  My aunt, Khalidah bint Al-Harith, was sitting under the tree.  On hearing the news, I shouted: “Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!” (God is Great! God is Great!)

When my aunt heard me, she remonstrated with me: “May God frustrate you...  By God, if you had heard that Moses was coming you would not have been more enthusiastic.”

“Auntie, he is really, by God, the ‘brother’ of Moses and follows his religion.  He was sent with the same mission as Moses.” She was silent for a while and then said: “Is he the Prophet about whom you spoke to us who would be sent to confirm the truth preached by previous (Prophets) and complete the message of his Lord?”

“Yes,” I replied. Without any delay or hesitation, Abdullah went out to meet the Prophet. He saw crowds of people at his door. I moved about in the crowds until I reached close to him. The first words I heard him say were: 'O people! Spread peace...Share food...Pray during the night while people sleep... and you will enter Paradise in peace...' I looked at him closely. I scrutinized him and was convinced that his face was not that of an imposter. I went closer to him and made the declaration of faith that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God. The Prophet turned to me and asked: 'What is your name?' 'Al-Husayn ibn Salam,' I replied. 'Instead, it is (now) Abdullah ibn Salam,' he said (giving me a new name). 'Yes,' I agreed. 'Abdullah ibn Salam (it shall be). By Him who has sent you with the Truth, I do not wish to have another name after this day.' I returned home and introduced Islam to my wife, my children and the rest of my household.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In the Qur'an===
The Qur'an implicitly mentions Abdullah ibn Salam, "Say, 'Have you considered: if the Qur'an was from Allah, and you disbelieved in it while a witness from the Children of Israel has testified to something similar and believed while you were arrogant?' Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people" (Qur'an, 46:10). [[Tafsir al-Jalalayn]] mentions in its exegesis of this verse that the "witness" in the verse refers to Abdullah ibn Salam.

===Promise to Abdullah===
Abdullah ibn Salam was the first [[Muslim]] that was promised Paradise while he was still alive. In a ''[[Hadith]]'', it was reported that one day while Muhammad was sitting with the best of his companions, he said "Do you want to see a man walking on Earth and in Paradise?" Each one of the companions looked in silence towards Muhammad hoping he would mention their name. Muhammad pointed in the distance and the companions saw he was looking towards Abdullah ibn Salam.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Non Muslim view==
Although some Muslim sources claim that he converted immediately after Muhammad’s arrival to Medina,&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Ishaq. ''Sirat Rasul Allah''.
 Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). ''The Life of Muhammad'', pp. 240-241. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; non-Muslim scholars give more credence to to some later years .

He died in 663.

'''Adurfrazgird''' was [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] prince, who served as the governor of [[Nisibis]] under his brother [[Shapur II]] (r. 309-379). His name is derived from the [[Avestan]] {{transl|ae|frašō.kərəti}}, "Having the furtherance of Fire".

According to the Syriac Acts of the Persian Martyrs, the western frontier province of  [[Arbayistan]] was divided in the 360s between Adurfrazgird and his brother Zamasp−Adurfrazgird governing Nisibis whilst Zamasp governed a area along the [[Tigris river]]. The two brothers were to keep an eye for each other and Roman activities. Zamasp was notably noted for his persecution of Christians.

'''Anselperga''' was the eldest daughter of [[Desiderius]], [[King of the Lombards]], and [[Ansa (queen)|Ansa]]. She was the second [[San Salvatore monastery|Abbess of San Salvatore e Santa Giulia]], which her parents had formed in [[Brescia]] from the union of San Michele e San Pietro with San Salvatore e Santa Maria. 

Anselperga was richly endowed with land. She received donations from her father, mother, brother [[Adelchis]], and her maternal relatives. During her tenure San Salvatore was removed by her father from the jurisdiction of the [[Patriarch of Aquileia]] and given to the [[Archbishop of Milan]]. Nevertheless, on 13 October 772, Anselperga received a privilege from Patriarch [[Sigwald]]. The date of Anselperga's death is unrecorded, but she was replaced by [[Radoara]] as early as 781.

'''Astroinformatics''' is an interdisciplinary field of study involving the combination of [[astronomy]], [[data science]], [[informatics]], and [[Information technology|information]]/[[Communications technologies|communications]] technologies.&lt;ref name="astroinfo" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pdf&gt;[http://www.math.bas.bg/~nkirov/zip/SEEDI_astro_presentation.pdf Astroinformatics and digitization of astronomical heritage], Nikolay Kirov. The fifth SEEDI International Conference Digitization of cultural and scientific heritage, May 19–20, 2010, Sarajevo. Retrieved 1 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Astroinformatics is primarily focused on developing the tools, methods, and applications of [[computational science]], [[data science]], and [[statistics]] for research and education in data-oriented astronomy.&lt;ref name="astroinfo"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borne |first1=Kirk D. |title=Astroinformatics: data-oriented astronomy research and education |journal=Earth Science Informatics |date=12 May 2010 |volume=3 |issue=1–2 |pages=5–17 |doi=10.1007/s12145-010-0055-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early efforts in this direction included [[data exploration|data discovery]], [[metadata standards]] development, [[data modeling]], astronomical [[data dictionary]] development, [[data access]], [[information retrieval]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Science User Scenarios for a Virtual Observatory Design Reference Mission: Science Requirements for Data Mining|eprint=astro-ph/0008307|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[data integration]], and [[data mining]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Kargupta |editor-first1=Hillol |display-editors=etal |title=Next generation of data mining |date=2008 |location=London |isbn=9781420085860 |last1=Borne |first1=Kirk|chapter=Scientific Data Mining in Astronomy |publisher=CRC Press |pages=91–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the astronomical [[Virtual Observatory]] initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1117/12.487536|chapter=Distributed data mining in the National Virtual Observatory|title=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery: Theory, Tools, and Technology V|volume=5098|pages=211|series=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery: Theory, Tools, and Technology V|year=2003|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VOdm" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laurino |first1=O. |last2=D’Abrusco |first2=R. |last3=Longo |first3=G. |last4=Riccio |first4=G. |title=Astroinformatics of galaxies and quasars: a new general method for photometric redshifts estimation |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |date=21 December 2011 |volume=418 |issue=4 |pages=2165–2195 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.19416.x|arxiv=1107.3160 |bibcode=2011MNRAS.418.2165L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further development of the field, along with astronomy community endorsement, was presented to the [[National Research Council (United States)]] in 2009 in the Astroinformatics "State of the Profession" Position Paper for the 2010 [[Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Astroinformatics: A 21st Century Approach to Astronomy|eprint = 0909.3892 |class=astro-ph.IM|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That position paper provided the basis for the subsequent more detailed exposition of the field in the Informatics Journal paper ''Astroinformatics: Data-Oriented Astronomy Research and Education''.&lt;ref name="astroinfo" /&gt;

Astroinformatics as a distinct field of research was inspired by work in the fields of [[Bioinformatics]] and [[Geoinformatics]], and through the [[eScience]] work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Online Science'|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gray/JimGrayTalks.htm|website=Talks by Jim Gray|publisher=Microsoft Research|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)]] at [[Microsoft Research]], whose legacy was remembered and continued through the Jim Gray eScience Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Gray eScience Award|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/focus/escience/jim-gray-award.aspx|website=Microsoft Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the primary focus of Astroinformatics is on the large worldwide distributed collection of digital astronomical databases, image archives, and research tools, the field recognizes the importance of legacy data sets as well—using modern technologies to preserve and analyze historical astronomical observations. Some Astroinformatics practitioners help to [[Digital data|digitize]] historical and recent astronomical observations and images in a large [[database]] for efficient retrieval through [[World wide web|web]]-based interfaces.&lt;ref name=pdf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casca.ca/lrp2010/Docs/LRPReports/astroinformatics_lrp.pdf Astroinformatics in Canada], Nicholas M. Ball, David Schade. Retrieved 1 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Another aim is to help develop new methods and software for astronomers, as well as to help facilitate the process and analysis of the rapidly growing amount of data in the field of astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Astroinformatics' helps Astronomers explore the sky|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-10-astroinformatics-astronomers-exploring-sky.html|website=Phys.org|publisher=Heidelberg University|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astroinformatics is described as the "Fourth Paradigm" of astronomical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fourth Paradigm: Data-Intensive Scientific Discovery|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/fourth-paradigm-data-intensive-scientific-discovery/|website=Microsoft Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many research areas involved with astroinformatics, such as data mining, machine learning, statistics, visualization, scientific data management, and semantic science.&lt;ref name="VOdm"&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5618-2_9|chapter=Virtual Observatories, Data Mining, and Astroinformatics|title=Planets, Stars and Stellar Systems|pages=403|year=2013|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|isbn=978-94-007-5617-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Data mining]] and [[machine learning]] play significant roles in Astroinformatics as a [[Scientific method|scientific research]] discipline due to their focus on "knowledge discovery from data" ([[data mining|KDD]]) and "learning from data".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ball |first1=N.M. |last2=Brunner |first2=R.J. |title=Data Mining and Machine Learning in Astronomy |journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D |volume=19 |issue=7 |pages=1049 |doi=10.1142/S0218271810017160 |year=2010|arxiv=0906.2173 |bibcode=2010IJMPD..19.1049B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1063/1.3059074 |chapter=The LSST Data Mining Research Agenda |title=AIP Conference Proceedings |pages=347 |year=2008 |last1=Borne |first1=K |last2=Becla |first2=J |last3=Davidson |first3=I |last4=Szalay |first4=A |last5=Tyson |first5=J.

The amount of data collected from astronomical sky surveys has grown from gigabytes to terabytes throughout the past decade and is predicted to grow in the next decade into hundreds of petabytes with the [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope]] and into the exabytes with the [[Square Kilometre Array]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1063/1.3059076|chapter=Parametrization and Classification of 20 Billion LSST Objects: Lessons from SDSS|title=AIP Conference Proceedings|pages=359|year=2008|last1=Ivezić|first1=Ž|last2=Axelrod|first2=T|last3=Becker|first3=A.

In part due to this, data-driven science is becoming a recognized academic discipline. Consequently, astronomy (and other scientific disciplines) are developing information-intensive and data-intensive sub-disciplines to an extent that these sub-disciplines are now becoming (or have already become) standalone research disciplines and full-fledged academic programs. While many institutes of education do not boast an astroinformatics program, such programs most likely will be developed in the near future.

[[Informatics]] has been recently defined as "the use of digital data, information, and related services for research and knowledge generation". However the usual, or commonly used definition is "informatics is the discipline of organizing, accessing, integrating, and mining data from multiple sources for discovery and decision support." Therefore, the discipline of astroinformatics includes many naturally-related specialties including data modeling, data organization, etc. It may also include transformation and normalization methods for data integration and information visualization, as well as knowledge extraction, indexing techniques, information retrieval and data mining methods. Classification schemes (e.g., [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]], [[ontology (information science)|ontologies]], [[folksonomy|folksonomies]], and/or collaborative [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Collaborative Annotation for Scientific Data Discovery and Reuse|url=http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Apr-13/AprMay13_RDAP_Borne.html|website=Bulletin of the ASIS&amp;T|publisher=American Society for Information Science and Technology|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) plus [[Astrostatistics]] will also be heavily involved. [[Citizen science]] projects (such as [[Galaxy Zoo]]) also contribute highly valued novelty discovery, feature meta-tagging, and object characterization within large astronomy data sets. All of these specialties enable scientific discovery across varied massive data collections, collaborative research, and data re-use, in both research and learning environments.

In 2012, two position papers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Astroinformatics in a Nutshell|url=https://asaip.psu.edu/Articles/astroinformatics-in-a-nutshell|website=asaip.psu.edu|publisher=The Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal, Penn State University|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feigelson|first1=Eric|title=Astrostatistics in a Nutshell|url=https://asaip.psu.edu/Articles/astrostatistics-in-a-nutshell|website=asaip.psu.edu|publisher=The Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal, Penn State University|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; were presented to the Council of the [[American Astronomical Society]] that led to the establishment of formal working groups in Astroinformatics and [[Astrostatistics]] for the profession of [[astronomy]] within the US and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Feigelson|first1=E.|last2=Ivezić|first2=Ž.|last3=Hilbe|first3=J.|last4=Borne|first4=K.|title=New Organizations to Support Astroinformatics and Astrostatistics|eprint=1301.3069|class=astro-ph.IM|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astroinformatics provides a natural context for the integration of education and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=The Revolution in Astronomy Education: Data Science for the Masses|eprint = 0909.3895 |class=astro-ph.IM|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of research can now be implemented within the classroom to establish and grow [[data literacy]] through the easy re-use of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Data in the Classroom|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/usingdata/index.html|website=Science Education Resource Center at Carleton College|publisher=National Science Digital Library|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has many other uses, such as repurposing archival data for new projects, literature-data links, intelligent retrieval of information, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Astroinformatics: Data-Oriented Astronomy|location=George Mason University, USA|url=http://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2009/PosterPapers/Poster-paper18.pdf|accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bert''' (born 1934) was one of the most influential sires in the early years of the [[American Quarter Horse Association]] (AQHA).&lt;ref name=Simmons&gt;Simmons ''Legends'' p. 115-116&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Foaled on March 24, 1934&lt;ref name=Sires&gt;Nye ''Outstanding Modern Quarter Horse Sires'' p. 144-148&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], Bert was registered as number 227 with the AQHA.&lt;ref name=StudBook&gt;American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) ''Official Stud Book'' p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; His registration entry gives his breeder as Bert Benear of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] and his color as brown.&lt;ref name=StudBook/&gt; His sire, Tommy Clegg was a descendant of [[Peter McCue (horse)|Peter McCue]] while his dam, Mayflower,  was descended from both Yellow Jacket and Yellow Wolf.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/bert Pedigree Pedigree of Bert]" ''All Breed Pedigree Database''&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Coolidge was a [[dun]] mare foaled in 1928, bred by Mike Beetch of [[Lawton, Oklahoma]]. Her dam was a [[Match race|match racing]] mare with a time of eleven seconds for the 220 yards. Bert's sire was used on the Benear ranch as a cowhorse before he was sold to Howard Martin.&lt;ref name=Sires/&gt; 

Bert was bought as a [[Colt (horse)|colt]] by Bob Weimer of [[Council Hill, Oklahoma]] who named his new purchase after the colt's breeder. Bert was broke as a three-year-old, but before he could start on a riding career, he injured himself in barbed wire, almost cutting his right front foot off. After a recovery lasting months, Bert was sound, but his owner did not feel that it was safe to work him hard, as the colt had been purchased mainly as a breeding stallion prospect. In his prime, he stood {{hands|14.3}} high and weighed close to 1150 pounds. Weimer claimed that he could "turn him out in the morning with the mares and drive out in the pasture in the evening with the pick-up and he will come to me as quick as I call him."&lt;ref name=Sires/&gt;

Bert sired [[racehorse]]s, [[Team Roping|roping]] horses, and all around ranch horses. He was the sire of eleven race starters, all of whom earned an AQHA Race Register of Merit.&lt;ref name=Digest&gt;Wagoner ''Quarter Racing Digest'' p. 95-96&lt;/ref&gt; His foal who earned the most money on the racetrack was V's Bert, who earned $2777 from forty-eight starts with five wins, twelve seconds and five thirds in six years of racing.&lt;ref name=Digest/&gt; He sired four AQHA Champions, as well as Superior Halter horses and Superior Performance horses.&lt;ref&gt;Pitzer ''The Most Influential Quarter Horse Sires'' p. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Jeanne's Patsy was the 1955 AQHA High Point Roping horse.&lt;ref name=Complete77&gt;Nye ''The Complete Book of the Quarter Horse'' p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; His granddaughter [[Baby Doll Combs]] was a noted rodeo [[Steer wrestling|bulldogging]] mare&lt;ref name=Simmons/&gt; known as "Baby Doll" who was inducted into the [[ProRodeo Hall of Fame]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Baby Doll  |url=http://www.prorodeohalloffame.com/inductees/by-category/livestock/baby-doll/ |website=Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame |publisher=Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association |accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bert died in May 1956.&lt;ref name=Simmons/&gt;

Bert was inducted into the [[American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame|AQHA Hall of Fame]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bert |url=https://www.aqha.com/museum/hall-of-fame/horses/b/bert/ |work= AQHA Hall of Fame |author=American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) |publisher=American Quarter Horse Association |accessdate=August 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1677">'''Camille Alaphilippe''' (1874 – after 1934) was a [[France|French]] [[sculptor]].

Alaphilippe was born in [[Tours]] in 1874. At the age of 19, he was the pupil of [[Jean-Paul Laurens]] and [[Louis-Ernest Barrias]] to the [[École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts]] of [[Paris]].

In 1898, at 24, he won the first great [[Prix de Rome]] in sculpture with a statue on the subject ''Caïn après la mort d'Abel poursuivi par la vengeance céleste'' or ''Caïn après la mort d'Abel entend la malédiction de l'Éternel''.

He died in [[Algeria]] sometime after 1934.

{{nihongo|'''''Cyborg 009'''''|サイボーグゼロゼロナイン|Saibōgu Zero-Zero-Nain|lead=yes}} is a [[manga]] created by [[Shotaro Ishinomori]]. It was serialized in many different Japanese [[List of manga magazines|magazines]], including ''[[Shōnen Gahōsha|Monthly Shōnen King]]'', ''[[Weekly Shōnen Magazine]]'', ''[[Weekly Shōnen Big Comic|Shōnen Big Comic]]'', ''[[COM (manga magazine)|COM]]'', ''[[Shōjo Comic]]'', ''[[Weekly Shōnen Sunday]]'', ''[[Monthly Shōnen Jump]]'', and ''Monthly Comic Nora''. In 2012, [[comiXology]] acquired the digital distribution rights to Shotaro Ishinomori's catalogue, including ''Cyborg 009''.&lt;ref name="comiX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2012-10-12/comixology-licenses-shotaro-ishinomori-entire-manga-catalog |title=Comixology Licenses Shotaro Ishinomori's Entire Manga Catalog - News |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2012-10-12 |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shotaro Ishimori |url=https://www.comixology.com/Cyborg-009/comics-series/9119?ref=Y3JlYXRvci92aWV3L2Rlc2t0b3AvbGlzdC9jcmVhdG9yTGlzdA&amp;Issues_pg=1&amp;cu=0 |title=Cyborg 009 Digital Comics - Comics by comiXology |publisher=Comixology.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{More plot|1=section|date=January 2017}}
Nine people from around the world are kidnapped by the evil Black Ghost organization, led by its tyrannical leader Skull, to undergo experiments that would allow him to use them as human weapons to promote the production of cyborg warfare. While he succeeds in converting the group of nine into cyborgs with superhuman powers, his most reputable scientist, Dr. Isaac Gilmore, helps the cyborgs escape to rebel against Skull and his organization. The nine cyborgs (from which the name of the series is derived) band together in order to stop Black Ghost from achieving its goal of starting the next world war by supplying rich buyers with countless weapons of mass destruction. After the destruction of Black Ghost, the nine cyborgs go on to fight a variety of threats such as mad scientists, supernatural beings, and ancient civilizations.

==Media==
{{Overly detailed|section|date=January 2017}}
{{see also|List of Cyborg 009 media}}

===Manga===
The first arc was serialized in ''Weekly Shōnen King'' ([[Shōnen Gahosha]]). It depicts Cyborg 009's origin story, the escape from Black Ghost, and the group running from the cyborg assassins. It ended with the battle against the [[Mythos]] Cyborgs.

The second arc, called ''The Underground Empire Yomi Arc'', appeared in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Magazine]]'' ([[Kodansha]]) alongside the release of the film version. The story is highly influenced by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]' [[At the Earth's Core (novel)|''Earth's Core'' series]],{{Original research inline|date=August 2017}} including an expedition to the center of the Earth with a drill tank and a reptile race who can use telepathy and grow wings. The story ends with the final battle against Black Ghost. In the final scene, 009 and 002 fall into Earth's atmosphere and are seen as a shooting star by two small children, one of whom wishes for a toy gun and the other for world peace (a scene reminiscent of [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[The Illustrated Man|Kaleidoscope]]''). This point was the intended finale for the series; however, by popular demand, the producers wrote the two heroes to be rescued.{{Original research inline|date=February 2017}} As such, 001 was able to use his telekinetic powers at the last minute to retrieve 002 and 009 from their plummet before death.

The third arc, serialized in ''Monthly Bouken-oh'' (Adventure King) ([[Akita Shoten]]), contained 6 story arcs, including the Monster Island Arc, the Middle East Arc, and the Angels Arc. The series abruptly ended during the Angels Arc.

The fourth arc, called ''The Battle of the Gods Arc'', was serialized in ''[[COM (manga magazine)|COM]]'' ([[Mushi Production]]). Ishinomori resumed and retold the interrupted Angels Arc with a new plot, but the series once again ended abruptly. Ishinomori would not resume the series for a few years after this.

The fifth arc was serialized in ''[[Shōjo Comic]]'' ([[Shogakukan]]), and included the ''Wind City Arc'', the ''Snow Carnival Arc'', and the ''Edda Arc''. The story deals with legendary and mythical like characters challenging the 00 Number Cyborgs.

The sixth arc followed closely after the fifth arc. Arcs such as the ''Deinonychus Arc'' (appeared in ''[[Monthly Shōnen Jump]]'' ([[Shueisha]])) and ''Green Hole Arc'' (appeared in ''Play Comic'' ([[Akita Shoten]])) were depicted, then long after, the ''Underwater Pyramid Arc'' was serialized in ''Monthly Manga Shōnen'' ([[Asahi Sonorama]]).

The seventh arc was serialized in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Sunday]]'' ([[Shogakukan]]) alongside the revival anime. A long arc consisting of many short arcs, this series dealt with the battle against Neo Black Ghost as well as the emotional trauma of the 00 Number Cyborgs. The story is set approximately 20 years after the ''Yomi Arc'', and the personalities and conduct of the cyborgs are depicted as more adult.

The eighth arc was serialized in ''Monthly Comic Nora'' ([[Gakken]]). This longer arc was called ''People Drifting Through Time and Space Arc'', and is a sequel to the ''Immigration Arc''. The [[Count of St. Germain]] from the Underwater Pyramid Arc appears, but the design of his drawing is different. Ishinomori's death made this the last work of the series, although it is not the final chapter.{{Original research inline|date=February 2017}}

====Manga publication history====
The series was written and illustrated by [[Shotaro Ishinomori]], serialized in ''Monthly Shōnen King'', published in Japan by [[Akita Shoten]] and other companies through its history, and published in North America by [[Tokyopop]].

The Tokyopop release took multiple liberties with the dialogue and translation, and was sourced from the Media Factory "MF Comics" release that had been published in 2003.{{Original research inline|date=February 2017}} The MF Comics release had comprised 36 volumes, of which Tokyopop had only covered 10. Ishinomori's initial intent was to have the Yomi arc be the end of the series, but he continued the series due to the fan letters that urged him to resurrect 009 and 002.{{Original research inline|date=February 2017}}

Digital comics distributor [[comiXology]] licensed the entire catalogue from [[Ishimori Productions]] in 2012,&lt;ref name="comiX"/&gt; and has made the first 10 volumes of ''Cyborg 009'' available to the public.

In April 2012, Shogakukan announced that the ''Cyborg 009'' manga would conclude in ''Weekly Shōnen Sunday''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:クラブサンデー|url=http://club.shogakukan.co.jp/kod/c009cgw.html|publisher=Shogakukan|accessdate=7 April 2012|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entitled ''Cyborg 009 Conclusion: God's War'', the manga is to be illustrated by Masato Hayase and to be based on Ishinomori's original concept notes, sketches, and novel drafts, all of which had been gathered by his son, Jo Onodera. ''Conclusion'' is scheduled to debut on April 13, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyborg 009 Story Finale Made Into Manga Series|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-04-03/cyborg-009-story-finale-made-into-manga-series|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphic novel===
A full-color [[graphic novel]] based off the franchise was released at [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] on July 21, 2013 to align with the anniversary of Ishinomori's original manga. The book is a condensed retelling of the 00 Cyborgs' battle against Black Ghost, led by Sekar (Skull).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joyce |first=Nancy |url=http://whatchareading.com/2013/07/16/cyborg-009-graphic-novel-debut-at-sdcc/ |title=Cyborg 009 Graphic Novel Debut at SDCC! ~ What'cha Reading? |publisher=Whatchareading.com |date=2013-07-16 |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full release was on September 11, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://store.archaia.com/cyborg-009 |title = Cyborg 009 - Archaia Comics Store |website = www.archaia.com |accessdate = July 25, 2013 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130813035154/http://store.archaia.com/cyborg-009/ |archivedate = August 13, 2013 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The graphic novel is written by F.

The 2001 version aired on [[MBC 3 (Middle East)|MBC 3]] several times starting from 2005 and became extremely popular with [[Arab]] viewers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===North American releases===
The 1967 movie was released in Mexico, and years later, the 2001 television series aired on Toonami in 2003. The movie was later replayed on Cadena Tres in 2007, and was quite popular with Mexican viewers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The 1979 series was broadcast with English subtitles on Japanese-language television in Hawaii, California, and in the [[New York metropolitan area]]. The English subtitles were produced by San Francisco-based Fuji Television, which did not broadcast the series as part of its Japanese programming on [[KEMO-TV]].

The 1980 film was released in the United States in 1988 by Celebrity Home Entertainment as ''Defenders of the Vortex'', with an edited version of an English dub that was commissioned through the Tokyo, Japan-based Frontier Enterprises. It later received an unedited direct-to-video English release in 1995 by Best Film and Video Corporation with the full version of the same dub.

The 2001 TV series was licensed by Avex Inc. (the North American branch of Avex Mode, the 2001 series' original distributor in Japan) and dubbed into English by [[Animaze]] and ZRO Limit Productions. The entire series was dubbed, with the first 26 episodes shown on the [[Toonami]] programming block on [[Cartoon Network]], while episodes 27 to 47 were shown in a late-night block before the show was dropped from their lineup. The first 8 episodes were distributed on DVD by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment]] in a two-disc uncut bilingual set, as well as two dub-only edited broadcast volumes of four episodes each along with Portuguese and Spanish dubs. As of 2017, none of the other episodes have become available on home video outside Japan and Hong Kong, but [[Madman Entertainment]] released the first 26 dubbed episodes to DVD in Australia, however it is out of print. [[Discotek Media]] announced during their [[Otakon]] 2017 panel that they have licensed the 2001 series, and they will release the entire series, in the uncut bilingual version, on a SD[[Blu-ray Disc|BD]] set later in early 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discotek Licenses Cyborg 009 The Cyborg Soldier, Tomorrow's Joe, Project ARMS, NieA_7, Lupin III: The Legend of the Gold of Babylon|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-08-13/discotek-licenses-cyborg-009-the-cyborg-soldier-tomorrow-joe-project-arms-niea_7-lupin-iii-the-legend-of-the-gold-of-babylon/.120065|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=August 13, 2017|date=August 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose for this set is to restore the uncut version of the dub for the whole series to its best state possible, as well as the video quality.

The 2012 movie is licensed by [[FUNimation Entertainment]] (North America), [[Anime Limited]] (UK), and [[Madman Entertainment]] (Australia/New Zealand).

==Legacy==
In the ''[[Skull Man]]'' manga, Joe/009 makes an appearance in Chapter 36 in a chance meeting with Ryuusei Chisato, the Skull Man. Both discuss the nature of evil and humanity over coffee, and meet again by chance when the Skull Man stops a dirty deal by politicians on the docks. The 2007 ''[[Skull Man]]'' anime was set up as a prequel of ''Cyborg 009'', with many of the events in the series finale setting up for the pilot episode of ''Cyborg 009''. In the 1997 anime ''[[King of Braves GaoGaiGar]]'', the character Soldato J is a tribute to Jet Link/002, sharing his love of flight, acceleration modes, and his characteristic nose.{{Original research inline|date=January 2017}} Soldato J's number in the Corps to which he belongs is 002, further reinforcing this link.{{Original research inline|date=January 2017}} Shotaro Ishinomori later created ''[[Himitsu Sentai Goranger]]'' and ''[[J.A.K.Q. Dengekitai]]'', of which the latter series is especially similar to ''Cyborg 009'' in terms of characters and premise. The ''[[Mega Man]]'' video game character Proto Man is also visually inspired by ''Cyborg 009''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

'''''Eidothea hardeniana''''', commonly named '''nightcap oak''', is a species of [[tree]]s up to 40&amp;nbsp;m (130&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, of the plant family [[Proteaceae]], which [[botanist]] Robert Kooyman recognised as a new species only recently in 2000.&lt;ref name=Weston-Kooyman-2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=DEC-2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weston-Kooyman-2002-ASGAP/&gt; The species has an official listing as [[critically endangered]] on the Australian Commonwealth [[EPBC Act]] and as [[Endangered]] on the NSW Threatened Species Act.&lt;ref name=SPRAT/&gt;&lt;ref name=DEC-2004/&gt; The name ''hardeniana'' honours the botanist [[wikidata:Q21515490|Gwen Harden]]. Phylogenetics studies now suggest it represents a basal branch of the Proteoid clade of the Proteaceae.

==Distribution and habitat==
The trees are only known to grow naturally in a single creek catchment in warm temperate rainforest in the Nightcap Range, northern [[New South Wales]], Australia. They grow naturally in relatively poor, acidic volcanic soils, in an area of a high rainfall. Only around 100 wild plants are known.&lt;ref name=Weston-Kooyman-2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weston-Kooyman-2002-ASGAP/&gt;&lt;!-- citations for previous 3 sentences --&gt; Plants are in cultivation, including in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney.

==Description==
''Eidothea hardeniana'' trees have pale [[lichen]] covered bark typical of many species in the Warm Temperate Rainforests. Often a ring of coppice shoots surrounds the base of an adult tree, coppice and seedling leaves have spiny marginal teeth, while adult leaves have no teeth.&lt;ref name=Weston-Kooyman-2002/&gt;

Flowers are cream in clusters and smell of [[aniseed]].

Fruits are large and rounded with a yellow green skin and a hard nut inside.
The walls of the nut are ribbed, a feature unique to this genus in the family.
The seed has a white center and it probably contains poisonous cyanogenic compounds like some species of [[Macadamia]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} These toxins do not deter rodents from eating through the hard nut and devouring the seeds, limiting the regeneration of this plant.

==Refugee flows and escape attempts==
{{further|Republikflucht}}
Between 1945 and 1988, around 4 million East Germans migrated to the West. 3.454 million of them left between 1945 and the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961. The great majority simply walked across the border or, after 1952, exited through West Berlin. After the [[border barrier|border was fortified]] and the Berlin Wall was constructed, the number of illegal border crossings fell drastically. The numbers fell further as the border defenses were improved over the subsequent decades. In 1961, 8,507 people fled across the border, most of them through West Berlin. The construction of the Berlin Wall that year reduced the number of escapees by 75% to around 2,300 per annum for the rest of the decade. The Wall changed Berlin from being one of the easiest places to cross the border, from the East, to being one of the most difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Keeling, Drew (2014), [http://www.business-of-migration.com/migration-processes/other-regions/berlin-wall-and-migration/ "Berlin Wall and Migration," ''Migration as a travel business'']&lt;/ref&gt; The number of escapees fell further to 868 per annum during the 1970s and to only 334 per annum between 1980 and 1988. However, escapees were never more than a small minority of the total number of emigrants from East Germany. Far more people left the country after being granted official permits, by fleeing through third countries or by [[Crossing_the_inner_German_border#Ransoms_and_"humanitarian_releases"|being ransomed]] by the West German government. During the 1980s, only about 1% of those who left East Germany did so by escaping across the border.&lt;ref name="Jarausch-17"&gt;[[#Jarausch|Jarausch (1994)]], p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Escapees had various motives for attempting to flee East Germany. The vast majority had an essentially economic motive: they wished to improve their living conditions and opportunities in the West. Some fled for political reasons, but many were impelled to leave by specific social and political events. The imposition of collective agriculture and the crushing of the 1953 East German uprising prompted thousands to flee to the West, as did further coercive economic restructuring in 1960. Thousands of those who fled did so to escape the clearance of their villages along the border. By the 1980s, the number of escape attempts was rising again as East Germany's economy stagnated and living conditions deteriorated.&lt;ref name="Escapees-Eichsfeld"&gt;"The number of escapees". Grenzmuseum Eichsfeld&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to flee across the border were carefully studied and recorded by the East German authorities to identify possible weak points. These would be addressed by strengthening the fortifications in vulnerable areas. The [[East German Army]] (NPA) and the [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security]] (Stasi) carried out statistical surveys to identify trends. In one example, a study was carried out by the NPA at the end of the 1970s to review attempted "border breaches" (''Grenzdurchbrüche''). It found that 4,956&amp;nbsp;people had attempted to escape across the border between 1&amp;nbsp;January 1974 and 30&amp;nbsp;November 1979. Of those, 3,984&amp;nbsp;people (80.4%) were arrested by the [[Volkspolizei|People's Police]] in the ''[[:de:Sperrzone#DDR|Sperrzone]]'', the outer restricted zone. 205&amp;nbsp;people (4.1%) were caught at the signal fence. Within the inner security zone, the ''Schutzstreifen'', a further 743&amp;nbsp;people (15%) were arrested by the border guards. 48&amp;nbsp;people (1%) were stopped&amp;nbsp;– i.e. killed or injured&amp;nbsp;– by landmines and 43&amp;nbsp;people (0.9%) by SM-70 directional mines on the border fence. A further 67&amp;nbsp;people (1.35%) were intercepted at the border fence (shot and/or arrested). The study highlighted the effectiveness of the [[SM-70]] as a means of stopping people getting across the fence. A total of 229&amp;nbsp;people&amp;nbsp;– just 4.6% of attempted escapees, representing less than one in twenty&amp;nbsp;– made it across the border fence. Of these, the largest number (129, or 55% of successful escapees) succeeded in making it across the fence in unmined sectors. 89&amp;nbsp;people (39% of escapees) managed to cross both the minefields and the border fence, but just 12&amp;nbsp;people (6% of the total) succeeded in getting past the SM-70s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ritter|Ritter; Lapp (2007)]], p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Escape attempts were severely punished by the East German state. From 1953, the regime described the act of escaping as  ''[[Republikflucht]]'' (literally "flight from the Republic"), by analogy with the existing military term ''Fahnenflucht'' ("[[desertion]]"). A successful escapee was not a ''Flüchtling'' ("refugee") but a ''Republikflüchtiger'' ("Republic-deserter"). Those who attempted to escape were called ''Sperrbrecher'' (literally "blockade runners" but more loosely translated as "border violators").&lt;ref name="Escapees-Eichsfeld" /&gt; Those who helped escapees were not ''Fluchthelfer'' ("escape helpers"), the Western term, but ''Menschenhändler'' ("human traffickers").&lt;ref&gt;GDR Monitor, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Such ideologically coloured language enabled the regime to portray border crossers as little better than traitors and criminals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nothnagle|Nothnagle (1990)]], p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; An East German propaganda booklet published in 1955 outlined the official view of escapees:

{{quote|Both from the moral standpoint as well as in terms of the interests of the whole German nation, leaving the GDR is an act of political and moral backwardness and depravity.

Those who let themselves be recruited objectively serve West German Reaction and militarism, whether they know it or not. Is it not despicable when for the sake of a few alluring job offers or other false promises about a "guaranteed future" one leaves a country in which the seed for a new and more beautiful life is sprouting, and is already showing the first fruits, for the place that favors a new war and destruction?

Is it not an act of political depravity when citizens, whether young people, workers, or members of the intelligentsia, leave and betray what our people have created through common labor in our republic to offer themselves to the American or British secret services or work for the West German factory owners, Junkers, or militarists? Does not leaving the land of progress for the morass of an historically outdated social order demonstrate political backwardness and blindness? ...

[W]orkers throughout Germany will demand punishment for those who today leave the German Democratic Republic, the strong bastion of the fight for peace, to serve the deadly enemy of the German people, the imperialists and militarists.&lt;ref&gt;Socialist Unity Party's Agitation Department, Berlin District (2001) (orig. 1955 November), "[http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/notiz3.htm Wer die Deutsche Demokratische Republik verläßt, stellt sich auf die Seite der Kriegstreiber]" ("He Who Leaves the German Democratic Republic Joins the Warmongers", In ''Notizbuch des Agitators'' ("Agitator's Notebook"); In Series: ''[http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/ German Propaganda Archive]'' (online) Translator Randall Bytwerk, Grand Rapids, MI: Calvin College.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Republikflucht'' became a crime in 1957, punishable by heavy fines and up to three years' imprisonment. Any act associated with an escape attempt was subject to this legislation.

Refugees used a variety of methods to escape across the border. The great majority crossed on foot, though some took more unusual routes. One of the most spectacular was the [[East German balloon escape|balloon escape]] in September 1979 of eight people from two families in a home-made hot-air balloon. Their flight involved an ascent to more than {{convert|2500|m|ft}} before landing near the West German town of [[Naila]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Homemade balloon carries 8 to freedom|url=

Other escapees relied more on physical strength and endurance.

One of the few that succeeded took place on 2&amp;nbsp;October 1961, when 53&amp;nbsp;people from the border village of  [[Böseckendorf]]&amp;nbsp;– a quarter of the village's population&amp;nbsp;– escaped ''en masse'', followed by another 13&amp;nbsp;inhabitants in February 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cramer|Cramer (2008)]], pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt;  An unusual mass escape occurred in September 1964 when 14&amp;nbsp;East Germans, including eleven children, were smuggled across the border in a refrigerated truck. They were able to escape detection by being concealed under the carcasses of slaughtered and stuffed pigs being transported to the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two Families Flee From East Germany|work=The Times|date=11 September 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those working on or near the border were occasionally able to use their privileged access and knowledge to escape. For the border guards, this presented special dangers, as their colleagues were under orders to shoot without warning if an escape attempt was made. The dilemmas they faced were highlighted in the May 1969 defection of a soldier and a [[Ranks of the German Bundeswehr#Non-commissioned officers|non-commissioned officer]] (NCO) of the ''Grenztruppen''. When the NCO made his escape, the soldier, Jürgen Lange, decided not to shoot him. As this exposed Lange to severe punishment by his superiors for disobeying the order to shoot, Lange made his own escape ten minutes later. When he reached the West German side, Lange found that his rifle had been sabotaged by his NCO to prevent him firing in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cramer|Cramer (2008)]], p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet soldiers also sometimes escaped across the border, though this was very rare. Only eight such defections succeeded between 1953 and 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Soviet soldier flees|date=13 July 1984|work=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traffic was not one-way; thousands of people a year migrated from West Germany to East Germany. The East German press described such individuals as "west zone refugees" who were fleeing "political pressure", "growing unlawfulness" or "worsening economic conditions". Research carried out by the West German government found more prosaic reasons, such as marital problems, family estrangement and the homesickness of those who had lived in East Germany in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Escape Into East Germany Not Blocked by Wire, Mines|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lpwRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yOgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6886,1966308&amp;dq=border+escape+east-germany|agency=The Associated Press|date=7 July 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Allied military personnel, including British, French, German and United States troops, also defected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two Soldiers Go To E.

The fate of such defectors varied considerably. Some were sent straight to labour camps on charges of espionage. Others committed suicide, while a few were able to find wives and work on the eastern side of the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Have U.S. Army Men In Europe Defected Behind The Iron Curtain?|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PwkOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=93wDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7007,2115464&amp;dq=us+border+defect+east-germany|date=14 June 1964|work=St. Petersburg Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Order to fire==
{{main|Schießbefehl}}
From 1945 onwards, unauthorised crossers of the inner German border risked being shot by Soviet or East German border guards. The use of deadly force was termed the ''Schießbefehl'' ("order to fire" or "command to shoot"). It was formally in force as early as 1948, when regulations concerning the use of firearms on the border were promulgated. A regulation issued to East German police  27&amp;nbsp;May 1952 stipulated that "failure to obey the orders of the Border Patrol will be met by the use of arms." From the 1960s through to the end of the 1980s, the border guards were given daily verbal orders (''Vergatterung'') to "track down, arrest or annihilate border violators." The GDR formally codified its regulations on the use of deadly force in March 1982, when the State Border Law mandated that firearms were to be used as the "maximum measure in the use of force" against individuals who "publicly attempt to break through the state border".&lt;ref name="Firearms-Eichsfeld"&gt;"The Use of Firearms at the Border". Grenzmuseum Eichsfeld&lt;/ref&gt; The GDR's leadership explicitly endorsed the use of deadly force. General [[Heinz Hoffmann]], the [[Ministry of National Defence (East Germany)|GDR Minister of Defence]], declared in August 1966 that "anyone who does not respect our border will feel the bullet." In 1974, [[Erich Honecker]], as Chairman of the [[National Defense Council of East Germany]], ordered: "Firearms are to be ruthlessly used in the event of attempts to break through the border, and the comrades who have successfully used their firearms are to be commended."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hertle|Hertle (2007)]], pp. 100–101&lt;/ref&gt;

East German border guards had a standard procedure to follow if they detected unauthorised individuals in the border zone. (Though the West Germans referred to the control strip as a "death strip", deadly force could be used at any location along the border&amp;nbsp;– it did not depend on an individual's being in, or crossing, the control strip.) If the individual was less than {{convert|100|m|ft}} away, the border guard would first order: "Stop! Border sentry! Hands up!" (''"Halt! Grenzposten! Hände hoch!"'') or "Stop, stand still, or I will shoot!" (''"Halt! Stehenbleiben, oder ich schieße!"''). If the individual was further away or on the Western side of the border fence the guard was authorised to shoot without warning. If the escapee was a fellow border guard, he could be shot immediately from any distance without prior warning. Border guards were instructed not to shoot if innocent bystanders might be hit or if the escapee had made it into West German territory, or if the line of fire was into West Germany. In practice, though, shots fired from East Germany often landed in West German territory.&lt;ref name="Rottman-56"&gt;[[#Rottman|Rottman (2008)]], p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

The border guards were under considerable pressure to obey the ''Schießbefehl''. If they shot escapees they were rewarded with medals, bonuses and sometimes promotion. In one typical example, the killers of one would-be escapee in East Berlin in February 1972 were rewarded by being decorated with the "Order of Merit of the Border Troops of the GDR" and a bonus of 150&amp;nbsp;marks.&lt;ref&gt;''K.-H. W. v. Germany.'' European Court of Human Rights. Application no. 37201/97. Judgment on the Merits (22&amp;nbsp;March 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, failure to shoot or suspicion that a shooter had deliberately missed was punished.&lt;ref name="Shears, p. 84"&gt;[[#Shears|Shears (1970)]], p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Schießbefehl'' was, not surprisingly, very controversial in the West and was singled out for criticism by the West Germans. The West German authorities established a "Central Recording Office" to record details of deaths on the border, with the ultimate aim of prosecuting the offenders. This significantly discomfited the East German authorities, who repeatedly but unsuccessfully demanded the office's closure.&lt;ref name="Eisenhammer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Eisenhammer|first=John|title=Dossier on the dark days of Communism|work=The Independent|date=10 February 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GDR authorities occasionally suspended the ''Schießbefehl'' on occasions when it would have been politically inconvenient to have to explain dead refugees, such as during a visit to the GDR by the French foreign minister in 1985.&lt;ref name="Firearms-Eichsfeld" /&gt; It was also a problem for many of the East German border guards and was the motivating factor behind a number of escapes, when guards facing a crisis of confidence defected because of their unwillingness to shoot fellow citizens.&lt;ref name="Shears, p. 84"/&gt;

==Deaths on the border==

It is not known how many people died on the inner German border or who they were, as East Germany treated such information as a closely guarded secret. But numbers have risen steadily since unification, as evidence has been gathered from East German records. Current unofficial estimates put the figure at up to 1,100&amp;nbsp;people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More Than 1,100 Berlin Wall Victims|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1673538,00.html|work=Deutsche Welle|date=9 August 2005|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; though officially released figures give a lower count for the death toll before and after the Berlin Wall was built.

There were many ways to die on the inner German border. Some escapees were shot by the border guards, while others were killed by mines and booby-traps. A substantial number drowned while trying to cross the Baltic and the Elbe river. Some died of heart attacks during their escape attempts; in one incident, a baby died after its parents gave it sleeping pills to keep it quiet during the crossing.&lt;ref name="Connolly"&gt;{{cite news|last=Connolly|first=Kate|title='More than 1,000 died' trying to flee East Germany|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/1438720/More-than-1000-died-trying-to-flee-East-Germany.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=13 August 2003|accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of those killed on the border were attempting to escape. On 13&amp;nbsp;October 1961, ''Westfälische Rundschau'' journalist [[Kurt Lichtenstein]] was shot on the border near the village of [[Zicherie]] after he attempted to speak with East German farm workers. His death aroused condemnation across the political spectrum in West Germany; he was a former parliamentary representative of the German Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cramer|Cramer (2008)]], p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The incident prompted students from [[Braunschweig]] to erect a sign on the border protesting the killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bild.bundesarchiv.de/archives/barchpic/search/_1254270771/|title=Bild175-P05-00002-0001|publisher=Bundesarchiv|accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An apparent mix-up over papers at a border crossing point led to the shooting of [[Benito Corghi]], an Italian truck driver, in August 1976. Corghi was a member of the [[Italian Communist Party]], which denounced the killing. The episode severely embarrassed the East German government and produced an unusual apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=East Germany Apologizes For Fatal Shooting of Italian|work=The New York Times|date=7 August 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one notorious shooting on 1&amp;nbsp;May 1976, a former East German political prisoner, [[SM-70#Michael Gartenschläger|Michael Gartenschläger]], who had fled to the West some years before, was ambushed and killed by a Stasi commando squad on the border near [[Büchen]] as he tried to dismantle an SM-70 anti-personnel mine. When his body was buried it was described merely as an "unknown body fished out of the water". The Stasi's after-action report, however, declared that "before he could carry out the act [of removing the mine], Gartenschläger was liquidated by security forces of the GDR".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mielke|first=Michael|title=Der Fall Gartenschläger|work=Berliner Morgenpost|url=http://www.morgenpost.de/printarchiv/blickpunkt/article529008/Der_Fall_Gartenschlaeger.html|date=6 May 2002|accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-five East German border guards died after being shot from the Western side of the border or by resisting escapees or (often accidentally) by their own colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baker|Baker (2004)]], p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The East German government described them as "victims of armed assaults and imperialist provocations against the state border of the GDR"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sie gaben ihr Leben für ihr Vaterland|work=Neues Deutschland|page=9|date=13–14 August 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and alleged that "bandits" in the West took potshots at border guards doing their duty&amp;nbsp;– a version of events that was uncorroborated by Western accounts of border incidents.

The two sides commemorated their dead in significantly different ways. Various mostly unofficial memorials were set up on the western side by people seeking to commemorate victims of the border. West Germans such as Michael Gartenschläger and Kurt Lichtenstein were commemorated with signs and memorials, some of which were supported by the government. After the policy of ''détente'' was initiated in the 1970s this became politically inconvenient and state support for border memorials largely ceased. The taboo in East Germany surrounding escapees meant that the great majority of deaths went unpublicised and uncommemorated. The border guards who died on the frontier were, however, portrayed as "martyrs" by the East German regime. Four stone memorials were erected in East Berlin to mark their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ladd1998|Ladd (1998)]], p.25&lt;/ref&gt; The regime named schools, barracks and other public facilities after the dead guards and used their memorials as places of pilgrimage to signify that (as a slogan put it) "their deaths are our commitment" to maintaining the border. After 1989 the memorials were vandalised, neglected and ultimately removed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ladd2004|Ladd (2004)]], p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Few East German escapees were commemorated in the West, not least because their identities were mostly unknown until after 1989. One notable exception was Helmut Kleinert, a 23-year-old from [[Quedlinburg]] in [[Saxony-Anhalt]] who was machine-gunned to death on 1&amp;nbsp;August 1963 as he and his 22-year-old pregnant wife attempted to cross the border near [[Hohegeiß]] in the [[Harz]] mountains.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bundeszentrale|Kaminsky (2007)]], p.295&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial dedicated to "The Unknown" was soon erected by local people on the western side of the border. When Kleinert's identity became known in the West, his name was added to the memorial. It became something of a shrine with piles of flowers and wreaths deposited by visitors. The East German regime strongly objected and erected a watchtower nearby, from which threats and communist propaganda were broadcast across the border. Ultimately, in August 1971, the memorial was replaced by a stone set {{convert|150|m|ft}} away and out of sight of the border.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cramer|Cramer (2008)]], pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eva Gonzalès''' (April 19, 1849—May 6, 1883) was a [[France|French]] [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painter.

==Early life==
Eva Gonzalès was born in Paris  and became introduced to  sophisticated literary and art circles at an early age by her father, whom was a writer [[Emmanuel Gonzalès]].&lt;ref name="Heller 1987 94"&gt;{{cite book |last=Heller |first=Nancy G.|date=1987|title=Women Artists|location=New York|publisher=Abbeville Press|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Women Impressionists: A Sourcebook|last=Clement|first=Russell T.|last2=Houze|first2=Annick|last3=Erbolato-Ramsey|first3=Christiane|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2000|location=Westport, CT|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, at age sixteen , Eva Gonzales began her professional training and art lessons in drawing from the society portraitist [[Charles Joshua Chaplin|Charles Chaplin]].&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Gaze|editor-first=Delia|title=Dictionary of Women Artists|date=1997|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|location=Chicago|pages=596–599|title-link=Dictionary of Women Artists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through her father’s connections as a founding president of the [[Société des gens de lettres]], she met a variety of members of the Parisian cultural elite, and from a young age was exposed to the new ideas surrounding art and literature at the time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women &amp; Art: A History of Women Painters and Sculptors from the Renaissance to the 20th Century|last=Fine|first=Elsa Honig|date=1978|publisher=Allanheld &amp; Schram|location=Montclair, NJ|oclc = 3415319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student of Edouard Manet==
Gonzalès is best known for her starting out as a pupil of the artist [[Édouard Manet]] in February 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/edouard-manet-eva-gonzales|title=Edouard Manet, ''Eva Gonzalès''|website=National Gallery, London|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This relationship was formed by poor reviews that Manet received about his Salon entries, which made him hestiant to openly discuss his work. However, Eva's striking beauty was the source that brought Manet out of his shell. Manet is said to have begun a portrait of her at once, which was completed in March 1870 and exhibited as ''Mlle E.G.'' at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in that year. Unfortunately her debut submissions to the Salon, also in 1870, were overshadowed by the presence of Manet's portrait. In the ''Portrait of Eva Gonzales'' , Manet depicts her working at an easel, yet her stiff posture and expensive dress are clearly unfit for creating artwork.This depiction of her likely caused some critics to perceive her simply as a young, beautiful, decorative model who was working with an older established male painter. Gonzalès was Manet's only formal student and also modeled for several members of the Impressionist school.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Manet's ''Mlle E.G.'' was discussed more than Gonzalès' oeuvre at her own 1885 retrospective and at the Galerie Daber's exhibition for her work in 1950.&lt;ref name=Emmer&gt;{{cite web|last=Emmer|first=Janalee|title=Rethinking Self: Eva Gonzalès (1849-1883) On Her Own|url=http://www.huichawaii.org/assets/emmer,-janalee---rethinking-self--eva-gonzales-%281849-1883%29-on-her-own.pdf|publisher=Ohio Wesleyan University|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gonzales' style aligns very closely to that of Manet's Spanish period, slight changes were made through the years as her forms of art consisted of discipline with a sober palette. The subjects she chose to use, were a representation of everyday life, that was deeply transpired by being under Chaplin's guidance. 

During 1871, Manet pursued to incorporate more brilliant colors and  active surfacesof the Impressionists within his work. Meanwhile, Gonzales decided to retain the neutral color schemes and precise contours of the sixties, while leaving her pastels in softer tones, that created a lighter palette for her to work with. Gonzales' work may not be regarded as innovative, but it still holds charm and a sense of sincere personal expression that gives it significant value. Despite her association of being one of Manet's student, her work still carries meaning and progressed in the direction that perfectly aligned with her temperament. 

==Work/Later Life==
Gonzalès' work was celebrated by Salon reviewers for the inherent intuition with which she approached art, as well as her intrinsic technical skill.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At one point she listed herself as a student of Charles Chaplin with her submissions to the Salon, perhaps as a method to be taken more seriously. Much of her work became characterized through Salon reviews with discussion of her "feminine technique" and her "seductive harmony." However, her large-scale painting, ''Box at the Théâtre des Italiens'' (1874), was characterized by the Salon jury as having "masculine vigour," which led them to reject it with questions as to her painting's authenticity.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt; Nevertheless, her work was reviewed positively by a variety of critics. [[Louis Leroy]], [[Jules Castagnary]], and [[Émile Zola]] praised the work she successfully showed at the Salons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, the art critic [[Maria Deraismes]] championed Gonzalés for producing paintings which challenged the way female painters were viewed and separated from the art scene in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boime|first=Albert|date=1994|title=Maria Deraismes and Eva Gonzalès: A Feminist Critique of 'Une Loge aux Théâtre des Italiens'|jstor=1358602|journal=Woman's Art Journal|volume=15|issue=2|pages=31–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


Like Édouard Manet, Gonzalès never exhibited in the Impressionist exhibitions in [[Paris]], but she is considered part of the group because of her painting style. While studying under Manet, Gonzalès' self-portraits suggest that she was exploring her individuality and identity as an artist by presenting subtle correctives to Manet's version of her. Until 1872, she was strongly influenced by Manet but later developed her own, more personal style. This can be seen in works such as ''Enfant de Troupe'' (1870), which is a nod to Manet's ''Le Fifre'' (1866), while many of her later paintings involved portraits of her sister, Jeanne.&lt;ref name="Riding"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/28/arts/3-artists-who-left-a-fainter-impression.html|title=3 Artists Who Left A Fainter Impression|last=Riding|first=Alan|date=28 October 1993|work=The New York Times|access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was common of Gonzales to use her family members, particularly her husband and her sister, Jeanne Gonzalès, as models in her work.&lt;ref name="Riding" /&gt;


In 1879,  after a three year engagement,she married Henri Guérard, a graphic artist and Manet's engraver.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The couple had a son named Jean Raimond in April 1883, shortly before receiving news of the death of Manet.  During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] she sought refuge in [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]].&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

Her work was exhibited at the offices of the art review ''L'Art'' in 1882&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; and at the [[Georges Petit|Galerie Georges Petit]] in 1883.

==Death==
In 1883, Gonzelès died in childbirth at the age of thirty-four,&lt;ref name="Heller 1987 94"/&gt; five days after the death of her teacher, Edouard Manet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=50 Women Artists You Should Know|editor1-first=Christiane|editor1-last=Weidemann|publisher=Prestel|editor2-first=Petra|editor2-last=Larass|editor3-first=Melanie|editor3-last=Klier|date=2008|location=Munich|oclc = 195744889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Which left her son to be raised by his father and her sister, Jeanne, who later became Guerard's second wife. Since her death, exhibitions of Gonzales work , were held at the Salons de La Vie Moderne (1885), the Salon d'Automne (1907), at several galleries  in Paris.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;Her work has also been exhibited at the Musee National des Beaux- Arts in Monte Carlo (1952).

&lt;br /&gt;

== Accomplishments ==
Eva Gonzales' paintings have been purchased by the French government along with private collectors. Out of all her works, the broadest representation of her oeuvre can be spotted in the collection of her son and his heirs.

Some other accomplishments that she has had throughout her career , include the newspaper ''L'Art'' purchasing her pastels and receiving recognition in England, Belgium, and France.

== Background ==
Brian Hare, director of [[Duke University]] Canine Cognition Center, says the human-canine bond goes back thousands of years. Dogs have been drawn to people since humans began to exist in settlements. Dogs are the only species that does not show fear of strangers. Hare says that dogs are "actually xenophilic-they love strangers!"(qtd. in Figell).&lt;ref&gt;Figel, Amanda.. "The Healing Power of Dogs." National Geographic. National Geographic Society, National Geographic News, 21 Dec. 2012. Web. 03 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a dog does not think according to language, people often intuit that dogs are compassionate and communicative. This builds a feeling of intimacy, leading the person to feel safe and understood. This can benefit the grieving human, who may be apprehensive about talking with another person for the fear of being hurt or lied to. Pets are an addition to therapy because they allow people to feel safe and accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Alan, and Aaron Honori Katcher. Between Pets and People: The Importance of Animal Companionship: New York: Putnam, c1983, 1983. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therapists believe they can utilize clients' attachment to animals for therapeutic reasons (Urichuk).

==The deep-space radiation environment==
[[File:PIA16938-RadiationSources-InterplanetarySpace.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Sources of ionizing radiation in interplanetary space.]]
The radiation environment of deep space is different from that on the Earth's surface or in [[low Earth orbit]], due to the much larger flux of high-energy galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), along with radiation from [[solar proton event]]s (SPEs) and the [[radiation belt]]s. 

Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) consist of high energy [[proton]]s (85%), helium (14%) and other high energy [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] ([[HZE ions]]).&lt;ref name="THREE - Space Radiation Introduction" /&gt;  Solar energetic particles consist primarily of protons accelerated by the Sun to high energies via proximity to [[solar flares]] and [[coronal mass ejections]]. 
Heavy ions and low energy protons and helium particles are highly ionizing forms of radiation, which produce distinct biological damage compared to X-rays and gamma-rays. Microscopic energy deposition from highly ionizing particles consists of a core radiation track due to direct ionizations by the particle and low energy electrons produced in ionization, and a penumbra of higher energy electrons that may extend hundreds of microns from the particles path in tissue. The core track produces extremely large clusters of ionizations within a few [[nanometre]]s, which is qualitatively distinct from energy deposition by [[X-rays]] and [[gamma ray]]s; hence human epidemiology data which only exists for these latter forms of radiation is limited in predicting the health risks from space radiation to astronauts.

But of course the radiation belts are within Earth’s magnetosphere and do not occur in deep space, while organ dose equivalents on the International Space Station are dominated by GCR not trapped radiation. Microscopic energy deposition in cells and tissues is distinct for GCR compared to X-rays on Earth leading to both qualitative and quantitative differences in biological effects, while there is no human epidemiology data for GCR for cancer and other fatal risks.

The solar cycle is an approximately 11-year period of varying solar activity including solar maximum where the solar wind is strongest and solar minimum where the solar wind is weakest. Galactic cosmic rays create a continuous radiation dose throughout the [[Solar System]] that increases during solar minimum and decreases during solar maximum ([[Solar variation|solar activity]]). The inner and outer radiation belts are two regions of trapped particles from the solar wind that are later accelerated by dynamic interaction with the Earth's magnetic field. While always high, the radiation dose in these belts can increase dramatically during [[geomagnetic storms]] and [[substorm]]s. Solar proton events (SPEs) are bursts of energetic protons accelerated by the Sun. They occur relatively rarely and can produce extremely high radiation levels. Without thick shielding, SPEs are sufficiently strong to cause acute [[radiation poisoning]] and death.&lt;ref name="nasa2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/books/apollo/S2ch3.htm|publisher=lsda.jsc.nasa.gov|title=Biomedical Results From Apollo - Radiation Protection and Instrumentation|accessdate=2 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515020144/http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/books/apollo/S2ch3.htm|archivedate=15 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life on the Earth's surface is protected from galactic cosmic rays by a number of factors:
# The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to primary cosmic rays with energies below about 1 gigaelectron volt (GeV), so only secondary radiation can reach the surface. The secondary radiation is also attenuated by absorption in the atmosphere, as well as by radioactive decay in flight of some particles, such as muons. Particles entering from a direction far from the zenith are especially attenuated. The world's population receives an average of 0.4 milli[[sievert]]s (mSv) of cosmic radiation annually (separate from other sources of radiation exposure like inhaled radon) due to atmospheric shielding. At 12&amp;nbsp;km altitude, above most of the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere's]] protection, radiation as an annual rate rises to 20&amp;nbsp;mSv at the equator to 50–120&amp;nbsp;mSv at the poles, varying between solar maximum and minimum conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cordis.europa.eu/documents/documentlibrary/75331981EN6.pdf Evaluation of the Cosmic Ray Exposure of Aircraft Crew]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/2008/09-86753_Report_2008_GA_Report_corr2.pdf Sources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation, UNSCEAR 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Phillips| first =Tony| title =The Effects of Space Weather on Aviation| work =Science News| publisher =NASA| date =25 October 2013| url =https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/25oct_aviationswx/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Missions beyond low Earth orbit transit the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s. Thus they may need to be shielded against exposure to cosmic rays, Van Allen radiation, or solar flares.

As a result, the energy input of GCRs to the atmosphere is negligible – about 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; of [[solar radiation]] – roughly the same as starlight.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;Jasper Kirkby; [https://arxiv.org/abs/0804.1938v1 Cosmic Rays And Climate] CERN-PH-EP/2008-005 26 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the above factors, all but the first one apply to [[low Earth orbit]] craft, such as the [[Space Shuttle]] and the [[International Space Station]]. Exposures on the [[International Space Station|ISS]] average 150&amp;nbsp;mSv per year, although frequent crew rotations minimize individual risk.&lt;ref name = historicalexposure&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20070010704_2007005310.pdf Space Radiation Organ Doses for Astronauts on Past and Future Missions] Table 4&lt;/ref&gt; Astronauts on [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] and [[Skylab]] missions received on average 1.2&amp;nbsp;mSv/day and 1.4&amp;nbsp;mSv/day respectively.&lt;ref name = historicalexposure/&gt;  Since the durations of the Apollo and Skylab missions were days and months, respectively, rather than years, the doses involved were smaller than would be expected on future long-term missions such as to a near-Earth asteroid or to Mars&lt;ref name="WIRED-20140212" /&gt; (unless far more shielding could be provided).

On 31 May 2013, NASA scientists reported that a possible [[manned mission to Mars]]&lt;ref name="WIRED-20140212" /&gt; may involve a great [[radiation|radiation risk]] based on the amount of [[radiation|energetic particle radiation]] detected by the [[radiation assessment detector]] (RAD) on the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] while traveling from the [[Earth]] to [[Mars]] in 2011–2012.&lt;ref name="SCI-20130531a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI-20130531b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20130530" /&gt;  However, the absorbed dose and dose equivalent for a Mars mission were predicted in the early 1990s by Badhwar, Cucinotta, and others (see for example Badhwar, Cucinotta et al., Radiation Research vol. 138, 201-208, 1994) and the result of the MSL experiment are to a large extent consistent with these earlier predictions.

The potential acute and chronic health effects of space radiation, as with other ionizing radiation exposures, involve both direct damage to DNA, indirect effects due to generation of reactive oxygen species, and changes to the biochemistry of cells and tissues, which can alter gene transcription and the tissue microenvironment along with producing DNA mutations. Acute (or early radiation) effects result from high radiation doses, and these are most likely to occur after solar particle events (SPEs).&lt;ref name="THREE - Acute Effects"&gt;{{cite web|last=Seed|first=Thomas|title=Acute Effects|url=http://three.usra.edu/articles/SeedAcuteEffects.pdf|work=The Health Effects of Extraterrestrial Environments|publisher=Universities Space Research Association, Division of Space Life Sciences|accessdate=5 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426022353/http://three.usra.edu/articles/SeedAcuteEffects.pdf|archivedate=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likely chronic effects of space radiation exposure include both stochastic events such as radiation [[carcinogenesis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cucinotta|first=F.A.|author2=Durante, M.|title=Cancer risk from exposure to galactic cosmic rays: implications for space exploration by human beings|journal=Lancet Oncol.|date=2006|volume=7|pages=431–435|doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(06)70695-7|pmid=16648048|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deterministic degenerative tissue effects.

The [[Mars Radiation Environment Experiment]] (MARIE) was launched in 2001 in order to collect more data.
Estimates are that humans unshielded in interplanetary space would receive annually roughly 400 to 900&amp;nbsp;mSv (compared to 2.4&amp;nbsp;mSv on Earth) and that a Mars mission (12 months in flight and 18 months on Mars) might expose shielded astronauts to roughly 500 to 1000&amp;nbsp;mSv.&lt;ref name="icrc2005.tifr.res.in"/&gt; These doses approach the 1 to 4&amp;nbsp;Sv career limits advised by the [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] (NCRP) for [[low Earth orbit]] activities in 1989, and the more recent NCRP recommendations of 0.5 to 2 Sv in 2000 based on updated information on dose to risk conversion factors. Dose limits depend on age at exposure and sex due to difference in [[Susceptible individual|susceptibility]] with age, the added risks of [[breast cancer|breast]] and [[ovarian cancer]]s to women, and the variability of cancer risks such as [[lung cancer]] between men and women.

The quantitative biological effects of cosmic rays are poorly known, and are the subject of ongoing research. Several experiments, both in space and on Earth, are being carried out to evaluate the exact degree of danger. Additionally, the impact of the space microgravity environment on DNA repair has in part confounded the interpretation of some results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moreno-Villanueva|first=M.|author2=Wong, M. |author3=Lu, T. |author4=Zhang, Y. |author5=Wu, H. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Interplay of space radiation and microgravity in DNA damage and DNA damage response| journal=Npj Microgravity |date=2017|volume=3|issue=14|doi=10.1038/s41526-017-0019-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experiments over the last 10 years have shown results both higher and lower than predicted by current quality factors used in radiation protection, indicating large uncertainties exist. Experiments in 2007 at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]'s [[NASA Space Radiation Laboratory]] (NSRL) suggest that  biological damage due to a given exposure is actually about half what was previously estimated: specifically, it turns out that low energy protons cause more damage than high energy ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Radiat Environ Biophys |date=Jun 2007 | volume=46 |issue=2 | pages=119–23 | pmid=17256176 | title=Split-dose exposures versus dual ion exposure in human cell neoplastic transformation |vauthors=Bennett PV, Cutter NC, Sutherland BM | doi=10.1007/s00411-006-0091-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is explained by the fact that slower particles have more time to interact with molecules in the body. This may be interpreted as an acceptable result for space travel as the cells affected end up with greater energy deposition and are more likely to die without proliferating into tumors. This is in contrast to the current dogma on radiation exposure to human cells which considers lower energy radiation of higher weighting factor for tumor formation. Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) depends on radiation type described by particle charge number, Z, and kinetic energy per amu, E, and varies with tumor type with limited experimental data suggesting [[leukemia]]'s having the lowest RBE, liver tumors the highest RBE, and limited or no experimental data on RBE available for cancers that dominate human cancer risks including lung, stomach, breast, and [[bladder cancer]]s. Studies of Harderian gland tumors in a single strain of female mice with several heavy ions have been made, however it is not clear how well the RBE for this tumor type represents the RBE for human cancers such as lung, stomach, breast and bladder cancers nor how RBE changes with sex and genetic background.

Part of the [[ISS year long mission]] is to determine the health impacts of cosmic ray exposure over the course of one year spent aboard the [[International Space Station]].

However, [[sample size]]s for accurately estimating health risks directly from crew observations for the risks of concern (cancer, cataracts, cognitive and memory changes, late CNS risks, circulatory diseases, etc.) are large (typically &gt;&gt;10 persons) and necessarily involve long post-mission observation times (&gt;10 years). It will be difficult for a sufficient number of astronauts to occupy the ISS and for the missions to continue long enough to make an impact on risk predictions for late effects due to statistical limitations. Hence the need for ground-based research to predict cosmic ray health risks. In addition, radiation safety requirements mandate that risks should be adequately understood prior to astronauts incurring significant risks, and methods developed to mitigate the risks if necessary.

In September 2017, NASA reported [[Radiation|radiation levels]] on the surface of the planet [[Mars]] were temporarily [[Orders of magnitude (radiation)|doubled]], and were associated with an [[aurora]] 25-times brighter than any observed earlier, due to a massive, and unexpected, [[Coronal mass ejection|solar storm]] in the middle of the month.&lt;ref name="PHYS-20170930"&gt;{{cite web |last=Scott |first=Jim |title=Large solar storm sparks global aurora and doubles radiation levels on the martian surface |url=https://phys.org/news/2017-09-large-solar-storm-global-aurora.html |date=30 September 2017 |work=[[Phys.org]] |accessdate=30 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Central nervous system ===
{{see also|Central nervous system effects from radiation exposure during spaceflight}}
Hypothetical early and late effects on the central nervous system are of great concern to NASA and an area of active current research interest. It is postulated short- and long-term effects of CNS exposure to galactic cosmic radiation are likely to pose significant neurological health risks to human long-term space travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vazquez|first=M.E.|title=Neurobiological problems in long-term deep space flights|journal=Adv.

In addition, there were only 24 such astronauts, making [[statistical analysis]] of any potential health effects problematic.

In the above discussion dose equivalents is units of Sievert (Sv) are noted, however the Sv is a unit for comparing cancer risks for different types of ionizing radiation. For CNS effects absorbed doses in Gy are more useful, while the RBE for CNS effects is poorly understood. Furthermore, stating "hypothetical" risk is problematic, while space radiation CNS risk estimates have largely focused on early and late detriments to memory and cognition (e.g. Cucinotta, Alp, Sulzman, and Wang, Life Sciences in Space Research, 2014).

On 31 December 2012, a [[NASA]]-supported study reported that manned spaceflight may harm the brains of astronauts and accelerate the onset of [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name="PLOS-20121231"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cherry |first=Jonathan D. |last2=Frost |first2=Jeffrey L. |last3=Lemere |first3=Cynthia A. |last4=Williams |first4=Jacqueline P. |last5=Olschowka |first5=John A. |last6=O'Banion |first6=M.

A review of CNS space radiobiology by Cucinotta, Alp, Sulzman, and Wang (Life Sciences in Space Research, 2014) summarizes research studies in small animals of changes to cognition and memory, neuro-inflammation, neuron morphology, and impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Studies using simulated space radiation in small animals suggest temporary or long-term cognitive detriments could occur during a long-term space mission. Changes to neuron morphology in mouse hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex occur for heavy ions at low doses (&lt;0.3 Gy). Studies in mice and rats of chronic neuro-inflammation and behavioral changes  show variable results at low doses (~0.1 Gy or lower). Further research is needed to understand if such cognitive detriments induced by space radiation would occur in astronauts and whether they would negatively impact a Mars mission.

The cumulative heavy ion doses in space are low such that critical cells and cell components will receive only 0 or 1 particle traversal. The cumulative heavy ion dose for a Mars mission near solar minimum would be ~0.05 Gy and lower for missions at other times in the solar cycle. This suggests dose-rate effects will not occur for heavy ions as long as the total doses used in experimental studies in reasonably small (&lt;~0.1 Gy). At larger doses (&gt;~0.1 Gy) critical cells and cell components could receive more than one particle traversal, which is not reflective of the deep space environment for extended duration missions such as a mission to Mars. An alternative assumption would be if a tissues micro-environment is modified by a long-range signaling effect or change to biochemistry, whereby a particle traversal to some cells modifies the response of other cells not traversed by particles. There is limited experimental evidence, especially for central nervous system effects, available to evaluate this alternative assumption.

==Prevention==

===Shielding===
[[File:Cosmic ray shielding with secondary radiation.jpg|thumb|Standard spacecraft shielding, integrated into hull design, is strong protection from most solar radiation, but defeats this purpose with high-energy cosmic rays, as it simply splits this into showers of secondary particles. This shower of secondary and fragmented particles may be reduced by the use of hydrogen or light elements for shielding.]]
Material shielding can be effective against galactic cosmic rays, but thin shielding may actually make the problem worse for some of the higher energy rays, because more shielding causes an increased amount of [[Bremsstrahlung|secondary radiation]], although thick shielding could counter such too.&lt;ref name = mass_shielding&gt;NASA SP-413 [http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/75SummerStudy/5appendE.html Space Settlements: A Design Study. Appendix E Mass Shielding] Retrieved 3 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The aluminium walls of the ISS, for example, are believed to produce a net reduction in radiation exposure. In interplanetary space, however, it is believed that thin aluminium shielding would give a net increase in radiation exposure but would gradually decrease as more shielding is added to capture generated secondary radiation.&lt;ref name="islandone.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.islandone.org/Settlements/MagShield.html | title=Magnetic Radiation Shielding: An Idea Whose Time Has Returned? | author=G.Landis |date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Popular Science | title=Juno Probe, Built to Study Jupiter's Radiation Belt, Gets A Titanium Suit of Interplanetary Armor | author=Rebecca Boyle | date=13 July 2010 | url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2010-07/juno-probe-built-study-jupiters-radiation-belt-gets-coat-armor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of space radiation shielding should include tissue or water equivalent shielding along with the shielding material under study. This observation is readily understood by noting that the average tissue self-shielding of sensitive organs is about 10&amp;nbsp;cm, and that secondary radiation produced in tissue such as low energy protons, helium and heavy ions are of high [[Linear_energy_transfer|linear energy transfer]] (LET) and make significant contributions (&gt;25%) to the overall biological damage from GCR. Studies of aluminum, polyethylene, liquid hydrogen, or other shielding materials, will involve secondary radiation not reflective of secondary radiation produced in tissue, hence the need to include tissue equivalent shielding in studies of space radiation shielding effectiveness.

Several strategies are being studied for ameliorating the effects of this radiation hazard for planned human interplanetary spaceflight:
* Spacecraft can be constructed out of hydrogen-rich plastics, rather than aluminium.&lt;ref name="nasa3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/25aug_plasticspaceships.htm|publisher=science.nasa.gov|title=NASA - Plastic Spaceships|accessdate=2 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323201842/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/25aug_plasticspaceships.htm|archivedate=23 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Material shielding has been considered:
** Liquid hydrogen, which would be brought along as fuel in any case, tends to give relatively good shielding, while producing relatively low levels of secondary radiation. Therefore, the fuel could be placed so as to act as a form of shielding around the crew. However, as fuel is consumed by the craft, the crew's shielding decreases.
** Water, which is necessary to sustain life, could also contribute to shielding. But it too is consumed during the journey unless waste products are utilized.&lt;ref name = newscientist&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7753|publisher=New Scientist|title= Cosmic rays may prevent long-haul space travel|date= 1 August 2005 |accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Asteroids could serve to provide shielding.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, P. (2011) [http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/discoblog/2011/02/11/to-hitch-a-ride-to-mars-just-flag-down-an-asteroid/ "To Hitch a Ride to Mars, Just Flag Down an Asteroid"] ''Discover'' magazine blog&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Matloff G.L. |author2=Wilga M. | date = 2011 | title = NEOs as stepping stones to Mars and main-belt asteroids | doi = 10.1016/j.actaastro.2010.02.026 | journal = Acta Astronautica | volume = 68 | issue = 5–6| pages = 599–602 |bibcode=2011AcAau..68..599M }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Magnetic deflection of charged radiation particles and/or electrostatic repulsion is a hypothetical alternative to pure conventional mass shielding under investigation. In theory, power requirements for a 5-meter torus drop from an excessive 10 [[Gigawatt|GW]] for a simple pure electrostatic shield (too discharged by space electrons) to a moderate 10&amp;nbsp;[[kilowatt]]s (kW) by using a hybrid design.&lt;ref name="islandone.org"/&gt;  However, such complex active shielding is untried, with workability and practicalities more uncertain than material shielding.&lt;ref name="islandone.org"/&gt;

Special provisions would also be necessary to protect against a solar proton event, which could increase fluxes to levels that would kill a crew in hours or days rather than months or years. Potential mitigation strategies include providing a small habitable space behind a spacecraft's water supply or with particularly thick walls or providing an option to abort to the protective environment provided by the Earth's magnetosphere. The Apollo mission used a combination of both strategies. Upon receiving confirmation of an SPE, astronauts would move to the Command Module, which had thicker aluminium walls than the Lunar Module, then return to Earth. It was later determined from measurements taken by instruments flown on Apollo that the Command Module would have provided sufficient shielding to prevent significant crew harm.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

None of these strategies currently provide a method of protection that would be known to be sufficient&lt;ref name="parker" /&gt; while conforming to likely limitations on the mass of the payload at present (around $10,000/kg) launch prices. Scientists such as University of Chicago professor emeritus Eugene Parker are not optimistic it can be solved anytime soon.&lt;ref name="parker"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Eugene N. Parker | title=Shielding Space Travelers | journal=Scientific American | volume=294 | issue=3 | pages=40–7 | date=March 2006| bibcode=2006SciAm.294c..40P | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0306-40 | pmid=16502610 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For passive mass shielding, the required amount could be too heavy to be affordably lifted into space without changes in economics (like hypothetical [[non-rocket spacelaunch]] or usage of extraterrestrial resources) — many hundreds of metric tons for a reasonably-sized crew compartment. For instance, a NASA design study for an ambitious large spacestation envisioned 4 metric tons per square meter of shielding to drop radiation exposure to 2.5&amp;nbsp;mSv annually (± a factor of 2 uncertainty), less than the tens of millisieverts or more in some populated [[Background Radiation#Natural background radiation|high natural background radiation areas]] on Earth, but the sheer mass for that level of mitigation was considered practical only because it involved first building a lunar [[mass driver]] to launch material.&lt;ref name = mass_shielding/&gt;

Several active shielding methods have been considered that might be less massive than passive shielding, but they remain speculative.&lt;ref name="islandone.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~simon_g_shepherd/research/Shielding/docs/ToMaSS.pdf Simulations of Magnetic Shields for Spacecraft]. Retrieved 3 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the type of radiation penetrating farthest through thick material shielding, deep in interplanetary space, is GeV positively charged nuclei, a repulsive electrostatic field has been proposed, but this has problems including plasma instabilities and the power needed for an accelerator constantly keeping the charge from being neutralized by deep-space electrons.&lt;ref&gt;NASA SP-413 [http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/75SummerStudy/4appendD.html Space Settlements: A Design Study. Appendix D The Plasma Core Shield] Retrieved 3 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  A more common proposal is magnetic shielding generated by superconductors (or plasma currents). Among the difficulties with this proposal is that, for a compact system, magnetic fields up to 10–20 teslas could be required around a manned spacecraft, higher than the several teslas in [[MRI]] machines. Such high fields can produce headaches and migraines in MRI patients, and long-duration exposure to such fields has not been studied. Opposing-electromagnet designs might cancel the field in the crew sections of the spacecraft, but would require more mass. It is also possible to use a combination of a magnetic field with an electrostatic field, with the spacecraft having zero total charge. The hybrid design would theoretically ameliorate the problems, but would be complex and possibly infeasible.&lt;ref name="islandone.org"/&gt;

Part of the uncertainty is that the effect of human exposure to galactic cosmic rays is poorly known in quantitative terms. The [[NASA Space Radiation Laboratory]] is currently studying the effects of radiation in living organisms as well as protective shielding.

===Drugs===
Another line of research is the development of drugs that enhance the body's natural capacity to repair damage caused by radiation. Some of the drugs that are being considered are [[retinoids]], which are [[vitamins]] with [[antioxidant]] properties, and molecules that retard cell division, giving the body time to fix damage before harmful mutations can be duplicated.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Timing of missions===

Due to the potential negative effects of astronaut exposure to cosmic rays, solar activity may play a role in future space travel. Because galactic cosmic ray fluxes within the Solar System are lower during periods of strong solar activity, interplanetary travel during solar maximum should minimize the average dose to astronauts.

Although the [[Forbush decrease]] effect during coronal mass ejections can temporarily lower the flux of galactic cosmic rays, the short duration of the effect (1–3 days) and the approximately 1% chance that a CME generates a dangerous solar proton event limits the utility of timing missions to coincide with CMEs.

===Orbital selection===

Radiation dosage from the Earth's radiation belts is typically mitigated by selecting orbits that avoid the belts or pass through them relatively quickly. For example, a [[low Earth orbit]], with low inclination, will generally be below the inner belt.

The orbits of the Earth-Moon system [[Lagrange Points|Lagrange points]] {{L2}} - {{L5}} take them out of the protection of the Earth's [[magnetosphere]] for approximately two-thirds of the time.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The orbits of Earth-Sun system Lagrange Points {{L1}} and {{L3}} - {{L5}} are always outside the protection of the Earth's magnetosphere.

"'''I'll Walk You Home'''" is the thirty-fifth episode of the [[Holby City (series 18)|eighteenth series]] of the British [[medical drama]] television series ''[[Holby City]]''. The episode was written by Andy Bayliss and directed by Paulette Randall, and premiered on [[BBC One]] on 7 June 2016. The episode features the death of established character [[Arthur Digby]] ([[Rob Ostlere]]), a [[Modernising Medical Careers|CT2]] doctor who had worked on the show's fictitious Keller and AAU wards. Writers worked alongside a consultant oncologist for medical advice to provide an accurate depiction of terminal cancer. The episode also features the return of two former regular characters and includes an appearance of a character from ''Holby City's'' sister-show ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]''.

The episode was structured with positive and upbeat tones transitioning into the dark scenes focusing on death. "I'll Walk You Home" received positive reviews from critics for its "gritty" theme. All reviews noted that it was an emotional episode. Sarah Deen from the ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' branded it one of the "saddest episodes ever".

==Plot==
Arthur and his wife [[Modernising Medical Careers|F1]] [[Morven Shreve|Morven Digby]] (Eleanor Fanyinka) announce their decision to go travelling. They want to spend the time Arthur has left visiting historic sites. His best friend [[Specialty registrar|CT1]] doctor [[Dominic Copeland]] ([[David Ames (actor)|David Ames]]) is upset and thinks that Arthur is being selfish. Consultant general surgeon [[Ric Griffin]] ([[Hugh Quarshie]]) tries to make Dom realise that it is Arthur's choice. He decides to distract himself by attending to patient Alison Jones (Elizabeth Cadwallader). Dom realises that he has been unfair to Arthur and they have a discussion. Dom hands Arthur war medals that were stolen from their flat months earlier. Arthur realises that he wants to stay in Holby City and live out his final days with friends.

Consultant cardiothoracic surgeon [[Jac Naylor]] ([[Rosie Marcel]]) sets [[Specialty registrar|CT1]] doctor [[Zosia March]] ([[Camilla Arfwedson]]) a series of surgical tasks to prove her worth. Zosia rises to the challenge but becomes tired of Jac's demands. Jac tells Zosia she is selfish and uncaring towards Arthur. She accuses her of giving Arthur a stent operation to advance her own career. Zosia confronts Jac and accuses her of being "cold", this does not phase Jac who ignores her. Zosia ex-boyfriend, [[Specialist registrar]] [[Oliver Valentine]] ([[James Anderson (English actor)|James Anderson]]) and [[Staff nurse]] [[Cara Martinez]] ([[Niamh Walsh]]) apologise to her for sharing a kiss. Cara gives Oliver a picture of his dead wife [[Tara Lo]] ([[Jing Lusi]]) and Zosia spots him with it. [[Staff nurse]] [[Essie Harrison]] ([[Kaye Wragg]]) rallies staff to get ready to perform a song and dance surprise for Arthur. They perform a dance routine and are joined by [[Ethan Hardy]] ([[George Rainsford (actor)|George Rainsford]]). [[Antoine Malick]] ([[Jimmy Akingbola]]) makes a video call to Arthur to wish him well.

Arthur goes to visit CEO [[Henrik Hanssen]] ([[Guy Henry (actor)|Guy Henry]]) and he tells him that he has finally realised what he wants from life. Arthur's stent bursts and he collapses on the floor. Hanssen calls a crash team and tries to comfort Arthur. [[Consultant (medicine)|Consultant]] [[Sacha Levy]] ([[Bob Barrett (actor)|Bob Barrett]]) and Ric try to operate on Arthur. Sacha announces that the cancer is too advanced and nothing more can be done and Ric agrees. Hanssen goes to AAU to inform Morven who is in theatre with [[Serena Campbell]] ([[Catherine Russell (actress)|Catherine Russell]]). Arthur is taken into a side room where Morven tells him that she loves him. Arthur is unconscious and has visions of Morven, Dom, Zosia and his old friend [[Chantelle Lane]] ([[Lauren Drummond]]). Arthur responds to Morven holding his hand but then dies surrounded by his friends and colleagues. Zosia breaks down on Darwin ward and Jac rushes to console her.

==Production==
The episode focuses around the final scenes of Rob Ostlere as Arthur Digby following three years in the show. The actor had informed producers of his decision to leave six months prior. They then devised an exit storyline for the character in which he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Ostlere was told of their intention to kill the character off, the results of which play out in "I'll Walk You Home".&lt;ref name=woti/&gt; The events of the episode could have been different as producer Simon Harper later gave Ostlere the chance to have his character leave the show alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Holby City producers reveal that Rob Ostlere could have saved his character Arthur Digby|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/holby-city/news/a796974/holby-city-rob-ostlere-arthur-digby-could-have-been-saved/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=8 June 2016|date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode was produced by Jane Wallbank, written by Andy Bayliss and directed by Paulette Randall.&lt;ref name=episode&gt;{{cite web|title=I'll Walk You Home|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07f72gb|website=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storyliners had been liaising with a consultant oncologist named Bruce Sizer who gave advice on the medical condition featured in the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur's last walk|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03xk5d1|website=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=8 June 2016|date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers structured the episode so it began "lovely and upbeat" until the closing scenes which contained Arthur's death.&lt;ref name=woti/&gt;

Former regular cast members Jimmy Akingbola and Lauren Drummond returned to filming especially for the episode, reprising their roles as Antoine Malick and Chantelle Lane respectively. Akingbola filmed scenes which were featured in a [[Skype]] video call. Drummond filmed scenes with other cast members, with her footage stylised as part of a dream sequence envisioned by Arthur.&lt;ref name=woti/&gt; The cast were involved in filming a number of dream sequences which were given a "surreal" feeling to them.&lt;ref name=wotint&gt;{{cite journal|title=Arthur's final journey|journal=[[What's on TV]]|date=4–10 June 2016|issue=22|pages=15|publisher=[[IPC Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Rainsford guest starred as Ethan Hardy, a character from ''Holby City's'' sister-show ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]''. His inclusion was a result of a decision made by executive producer Oliver Kent who oversees both shows. Rainsford and Ostlere had been asking Kent for the scenes for some time. The actors were friends for fourteen years and wanted their characters to share screen-time.&lt;ref name=woti&gt;{{cite web|title='It was a lovely, upbeat episode until Arthur's final moments!'

==Promotion==
Producers wanted to keep exact details of the episode a secret until it was broadcast. They also wanted to Akingbola and Drummond's involvement quiet to surprise viewers.&lt;ref name=insidesoap/&gt; Though Ostlere did disclose that past characters would return in an interview published via ''[[What's on TV]]''.&lt;ref name=wotint/&gt; Advance spoilers only indicated that Arthur and Morven planned to leave ''Holby City'' to go travelling and that Zosia and Jac would feature in scenes on the show's Darwin ward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Goodbye Arthur &amp; Morven?|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=4–10 June 2016|issue=22|pages=27|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show released a promotional trailer for the episode a week in advance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11670">'''I-''Cre''I''' is a [[homing endonuclease]] whose [[gene]] was first discovered in the [[chloroplast]] genome of ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'', a species of unicellular [[green algae]].&lt;ref name="rochaix"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rochaix | first1 = JD | last2 = Malnoe | first2 = P | year = 1978 | title = Anatomy of the chloroplast ribosomal DNA of ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'' | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 661–670 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(78)90034-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named for the facts that: it resides in an '''I'''ntron; it was isolated from '''''C'''lamydomonas '''re'''inhardtii''; it was the first ('''I''') such gene isolated from ''C. reinhardtii''. Its gene resides in a group I [[intron]] in the 23S [[ribosomal RNA]] gene of the ''C. reinhardtii'' chloroplast, and I-''Cre''I is only expressed when its [[mRNA]] is spliced from the [[transcription (genetics)|primary transcript]] of the 23S gene. I-''Cre''I [[enzyme]], which functions as a [[homodimer]], recognizes a 22-nucleotide sequence of duplex DNA and cleaves one phosphodiester bond on each strand at specific positions. I-''Cre''I is a member of the [[Homing endonuclease#Structural families|LAGLIDADG family]] of homing endonucleases, all of which have a conserved LAGLIDADG amino acid motif that contributes to their associative domains and active sites. When the I-''Cre''I-containing intron encounters a 23S gene lacking the intron, I-''Cre''I enzyme "homes" in on the "intron-minus" allele of 23S and effects its parent intron's insertion into the intron-minus allele. Introns with this behavior are called [[mobile introns]]. Because I-''Cre''I provides for its own propagation while conferring no benefit on its host, it is an example of [[selfish DNA]].

==Discovery==
I-''Cre''I was first observed as an [[intron|intervening sequence]] in the 23S [[rRNA]] gene of the ''C. reinhardtii'' chloroplast genome.&lt;ref name="rochaix" /&gt; The 23S gene is an [[RNA gene]], meaning that its transcript is not translated into protein. As RNA, it forms part of the large subunit of the [[ribosome]]. An open reading frame coding for a 163-amino acid protein was found in this 23S intron, suggesting that a protein might facilitate the homing behavior of the mobile intron. Furthermore, the predicted protein had a LAGLIDADG motif, a conserved amino acid sequence that is present in other proteins coded for in group I mobile introns. A 1991 study established that the ORF codes for a DNA endonuclease, I-''Cre''I, which selectively cuts a site corresponding to where the intron is spliced out of the 23S primary transcript.&lt;ref name="durrenberger"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dürrenberger | first1 = F | last2 = Rochaix | first2 = JD | year = 1991 | title = Chloroplast ribosomal intron of ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'': ''in vitro'' self-splicing, DNA endonuclease activity and ''in vivo'' mobility | journal = EMBO J | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 3495–3501 | pmid = 1915304 | pmc=453078}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also showed that the intron was able to invade 23S alleles that did not already have it.&lt;ref name="durrenberger" /&gt;

==Mechanism of propagation==
I-''Cre''I has evolved to cut a 22-nucleotide sequence of DNA that occurs in [[allele]]s of the 23S ribosomal RNA gene that lack the I-''Cre''I-containing intron. When such an "intron-minus" allele is cut, pathways of [[DNA repair#Double-strand breaks|double-strand break repair]] are activated in the cell. The cell uses as a template for repair the 23S allele that yielded the responsible I-''Cre''I enzyme, thus replicating the I-''Cre''I-containing intron.&lt;ref name="durrenberger2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dürrenberger | first1 = F | last2 = Thompson | first2 = AJ | last3 = Herrin | first3 = DL | last4 = Rochaix | first4 = JD | year = 1996 | title = Double strand break-induced recombination in ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'' chloroplasts | url = | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 3323–3331 | doi=10.1093/nar/24.17.3323}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting "intron-plus" allele no longer contains an intact homing site for the I-''Cre''I enzyme, and is therefore not cleaved. Since this intron provides for its own replication without conferring any benefit on its host, I-''Cre''I is a form of [[selfish DNA]].

==Structural studies and possible applications==
[[Image:cre crystal structure.png|right|thumbnail|400px|X-ray crystal structure of I-''Cre''I bound to its native homing site.&lt;ref name="jurica"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jurica | first1 = MS | last2 = Monnat | first2 = RJ | last3 = Stoddard | first3 = BL | year = 1998 | title = DNA Recognition and Cleavage by the LAGLIDADG Homing Endonuclease I-''Cre''I. | url = | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 469–476 | doi=10.1016/s1097-2765(00)80146-x | pmid=9809068}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] Because I-''Cre''I has evolved to cut such a long sequence of DNA, unlike [[restriction endonucleases]] that typically cut four- or six-nucleotide sequences, it is capable of cutting a single site within a very large [[genome]]. A four- or six-nucleotide sequence is expected to occur many, many times in a genome of millions or billions of nucleotides simply by chance, whereas a 22-nucleotide sequence might occur only once (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/4&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; vs. 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/4&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;). This specificity of I-''Cre''I cleavage makes I-''Cre''I a promising tool for [[gene therapy|gene targeting]]. If a person were to have a disease due to a defective [[allele]] of some [[gene]], it would be helpful to be able to replace that allele with a functional one. If one could cause I-''Cre''I to cut the DNA only in the defective allele while simultaneously providing a normal allele for the cell to use as a repair template, the patient's own [[homologous recombination]] machinery could insert the desired allele in place of the dysfunctional one. The specificity of I-''Cre''I also allows for the reduction of deleterious effects due to [[DNA repair#DNA repair mechanisms|double-strand breaks]] outside of the gene of interest.

In order to use I-''Cre''I as a tool in this fashion, it is necessary to make it recognize and cleave sequences of DNA different from its native homing site. An ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' genetic system for studying the relationship between I-''Cre''I structure and its homing site specificity was created in 1997.&lt;ref name="seligman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seligman | first1 = LM | last2 = Stephens | first2 = KM | last3 = Savage | first3 = JH | last4 = Monnat | first4 = RJ | year = 1997 | title = Genetic Analysis of the ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'' I-''Cre''I Mobile intron Homing System in ''Escherichia coli'' | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 147 | issue = | pages = 1653–1664 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the structure of the I-CreI protein was determined,&lt;ref name="pmid9187655"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Heath, P.| title = The structure of I-Crel, a group I intron-encoded homing endonuclease | journal = Nature Structural Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 6 |date=June 1997 | pages = 468–476 | pmid = 9187655 | doi=10.1038/nsb0697-468 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1998, its crystal structure  bound to its native DNA homing site was solved, greatly aiding research in altering the homing site recognition of the protein.&lt;ref name="jurica" /&gt; Mutant forms of the protein have since been created that exhibit altered homing site specificity.&lt;ref name="seligman2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seligman | first1 = LM | last2 = Chisholm | first2 = KM | last3 = Chevalier | first3 = BS | last4 = Chadsey | first4 = MS | last5 = Edwards | first5 = ST | last6 = Savage | first6 = JH | last7 = Veillet | first7 = AL | year = 2002 | title = Mutations altering the cleavage specificity of a homing endonuclease | url = | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 3870–3879 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkf495 | pmid=12202772 | pmc=137417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seligman3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sussman | first1 = D | last2 = Chadsey | first2 = M | last3 = Fauce | first3 = S | last4 = Engel | first4 = A | last5 = Bruett | first5 = A | last6 = Monnat | first6 = R | last7 = Stoddard | first7 = BL | last8 = Seligman | first8 = LM | year = 2004 | title = Isolation and Characterization of New Homing Endonuclease Specificities at Individual Target Site Positions | url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 342 | issue = | pages = 31–41 | doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2004.07.031 | pmid=15313605}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seligman4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosen | first1 = LE | last2 = Morrison | first2 = HA | last3 = Masri | first3 = S | last4 = Brown | first4 = MJ | last5 = Springstubb | first5 = B | last6 = Sussman | first6 = D | last7 = Stoddard | first7 = BL | last8 = Seligman | first8 = LM | year = 2006 | title = Homing endonuclease I-''Cre''I derivatives with novel DNA target specificities | url = | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 4791–4800 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkl645 | pmid=16971456 | pmc=1635285}}&lt;/ref&gt; A genetic system in ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' has also been created, yielding additional I-''Cre''I mutants with modified homing site specificities.&lt;ref name="arnould"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnould | first1 = S | last2 = Chames | first2 = P | last3 = Perez | first3 = C | last4 = Lacroix | first4 = E | last5 = Duclert | first5 = A | last6 = Epinat | first6 = JC | last7 = Stricher | first7 = F | last8 = Petit | first8 = AS | last9 = Patin | first9 = A | last10 = Guillier | first10 = S | last11 = Rolland | first11 = S | last12 = Prieto | first12 = J | last13 = Blanco | first13 = FJ | last14 = Bravo | first14 = J | last15 = Montoya | first15 = G | last16 = Serrano | first16 = L | last17 = Duchateau | first17 = P | last18 = Pâques | first18 = F | year = 2006 | title = Engineering of Large Numbers of Highly Specific Homing Endonucleases that Induce Recombination on Novel DNA Targets | url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 355 | issue = | pages = 443–458 | doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2005.10.065 | pmid=16310802}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = J | last2 = Grizot | first2 = S | last3 = Arnould | first3 = S | last4 = Duclert | first4 = A | last5 = Epinat | first5 = JC | last6 = Chames | first6 = P | last7 = Prieto | first7 = J | last8 = Redondo | first8 = P | last9 = Blanco | first9 = FJ | last10 = Bravo | first10 = J | last11 = Montoya | first11 = G | last12 = Pâques | first12 = F | last13 = Duchateau | first13 = P | year = 2006 | title = A combinatorial approach to create artificial homing endonucleases cleaving chosen sequences | url = | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34| pmc=1702487 | pmid=17130168 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkl720 | pages=e149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISEM could detect, if present, [[organic compound]]s, including evolving trace gases such as hydrocarbons like [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|methane in the Martian atmosphere]].&lt;ref name='Korablev 2017'/&gt; 

==Objectives==

The stated science objectives of ISEM are: &lt;ref name=IKI&gt;[http://www.planetary-department-iki.ru/projects/future/isem/ISEM_Overview.pdf ISEM (Infrared Spectrometer for ExoMars) - Overview] (PDF). [[Russian Space Research Institute]] (IKI).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Geological investigation and study a composition of Martian soils in the uppermost few millimeters of the surface.
* Characterisation of the composition of surface materials, discriminating between various classes of silicates, oxides, hydrated minerals and carbonates.
* Identification and mapping of the distribution of aqueous alteration products on Mars.
* Real-­‐time assessment of surface composition in selected areas, in support of identifying and selection of the most promising drilling sites. 
* Studies of variations of the atmospheric dust properties and of the atmospheric gaseous composition. 

==Development==

ISEM is a derivative of the Lunar Infrared Spectrometer (LIS) being developed by the [[Russian Space Research Institute]] (IKI) in Moscow for the planned [[Luna-25]] and [[Luna-27]] Russian landers.&lt;ref name='Korablev 2017'/&gt; Collaborating institutions include: [[Moscow State University]], Main Astrophysical Observatory, [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]], the National Research Institute for Physicotechnical and Radio Engineering Measurements (VNIIFTRI) in Russia, [[Moscow State University]], and the [[Aberystwyth University]] in United Kingdom. The science team includes researchers from Russia, France, Italy, Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Canada.&lt;ref name='Korablev 2017'/&gt;

The instrument has been designed to specifically detect carbonates, oxalates, borates, [[nitrates]], NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-bearing minerals, that are good indicators of past [[Planetary habitability|habitable conditions]] such as aqueous minerals. It is also designed to detect [[organic compounds]], including [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs) and those containing [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] C-H molecules.&lt;ref name='Korablev 2017'/&gt; In addition, ISEM can also detect seasonal frost, if present at the landing site, and it can be used to analse the bore hole excavated by the ExoMars drill, if the rover backs away some distance.&lt;ref name='Korablev 2017'/&gt;

The term '''insectoid''' denotes any creature or object that shares a similar body or traits with common earth [[insect]]s and [[arachnid]]s. The term is a combination of "insect" and "-oid" (a suffix denoting similarity).

==Description==
===Technology===
In [[technology]], insectoid robots such as [[hexapod (robotics)|hexapods]] have been designed for scientific or military uses. Research continues to miniaturize these robots to be used as flying spies or scouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news140850742.html|title=Scientists developing small robotic drones to become part of Air Force's arsenal|publisher=[[PhysOrg]]|date=2008-09-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920201213/http://www.physorg.com/news140850742.html|archivedate=2008-09-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insectoid features may also increase the effectiveness of robots in traversing various terrains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/future-tech/insectoid-robot-mimics-animal-walking-styles-153143|title=Insectoid robot mimics animal walking styles|publisher=[[TechRadar]]|date=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In ufology ==
In [[ufology]], insectoid aliens are alleged [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] beings which have a similar body with earth [[insect]]s or [[arachnid]]s. These beings are involved in [[alien encounter]]s and [[alien abduction]] scenarios but their presence is not as widely reported as [[Nordic aliens]] and [[Grey aliens]].

Before 1990 the UFO literature reported for insectoid aliens only the case concerning the [[Mothman]].&lt;br&gt; In 1992, the alien abduction researcher Brian Thompson claims that a nurse acquaintance of his reported that during 1957 in Cincinnati she encountered a {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} [[praying mantis]]-like entity two days after a V-shaped [[UFO]] sighting. This mantis-like creature is reminiscent of the insectoid-type entity reported in some abduction accounts. He related this report to fellow researcher [[Leonard Stringfield]]. Stringfield told him of two cases he had in his files where separate witnesses reported identical circumstances in the same place and year.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Pritchard, David E. Pritchard, John E. Mack, Pam Kasey, Claudia Yapp- ''Alien Discussion: Proceeding  of the Abduction Study Conference Held at M.I.T. Cambridge'', North Cambridge Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Abduction researcher Karla Turner in the book ''Into the fringe'' reported that a man called David remembered an encounter with a giant mantis during an hypnosis session.&lt;ref&gt;Karla Turner, ''Into the fringe'', Berkley Books, New York, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linda Moulton Howe]] in the book ''Glimpses of Other Realities'' describes some claims of alien mantis. The book includes the cases of Linda Porter and David Huggins. In 1988 Linda Porter remembered an abduction by alien mantis which she said took place when she was a child. In the same year 1988 David Huggins remembered an encounter with alien mantis that he said took place in the 1950's, when he was a child. The book report also the case of Jeanne Robinson, which said she have received messages by an alien similar to a mantis. According to Ms Robinson, these aliens are a branch of [[Greys]].&lt;ref&gt;Linda Howe, ''Glimpses of Other Realities'', ''Vol. I: Fact and Eyewitness'', LMH,1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linda Howe, ''Glimpses of Other Realities'', ''Vol. II: High Strangeness'', Paper Chase press, New Orleans, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards some fringe of ufologists involved insectoid aliens in [[UFO conspiracy theories]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Goldwag, ''Cults, Conpiracies &amp; Secret Societies'', First Vintage Books Editions, 2009, pp. 136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;The skeptic ufologist Martin Kottmeyer argue the phenomenon of mantis alien may be explained by the effects of cultural factors  such as [[science fiction]] films where these beings are protagonists.&lt;ref&gt;Martin S. Kottmeyer, ''Bugs Baroque'', UFO Magazine, July/August 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
Insect-like creatures have been a part of the tradition of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]]. In the 1902 film ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'', [[Georges Méliès]] portrayed the Selenites of the moon as insectoid.&lt;ref name="Creed2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Creed|first=Barbara|title=Darwin's Screens: Evolutionary Aesthetics, Time and Sexual Display in the Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gTV9jLGsOFQC&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=31 March 2014|date=2009|publisher=Academic Monographs|isbn=9780522852585|pages=47–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Olaf Stapledon]] incorporates insectoids in his 1937 ''[[Star Maker]]'' novel.&lt;ref name="Prucher2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prucher|first=Jeff|title=Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lJCS0reqmFUC&amp;pg=PA99|accessdate=31 March 2014|date=2007-03-21|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=9780199885527|pages=99–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the pulp fiction novels, insectoid creatures were frequently used as the antagonists threatening the [[damsel in distress]].&lt;ref name="Caroti2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Caroti|first=Simone|title=The Generation Starship in Science Fiction: A Critical History, 1934-2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lKRN9pFu5lwC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=31 March 2014|date=2011-04-14|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786485765|pages=63–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later depictions of the hostile insect aliens include the antagonists in [[Robert A.

An '''extradimensional being''' or intelligence (also '''intra-dimensional'''&lt;ref name="synonyms"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coppens|first=Philip|title=The Ancient Alien Question: A New Inquiry Into the Existence, Evidence, and Influence of Ancient Visitors|date=2012|publisher=New Page Books, A Division of The Career Press, Inc|location=Pompton Plains, NJ|isbn=978-1-60163-628-7|pages=126, 268, 273, and 274 in the e-book version. The term "intra-dimensional" was suggested by George Lucas (pg. 126)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''other-dimensional'''&lt;ref name="synonyms"  /&gt;) is a type of theoretical or a real entity  in a [[dimension]] beyond our own. Such beings are common in science fiction, fantasy and supernatural fiction. 

== Nonfiction ==

== Fiction ==

=== Implementation of dimensional portals ===
In the [[Star Trek]] universe, [[wormhole]] theory states that if a section in the fabric of spacetime joins together with another section of spacetime, a direct connection can be made between the two, allowing speedy travel between the two (normally unrelated) spacetime coordinates. [[Black hole]]s are one such way of stretching the fabric of spacetime; so it's theoretically possible to create wormholes
using a pair of [[Gravitational singularity|singularities]], at least in the fictional universe of Star Trek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yakuprising.net/pdf/BlackHolesPaper.pdf|title=Black Holes in Star Trek: Science Fact and Fiction}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NASA]] Web site has a somewhat dated article called "The Science of Star Trek", by physicist David Allen Batchelor (5 May 2009), which considers some of the implementations in Star Trek. He says it's "the only science fiction series crafted with such respect for real science and intelligent writing", with some "imaginary science" mixed in; and considers it to be the "only science fiction series that many scientists watch regularly", like himself. He says it's "more faithful to science than any other science fiction series ever shown on television".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Batchelor|first=David|title=The Science of Star Trek|url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/features/star_trek.html|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Universe dimensionality ===
An additional fictional work that does include universe dimensionality of some sort includes the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]] series, according to a particular academic source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seven Seasons of Buffy|publisher=BenBella Books|author=Glenn Yeffeth|isbn=978-1-932100-08-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In literature ===

==== The Time Machine (H. G. Wells) ====
[[The Time Machine]] by [[H. G. Wells]] describes [[time travel]]ers as interdimensionally capable.

The protagonist describes the passing of time, and also treats it as if it were a spatial dimension. This is exactly how H. G. Wells devises the time machine mechanism in this particular work of fiction. H. G. Wells supposes that if time could simply be treated as space, then time machines would indeed operate correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/35/pg35.html|title=The Time Machine by H. G. Wells – Full Text}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the H. G. Wells definition of a time traveler must be equivalent to that of an interdimensional being – an entity capable of traveling through unusual dimensional rifts that few other entities can enter.

From H. G. Wells' Work: 'Clearly,' the Time Traveller proceeded, 'any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration. But through a natural infirmity of the [[flesh]], which I will explain to you in a moment, we incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three [[dimensions]] and the [[latter]], because it happens that our [[consciousness]] moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives.

==== The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Douglas Adams) ====
[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] by [[Douglas Adams]] describes that [[mice]] are 'merely the protrusion into our dimension of vast hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings.' The old man, [[Slartibartfast]], from [[Magrathea]] told the protagonist, Arthur, that the planet he lived on, Earth, 'was commissioned, paid for, and run by mice.' and that the mice were furious when it was destroyed.

==== Flatland ====
[[Flatland]] by [[Edwin Abbott Abbott]] describes the interactions of a [[two-dimensional space|two-dimensional]] [[square]] with an interdimensional being from a coexisting [[Three-dimensional_space|three-dimensional]] [[spacetime]].

'''''It's a Wise Child''''' is a fictional talk show featured in many of [[J.D. Salinger]]'s stories of the [[Glass family]].  All of the Glass children were featured in the show, and it is said that the combined income from the show sent the seven children through college.&lt;ref&gt;Salinger, J.D. "Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters", page 8. Little, Brown and Company, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinger was almost certainly aware of [[Telemachus]]’ consciously cryptic reply to [[Athena]] when she questions him about [[Odysseus]]: "It's a wise child that knows its own father." This oblique reference to ''[[The Odyssey]]'' emphasizes the quest for identity on which each of the Glass children has at some point embarked.
&lt;ref&gt;Galoway, David. "The absurd hero in American fiction: Updike, Styron, Bellow, Salinger." 2nd rev. ed. Austin: University of Texas,  1981, page 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles John Holt Jr.'''&lt;ref&gt;Source Citation: Year: 1900; Census Place: Bronx, New York, New York; Roll: 1127; Page: 17A; line 15; Enumeration District: 1041; FHL microfilm: 1241127.&lt;/ref&gt; (May 31, 1888 &amp;ndash; January 18, 1951) was an American [[motion picture]] [[actor]] in both silent and sound movies, particularly [[Westerns]].

==Early life==
Born in 1888 in [[Winchester, Virginia]], Holt was the son of an Episcopal priest.&lt;ref name="w"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glenn|first1=Justin|title=The Washingtons. Volume 7, Part 1: Generation Eleven of the Presidential Branch|date=2016|publisher=Savas Publishing|isbn=9781940669328|pages=210-211|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4bx6DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=%22Elizabeth+Marshall+Holt%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCyv7uh6TYAhVF6SYKHdfzCGwQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Elizabeth%20Marshall%20Holt%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in [[New York City|Manhattan]], he attended [[Trinity School (New York)|Trinity School]]. He was accepted into the [[Virginia Military Institute]] in 1909,&lt;ref&gt;http://www9.vmi.edu/archiverosters/show.asp?page=details&amp;ID=5590&amp;rform=search; viewed 1/18/2014&lt;/ref&gt; but expelled for misbehavior in his second semester there.&lt;ref name="w" /&gt; 

Following Holt's father's death, the family moved to New York City, where Jack, his mother, and brother Marshall lived with his married sister, Frances.&lt;ref name="w" /&gt; 

Holt worked at various jobs including construction of the Pennsylvania Railroad's tunnel under the Hudson River and being a "surveyor, laborer, prospector, trapper, and stagecoach driver, among many other jobs" during an almost six-year stay in Alaska.&lt;ref name="w" /&gt;

== Military service ==
Holt was prevented from serving in World War I because of "chronic foot problems" that resulted from frostbite that he suffered during his time in Alaska.&lt;ref name="w" /&gt; At the start of [[World War II]], he enlisted in the [[United States Army]] at the age of 54, at the request of [[General officer|General]] [[George Marshall|George C. Marshall]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; so that Holt could be a horse buyer for the [[United States Cavalry]].

==Film career==
[[File:Lila Lee Jack Holt 1921.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lila Lee]] is embraced by Holt in a publicity still for [[William C. deMille]]'s 1921 silent drama ''After the Show''.]]
Holt began in [[Hollywood]] with [[Stunt performer|stunt]] work and [[Bit player|bit]] parts in [[Serial film|serials]] and at [[Universal Pictures]] worked as a supporting player for [[Francis Ford (actor)|Francis Ford]] and his brother [[John Ford]], and [[Grace Cunard]].

In his film debut, Holt rode a horse down a steep embankment into the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]] in a scene for [[Salomy Jane (1914 film)|''Salomy Jane'']]. The stunt cracked some of Holt's ribs and injured the horse so badly that it had to be destroyed. The film, which was considered lost for years, was included in the DVD released 2011 anthology ''Treasures 5 The West 1898—1938'' by the [[National Film Preservation Foundation]] after a print was discovered in Australia.&lt;ref name="w" /&gt;  

Holt's dapper mustache, prominent jaw, and quick-with-his-fists manner, personified [[Masculinity|rugged masculinity]]. Holt became [[Columbia Pictures]]' most reliable [[leading man]], and scored personal successes in three [[Frank Capra]] action dramas:  ''[[Submarine (1928 film)|Submarine]]'' (1928), ''[[Flight (1929 film)|Flight]]'' (1929) and ''[[Dirigible (film)|Dirigible]]'' (1931). Holt's no-nonsense characterizations were eclipsed by younger, tough-talking actors like [[James Cagney]] and [[Chester Morris]], although he continued to work low-budget action features, mostly for Columbia through 1940. It came to an end when he argued with studio chief [[Harry Cohn]] who thought the actor so arrogant that he committed him to a secondary role in a 15-chapter [[Serial film|serial]] ''[[Holt of the Secret Service]]'' (1941) with accompanying publicity to introduce him to that new type of film product audience but he left Columbia for other studios.

[[File:Jack Holt-Seena Owen in Victory.jpg|thumb|right|Jack Holt and Seena Owen in ''Victory'']]He would become an enduring member of that cowboy fraternity through ''[[Trail of Robin Hood]]'' (1950) joining others: [[Roy Rogers]], [[Allan Lane]], [[Tom Keene (actor)|Tom Keene]], [[Tom Tyler]], [[Kermit Maynard]], and [[Rex Allen]]. His children established their own film careers: [[Tim Holt]] in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948), with Jack as a grubby [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrant]] and [[Jennifer Holt]], mostly in Universal Pictures westerns. They performed together on the "Drifty" episode of "All Star Western Theater" ([[KNX (radio station)|KNX]]-[[CBS Radio|CBS]] Pacific Network, 1946/47) as a father/son/daughter trio featuring a dramatic sketch and additional entertainment by [[Foy Willing]] and the [[Riders of the Purple Sage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All-Star Western Theatre|url=http://www.radioarchives.com/All_Star_Western_Theatre_p/ra174.htm|website=Radio Archives|accessdate=25 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529232826/http://www.radioarchives.com/All_Star_Western_Theatre_p/ra174.htm|archivedate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Holt married divorcee Margaret Wood in 1917. Her father, tycoon Henry Morton Stanley-Wood, disowned her because she married an actor; they later made up after he had lost most of his money in the Great Depression. She had a daughter when they married, and together they had a son, Charles John Holt III, and a daughter, Elizabeth Marshall Holt. Better known as [[Tim Holt|Tim]] and [[Jennifer Holt|Jennifer]], respectively, both of them became actors in western films.&lt;ref name="w" /&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Bessie Barriscale Howard Hickman Jack Holt 1919.jpg|thumb|right|Original caption: "[[Howard C. Hickman]], husband and director of [[Bessie Barriscale]], shows leading man Jack Holt how to make love to Mrs. Hickman." This appears to be a production still from ''Kitty Kelly, M.D.'' (1919). If so, the cameraman behind the [[Bell &amp; Howell]] model 2709 is [[Eugene Gaudio]].]]
Jack Holt died in 1951 of a [[heart attack]].&lt;ref&gt;http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/jack-holt/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contribution==
Jack Holt has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6313-½ [[Hollywood Boulevard|Hollywood Blvd]] for his contribution to the motion picture industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/jack-holt|title=Jack Holt {{!}} Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=www.walkoffame.com|access-date=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holt was the visual inspiration for [[Chester Gould|Chester Gould's]] "[[Dick Tracy]]" and [[Al Capp|Al Capp's]] "[[Fearless Fosdick]]."

[[Margaret Mitchell]], although having no say in the casting for ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'' (1939), expressed her preference of Jack Holt as [[Rhett Butler]], because her personal favorite, [[Charles Boyer]], had a French accent.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Edwards, ''Road to Tara: The Life of Margaret Mitchell'' (New Haven and New York: Ticknor and Fields, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Delamere Lafferty''' (April 28, 1849 &amp;ndash; July 29, 1920) was a Canadian physician and politician.  He served one term as the fifth mayor of the town of [[Calgary]], [[District of Alberta|Alberta]] from January 20, 1890 to January 19, 1891.

Lafferty was born in [[Perth, Ontario]] in 1849 and attended local schools. He then worked as deputy registrar of titles in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] to finance his further education. He graduated from [[Queen's University, Kingston|Queen's University]] medical school in 1871. Lafferty practised medicine for a year in Perth before becoming a senior resident at Ward Island hospital (later [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue Hospital]]) in [[New York City]] and at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. Lafferty next took a post-graduate course at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] in [[London]], England.&lt;ref name=lampard/&gt;

In 1873, he set up practice in [[Pembroke, Ontario]]; later that same year, he married Jessie P. Grant. From 1877 to 1880, Lafferty also operated a drug store in Pembroke. In 1880, he was named associate [[coroner]] for [[Renfrew County, Ontario|Renfrew County]]. The following year, Lafferty was offered the position of chief surgeon for the eastern division of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) and moved to [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]] later that year. Lafferty and his family had moved to [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] by 1885 and then moved on to Calgary in December 1885.&lt;ref name=lampard&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.robertlampard.ca/Books/Alberta%27s%20Medical%20History.pdf#Lafferty |title=Alberta’s Medical History |last=Lampard |first=Robert |year=2008 |ISBN=978-0-9810382-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Calgary, Lafferty took on the contracts to provide medical services for the CPR mainline and for the nearby Indian reservation. In 1889, he was a founding member of the North West Territories Medical Association and, in the following year, was elected to the medical council for the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the North West Territories. He served on the council until 1906, also serving three terms as president. In 1901, he became medical registrar for the North West Territories. When the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were formed, Lafferty drafted the Medical Profession
Acts for both provinces. In 1906, he organized the meeting which formed the [[Alberta Medical Association]]. Later that same year, he organized the first meeting of the [[Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons]]. Lafferty served as Registrar-Treasurer for the college until 1911. From 1907 to 1910, he served as chair of the Provincial Board of Health. He also served as first president of the Calgary Medical Society. Lafferty retired from the practice of medicine in 1909 but served as a hospital inspector from 1909 until 1918 (or possibly later).&lt;ref name=lampard/&gt;

Lafferty was also involved in the operation of a chain of private banks in western Canada known as the Lafferty and Smith Banks in partnership with Frederick G. Smith. He left that partnership in 1889 and formed the Lafferty and Moore Bank. In 1893, Lafferty and Moore was acquired by the [[Bank of Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=tegmLyZHPHcC&amp;pg=PA122 |title=Eye on the Future: Business People in Calgary and the Bow Valley, 1870-1900 |pages=122–32 |last=Klassen |first=Henry C |year=2002 |ISBN=1552380785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lafferty ran for the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] in the provisional district of [[Alberta (Provisional District)|Alberta]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1887|1887 Canadian federal election]], but lost out to [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] Donald Watson Davis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/FederalRidingsHistory/hfer.asp?Language=E&amp;Search=Det&amp;Include=Y&amp;rid=7 |title=Alberta (Provisional District), Northwest Territories (1886 - 1908) |work=History of Federal Ridings since 1867 |publisher=Parliament of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The persons (or entire families) subject to it are [[shunning|shunned]] by their local community.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Belford|first=Aubrey|title=Customary Law Revival Neglects Some Balinese|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html|accessdate=12 October 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the most severe sentence imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils, which also impose lesser sanctions such as fines or public shaming. According to a 2010 ''[[New York Times]]'' report describing the increasing importance of customary law in Indonesia since 1998, "in a society where the entire cycle of life and religion is tied to ancestral villages, kasepekang is likened to a social and spiritual death sentence."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

'''Michel Fournier''' (born 9 May 1944) is a [[France|French]] [[Adventurer#Adventurers|adventurer]] and retired [[French Air Force|Air Force]] colonel. He has been involved in planning attempts to break [[freefall]] jumping height records, but has yet to be successful in carrying out an attempt. He was born in [[Treban]] ([[Allier]]), in the [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]] region of [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legrandsaut.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=121&amp;Itemid=132&amp;lang=en |title=The man: Michel Fournier|publisher=Le Grand Saut project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parachuting experience==
According to the French version of his own biography, he (Michel Fournier) claims to have a total of more than 8,700 jumps in 2011, including a French record of height in [[freefall]] at 12,000 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legrandsaut.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=121&amp;Itemid=132&amp;lang=fr|title=Michel Fournier|publisher=Le Grand Saut project|language=fr|accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, his parachuting experience was disputed by [[Patrick de Gayardon]]&lt;ref name="Paramag 125"&gt;Paramag #125, October 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
and the magazine Paramag.&lt;ref name="Paramag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paramag.nuxit.net/online/news/telecharge/icono_254.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306075602/http://paramag.nuxit.net/online/news/telecharge/icono_254.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-03-06|title=Le grand saut|first=Yves-Marie|last=Guillaud|date=July 2008|work=paramag.nuxit.net|publisher=''Paramag''|language=fr|accessdate=February 28, 2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; No official institution has ever confirmed one of his titles.&lt;ref name="ParamagCompl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paramag.nuxit.net/online/news/telecharge/complem-icono-juillet.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306044913/http://paramag.nuxit.net/online/news/telecharge/complem-icono-juillet.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 6, 2009|title=Complément d'information Paramag|publisher=''Paramag''|language=fr|accessdate=February 28, 2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Le Grand Saut==
Fournier has attempted to make record breaking [[freefall]] jumps on three occasions. In 1998, the French space agency chose Fournier to conduct a record jump to test the ability of  astronauts to survive reentry without a space craft. This project was quickly canceled. In 2003, Fournier attempted his first privately financed jump but the balloon ripped while being filled. The ''New York Times'' reports that Fournier has spent "nearly $20 million" on his two private attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=20-Year Journey for 15-Minute Fall|work=New York Times|first= Matt|last= Higgins|date=  May 24, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/24/sports/othersports/24jump.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fournier was scheduled to carry out the ''Grand Saut'' (Big Jump) project in May 2008, which would have seen him ascend to {{convert|40|km|mi}} in a balloon and freefall {{convert|34|km|mi}} to earth before opening his parachute at {{convert|6|km|mi}} to go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=French skydiver prepares for record jump from 40km up|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/05/26/2255683.htm|date=26 May 2008|publisher=ABC News Online|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process he was expected to attain a speed in freefall faster than the speed of sound,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/1774130.stm|title=Skydiver to break sound barrier| publisher=BBC |date=22 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reach speeds upward of {{convert|1000|mph|km/h}}. His freefall was expected to last 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[[CBC Radio]] 1 newscast, 8{{nbsp}}am 26 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; If successful, this would have broken records previously held by [[Joseph Kittinger]], who set the previous parachute record by jumping from {{convert|31333|m|ft|0}} in 1960 (with a small parachute for stability) under [[Project Excelsior]]; and [[Eugene Andreyev]] from the [[Soviet Union]], who jumped from {{convert|24483|m|ft|0}} in 1962, setting the longest free fall record.

The jump was expected to take place over the plains of [[Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]]. After several delays due to weather, the attempt was made on 27 May 2008, but the balloon detached from its capsule as it was being inflated and floated away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7421435.stm|title=Jump record fails to take flight |publisher=BBC |date=27 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another attempt was made on 16 May 2010 which was unsuccessful due to the skydiver's reserve parachute deploying inside the capsule during a pre-launch test while the balloon was being filled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/aviation/airships/sky-diving-record-attempt|title=Michel Fournier Free Fall Attempt|publisher=Popular Mechanics|date=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next attempt was announced for May 2011, delayed until August and then apparently postponed to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

'''Milt''' is the [[semen|seminal]] fluid of [[fish]], [[Mollusca|mollusks]], and certain other water-dwelling animals who reproduce by spraying this fluid which contains the [[sperm]], onto [[roe]] (fish eggs).

==Milt as food==
Milt or '''soft roe''' also refers to the male [[Sex organ|genitalia]] of fish when they contain sperm, used as food. Many cultures eat milt, often fried, though not usually as a dish by itself.

In [[Japanese cuisine]], the milt (白子 ''shirako'' 'white children') of [[cod]] (''tara''),  [[anglerfish]] (''ankō''), [[salmon]] (''sake''), [[squid]] (''ika'') and [[pufferfish]] (''[[fugu]]'') are a delicacy.

In [[Korean cuisine]], the milt ({{lang|ko|이리}} ''iri'') of [[Alaska pollock]], [[cod]], [[Lophiomus setigerus|blackmouth angler]], [[bogeo]], and [[Sparidae|sea bream]] are considered delicacy.

In [[Romanian cuisine]], the milt of [[carp]] and other fresh water fish is called "Lapți" (from the Latin word "Lactes") and is usually fried.

In [[Russian cuisine]], herring milt (молока, "Moloka") is pickled the same way as the rest of the fish, but eaten separately, sometimes combined with pickled herring roe. Various [[whitefish (fisheries term)|whitefish]] soft roes are usually consumed fried and it is an inexpensive everyday dish.

In [[Sicilian cuisine]], the milt of [[tuna]] is called "Lattume" and is used as a typical pasta topping.

'''''Monster Rancher''''', known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Monster Farm'''''|モンスターファーム|Monsutā Fāmu}}, is a series of [[Life simulation game|life simulation]] [[role-playing video game]]s created by Tecmo (now [[Koei Tecmo]]). The series currently consists of fourteen games across different [[video game platforms]]. In addition, the series has been adapted into an [[Monster Rancher (anime)|anime]].

==Story==
Before the world's continents broke up into pieces, a huge disaster hit the world. People prayed to God for help, and God created new life forms. However, new life forms brought new troubles, so God became exasperated and sealed them in "disc stones". Many years have passed since then and God entrusted the humans with the secret of "disc stones". Today people still continue searching for these missing "disc stones" to unlock the lifeforms within.

It is said that the "disc stones" are almost impossible to find among the ancient ruins. It is said that one monster is trapped inside each one. One day a group of workers excavating the ancient ruins happened to dig up one of these mythical disc stones. The worker who first discovered a disc stone took the disc to the Monsters' Temple. There the priests, using the ancient methods, unlocked the monster inside the disc stone. In a place where ranchers and monsters coexisted peacefully, the battle of the monsters began! As time passed these monster battles became extremely popular, and monster breeding became the standard pastime of the land. Eventually disc stones were found around the entire world. Now ranchers across the globe come together and enter battle.

==Games==
''Monster Rancher'' is often compared to ''[[Pokémon]]'', though the two series play differently. While the ''Pokémon'' games are traditionally collection-based [[role-playing video game|RPG]]s, ''Monster Rancher'' games tend to be simulated [[animal breeding]] games. The [[genre]] ''Monster Rancher'' occupies is shared by other simulation [[virtual pet]] games, such as ''[[Digimon]]'', and games based on raising horses for racing, like in the ''[[Gallop Racer]]'' series, also by Tecmo.

In the games, one takes the role of a monster [[breeder]] whose goal is to raise monsters to fight in tournaments. The breeder must take it in hand to raise the monster throughout its life, training it, keeping it healthy, making an exercise schedule, and trying to maximize its abilities before it dies of old age or is [[retirement|retired]]. Monsters have good or bad morale depending on how they are raised; loyal monsters are more likely to perform [[critical hit]]s, while disloyal monsters might refuse to obey commands or not fight at all. Retired monsters can be combined to create more powerful monsters.

===Monster generation===
Although not widely popular, the games do have a loyal [[cult following]], mostly because of the games' innovative "unlocking" aspect. In ''[[Monster Rancher (video game)|Monster Rancher]]'', ''[[Monster Rancher 2]]'', ''[[Monster Rancher 3]]'', ''[[Monster Rancher 4]]'', and ''[[Monster Rancher EVO]]'', monsters can be generated by inserting any CD into the game system.'' [[Monster Rancher 3]]'', ''[[Monster Rancher 4]]'', and ''[[Monster Rancher EVO]]'' can also use DVDs.

The characteristics of the monster (such as stats, breed and traits) are determined by various numbers stored in the game. To generate a monster, a [[random number generator]] is needed to define what characteristics the monster will have. TECMO created a CD-reading system that would use the discs to generate random number seeds and, consequently, a large variety of random monsters. The values found in the discs' data are [[Map (mathematics)|mapped]] to monster characteristics.

Some discs are designed to produce specific monsters, often thematically related to the disc in question. For instance, in ''[[Monster Rancher 4]]'', the ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' DVD (as well as the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|tie-in PlayStation 2 game]]) generates a unique owl monster, and in ''[[Monster Rancher 2]]'' and ''[[Monster Rancher 4]]'', TECMO's ''[[Dead or Alive (video game)|Dead or Alive]]'' game creates a Pixie named [[Kasumi (Dead or Alive)|Kasumi]]. In ''Monster Rancher 2'', the ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'' DVD generates a unique squid-like creature. Special CDs, called ''pandora discs'', can produce multiple monsters. Often, the Monster Rancher game CD itself is a ''pandora disc''.

In ''[[Monster Rancher Advance]]'' and ''[[Monster Rancher Advance 2]]'', the system generates random monsters by using character sequences rather than CDs, due to the limitations of the [[Game Boy Advance]] [[game cartridge]]s. Certain combinations of characters will determine the monster's breed, sub-breed, stats, and traits. Codes found in-game can be used to generate rare monsters.

In ''[[Monster Rancher DS]]'' and ''Monster Rancher DS 2'', the system is revised to take advantage of the [[Nintendo DS]]'s input devices. Monsters can be generated by speaking into the microphone, drawing figures on the bottom screen, or inserting a [[Game Boy Advance]] game cartridge into the second slot.

For ''Monster Farm Online'', the unlocking system is changed entirely. Players select a monster species they have some knowledge of, with the basic purebreeds automatically available, and insert a CD or DVD to create their traits. This is so that players do not need to find a disc that is unique to one particular territory to get the rarest monsters.

Moral philosophy includes moral [[ontology]], which is the origin of morals; and [[moral epistemology]], which studies the knowledge of morals. Different systems of expressing morality have been proposed, including [[Deontological ethics|deontological ethical]] systems which adhere to a set of established rules, and [[Normative ethics|normative]] ethical systems which consider the merits of actions themselves. An example of normative ethical philosophy is the [[Golden Rule]], which states that: "One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself."&lt;ref name = "Flew"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=golden rule|editor =[[Antony Flew]] | encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Philosophy | publisher = [[Pan Books]] in association with [[Macmillan Publishers|The MacMillan Press]] | year = 1979 | location = London | page = 134 | isbn = 9780333262047|quote=The maxim 'Treat others how you wish to be treated'. Various expressions of this fundamental moral rule are to be found in tenets of most religions and creeds through the ages, testifying to its universal applicability. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Walter Terence Stace]] argued that the Golden Rule is much more than simply an [[ethics|ethical code]]. He posits that it "express[es] the essence of a universal morality." The rationale for this distinction occupies much of his book ''The Concept of Morals'' (1937). {{cite book | last = Stace | first = Walter T. | title = The Concept of Morals | publisher = The MacMillan Company; reprinted by Peter Smith Publisher Inc, January 1990 | date = 1937 | location = New York | page = 136 | isbn = 0-8446-2990-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immorality]] is the active opposition to morality (i.e. opposition to that which is [[good]] or right), while [[amorality]] is variously defined as an unawareness of, indifference toward, or disbelief in any particular set of moral standards or principles.&lt;ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

===Ethics&lt;!--'Morality and ethics' redirects here--&gt;===
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]] introduced the [[categorical imperative]]: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law".]]
{{Main|Ethics}}
{{see also|Sittlichkeit}}

Ethics (also known as moral philosophy) is the branch of [[philosophy]] which addresses questions of morality. The word "ethics" is "commonly used interchangeably with 'morality,' and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group, or individual."&lt;ref&gt;John Deigh in Robert Audi (ed), ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, certain types of ethical theories, especially [[deontological ethics]], sometimes distinguish between ethics and morals: "Although the morality of people and their ethics amounts to the same thing, there is a usage that restricts morality to systems such as that of [[Immanuel Kant]], based on notions such as duty, obligation, and [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] of conduct, reserving ethics for the more [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] approach to practical reasoning, based on the notion of a [[virtue]], and generally avoiding the separation of 'moral' considerations from other practical considerations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-link=Simon Blackburn|last = Blackburn|first = Simon |title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]|edition = 2nd|date = 2008|page = 240|isbn = 978-0199541430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descriptive and normative===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
In its descriptive sense, "morality" refers to [[Value (personal and cultural)|personal or cultural values]], [[code of conduct|codes of conduct]] or social [[mores]] from a society that provides these codes of conduct in which it applies and is accepted by an individual. It does not connote objective claims of right or wrong, but only refers to that which is considered right or wrong. [[Descriptive ethics]] is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense.&lt;ref name="Gert"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/morality-definition/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Gert|first=Bernard|last2=Gert|first2=Joshua|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its [[normative]] sense, "morality" refers to whatever (if anything) is ''actually'' right or wrong, which may be independent of the values or mores held by any particular peoples or cultures. [[Normative ethics]] is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense.&lt;ref name="Gert"/&gt;

===Realism and anti-realism===
Philosophical theories on the nature and origins of morality (that is, theories of [[meta-ethics]]) are broadly divided into two classes:
* [[Moral realism]] is the class of theories which hold that there are true moral statements that report objective moral facts. For example, while they might concede that forces of social [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]] significantly shape individuals' "moral" decisions, they deny that those cultural [[norm (sociology)|norms]] and [[convention (norm)|customs]] define morally right behavior. This may be the philosophical view propounded by [[ethical naturalism|ethical naturalists]], however not all moral realists accept that position (e.g. [[ethical non-naturalism|ethical non-naturalists]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Chapouthier|Chapouthier, Georges]], "To what extent is moral judgment natural?", ''European Review'' (GB), 2004, 12(2): 179–83&lt;/ref&gt;
* Moral [[anti-realism]], on the other hand, holds that moral statements either fail or do not even attempt to report objective moral facts. Instead, they hold that moral sentences are either categorically false claims of objective moral facts ([[error theory]]); claims about subjective attitudes rather than objective facts ([[ethical subjectivism]]); or else not attempts to describe the world at all but rather something else, like an expression of an emotion or the issuance of a command ([[non-cognitivism]]).

Some forms of non-cognitivism and ethical subjectivism, while considered anti-realist in the robust sense used here, are considered realist in the sense synonymous with [[moral universalism]]. For example, [[universal prescriptivism]] is a universalist form of non-cognitivism which claims that morality is derived from reasoning about implied imperatives, and [[divine command theory]] and [[ideal observer theory]] are universalist forms of ethical subjectivism which claim that morality is derived from the edicts of a god or the hypothetical decrees of a perfectly rational being, respectively.

==Anthropology==

===Tribal and territorial===
[[Celia Green]] made a distinction between tribal and territorial morality.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Green, Celia (2004). ''Letters from Exile: Observations on a Culture in Decline''. Oxford: Oxford Forum. Chapters I–XX.&lt;/ref&gt; She characterizes the latter as predominantly negative and proscriptive: it defines a person's territory, including his or her property and dependents, which is not to be damaged or interfered with. Apart from these proscriptions, territorial morality is permissive, allowing the individual whatever behaviour does not interfere with the territory of another. By contrast, tribal morality is prescriptive, imposing the norms of the collective on the individual. These norms will be arbitrary, culturally dependent and 'flexible', whereas territorial morality aims at rules which are universal and absolute, such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s '[[categorical imperative]]' and [[Norman Geisler|Geisler]]'s [[graded absolutism]]. Green relates the development of territorial morality to the rise of the concept of private property, and the ascendancy of contract over status.

===In-group and out-group===
{{main|Ingroups and outgroups}}
Some observers hold that individuals apply distinct sets of moral rules to people depending on their membership of an "[[in-group]]" (the individual and those they believe to be of the same group) or an "out-group" (people not entitled to be treated according to the same rules). Some biologists, anthropologists and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] believe this in-group/out-group discrimination has evolved because it enhances group survival. This belief has been confirmed by simple computational models of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;T.R. Shultz, M. Hartshorn, and A. Kaznatcheev.

They conclude that certain virtues have prevailed in all cultures they examined. The major virtues they identified include ''wisdom / knowledge; courage; [[Humanity (virtue)|humanity]]; justice; temperance; and transcendence''. Each of these includes several divisions. For instance ''humanity'' includes ''[[love]]'', ''[[kindness]]'', and ''social intelligence''.

[[Fons Trompenaars]], author of ''Did the Pedestrian Die?'', tested members of different cultures with various [[moral dilemma]]s. One of these was whether the driver of a car would have his friend, a passenger riding in the car, lie in order to protect the driver from the consequences of driving too fast and hitting a pedestrian. Trompenaars found that different cultures had quite different expectations, from none to definite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BAYKAQAAMAAJ|title=Did the Pedestrian Die: Insights from the World's Greatest Culture Guru|last=Trompenaars|first=Fons|date=2003-03-14|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9781841124360|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
{{See also|Altruism#Evolutionary explanations|Evolution of morality|Evolutionary ethics}}

The development of modern morality is a process closely tied to [[sociocultural evolution]]. Some [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], particularly [[Sociobiology|sociobiologists]], believe that morality is a product of evolutionary forces acting at an individual level and also at the group level through [[group selection]] (although to what degree this actually occurs is a controversial topic in evolutionary theory). Some sociobiologists contend that the set of behaviors that constitute morality evolved largely because they provided possible survival or reproductive benefits (i.e. increased evolutionary success). Humans consequently evolved "pro-social" emotions, such as feelings of empathy or guilt, in response to these moral behaviors.

On this understanding, moralities are sets of self-perpetuating and biologically-driven behaviors which encourage human [[cooperation]]. Biologists contend that all social animals, from ants to elephants, have modified their behaviors, by restraining immediate [[selfishness]] in order to improve their evolutionary fitness. Human morality, although sophisticated and complex relative to the moralities of other animals, is essentially a natural phenomenon that evolved to restrict excessive individualism that could undermine a group's cohesion and thereby reducing the individuals' fitness.&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On this view, moral codes are ultimately founded on emotional instincts and intuitions that were selected for in the past because they aided survival and reproduction ([[inclusive fitness]]). Examples: the [[maternal bond]] is selected for because it improves the survival of offspring; the [[Westermarck effect]], where close proximity during early years reduces mutual sexual attraction, underpins [[Incest taboo|taboos against incest]] because it decreases the likelihood of genetically risky behaviour such as [[inbreeding]].

&lt;!-- kinship altruism theory --&gt;
&lt;!-- handicap altruism theory --&gt;
&lt;!-- reputation theory --&gt;
&lt;!-- reciprocity theory --&gt;
The phenomenon of [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]] in nature is seen by evolutionary biologists as one way to begin to understand human morality. Its function is typically to ensure a reliable supply of essential resources, especially for animals living in a habitat where food quantity or quality fluctuates unpredictably. For example, some [[vampire bat]]s fail to feed on prey some nights while others manage to consume a surplus. Bats that did eat will then regurgitate part of their blood meal to save a [[Conspecificity|conspecific]] from starvation. Since these animals live in close-knit groups over many years, an individual can count on other group members to return the favor on nights when it goes hungry (Wilkinson, 1984)

Marc Bekoff and Jessica Pierce (2009) have argued that morality is a suite of behavioral capacities likely shared by all mammals living in complex social groups (e.g., wolves, coyotes, elephants, dolphins, rats, chimpanzees). They define morality as "a suite of interrelated other-regarding behaviors that cultivate and regulate complex interactions within social groups." This suite of behaviors includes empathy, reciprocity, altruism, cooperation, and a sense of fairness.&lt;ref&gt;Bekoff, Marc and Jessica Pierce ''Wild Justice: The Moral Lives of Animals'' (Chicago, The University of Chicago Press 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In related work, it has been convincingly demonstrated that chimpanzees show [[empathy]] for each other in a wide variety of contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Connell |first= Sanjida |date=July 1995|title= Empathy in chimpanzees: Evidence for theory of mind? |journal= Primates|volume= 36|issue= 3|pages= 397–410|issn= 0032-8332 |url=  |quote=|doi= 10.1007/BF02382862 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also possess the ability to engage in deception, and a level of social politics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Good Natured: The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals|last = de Waal|first = Frans|date = 1997|publisher = Harvard University Press |isbn = 978-0674356610}}&lt;/ref&gt; prototypical of our own tendencies for [[gossip]] and [[reputation]] management.

Other theories are that increasing complexity was simply a correlate of increasing group size and brain size, and in particular the development of [[theory of mind]] abilities.

==Moral cognition==

Moral cognition refers to cognitive processes that allow a person to act or decide in morally permissible ways. It consists of several domain-general cognitive processes, ranging from perception of a morally-salient stimuli to reasoning when faced with a moral dilemma. While it’s important to mention that there is not a single cognitive faculty dedicated exclusively to moral cognition, characterizing the contributions of domain-general processes to moral behavior is a critical scientific endeavor to understand how morality works and how it can be improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Liane |last2=Dungan |first2=James |title=Where in the brain is morality? Everywhere and maybe nowhere |journal=Social Neuroscience |date=January 2012 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |doi=10.1080/17470919.2011.569146|pmid=21590587 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists investigate the inputs to these cognitive processes and their interactions, as well as how these contribute to moral behavior by running controlled experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yoder |first1=Keith J. |last2=Decety |first2=Jean |title=The neuroscience of morality and social decision-making |journal=Psychology, Crime &amp; Law |date=12 December 2017 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=279–295 |doi=10.1080/1068316X.2017.1414817}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these experiments putatively moral versus nonmoral stimuli are compared to each other, while controlling for other variables such as content or working memory load. Often, the differential neural response to specifically moral statements or scenes, are examined using functional neuroimaging experiments.

Critically, the specific cognitive processes that are involved depend on the prototypical situation that a person encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Monin |first1=Benoît |last2=Pizarro |first2=David A. |last3=Beer |first3=Jennifer S. |title=Deciding versus reacting: Conceptions of moral judgment and the reason-affect debate. |journal=Review of General Psychology |date=2007 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=99–111 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.11.2.99}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, while situations that require an active decision on a moral dilemma may require active reasoning, an immediate reaction to a shocking moral violation may involve quick, affect-laden processes. Nonetheless certain cognitive skills such as being able to attribute mental states—beliefs, intents, desires, emotions to oneself, and to others is a common feature of a broad range of prototypical situations. In line with this, a meta-analysis found overlapping activity between moral emotion and moral reasoning tasks, suggesting a shared neural network for both tasks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sevinc |first1=Gunes |last2=Spreng |first2=R. Nathan |title=Contextual and Perceptual Brain Processes Underlying Moral Cognition: A Quantitative Meta-Analysis of Moral Reasoning and Moral Emotions |journal=PLoS ONE |date=4 February 2014 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=e87427 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0087427|pmid=24503959 |bibcode=2014PLoSO...987427S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this meta-analaysis, however, also demonstrated that the processing of moral input is affected by task demands.

==Neuroscience==
{{anchor|Neuroscience of morality}}
{{see also|Science of morality}}
The brain areas that are consistently involved when humans reason about moral issues have been investigated by a quantitative large-scale meta-analysis of the brain activity changes reported in the moral neuroscience literature.,&lt;ref name = Bzdok&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/a8926q746t212727/ |title=Bzdok, D. et al.

This supports the notion that moral reasoning is related to both seeing things from other persons' points of view and to grasping others' feelings. These results provide evidence that the neural network underlying moral decisions is probably domain-global (i.e., there might be no such things as a "moral module" in the human brain) and might be dissociable into cognitive and affective sub-systems.&lt;ref name = Bzdok /&gt;

===Brain areas===

An essential, shared component of moral judgment involves the capacity to detect morally salient content within a given social context. Recent research implicated the salience network in this initial detection of moral content.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sevinc |first1=Gunes |last2=Gurvit |first2=Hakan |last3=Spreng |first3=R.

The explicit making of moral right and wrong judgments coincides with activation in the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] (VMPC) while intuitive reactions to situations containing implicit moral issues activates the [[temporoparietal junction]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harenski | first1 = CL | last2 = Antonenko | first2 = O | last3 = Shane | first3 = MS | last4 = Kiehl | first4 = KA.  | year = 2010 | title = A functional imaging investigation of moral deliberation and moral intuition | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 49 | issue = 3| pages = 2707–16 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.062 | pmid = 19878727 | pmc = 4270295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Stimulation of the VMPC by [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]], has been shown to inhibit the ability of human subjects to take into account intent when forming a moral judgment. According to this investigation, TMS did not disrupt participants' ability to make any moral
judgment. On the contrary, moral judgments of intentional harms and non-harms were unaffected by TMS to either the RTPJ or the control site; presumably, however, people typically make moral judgments of intentional harms by considering not only the action's harmful outcome but the agent's intentions and beliefs. So why
were moral judgments of intentional harms not affected by TMS to the RTPJ? One possibility is that moral judgments typically reflect a weighted function of any morally relevant information that is available at the time. On the basis of this view, when information concerning the agent's belief is unavailable or degraded, the resulting moral judgment simply reflects a higher weighting of other
morally relevant factors (e.g., outcome). Alternatively, following TMS to the RTPJ, moral judgments might be made via an abnormal processing route that does not take belief into account. On either account, when belief information is degraded or unavailable, moral judgments are shifted toward other morally relevant factors (e.g., outcome). For intentional harms and non-harms, however, the outcome suggests the same moral judgment as the intention. Thus, the researchers suggest that TMS to the RTPJ disrupted the processing of negative beliefs for both intentional harms and attempted harms, but the current design allowed the investigators to detect this effect only in the case of attempted harms, in which the neutral outcomes did not afford harsh moral judgments on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Young |first1= Liane |last2= Camprodon |first2= Joan Albert |last3= Hauser |first3= Marc |last4= Pascual-Leone |first4= Alvaro |last5= Saxe |first5= Rebecca |year= 2010 |title= Disruption of the right temporoparietal junction with transcranial magnetic stimulation reduces the role of beliefs in moral judgments |journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] |volume= 107 |issue= 15 |pages= 6753–58 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0914826107 |pmid=20351278 |pmc=2872442|bibcode= 2010PNAS..107.6753Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly VMPC-impaired persons will judge an action purely on its outcome and are unable to take into account the intent of that action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Young |first1= Liane |last2= Bechara |first2= Antoine |last3= Tranel |first3= Daniel |last4= Damasio |first4= Hanna |last5= Hauser |first5= Marc |last6= Damasio |first6= Antonio |year= 2010 |title= Damage to ventromedial prefrontal cortex impairs judgment of harmful intent |journal= Neuron |volume= 65 |issue= 6 |pages= 845–51 |doi= 10.1016/j.neuron.2010.03.003 |pmid=20346759 |pmc=3085837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mirror neurons===
{{main|Mirror neurons}}
Mirror neurons are neurons in the brain that fire when another person is observed doing a certain action.

[[File:Kohlberg Model of Moral Development.svg|thumb|[[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]] Model of Moral Development]]

In modern [[moral psychology]], morality is considered to change through personal development. A number of psychologists have produced theories on the development of morals, usually going through stages of different morals. [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], [[Jean Piaget]], and [[Elliot Turiel]] have cognitive-developmental approaches to [[moral development]]; to these theorists morality forms in a series of constructive stages or domains. In the [[Ethics of care]] approach established by [[Carol Gilligan]], moral development occurs in the context of caring, mutually responsive relationships  which are based on [[interdependence]], particularly in parenting but also in social relationships generally.&lt;ref&gt;Gilligan and Kohlberg: "Implications for Moral Theory" Author(s): Lawrence A. Blum
Source: ''Ethics'', Vol. 98, No. 3 (Apr., 1988), pp. 472–91&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social psychology|Social psychologists]] such as [[Martin Hoffman]] and [[Jonathan Haidt]] emphasize social and emotional development based on biology, such as [[empathy]]. Moral identity theorists, such as [[William Damon]] and [[Mordechai Nisan]], see moral commitment as arising from the development of a self-identity that is defined by moral purposes: this moral self-identity leads to a sense of responsibility to pursue such purposes. Of historical interest in psychology are the theories of [[psychoanalyst]]s such as [[Sigmund Freud]], who believe that moral development is the product of aspects of the [[super-ego]] as guilt-shame avoidance.

Because we are naturally prone to be empathic and moral, we have a sense of responsibility to pursue moral purposes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Decety | first = Jean | year = 2008 | title = Study shows Children are naturally prone to be empathic and moral | url = http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2008/07/11/children-are-naturally-prone-be-empathic-and-moral-university-chicago-study-shows | journal = University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Decety | first1 = J | last2 = Michalska | first2 = KJ | last3 = Akitsuki | first3 = Y | year = 2008 | title = Who caused the Pain?

Such behaviors jeopardize our moral self-image; however, when we engage in immoral behaviors we still feel as though we are moral individuals. ''[[Moral self-licensing]]'' attempts to explain this phenomenon and proposes that self-image security increases our likelihood to engage in immoral behavior. When our moral self-image is threatened, we can gain confidence from our past moral behavior. The more confident we are, the less we will worry about our future behavior which actually increases the likelihood that we will engage in immoral behaviors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Monin | first1 = B | last2 = Miller | first2 = D.

As an alternative to viewing morality as an individual trait, some sociologists as well as social- and discursive psychologists have taken upon themselves to study the ''in-vivo'' aspects of morality by examining how persons conduct themselves in social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bergmann Jörg |  year = 1998 | title = Introduction:Morality in discourse | url = | journal = Research on Language and Social Interaction | volume = 31 | issue = 3/4| pages = 279–74 | doi = 10.1080/08351813.1998.9683594 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Bergmann "Veiled morality: Notes on discretion in psychiatry."

==Politics==
If morality is the answer to the question 'how ought we to live' at the individual level, [[politics]] can be seen as addressing the same question at the social level, though the political sphere raises additional problems and challenges.&lt;ref&gt;See Weber, Eric Thomas. 2011. ''[http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/morality-leadership-and-public-policy-9781441144812/ Morality, Leadership, and Public Policy]'' (London: Continuum).&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore unsurprising that evidence has been found of a relationship between attitudes in morality and politics. [[Jonathan Haidt]] and [[Jesse Graham]] have studied the differences between [[Liberalism|liberals]] and [[conservatism|conservatives]], in this regard.&lt;ref name=haidt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/video/conference/2007/haidt |title=Morality: 2012: Online Only Video |publisher=The New Yorker |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousintersection.org/?p=1445 |title=Why conservatives and liberals talk past each other on moral issues. |publisher=Dangerous Intersection |date=2007-07-07 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haidt found that Americans who identified as liberals tended to value care and fairness higher than loyalty, respect and purity. Self-identified conservative Americans valued care and fairness less and the remaining three values more. Both groups gave care the highest over-all weighting, but conservatives valued fairness the lowest, whereas liberals valued purity the lowest. Haidt also hypothesizes that the origin of this division in the United States can be traced to geo-historical factors, with conservatism strongest in closely knit, ethnically homogenous communities, in contrast to [[port]]-cities, where the cultural mix is greater, thus requiring more liberalism.

Group morality develops from shared [[concept]]s and [[belief]]s and is often codified to regulate behavior within a [[culture]] or community. Various defined actions come to be called moral or immoral. Individuals who choose moral action are popularly held to possess "moral fiber", whereas those who indulge in immoral behavior may be labeled as socially degenerate. The continued existence of a group may depend on widespread conformity to codes of morality; an inability to adjust moral codes in response to new challenges is sometimes credited with the demise of a community (a positive example would be the function of [[Cistercian]] reform in reviving monasticism; a negative example would be the role of the [[Empress Dowager Cixi|Dowager Empress]] in the subjugation of China to European interests). Within [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movements, there has been some tendency to feel that a nation will not survive or prosper without acknowledging one common morality, regardless of its content.
Political Morality is also relevant to the behavior internationally of national governments, and to the support they receive from their host population. [[Noam Chomsky]] states that&lt;ref name="Zmag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/11934 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130113102044/http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/11934 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-13 |title=Terror and Just Response |publisher=ZNet |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |date=2002-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="counterpunch"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/schivone08032007.html &lt;!-- alternate: http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20070803.htm --&gt; |title=On Responsibility, War Guilt and Intellectuals |last=Schivone |first=Gabriel Matthew |date=2007-08-03 |journal=[[CounterPunch]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004204116/http://www.counterpunch.org/schivone08032007.html |archivedate=2009-10-04 |df= }} Interview.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... if we adopt the principle of universality : if an action is right (or wrong) for others, it is right (or wrong) for us. Those who do not rise to the minimal moral level of applying to themselves the standards they apply to others—more stringent ones, in fact—plainly cannot be taken seriously when they speak of appropriateness of response; or of right and wrong, good and evil.

In fact, one of the, maybe the most, elementary of moral principles is that of universality, that is, If something's right for me, it's right for you; if it's wrong for you, it's wrong for me. Any moral code that is even worth looking at has that at its core somehow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Religion==
{{Main|Ethics in religion|Morality and religion}} {{See also|Divine command theory|Divine law|Morality without religion|Religious law|Secular ethics}}

Religion and morality are not synonymous. Morality does not depend upon religion although for some this is "an almost automatic assumption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Rachels| first1 = (ed) James | last2 =  Rachels | first2 = (ed) Stuart | title = The Elements of Moral Philosophy | publisher = McGraw-Hill| edition = 7 | year = 2011| location = New York| page = | isbn = 0-078-03824-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'', religion and morality "are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other. Conceptually and in principle, morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Childress| first1 = (ed) James F. | last2 =  Macquarrie| first2 = (ed) John  | title = The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics | publisher = The Westminster Press| edition = | year = 1986| location = Philadelphia| page = 401| isbn = 0-664-20940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positions ===
Within the wide range of moral traditions, religious value systems co-exist with contemporary secular frameworks such as [[consequentialism]], [[freethought]], [[humanism]], [[utilitarianism]], and others. There are many types of religious value systems. Modern [[monotheistic]] religions, such as [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and to a certain degree others such as [[Sikhism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]], define right and wrong by the laws and rules set forth by their respective scriptures and as interpreted by religious leaders within the respective faith. Other religions spanning [[pantheistic]] to [[nontheistic]] tend to be less absolute. For example, within [[Buddhism]], the intention of the individual and the circumstances should be accounted for to determine if an action is right or wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Morgan, "Buddhism." In {{cite book |title= Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions |edition= Second|editor1-first=  Peggy|editor1-last= Morgan|editor2-first= Clive A. | editor2-last= Lawton|year= 2007|publisher= Columbia University Press|location= |isbn= 978-0-7486-2330-3 |pages= 61, 88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further disparity between the values of religious traditions is pointed out by [[Barbara Stoler Miller]], who states that, in Hinduism, "practically, right and wrong are decided according to the categories of social rank, kinship, and stages of life. For modern Westerners, who have been raised on ideals of universality and [[egalitarianism]], this relativity of values and obligations is the aspect of Hinduism most difficult to understand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Bhagavad Gita: Krishna's Counsel in Time of War |last=  Miller|first = Barbara Stoler|year = 2004|publisher= Random House|location= New York|isbn= 0-553-21365-2 |page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religions provide different ways of dealing with moral dilemmas. For example, there is no absolute prohibition on killing in [[Hinduism]], which recognizes that it "may be inevitable and indeed necessary" in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Menski, "Hinduism." In {{cite book |title= Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions |edition= Second|editor1-first=  Peggy|editor1-last= Morgan|editor2-first= Clive A. | editor2-last= Lawton|year= 2007|publisher= Columbia University Press|location= |isbn= 978-0-7486-2330-3 |page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In monotheistic traditions, certain acts are viewed in more absolute terms, such as [[abortion]] or [[divorce]].{{Ref label|A|a|none}} Religion is not always positively associated with morality. Philosopher [[David Hume]] stated that, "the greatest crimes have been found, in many instances, to be compatible with a superstitious [[piety]] and devotion; Hence it is justly regarded as unsafe to draw any inference in favor of a man's morals, from the fervor or strictness of his religious exercises, even though he himself believe them sincere."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hume]], "The Natural History of Religion." In {{cite book |title= The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Nonbeliever|last= Hitchens|first= Christopher|year= 2007|publisher= Da Capo Press|location= Philadelphia|isbn= 978-0-306-81608-6|page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious value systems can diverge from commonly-held contemporary moral positions, such as those on [[murder]], mass atrocities, and [[slavery]]. For example, [[Simon Blackburn]] states that "apologists for Hinduism defend or explain away its involvement with the caste system, and apologists for Islam defend or explain away its harsh penal code or its attitude to women and infidels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to Christianity, he states that the "[[Bible]] can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children, the mentally handicapped, animals, the environment, the divorced, unbelievers, people with various sexual habits, and elderly women",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and notes morally suspect themes in the Bible's [[New Testament]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|pages= 11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|E|e|none}} Christian [[apologists]] address Blackburn's viewpoints&lt;ref name="colley1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Colley|first=Caleb|title=Is Christianity a Threat to Ethics?|url=http://espanol.apologeticspress.org/articles/240427|publisher=Apologetics Press|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and construe that [[Halachah|Jewish laws]] in the [[Jewish Bible]] showed the evolution of moral standards towards protecting the vulnerable, imposing a death penalty on those pursuing slavery and treating slaves as persons and not property.&lt;ref name="enrichmentjournal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enrichmentjournal.ag.org/201102/201102_108_slavery.htm.cfm |title=Does the Old Testament Endorse Slavery?

These values can be resources for finding common ground between believers and nonbelievers.&lt;ref&gt;See Weber, Eric Thomas. "[http://www.ericthomasweber.org/Weber-RPRH.pdf Religion, Public Reason, and Humanism: Paul Kurtz on Fallibilism and Ethics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014235128/http://www.ericthomasweber.org/Weber-RPRH.pdf |date=2013-10-14 }}."

=== Empirical analyses ===
A number of studies have been conducted on the empirics of morality in various countries, and the overall relationship between faith and [[crime]] is unclear.{{Ref label|B|b|none}} A 2001 review of studies on this topic found "The existing evidence surrounding the effect of religion on crime is varied, contested, and inconclusive, and currently no persuasive answer exists as to the empirical relationship between religion and crime."&lt;ref name = baier/&gt; Phil Zuckerman's 2008 book, ''Society without God'', based on studies conducted during a 14-month period in Scandinavia in 2005-2006, notes that [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]], "which are probably the least religious countries in the world, and possibly in the history of the world", enjoy "among the lowest violent crime rates in the world [and] the lowest levels of corruption in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Society Without God: What the Least Religious Nations Can Tell Us about Contentment|edition= |last= Zuckerman|first= Phil|publisher= New York University Press|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-8147-9714-3|page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|C|c|none}}

Dozens of studies have been conducted on this topic since the twentieth century. A 2005 study by [[Gregory S. Paul]] published in the ''Journal of Religion and Society'' stated that, "In general, higher rates of belief in and worship of a creator correlate with higher rates of homicide, juvenile and early adult mortality, STD infection rates, teen pregnancy, and abortion in the prosperous democracies," and "In all secular developing democracies a centuries long-term trend has seen homicide rates drop to historical lows" with the exceptions being the United States (with a high religiosity level) and "theistic" Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/2005/2005-11.html |journal=Journal of Religion and Society|title=Cross-National Correlations of Quantifiable Societal Health with Popular Religiosity and Secularism in the Prosperous Democracies: A First Look|first=Gregory S.|last=Paul|location=Baltimore, Maryland|year =2005 |volume =7|pages=4–5, 8, 10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214113448/http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/2005/2005-11.html |archivedate=2011-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|D|d|none}}  In a response, Gary Jensen builds on and refines Paul's study.&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;Gary F. Jensen (2006) Department of Sociology, Vanderbilt University [http://moses.creighton.edu/jrs/2006/2006-7.pdf "Religious Cosmologies and Homicide Rates among Nations: A Closer Look'"],  ''Journal of Religion and Society'', Vol. 8, {{ISSN|1522-5658}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conclusion is that a "complex relationship" exists between religiosity and homicide "with some dimensions of religiosity encouraging homicide and other dimensions discouraging it". On April 26, 2012, the results of a study which tested their subjects' [[Prosocial behavior|pro-social]] sentiments were published in the ''[[Social Psychological and Personality Science]]'' journal in which non-religious people had higher scores showing that they were more inclined to show generosity in random acts of kindness, such as lending their possessions and offering a seat on a crowded bus or train. Religious people also had lower scores when it came to seeing how much compassion motivated participants to be charitable in other ways, such as in giving money or food to a homeless person and to non-believers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120430140035.htm "Highly Religious People Are Less Motivated by Compassion Than Are Non-Believers"].

The '''Mrdini''' are a [[fiction]]al [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[species]] from the [[The Rowan|Rowan]]/Talent series by [[Anne McCaffrey]]. They first appear in the novel [[Damia (novel)|Damia]].

The Mrdini, or 'Dinis, are described as looking somewhat like [[bipedalism|bipedal]] [[weasel]]s with one eye. They grow continuously throughout life, and size—along with the number of letters in their name—is an indicator of status in Mrdini culture. (For instance, a young 'Dini would have three letters in its name and be about the size of a child, whereas High Councillor Gktmglnt, co-president of the Human-Mrdini Alliance High Council, had more than twice the number of letters and was large enough to tower over most humans.)  They originate from a planet called Clarf, a world with very bright sunlight and a warmer average [[climate]] than [[Earth]]. The Mrdini, at the time of [[first contact (science fiction)|first contact]] with humans, had already [[colonisation|colonized]] several [[planetary system|star systems]] using slower-than-[[speed of light|light]] travel; when they finally met humans, they were given their own Prime Tower (in this series, some humans called Prime Talents, using [[Motor–generator|generator]]s in specialized facilities called Towers, have the ability to [[psychic]]ally [[Teleportation|teleport]] matter over interstellar distances).

The Mrdini culture has been shaped by generations of warfare with the rapacious colonizers called the Hivers. The only way they had to destroy the massive, heavily defended Hiver ships was to send in waves of [[kamikaze]] ships, in hopes that one would get through. This has led to a somewhat fatalistic warrior ethos, with death in battle seen as a way to win honor for one's "color" (clan).

The 'Dinis have some difficulty in [[communication|communicating]] with humans, an effort not made any easier by the fact that the Mrdini language consists entirely of [[consonant]]s; this problem is addressed by two methods in the series. The first is 'Dini Dreaming, a means of literally sharing images with others in their [[dream]]s. The telepathic Talents among humanity are particularly sensitive to these dream-messages, but they are limited to conveying only simple messages. The other, long-term answer to mutual misunderstanding is to have a number of human and 'Dini children [[language immersion|raised together]], to learn each other's ways and languages right from the start. The novel ''[[Damia's Children]]'' describes a family, the Raven-Lyons, who were one of the first to implement this program.

The Mrdini biology and [[reproductive system]] has significant differences from that of humans. They are seemingly [[gender]]less, or at least consider [[gender-specific pronoun|gender pronouns]] to be in bad taste. Once per year, they enter a mass [[hibernation]] for two months. When they come out of this state, there are young 'Dinis among them. It is not until late in the final book of the series, ''[[The Tower and the Hive]]'', that human scientists (and the readers) are allowed inside a Hibernatorium to discover how Mrdini reproduction works. Essentially, [[pheromones]] released during hibernation cause them to exchange [[gene|genetic material]] and even [[memories]], allowing their young to be born with some knowledge already in place. This unique quirk of their biology even allows individual Mrdini to be "[[cloning|recreated]]" if they die; just find the original parents, isolate them together during hibernation, and the same combination of genes and memories takes place. The "re-made" Mrdini will lack the recent life experience of the original, but will have essentially the same personality.

The fact that Mrdini reproduce with ''every'' hibernation, however, has posed tremendous problems for them in the past. Their starships, for instance, could not support an [[Human overpopulation|expanding population]]; so excess births had to go "on the line", a Mrdini euphemism for [[death]] or possibly even [[cannibalism]]. It was not until humans, with their system of [[teleportation]], appeared to them, that the Mrdini were able to give these unwanted children the chance to live.

Eventually, humans are able to work out a means of [[birth control|limiting Mrdini conception]] through manipulating their pheromones, allowing them to control their population growth for the first time in Mrdini history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29536">'''Mycoviruses''' (ancient Greek μύκης mykes: fungus and Latin [[virus]]) are [[viruses]] that infect [[fungi]]. Mycoviruses are also known as mycophage.The majority of mycoviruses have double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genomes and isometric particles, but approximately 30% have positive sense, single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) genomes.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pearson MN, Beever RE, Boine B, Arthur K | title = Mycoviruses of filamentous fungi and their relevance to plant pathology | journal = Molecular Plant Pathology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 115–28 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19161358 | doi = 10.1111/j.1364-3703.2008.00503.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boz"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bozarth RF | title = Mycoviruses: a new dimension in microbiology | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–39 | date = October 1972 | pmid = 4628853 | pmc = 1474899 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.720223 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To be a true '''mycovirus''', they must demonstrate an ability to be transmitted - in other words be able to infect other healthy fungi. Many double stranded RNA elements that have been described in fungi do not fit this description, and in these cases they are referred to as virus like particles or [[Virus-like particle|VLPs]]. Preliminary results indicate that most mycoviruses codiverge with their hosts, i.e. their [[phylogeny]] is largely congruent with the one of their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Göker M, Scheuner C, Klenk HP, Stielow JB, Menzel W | title = Codivergence of mycoviruses with their hosts | journal = PLOS One | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = e22252 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21829452 | pmc = 3146478 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0022252 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many virus families containing mycoviruses have only sparsely been sampled.

It is a special subdivision of the general field of [[virology]] and describes taxonomy, host range, origin and evolution, transmission and movement of mycoviruses and their impact on host phenotype.

==History==
The first record of an economic impact of mycoviruses on fungi was recorded in cultivated mushrooms (''[[Agaricus bisporus]]'') in the late 1940s and was called the La France disease.&lt;ref name="Hollings" &gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hollings M  | year=1962 |title=Viruses Associated with A Die-Back Disease of Cultivated Mushroom |journal=Nature |volume=196 |issue=4858 |pages=962–965 |doi=10.1038/196962a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollings found more than three different types of viruses in the abnormal [[sporophore]]s. This report marks the beginning of [[mycovirology]].&lt;ref name="Ghabrial" /&gt;

The La France Disease is also known as X disease, watery stripe, dieback and brown disease. [[Symptoms]] include:
* Reduced [[Crop yield|yield]]
* Slow and aberrant [[mycelial]] growth
* Waterlogging of tissue
* [[malformation]]
* Premature maturation
* Increased post-harvest deterioration (reduced shelf life)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Romaine CP, Schlagnhaufer B | title = PCR analysis of the viral complex associated with La France disease of Agaricus bisporus | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 61 | issue = 6 | pages = 2322–5 | date = June 1995 | pmid = 7793952 | pmc = 167503 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mushrooms have shown no resistance to the virus, and so control has had to be via [[hygienic]] practises to stop the spread of the virus.

However, the best known mycovirus is ''[[Cryphonectria parasitica]]'' hypovirus 1 (CHV1). CHV1 is exceptional amongst mycoviral research due its success as biocontrol agent against chestnut blight in Europe, but also because it is a model organism for studying hypovirulence in fungi. However, this system is only being used in Europe routinely, because of the relative small number of vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) on this continent. In contrast, in North America the distribution of the hypovirulent phenotype is often prevented because fungal hyphae cannot fuse and exchange their cytoplasmic content due to an incompatibility reaction. In the United States of America at least 35 VCGs were found.&lt;ref name=Anagnostakis &gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anagnostakis SL, Chen B, Geletka LM, Nuss DL | title = Hypovirus Transmission to Ascospore Progeny by Field-Released Transgenic Hypovirulent Strains of Cryphonectria parasitica | journal = Phytopathology | volume = 88 | issue = 7 | pages = 598–604 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 18944931 | doi = 10.1094/PHYTO.1998.88.7.598 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar situation seems to be present in China and Japan where 71 VCGs were identified so far.&lt;ref name=Liu&amp;Milgroom &gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu YC, Milgroom MG | title = High diversity of vegetative compatibility types in Cryphonectria parasitica in Japan and China | journal = Mycologia | volume = 99 | issue = 2 | pages = 279–84 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17682780 | doi = 10.3852/mycologia.99.2.279 | url = http://www.mycologia.org/content/99/2/279.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The majority of mycoviruses have double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genomes and isometric particles, but approximately 30% have positive sense, single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) genomes.&lt;ref name="Pearson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boz" /&gt; So far there is only one true example of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) mycovirus. A geminivirus-related virus was found in ''[[Sclerotinia sclerotiorum]]'' conferring hypovirulence to its host.&lt;ref name= "Yu"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu X, Li B, Fu Y, Jiang D, Ghabrial SA, Li G, Peng Y, Xie J, Cheng J, Huang J, Yi X | title = A geminivirus-related DNA mycovirus that confers hypovirulence to a plant pathogenic fungus | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 18 | pages = 8387–92 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20404139 | pmc = 2889581 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0913535107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The updated 9th ICTV report on virus taxonomy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ictvonline.org], King, A. M. Q., Lefkowitz E. M., Adams, J., Carstens, E. B. (2011). Virus Taxonomy: Ninth Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). San Diego, CA: Elsevier
Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; lists over 90 mycovirus species covering 10 viral families, of which 20% were unassigned to a genus or sometimes not even to a family. Isometric forms predominate mycoviral morphologies in comparison to rigid rods, flexuous rods, clubshaped
particles, enveloped bacilliform particles, and Herpesvirus-like viruses.&lt;ref name="Varga"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Varga J, Tóth B, Vágvölgyi C | title = Recent advances in mycovirus research | journal = Acta Microbiologica et Immunologica Hungarica | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 77–94 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12793203 | doi = 10.1556/AMicr.50.2003.1.8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of genomic data often hampers a conclusive assignment to already established groups of viruses or makes it impossible to erect new families and genera. The latter is true for many unencapsidated dsRNA viruses, which are assumed to be viral, but missing sequence data prevented their classification so far.&lt;ref name="Pearson" /&gt; So far, viruses of the families ''[[Partitiviridae]]'', ''[[Totiviridae]]'', and ''[[Narnaviridae]]'' are dominating the ‘mycovirus sphere’.

==Host range and incidence==
Mycoviruses are common in fungi (Herrero et al., 2009) and are found in all four phyla of the true fungi: ''Chytridiomycota'', ''Zygomycota'', ''[[Ascomycota]]'' and ''[[Basidiomycota]]''. Fungi are frequently infected with two or more unrelated viruses and also with defective dsRNA and/or satellite dsRNA.&lt;ref name="Ghabrial2"&gt;Ghabrial, S. A., Suzuki, N. (2008). Fungal Viruses.

W. (1986). Fungal Virology- An overview', in K. Buck (ed.), Fungal Virology (Boca Raton: CRC Press): 1-84.&lt;/ref&gt; but some mycoviruses can replicate in taxonomically different fungal hosts.&lt;ref name="Ghabrial" /&gt; Good examples are mitoviruses found in the two fungal species ''Sclerotinia homoeocarpa'' and ''Ophiostoma novo-ulmi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deng F, Xu R, Boland GJ | title = Hypovirulence-Associated Double-Stranded RNA from Sclerotinia homoeocarpa Is Conspecific with Ophiostoma novo-ulmi Mitovirus 3a-Ld | journal = Phytopathology | volume = 93 | issue = 11 | pages = 1407–14 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 18944069 | doi = 10.1094/PHYTO.2003.93.11.1407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuss et al. (2005) described that it is possible to extend the natural host range of ''[[Cryphonectria parasitica]]'' hypovirus 1 (CHV1) to several fungal species that are closely related to ''[[Cryphonectria parasitica]]'' using in vitro virus transfection techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen B, Choi GH, Nuss DL | title = Attenuation of fungal virulence by synthetic infectious hypovirus transcripts | journal = Science | volume = 264 | issue = 5166 | pages = 1762–4 | date = June 1994 | pmid = 8209256 | doi = 10.1126/science.8209256 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CHV1 can also propagate in the genera ''Endothia'' and ''Valsa'',&lt;ref name="Ghabrial2" /&gt; which belong to the two distinct families ''Cryphonectriaceae'' and ''Diaporthaceae'', respectively. Furthermore, some human pathogenic fungi are also found to be naturally infected with mycoviruses including AfuPmV-1 of ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kotta-Loizou I, Coutts RH | title = Aspergilli: A Comprehensive Review | language = English | journal = Frontiers in Microbiology | volume = 8 | pages = 1699 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28932216 | pmc = 5592211 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2017.01699 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and TmPV1 of ''[[Penicillium marneffei|Talaromyces marneffei]]'' &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lau SK, Lo GC, Chow FW, Fan RY, Cai JJ, Yuen KY, Woo PC | title = Novel Partitivirus Enhances Virulence of and Causes Aberrant Gene Expression in Talaromyces marneffei | journal = mBio  | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = e00947–18 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29895639 | pmc = 6016240 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.00947-18 | url = https://mbio.asm.org/content/9/3/e00947-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;''(formerly [[Penicillium marneffei]]).''

==Origin and evolution==
DsRNA as well as ssRNA are assumed to be very ancient and presumably originated from the ‘RNA world’ as both types of RNA viruses infect bacteria as well as eukaryotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Forterre P | title = The origin of viruses and their possible roles in major evolutionary transitions | journal = Virus Research | volume = 117 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–16 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16476498 | doi = 10.1016/j.virusres.2006.01.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the origin of viruses is still not well understood,&lt;ref name="Koonin"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Wolf YI | title = Genomics of bacteria and archaea: the emerging dynamic view of the prokaryotic world | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 36 | issue = 21 | pages = 6688–719 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18948295 | pmc = 2588523 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkn668 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recently presented data which suggest that viruses invaded the emerging ‘supergroups’ of eukaryotes from an ancestral pool in a very early stage of life on earth. According to Koonin,&lt;ref name="Koonin" /&gt; RNA viruses colonized eukaryotes first and subsequently co-evolved with their hosts. This concept fits well with the proposed ‘ancient co-evolution hypothesis’, which also assumes a long co-evolution of viruses and fungi.&lt;ref name="Pearson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Varga" /&gt; ‘The ancient coevolution hypothesis’ could contribute some explanation why mycoviruses are so diverse.&lt;ref name="Varga" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawe"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dawe AL, Nuss DL | title = Hypoviruses and chestnut blight: exploiting viruses to understand and modulate fungal pathogenesis | journal = Annual Review of Genetics | volume = 35 | issue =  | pages = 1–29 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11700275 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.35.102401.085929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that it is very likely that plant viruses containing a movement protein have evolved from mycoviruses by introducing of an extracellular phase into their life cycle, rather than eliminating it. Furthermore, the recent discovery of an ssDNA mycovirus tempted some researchers&lt;ref name="Yu" /&gt; to suggest that RNA and DNA viruses might have common evolutionary mechanisms. However, there are many cases where mycoviruses are grouped together with plant viruses. For example, CHV1 showed phylogenetic relatedness to the ssRNA genus Potyvirus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Fauquet CM, Mayo MA, Maniloff J | date = 2005 | title = Virus Taxonomy: Classification and Nomenclature of Viruses: The Eighth Report of the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses. | location = San Diego, CA | publisher = Elsevier Academic }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some ssRNA viruses, which were assumed to confer hypovirulence or debilitation, were often found to be more closely related to plant viruses than to other mycoviruses.&lt;ref name="Pearson" /&gt; Therefore, another theory arose that these viruses moved from a plant host to plant pathogenic fungal host or vice versa. This ‘plant virus hypothesis’ may not explain how mycoviruses developed originally, but it could help to understand how they evolved further.

==Transmission==
A significant difference between the genomes of mycoviruses to other viruses is the absence of genes for ‘cell-to-cell movement’ proteins. It is therefore assumed that mycoviruses only move intercellularly during cell division (e.g. sporogenesis) or via hyphal fusion.&lt;ref name="Ghabrial2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Ghabrial SA | date = 1994 | chapter = New Developments in Fungal Virology | veditors = Murphy FA, Maramorosch K, Aaron JS | title = Advances in Virus Research | volume = 43 | publisher = Academic Press | pages = 303–388 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mycoviruses might simply not need an external route of infection as they have many means of transmission and spread due to their fungal host’s life style:

* Plasmogamy and cytoplasmic exchange over extended periods of time
* Production of vast amounts of asexual spores
* Overwintering via sclerotia&lt;ref name="Liu_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu H, Fu Y, Jiang D, Li G, Xie J, Peng Y, Yi X, Ghabrial SA | title = A novel mycovirus that is related to the human pathogen hepatitis E virus and rubi-like viruses | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 1981–91 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19073734 | pmc = 2643757 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.01897-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* More or less effective transmission into sexual spores

However, there are potential barriers to mycovirus spread due to vegetative incompatibility and variable transmission to sexual spores. Transmission to sexually produced spores can range from 0% to 100% depending on the virus-host combination.&lt;ref name="Ghabrial2" /&gt; Transmission between species of the same genus sharing the same habitat has also been reported including ''Cryphonectria'' (''C. parasitica'' and ''C.'' sp), ''Sclerotinia'' (''[[Sclerotinia sclerotiorum]]'' and ''S. minor''), and ''Ophistoma'' (''O. ulmi'' and ''O. novo-ulmi'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu YC, Linder-Basso D, Hillman BI, Kaneko S, Milgroom MG | title = Evidence for interspecies transmission of viruses in natural populations of filamentous fungi in the genus Cryphonectria | journal = Molecular Ecology | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 1619–28 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12755889 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-294x.2003.01847.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Melzer MS, Deng F, Boland GJ | title = Asymptomatic infection, and distribution of ''Ophiostoma mitovirus'' 3a (OMV3a), in populations of ''Sclerotinia homoeocarpa'' | journal = Canadian Journal of Plant Pathology | date = December 2005 | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 610–5 | title-link = Sclerotinia homoeocarpa }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intraspecies transmission has also been reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Diepeningen AD, Debets AJ, Slakhorst SM, Fekete C, Hornok L, Hoekstra RF | date = 2000 | title = Interspecies virus transfer via protoplast fusions between ''Fusarium poae'' and black ''Aspergillus'' strains. | journal = Fungal Genetics Newsletter | volume = 47 | pages = 99–100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; between ''Fusarium poae'' and black ''[[Aspergillus]]'' isolates. However, it is not known how fungi overcome the genetic barrier; whether there is some form of recognition process during physical contact or some other means of exchange, such as vectors. Research&lt;ref name="Diep"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Diepeningen AD, Debets AJ, Hoekstra RF | title = Dynamics of dsRNA mycoviruses in black Aspergillus populations | journal = Fungal Genetics and Biology : FG &amp; B | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 446–52 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16546419 | doi = 10.1016/j.fgb.2006.01.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using ''[[Aspergillus]]'' species indicated that transmission efficiencies might depend on the hosts viral infection status (infected with no, different, or same virus), and that mycoviruses might play a role in the regulation of secondary mycoviral infection. Whether this is also true for other fungi is not yet known. In contrast to acquiring mycoviruses spontaneously, the loss of mycoviruses seems very infrequent&lt;ref name="Diep" /&gt; and suggests that either viruses actively moved into spores and new hyphal tips, or the fungus might facilitate the mycoviral transport in some other way.

==Movement of mycoviruses within fungi==
Although it is not known yet whether viral transport is an active or passive process, it is generally assumed that fungal viruses move forward by plasma streaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sasaki A, Kanematsu S, Onoue M, Oyama Y, Yoshida K | title = Infection of Rosellinia necatrix with purified viral particles of a member of Partitiviridae (RnPV1-W8) | journal = Archives of Virology | volume = 151 | issue = 4 | pages = 697–707 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16307176 | doi = 10.1007/s00705-005-0662-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically they could drift with the cytoplasm as it extends into new hyphae, or attach to the web of microtubuli, which would drag them through the internal cytoplasmic space. That might explain how they pass through septa and bypass woronin bodies. However, some researchers have found them located next to septum walls,&lt;ref name="Boz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vilches S, Castillo A | title = A double-stranded RNA mycovirus in Botrytis cinerea | journal = FEMS Microbiology Letters | volume = 155 | issue = 1 | pages = 125–30 | date = October 1997 | pmid = 9345772 | doi = 10.1016/S0378-1097(97)00377-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which could imply that they ‘got stuck’ and were not able to move actively forward themselves. Others have suggested that the transmission of viral mitochondrial dsRNA may play an important role in the movement of mitoviruses found in ''[[Botrytis cinerea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu M, Zhang L, Li G, Jiang D, Ghabrial SA | title = Genome characterization of a debilitation-associated mitovirus infecting the phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea | journal = Virology | volume = 406 | issue = 1 | pages = 117–26 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20674953 | doi = 10.1016/j.virol.2010.07.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on host phenotype==
Phenotypic effects of mycoviral infections can vary from advantageous to deleterious, but most of them are asymptomatic or cryptic. The connection between phenotype and mycovirus presence is not always straight forward. Several reasons may account for this. First, the lack of appropriate infectivity assays often hindered the researcher from reaching a coherent conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCabe PM, Pfeiffer P, Van Alfen NK | title = The influence of dsRNA viruses on the biology of plant pathogenic fungi | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 7 | issue = 9 | pages = 377–81 | date = September 1999 | pmid = 10470047 | doi = 10.1016/S0966-842X(99)01568-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, mixed infection or unknown numbers of infecting viruses make it very difficult to associate a particular phenotypic change with the investigated virus.

Although most mycoviruses often do not seem to disturb their host’s fitness, this does not necessarily mean they are living unrecognized by their hosts. A neutral co-existence might just be the result of a long co-evolutionary process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = May RM, Nowak MA | title = Coinfection and the evolution of parasite virulence | journal = Proceedings. Biological Sciences | volume = 261 | issue = 1361 | pages = 209–15 | date = August 1995 | pmid = 7568274 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.1995.0138 | url = http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~ped/people/faculty/publications_nowak/ProcRoySoc95b.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Araújo, A., Jansen, A. M., Bouchet, F., Reinhard, K., Ferreira, L. F. (2003). Parasitism, the Diversity of Life, and Paleoparasitology. Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, 98 (SUPPL. 1): 5-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, symptoms may only appear when certain conditions of the virus-fungus-system change and get out of balance. This could be external (environmental) as well as internal (cytoplasmic). It is not known yet why some mycoviruses-fungus-combinations are typically detrimental while others are asymptomatic or even beneficial. Nevertheless, harmful effects of mycoviruses are economically interesting, especially if the fungal host is a phytopathogen and the mycovirus could be exploited as biocontrol agent. The best example is represented by the case of CHV1 and ''C. parasitica''.&lt;ref name="Ghabrial2" /&gt; Other examples of deleterious effects of mycoviruses are the ‘La France’ disease of ''Agaricus biporus''&lt;ref name="Hollings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ro"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ro HS, Lee NJ, Lee CW, Lee HS | title = Isolation of a novel mycovirus OMIV in Pleurotus ostreatus and its detection using a triple antibody sandwich-ELISA | journal = Journal of Virological Methods | volume = 138 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 24–9 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 16930731 | doi = 10.1016/j.jviromet.2006.07.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mushroom diseases caused by Oyster mushroom spherical virus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu HJ, Lim D, Lee HS | title = Characterization of a novel single-stranded RNA mycovirus in Pleurotus ostreatus | journal = Virology | volume = 314 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–15 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 14517055 | doi = 10.1016/S0042-6822(03)00382-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oyster mushroom isometric virus.&lt;ref name="Ro" /&gt;

In summary, the main negative effects of mycoviruses are:
* Decreased growth rate&lt;ref name="Mol"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moleleki N, van Heerden SW, Wingfield MJ, Wingfield BD, Preisig O | title = Transfection of Diaporthe perjuncta with Diaporthe RNA virus | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 69 | issue = 7 | pages = 3952–6 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12839766 | pmc = 165159 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.69.7.3952-3956.2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lack of sporulation&lt;ref name="Mol" /&gt;

* Reduced germination of basidiospores&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ihrmark K, Stenström E, Stenlid J | title = Double-stranded RNA transmission through basidiospores of Heterobasidion annosum | journal = Mycological Research | volume = 108 | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 149–53 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 15119351 | doi = 10.1017/S0953756203008839 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypovirulent phenotypes do not appear to correlate with specific genome features and it seems there is not one particular metabolic pathway causing hypovirulence but several.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xie J, Wei D, Jiang D, Fu Y, Li G, Ghabrial S, Peng Y | title = Characterization of debilitation-associated mycovirus infecting the plant-pathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum | journal = The Journal of General Virology | volume = 87 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 241–9 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16361437 | doi = 10.1099/vir.0.81522-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to negative effects, beneficial interactions do also occur. Well described examples are the killer phenotypes in yeasts&lt;ref name="Schmitt"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmitt MJ, Breinig F | title = The viral killer system in yeast: from molecular biology to application | journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 257–76 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12165427 | doi = 10.1016/S0168-6445(02)00099-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Ustilago''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marquina D, Santos A, Peinado JM | title = Biology of killer yeasts | journal = International Microbiology | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 65–71 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12180782 | doi = 10.1007/s10123-002-0066-z | url = http://www.im.microbios.org/articles0203/2002/june/03%20Marquina.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Killer isolates secrete proteins that are toxic to sensitive cells of the same or closely related species while the producing cells themselves are immune. Most of these toxins degrade the cell membrane.&lt;ref name="Schmitt" /&gt; There are potentially interesting applications of killer isolates in medicine, food industry, and agriculture.&lt;ref name="Dawe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmitt" /&gt; A three-part system involving a mycovirus of an endophytic fungus (''Curvularia protuberata'') of the grass ''Dichanthelium lanuginosum'' has been described, which provides a thermal tolerance to the plant, enabling it to inhabit adverse environmental niches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Márquez LM, Redman RS, Rodriguez RJ, Roossinck MJ | title = A virus in a fungus in a plant: three-way symbiosis required for thermal tolerance | journal = Science | volume = 315 | issue = 5811 | pages = 513–5 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17255511 | doi = 10.1126/science.1136237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In medically important fungi, an uncharacterized A78 virus of ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus|Aspergillus fugmigatus]]'' causes mild hypervirulent effect on pathogenicity when tested on ''Galleria mellonella'' (Greater wax moth).&lt;ref name="linkinghub.elsevier.com"/&gt; Furthermore, TmPV1, a dsRNA partitivirus, of ''[[Penicillium marneffei|Talaromyces marneffei]] (formerly [[Penicillium marneffei]])'' was found to cause hyperviruelnece phenotype on [[Penicillium marneffei|''Talaromyces marneffei'']] when tested on a mouse model.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These could imply mycoviruses may play important roles in the pathogensis of human pathogenic fungi.

'''Not Dead Yet''' (NDY) is a [[United States]] [[disability rights]] group that opposes [[assisted suicide]] and [[euthanasia]] for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/1999-09-23/news/25487953_1_suicide-and-euthanasia-disability-rights-group-disabled-people |first=William R. |last=Macklin |title=Tiny Disability-rights Group Scores At Princeton Not Dead Yet, Built On Opposition To Assisted Suicide And Euthanasia, Gained Notice Protesting Against A Bioethicist. - Philly.com |publisher=Articles.philly.com |date=2001-04-20 |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diane Coleman, JD, is the founder and president of this national group. Stephen Drake, a research analyst with NDY, is one of the group's chief spokespersons and contacts for press releases.

The group was founded on April 27, 1996. Its name comes from the film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', in which [[bubonic plague|plague]] victims are thrown into a cart and hauled off to be buried.  A man being given up as a corpse by his family protests that he is "not dead yet!"

In 2004 NDY protested the removal of [[Terri Schiavo]]'s feeding tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A19752-2005Apr1.html |title=Schiavo Raised Profile of Disabled |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raggededgemagazine.com/focus/postschiavo0405.html |title=After Terri Schiavo |publisher=Raggededgemagazine.com |date=2005-04-02 |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also protested the movie ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'', in which the injection of an overdose of [[epinephrine]] to euthanize a suicidal [[quadriplegic]] woman is depicted as a rational and compassionate act. The group has been highly critical of utilitarian philosophers such as [[Peter Singer]] of [[Princeton University]].  Coleman has called Professor Singer "the most dangerous man on earth" and asserted that he was advocating genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Johann |last=Hari |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/peter-singer-some-people-are-more-equal-than-others-6166342.html |title=Peter Singer: Some people are more equal than others - Profiles - People |publisher=The Independent |date=2004-07-01 |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015 NDY organized protests against Singer's position that new-born babies with certain disabilities can morally be killed, which he sees as no different from abortion. The protesters called for Princeton University to dismiss Singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/16/peter-singer-princeton-bioethics-professor-faces-c/ |first=Jessica |last=Chasmar |title=Peter Singer, Princeton bioethics professor, faces calls for resignation over infanticide support |publisher=Washington Times |date=2015-06-16 |accessdate=2015-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Onychophora''' (from [[Ancient Greek]], ''onyches'', "claws"; and ''pherein'', "to carry"), commonly known as '''velvet worms''' (due to their velvety texture and somewhat wormlike appearance) or more ambiguously as '''peripatus''' (after the first described genus, ''[[Peripatus]]''), is a [[phylum]] of elongate, soft-bodied, many-legged [[panarthropod]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |last1=Holm |first1=E. |last2=Dippenaar-Schoeman |first2=A. |title=The Arthropods of Southern Africa |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-7993-4689-3}}{{page needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prothero"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Prothero |first1=D.

Approximately 200 species of velvet worms have been described, although the true number of species is likely greater. The two extant families of velvet worms are [[Peripatidae]] and [[Peripatopsidae]]. They show a peculiar distribution, with the peripatids being predominantly equatorial and tropical, while the peripatopsids are all found south of the equator. It is the only phylum within [[animalia]] that is wholly endemic to terrestrial environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Ross Piper |last=Piper |first=Ross |year=2007 |chapter=Velvet Worms |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=eqegRf2UstIC&amp;pg=PA109 |pages=109–11 |title=Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0-313-33922-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Velvet worms are considered close relatives of the [[Arthropoda]] and [[Tardigrada]], with which they form the [[taxon]] Panarthropoda.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |last=Fishelson |first=L. |title=Zoology |edition=3rd |year=1978 |publisher=Hakibutz Hameuchad Publishing |location=Israel |volume=1 |page=430 }}{{vs|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes them of palaeontological interest, as they can help reconstruct the ancestral arthropod. In modern [[zoology]], they are particularly renowned for their curious [[mating]] behaviour and for [[viviparity|bearing live young]].

==Anatomy==
Velvet worms are [[segmentation (biology)|segmented]] animals with a flattened [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] body cross-section and rows of unstructured body [[appendage]]s known as oncopods or lobopods (informally: stub feet). The animals grow to between 0.5 and 20&amp;nbsp;cm (.2 to 8&amp;nbsp;in), with the average being about 5&amp;nbsp;cm (2 &amp;nbsp;in), and have between 13 and 43 pairs of legs. Their [[skin]] consists of numerous, fine transverse rings and is often inconspicuously coloured orange, red or brown, but sometimes also bright green, blue, gold or white, and occasionally patterned with other colours. Segmentation is outwardly inconspicuous, and identifiable by the regular spacing of the pairs of legs and in the regular arrangement of skin [[wiktionary:pore|pore]]s, [[excretion]] organs and concentrations of [[nerve cell]]s. The individual body sections are largely [[specialization (biology)|unspecialised]]; even the head develops only a little differently from the [[abdomen|abdominal]] segments. Segmentation is apparently specified by the same [[gene]] as in other groups of animals, and is activated in each case, during [[embryo|embryonic development]], at the rear border of each segment and in the growth zone of the stub feet. Although onychophorans fall within the [[protostome]] group, their early development has a [[deuterostome]] trajectory, (with the mouth and anus forming separately); this trajectory is concealed by the rather sophisticated processes which occur in early development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2014.2628| title = Fate and nature of the onychophoran mouth-anus furrow and its contribution to the blastopore| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences| volume = 282| issue = 1805| pages = 20142628| date = 18 March 2015| last1 = Janssen | first1 = R.| last2 = Jorgensen | first2 = M.| last3 = Lagebro | first3 = L.| last4 = Budd | first4 = G. E. | pmid=25788603 | pmc=4389607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appendages===
The stub feet that characterise the velvet worms are [[cone (geometry)|conical]], baggy appendages of the body, which are internally hollow and have no joints. Although the number of feet can vary considerably between species, their structure is basically very similar. Rigidity is provided by the [[hydrostatic]] pressure of their [[fluid]] contents, and movement is usually obtained passively by stretching and contraction of the animal's entire body. However, each leg can also be shortened and bent by internal [[muscle]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Due to the lack of joints, this bending can take place at any point along the sides of the leg. In some species, two different organs are found within the feet:

*Crural glands are situated at the shoulder of the legs, extending into the body cavity. They open outwards at the crural papillae—small wart-like bumps on the belly side of the leg—and secrete chemical messenger materials called [[pheromone]]s. Their name comes from the [[Latin]] ''cruralis'' meaning "of the legs".
*Coxal vesicles are pouches located on the belly side of the leg, which can be everted and probably serve in water absorption. They are only found within the family Peripatidae and are named from ''coxa'', the Latin word for "hip".

[[File:Euperipatoides claw pair.tif|thumb|right|A pair of claws from ''[[Euperipatoides kanangrensis]]'']]
On each foot is a pair of retractable, hardened (sclerotised) [[chitin]] claws, which give the taxon its scientific name: Onychophora is derived from the Greek ''onyches'', "claws"; and ''pherein'', "to carry". At the base of the claws are three to six spiny "cushions" on which the leg sits in its resting position and on which the animal walks over smooth substrates. The claws are used mainly to gain a firm foothold on uneven terrain. Each claw is composed of three stacked elements, like Russian nesting dolls. The outermost is shed during ecdysis, which exposes the next element in — which is fully formed, so does not need time to harden before it is used.&lt;ref name="doi10.1038/nature13576"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Martin R. |last1=Smith |first2=Javier |last2=Ortega-Hernández |date=October 2014 |title=''Hallucigenia''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s onychophoran-like claws and the case for Tactopoda |journal=Nature |volume=514 |issue=7522 |pages=363–6 |pmid=25132546 |doi=10.1038/nature13576|bibcode=2014Natur.514..363S |url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/19108/1/19108.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; (This distinctive construction identifies many early Cambrian fossils as early offshoots of the onychophoran lineage.&lt;ref name="doi10.1038/nature13576" /&gt;) Apart from the pairs of legs, there are three further body appendages, which are at the head and comprise three segments:

* On the first head segment is a pair of slender [[antenna (biology)|antennae]], which serve in [[sensory perception]]. They probably do not correspond directly to the antennae of the Arthropoda,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Bo Joakim |last1=Eriksson |first2=Noel N. |last2=Tait |first3=Graham E. |last3=Budd |first4=Ralf |last4=Janssen |first5=Michael |last5=Akam |date=September 2010 |title=Head patterning and Hox gene expression in an onychophoran and its implications for the arthropod head problem |journal=Development Genes and Evolution |volume=220 |issue=3–4 |pages=117–22 |pmid=20567844 |doi=10.1007/s00427-010-0329-1|url=http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:374350/FULLTEXT01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but perhaps rather with their "lips" or [[labrum (arthropod mouthpart)|labrum]]. At their base is found a pair of [[simple eye in invertebrates|simple eyes]], except in a few [[blindness|blind]] species. In front of these, in many [[Australia|Australian]] species, are various dimples, the function of which is not yet clear. It appears that in at least some species, these serve in the transfer of sperm-cell packages ([[spermatophore]]s).
* On the belly side of the second head segment is the labrum, a mouth opening surrounded by sensitive "lips". In the velvet worms, this structure is a muscular outgrowth of the [[throat]], so, despite its name, it is probably not [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the labrum of the Arthropoda and is used for feeding. Deep within the oral cavity lie the sharp, crescent-shaped "jaws", or [[mandible (arthropod mouthpart)|mandibles]], which are strongly hardened and resemble the claws of the feet, with which they are serially homologous;&lt;ref name=Mayer2015/&gt; early in development, the jaw appendages have a similar position and shape to the subsequent legs.&lt;ref name="Eriksson2003"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=B. Joakim |last1=Eriksson |first2=Noel N. |last2=Tait |first3=Graham E. |last3=Budd |date=January 2003 |title=Head development in the onychophoran ''Euperipatoides kanangrensis'' with particular reference to the central nervous system |journal=Journal of Morphology |volume=255 |issue=1 |pages=1–23 |pmid=12420318 |doi=10.1002/jmor.10034}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jaws are divided into internal and external mandibles and their concave surface bears fine denticles. They move backward and forward in a longitudinal direction, tearing apart the prey, apparently moved in one direction by musculature and the other by hydrostatic pressure.&lt;ref name=Mayer2015/&gt;  The claws are made of sclerotised α-chitin, reinforced with phenols and chinons, and have a uniform composition – except that there is a higher concentration of calcium towards the tip, presumably affording greater strength.&lt;ref name=Mayer2015/&gt;

The surface of the mandibles is smooth, with no ornamentation.&lt;ref name="Wright1989"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jonathan C. |last1=Wright |first2=Barbara M. |last2=Luke |title=Ultrastructural and histochemical investigations of ''peripatus'' integument |journal=Tissue &amp; Cell |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=605–25 |year=1989 |pmid=18620280 |doi=10.1016/0040-8166(89)90012-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cuticle in the mandibles (and claws) is distinct from the rest of the body. It has an inner and outer component; the outer component has just two layers (whereas body cuticle has four), and these outer layers (in particular the inner epicuticle) are dehydrated and strongly tanned, affording toughness.&lt;ref name="Wright1989" /&gt;

===Slime glands===
On the third head segment, to the left and right of the mouth, are two openings designated "oral papillae". Within these are a pair of large, heavily internally branched slime glands. These lie roughly in the centre of the body and secrete a sort of milky-white slime, which is used to ensnare [[prey]] and for defensive purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morera-Brenes|first1=B.|last2=Monge-Najera|first2=J.|title=A new giant species of placented worm and the mechanism by which onychophorans weave their nets (onychophora: Peripatidae)|journal=Revista Biolologia Tropical|date=2010|volume=58|pages=1127–1142|url=http://www.kerwa.ucr.ac.cr/handle/10669/4483|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402132847/http://www.kerwa.ucr.ac.cr/handle/10669/4483|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the connecting "slime conductor" is broadened into a reservoir, which can buffer pre-produced slime. The slime glands themselves are probably modified crural glands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Concha|first1=Andrés|last2=Mellado|first2=Paula|last3=Morera-Brenes|first3=B.|last4=Sampaio Costa|first4=Cristiano|last5=Mahadevan|first5=L.|last6=Monge-Nájera|first6=Julián|title=Oscillation of the velvet worm slime jet by passive hydrodynamic instability|journal=Nature Communications|date=17 March 2015|volume=6|pages=6292|doi=10.1038/ncomms7292|pmid=25780995|pmc=4382676|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150317/ncomms7292/full/ncomms7292.html|bibcode=2015NatCo...6E6292C}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three structures correspond to an [[evolution]]ary origin in the leg pairs of the other segments.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Skin and muscle===
Unlike the arthropods, velvet worms do not possess a rigid [[exoskeleton]]. Instead, their fluid-filled body cavity acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, similarly to many unrelated soft-bodied animals that are cylindrically shaped, for example [[sea anemones]] and various [[worm]]s. Pressure of their [[incompressible]] internal bodily fluid on the body wall provides rigidity, and muscles are able to act against it. The body wall consists of a non-cellular outer skin, the [[cuticula]]; a single layer of [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] cells forming an internal skin; and beneath this, usually three layers of muscle, which are embedded in connective tissues. The cuticula is about a [[micrometre|micrometer]] thick and covered with fine [[wiktionary:Villi|villi]]. In composition and structure, it resembles the cuticula of the arthropods, consisting of α&lt;!--not 'a'--&gt;-chitin and various [[protein]]s,&lt;ref name=Mayer2015/&gt; although not containing [[collagen]]. It can be divided into an external epicuticula and an internal procuticula, which themselves consist of exo- and endo-cuticula. This multi-level structure is responsible for the high flexibility of the outer skin, which enables the velvet worm to squeeze itself into the narrowest crevices. Although outwardly [[water-repellent]], the cuticula is not able to prevent water loss by [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]], and, as a result, velvet worms can only live in [[microclimate]]s with high [[humidity]] to avoid [[desiccation]]. The surface of the cuticula is scattered with numerous fine papillae, the larger of which carry visible villi-like sensitive bristles. The papillae themselves are covered with tiny [[scale (zoology)|scale]]s, lending the skin a [[velvet]]y appearance (from which the common name is likely derived). It also feels like dry velvet to the touch, for which its water-repellent nature is responsible. Moulting of the skin ([[ecdysis]]) takes place regularly, around every 14 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Sylvia |last1=Campiglia |first2=Roger |last2=Lavallard |year=1990 |chapter=On the ecdysis at birth and intermoult period of gravid and young ''Peripatus acacioi'' (Onycophora, Peripatidae) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=BJzFnCunVxsC&amp;pg=PA461 |pages=461–4 |editor1-first=Alessandro |editor1-last=Minelli |title=Proceedings of the 7th International Congress of Myriapodology |isbn=978-90-04-08972-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; induced by the [[hormone]] [[ecdysone]]. The inner surface of the skin bears a hexagonal pattern.&lt;ref name="Maas2007"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Andreas |last1=Maas |first2=Georg |last2=Mayer |first3=Reinhardt M. |last3=Kristensen |first4=Dieter |last4=Waloszek |date=December 2007 |title=A Cambrian micro-lobopodian and the evolution of arthropod locomotion and reproduction |journal=Chinese Science Bulletin |volume=52 |issue=24 |pages=3385–92 |doi=10.1007/s11434-007-0515-3|bibcode=2007ChSBu..52.3385M }}&lt;/ref&gt; At each moult, the shed skin is replaced by the epidermis, which lies immediately beneath it; unlike the cuticula, this consists of living cells. Beneath this lies a thick layer of connective tissue, which is composed primarily of collagen fibres aligned either [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] or [[perpendicular]] to the body's longitudinal axis. The colouration of Onychophora is generated by a range of pigments.{{Clarify|date=May 2009}} The solubility of these pigments is a useful diagnostic character: in all arthropods and tardigrades, the body pigment is soluble in ethanol. This is also true for the Peripatidae, but in the case of the Peripatopsidae, the body pigment is insoluble in ethanol.&lt;ref name=Monge1995&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Julian |last1=Monge-Najera |date=May 1995 |title=Phylogeny, biogeography and reproductive trends in the Onychophora |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=21–60 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1995.tb00111.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the connective tissue lie three continuous layers of unspecialised [[smooth muscle|smooth muscular]] tissue. The relatively thick outer layer is composed of annular muscles, and the similarly voluminous inner layer of longitudinal muscles. Between them lie thin diagonal muscles that wind backward and forward along the body axis in a [[spiral]]. Between the annular and diagonal muscles exist fine [[blood vessel]]s, which lie below the superficially recognisable transverse rings of the skin and are responsible for the pseudo-segmented markings.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Beneath the internal muscle layer lies the body cavity. In cross-section, this is divided into three regions by so-called dorso-ventral muscles, which run from the middle of the underbelly through to the edges of the upper side: a central midsection and on the left and right, two side regions that also include the legs.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Circulation===
The body cavity is known as a "pseudocoel", or [[haemocoel]]. Unlike a true [[coelom]], a pseudocoel is not fully enclosed by a cell layer derived from the embryonic [[mesoderm]]. A coelom is, however, formed around the [[gonad]]s and the waste-eliminating [[nephridia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} As the name ''haemocoel'' suggests, the body cavity is filled with a [[blood]]-like liquid in which all the organs are embedded; in this way, they can be easily supplied with [[nutrient]]s circulating in the blood. This liquid is colourless as it does not contain [[pigment]]s; for this reason, it only serves a limited role in [[oxygen]] transport. Two different types of blood cells (or haemocytes) circulate in the fluid: [[amoebocyte]]s and nephrocytes. The amoebocytes probably function in protection from [[bacteria]] and other foreign bodies; in some species, they also play a role in [[reproduction]]. Nephrocytes absorb [[toxin]]s or convert them into a form suitable for [[clearance (medicine)|elimination]] by the nephridia.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The haemocoel is divided by a horizontal partition, the diaphragm,&lt;!--Do '''''not''''' link this to any article referring to any kind of Chordate diaphragm, in particular not the thoracic diaphragm. They have nothing to do with each other.--&gt; into two parts: the [[pericardial sinus]] along the back and the perivisceral sinus along the belly. The former encloses the tube-like heart, and the latter, the other organs. The diaphragm is perforated in many places, enabling the exchange of fluids between the two cavities.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The heart itself is a tube of annular muscles consisting of [[epithelium|epithelial]] tissues, with two lateral openings ([[wikt:ostium|ostia]]) per segment. While it is not known whether the rear end is open or closed, from the front, it opens directly into the body cavity. Since there are no blood vessels, apart from the fine vessels running between the muscle layers of the body wall and a pair of arteries that supply the antennae, this is referred to as an [[open circulation]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The timing of the pumping procedure can be divided into two parts: [[diastole]] and [[systole (medicine)|systole]]. During diastole, blood flows through the ostia from the pericardial sinus (the cavity containing the heart) into the heart. When the systole begins, the ostia close and the heart muscles contract inwards, reducing the volume of the heart. This pumps the blood from the front end of the heart into the perivisceral sinus containing the organs. In this way, the various organs are supplied with nutrients before the blood finally returns to the pericardial sinus via the perforations in the diaphragm. In addition to the pumping action of the heart, body movements also have an influence on circulation.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Respiration===
Oxygen uptake occurs to an extent via simple [[diffusion]] through the entire body surface, with the coxal vesicles on the legs possibly being involved in some species. However, of most importance is gas exchange via fine unbranched tubes, the [[invertebrate trachea|trachea]]e, which draw oxygen from the surface deep into the various organs, particularly the heart. The walls of these structures, which are less than three micrometers thick in their entirety, consist only of an extremely thin [[biological membrane|membrane]] through which oxygen can easily diffuse. The tracheae originate at tiny openings, the [[spiracle]]s, which themselves are clustered together in dent-like recesses of the outer skin, the [[wikt:atrium|atria]]. The number of "tracheae bundles" thus formed is on average around 75 per body segment; they accumulate most densely on the back of the organism.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Unlike the arthropods, the velvet worms are unable to control the openings of their tracheae; the tracheae are always open, entailing considerable water loss in [[arid]] conditions. Water is lost twice as fast as in earthworms and forty times faster than in caterpillars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=S. M. |last1=Manton |date=June 20, 1949 |title=Studies on the Onychophora. VII. The Early Embryonic Stages of ''Peripatopsis'', and Some General Considerations Concerning the Morphology and Phylogeny of the Arthropoda |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences |volume=233 |issue=606 |pages=483–580 |jstor=92441 |bibcode=1949RSPTB.233..483M |doi=10.1098/rstb.1949.0003}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, velvet worms are dependent upon [[habitat]]s with high air humidity.

===Digestion===
The digestive tract begins slightly behind the head, the mouth lying on the underside a little way from the frontmost point of the body. Here, prey can be mechanically dismembered by the mandibles with their covering of fine toothlets. Two [[saliva]]ry glands discharge via a common conductor into the subsequent "throat", which makes up the first part of the front [[intestine]]. The saliva that they produce contains mucus and [[hydrolysis|hydrolytic]] [[enzyme]]s, which initiate in and outside the mouth [[digestion]]. Historically, the salivary glands probably evolved from the waste-elimination organs known as nephridia, which are found homologously in the other body segments.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The throat itself is very muscular, serving to absorb the partially liquified food and to pump it, via the [[oesophagus]], which forms the rear part of the front intestine, into the central intestine. Unlike the front intestine, this is not lined with a cuticula but instead consists only of a single layer of epithelial tissue, which does not exhibit conspicuous indentation as is found in other animals. On entering the central intestine, food particles are coated with a mucus-based [[peritrophic membrane]], which serves to protect the lining of the intestine from damage by sharp-edged particles. The intestinal epithelium secretes further digestive enzymes and absorbs the released nutrients, although the majority of digestion has already taken place externally or in the mouth. Indigestible remnants arrive in the rear intestine, or [[rectum]], which is once again lined with a cuticula and which opens at the [[anus]], located on the underside near to the rear end.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In almost every segment is a pair of excretory organs called nephridia, which are derived from coelom tissue. Each consists of a small pouch that is connected, via a [[flagellum|flagellated]] conductor called a nephridioduct, to an opening at the base of the nearest leg known as a nephridiopore. The pouch is occupied by special cells called [[podocyte]]s, which facilitate [[ultrafiltration]] of the blood through the partition between haemocoelom and nephridium. The composition of the [[urine|urinary]] solution is modified in the nephridioduct by selective recovery of nutrients and water and by isolation of poison and waste materials, before it is excreted to the outside world via the nephridiopore. The most important nitrogenous excretion product is the water-insoluble [[uric acid]]; this can be excreted in solid state, with very little water. This so-called [[uricotelic]] excretory mode represents an adjustment to life on land and the associated necessity of dealing economically with water.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} A pair of former nephridia in the head were converted secondarily into the salivary glands, while another pair in the final segment of male specimens now serve as glands that apparently play a role in reproduction.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Sensation===
The entire body, including the stub feet, is littered with numerous papillae: warty protrusions that carry a [[mechanoreceptor|mechanoreceptive]] bristle (responsive to mechanical stimuli) at the tip, each of which is also connected to further [[sensory nerve cell]]s lying beneath. The mouth papillae, the exits of the slime glands, probably also have a function in [[sensory perception]]. Sensory cells known as "sensills" on the "lips" or labrum respond to chemical stimuli and are known as [[chemoreceptor]]s. These are also found on the two antennae, which can be regarded as the velvet worm's most important sensory organs. Except in a few (typically [[subterranea (geography)|subterranea]]n) species, one [[simple eye in invertebrates|simply constructed eye]] (ocellus) lies laterally, just underneath the head, behind each antenna.&lt;ref name=Mayer2006/&gt; This consists of a chitinous ball [[lens (anatomy)|lens]], a [[cornea]] and a [[retina]] and is connected to the centre of the [[brain]] via an [[optic nerve]].&lt;ref name=Mayer2006/&gt; The retina comprises numerous pigment cells and photoreceptors; the latter are easily modified flagellated cells, whose [[flagellum]] membranes carry a photosensitive pigment on their surface. The [[rhabdom]]eric eyes of the Onychophora are thought to be homologous with the median ocelli of arthropods; this would imply that the last common ancestor of arthropods bore only median ocelli.&lt;ref name=Mayer2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mayer |first1=Georg |date=December 2006 |title=Structure and development of onychophoran eyes: What is the ancestral visual organ in arthropods? |journal=Arthropod Structure &amp; Development |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=231–45 |pmid=18089073 |doi=10.1016/j.asd.2006.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the innervation shows that the homology is limited: the eyes of Onychophora form behind the antenna, whereas the opposite is true in arthropods.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |author= Eriksson, J. |title= Evolution and Development of the Onychophoran Head and Nervous System |year= 2003 |isbn= 91-554-5613-8 }}{{page needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
[[File:Dissected Euperipatoides.jpg|thumb|right|A dissected ''Euperipatoides kanangrensis''. The two ovaries, full of stage II embryos, are floating to the bottom of the image.]]
Both sexes possess pairs of [[gonad]]s, opening via a channel called a gonoduct into a common genital opening, the [[gonopore]], which is located on the rear ventral side. Both the gonads and the gonoduct are derived from true coelom tissue. In females, the two [[ovary|ovaries]] are joined in the middle and to the horizontal diaphragm. The gonoduct appears differently depending on whether the species is live-bearing or [[ovipary|egg-laying]]. In the former, each exit channel divides into a slender oviduct and a roomy "womb", the [[uterus]], in which the embryos develop. The single [[vagina]], to which both uteri are connected, runs outward to the gonopore. In egg-laying species, whose gonoduct is uniformly constructed, the genital opening lies at the tip of a long egg-laying apparatus, the [[ovipositor]]. The females of many species also possess a sperm repository called the receptacle seminis, in which sperm cells from males can be stored temporarily or for longer periods.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Males possess two separate [[testes]], along with the corresponding sperm vesicle (the [[vesicula seminalis]]) and exit channel (the [[vasa efferentia]]). The two vasa efferentia unite to a common sperm duct, the [[vas deferens]], which in turn widens through the ejaculatory channel to open at the gonopore. Directly beside or behind this lie two pairs of special glands, which probably serve an auxiliary reproductive function; the rearmost glands are also known as anal glands.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} A [[penis]]-like structure has so far only been found in males of the genus ''Paraperipatus'' but has not yet been observed in action.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} There are different mating procedures involved. In some the males deposit their [[spermatophore]] directly into the female's genitals opening, while others deposits it on the female's body, where the cuticle will collapse and allowing the sperm cells to migrate into the female. There are also Australian species where the male place their spermatophore on top of their head, which is then pressed against the female's genitals. In these species the head have elaborate structures like spikes, spines, hollow stylets, pits, and depressions, whose purpose is to either hold the sperm and/or assist in the sperm transfer to the female. The males of most species also secrete a pheromone from glands on the underside of the legs to attract females.&lt;ref&gt;[https://australianmuseum.net.au/velvet-worm Velvet worm - Australian Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the essential requirements for cave life were probably already present prior to the settlement of these habitats, this may be described as [[exaptation]]. [[Agriculture]] has apparently made available new habitats for velvet worms; in any case, they are found in man-made [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]] and [[banana]] [[plantations]] in South America and the Caribbean. Because the danger of [[desiccation]] is greatest during the day and in dry weather, it is not surprising that velvet worms are usually most active at night and during rainy weather. Under cold or dry conditions, they actively seek out crevices in which they shift their body into a resting state. Velvet worms are negatively phototactical: they are repelled by bright light sources.They are also rare.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Slime==
The Onychophora forcefully [[projectile use by living systems|squirt]] glue-like slime&lt;ref&gt;sometimes referred to as 'glue', but termed slime in current scientific literature, e.g. {{Cite journal | last1 = Baer | first1 = A. | last2 = Mayer | first2 = G. | doi = 10.1002/jmor.20044 | title = Comparative anatomy of slime glands in onychophora (velvet worms) | journal = Journal of Morphology | volume = 273 | issue = 10 | pages = 1079–1088 | date = October 2012 | pmid =  22707384| pmc = }}, {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/jzs.12070| title = Slime protein profiling: A non-invasive tool for species identification in Onychophora (velvet worms)| journal = Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research| volume = 52| issue = 4| pages = 265–272| year = 2014| last1 = Baer | first1 = A. | last2 = De Sena Oliveira | first2 = I. | last3 = Steinhagen | first3 = M. | last4 = Beck-Sickinger | first4 = A.

The slime glands themselves are deep inside the body cavity, each at the end of a tube more than half the length of the body. The tube both conducts the fluid and stores it until it is required. The distance that the animal can propel the slime varies; usually it squirts it about a centimetre,&lt;ref name=Benkendorff1999/&gt; but the maximal range has variously been reported to be ten centimetres,&lt;ref name= "ISBN 978-0-7993-4689-3"&gt;Holm, Erik, Dippenaar-Schoeman, Ansie; Goggo Guide; LAPA publishers (URL: WWW.LAPA.co.za) 2010{{page needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even nearly a foot,&lt;ref name= "CNH4"&gt;Harmer, Sir Sidney Frederic; Shipley, Arthur Everett et alia: The Cambridge natural history Volume 5, Peripatus, Myriapods, Insects.

==Behaviour==

===Locomotion===
[[File:Onycophora (515525252).jpg|thumb|right|A walking ''[[Peripatoides]]'' sp.]]
Velvet worms move in a slow and gradual motion that makes them difficult for prey to notice.&lt;ref name=Read1987/&gt; Their trunk is raised relatively high above the ground, and they walk with non-overlapping steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Teresa |last1=Zielinska |chapter=Biological Aspects of Locomotion |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=zzUojfLneW4C&amp;lpg=PA1 |pages=1–29 |doi=10.1007/978-3-7091-2772-8_1 |editor1-first=Friedrich |editor1-last=Pfeiffer |editor2-first=Teresa |editor2-last=Zielinska |year=2004 |title=Walking: Biological and Technological Aspects |isbn=978-3-211-22134-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To move from place to place, the velvet worm crawls forward using its legs; unlike in arthropods, both legs of a pair are moved simultaneously. The claws of the feet are only used on hard, rough terrain where a firm grip is needed; on soft substrates, such as moss, the velvet worm walks on the foot cushions at the base of the claws. The actual locomotion is achieved less by the exertion of the leg muscles than by local changes of body length. This can be controlled using the annular and longitudinal muscles. If the annular muscles are contracted, the body cross-section is reduced, and the corresponding segment lengthens; this is the usual mode of operation of the hydrostatic skeleton as also employed by other worms. Due to the stretching, the legs of the segment concerned are lifted and swung forward. Local contraction of the longitudinal muscles then shortens the appropriate segment, and the legs, which are now in contact with the ground, are moved to the rear. This part of the locomotive cycle is the actual leg stroke that is responsible for forward movement. The individual stretches and contractions of the segments are coordinated by the nervous system such that contraction waves run the length of the body, each pair of legs swinging forward and then down and rearward in succession. ''Macroperipatus'' can reach speeds of up to four centimetres per second,&lt;ref name=Read1987/&gt; although speeds of around 6 body-lengths per minute are more typical.&lt;ref name="doi10.1111/j.1096-3642.1950.tb01699.x"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1096-3642.1950.tb01699.x| title = The Evolution of Arthropodan Locomotory Mechanisms.-Part I.

M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body gets longer and narrower as the animal picks up speed; the length of each leg also varies during each stride.&lt;ref name="doi10.1111/j.1096-3642.1950.tb01699.x"/&gt;

===Sociality===
The brains of Onychophora, though small, are very complex; consequently, the organisms are capable of rather sophisticated social interactions.&lt;ref name=Reinhard2005&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Judith |last1=Reinhard |first2=David M. |last2=Rowell |date=September 2005 |title=Social behaviour in an Australian velvet worm, ''Euperipatoides rowelli'' (Onychophora: Peripatopsidae) |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=267 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |doi=10.1017/S0952836905007090}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviour may vary from genus to genus, so this article reflects the most studied genus, ''[[Euperipatoides]]''. They form social groups of up to fifteen individuals, usually closely related, which will typically live and hunt together. Groups usually live together; an example in drier regions would be in a region of the moist interior of a rotting log. Group members are extremely aggressive towards individuals from other logs.&lt;ref name=Reinhard2005/&gt; Dominance is achieved through aggression and maintained through submissive behaviour.&lt;ref name=Reinhard2005/&gt; After a kill, the dominant female always feeds first, followed in turn by the other females, then males, then the young.&lt;ref name=Reinhard2005/&gt; Social hierarchy is established by a number of interactions: higher-ranking individuals will chase and bite their subordinates while the latter are trying to crawl on top of them.&lt;ref name=Reinhard2005/&gt; Juveniles never engage in aggressive behaviour, but climb on top of adults, which tolerate their presence on their backs.&lt;ref name=Reinhard2005/&gt; When assessing other individuals, individuals often measure one another up by running their antennae down the length of the other individual.&lt;ref name=Reinhard2005/&gt; Once hierarchy has been established, paired individuals will often cluster together to form an aggregate; this is fastest in male-female pairings, followed by pairs of females, then pairs of males.&lt;ref name=Reinhard2005/&gt; Hierarchy is quickly established among individuals from a single group, but not among organisms from different groups; these are substantially more aggressive and very rarely climb one another or form aggregates.&lt;ref name=Reinhard2005/&gt; Individuals within an individual log are usually closely related; especially so with males. This may be related to the intense aggression between unrelated females.&lt;ref name=Reinhard2005/&gt;

===Feeding===
Velvet worms are ambush predators, hunting only by night,&lt;ref name=Read1987/&gt; and are able to capture animals at least their own size, although it may take almost all of their slime-secreting capacity to capture a large prey item.&lt;ref name="Dias Lo-Man-Hung 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Sidclay C. |last1=Dias |first2=Nancy F. |last2=Lo-Man-Hung |date=April 2009 |title=First record of an onychophoran (Onychophora, Peripatidae) feeding on a theraphosid spider (Araneae, Theraphosidae) |journal=Journal of Arachnology |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=116–7 |doi=10.1636/ST08-20.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They feed on almost any small invertebrates, including woodlice ([[Isopoda]]), termites ([[Isoptera]]), crickets ([[Gryllidae]]), book/bark lice ([[Psocoptera]]), cockroaches ([[Blattidae]]), millipedes and centipedes ([[Myriapoda]]), spiders ([[Araneae]]),&lt;ref name="Dias Lo-Man-Hung 2009"/&gt; various worms, and even large snails ([[Gastropoda]]). Depending on their size, they eat on average every one to four weeks.&lt;ref name=Read1987/&gt; They are considered to be [[ecology|ecological]]ly equivalent to centipedes ([[Chilopoda]]). The most energetically favourable prey are two-fifths the size of the hunting onychophoran.&lt;ref name=Read1987/&gt; Ninety percent of the time involved in eating prey is spent ingesting it; re-ingestion of the slime used to trap the insect is performed while the onychophoran locates a suitable place to puncture the prey, and this phase accounts for around 8% of the feeding time, with the remaining time evenly split between examining, squirting, and injecting the prey.&lt;ref name=Read1987/&gt;  In some cases, chunks of the prey item are bitten off and swallowed; undigestable components take around 18 hours to pass through the digestive tract.&lt;ref name=Mayer2015/&gt; Onychophora probably do not primarily use vision to detect their prey; although their tiny eyes do have a good image-forming capacity, their forward vision is obscured by their antennae;&lt;ref name=Read1987/&gt; their nocturnal habit also limits the utility of eyesight. Air currents, formed by prey motion, are thought to be the primary mode of locating prey; the role of scent, if any, is unclear.&lt;ref name=Read1987/&gt; Because it takes so long to ingest a prey item, hunting mainly happens around dusk; the onychophorans will abandon their prey at sunrise.&lt;ref name=Read1987/&gt; This predatory way of life is probably a consequence of the velvet worm's need to remain moist. Due to the continual risk of desiccation, often only a few hours per day are available for finding food. This leads to a strong selection for a low cost-benefit ratio, which cannot be achieved with a herbivorous diet.

Velvet worms literally creep up on their prey, with their smooth, gradual and fluid movement escaping detection by predators.&lt;ref name=Read1987/&gt; Once they reach their prey, they touch it very softly with their antennae to assess its size and nutritional value. After each poke, the antenna is hastily retracted to avoid detection by the prey individual.&lt;ref name=Read1987/&gt; This investigation may last anywhere upwards of ten seconds, until the velvet worm makes a decision as to whether to attack it, or until it disturbs the prey and the prey flees.&lt;ref name='Read1987'&gt;{{cite journal |first1=V.

They have been observed to spend up to ten minutes searching for removed prey, after which they return to their slime to eat it.&lt;ref name=Read1987/&gt; In the case of smaller prey, they may opt not to use slime at all.&lt;ref name=Read1987/&gt; Subsequently, a soft part of the prey item (usually a joint membrane in arthropod prey) is identified, punctured with a bite from the jaws, and injected with saliva. This kills the prey very quickly and begins a slower process of digestion.&lt;ref name=Read1987/&gt; While the onychophoran waits for the prey to digest, it salivates on its slime and begins to eat it (and anything attached to it). It subsequently tugs and slices at the earlier perforation to allow access to the now-liquefied interior of its prey.&lt;ref name=Read1987/&gt;  The jaws operate by moving backwards and forwards along the axis of the body (not in a side-to-side clipping motion as in arthropods), conceivably using a pairing of musculature and hydrostatic pressure.&lt;ref name=Mayer2015&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/icb/icv004| title = Capture of Prey, Feeding, and Functional Anatomy of the Jaws in Velvet Worms (Onychophora)| journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology| year = 2015| last1 = Mayer | first1 = G.| last2 = Oliveira | first2 = I.

Subsequently, subordinate individuals begin to feed. The number of males reaches a peak after females start to leave the prey item.&lt;ref name=Reinhard2005/&gt; After feeding, individuals clean their antennae and mouth parts before re-joining the rest of their group.&lt;ref name=Reinhard2005/&gt;

===Reproduction and life-cycle===
Almost all species of velvet worm reproduce sexually. The sole exception is ''[[Epiperipatus imthurni]]'', of which no males have been observed; reproduction instead occurs by [[parthenogenesis]].&lt;ref name='Read1988'&gt;{{cite journal |first1=V. M. St. J. |last1=Read |date=July 1988 |title=The Onychophora of Trinidad, Tobago, and the Lesser Antilles |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=225–57 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1988.tb01362.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; All species are in principle sexually distinct and bear, in many cases, a marked [[sexual dimorphism]]: the [[female]]s are usually larger than the [[male]]s and have, in species where the number of legs is variable, more legs. The females of many species are fertilized only once during their lives, which leads to [[animal sexual behavior|copulation]] sometimes taking place before the [[reproductive organ]]s of the females are fully developed. In such cases, for example at the age of three months in ''[[Macroperipatus torquatus]]'', the transferred sperm cells are kept in a special [[reservoir]], where they can remain [[:wikt:viable|viable]] for longer periods. Fertilization takes place [[internal fertilisation|internally]], although the mode of [[sperm]] transmission varies widely. In most species, for example in the [[genus]] ''[[Peripatus]]'', a package of sperm cells called the [[spermatophore]] is placed into the genital opening of the female. The detailed process by which this is achieved is in most cases still unknown, a true [[penis]] having only been observed in species of the genus ''Paraperipatus''. In many Australian species, there exist [[dimple]]s or special [[dagger]]- or [[axe]]-shaped structures on the head; the male of ''[[Florelliceps stutchburyae]]'' presses a long [[spine (zoology)|spine]] against the female's genital opening and probably positions its spermatophore there in this way. During the process, the female supports the male by keeping him clasped with the claws of her last pair of legs. The mating behavior of two species of the genus ''[[Peripatopsis]]'' is particularly curious. Here, the male places two-millimetre spermatophores on the back or sides of the female. [[Amoebocyte]]s from the female's [[blood]] collect on the inside of the [[wikt:deposition|deposition]] site, and both the spermatophore's casing and the body wall on which it rests are decomposed via the [[secretion]] of [[enzyme]]s. This releases the sperm cells, which then move freely through the [[haemocoel]], penetrate the external wall of the ovaries and finally fertilize the [[ovum|ova]]. Why this self-inflicted skin injury does not lead to bacterial infections is not yet understood (though likely related to the enzymes used to deteriorate the skin or facilitate the transfer of viable genetic material from male to female). Velvet worms are found in egg-laying ([[ovipary|oviparous]]), egg-live-bearing ([[ovovivipary|ovoviviparous]]) and live-bearing ([[viviparity|viviparous]]) forms.

*Ovipary occurs solely in the Peripatopsidae, often in regions with erratic food supply or unsettled climate. In these cases, the [[yolk]]-rich [[egg (biology)|egg]]s measure 1.3 to 2.0&amp;nbsp;mm and are coated in a protective chitinous shell. [[Maternal]] care is unknown.
*The majority of species are ovoviviparous: the medium-sized eggs, encased only by a double membrane, remain in the [[uterus]]. The [[embryo]]s do not receive food directly from the mother, but are supplied instead by the moderate quantity of yolk contained in the eggs—they are therefore described as [[lecithotrophic]]. The young emerge from the eggs only a short time before birth. This probably represents the velvet worm's original mode of reproduction, i.e., both oviparous and viviparous species developed from ovoviviparous species.
*True live-bearing species are found in both families, particularly in tropical regions with a stable climate and regular food supply throughout the year. The embryos develop from eggs only micrometres in size and are nourished in the uterus by their mother, hence the description "[[matrotrophic]]". The supply of food takes place either via a secretion from the mother directly into the uterus or via a genuine tissue connection between the epithelium of the uterus and the developing embryo, known as a [[placenta]]. The former is found only outside the American continents, while the latter occurs primarily in America and the Caribbean and more rarely in the [[Old World]]. The [[gestation]] period can amount to up to 15&amp;nbsp;months, at the end of which the [[offspring]] emerge in an advanced stage of development. The embryos found in the uterus of a single female do not necessarily have to be of the same age; it is quite possible for there to be offspring at different stages of development and descended from different males. In some species, young tend to be released only at certain points in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muriel H. |last1=Walker |first2=Noel N. |last2=Tait |date=December 2004 |title=Studies of embryonic development and the reproductive cycle in ovoviviparous Australian Onychophora (Peripatopsidae) |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=264 |issue=4 |pages=333–54 |doi=10.1017/S0952836904005837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A female can have between 1 and 23 offspring per year; development from fertilized ovum to adult takes between 6 and 17&amp;nbsp;months and does not have a [[larva]]l stage. This is probably also the original mode of development. Velvet worms have been known to live for up to six years.

==Ecology==
The velvet worm's important predators are primarily various spiders and centipedes, along with [[rodent]]s and [[bird]]s, such as, in Central America, the clay-coloured thrush (''[[Turdus grayi]]''). In South America, Hemprichi's coral snake (''[[Micrurus hemprichii]]'') feeds almost exclusively on velvet worms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mongenajera|first1=J.|last2=Barrientos|first2=Z.|last3=Aguilar|first3=F.|title=Behaviour of ''Epiperipatus-biolleyi'' (Onychophora, Peripatidae) laboratory conditions|journal=Revista de Biologica Tropical|date=1993|volume=41|issue=3A|pages=689–696}}&lt;/ref&gt; For defence, some species roll themselves reflexively into a spiral, while they can also fight off smaller opponents by ejecting slime. Various [[mite]]s ([[Acari]]) are known to be [[ectoparasite]]s infesting the skin of the velvet worm. Skin injuries are usually accompanied by bacterial infections, which are almost always fatal.

==Conservation==
The global [[conservation biology|conservation]] status of velvet worm species is difficult to estimate; many species are only known to exist at their type locality (the location at which they were first observed and described). The collection of reliable data is also hindered by low population densities, their typically [[nocturnal]] behaviour and possibly also as-yet undocumented seasonal influences and sexual dimorphism. To date, the only onychophorans evaluated by the [[IUCN]] are: ''[[Mesoperipatus tholloni]]'' (Data Deficient), ''[[Plicatoperipatus jamaicensis]]'' (Near Threatened), ''[[Peripatoides indigo]]'' (Vulnerable), ''[[Peripatoides suteri]]'' (Vulnerable), ''[[Peripatopsis alba]]'' (Vulnerable), ''[[Peripatopsis clavigera]]'' (Vulnerable), ''[[Macroperipatus insularis]]'' (Endangered), ''[[Tasmanipatus anophthalmus]]'' (Endangered), ''[[Opisthopatus roseus]]'' (Critically Endangered), ''[[Peripatopsis leonina]]'' (Critically Endangered), and ''[[Speleoperipatus spelaeus]]'' (Critically Endangered).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/search.php?freetext=Onychophora&amp;modifier=phrase&amp;criteria=wholedb&amp;taxa_species=1&amp;redlistCategory%5B%5D=all&amp;country%5B%5D=all&amp;cty_default=1&amp;aquatic%5B%5D=all&amp;aqu_default=1&amp;regions%5B%5D=all&amp;reg_default=1&amp;habitats%5B%5D=all&amp;threats%5B%5D=all&amp;redlistAssessyear%5B%5D=all&amp;growths%5B%5D=all 2007 IUCN Red List&amp;nbsp;– Search]{{dead link|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary threat comes from destruction and fragmentation of velvet worm habitat due to [[industrialisation]], draining of [[wetland]]s, and [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture. Many species also have naturally low population densities and closely restricted geographic ranges; as a result, relatively small localised disturbances of important [[ecosystem]]s can lead to the extinction of entire populations or species. Collection of specimens for universities or research institutes also plays a role on a local scale.&lt;ref name="trnew"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=New|first1=Tim R|title=Onychophora in invertebrate conservation: priorities, practice and prospects|journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|date=1995|volume=114|issue=1|pages=77–89|doi=10.1006/zjls.1995.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a very pronounced difference in the protection afforded to velvet worms between regions: in some countries, such as South Africa, there are restrictions on both collecting and [[export]]ing, while in others, such as Australia, only export restrictions exist. Many countries offer no specific safeguards at all. Tasmania has a protection programme that is unique worldwide: one region of forest has its own velvet worm conservation plan, which is tailored to a particular velvet worm species.&lt;ref name="trnew" /&gt;

==Phylogeny==
[[File:Eoperipatus totoro.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Eoperipatus totoro]]'']]
In their present forms, the velvet worms are probably very closely related to the arthropods, a very extensive taxon that incorporates, for instance, the crustaceans, insects, and arachnids. They share, among other things, an exoskeleton consisting of  α-chitin and non-collagenous proteins; gonads and waste-elimination organs enclosed in true coelom tissue; an open blood system with a tubular heart situated at the rear; an abdominal cavity divided into pericardial and perivisceral cavities; respiration via tracheae; and similar embryonic development. Segmentation, with two body appendages per segment, is also shared. However, antennae, mandibles, and oral papillae are probably not homologous to the corresponding features in arthropods, i.e., they probably developed independently. Another closely related group are the comparatively obscure water bears ([[Tardigrada]]); however, due to their very small size, these lack some characteristics of the velvet worms and arthropods, such as blood circulation and separate respiratory structures. Together, the velvet worms, arthropods, and water bears form a [[monophyletic]] taxon, the [[Panarthropoda]], i.e., the three groups collectively cover all descendants of their last common ancestor. Due to certain similarities of form, the velvet worms were usually grouped with the water bears to form the taxon Protoarthropoda. This designation would imply that both velvet worms and water bears are not yet as highly developed as the arthropods. Modern systematic theories reject such conceptions of "primitive" and "highly developed" organisms and instead consider exclusively the historical relationships among the taxa. These relationships are not as yet fully understood, but it is considered probable that the velvet worms' sister groups form a taxon designated [[Tactopoda]], thus:{{clade|{{clade|1=
{{nowrap|Velvet worms (Onychophora)}}|label2=[[Tactopoda]]|2={{clade|1=
Water bears ([[Tardigrada]])|2=
Arthropods ([[Arthropoda]])}}}}|label1=[[Panarthropoda]]}}For a long time, velvet worms were also considered related to the [[annelid]]s. They share, among other things, a worm-like body; a thin and flexible outer skin; a layered musculature; paired waste-elimination organs; as well as a simply constructed brain and simple eyes. Decisive, however, was the existence of segmentation in both groups, with the segments showing only minor specialisation. The parapodia appendages found in annelids therefore correspond to the stump feet of the velvet worms. Within the [[Articulata hypothesis]] developed by [[Georges Cuvier]], the velvet worms therefore formed an evolutionary link between the annelids and the arthropods: worm-like precursors first developed parapodia, which then developed further into stub feet as an intermediate link in the ultimate development of the arthropods' appendages. Due to their structural conservatism, the velvet worms were thus considered "living fossils". This perspective was expressed paradigmatically in the statement by the French zoologist A. Vandel:

:''Onychophorans can be considered highly evolved annelids, adapted to terrestrial life, which announced prophetically the Arthropoda. They are a lateral branch which has endured from ancient times until today, without important modifications.''

Modern taxonomy does not study criteria such as "higher" and "lower" states of development or distinctions between "main" and "side" branches—only family relationships indicated by [[cladistic]] methods are considered relevant. From this point of view, several common characteristics still support the Articulata hypothesis — segmented body; paired appendages on each segment; pairwise arrangement of waste-elimination organs in each segment; and above all, a rope-ladder-like nervous system based on a double nerve strand lying along the belly. An alternative concept, most widely accepted today, is the so-called [[Ecdysozoa]] [[hypothesis]]. This places the annelids and Panarthropoda in two very different groups: the former in the [[Lophotrochozoa]] and the latter in the Ecdysozoa. Mitochondrial gene sequences also provide support for this hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |title= The Complete Mitochondrial Genome of the Onychophoran ''Epiperipatus biolleyi'' Reveals a Unique Transfer RNA Set and Provides Further Support for the Ecdysozoa Hypothesis |author1=Podsiadlowski, L. |author2=Braband. A. |author3=Mayer, G. |journal= Molecular Biology and Evolution |year=January 2008 |volume= 25 |issue= 1 |pages= 42–51 |doi= 10.1093/molbev/msm223 |pmid= 17934206 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this hypothesis assume that the aforementioned similarities between annelids and velvet worms either developed convergently or were primitive characteristics passed unchanged from a common ancestor to both the Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa. For example, in the first case, the rope-ladder nervous system would have developed in the two groups independently, while in the second case, it is a very old characteristic, which does not imply a particularly close relationship between the annelids and Panarthropoda. The Ecdysozoa concept divides the taxon into two, the Panarthropoda into which the velvet worms are placed, and the sister group [[Cycloneuralia]], containing the threadworms ([[Nematoda]]), horsehair worms ([[Nematomorpha]]) and three rather obscure groups: the mud dragons ([[Kinorhyncha]]); penis worms ([[Priapulida]]); and brush-heads ([[Loricifera]]).

{{nowrap|Panarthropoda (arthropods, velvet worms, water bears)}}|2=
Cycloneuralia (threadworms, horsehair worms, and others)}}
|2=Lophotrochozoa (annelids, molluscs, and others)|3=Others}}}}

Particularly characteristic of the Cycloneuralia is a ring of "circumoral" nerves around the mouth opening, which the proponents of the Ecdysozoa hypothesis also recognise in modified form in the details of the nerve patterns of the Panarthropoda. Both groups also share a common skin-shedding mechanism ([[ecdysis]]) and molecular biological similarities. One problem of the Ecdysozoa hypothesis is the velvet worms' subterminal mouth position: unlike in the Cycloneuralia, the mouth is not at the front end of the body, but lies further back under the belly. However, investigations into their developmental biology, particularly regarding the development of the head nerves, suggest that this was not always the case and that the mouth was originally terminal (situated at the tip of the body). This is supported by the [[fossil record]]. The "stem-group arthropod" hypothesis is very widely accepted, but some trees suggest that the onychophorans may occupy a different position; their brain anatomy is more closely related to that of the [[chelicerate]]s than to any other arthropod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Nicholas J. |last1=Strausfeld |first2=Camilla Mok |last2=Strausfeld |first3=Rudi |last3=Loesel |first4=David |last4=Rowell |first5=Sally |last5=Stowe |title=Arthropod phylogeny: onychophoran brain organization suggests an archaic relationship with a chelicerate stem lineage |journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences |volume=273 |issue=1596 |pages=1857–66 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16822744 |pmc=1634797 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.3536}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern velvet worms form a monophyletic group, incorporating all the descendants of their common ancestor. Important common derivative characteristics ([[synapomorphy|synapomorphies]]) include, for example, the mandibles of the second body segment and the oral papillae and associated slime glands of the third; nerve strands extending along the underside with numerous cross-linkages per segment; and the special form of the tracheae. By 2011, some 180 modern species, comprising 49 [[genus|genera]], had been described;&lt;ref name=Zhang2011&gt;{{ cite journal |last=Zhang |first=Zhi-Qiang |title=Animal biodiversity: An introduction to higher-level classification and taxonomic richness |journal=Zootaxa |year=2011 |volume=3148 |pages=7–12 |isbn=978-1-86977-849-1 |url=http://mapress.com/zootaxa/2011/f/zt03148p012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the actual number of species is probably about twice this. According to more recent study, 82 species of Peripatidae and 115 species of Peripatopsidae have been described thus far. However, among these 197 species, 20 are [[nomen dubium|nomina dubia]] due to major taxonomic inconsistencies.&lt;ref name="Oliveira et al.2012"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Ivo de Sena |last1=Oliveira |first2=V.

All genera are assigned to one of two families, the distribution ranges of which do not overlap but are separated by arid areas or oceans:

*The Peripatopsidae exhibit relatively many characteristics that are perceived as original or "primitive". They have between 13 and 25 pairs of legs, behind or between the last of which is the genital opening (gonopore). Both oviparous and ovoviviparous, as well as genuinely viviparous, species exist, although the Peripatopsidae essentially lack a placenta. Their distribution is circumaustral, encompassing [[Australasia]], [[South Africa]], and [[Chile]].&lt;ref name="Oliveira et al.2012" /&gt;
*The Peripatidae exhibit a range of derivative features. They are longer, on average, than the Peripatopsidae and also have more leg pairs, numbering between 22 and 43—the gonopore is always between the penultimate pair. There are no oviparous species—the overwhelming majority are viviparous. The females of many viviparous species develop a placenta with which to provide the growing embryo with nutrients. Distribution of the Peripatidae is restricted to the tropical and subtropical zones; in particular, they inhabit [[Central America]], northern [[South America]], [[Gabon]], [[Northeast India]], and [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="Oliveira et al.2012" /&gt;

==Evolution==
Fossils from the early Cambrian bear a striking resemblance to the velvet worms. These fossils, known collectively as the [[lobopodian]]s, were marine and represent a grade from which arthropods, tardigrades, and Onychophora arose.&lt;ref name="Cite doi|10.1038/nature13576"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature13576 | pmid = 25132546 | journal = Nature | volume = 514 | issue = 7522 | pages = 363–366 | last1 = Smith | first1 = M.

'''Orgetorix''' was a wealthy aristocrat among the [[Helvetii]], a Celtic-speaking people residing in what is now [[Switzerland]] during the consulship of [[Julius Caesar]] of the [[Roman Republic]].

==Planned migration==
In 61 BC he convinced the Helvetians to attempt to migrate from Helvetian territory to south-western [[Gaul]] (modern-day [[France]]). He was also party to a clandestine arrangement with [[Dumnorix]] of the [[Aedui]] and [[Casticus]] of the [[Sequani]] to seize control of their respective tribes by arms and between them rule most of Gaul. The conspiracy was denounced, Orgetorix was called to a hearing in chains before the government of the Helvetii, he arrived with a small army, and was released, but died mysteriously, a rumored suicide. The Helvetians went on with their plans for migration but were defeated in 58 BC and returned by Julius Caesar. This incident was the beginning of the Gallic War in which Caesar subjugated Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/242308971/Interea-Caesar-Ea-Legione|title=Interea Caesar Ea Legione|website=Scribd|accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julius Pokorny]] segments the name [P]orgeto-rix, where the first element contains Gallic ''orge'', "kill,", related to [[Old Irish]] ''orcaid'', "kill," from the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] root *per-g-, "to hit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Julius |last=Pokorny |authorlink=Julius Pokorny |title=per-3, per-g- |pages=818–819 |encyclopedia=indogermanisches etymologisches woerterbuch |year=2005 |origyear=1959 |location=Leiden |publisher=Leiden University, the IEED-project |url=http://www.indoeuropean.nl/cgi-bin/startq.cgi?flags=endnnnl&amp;root=leiden&amp;basename=%5Cdata%5Cie%5Cpokorny |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809064309/http://www.indoeuropean.nl/cgi-bin/startq.cgi?flags=endnnnl&amp;root=leiden&amp;basename=%5Cdata%5Cie%5Cpokorny |archivedate=August 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second element is manifestly Celtic ''rīx'', "king:" "warrior-king," which does not imply that the owner of the name is necessarily a legal ruler. Although Orgetorix had aspirations in that direction, he was not one.

==Social position==
According to Caesar's I.2 of ''De Bello Gallico'', Orgetorix was by far the wealthiest and noblest. He made himself an ambassador on behalf of the [[Helvetians]] to the other Gallic tribes, and he gave his own daughter to Dumnorix as a ''bona fide'' gesture. Orgetorix failed in his attempt to become one of three ruling triumvirs of [[Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/caesar/gall1.shtml|title=Caesar: Bellum Gallicum I|website=www.thelatinlibrary.com|accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plan for migration==
The Helvetians made elaborate plans for making such a journey. According to Caesar, they spent two years sowing crops and buying beasts of burden, intending for the migration to start in the third year. The effort came by way of marital exchange and individual alliances among some of the young nobles from all three tribes.

==Conspiracy==
Orgetorix was intending to make an unlawful attempt in seizing control of all Gaul, with Dumnorix and Casticus as his other triumvirs. Unknown to the Helvetians, Orgetorix was making a deal that would involve the use of Helvetian soldiers to seize control of all Gaul, instead of a mere migration. If the conspiracy was to be carried out, the Aeduans, Sequanians and Helvetians, under the threesome, would have all of Gaul at their disposal.

==Trial==
Rivals among the Helvetii discovered Orgetorix's plot and moved to put him on trial, with the penalty of death by burning if found guilty. In assisting his efforts to avoid that fate, Orgetorix had meanwhile acquired a significant personal retinue in addition to having called up an army of more than 10,000 men at arms in addition to their mobilized clients, followers and dependents.

==Death==
Many Helvetians suspected that Orgetorix committed suicide rather than face death by burning. According to Roman accounts, he managed to evade pleading his case, but as the magistrates forced away the crowd of persons from the fields, Orgetorix died. Nonetheless, the Helvetians continued their attempt to migrate.

==Family and personal life==
Aamer was born on 21 December 1966 and grew up in [[Medina]] in Saudi Arabia. He left the country at the age of 17. He lived and traveled in the United States, Europe and the Middle East.&lt;ref name=independent1/&gt; Aamer lived and studied in Georgia and Maryland in 1989 and 1990. During the [[Gulf War]], he worked as a translator for the [[U.S. Army]].&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/11-years-in-guantanamo-without-trial-or-charges/|title = 11 years in Guantanamo without trial or charges|author = Phil Hirschkorn|date = March 31, 2013|access-date = November 1, 2015|publisher = [[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to the United Kingdom in 1996 where he met Zin Siddique, a British woman; they married in 1997 and he established legal [[residency (domicile)|residency]] in Britain. They have four British children, the youngest of whom Aamer had never met, due to his having been born after Aamer's imprisonment.&lt;ref name=Bbc050208&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4245517.stm "Calls to free Guantanamo father"], [[BBC]], 8 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Aamer had indefinite leave to remain in the UK, and was applying for British citizenship.&lt;ref name=grauniad/&gt;

Aamer worked as an Arabic translator for [[London]] law firms. Some of the solicitors he worked for dealt with [[immigration]] cases. In his spare time, Aamer helped refugees find accommodation and offered them advice on their struggles with the [[Home Office]].&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/shaker-aamer-guantanamos-last-british-detainee-1914791.html|title=Shaker Aamer: Guantanamo's last British detainee|work=The Independent|date=3 March 2010|accessdate=5 January 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Aamer's family lived in [[Battersea]], South London. His wife Zin Aamer suffered from [[Mood disorder|depression]] and mental episodes since his arrest.&lt;ref name="independent2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheIndependent5Jan2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/wandsworthnews/9446170.Ten_years_in_custody_without_charge_for_Shaker_Aamer/|title=Ten years in custody without charge for Battersea's Shaker Aamer|work=Your Local Guardian|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed Siddique, Aamer's father-in-law, said in 2011, "When he was captured, Shaker offered to let my daughter divorce him, but she said, 'No, I will wait for you.' She is still waiting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Cahalan, Paul |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/obamas-uturn-on-guantanamo-seals-fate-of-lone-briton-6283796.html |title=Obama's U-turn on Guantanamo seals fate of lone Briton |work=The Independent|location=UK|date=1 January 2012|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture and allegations==
[[File:Abdul Shaker with Children.jpg|240px|right|thumb|

Aamer took his family to Afghanistan in 2001, where he was working for an Islamic charity when the U.S. invaded the country later that year.&lt;ref name="Bbc050208"/&gt; The [[Northern Alliance]] took him into custody in [[Jalalabad]] in December 2001, and passed him to the Americans. The US routinely paid ransom for Arabs handed over to them.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; They interrogated Aamer at [[Bagram Theater Internment Facility]] and transported him to Guantánamo on 14 February 2002.

According to [[Joint Task Force Guantanamo]] assessments from 1 November 2007, the US military believed that Aamer was a "recruiter, financier, and facilitator" for [[al-Qaeda]], based partly on spurious evidence given by the informant [[Yasim Muhammed Basardah]], a fellow detainee.&lt;ref name=20110503cahalan/&gt; The leaked documents alleged that Aamer had confessed to interrogators that he was in [[Tora Bora]] with Osama bin Laden at the time of the US bombing.&lt;ref name="eluded-US-during-10-year-manhunt"/&gt; The documents further note that the Saudi intelligence [[Mabahith]] identified Aamer "as a high priority for the government of Saudi Arabia, an indication of his law enforcement value to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leigh|first1=David|last2=Cobain|first2=Ian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-files-shaker-aamer-british|title=Guantánamo Bay files: Shaker Aamer, inmate from Britain the US won't let go|date=24 April 2011|work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the [[Guantanamo Review Task Force]] released their report of the detainee assessments. In many instances, the Task Force largely agreed with prior [[threat assessment]]s of the detainees and sometimes found additional information that further substantiated such assessments. In other instances, the Task Force found prior assessments to be overstated. Some assessments, for example, contained allegations that were not supported by the underlying source document upon which they relied. Other assessments contained conclusions that were stated categorically even though derived from uncorroborated statements or raw intelligence reporting of undetermined or questionable reliability. Conversely, in a few cases, the Task Force discovered reliable information indicating that a detainee posed a greater threat in some respects than prior assessments suggested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/ag/guantanamo-review-final-report.pdf#page=13 Guantanamo Review Task Force Final Report], (p.&amp;nbsp;9)&lt;/ref&gt;

Aamer denies being involved in terrorist activity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/last-brit-guantanamo-shaker-aamer-diagnosed-post-traumatic-stress-1443869|title=Last Brit in Guantanamo Shaker Aamer Diagnosed With Post Traumatic Stress|work=International Business Times UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his attorney, Clive Stafford Smith of [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]], said the evidence against his client "would not stand up in court." He pointed out that part of the evidence comes from [[Yasim Muhammed Basardah]], whom American judges found to be "utterly incredible" and who was tortured and "promised all sorts of things."&lt;ref name=20110503cahalan/&gt;

The Bush administration acknowledged later that it had no evidence against Aamer, and he was cleared for transfer in 2007.&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheScotsman9Jan2012/&gt;  The clearance was for transfer to Saudi Arabia only.&lt;ref name="GuardianTownsend20130420"/&gt;

==Aamer's allegations of being tortured in Bagram ==
In September 2009, [[Zachary Philip Katznelson|Zachary Katznelson]], a Reprieve lawyer, said that Aamer had told of suffering severe beatings at the Bagram facility. Aamer said that close to a dozen men had beaten him, including interrogators who represented themselves as officers of [[MI5]], the United Kingdom's internal counter-terrorism agency. Following one severe beating, he recovered from being stunned to find that all the interrogators had left the room and put a pistol on the table.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2009-09-06/&gt; He did not determine if the pistol was loaded. He said it occurred to him that it had been left either so he could kill himself, or that, if he picked it up, he could be shot and killed on the excuse he was trying to shoot them.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2009-09-06/&gt;

Aamer says that the "MI5" interrogators told him he had two choices: (1) agree to spy on suspected jihadists in the United Kingdom; or (2) remain in US custody.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2009-09-06&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/06/guantanamo-gun-abuse-cia-mi5|title='MI5 agent left me alone with gun', says Guantánamo terror detainee|date=6 September 2009|author=Doward, Jamie|work=The Guardian|location=London|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Fworld%2F2009%2Fsep%2F06%2Fguantanamo-gun-abuse-cia-mi5&amp;date=2009-09-06|archivedate=6 September 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that guards/agents repeatedly knocked his head against the wall while an MI5 officer was in the room.

==Guantanamo==
Aamer has been described as an unofficial [[Spokesperson|spokesman]] for the detainees at Guantanamo. He has spoken up for the welfare of prisoners, negotiating with camp commanders and organizing protests against cruel treatment. He organized and participated in a [[Guantánamo Bay hunger strikes|hunger strike in 2005]] in which he lost half of his weight. He demanded the prisoners be treated according to the [[Geneva Convention]], allowing the detainees to form a grievance committee. In negotiations, the camp administration promised a healthier diet for the prisoners after he agreed to end the hunger strike.&lt;ref name=independent1/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheIndependent20070914/&gt; His lawyer Stafford Smith said the grievance committee was formed, but that the camp authorities disbanded it after a few days. American spokesmen Major Jeffrey Weir denied that the Americans had ever agreed to any conditions resulting from the hunger strike.

In September 2006, Aamer's attorneys filed a 16-page motion arguing for his removal from isolation in Guantanamo Bay prison. They argued extended periods of isolation were detrimental to his mental and physical health.&lt;ref name=Spectacle&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spectacle.co.uk/projects_page.php?id=486|title=Updates - Shaker Aamer|work=Spectacle|location=UK|date=4 September 2012|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aamer continued to take part in additional hunger strikes and was held in solitary confinement for most of the time. His lawyers described his solitary confinement as "cruel" and said his health was affected to a point where they feared for his life. In 2011 Stafford Smith, director of the UK branch of Reprieve, said Aamer is "falling apart at the seams."&lt;ref name="morningstaronline1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheIndependentJan2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg |first=Carol |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/12/24/2560773/secret-guantanamo-cell-block-cost.html |title=Secret Guantánamo cell block cost nearly $700,000 – Guantánamo |work=Miami Herald |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 2006, Aamer's attorneys filed a 16-page motion arguing for his removal from isolation in Guantanamo Bay prison.&lt;ref name=Cnn060918&gt;

The next day Katznelson filed a motion to enforce the Geneva Conventions on his behalf.&lt;ref name=Habeas04cv2215-2006-09-19&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

After President [[Barack Obama]] was elected, in 2009 he convened a six-agency task force to review the status of detainees at Guantanamo. It "unanimously recommended" transfer of Aamer.&lt;ref name="nytOct15"/&gt; Security officials wanted to send him to Saudi Arabia, his country of citizenship, but his attorneys argued for him to be transferred to Great Britain, where he had been resident and had family.&lt;ref name="nytOct15"&gt;Charles Savage and Steven Erlanger, "Guantánamo Release Ends Yearslong Battle", ''New York Times'', 31 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Aamer's lawyer Brent Mickum, who saw him in Guantánamo, alleges that Aamer was repeatedly beaten before their meetings. He said that Aamer's mental and physical health is deteriorating. "It felt like he has given up: that's what 10 years, mostly in solitary confinement will do to a person," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/last-briton-in-guantanamo-on-hunger-strike |title=Last Briton in Guantanamo on hunger strike |publisher=Channel 4 News |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Binyam Mohamed]], an Ethiopian prisoner who formerly occupied a cell one door down from Aamer, has said since his release that he knows why Aamer is still in the prison camps.&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would say the Americans are trying to keep him as silent as they could. It's not that he has anything. What happened in 2005 and 2006 is something that the Americans don't want the world to know – hunger strikes, and all the events that took place, until the three brothers who died ... insider information of all the events, probably. Obviously, Shaker doesn't have it, but the Americans think he may have some of it, and they don't like this kind of information being released.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clive Stafford Smith, his lawyer and director of human rights organisation Reprieve, came to a similar conclusion. He said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/wandsworthnews/5001740._Heartbreaking__moment_Shaker_Aamer_saw_first_photo_of_son/ |title='Heartbreaking' moment Shaker Aamer saw first photo of son |work=Your Local Guardian |date=11 February 2010 |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have known Shaker for some time, because he is so eloquent and outspoken about the injustices of Guantanamo he is very definitely viewed as a threat by the US. Not in the sense of being an extremist but in the sense of being someone who can rather eloquently criticise the nightmare that happened there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Omar Deghayes]], a former Guantanamo Detainee who knew Aamer, said of him,

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was always forward, he would translate for people, he'd fight for them, and if he had any problems in the block he'd shout at the guards... until he would get you your rights. And that's why he's still in prison... because he's very outspoken, a very intelligent person, somebody who would fight for somebody else's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectacle.co.uk/projects_page.php?id=485 |title='Spectacle Shaker Aamer |work= Spectacle |date=31 May 2012 |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===At Camp "No" on June 2006===
{{main|Guantanamo Bay homicide accusations}}
In an article published in 2010, Aamer said that he was beaten for hours and subjected to interrogation methods that included [[asphyxiation]] on 9 June 2006, the same day that [[Guantanamo Bay homicide accusations|three fellow prisoners died in Guantanamo]]. The United States claimed these deaths were suicides.&lt;ref name=Harpers2010-01-18/&gt;

Describing his treatment, Aamer said that he was strapped to a chair, fully restrained at the head, arms and legs. When MPs pressed on pressure points all over his body: his temples, just under his jawline, in the hollow beneath his ears. They bent his nose repeatedly, pinched his thighs and feet. They inflicted pain to his eyes, bent his fingers until he screamed and then they cut off his airway and put a mask over him, so he could not cry out.&lt;ref name=Harpers2010-01-18&gt;

The law professor [[Scott Horton (attorney)|Scott Horton]] published an award-winning article on the 2006 deaths in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in 2010, suggesting that these were cases of homicide caused by extended torture, rather than suicide. He said that Aamer had been brought to "[[Camp No, Guantanamo|Camp No]]," a secret interrogation [[black site]] outside the camp, with the three men who died on the day of the event. Horton described Aamer's account of having his airways cut off as "alarming" and wrote, "This is the same technique that appears to have been used on the three deceased prisoners."&lt;ref name=Harpers2010-01-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2010-01-18/&gt; Colonel [[Michael Bumgarner]], the commander of the camps during the incident and identified in Horton's article as having been present during the interrogations, denied Horton's claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harpers.org/archive/2010/01/hbc-90006395 |title=The Official Response Begins| author=Horton, Scott |work=Harpers Magazine |date=18 May 2006 |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horton wrote that Aamer's repatriation was being delayed so that he could not testify about his alleged torture in [[Bagram]] or the events on 9 June 2006. He wrote: "American authorities may be concerned that Aamer, if released, could provide evidence against them in criminal investigations."&lt;ref name=Harpers2010-01-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2010-01-18/&gt;

=== 2013 hunger strike and detention condition ===

In 2013, Aamer told his attorneys that he was among the growing group of active hunger strikers. He said he had been refusing meals since February 15 and had lost 32 pounds.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; In previous hunger strikes guards [[force-fed]] him with tubes down his nose.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; His lawyer said Aamer spent 22 hours a day alone in his cell.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; Aamer was not permitted visitors except his attorneys.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; Aamer was among a group of detainees who filed a court challenge to the authorities' practice of force feeding those on hunger strikes. A United States appellate court ruled in 2014 "that the judiciary could oversee conditions of confinement at the prison."&lt;ref name="nytOct15"/&gt;

=== 2014 motion for release ===
In 2014, his lawyers filed a motion on Aamer's behalf seeking his release on the grounds that his health is "gravely diminished,". They argued that his various health problems could not be treated in Guantanamo and "''even if he receives the intensive medical and therapeutic treatment his condition requires, Mr Aamer will take many years, if not a lifetime, to achieve any significant recovery". His lawyers argued that both the [[Geneva Convention]] and Army Regulation 190-8, require the repatriation of chronically ill prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-26933512|title=Bid to free last British resident held at Guantanamo|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/08/guantanamo-bay-british-detainee-shaker-aamer-ptsd-release|title=Guantánamo Bay: last British resident suffering from PTSD, lawyers say|author=Jon Swaine|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2014/04/last-former-english-resident-in-guantanamo-bay-requests-release-on-declining-health.php|title=JURIST - Guantanamo detainee requests release on declining health|work=jurist.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015 despite Aamer's deteriorating health, the US denied attorneys' request for an independent medical examination.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt;

==UK release negotiations==
The United Kingdom government initially refused to intervene on the behalf of Guantánamo detainees who were legal British residents but were not British [[Citizenship|citizens]].  In August 2007, Foreign Secretary [[David Miliband]] requested the release of Aamer and four other men, based on their having been granted refugee status, or similar leave, to remain in Britain as residents prior to their capture by US forces.&lt;ref name="Bbc050208"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheIndependent20070914&gt;

He also called upon jihadis to "get the hell out" of Britain, stating that civilian killings were "not allowed" in Islam, and went on to say that "you cannot just go in the street and get a knife and start stabbing people" in apparent reference to the [[murder of Lee Rigby]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/13/shaker-aamer-attacks-extremism-guantanamo-release

'''Singles' Day''' or '''''Guanggun Jie''''' ({{zh|s=光棍节|p=Guānggùn Jié|w=Kuang-kun chieh|l=Single Sticks' Holiday}}) is a holiday popular among young Chinese people&lt;ref&gt;CNN  China [http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/14/opinion/china-challenges-one-child-brooks/index.html China's biggest problem? Too many men], November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; that celebrate their pride in being single. The date, [[November 11]]th (11/11), was chosen because the number "1" resembles an individual who is alone. The holiday has also become a popular date to celebrate relationships, with over 4,000 couples being married in Beijing on this date in 2011, compared to an average of 700 a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2011/11/11/chinese-couples-rush-to-the-altar-on-111111/|title=Chinese Couples Rush to the Altar on 11/11/11|last=Chin|first=Josh|date=2011-11-11|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The holiday has become the largest [[Shopping|offline]] and [[Online shopping|online]] shopping day in the world, with [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]] shoppers exceeding 168.2 billion yuan (US$25.4 billion) in spending during the 2017 celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/12/chinese-shoppers-spend-a-record-25bn-in-singles-day-splurge|title=Chinese shoppers spend a record $25bn in Singles Day splurge|last=Haas|first=Benjamin|date=2017-11-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techinasia.com/tmall-ceo-year-alibaba-plans-singles-day-global/|title=Tmall CEO: this year, Alibaba plans to take Singles Day global|author=C.

==Origins==
{{More citations needed|date=January 2018}}

Chinese Singles' Day, or Bachelors' Day, originated at [[Nanjing University]] in 1993.  Singles' Day celebrations spread to several other universities in [[Nanjing]] during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How China’s Singles’ Day Holiday Sold Out|url=http://time.com/3576381/china-singles-day-history/|website=Times|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holiday was named "Singles' Day" because its date, 11/11 (November 11), consists of four "ones," representing four singles.

There are several theories explaining the creation of the Singles' Day festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://publicholidays.cn/singles-day/|title=Singles' Day 2017 — Public Holidays China|work=Public Holidays China|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most widely accepted theory is that the holiday grew out of Nanjing University's dorm culture. One origin story is that in 1993, four male students of Nanjing University's Mingcaowuzhu ("All single men") dorm discussed how they could break away from the monotony of being single and agreed that November 11 would be a day of events and celebrations in honor of being single.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timeoutshanghai.com/features/Blog-Shopping/48992/11-things-you-need-to-know-about-1111-Singles-Day-shopping-festival-.html|title=11 things you need to know about 11.11 Singles' Day shopping festival|last=Group|first=SEEC Media|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These activities spread through the university and eventually made their way into wider society. The spread increased with social media use, and the event has become increasingly popular within contemporary Chinese culture and society.

Singles' Day serves as an occasion for single people to meet and for parties to be organized. The holiday was initially only celebrated by young men, hence the initial name "Bachelors' Day." However, it is now widely celebrated by both sexes. "Blind date" parties are popular on this day, in an attempt to alter the single status of the participants. Some universities organize special programs to gather singles together for the celebration. Singles may take on an annoyed or self-deprecating attitude in response to remaining single as a university student, but university initiatives have helped curb that negativity.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}Although this date is meant to celebrate singlehood, the desire to find a spouse or partner is often expressed by young Chinese people on this date, while other love-related issues are discussed by the Chinese media.

==Outside China==

Singles' Day has since been popularized through the internet and is now observed at several places outside of China as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/13/alibabas-singles-day-shopping-event-in-southeast-asia-with-lazada.html|title=Singles Day is not just for China anymore|last=Saiidi|first=Uptin|date=2017-11-13|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holiday has particularly grown in Southeast Asia, with customers in the [[Lazada Group|Lazada]]'s Southeast Asian marketplaces ordering 6.5 million items in 2017. This is in part thanks to heavy promotions by the Lazada group in this region.

[[Media Markt]], a German company, promotes Singles' Day in their stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediamarkt.de/de/shop/singlesday.html|title=Der Singles Day 2018|website=MediaMarkt Onlineshop|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belgian Mediamarkt also participates, but reactions have been negative since the 11th of November is the anniversary of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]] that ended [[World War I]], and the day is associated with somber commemoration of the war dead in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20171108_03176214|title=Dit weekend vieren we een nieuwe feestdag, en die is vooral interessant voor koopjesjagers|last=jdb,sir|work=Het Nieuwsblad|access-date=2017-11-09|language=nl-BE}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Swedish electronics retailer [[Elgiganten]] promoted a Singles Day campaign in Norway before implementing it in the other [[Nordic countries]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nordic.businessinsider.com/the-worlds-biggest-shopping-fest-singles-day-that-finally-is-coming-to-the-nordics-2017-11/|title='Singles Day', the world’s biggest shopping fest, is finally coming to the Nordics|date=November 8, 2017|first=Joakim|last=Malmberg|work=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SynbiCITE''' is the UK’s national Innovation and Knowledge Centre (IKC) founded to promote the adoption and use of [[synthetic biology]] by industry.
SynbiCITE’s stated aim is to inspire innovation in synthetic biology through collaboration. It acts as a nucleating centre for new business that it can incubate in its labs and offices and also by providing business accelerator programmes to help grow businesses. These programmes include funding, training and mentoring.

== History ==
SynbiCITE was created in 2013 after a UK-wide competition between potential IKC-host universities to find the most suitable host with the best strategic plan. SynbiCITE was deemed to have shown that it had the most potential to develop and grow the UK bioeconomy with global reach through synthetic biology.
SynbiCITE is funded by government and other partners to run for five years in the first instance, with the intention that it will become self-sustaining by 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/syntheticbiologyprogress/|title=New Innovation and Knowledge Centre to drive UK's Synthetic Biology progress - EPSRC website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/news-in-brief-18-july-2013/2005752.article|title=News in brief - 18 July 2013|date=17 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 2016, SynbiCITE opened the Synthetic Biology foundry, a [[Research Councils UK]] funded facility providing remote gene design, construction and validation services using [[laboratory robotics]]. Based on a similar facility at [[MIT]], it is the first commercial facility using laboratory automation to provide on-demand services explicitly for synthetic biology in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2016/04/the-uks-first-robotic-dna-factory-has-opened-in-london/|title=The UK's First Robotic DNA Factory Has Opened in London|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/britains-first-dna-factory-opens-at-imperial-college-london-a6971451.html|title='DNA factory' opens at Imperial College London|date=6 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
SynbiCITE's aim is to accelerate science commercialisation and the emerging technologies encompassed by synthetic biology into new products, tools, processes and services, through a network of interacting partners from academia, industry and business. 

SynbiCITE also offers funding opportunities for Proof of Concept, Development of Prototype and Development of Pilot-Scale projects. It actively promotes and progresses the development of Responsible Innovation best practices throughout academia and industries that use synthetic biology.

== Governance and Management ==
SynbiCITE is headquartered at Imperial College London. Funding is from a public-private partnership between the EPSRC, BBSRC, Innovate UK, industry, academia and private investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eandt.theiet.org/news/2013/jul/synthetic-centre.cfm|title=UK’s synthetic biology industry gets £10m boost - E &amp; T Magazine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is run and managed by a Board consisting of two Co-Directors - Professor Richard Kitney and Professor Paul Freemont - with CEO Dr Stephen Chambers and Commercial &amp; Operations Director Dr John Collins.

The activities of SynbiCITE are overseen by a Steering and Advisory Board composed of independent advisors and observers from the main funding bodies.

'''Tadeusz Kwaśniak''' (born January 24, 1951 in [[Lądek-Zdrój]] - July 24, 1991 in [[Poznań]]), known as the "'''Towel Strangler'''",{{efn|name=a}} was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[pedophile]] and [[serial killer]], who raped and murdered 5 boys all over Poland between April 1990 and April 1991.
== Crimes ==
He was first reprimanded to committing lecherous acts with girls,{{efn|name=b}} spending a total of 12 years behind bars. After leaving [[Wronki Prison]], Kwaśniak began a series of thefts, rapes and murders of young boys.

The first attempted took place on April 20, 1990 in [[Bytom]] on Budryka Street. Under the pretense that he had received an envelope from the 10-year-old victim's father, Kwaśniak managed to enter the apartment. There, he began to strangle the boy with a towel, but the boy pretended to be dead. After the perpetrator left the flat, the boy informed his parents about the event.

On May 7, 1990 in [[Radom]], he robbed and then murdered a 10-year-old boy. As before, he used a towel to strangle his victim.

On May 24, 1990 in [[Wrocław]], he attempted to rob, rape and murder an 11-year-old boy. He accosted the boy on the street, and under the pretense of picking up an envelope from the victim's apartment, he managed to enter the apartment. There he explained that he was going to take revenge on his father because he got Kwaśniak fired. He raped the boy, and then began strangling him with a towel. The boy fainted, but managed to survive. The perpetrator sent a letter to the flat: "''Revenge! I waited 14 years!''"

On May 31, 1990, he carried out another murder in [[Szczecin]]. He strangled a 9-year-old boy with a towel, leaving a card next to the corpse which said: "''Revenge, finally - Z.''"

On June 6, 1990, another boy was murdered in [[Kutno]]. Kwaśniak strangled him with a towel, after which he robbed the trap. After that, he wrote 'Revenge' on the bathroom mirror with lipstick.

On June 18, 1990, he robbed and then murdered a 9-year-old on Szymanowski Street in [[Oława]]. The boy was strangled with a towel, and next to him a card with the inscription "''Finally, I made the expected revenge -B.''" was left.{{efn|name=c}}

On January 3, 1991, he made a robbery on Topolowa Street in [[Zbąszyń]]. He tricked the boy into letting him into the apartment, and then stole money, a revaluation voucher and an insurance card. Thanks to the boy, a description of the perpetrator was established, which matched the descriptions made on the basis of witness testimonies from previous acts: a man aged 30-35, well-built, a height of 1,75 cm., dark hair and carrying  a weapon.

On February 26, 1991, in [[Rataje, Poznań|Rataje]], he robbed and murdered 12-year-old boy. The boy was strangled with a towel. Witnesses who saw the man talking with the boy were quickly established, and it was possible to determine how the perpetrator dressed. The police action to catch the murderer had the code name of ''Revenge.'' On the basis of all data, in February 1991, it was possible to connect all murders to one man. The police in Poznań collected details from previous murders, and commissioned sexologist Lechosław Gapik to develop a psychological portratir of the perpetrator. The issue was publicized by the "997" publivision program, which reconstructed the murders and gave the perpetrator a [[modus operandi]] and portrait. Thanks to these actions, it was established that the perpetrator had accosted boys in Rataje for a few days, with whose help a [[facial composite]] was made and published on the media, as well as at bus stops and in taxis. For any help in catching the perpetrator, the Provinicial Police Chief of Poznań set a prize of 5,000,000 [[Polish złoty]].

Despite this, on March 7, 1991 in Wrocław, Kwaśniak raped another boy. Under the pretext of giving the parents of the boy a letter from his aunt who lived abroad, he managed to enter the apartment.

On April 18, 1991, he attacked once again [[Sosnowiec]], but his victim managed to survive.
== Arrest ==
On April 22, 1991, the police in Poznań received a signal from the headmaster of Primary School No. 6 on the Rusa Housing Estate about students who were being accosted by a suspicious man. Later, the same application was made by a woman who, during a walk around the estate, noticed that same strange man. As a result of this, the man was soon detained on one of the residential streets.

During the interrogation, the man, who turned out to be Kwaśniak, admitted to the murders in Oława, Kutno, Szczecin, Radom and Poznań, to the attempted murders in Bytom and in Wrocław, and to the rape in Sosnowiec. He also admitted to several dozen apartment thefts, including in [[Słupsk]], [[Białystok]], [[Lublin]], [[Kraków]], [[Częstochowa]], [[Bydgoszcz]], Szczecin and [[Wejherowo]].
== Death ==
On July 24, 1991, Kwaśniak committed suicide in his prison cell, hanging himself with a bandage. In connection with his death, the investigation was discontinued. He was buried at the Miłostowo cemetery on August 1, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poznan.pl/mim/necropolis/plan.html?id=37333&amp;name=Tadeusz&amp;cm_id=1&amp;urlAnchor=OpenMap&amp;surname=Kwa%C5%9Bniak The cemetery search engine - Poznań]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Grey Zone''''' is a 2001 American [[war film]] directed by [[Tim Blake Nelson]] and starring [[David Arquette]], [[Steve Buscemi]], [[Harvey Keitel]], [[Mira Sorvino]], and [[Daniel Benzali]]. It is based on the book ''Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account'' written by Dr. [[Miklós Nyiszli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account|author=Nyiszli, Miklós |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc.|isbn=9781611450118|date=April 1, 2011 |edition=Overdrive Read epub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title comes from a chapter in the book ''[[The Drowned and the Saved]]'' by [[Holocaust]] survivor [[Primo Levi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Drowned and the Saved|author=Levi, Primo|publisher 	=Einaudi (Italian 1986), Summit Books (English 1988)|isbn=0-349-10047-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film tells the story of the [[Jewish]] ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' XII in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz death camp]] in October 1944. These prisoners were made to assist the camp's guards in shepherding their victims to the [[gas chamber]]s and then disposing of their bodies in the ovens.

==Plot==
The film opens in October 1944, in the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] [[extermination camp]]. A small group of [[Sonderkommandos]], prisoners assigned to dispose of the bodies of other dead prisoners, are plotting an [[insurrection]] that, they hope, will destroy at least one of the camp's four [[crematoria]] and gas chambers. They are receiving firearms from [[Polish people|Polish]] citizens in the nearby village and gunpowder from the UNIO munitions factory; the female prisoners who work in the UNIO are smuggling the powder to the men’s camp amid the bodies of their dead workers. When the women's activity is eventually discovered by the Germans they are savagely [[torture]]d, but they don't reveal the plot.

Meanwhile, a [[Hungarian Jews|Hungarian-Jewish]] doctor, Miklós Nyiszli ([[Allan Corduner]]), who works for the [[Nazi]] scientist [[Josef Mengele]] in an experimental medical lab, has received permission from Mengele himself to visit his wife and daughter in the women’s [[labor camp]]. Nyiszli is concerned about the safety of his family and believes that Mengele’s orders will keep them from the gas chambers.

A new trainload of [[Hungary|Hungarian]] Jewish prisoners arrives, and all are immediately sent to the gas chambers. As the group is given instructions about "delousing", a fearful, angry man in the group begins shouting questions at one of the Sonderkommandos, Hoffman (Arquette), who has been issuing the instructions. Hoffman beats him to death in an outburst of frustration, in an attempt to make the man stop talking. After the gassing of this same group, a badly shaken Hoffman finds a young girl alive beneath a pile of bodies. He removes her from the chamber, and, after informing the leader of the insurgency, Schlermer ([[Daniel Benzali]]), takes her to a storage room and summons Nyiszli, who revives her. The group decides to hide her in the children’s camp. While the prisoners hide her in a dressing room, [[SS]]-''[[Oberscharführer]]'' [[Eric Muhsfeldt]] (Keitel) suddenly walks in. Noticing that one of the prisoners present, Abramowics (Buscemi), is there illegally, he shoots him, prompting the girl to scream and to be discovered. Nyiszli then takes Muhsfeldt outside and tells him about the uprising, but cannot tell him where or when it will begin. Muhsfeldt agrees to protect the young girl after the uprising is suppressed.

The insurrection begins, and Crematorium IV is destroyed with the smuggled explosives. All the Sonderkommandos who survive the explosions and gunfights with the SS are captured. They are held until the fire in the crematorium is extinguished, after which they are executed. Hoffmann and a fellow prisoner, Rosenthal (David Chandler), conclude that the girl will not be set free after she is forced to watch the executions. After all captives are shot, the girl is allowed to flee toward the main gate of the camp. Before she can run very far, Muhsfeldt draws his handgun and shoots her. The film closes with a voice-over recitation by the dead girl.

'''''The Transcendental Temptation: A Critique of Religion and the Paranormal''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Paul Kurtz]]. The book was published by [[Prometheus Books]] in 1986, a company founded by Kurtz in 1969, but which has published numerous book on skepticism and secular humanism by many authors.

==Summary==
Kurtz analyzes the bases of religion: how provable are the claims of the famous prophets who founded religion in their name: [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]], [[Moses]], [[Muhammad]], [[Joseph Smith]], [[Ellen G. White]] and others? He asks what the prospects are for developing a humanistic society based on scientific and humane foundations.

==Reception==
In the award of the Norton Medal (endowed by [[Charles Phelps Norton]]) to Kurtz in 2001, ''The Transcendental Temptation'' was noted, amongst Kurtz's other contributions to secular humanism, as a seminal work on the topic. The award also noted Kurtz's founding of the [[Center for Inquiry]].{{fact|date=March 2017}}

==Implants==
Cannon has had a variety of body modification implants, including a [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) tag in his hand and [[magnetic implant]]s in a finger, wrist, and [[tragus (ear)|tragus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xavier|title=Biohacking, the Body Modification that Turns You into a Cyborg|url=https://www.tattoodo.com/a/2016/10/biohacking-the-body-modification-that-turns-you-into-a-cyborg/|website=TattooDo|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing him to be labelled a [[cyborg]] by media outlets including ''[[Business Insider]]'',&lt;ref name="businessinsider"/&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'',&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2014/08/08/cyborgs-are-walking-among-us-262132.html |first= Michael|last= Carroll|date=July 31, 2014|title=Part Human, Part Machine, Cyborgs Are Becoming A Reality |publisher=Newsweek.com |accessdate=2015-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Awl]]'',&lt;ref name="Ferguson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theawl.com/2013/12/the-future-of-biohacking-in-the-age-of-patent-trolls|first=Cat |last=Ferguson|title=The Future Of Biohacking In The Age Of Patent Trolls|work=Theawl.com|date=Dec 12, 2013|accessdate=2015-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. Because of legal and ethical restrictions on the types of surgery that can be done on humans, most of these modifications cannot be done by doctors or anesthetists.  Instead they are done by body modification experts or on a "DIY" basis.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt;

In May 2012, inspired by Lepht Anonym, Cannon had finger magnets implanted to give him an "extra sense", the ability to feel [[electromagnetism]].&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-09/04/diy-biohacking|title=Magnet-implanting DIY biohackers pave the way for mainstream adoption (Wired UK)|publisher=wired.co.uk|accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Czuba|first1=Killian|title=Fast Forward|journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=2|issue=4|pages=44-45|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/fast-forward|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, Cannon became the first person to be implanted with the Grindhouse-designed biometric sensor known as Circadia, a procedure which was performed by body modification artist [[Steve Haworth]] in [[Essen, Germany]].&lt;ref name="Lallanilla"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lallanilla|first1=Marc|title='Biohacker' Implants Chip in Arm|url=https://www.livescience.com/40892-biohacker-tim-cannon-cyborg.html|accessdate=18 July 2017|work=Live Science|date=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="businessinsider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/cyborg-people-who-implanted-tech-2014-8?op=1|title=Cyborg People Who Implanted Tech - Business Insider|publisher=Businessinsider.com|accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aljazeera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/18/the-brave-new-worldofbiohacking.html|title=The brave new world of biohacking &amp;#124; Al Jazeera America|publisher=America.aljazeera.com|accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device, approximately the size of a deck of [[playing cards]], automatically sent Cannon's temperature to his phone, was powered wirelessly through inductive charging, and mimicked bioluminescence with subdermal [[LEDs]].&lt;ref name="makezine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://makezine.com/magazine/make-43/underware-subdermal-devices/|title=Under Your Skin: Wearables Meet DIY Body Mods - Make: &amp;#124; Make:|publisher=Makezine.com|accessdate=2015-04-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414200949/http://makezine.com/magazine/make-43/underware-subdermal-devices/|archivedate=2015-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/40892-biohacker-tim-cannon-cyborg.html|title='Biohacker' Implants Chip in Arm|work=LiveScience.com|accessdate=2015-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a few months as an initial proof-of-concept test, which was declared a success, the device was removed.&lt;ref name="Wainwright"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wainwright|first1=Oliver|title=Body-hackers: the people who turn themselves into cyborgs|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/aug/14/body-hackers-the-people-who-turn-themselves-into-cyborgs|accessdate=18 July 2017|work=The Guardian|date=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cannon is currently working to design an improved, consumer-friendly version of his Circadia implant that measures additional biometrics such as blood glucose, blood oxygen, blood pressure, and heart rate data.&lt;ref name="wareable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wareable.com/wearable-tech/meet-the-grinders-implantables|title=Meet the grinders: The humans using tech to live forever|publisher=Wareable.com|accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Tim had a prototype of Grindhouse’s Northstar device implanted into his right forearm during a procedure at the “Cyborg Fair” in [[Düsseldorf, Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/biohackers-are-implanting-led-lights-under-their-skin/|title=Biohackers are Implanting LED Lights Under their Skin|website=Motherboard|accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A little larger than a coin, Northstar contained five LED lights, creating a bioluminescent effect when touched with a magnet (such as the ones implanted in Cannon's fingertips.)&lt;ref name="Guler"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4190">The '''World Organisation Against Torture''' (''Organisation Mondiale Contre la Torture''; '''OMCT''') is the world’s largest coalition of non-governmental organisations fighting against [[arbitrary detention]], [[torture]], [[summary execution|summary]] and [[extrajudicial execution]]s, [[forced disappearance]]s and other forms of [[violence]]. The global network consists of almost 300 local, national and regional organisations, which share the goal of eradicating torture and fostering respect of [[human rights]] for all.

The OMCT's ''Prevention of Torture'' programme helps its members prevent and report torture by strengthening their capacity through the SOS-Torture network to use [[United Nations]] [[human rights]] mechanisms. The programme submits alternative reports to UN Committees in collaboration with local [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, provides support for individuals and organisations wishing to challenge torture practices in international legal fora and publishes a practical guide on international and regional conventional mechanisms relevant to torture. OMCT is also [[Gender mainstreaming|mainstreaming]] women’s and children’s issues into the UN human rights mechanisms.

On 4 October 2007, former [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] became the new president of the OMCT Supporting Foundation.[http://www.omct.org/index.php?id=&amp;lang=eng&amp;actualPageNumber=1&amp;articleId=7286&amp;itemAdmin=article&amp;PHPSESSID=9d4fce0157f23ed08fa9ee8354df5124]

==Activities==
OMCT contributes to UN activities through three main activities.
===Reporting===
OMCT submits alternative reports to the UN [[United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture|Committee Against Torture]] (CAT), the [[Human Rights Committee]] (HRC) and the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC), working with local NGOs. 
Reporting activities are designed to encourage national NGOs to report torture and follow up reports of torture through:
*the participation of local NGOs in drafting alternative reports and actively including them in relevant Committees’ sessions, with the possibility of a follow-up meeting in the field;
*an integrated approach to questions relating to protection from torture and other ill-treatment of women and children, by involving organisations specialised in these issues in drafting alternative reports and in relevant Committees’ sessions;
*greater dissemination of reports and of the Conclusions and Recommendations of the Committees in English and in the preferred language of the relevant country, through the publication of the reports that have been submitted.

===Legal support===
OMCT supports individuals and organisations wishing to challenge torture practices in international legal forums. Complaint mechanisms can be used to achieve a number of different objectives including: 
*protection for victims or persons under threat; 
*obtaining [[reparation (legal)|reparations]] and [[Damages|compensation]] for victims; 
*putting pressure on governments to end [[impunity]] in specific cases; and 
*achieving changes in legislation and State practice which lead to serious human rights violations. 
Many NGOs are not fully aware of how to use UN procedures to support their work in protecting victims from torture. OMCT hopes to encourage and assist partner NGOs that are already active in the struggle against torture to present individual complaints and other relevant information to the CAT, the HRC, and the [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW).
===Practical guidance===
OMCT publishes a practical guide on international and regional conventional mechanisms relevant to torture. This Handbook is conceived as a tool for action. It addresses the practical needs of anybody using international mechanisms and bodies to challenge torture practices.
