'''AMSAT-OSCAR 7''', or '''AO-7''', is the second Phase 2 [[amateur radio satellite]] constructed by the Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation or [[AMSAT]]. It was launched into [[Low Earth Orbit]] on November 15, 1974 and remained operational until a battery failure in 1981. Then after 21 years of apparent silence, the satellite was heard again on June 21, 2002 – 27 years after launch. At that time the public learned that the satellite had remained intermittently functional and used surreptitiously for communication by the anticommunist opposition [[Fighting Solidarity]] during the [[martial law in Poland]].&lt;ref name="oscar-solidarity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nowahistoria.interia.pl/prl/news-jak-solidarnosc-walczaca-wykorzystala-satelite-do-zbudowania,nId,1734550|title=Jak Solidarność Walcząca wykorzystała satelitę do zbudowania systemu łączności|website=[[interia.pl|nowahistoria.interia.pl]]|first=Andrzej|last=Kołodziej|date=2015-05-15|accessdate=2017-04-28|language=pl|trans-title= How Fighting Solidarity used a satellite to build a communication system}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AO-7 is the oldest amateur satellite still in use, and is one of the oldest operational [[communications satellites]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}  It carries two amateur radio [[transponder (satellite communications)|transponders]].  Its "Mode A" transponder has an uplink on the [[2-meter band]] and a downlink on the [[10-meter band]]. The "Mode B" transponder has an uplink on the [[70-centimeter band]] and a downlink on the 2-meter band.  The satellite also carries four [[Electric beacon|beacon]]s which are designed to operate on the 10-meter, 2-meter, 70-centimeter and [[13-centimeter band]]s.  The 13-cm beacon was never activated due to a change in international treaties.&lt;ref name="arrl-2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.arrl.org/news/stories/2002/06/24/101/ |title=ARRLWeb: It's Aliiiiive!

AMSAT reported AO-7 still operational on June 25, 2015, with reliable power only from its solar panels; the report stated the cause of the 21-year outage was a [[short circuit]] in the battery and the restoration of service was due to its becoming an open circuit. The satellite eclipses on every orbit during the northern summer and autumn; the rest of the year it is in continuous sunlight and alternates between transmission modes A and B. All transponders and beacons are operational.&lt;ref name="amsat-summary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/satellites/satInfo.php?satID=9|title=AMSAT - Satellite Detail - AMSAT-OSCAR 7|date=6 April 2006|accessdate=1 March 2008|publisher=AMSAT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Build==
AO-7 was the second Phase 2 satellite (Phase II-B). At launch, the satellite had a mass of {{convert|28.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and it was placed into a 1444 x 1459&amp;nbsp;km orbit. It is shaped as an [[octahedron]] 360&amp;nbsp;mm high and 424&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.  It has a circularly-polarized, canted turnstile VHF/UHF antenna system and HF dipole. Four radio masts mounted at 90 degree intervals on the base of the satellite and two experimental repeater systems provided store-and-forward for [[Morse code]] and [[teletype]] messages ("codestore") as it orbited around the world. The Mode-B transponder was designed and build by Karl Meinzer, DJ4ZC and Werner Haas, DJ5KQ. The Mode-B transponder was the first using “HELAPS” (High Efficient Linear Amplification by Parametric Synthesis) technology was developed by Dr. Karl Meinzer as part of his [[Ph.D.]] research.  AO-7 has redundant command decoders of a design similar to the unit proven highly successful in [[AMSAT-OSCAR 6]]. The decoder has provisions for 35 separate functions, and is designed to provide a reliable means of controlling the emissions of the repeaters, beacons and other experiments aboard the spacecraft.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

AO-7 demonstrated several uses of new technologies and operations &lt;ref name="AO-7 Satellite Summary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/satellites/sat_summary/ao7.php|title=AMSAT-OSCAR 7 Satellite Summary|date=31 May 2003|accessdate=16 December 2009|publisher=AMSAT| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091221081422/http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/satellites/sat_summary/ao7.php| archivedate= 21 December 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AO-6 AO-7.jpg|thumb|left|caption|190px|constellation allowing intersatellite communication from the United States with AMSAT-OSCAR 6 and AMSAT-OSCAR 7.]]
The uplink frequency predates the [[World Administrative Radio Conference|WARC]] 1979 allocation of 435-438&amp;nbsp;MHz by the [[ITU]] for the Amateur Satellite Service which places the uplink in the [[70cm]] weak signal segment. Additionally, the [[International Amateur Radio Union|IARU]] bandplan has the 432.1&amp;nbsp;MHz range (which is used for mode B uplink) marked for "weak signal" in all three Regions. Accessing the Mode B uplink is permitted in the United States under a waiver from the FCC.&lt;ref&gt;http://ww2.amsat.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FCC_AO7_waiver-19740419.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use by Polish anticommunist opposition==
In the summer of 1982 the Fighting Solidarity in [[Wrocław]] learned that AO-7 became periodically functional, when its solar panels got enough sunlight to power up the satellite. It was then used to communicate with [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] activists in other Polish cities and to send messages to the West. Satellite communication was invaluable at that time, as the regular telephone network was tapped by the government and shut down when martial law was imposed in December 1981. [[Ham radios]] were not of much use as they were easy to track. On the other hand, a satellite link required highly directional antennas which were impossible to track by the regime. In 2002 Pat Gowen (G3IOR), inspired by the history of Fighting Solidarity, attempted to communicate with AO-7 and confirmed it to be operational.&lt;ref name="oscar-solidarity"/&gt;

==Current status==
{{As of|2017|October}}, contacts with AO-7 are reported daily.&lt;ref name="oscar-amsat-org"&gt;

The mineral was discovered after samples of the polymorph [[sweetite]] were sent to labs by S. A. Rust. Some specimens contained what appeared to be [[baryte]] but, which on further examination, were found to be a previously undescribed mineral.

The '''Center for Climate Systems Research''' is a key [[Columbia University]] [[Earth Institute]] center with over 25 scientists and staff researching issues involving the interplay between Earth's climate and society. The center's motto is ''Columbia's Gateway to [[NASA]] and Beyond'', as it has a special relationship with the NASA [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]] (GISS). It is a ''Gateway to NASA'', because the center is co-located with GISS in Columbia University's Armstrong Hall above [[Tom's Restaurant]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.giss.nasa.gov/about/ | title = About GISS | publisher = NASA | date =2017 | access-date =July 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this historic location, Columbia and NASA scientists work together closely to understand the Earth's climate and how changes can impact society both in the United States and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://ccsr.columbia.edu/ | title =Center for Climate Systems Research | publisher = Columbia University | date =2017 | access-date =July 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, CCSR scientists also work with many other partners – governmental, private sector, and non-governmental organizations – to answer these challenging scientific and socioeconomic questions (i.e., ''and Beyond''). Since late 2017, the director of CCSR has been Dr. Michael J. Puma.

The '''Coombabah Lake Conservation Park''' is a [[nature reserve|conservation park]] that is an [[A Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia|Important Wetland in Australia]], located in the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] region of [[South East Queensland]], [[Australia]]. Part of the [[Coomera River]] [[drainage basin|catchment]], Lake Coombabah is a tidal [[lake]] at the [[mouth (river)|mouth]] of Coombabah Creek. The Coombabah wetlands are significant because they are the most southerly lake and coastal swampland representatives in the bioregion, and because the area provides significant wildlife value and refuge habitat.&lt;ref name=DOIW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/wetlands/report.pl?smode=DOIW&amp;doiw_refcodelist=QLD194|title=Lake Coombabah - QLD194|work=Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia - Information sheet|publisher=[[Department of the Environment (Australia)|Department of the Environment]], [[Australian Government]]|date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=27 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservation area includes tidal marshlands and mangroves along part of the lakes edge. The Melaleuca boardwalk allows viewing of the wildlife. The mangroves are home to frogs, crabs and fish that attract native and migratory birds. There are  guided bushwalking and canoeing activities as part of community conservation and environmental workshops to promote local conservation.&lt;ref name=GCCC/&gt;

==Location and features==
Situated near the suburb of {{QLDcity|Coombabah}}, {{convert|5|km}} from the coast and {{convert|8|km}} northwest of {{QLDcity|Southport}}, the lake borders the Ivan Gibbs Wetland Reserve, is classified as a Fish Habitat Area within the [[Moreton Bay Marine Park]] and serves as an important wildlife corridor between the Nerang State Forest and the coast.&lt;ref name=GCCC&gt;{{cite web|title=Coombabah Lakes Conservation Area|url=http://www.gcparks.com.au/park-details.aspx?park=175|work=Tourism: Parks|publisher=[[Gold Coast City Council]]|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lake is fed by Coombabah Creek which rises to the west in the Nerang Forest Reserve.  The Ivan Gibbs Wetlands Reserve and Lakeside Country Club golf course are both located to the south of the lake.  Houses in [[Helensvale, Queensland|Helensvale]] have been built a short distance from the lake's western shore.

{{wiktionary|crystallinity|crystalline}}
'''Crystallinity''' refers to the degree of structural order in a [[solid]]. In a [[crystal]], the atoms or molecules are arranged in a regular, periodic manner. The degree of crystallinity has a big influence on [[hardness]], [[density]], [[Transparency and translucency|transparency]] and [[diffusion]]. In a gas, the relative positions of the atoms or molecules are completely random. Amorphous materials, such as [[liquids]] and [[glass]]es, represent an intermediate case, having order over short distances (a few atomic or molecular spacings) but not over longer distances.

Many materials, such as [[glass-ceramic]]s and some [[polymer]]s, can be prepared in such a way as to produce a mixture of crystalline and [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]] regions. In such cases, crystallinity is usually specified as a percentage of the volume of the material that is crystalline. Even within materials that are completely crystalline, however, the degree of structural perfection can vary. For instance, most metallic [[alloy]]s are crystalline, but they usually comprise many independent crystalline regions (grains or [[crystallite]]s) in various orientations separated by [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]]; furthermore, they contain other [[crystallographic defect]]s (notably [[dislocation]]s) that reduce the degree of structural perfection. The most highly perfect crystals are silicon [[Boule (crystal)|boules]] produced for semiconductor electronics; these are large [[single crystal]]s (so they have no grain boundaries), are nearly free of dislocations, and have precisely controlled concentrations of defect atoms.

Crystallinity can be measured using [[x-ray crystallography]], but calorimetric techniques are also commonly used.

== Rock crystallinity ==
Geologists describe four qualitative levels of crystallinity:
* holocrystalline rocks are completely crystalline;
* hypocrystalline rocks are partially crystalline, with crystals embedded in an amorphous or glassy matrix;
* hypohyaline rocks are partially glassy;
* holohyaline rocks (such as [[obsidian]]) are completely glassy.

The '''current solar income''' of the [[Earth]], or an [[ecozone]] or [[ecoregion]] or any area, is the amount of [[solar energy]] that falls on it as sunlight.  This is thought important in some branches of [[green economics]], as the ultimate measure of [[renewable energy]].  

[[Buckminster Fuller]] first described the concept in his 1970 paper ''[[Cosmic Costing]]'', contrasting the [[photosynthesis]] on which [[natural capital]] and [[sustainability|sustainable]] [[infrastructural capital]] depend, with the [[chemosynthesis]] of extracting and using [[fossil fuel]]s.

[[Paul Hawken]] is a more recent advocate of the concept, and views it as central to his notion of a [[restorative economy]].  It remains a popular notion among those who believe that [[toxic waste]] and maintenance problems of direct [[solar energy]] devices can ultimately be overcome, or that yields of passive or biological means of gathering and using this energy as [[biofuel]]s can be made to approximate those of fossil fuels.

===Social, economic, and demographic diversity===
According to the World Development Report published by the World Bank in 2012, Africa’s economy is about the size of the Netherlands' economy, which is equivalent to only approximately six percent of the U.S. economy.&lt;ref name=WDR /&gt; Akin Iwayemi, a professor at University of Ibadan in Nigeria, suggests that there is potentially a “strong feedback relationship between the energy sector and the national economy.”&lt;ref name=Iwayemi /&gt; Determining socio-economic indicators in Africa include population, population density, land area, proportion of citizens living in an urban setting, and Gross Domestic Product (GNP) per capita.&lt;ref name=Iwayemi /&gt;

Overall, the African continent is a net energy exporter. In 2009 the net energy export was 40% of the energy production 13,177 TWh.&lt;ref name=IEA2010&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2010] Page: Country specific indicator numbers from page 48&lt;/ref&gt; The world share of energy production in Africa was 12% of oil and 7% of gas in 2009.&lt;ref name=TI2011&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/content/download/59374/951162/TI_PRT_2011_report_FINAL_EN.pdf  ''2011 Report on oil and gas companies, Promoting revenue transparency''] [[Transparency International]] 2011 p. 115, 117&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current energy usage in Africa===
{{Update|section|date=March 2015}}
Energy in Africa is a scarcer commodity than in the developed world – annual consumption is 518 KWh in Sub-Saharan Africa, the same amount of electricity used by an individual in an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD – example is the U.S.) country in 25 days.&lt;ref name=Cook /&gt; More than 500 million people live without electricity. Across the continent only 10% of individuals have access to the electrical grid, and of those, 75% come from the richest two quintiles in overall income.&lt;ref name=Power /&gt; Less than 2% of the rural populations of Malawi, Ethiopia, Niger, and Chad have access to electrical power.&lt;ref name=Cook /&gt; Electrical provisioning in Africa has generally only reached wealthy, urban middle class, and commercial sectors, bypassing the region’s large rural populations and urban poor.&lt;ref name=Cook /&gt; According to the forum of Energy Ministers of Africa, most agriculture still relies primarily on humans and animals for energy input.&lt;ref name=Forum /&gt; The electrical industry in Africa faces the economic paradox that raising prices will prohibit access to their services, but that they cannot afford to roll out additional infrastructure to drive prices down and increase access without additional capital.&lt;ref name=Cook /&gt;

Overall rates of access to energy in Africa have held constant since the 1980s, while the rest of the developing world has seen electrical grid distribution increase by 20%.&lt;ref name=Power /&gt; Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region in the world where per-capita access rates are falling.&lt;ref name=Davidson /&gt; According to recent trends, over 60% of Sub-Saharan Africans will still lack access to electricity by 2020.&lt;ref name=Cook /&gt;

Moreover, Africa has an average electrification rate of 24%, while the rate in the rest of the developing world lies closer to 40%.&lt;ref name=Cook /&gt; Even in the areas covered by the electrical grid, power is often unreliable: the manufacturing sector loses power on average 56 days out of the year.&lt;ref name=Power /&gt; In Senegal power is out 25 days a year, in Tanzania 63 days, and in Burundi 144 days.&lt;ref name=Cook /&gt; Frequent power outages cause damage to sales, equipment, and discourage international investment.&lt;ref name=Davidson /&gt; According to the periodical African Business, “Poor transport links and irregular power supplies have stunted the growth of domestic companies and discouraged foreign firms from setting up manufacturing plants in the continent."&lt;ref name=Cook /&gt;

Despite its unreliability, electrical service in Sub-Saharan Africa also costs more than in other parts of the world. The protective tariff required in Sub-Saharan Africa is $0.13 USD, compared to $0.04–0.08 USD in the rest of the developing world. Additionally, one of the greatest challenges in an effort to create sustainable development in Africa is that many countries with exportable resources are land-locked without a system of transportation.&lt;ref name=Iwayemi /&gt;

Although Africa lacks a sufficient transport system, new developments in industry and manufacturing have resulted in tremendous population growth, increased urbanization, high energy consumption, over-cultivation of lands, and significant industrial advancements engendered by globalization.&lt;ref name=Africa /&gt; Professor Iwayemi of University of Ibadan in Nigeria states that the “fundamental energy question facing Africa [is]…providing and maintaining widespread access of the population to reliable and affordable supplies of environmentally cleaner energy to meet the requirements of rapid economic growth and improved living standards.”&lt;ref name=Iwayemi /&gt; In correspondence to The Africa Society, the population growth of sub-Saharan Africa is 2.2% annually; therefore, by 2025, it is estimated that Africa will consist of over a billion people.&lt;ref name=Africa /&gt; If this mathematical model is correct environmental problems could double or even triple by 2025.&lt;ref name=Africa /&gt;

Perhaps a confounding variable of these trends is that less than 1% of the electricity generated in the Africa originates from renewable resources, as the ''White Paper on Energy Policy'' proclaims.&lt;ref name=DME /&gt; The main objectives of the paper were to “increase access to affordable energy services, improve energy governance, stimulate economic growth, manage energy-related environmental impacts, and ensure security of supply through diversification.”&lt;ref name=Nyabadza /&gt;&lt;ref name=El-Sheykhi /&gt;

===Africa's environmental potential===

The African continent features many sustainable energy resources, of which only a small percentage have been harnessed. 5–7% of the continent’s hydroelectric potential has been tapped, and only 0.6% of its geothermal.&lt;ref name=ADI /&gt; The publication ''Energy Economics'' estimates that replacing South African coal power with hydroelectric imported from the Democratic Republic of the Congo could save 40 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually.&lt;ref name=Bhat /&gt; 2011 estimates place African geothermal capacity at 14,000 MW, of which only 60 MW has been tapped.&lt;ref name=Bhat /&gt; The African Energy Policy Research Network calculates that biomass from agricultural waste alone could meet the present electrical needs of 16 south eastern countries with bagasse-based cogeneration.&lt;ref name=Bhat /&gt; The sugar industry in Mauritius already provides 25% of the country’s energy from byproduct cogeneration, with the potential for up to 13 times that amount with a widespread rollout cogeneration technology and process optimization.&lt;ref name=ADI /&gt;

According to Stephen Karekezi, Director of African Energy Policy Research Network and co-worker Waeni Kithyoma, Africa is third largest in crude oil reserves (behind the Middle East and Latin America), third largest in natural gas resources (behind the Middle East and Europe), second greatest for uranium (behind Australia), and is plentiful in hydro energy potentials and other renewable energy, such as bio-energy and solar energy.&lt;ref name=Karekezi /&gt; Professor Iwayemi states that there are conventional energy sources in Africa: hydroelectric and wood fuels, coal lignite, crude oil, natural gas and nuclear fuels, and there are unconventional energy sources, such as solar, geothermal, biomass, oil and tar sands, wind energy and tidal energy from the influence of the sea.&lt;ref name=Iwayemi /&gt;

In addition, South Africa alone obtains the sixth largest coal reserves on the planet, after China, the US, India, Russia and Australia.&lt;ref name=Winkler /&gt; Specific renewable resources in South Africa include solar, wind, hydropower, wave energy, and bio-energy.&lt;ref name=El-Sheykhi /&gt;&lt;ref name=RSA /&gt;

===Human capabilities of energy in Africa===

Professor Iwayemi suggests that “commercial energy use remains a key factor in human development.”&lt;ref name=Iwayemi /&gt; Commercial energy can include solar powered systems and the like.

In addition, The Africa Society admits that much of Africa’s apparent facilitation of poverty is the result of degradation of agriculture and arable lands, as well as, the mismanagement of water resources.&lt;ref name=Africa /&gt; A large contributing factor to these events and others, such as famine, is deforestation.&lt;ref name=Africa /&gt; Clean energy potentiality in Africa could therefore reduce environmental degradation, and consequently, poverty.&lt;ref name=Africa /&gt;

To provide an example, implementation of biodiesel technology has potential for the creation of jobs, as well as consequent economic development in disadvantaged rural communities.&lt;ref name=Visagie /&gt; This form of clean energy also enables energy security for many nations throughout the globe including those in Africa, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions rather significantly.&lt;ref name=Visagie /&gt;

====The Capabilities Approach====

Sen, an Indian economist, has assimilated a concept referred to as "The Capabilities Approach," in which he suggests that “poverty can be sensibly identified in terms of capability deprivation.”&lt;ref name=Sen /&gt; Further, he states that “relative deprivation in terms of incomes can yield absolute deprivation in terms of capabilities.”&lt;ref name=Sen /&gt; He believes that the freedom to achieve well-being is of great importance, and can lead to increased capabilities.&lt;ref name=Sen /&gt; Energy could facilitate a great deal of freedom, for individuals could gain access to a wide variety of resources.&lt;ref name=Sen /&gt;

===Challenges facing energy in Africa===

The high upfront capital cost of many resources, particularly renewable resources, is one of the most critical barriers to the development of an energy market.&lt;ref name=Visagie /&gt; Other challenges include the lack of food security and limited water resources, for these factors are necessary for life and therefore take priority over energy initiation.&lt;ref name=Visagie /&gt;

==Energy utilization and availability==

===North Africa===
North Africa is dominant in oil and in gas, for Libya obtains approximately 50% of the oil reserves available in Africa.&lt;ref name=Iwayemi /&gt; Libya designated USD $5 billion to assert programs and regulations that will reduce carbon emissions.&lt;ref name=Holliday /&gt; Resources, such as oil and gas, are also prevalent in Algeria, in addition to natural gas.&lt;ref name=Iwayemi /&gt; According to the Renewable Energy Sector in N. Africa, solar capacity is also extremely relevant in North Africa.&lt;ref name=Renewable /&gt; The total power installed in North Africa region was roughly 61.6 GW in 2012. This is mostly made up of hydro accounting for nearly 10%.

===Southern Africa===
[[File:Sub-Saharan Africa electricity generation mix (2005-2015) (30010633237).png|thumb|Energy sources in sub-Saharan Africa. Fossil Fuels and hydroelectric power make up the largest share of sub-Saharan African electricity.]]
Southern Africa has 91 percent of all of Africa’s coal reserves and 70% of the nuclear/uranium resources in Africa, according to Professor Iwayemi.&lt;ref name=Iwayemi /&gt; Southern Africa follows Central Africa closely in hydro resources; hydroelectric potential can particularly be found in the Congo DRC, Mozambique, Zambia, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Nigeria.&lt;ref name=Iwayemi /&gt; Mozambique in particular has joined an international initiative to develop an energy action plan, to contribute to ''Sustainable Energy for All''.&lt;ref name=Holliday /&gt;

In accordance with The Africa Society, USAID’s Living in the Finite Environment program has helped form 15 protected areas in Southern Africa, encompassing nearly 40,000 community members, known as conservancies in Namibia.&lt;ref name=Africa /&gt;

The country of South Africa alone obtains the sixth largest coal reserves on the planet, after China, the US, India, Russia and Australia. Specific renewable resources in South Africa include solar, wind, hydro power, wave energy, and bio-energy.

{{As of|2017}}, Zambia is in a massive power crisis that began in June. In Lusaka the eight-hour blackouts cause families to cook on a simple charcoal fire. The reason for this is poor rainfall, causing less hydroelectric output.

===East Africa===
The Africa Society portrays that promotion of sustainable use of natural resources is occurring in Kenya and in Uganda; Kenya and Uganda are “improving community-based wildlife management, strengthening forestry and environmental management, and enhancing integrated coastal zone management…[this] reduces conflicts between communities and protected areas by promoting access rights, revenue sharing…,” etc.&lt;ref name=Africa /&gt; Kenya also organized an instrumental energy plan to support development and economic growth.&lt;ref name=Holliday /&gt;

In Tanzania, the goal is to conserve biodiversity.&lt;ref name=Africa /&gt; “The USAID supports local actions in the Pangani, Bagamoyo, and Mkuranga districts that promote sustainable coastal and marine resources management through co-management for near-shore fishery areas, small-scale enterprise development, marine culture, and coastal tourism.”&lt;ref name=Africa /&gt; There is also an essential push for geothermal power in East Africa, given the arid climate.&lt;ref name=Holliday /&gt;

Norway also supports the replacement of kerosene lamps with alternatives facilitated from [[solar power in Kenya]], access to energy in Ethiopia’s rural areas for job growth and a better standard of living, and Liberia’s implementation of a climate plan.&lt;ref name=Holliday /&gt;

===West Africa===
Electricity access in Ghana increased 500% between 1991 and 2000, but per capita consumption actually fell over the same period, suggesting electricity usage was unaffordable. Ghana was also one of the primary countries to develop an energy action plan, in response to the initiative for Sustainable Energy for All.&lt;ref name=Holliday/&gt;

Nigeria is currently a dumping ground for electronic products, which leach toxic metals and substances such as lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, antimony, and trioxide into water sources.&lt;ref name=Africa /&gt; When burned, carcinogenic dioxins and polyaromatic hydrocarbons are emitted and toxic chemicals like barium are transmitted into the soil.&lt;ref name=Africa /&gt; The 1989 Basel Convention established an international treaty designed to regulate hazardous waste from being dumped into the developing world.&lt;ref name=Africa /&gt;

In reflection of statements made in Prof. Iwayemi’s essay, West Africa does have some coal reserves – approximately 10 percent of coal in Africa, particularly Nigeria.&lt;ref name=Iwayemi /&gt; West Africa also exhibits some nuclear resources.&lt;ref name=Iwayemi /&gt; In addition to coal reserves, Nigeria contains natural gas and oil resources.&lt;ref name=Iwayemi /&gt;

“In Guinea, West Africa, the US is making significant input in the area of environmental protection.”&lt;ref name=Africa /&gt; These progressive steps will improve agricultural production technologies and exchange trade opportunities.&lt;ref name=Africa /&gt; “In Guinea 115,000 hectares of forests and tree plantations have been placed under sustainable management…USAID has assisted more than 37,000 farmers to improve agricultural production through sustainable management practices, and has helped establish over 2,800 new businesses.”&lt;ref name=Africa /&gt;

===Central Africa===
Central Africa has abundant hydro-electric resources due to the multiple rivers that run through this region.&lt;ref name=Iwayemi /&gt; The publication Energy Economics estimates that replacing South African coal power with hydroelectric imported from the Democratic Republic of the Congo could save 40 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually.&lt;ref name=Bhat /&gt;

Africa is protecting forest resources.&lt;ref name=Africa /&gt; “USAID will contribute approximately $48 million to partnership through its successful Central African Regional Program for the Environment (CARPE)…goal is to improve forest governance, develop sustainable means of livelihood for 60 million people who live in the Basin, reduce the rate of forest degradation and [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] through protected area management, improve logging policies, and achieve sustainable forest use by local inhabitants.”&lt;ref name=Africa /&gt;

==Human factors and energy==

===Poverty and health===
The utilization of solar water heaters and biodiesel resources in South Africa within recent years reveals that renewable energy can significantly diminish poverty, for the implementation of clean energy systems has led to improvement in health, and general welfare of the people.&lt;ref name=Visagie /&gt; The assimilation of these programs also generates employment, and develops empowerment of the people due to a localized level of energy operation.&lt;ref name=Visagie /&gt;

"Since the turn of the century, the Shri Kshetra Dharmasthala Rural Development Project (SKDRDP) has extended micro-credits for renewable energy projects for a total of $3.2 million to poor farmers in the South Indian state of Karnataka. The credits paid for the installation of almost 20,000 biogas plants, solar home systems, improved cooking stoves and family-size pico-hydropower plants".&lt;ref name=Bosshard /&gt;

===Inequality===
A major concern in Southern Africa is addressing the inequalities associated with the aftermath of the apartheid era.&lt;ref name=Nyabadza /&gt; There are also several other factors or occurrences in Africa that lead to inequality, such as one's location of residence (urban vs. rural), one's access to food, water, and energy, and one's freedom to achieve well-being.&lt;ref name=Sen /&gt; The Human Development Report of 2013 suggests that the regions with the largest gender inequality index values are West and Central Africa; Liberia has the highest at an index of 143, followed by Central African Republic (142), Mauritania (139), Côte d'Ivoire (138), and Cameroon (137).&lt;ref name=Malike /&gt;

===Education===
Energy can facilitate the development of schools, and help teachers gain access to a wide variety of teaching mechanisms, such as potentially computers.&lt;ref name=Jimenez /&gt; Energy can contribute to the allowance for freedom of education.&lt;ref name=Acemoglu /&gt;

==Policy==

===Attracting investment===
As a whole, [[foreign direct investment]] into Africa has been low. According to the Forum of Energy Ministers of Africa, Africa as a whole receives less than 2% of foreign direct investment across the world.&lt;ref name=FEMA /&gt;  A survey of 20 [[Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper]]s prepared by countries across Africa found that most neglect to consider energy or individual energy access as an integral part of their development strategy.&lt;ref name=FEMA /&gt;  Trans-national initiatives play an important role in development for the entire region too.  One example of international cooperation for energy development is the [[Chad-Cameroon pipeline]].&lt;ref name="Davidson"/&gt;

Additionally, “The United States announced USD $2 billion in grants, loans and loan guarantees across U.S. government agencies and departments for capacity-building projects, policy and regulatory development, public-private partnerships, and loan guarantees to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies.”&lt;ref name=Holliday /&gt;

Eskom and Duke Energy currently support an initiative to facilitate an electrical roadmap in Southern Africa. “The goal is to connect 500 million people to modern energy service by 2025".&lt;ref name=Holliday/&gt;

===Privatization===

====Pros====
[[Economics|Economic reasoning]] predicts increased efficiency and lower government overhead from a private contractor.  Privatized Northern Electricity in [[Namibia]] implemented improved billing and reduced losses to lower the required energy [[tariff]] and lower energy prices. Private companies can also work closely with government to provide the social benefits of a state utility in the short term and the competition of a private market for the long term. [[South Africa]] commercialized the formerly public utility [[Eskom]], but worked with them to continue grid expansion. The South African government helps fund new connections and subsidizes the first 100kWh per month for poor households, up from a previous 50kWh per month. By 2005 South Africa's electrification rate had increased to about 70% (from 30% in 1990).&lt;ref name="Power"/&gt;

====Cons====
Privatization can lead to price increases if the market is not otherwise profitable. An unregulated or lightly regulated market could tend towards proven profitable customers too, ignoring riskier opportunities to expand service to rural or poor customers. Extending the electrical grid becomes difficult because of the high upfront investments required to serve a low population density.  According to the Forum of Energy Ministers of Africa, most rural customers can't even afford the install costs of the most basic [[Single phase power|single phase circuit]] with an electrical socket.  Energy subsidies are one possible solution, but they can disproportionately effect demographics who already have access to electricity, missing the most poor.&lt;ref name="Power"/&gt;&lt;ref name=FEMA /&gt;

===Program management reform===
Most development initiatives work at the individual project level, leading to fragmentation and inconsistency between projects that discourage long term investors. Institutional reform is vital to improving the operating efficiency of the electrical sector as a whole. The current hybrid public/private model lacks a clear leading organization with one clear vision of the system's future. Attempts to negotiate management contracts over utility hardware have generally failed, leaving the public utility still burdened with day-to-day hardware support as well as growth, planning, and development. Of 17 high profile African energy management contracts, four were cancelled before they even reached full term, five were not renewed after only one cycle, and five more were dropped in later years. Only three remain in place today.&lt;ref name=AIATTFlagshipReport /&gt;

Smart utility management must meet increased investment in the middle to smartly allocate resources and develop a sustainable grid model. Of the current utilities, "On average, Africa's state-owned power utilities embody only 40% of good governance practices for such enterprise".&lt;ref name=AIATTFlagshipReport /&gt;

Nevertheless, federal support for energy is gaining momentum, especially in Southern Africa. South Africa’s government has established a Joint Implementation Committee to progress the biodiesel industry.&lt;ref name=Visagie /&gt; This committee encompasses a variety of sub-committees, like “South Renewable Energy Technologies for Poverty Alleviation South Africa: Solar Water Heaters and Biodiesel,” and the “African Petroleum Industry Association.&lt;ref name=Visagie /&gt; Plans for the promotion of harvest to create bioethanol are underway, the South African Bureau of Standards is developing pricing models to enable economic growth.&lt;ref name=Visagie /&gt;

“The World Bank and the International Finance Corporation will expand existing programs such as Lighting Africa, which develops off-grid lighting markets, to provide affordable lighting to 70 million low-income households by 2020, as well as undertake new initiatives with the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program, such as mapping of renewable energy resources”.&lt;ref name=Holliday /&gt;

The Global Ministerial Environment Forum in Nairobi, Kenya was broadcast throughout Africa, and comprised a panel of energy experts who discussed the successes achieved in energy in Africa so far, lessons learned from implementations, and future projections for energy.&lt;ref name=Holliday /&gt;

Moreover, the United Nations Development Program and UN Capital Development Fund recently initiated a global Clean Start program, which will enable millions of impoverished people both in Africa and in Asia to shift out of energy poverty by creating microfinance opportunities to encourage poorer individuals to purchase and utilize electricity.&lt;ref name=Holliday /&gt; Twenty-five countries in Africa have joined this global task: Botswana, Burundi, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, São Tomé and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name=Holliday /&gt;

==Future development==

===A sample of current investments===
[[The World Bank]] operates a portfolio of 48 Sub-Saharan Africa energy projects with over $3 billion USD in investment. Individual governments as well as private entities also contribute to overall energy projects.  [[China]] and [[India]] have recently emerged as large players in the space, committing $2 billion USD annually to new development projects. China focused specifically on 10 large [[hydropower]] projects, which combined are expected to produce another 6,000 MW of electrical energy. This is estimated to increase the hydroelectric capabilities of Sub-Saharan Africa by 30%. Another project currently undergoing feasibility exploration would install hydroelectric facilities on the Zambezi river, potentially generating 2,000–2,500 MW. Smaller scale projects also receive funding, such as efforts to distribute safe cookstoves and efficient kilns to lower the effects of biomass, initiatives to improve lighting efficiency, or smaller scale microgrid electrical distributions.&lt;ref name=wbFactSheet /&gt;&lt;ref name=AIATTFlagshipReport /&gt;&lt;ref name=karekezi&gt;Karekezi, Stephen, and Waeni Kithyoma. Renewable Energy Development. Rep. The United Nations, n.d. Web. 20 Sept. 2012. [https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/sdissues/energy/op/nepadkarekezi Renewable Energy Development].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional pools===

One characterizing feature of the electrical grid in Africa is its isolation.&lt;ref name=unScaleUp&gt;Scaling Up Renewable Energy in Africa. Rep. Vienna: United Nations Industrial Development Organization, 2009. United Nations Industrial Development Organization, 2009. Web. 20 Sept. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of regional [[energy trading]] pools would help stabilize energy markets, but would require building out a transmission line infrastructure between countries.&lt;ref name=wbFactSheet /&gt; Installing those resources would be expected to require ~$19 billion USD in investment.&lt;ref name=orvika&gt;Orvika, Rosnes, and Vennemo Haakon. "The Cost Of Providing Electricity To Africa." Energy Economics 34.(n.d.): 1318–28. ScienceDirect. Web. 6 Sept. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Regional energy trade would save an estimated $5 billion USD annually in emergency generation costs, yielding a 22% [[rate of return]] even at 5% deflation.&lt;ref name=orvika /&gt;  Energy economist Orvika Rosnes estimates that fair regional pooling in the least developed countries could actually generate money in less than one year, with a 168% annual return on investment.&lt;ref name=orvika /&gt;

===Projected needs===
Creating an effective and far reaching modern electrical system in Africa will take significant investment.  The [[African Development Bank]] has estimated that a universal access system for all 53 countries in Africa would cost $547 billion USD total to implement by 2030, which averages to $27 billion USD per year.&lt;ref name=unScaleUp /&gt; Total investment has not come close to this mark, instead hovering until recently between $1–2 billion USD annually.&lt;ref name=wbFactSheet /&gt;  Recent participation from [[China]] and [[India]] on the order of $2 Billion USD annually brings the investment total up to ~$4 billion USD.&lt;ref name=AIATTFlagshipReport /&gt;  The power sector still faces a finance gap on the order of $23 billion USD per year though, severely constraining its development options.&lt;ref name=AIATTFlagshipReport /&gt;  Operating at 1/4 of the necessary budget to grow and expand, current networks must mark most funds for maintenance of aging existing systems.&lt;ref name=AIATTFlagshipReport /&gt;

==Aid and world energy supply capabilities==

===Relationship to the Millennium Development Goals===
Access to modern forms of Energy can impact socio-economic parameters like income, education, and life expectancy.&lt;ref name=FEMA&gt;The Forum of Energy Ministers of Africa. Energy and the [[Millennium Development Goals]] in Africa. Rep. N.p.: ESMAP, n.d. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Energy can act as a multiplier of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] through its ability to stimulate economic growth to generate employment, improve educational opportunities, and improve general health compared to existing energy sources.&lt;ref name=FEMA /&gt;  Research of past successful development suggests that energy, especially from [[transportation]] and [[industry]], helped drive growth and modernization&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt;
* '''Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger''': Access to contemporary energy can help generate jobs, industrial activities, transportation, and modernized agriculture in Africa. Most African staple foods need processing, which can be aided and made more efficient by modern energy.  Access to liquefied propane gas stoves in Senegal led to major domestic time savings and improved nutrition.&lt;ref name=SOKONA&gt;Sokona, Y (2000) “Widening access of rural energy services in Africa: What perspectives
from the multi-functional platform case in Mali.” Business Briefing: Global power engineering &amp; Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Achieve universal primary education''': Energy access improves the capabilities of schools and lowers the sustenance chore burden on children (female children in particular), allowing them more time to pursue education.  Energy can also improve the quality of schools and build connections to surrounding communities.&lt;ref name="Power"/&gt;
* '''Promote gender equality and empower women''': Household activities traditionally done by women could be made more efficient, leaving time for other means of self-development or productive economic input.
* '''Reduce child mortality''': Modern energy can allow reliable access to better sources of water and lowers the indoor air pollution from existing biomaterial burning cooking stoves.
* '''Improved maternal health''': Energy development lowers a mother's risk from indoor air pollution or water borne illness.  Electricity also enables better illumination in health clinics for safer night deliveries.  Poorly ventilated surroundings have been linked to chronic respiratory diseases like tuberculosis, bronchitis, and lung cancer.&lt;ref name=SMITH&gt;Smith, K.R (1998). “The National Burden of Diseases from Indoor Air Pollution in India.” Mumbai, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases''': Electrification allows for sterilization, illumination, and refrigeration.  Modern communication technologies can also aid information dissemination from public health officials.
* '''Ensure environmental sustainability''': Transitioning to modern energy models will facilitate future sustainable resource development and slow present land resource degradation.  Research has linked charcoal production to desertification and deforestation.&lt;ref name=FEMA /&gt;

[[File:Generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity.svg|thumb|300px|Physical components of a generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity (but not [[district heating|district heat]]) to end-users]]

An '''energy system''' is a system primarily designed to supply [[#Energy-services|energy-services]] to [[end user|end-users]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}  Taking a structural viewpoint, the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] defines an energy system as "all components related to the production, conversion, delivery, and use of energy".&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}  The field of [[energy economics]] includes [[energy market]]s and treats an energy system as the technical and economic systems that satisfy [[consumer demand]] for energy in the forms of [[heat]], [[fuel]]s, and [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}

The first two definitions allow for demand-side measures, including [[daylighting]], retrofitted [[building insulation]], and [[passive solar building design]], as well as socio-economic factors, such as aspects of [[energy demand management]] and even [[telecommuting]], while the third does not.  Neither does the third account for the [[Informal sector|informal economy]] in traditional [[biomass]] that is significant in many [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name="van-ruijven-etal-2008"/&gt;

The analysis of energy systems thus spans the disciplines of [[engineering]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|1}}  Merging ideas from both areas to form a coherent description, particularly where [[macroeconomic]] dynamics are involved, is challenging.&lt;ref name="boehringer-and-rutherford-2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="herbst-etal-2012"/&gt;

The concept of an energy system is evolving as new regulations, technologies, and practices enter into service – for example, [[emissions trading]], the development of [[smart grid]]s, and the greater use of [[energy demand management]], respectively.

== Treatment ==

{{see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling}}
&lt;!-- {(see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling|Open energy system models}} --&gt;

From a structural perspective, an energy system is like any [[System|general system]] and is made up of a set of interacting component parts, located within an environment.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster-system"/&gt;  These components derive from ideas found in [[engineering]] and [[economics]].  Taking a process view, an energy system "consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework".&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|423}}  The identification of the components and behaviors of an energy system depends on the circumstances, the purpose of the analysis, and the questions under investigation.  The concept of an energy system is therefore an [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstraction]] which usually precedes some form of computer-based investigation, such as the construction and use of a suitable [[energy modeling|energy model]].&lt;ref name="anandarajah-etal-2009"/&gt;

Viewed in engineering terms, an energy system lends itself to representation as a [[flow network]]: the [[Glossary of graph theory#vertex|vertices]] map to engineering components like [[power station]]s and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and the [[Glossary of graph theory#edge|edges]] map to the interfaces between these components.  This approach allows collections of similar or adjacent components to be aggregated and treated as one to simplify the model.  Once described thus, flow network algorithms, such as [[minimum-cost flow problem|minimum cost flow]], may be applied.&lt;ref name="quelhas-etal-2007"/&gt;  The components themselves can be treated as simple [[dynamical systems]] in their own right.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;

Conversely, relatively pure economic modeling may adopt a sectorial approach with only limited engineering detail present.  The sector and sub-sector categories published by the [[International Energy Agency]] are often used as a basis for this analysis.  A 2009 study of the UK residential energy sector contrasts the use of the technology-rich [[Markal model]] with several UK sectoral housing stock models.&lt;ref name="kannan-and-strachan-2007"/&gt;

International [[statistical study of energy data|energy statistics]] are typically broken down by carrier, sector and sub-sector, and country.&lt;ref name="ires-2016"/&gt;  Energy carriers ({{abbr|aka|also known as}} energy products) are further classified as [[primary energy]] and [[primary energy#Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)|secondary]] (or intermediate) energy and sometimes final (or end-use) energy.  Published energy datasets are normally adjusted so that they are internally consistent, meaning that all energy stocks and flows must [[Energy balance (energy economics)|balance]].  The IEA regularly publishes energy statistics and energy balances with varying levels of detail and cost and also offers mid-term projections based on this data.&lt;ref name="iea-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iea-2016b"/&gt;  The notion of an energy carrier, as used in [[energy economics]], is distinct and different from the definition of [[energy]] used in physics.

Energy systems can range in scope, from local, municipal, national, and regional, to global, depending on issues under investigation.  Researchers may or may not include demand side measures within their definition of an energy system.  The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] does so, for instance, but covers these measures in separate chapters on transport, buildings, industry, and agriculture.{{efn|The IPCC chapter on agriculture is titled: Agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU).}}&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|516}}

Household consumption and investment decisions may also be included within the ambit of an energy system.  Such considerations are not common because consumer behavior is difficult to characterize, but the trend is to include human factors in models.  Household decision-taking may be represented using techniques from [[bounded rationality]] and [[Agent-based model|agent-based behavior]].&lt;ref name="wittmann-and-bruckner-2009"/&gt;  The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) specifically advocates that "more attention should be paid to incorporating behavioral considerations other than price- and income-driven behavior into economic models [of the energy system]".&lt;ref name="aaas-2011"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

== Energy-services ==

{{see also|Energy conservation|Efficient energy use}}

The concept of an energy-service is central, particularly when defining the purpose of an energy system:

{{quote|It is important to realize that the use of energy is no end in itself but is always directed to satisfy human needs and desires. Energy services are the ends for which the energy system provides the means.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}}}

Energy-services can be defined as amenities that are either furnished through energy consumption or could have been thus supplied.&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2005"/&gt;{{rp|2}}  More explicitly:

{{quote|Demand should, where possible, be defined in terms of energy-service provision, as characterized by an appropriate intensity{{efn|The term ''intensity'' refers to quantities which do not scale with component size.  See [[intensive and extensive properties]].}} – for example, air [[temperature]] in the case of space-heating or [[lux]] levels for [[illuminance]]. This approach facilitates a much greater set of potential responses to the question of supply, including the use of energetically-passive techniques – for instance, retrofitted [[Building insulation|insulation]] and [[daylighting]].&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2003"/&gt;{{rp|156}}}}

A consideration of energy-services per capita and how such services contribute to human welfare and individual quality of life is paramount to the debate on [[sustainable energy]].  People living in poor regions with low levels of energy-services consumption would clearly benefit from greater consumption, but the same is not generally true for those with high levels of consumption.&lt;ref name="haas-etal-2008"/&gt;

The notion of energy-services has given rise to [[energy service company|energy-service companies]] (ESCo) who contract to provide energy-services to a client for an extended period.

ISO{{nnbsp}}13600, ISO{{nnbsp}}13601, and ISO{{nnbsp}}13602 form a set of [[international standard]]s covering technical energy systems (TES).&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-main"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-corrigendum-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13601-1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13602-2002"/&gt;  Although withdrawn prior to 2016, these documents provide useful definitions and a framework for formalizing such systems.  The standards depict an energy system broken down into supply and demand sectors, linked by the flow of tradable energy commodities (or energywares).  Each sector has a set of inputs and outputs, some intentional and some harmful byproducts.  Sectors may be further divided into subsectors, each fulfilling a dedicated purpose.  The demand sector is ultimately present to supply energyware-based services to consumers (see [[#Energy-services|energy-services]]).

This approach facilitates a much greater set of potential responses to the question of supply, including the use of energetically-passive techniques – for instance, retrofitted insulation and daylighting.

 | quote = In energy economics, energy systems are usually defined as technical and economic systems meeting the energy demand.  "However, the energy demand is not a fixed quantity but is subject to various influences, e.g., prices, regulations, and consumer preferences. Thus, the definition of energy systems should provide a much broader, socioeconomic view and refer to the technical and economic side of energy supply as well as the socioeconomic phenomena occurring in a society, which uses energy to enhance its standard of living; furthermore the impact on the natural environment is important. ... It is important to realize that the use of energy is no end in itself but is always directed to satisfy human needs and desires. Energy services are the ends for which the energy system provides the means. (page 941)

 | quote = The energy system consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework.  Energy is a vital component in the economic and social well-being of a nation and must be considered explicitly in the formulation of regional, national, and international policy.  As the importance of energy in policy making has become apparent, research and analysis in the field of energy system modeling and forecasting has grown rapidly.  The field has evolved from one almost exclusively the domain of planning groups in the major sectors of the energy industry and of government regulatory agencies to one in which many Federal and State agencies are active in the development and application of energy models and forecasts.  Energy system models are now used extensively for regional, national and international forecasting and for policy formulation and analysis.

[[File:Elizabeth Island.jpg|thumb|Fletcher{{'s}} map of [[Elizabeth Island (Cape Horn)|Elizabeth Island]] off [[Cape Horn]] ]]
'''Francis Fletcher''' ({{circa|1555}}&amp;nbsp;– {{circa|1619}}) was a priest of the [[Church of England]] who accompanied [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] on his [[circumnavigation]] of the world from 1577 to 1580 and kept a written account of it.

==Life==
Much is known about Fletcher's three years of voyaging around the world with Drake, but there is little certain information about the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=quinn&gt;David B. Quinn, ''Explorers and Colonies: America, 1500–1625'' (Continuum, 1990), [https://books.google.com/books?id=P7OuMkzGKw0C&amp;pg=PA194 p. 194]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Venn]] identified Fletcher with a man of this name who entered [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], in 1574, but did not take a degree.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Venn]], [[John Archibald Venn]], ''[[Alumni Cantabrigienses|Alumni Cantabrigienses: A Biographical List of All Known Students, Graduates and Holders of Office at the University of Cambridge, from the Earliest Times to 1900]]'', vol. 2 (1922)&lt;/ref&gt; He was briefly Rector of [[St. Mary Magdalen, Milk Street|St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street]], a parish of the [[City of London]], resigning in July 1576 to join Drake in his preparation of a fleet for purposes which are still disputed.&lt;ref&gt;George Hennessy, ''Novam repertorium ecclesiasticum Londonense'' (London, 1898), p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; He acted as Drake's chaplain during the three-year voyage which ensued, keeping a journal of their adventures which he handed to Drake on the expedition's return to England in 1580.&lt;ref name=quinn/&gt;

In September 1578, Drake's own ship, the ''[[Golden Hind]]'', passed the [[Strait of Magellan]] amid storms, and Fletcher recorded that the ship was driven to the "utmost island of Terra Incognita".&lt;ref&gt;William Edmundson, ''A History of the British Presence in Chile'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=WVjCAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt; He made a map of "Elizabeth Iland" ''(pictured)'',&lt;ref name=BL&gt;British Library, ''Sir Francis Drake: an exhibition to commemorate Francis Drake's Voyage around the World, 1577–1580'' (London, 1977), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; which Fletcher and Drake claimed for England, naming it [[Elizabeth Island (Cape Horn)|Elizabeth Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Raup Wagner, ''Sir Francis Drake's Voyage Around the World'' (1926), p. 92: "Fletcher's act of taking possession".&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Fletcher was sometimes at odds with Drake. In a sermon he preached to the expedition in January 1580, Fletcher suggested that their ships' recent woes had resulted from the unjust death of [[Thomas Doughty (explorer)|Thomas Doughty]], whom Drake had ordered to be beheaded on 2 July 1578. After the sermon, Drake had Fletcher chained to a hatch cover,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Whitfield, ''Sir Francis Drake'' (2004), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; then "solemnly [[excommunication|excommunicated]] him".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Oakeshott, ''Founded Upon the Seas: A Narrative of Some English Maritime and Overseas Enterprises during the Period 1550–1616'' (1942, new edition 2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=OcF5AvMjoLAC&amp;pg=PA83 p. 83]&lt;/ref&gt;

Venn states that Fletcher was Rector of [[Bradenham, Buckinghamshire|Bradenham]] in Buckinghamshire from 1579 to 1592, but a later writer, David B.

Fletcher's log of Drake's voyage formed the basis of ''The World Encompassed by Sir Francis Drake'', an account of the voyage published in London in 1628 at the instigation of Drake's nephew, another [[Sir Francis Drake, 1st Baronet|Francis Drake]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/service/rbc/rbdk/d042/00070000.jpg The World Encompassed by Sir Francis Drake... carefully collected out of the Notes of Master Francis Fletcher] (London, Nicholas Bourne, 1628)&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of the first part of Fletcher's journal was made by a man named John Conyers, described as "Citizen and Apothecary of London", about 1677, and this survives in the [[British Library]], catalogued as "Sloane MS 61, ''Francis Fletcher's Log''".&lt;ref name=quinn/&gt;&lt;ref name=BL/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1646">'''Giovanni Jacopo Spada''' (1680 - 1774) was an Italian naturalist and pioneering geologist, born in [[Verona]], who served for many years as [[archipresbyter]] at [[Graz]] in [[Styria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minrec.org/libdetail.asp?id=1327 Curtis Shuh, ''Biobibliography of Mineralogy'': "Spada, Giovanni Giacomo"]&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for the revised and expanded catalogue of his collection that he published in 1744, ''Corporum lapidefactorum agri veronensis catalogus quæ apud Joan. Jacobum Spadam Gretianae Archipresbyterum Aasservantur'' A first version, now very rare, had been published in 1739. His dissertation of 1737 at the [[University of Verona]] asserted that [[fossil]]s, then known as ''petrifications'', of recognizably marine species, to be found in the mountains near Verona, were neither "sports of Nature" nor the products of the biblical [[Great Deluge]], but ''antediluvian''.&lt;ref&gt;''Dissertazione ove si Prova, che li Petrificati Corpi Marini, che nei Monti Adiacenti a Verona si Trovano, non sono Scherzi di Natura, nè Diluviani, ma Antediluviani''.&lt;/ref&gt; He was listed among the subscribers to the corpus of Latin inscriptions assembled at Verona (and other north Italian locations), the ''Museum Veronense hoc est antiquarum inscriptionum atque anaglyphorum...'' (Verona 1749).

Though Spada is barely remembered today, he was commemorated in the [[snail]] ''[[Candidula spadae]]'', described by [[Pietro Calcara]] in 1845.

The region between the current leading edge of the [[glacier]] and the [[moraine]]s of latest maximum is called '''glacier foreland''' or '''glacier forefield'''. In the [[Alps]] this maximum was in 1850 and since then the region has become ice free due to [[deglaciation]]. Because of this relative recent development of [[vegetation]] and morphodynamic the glacier foreland differs considerably from the surrounding landscape.

'''Glacier ice accumulation''' occurs through accumulation of [[snow]] and other frozen [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], as well as through other means including [[rime ice]] (freezing of [[water vapor]] on the [[glacier]] surface), [[avalanche|avalanching]] from [[hanging glacier]]s on cliffs and mountainsides above, and re-freezing of glacier [[meltwater]] as [[superimposed ice]].  Accumulation is one element in the [[glacier mass balance]] formula, with [[Ablation zone|ablation]] counteracting.  With successive years in which accumulation exceeds ablation, then a glacier will experience positive [[glacier mass balance|mass balance]], and its [[glacier terminus|terminus]] will advance.

==Accumulation zones==
[[Glaciologist]]s subdivide glaciers into glacier accumulation zones, based on the melting and refreezing occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Müller, F. | year = 1962 | title = '''Zonation in the accumulation area of the glaciers of Axel Heiberg Island''' | journal = Journal of Glaciology | volume = 4 | pages = 302–313 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Patterson | first = W.S.B. | title = The Physics of Glaciers  | edition = 3rd | year = 1994 | publisher = Pergamon | location = Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; These zones include the dry snow zone, in which the ice entirely retains subfreezing temperatures and no melting occurs.  Dry snow zones only occur within the interior regions of the [[Greenland]] and [[Antarctica]] [[ice sheet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Benn | first = Douglas I. |author2=David J.A. Evans | title = Glaciers and Glaciation | year = 1998 | publisher = Arnold Publishers| location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Benson, C.S. | year = 1961 | title = '''Stratigraphic studies in the snow and firn of the Greenland Ice Sheet''' | journal = Folia Geographica Danica | volume = 9 | pages = 13–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Below the dry snow zone is the [[percolation]] zone, where some meltwater penetrates down into the glacier where it refreezes.  In the wet snow zone, all the seasonal snow melts.  The meltwater either percolates into the depths of the glacier or flows down-glacier where it might refreeze as superimposed ice.  A glacier's [[equilibrium line]] is located at the lower limit of the wet snow zone.

[[Image:Glacier Mass Balance.png|right|thumb|Global glacial mass balance in the last fifty years, reported to the [[World Glacier Monitoring Service|WGMS]] and [[National Snow and Ice Data Center|NSIDC]]. The downward trend in the late 1980s is symptomatic of the increased rate and number of retreating glaciers.]]

Crucial to the survival of a [[glacier]] is its '''mass balance''' or '''surface mass balance''' (SMB), the difference between [[glacier ice accumulation|accumulation]] and [[Ablation zone|ablation]] (sublimation and melting). [[Climate change]] may cause variations in both temperature and snowfall, causing changes in the surface mass balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Mauri S. Pelto (Nichols College) | title=Glacier Mass Balance of North Cascade, Washington Glaciers 1984–2004 | work=In "Hydrologic Processes" | url=http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/mb.htm | accessdate=February 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in mass balance control a glacier's long-term behavior and are the most sensitive climate indicators on a glacier.&lt;ref name="Michael Zemp, WGMS"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.geo.unizh.ch/wgms/mbb/mbb9/sum06.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307225657/http://www.geo.unizh.ch/wgms/mbb/mbb9/sum06.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=March 7, 2008| title=Glacier Mass Balance| work=World Glacier Monitoring Service| author=Michael Zemp, WGMS| date=September 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1980–2012 the mean cumulative mass loss of glaciers reporting mass balance to the World Glacier Monitoring Service is −16 m. This includes 23 consecutive years of negative mass balances.&lt;ref name="Michael Zemp, WGMS"/&gt;
[[File:Bams 2013.jpg|thumbnail|Chart of annual and cumulative glacier mass balance from World Glacier Monitoring Service Data]]

A glacier with a sustained negative balance is out of equilibrium and will retreat, while one with a sustained positive balance is out of equilibrium and will advance. Glacier retreat results in the loss of the low elevation region of the glacier. Since higher elevations are cooler than lower ones, the disappearance of the lowest portion of the glacier reduces overall ablation, thereby increasing mass balance and potentially reestablishing equilibrium.  However, if the mass balance of a significant portion of the accumulation zone of the glacier is negative, it is in disequilibrium with the local climate. Such a glacier will melt away with a continuation of this local climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Mauri S. Pelto (Nichols College) | title=The Disequilibrium of North Cascade, Washington Glaciers 1984–2004 | work=In "Hydrologic Processes" | url=http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/diseqilibrium.html| accessdate=February 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The key symptom of a glacier in disequilibrium is thinning along the entire length of the glacier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Pelto, M.S. | title=Forecasting temperate alpine glacier survival from accumulation zone observations | journal=The Cryosphere | year=2010 | volume=4 |  pages=67–75 | url=http://www.the-cryosphere.net/4/67/2010/tc-4-67-2010.pdf | accessdate=February 9, 2010 | doi=10.5194/tc-4-67-2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Easton Glacier (pictured below) will likely shrink to half its size, but at a slowing rate of reduction, and stabilize at that size, despite the warmer temperature, over a few decades. However, the [[Grinnell Glacier]] (pictured below) will shrink at an increasing rate until it disappears. The difference is that the upper section of Easton Glacier remains healthy and snow-covered, while even the upper section of the Grinnell Glacier is bare, melting and has thinned. Small glaciers with shallow slopes such as Grinnell Glacier are most likely to fall into disequilibrium if there is a change in the local climate.

In the case of positive mass balance, the glacier will continue to advance expanding its low elevation area, resulting in more melting.  If this still does not create an equilibrium balance the glacier will continue to advance. If a glacier is near a large body of water, especially an ocean, the glacier may advance until iceberg [[Ice calving|calving]] losses bring about equilibrium.

== Definitions ==
[[File:Glacier accumulation ablation and net mass flux graph.png|thumb|Accumulation, ablation (shown here as positive), and the net mass flux of a glacier (the sum of both, with ablation taken to be negative).  A balance year is the combination of an accumulation season and an ablation season.&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1999), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;|upright=3]]

=== Accumulation ===
The different processes by which a glacier can gain mass are collectively known as accumulation.  Snowfall is the most obvious form of accumulation.  Avalanches, particularly in steep mountain environments, can also add mass to a glacier.  Other methods include deposition of wind-blown snow; the freezing of liquid water, including rainwater and meltwater; deposition of frost in various forms; and the expansion of a floating area of ice by the freezing of additional ice to it.  Snowfall is the predominant form of accumulation overall, but in specific situations other processes may be more important; for example, avalanches can be much more important than snowfall in small cirque basins.&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1999), pp. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accumulation can be measured at a single point on the glacier, or for any area of the glacier.  The units of accumulation are meters: 1 meter accumulation means that the additional mass of ice for that area, if turned to water, would increase the depth of the glacier by 1 meter.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Paterson (1981), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The accumulation can also be expressed in terms of the mass, or of the depth of ice that the mass would form.  The latter is commonly used in studies of ice dynamics.&lt;ref name=CP94&gt;Cuffey &amp; Paterson (2010), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

=== Ablation ===
Ablation is the reverse of accumulation: it includes all the processes by which a glacier can lose mass.  The main ablation process for most glaciers that are entirely land-based is melting; the heat that causes melting can come from sunlight, or ambient air, or from rain falling on the glacier, or from geothermal heat below the glacier bed.  Sublimation of ice to vapor is an important ablation mechanism for glaciers in arid environments, high altitudes, and very cold environments, and can account for all the surface ice loss in some cases, such as the Taylor Glacier in the Transantarctic Mountains.  Sublimation consumes a great deal of energy, compared to melting, so high levels of sublimation have the effect of reducing overall ablation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Knight (1999), pp. 31-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow can also be eroded from glaciers by wind, and avalanches can remove snow and ice; these can be important in some glaciers.  Calving, in which ice detaches from the snout of a glacier that terminates in water, forming icebergs, is a significant form of ablation for many glaciers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As with accumulation, ablation can be measured at a single point on the glacier, or for any area of the glacier, and the units are meters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Rates, mass flux, and balance year ===
Glaciers typically accumulate mass during part of the year, and lose mass the rest of the year; these are the "accumulation season" and "ablation season" respectively.  This definition means that the accumulation rate is greater than the ablation rate during the accumulation season, and during the ablation season the reverse is true.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Knight (1999), p. 23-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  A "balance year" is defined as the time between two consecutive minima in the glaciers mass—that is, from the start of one accumulation season through to the start of the next.  The snow surface at these minima, where snow begins to accumulate again at the start of each accumulation season, is identifiable in the stratigraphy of the snow, so using balance years to measure glacier mass balance is known as the stratigraphic method.  The alternative is to use a fixed calendar date, but this requires a field visit to the glacier each year on that date, and so it is not always possible to strictly adhere to the exact dates for the fixed year method.&lt;ref&gt;Benn &amp; Evans (2010), pp. 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass balance===
The mass balance of a glacier is the net change in its mass over a balance year or fixed year. If accumulation exceeds ablation for a given year, the mass balance is positive; if the reverse is true, the mass balance is negative.  These terms can be applied to a particular point on the glacier to give the "specific mass balance" for that point; or to the entire glacier or any smaller area.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

For many glaciers, accumulation is concentrated in winter, and ablation in the summer; these are referred to as "winter-accumulation" glaciers.  For some glaciers, the local climate leads to accumulation and ablation both occurring in the same season.  These are known as "summer-accumulation" glaciers; examples are found in the Himalayas and Tibet.  The layers that make winter-accumulation glaciers easy to monitor via the stratigraphic method are not usable, so fixed date monitoring is preferable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Equilibrium line ===
For winter-accumulation glaciers, the specific mass balance is usually positive for the upper part of the glacier—in other words, the accumulation area of the glacier is the upper part of its surface.  The line dividing the accumulation area from the ablation area—the lower part of the glacier—is called the equilibrium line; it is the line at which the specific net balance is zero.  The altitude of the equilibrium line, abbreviated as ELA, is a key indicator of the health of the glacier; and since the ELA is usually easier to measure than the overall mass balance of the glacier it is often taken as a proxy for the mass balance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Symbols ===
The most frequently used standard variables in mass-balance research are:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Cogley et al. (2010), pp. 2-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

* a – ablation
* c – accumulation
* b – mass balance (c + a)
* ρ – density
* h – glacier thickness
* S – area
* V – volume
* AAR – accumulation-area ratio
* ELA – equilibrium-line altitude

By default, a term in lower case refers to the value at a specific point on the glacier's surface; a term in upper case refers to the value across the entire glacier.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Measurement methods==
[[Image:eastonterm.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Easton Glacier which retreated 255&amp;nbsp;m from 1990 to 2005 is expected to achieve equilibrium.]]
[[Image:Grinnell Glacier2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Grinnell Glacier]] in [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)]] showing recession since 1850 of 1.1&amp;nbsp;km [[USGS]]]]

===Mass balance===
To determine mass balance in the accumulation zone, snowpack depth is measured using probing, snowpits or [[crevasse]] stratigraphy. Crevasse stratigraphy makes use of annual layers revealed on the wall of a crevasse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/mb.htm | title=Glacier Mass Balance | work=North Cascade Glacier Climate Project |author1=Mauri S. Pelto |author2=Director NCGCP | date=March 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akin to tree rings, these layers are due to summer dust deposition and other seasonal effects. The advantage of crevasse [[stratigraphy]] is that it provides a two-dimensional measurement of the snowpack layer, not a point measurement.  It is also usable in depths where probing or snowpits are not feasible. In temperate glaciers, the insertion resistance of a probe increases abruptly when its tip reaches ice that was formed the previous year. The probe depth is a measure of the net accumulation above that layer. Snowpits dug through the past winters residual snowpack are used to determine the snowpack depth and density.  The snowpack's mass balance is the product of density and depth. Regardless of depth measurement technique the observed depth is multiplied by the snowpack density to determine the accumulation in water equivalent. It is necessary to measure the density in the spring as snowpack density varies.  Measurement of snowpack density completed at the end of the ablation season yield consistent values for a particular area on temperate alpine glaciers and need not be measured every year. In the ablation zone, ablation measurements are made using stakes inserted vertically into the glacier either at the end of the previous melt season or the beginning of the current one. The length of stake exposed by melting ice is measured at the end of the melt (ablation) season. Most stakes must be replaced each year or even midway through the summer.

[[Image:Glaciercrevasse.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Measuring snowpack in a crevasse on the Easton Glacier, North Cascades, USA, the two dimensional nature of the annual layers is apparent]]
[[Image:Snowpitglacier.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Measuring snowpack on the Taku Glacier in Alaska, this is a slow and inefficient process, but is very accurate]]

===Net balance===
Net balance is the mass balance determined between successive mass balance minimums.  This is the stratigraphic method focusing on the minima representing a stratigraphic horizon. In the northern mid-latitudes, a glacier's year follows the hydrologic year, starting and ending near the beginning of October.  The mass balance minimum is the end of the melt season. The net balance is then the sum of the observed winter balance (bw) normally measured in April or May and summer balance (bs) measured in September or early October.[[Image:probingglacier.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Measuring snowpack on the Easton Glacier by probing to the previous impenetrable surface, this provides a quick accurate point measurement of snowpack]]

===Annual balance===
Annual balance is the mass balance measured between specific dates.  The mass balance is measured on the fixed date each year, again sometime near the start of October in the mid northern latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nichols.edu/departments/Glacier/north%20cascade%20glacier%20mass%20balance.htm | title=Glacier Mass Balance | work=North Cascade Glacier Climate Project |author1=Mauri S. Pelto |author2=Director NCGCP | date=March 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geodetic methods===
Geodetic methods are an indirect method for the determination of mass balance of glacier. Maps of a glacier made at two different points in time can be compared and the difference in glacier thickness observed used to determine the mass balance over a span of years. This is best accomplished today using Differential [[Global Positioning System]]. Sometimes the earliest data for the glacier surface profiles is from images that are used to make [[topographical map]]s and [[digital elevation model]]s. Aerial mapping or [[photogrammetry]] is now used to cover larger glaciers and icecaps such found in [[Antarctica]] and [[Greenland]], however, because of the problems of establishing accurate ground control points in mountainous terrain, and correlating features in snow and where shading is common, elevation errors are typically not less than 10&amp;nbsp;m (32&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=David Rippin |author2=Ian Willis |author3=Neil Arnold |author4=Andrew Hodson |author5=John Moore |author6=Jack Kohler |author7=Helgi Bjornsson | title= Changes in Geometry and Subglacial Drainage of Midre Lovénbreen, Svalbard, Determined from Digital Elevation Models | journal= [[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]]| year= 2003| volume= 28| issue=3| pages= 273–298| url= http://www.ulapland.fi/home/hkunta/jmoore/pdfs/Rippin_et_al_2003.pdf| doi= 10.1002/esp.485|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laser altimetry provides a measurement of the elevation of a glacier along a specific path, e.g., the glacier centerline. The difference of two such measurements is the change in thickness, which provides mass balance over the time interval between the measurements.  Again a good method over a span of time but not for annual change detection. The value of geodetic programs is providing an independent check of traditional mass balance work, by comparing the cumulative changes over ten or more years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vaw.ethz.ch/research/glaciology/glacier_mechanics/gz_mass_balance_photogrammetric | title=Mass Balance Determination using Photogrammetric Methods and Numerical Flow Modeling | work=Laboratory of Hydraulics, Hydrology and Glaciology | author1=Andreas Bauder | author2=G.

==Mass balance research worldwide==
Mass balance studies have been carried out in various countries worldwide, but have mostly conducted in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] due to there being more mid-latitude glaciers in that hemisphere.  The World Glacier Monitoring Service annually compiles the mass balance measurements from around the world.  From 2002–2006, continuous data is available for only 7 glaciers in the southern hemisphere and 76 glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere. The mean balance of these glaciers was its most negative in any year for 2005/06.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work =WGMS| title =Glacier Mass Balance Bulletin| url =http://www.geo.unizh.ch/wgms/gmbb.html| accessdate =2008-03-09| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080320211932/http://www.geo.unizh.ch/wgms/gmbb.html| archivedate =2008-03-20| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The similarity of response of glaciers in western North America indicates the large scale nature of the driving climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pelto |first=Mauri |url=http://clic.npolar.no/newsletters/archive/ice_climate_2007_06_no_09.pdf |title=Western North American Glacier Mass Balance 1984–2005, Equilibrium or Disequilibrium Response? |publisher=North Cascade Glacier Climate Project |work=Climate and Cryosphere |accessdate=2008-03-09 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510055831/http://clic.npolar.no/newsletters/archive/ice_climate_2007_06_no_09.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alaska===
The [[Taku Glacier]] near [[Juneau, Alaska]] has been studied by the Juneau Icefield Research Program since 1946, and is the longest continuous mass balance study of any glacier in [[North America]]. Taku is the world's thickest known temperate alpine glacier, and experienced positive mass balance between the years 1946 and 1988, resulting in a huge advance. The glacier has since been in a negative mass balance state, which may result in a retreat if the current trends continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Pelto| first =Mauri| authorlink =|author2=Matt Beedle |author3=Maynard M.

The glacier has had an average annual balance of −0.44 m per year from 1953–2006, resulting in a mean loss of over 27 m of ice thickness.  This loss has been confirmed by laser altimetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|  authorlink =Mauri Pelto and Maynard M.

===Austrian Glacier Mass Balance===
The mass balance of Hintereisferner and Kesselwandferner glaciers in [[Austria]] have been continuously monitored since 1952 and 1965 respectively.  Having been continuously measured for 55 years, Hintereisferner has one of the longest periods of continuous study of any glacier in the world, based on measured data and a consistent method of evaluation. Currently this measurement network comprises about 10 snow pits and about 50 ablation stakes distributed across the glacier.  In terms of the cumulative specific balances, Hintereisferner experienced a net loss of mass between 1952 and 1964, followed by a period of recovery to 1968. Hintereisferner reached an intermittent minimum in 1976, briefly recovered in 1977 and 1978 and has continuously lost mass in the 30 years since then.  Total mass loss has been 26 m since 1952&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Mass balance of Hintereisferner| website =| publisher =Institute for Meteorology and Geophysics, University of Innsbruck, Austria| date =January 20, 2004| url =http://meteo9.uibk.ac.at/IceClim/HEF/mass.html| accessdate =2007-01-09| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://archive.is/20041105194425/http://meteo9.uibk.ac.at/IceClim/HEF/mass.html| archivedate =November 5, 2004| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonnblickkees Glacier has been measured since 1957 and the glacier has lost 12 m of mass, an average annual loss of −0.23 m per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geo.unizh.ch/wgms/mbb/mbb9/mbb9.pdf |format=PDF |title=GLACIER MASS BALANCE BULLETIN, Bulletin No. 9 (2004–2005) |publisher=World glacier Monitoring Service, University of Zurich, Switzerland |year=2007 |accessdate=2009-06-27 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
Glacier mass balance studies have been ongoing in [[New Zealand]] since 1957. [[Tasman Glacier]] has been studied since then by the New Zealand Geological Survey and later by the Ministry of Works, measuring the ice stratigraphy and overall movement. However, even earlier fluctuation patterns were documented on the [[Franz Josef Glacier|Franz Josef]] and [[Fox Glacier]]s in 1950. Other glaciers on the [[South Island]] studied include [[Ivory Glacier]] since 1968, while on the [[North Island]], glacier retreat and mass balance research has been conducted on the glaciers on [[Mount Ruapehu]] since 1955. On Mount Ruapehu, permanent photographic stations allow repeat photography to be used to provide photographic evidence of changes to the glaciers on the mountain over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Glaciers of New Zealand | work =Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World| publisher =U.S. Geological Survey| url =http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/p1386h/nzealand/nzealand.html| accessdate = 2007-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An aerial photographic survey of 50 glaciers in the South Island has been carried out for most years since 1977. The data was used to show that between 1976 and 2005 there was a 10% loss in glacier volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salinger|first=Jim|author2=Chinn, Trevor |author3=Willsman, Andrew |author4= Fitzharris, Blair |date=September 2008|title=Glacier response to climate change|journal=Water &amp; Atmosphere|volume=16|issue=3|issn=1172-1014|url=http://www.niwa.co.nz/news-and-publications/publications/all/wa/16-3/glacier|accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Cascade glacier mass balance program===
The North Cascade Glacier Climate Project measures the annual balance of 10 glaciers, more than any other program in North America, to monitor an entire glaciated mountain range, which was listed as a high priority of the National Academy of Sciences in 1983. These records extend from 1984–2008 and represent the only set of records documenting the mass balance changes of an entire glacier clad range.  North Cascade glaciers annual balance has averaged −0.48 m/a from 1984–2008, a cumulative thickness loss of over 13&amp;nbsp;m or 20–40% of their total volume since 1984 due to negative mass balances. The trend in mass balance is becoming more negative which is fueling more glacier retreat and thinning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pelto |first=Mauri |title=Glacier Mass Balance |work=North Cascade Glacier Climate Project |publisher= |date=November 9, 2006 |url=http://www.nichols.edu/departments/north%20cascade%20glacier%20mass%20balance.htm |accessdate=2009-06-09 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway mass balance program===
[[Norway]] maintains the most extensive mass balance program in the world and is largely funded by the hydropower industry.  Mass balance measurements are currently (2012) performed on fifteen glaciers in Norway. In southern Norway six of the glaciers have been measured continuously since 1963 or earlier, and they constitute a west-east profile reaching from the maritime Ålfotbreen Glacier, close to the western coast, to the continental Gråsubreen Glacier, in the eastern part of [[Jotunheimen]]. Storbreen Glacier in Jotunheimen has been measured for a longer period of time than any other glacier in Norway, starting in 1949, while Engabreen Glacier at Svartisen has the longest series in northern Norway (starting in 1970).  The Norwegian program is where the traditional methods of mass balance measurement were largely derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nve.no/en/Water/Hydrology/Glaciers/Glaciological-investigations-in-Norway/ | title=Mass balance measurements | work=Glaciological investigations in Norway | author1=Norwegian Water Resources | author2=Energy Directorate | date=March 28, 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928145338/http://www.nve.no/en/Water/Hydrology/Glaciers/Glaciological-investigations-in-Norway/ | archivedate=September 28, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden Storglaciären===
{{see also|Storglaciären}}
The [[Tarfala research station]] in the [[Kebnekaise]] region of northern [[Sweden]] is operated by [[Stockholm University]]. It was here that the first mass balance program was initiated immediately after [[World War II]], and continues to the present day. This survey was the initiation of the mass balance record of Storglaciären Glacier, and constitutes the longest continuous study of this type in the world.  Storglaciären has had a cumulative negative mass balance from 1946–2006 of −17 m. The program began monitoring the Rabots Glaciär in 1982, Riukojietna in 1985, and Mårmaglaciären in 1988.  All three of these glaciers have had a strong negative mass balance since initiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Storglaciären| website =| publisher =Stockholm University| date =February 9, 2003| url =http://www.ink.su.se/pub/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=4044&amp;a=13948| doi =| accessdate =2009-06-27| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070709073853/http://www.ink.su.se/pub/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=4044&amp;a=13948| archive-date =2007-07-09| dead-url =yes| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iceland Glacier mass balance===
Glacier mass balance is measured once or twice annually on numerous stakes on the several ice caps in Iceland by the National Energy Authority. Regular pit and stake mass-balance measurements have been carried out on the northern side of Hofsjökull since 1988 and likewise on the Þrándarjökull since 1991. Profiles of mass balance (pit and stake) have been established on the eastern and south-western side of Hofsjökull since 1989. Similar profiles have been assessed on the Tungnaárjökull, Dyngjujökull, Köldukvíslarjökull and Brúarjökull outlet glaciers of Vatnajökull since 1992 and the Eyjabakkajökull outlet glacier since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iceland |website= |publisher=Iceland National Energy Authority |year=2006 |url=http://www.os.is/cefiles/glacier/hofsjmbrepOS2006004.pdf |doi= |accessdate=2008-03-09 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100331000607/http%3A//www%2Eos%2Eis/cefiles/glacier/hofsjmbrepOS2006004%2Epdf |archivedate= March 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swiss mass balance program===
Temporal changes in the spatial distribution of the mass balance result primarily from changes in accumulation and melt along the surface. As a consequence, variations in the mass of glaciers reflect changes in climate and the energy fluxes at the Earth's surface.  The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] glaciers Gries in the central [[Alps]] and Silvretta in the eastern Alps, have been measured for many years. The distribution of seasonal accumulation and ablation rates are measured in-situ. Traditional field methods are combined with remote sensing techniques to track changes in mass, geometry and the flow behaviour of the two glaciers. These investigations contribute to the Swiss Glacier Monitoring Network and the International network of the [[World Glacier Monitoring Service]] (WGMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bauder |first=Andreas |author2=Martin Funk |title=Mass Balance Studies on Griesgletscher and Silvrettagletscher |work=The Swiss Glaciers |publisher=Laboratory of Hydraulics, Hydrology and Glaciology, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology |date=March 20, 2006 |url=http://www.vaw.ethz.ch/research/glaciology/glacier_change/gz_mass_balance_gries_silvrettaglacier |accessdate=2007-01-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231034357/http://www.vaw.ethz.ch/research/glaciology/glacier_change/gz_mass_balance_gries_silvrettaglacier |archivedate=2006-12-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States Geological Survey (USGS)===
The USGS operates a long-term "benchmark" glacier monitoring program which is used to examine climate change, glacier mass balance, [[glacier motion]], and stream runoff. This program has been ongoing since 1965 and has been examining three glaciers in particular. [[Gulkana Glacier]] in the [[Alaska Range]] and Wolverine Glacier in the [[Pacific Coast Ranges|Coast Ranges]] of [[Alaska]] have both been monitored since 1965, while the South Cascade Glacier in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] State has been continuously monitored since the [[International Geophysical Year]] of 1957.  This program monitors one glacier in each of these mountain ranges, collecting detailed data to understand glacier hydrology and glacier climate interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Benchmark Glaciers| work =Water Resources of Alaska-Glacier and Snow Program| publisher =United States Geological Survey| date =July 9, 2004| url =http://ak.water.usgs.gov/glaciology/| accessdate =2007-01-09| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070107171414/http://ak.water.usgs.gov/glaciology/| archive-date =2007-01-07| dead-url =yes| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geological Survey of Canada-Glaciology Section (GSC)===
The GSC operates Canada's Glacier-Climate Observing System as part of its Climate Change Geoscience Program.  With its University partners, it conducts monitoring and research on glacier-climate changes, water resources and sea level change using a network of reference observing sites located in the Cordillera and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.  This network is augmented with remote sensing assessments of regional glacier changes.  Sites in the Cordillera include the Helm, Place, Andrei, Kaskakwulsh, Haig, Peyto,  Ram River, Castle Creek, Kwadacha and Bologna Creek Glaciers; in the Arctic Archipelago include the White, Baby and Grise Glaciers and the Devon, Meighen, Melville and Agassiz Ice Caps.  GSC reference sites are monitored using the standard stake based glaciological method (stratigraphic) and periodic geodetic assessments using airborne lidar.

The Canadian Arctic White Glacier has not been as negative at (−6 m) since 1980.

===Bolivia mass balance network===
The glacier monitoring network in [[Bolivia]], a branch of the glacio-hydrological system of observation installed throughout the tropical [[Andes mountains]] by IRD and partners since 1991, has monitored mass balance on Zongo (6000 m asl), [[Chacaltaya]] (5400 m asl) and Charquini glaciers (5380 m asl).  A system of stakes has been used, with frequent field observations, as often as monthly.  These measurements have been made in concert with energy balance to identify the cause of the rapid retreat and mass balance loss of these tropical glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Benchmark Glaciers| work =Institute of Hydraulics and Hydrology of Bolivia| publisher =Bernard Francou, Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD| date =January 2001| url =http://www.ird.fr/us/actualites/fiches/2001/127.htm| accessdate =2008-03-09| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070819193748/http://www.ird.fr/us/actualites/fiches/2001/127.htm| archivedate =2007-08-19| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass balance in former USSR===
Nowadays, glaciological stations exist  in Russia and Kazakhstan.  In Russia there are 2 stations: Glacier Djankuat in Caucasus,is located near the mountain Elbrus, and Glacier Aktru in Altai Mountains. In Kazakhstan there is glaciological station in Glacier Tuyuk-Su, in Tian Shan, is located near the city of Almaty

===PTAA-Mass balance model===

A recently developed glacier balance model based on Monte Carlo principals is a promising supplement to both manual field measurements and geodetic methods of measuring mass balance using satellite images.  [[PTAA GMB Model|The PTAA (precipitation-temperature-area-altitude) model]] requires only daily observations of precipitation and temperature collected at usually low-altitude weather stations, and the area-altitude distribution of the glacier.&lt;ref name="TangbornWV97"&gt;Tangborn, W.V., [http://www.hymet.com/docs/columbiaglacier.pdf Using low-altitude meteorological observations to calculate the mass balance of Alaska’s Columbia Glacier and relate it to calving and speed.] Report of a Workshop, February 28 – March 2, 1997, Byrd Polar Research Center, Report No. 15. Retrieved 2016-09-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TangbornWV99"&gt;Tangborn, W.V., [http://www.ptaagmb.com/how-it-works.aspx#article A Mass Balance Model that Uses Low-altitude Meteorological Observations and the Area–Altitude Distribution of a Glacier], Geografiska Annaler: Series A, ''Physical Geography'', Volume 81, Issue 4, December 1999, Pages: 753–765. Retrieved 2016-09-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Output are daily snow accumulation (Bc) and ablation (Ba) for each altitude interval, which is converted to mass balance by Bn = Bc – Ba. Snow Accumulation (Bc) is calculated for each area-altitude interval based on observed precipitation at one or more lower altitude weather stations located in the same region as the glacier and three coefficients that convert precipitation to snow accumulation.  It is necessary to use established weather stations that have a long unbroken records so that annual means and other statistics can be determined.  Ablation (Ba) is determined from temperature observed at weather stations near the glacier.  Daily maximum and minimum temperatures are converted to glacier ablation using twelve coefficients.

The fifteen independent coefficients that are used to convert observed temperature and precipitation to ablation and snow accumulation apply a simplex optimizing procedure.  The simplex automatically and simultaneously calculates values for each coefficient using Monte Carlo principals that rely on random sampling to obtain numerical results. Similarly, the PTAA model makes repeated calculations of mass balance, minutely re-adjusting the balance for each iteration.

The PTAA model has been tested for eight glaciers in Alaska, Washington, Austria and Nepal. Calculated annual balances are compared with measured balances for approximately 60 years for each of five glaciers. The Wolverine and Gulkana in Alaska, Hintereisferner, Kesselwandferner and Vernagtferner in Austria. It has also been applied to the Langtang Glacier in Nepal. Results for these tests are shown on the GMB (glacier mass balance) website at [http://ptaagmb.com/ ptaagmb.com.] Linear regressions of model versus manual balance measurements are based on a split-sample approach so that the calculated mass balances are independent of the temperature and precipitation used to calculate the mass balance.
 
Regression of model versus measured annual balances yield R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; values of 0.50 to 0.60. Application of the model to Bering Glacier in Alaska demonstrated a close agreement with ice volume loss for the 1972–2003 period measured with the geodetic method. Determining the mass balance and runoff of the partially debris-covered Langtang Glacier in Nepal demonstrates an application of this model to a glacier in the [[Himalayan Range]].&lt;ref name="TangbornRana2000"&gt;Tangborn, W.V. and Rana, B., 2000, [http://www.hymet.com/docs/langtang.pdf Mass Balance and Runoff of the Partially Debris-Covered Langtang Glacier, Nepal], presented as Debris-Covered Glaciers, Edited by M. Nakawa, C.F. Raymond, &amp; A. Fountain, IAHS Publication 264. Retrieved 2016-09-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Correlation between ablation of glaciers in the Wrangell Range in Alaska and global temperatures observed at 7000 weather stations in the Northern Hemisphere indicates that glaciers are more sensitive to the global climate than are individual temperature stations, which do not show similar correlations.&lt;ref name="TangbornWV2013"&gt;Tangborn, W.V., [http://www.the-cryosphere.net/7/867/2013/tc-7-867-2013.pdf Mass Balance, Runoff and Surges of Bering Glacier, Alaska].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8590">'''Global administrative law''' is an emerging field that is based upon a dual insight: that much of what is usually termed “[[global governance]]” can be accurately characterized as administrative action; and that increasingly such action is itself being regulated by [[administrative law]]-type principles, rules and mechanisms – in particular those relating to participation, transparency, accountability and review.&lt;ref&gt;See www.iilj.org/GAL/default.asp&lt;/ref&gt; GAL, then, refers to the structures, procedures and normative standards for regulatory decision-making including [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], [[Participation (decision making)|participation]], and review, and the rule-governed mechanisms for implementing these standards, that are applicable to formal intergovernmental regulatory bodies; to informal intergovernmental [[Regulation|regulatory]] networks; to regulatory decisions of national governments where these are part of or constrained by an international intergovernmental regime; and to hybrid public-private or private transnational bodies. The focus of this field is not the specific content of substantive rules, but rather the operation of existing or possible principles, procedural rules and reviewing and other mechanisms relating to accountability, transparency, participation, and assurance of legality in global governance.&lt;ref&gt;See www.irpa.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Today almost all human activity is subject to some form of global regulation. Goods and activities that are beyond the effective control of any one State are regulated at the global level. Global regulatory regimes cover a vast array of different subject-areas, including [[forest]] preservation, the control of [[fishing]], water regulation, [[environmental protection]], [[arms control]], [[food safety]] and standardization, financial and accounting standards, [[internet governance]], pharmaceuticals regulation, intellectual property protection, refugee protection, coffee and cocoa standards, labour standards, antitrust regulation, to name but a very few.
This increase in the number and scope of regulatory regimes has been matched by the huge growth of international organizations: nowadays over 2,000 [[intergovernmental organization]]s (IGO) and around 40,000 [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGO) are operating worldwide.

There are, of course, great differences among the various different types of regulatory regimes. Some merely provide a framework for State action, whereas others establish guidelines addressed to domestic administrative agencies, and others still impact directly upon national civil society actors. Some regulatory regimes create their own implementation mechanisms, while others rely on national or regional authorities for this task. To settle disputes, some regulatory regimes have established [[Judiciary|judicial]] (or quasi-judicial) bodies, or refer to those of different regimes; while others resort to “softer” forms, such as negotiation. Within this framework, the traditional mechanisms based on State consent as expressed through [[Treaty|treaties]] or custom are simply no longer capable of accounting for all global activities.

A new regulatory space is emerging, distinct from that of inter-State relations, transcending the sphere of influence of both [[international law]] and domestic administrative law: this can be defined as the global administrative space. IOs have become much more than instruments of the governments of their Member States; rather, they set their own norms and regulate their field of activity; they generate and follow their own, particular legal proceedings; and they can grant participatory rights to subjects, both public and private, affected by their activities. Ultimately, they have emerged as genuine global public administrations.&lt;ref&gt;Sabino CASSESE, “Administrative Law without the State? The Challenge of Global Regulation”, 37 ''New York University Journal of International Law and Politics'' 663 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, the structures, procedures and normative standards for regulatory decision-making applicable to global institutions (including transparency, participation, and review), and the rule-governed mechanisms for implementing these standards are coming to form a specific field of legal theory and practice: that of global administrative law. The main focus of this emerging field is not the particular content of substantive rules generated by global regulatory institutions, but rather the actual or potential application of principles, procedural rules and reviewing and other mechanisms relating to accountability, transparency, participation, and the rule of law in global governance.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict KINGSBURY, Nico KRISCH and Richard B. STEWART, "The Emergence of Global Administrative Law", 68 ''Law and Contemporary Problems'' 15 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Skagen aka the skaw northmost point of denmark 6th may 2006.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Grenen beach, 2006]]
[[File:Grenen.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Grenen seen from the south.]]

==Overview==
''Grenen'' (The Branch) was named for its shape like a tree-branch, reaching out from the mainland. The beach of Grenen appears in many of the works of the [[Skagen Painters]], a community that gathered there every summer between 1875 and the end of the 19th century. The area is also home to the [[Skagen Odde Nature Centre]], designed by [[Jørn Utzon]].

Near the tip of the spit are two small museums: [[Skagen Bunker Museum]] and [[Grenens Kunstmuseum]]. [[Danish national road 40]] passes through Grenen, and it is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country, with approximately 2 million visitors each year.

==Nature==
Grenen marks the junction between the [[strait]] of [[Skagerrak]] (part of the [[North Sea]]) and the [[Kattegat]] sea, and the turbulent colliding seas have created a 4-km long curved [[sandbar]] above and below the waves stretching east. The reef is still active and has grown about 1 km northeast towards [[Sweden]] over the last century, resulting in a [[mean]] annual growth rate of about 10 m. Because of the very strong currents, swimming there can be fatal and is prohibited in the waters around Grenen. 

The area surrounding Grenen is the place with the greatest number of observed bird species in all of Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birdsontop.dk/fuglestationen.html Skagen Bird Observatory] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birdwatchers regard it as the best spot in [[Northern Europe]], for observing [[birds of prey]] during their spring [[Bird migration|migrations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fatbirder.com/links_geo/europe/denmark.html Birding... Denmark] Fatbirder&lt;/ref&gt; Birds often gather here before crossing the seas to [[Bohuslän]] in [[Sweden]]. There are more migratory birds near Grenen when the wind is from the south-east. If the wind is from the south-west, many birds choose a route across [[Funen]] and [[Zealand]] instead. The annual Skagen Birding Festival has been celebrated here since 2005, attracting more than a thousand visitors and participants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birdsontop.dk/sff/english.html Skagen Bird Festival]&lt;/ref&gt;

Grenen is also one of the best places in Denmark to observe [[sea mammals]]. [[Porpoise]]s and [[common seal]]s are very common here, and [[grey seal]]s can be spotted here year round as well. As the area attracts many birdwatchers with binoculars, Grenen has also offered many whale sightings. The species most often reported are [[dolphins]] (especially [[white-beaked dolphin]]s), [[northern minke whale]] and [[orcas]]. There have been isolated reports from Grenen of more exotic animals like [[walrus]], [[hooded seal]], etc..&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fugleognatur.dk/lokalitet.asp?mode=unik&amp;ID=5657 List of species at Grenen] Fugle &amp; Natur {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scientists view Grenen as a laboratory on both [[Geomorphology|land formation]] and [[botany]], as new land is continuously being formed and shaped here, soon to be colonized by pioneering [[flora]].{{according to whom?|date=August 2017}}

== History ==
Sailors long feared Grenen, as many ships have run aground on the shallow reef through history. The first light signals was erected in 1561 on orders from King [[Frederick II of Denmark|Frederik II]] after international pressure. It was not very effective and was not regularly attended, so from 1627 [[Skagen's Vippefyr]], a coal- and wood-fired [[vippefyr|tipping lantern]], replaced it until 1747, when [[Skagen's White Lighthouse]] was built. The 44-metre high [[Skagen's Grey Lighthouse]] has done the job since 1858, and in 1956 the 26-metre tall [[Skagen's West Lighthouse]] was added, making the heavy traffic in and out of [[Kattegat]] adequately safe.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The '''International Cyanide Management Code For The Manufacture, Transport and Use of Cyanide In The Production of Gold''', commonly referred to as the '''Cyanide Code'''  is a voluntary program designed to assist the global gold mining industry and the producers and transporters of cyanide used in gold mining in improving cyanide management practices, and to publicly demonstrate their compliance with the Cyanide Code through an independent and transparent process. The Cyanide Code is intended to reduce the potential exposure of workers and communities to harmful concentrations of cyanide‚ to limit releases of cyanide to the environment‚ and to enhance response actions in the event of an exposure or release.

The Cyanide Code was one of the earliest standards and certification programs  developed for the minerals sector. Today, it is amongst the most established certification programs in the mining industry.

==Cyanide in gold mining==

Cyanide is a general term for a group of chemicals containing carbon and nitrogen. Cyanide compounds include both naturally occurring and human-made chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static1.squarespace.com/static/516c6bb1e4b0e4e26c1d8e53/t/51b9546ae4b003975d41bbca/1371100266892/ICMMCY~1.PDF

	In nature, cyanide is present naturally in plants including bitter almonds apples, peaches, apricots, lima beans, barley, sorghum, flaxseed and bamboo shoots. Some scientists suggest that the reason why these plants contain cyanide, which can be toxic, is that evolution has designed them to discourage insects from feasting on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	Although cyanide can be toxic to humans, eating cyanide-containing foods generally is not harmful because cyanide is present in very low amounts, is often contained in seeds which are discarded, or is washed away when the food is prepared. 
	Cyanide can be acutely toxic to humans, other mammals and aquatic species, as it interferes with oxygen utilization. Cyanide does not bioaccumulate, and a non-lethal dose is metabolized in the body.  Cyanide is not carcinogenic, teratogenic or mutagenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

	Cyanide comes in many forms including hydrogen cyanide (HCN), cyanogen chloride (CNCl),  and salts such as sodium cyanide (NaCN) or potassium cyanide (KCN). In manufacturing, cyanide is used to make paper, textiles, and plastics. Cyanide salts are used in metallurgy for electroplating, metal cleaning, and removing gold from its ore. Cyanide gas is used to exterminate pests and vermin in ships and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

	Cyanide is a basic building block for the chemical industry. About 80% of global cyanide production is used to synthesize a wide range of industrial organic chemicals such as nylon and acrylics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://static1.squarespace.com/static/516c6bb1e4b0e4e26c1d8e53/t/51b9546ae4b003975d41bbca/1371100266892/ICMMCY~1.PDF

	It is estimated that less than 20% of manufactured cyanide is used in mineral processing in the form of sodium cyanide. Sodium cyanide has been used in gold mining since 1887 because it is one of only a few chemical reagents that will dissolve gold in water. This allows the efficient extraction of gold from low grade ore. Commercial gold mining operations use very dilute solutions of sodium cyanide, typically in the range of 0.01% and 0.05% cyanide (100 to 500 parts per million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://static1.squarespace.com/static/516c6bb1e4b0e4e26c1d8e53/t/51b9546ae4b003975d41bbca/1371100266892/ICMMCY~1.PDF

Cyanide should be strictly controlled on mine sites, and proper management requires that certain precautions be taken to limit worker exposure and to prevent chemical solutions containing cyanide from entering the environment.  
The most-used process of removing gold from ore is through leaching. In the leaching process, sodium cyanide is dissolved in water where, under mildly oxidizing conditions, it dissolves the gold contained in the crushed gold ore. The resultant gold-bearing solution is called 'pregnant solution.'  Either zinc metal or activated carbon is then added to the pregnant solution to recover the gold by removing it from the solution. 
There are two main leaching methods for gold extraction using cyanide. The first is 'heap' leaching in which the dilute cyanide solution is sprayed on large piles or heaps of coarse gold ore. The solution percolates through the pile dissolving the gold and the pregnant solution is then collected. This method is mainly used for ore with lower concentrations of gold. The other method is 'vat' leaching in which the process is similar but the gold ore is finely ground and leaching takes place in a tank or vat. Vat leaching is used mainly for ores with higher concentrations of gold due to the cost of milling the ore to a very small particle size. 
Alternative lixiviant (leaching) chemicals to cyanide (for example thiourea, sodium bromide) have been investigated for many years, but they are generally less effective and/or economical than cyanide, and they also present environmental risks that can be greater than cyanide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cyanide Code grew out of the first-of-its-kind workshop of multi-stakeholders held in Paris in May, 2000 convened to consider developing a code of best practice for the use of cyanide in [[gold mining]] in response to a tailings spill from the Aural Mine at [[Baia Mare]] in Romania&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in January 2000. The meeting was co-hosted by [[The United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the International Council on Metals and the Environment (now the [[International Council on Mining and Metals]]). Workshop participants were almost 40 representatives of such diverse organizations as the [[Worldwide Fund for Nature]], the Mineral Policy Center (now Earthworks), the Sierra Club, and the [[World Gold Council]], along with representation from the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], the governments of Australia, France, Hungary, Romania, and the world’s leading gold producers and cyanide producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=Ecole des Mines, Paris, France
|accessdate=
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the workshop, a multi-stakeholder steering committee was established to oversee development of a code of best practice for the management of cyanide used for gold recovery. The committee met five times over a 13-month period starting in late 2000, and each successive draft of the best practice document it produced was made available to the public on the UNEP web site with an open invitation for comments.  The committee also solicited comments directly from 140 groups and individuals, including governments, NGOs, academics, consultants, industry, and financial institutions, and received 68 written responses and 15 stakeholder presentations at its meetings. In early 2002, the committee completed the ''International Cyanide Management Code for The Manufacture, Transport and Use of Cyanide In The Production of Gold''.

As conceived by the steering committee, the Cyanide Code was more than a guide to best management practices for the use of cyanide in the production of gold. The Cyanide Code also addressed the safe manufacture and transport of the cyanide used in the gold industry. Further, although the program is voluntary, the Cyanide Code includes a process by which its implementation at gold mines and other facilities is verified by independent third-party professional auditors and audit results are made available to the public. The International Cyanide Management Institute (ICMI) was established in 2003 to oversee the Cyanide Code’s implementation and verification, and by 2005, the administrative procedures, audit protocols and guidance documents necessary for full program implementation had been developed.

2015 marked the tenth year of implementation of the Cyanide Code globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the International Cyanide Management Institute undertook a public consultation process to determine if the Cyanide Code should be extended to include primary silver mines, which is defined as an operation where silver is the main commodity produced. About 30% of the world’s silver production comes from primary silver mines; the balance is produced as a co-product from polymetallic, base metal, or gold mines. The Institute solicited input from stakeholders on the proposal, including its advisability, policy or technical issues, and any other related matters. Following receipt of stakeholder comments, all of which were supportive of the change, ICMI’s Board of Directors approved the program’s expansion, effective January 1, 2017.

==Signatories and certification==

The Cyanide Code is a resource for any gold mine, cyanide producer or cyanide transporter regarding best practices for cyanide management. A company that becomes a signatory to the Cyanide Code commits to implement its Principles and Standards of Practice at its operations and to demonstrate compliance by having their facilities audited against the Cyanide Code’s Verification Protocols.

The first 14 Cyanide Code signatory companies were announced in November 2005. Over the past eight years, the number of companies participating in the program has substantially increased. As of January 1, 2018, the Cyanide Code had 195 signatory companies, with operations in 54 countries. These include 47 gold mining companies, 23 cyanide producers, and 125 cyanide transporters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The initial audit must be conducted within three years of the facility’s owner becoming a signatory, and audits to evaluate continuing compliance are conducted on a three-year interval. Operations are certified in compliance with the Cyanide Code based on the auditors’ findings, and a summary of the audit results, as well as the credentials of the auditors, are made available to the public on the Cyanide Code web site.
The program’s transparency gives stakeholders the ability to judge the rigor of the audit process and the audit findings.

==Stakeholder perspectives==

The Cyanide Code has been recognized by the [[Group of Eight]] ("G8") as one of several certification systems that are suitable instruments for "increasing transparency and good governance in the extraction and processing of mineral raw materials."  The G8 is an international forum for the governments of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States.  Article 85 of the G8’s Summit Declaration, issued during its 2007 annual meeting, states the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Certification systems can be a suitable instrument in appropriate cases for increasing transparency and good governance in the extraction and processing of mineral raw materials and to reduce environmental impacts, support the compliance with minimum social standards and resolutely counter illegal resource extraction. Therefore, we reaffirm our support for existing initiatives such as … the International Cyanide Management Code, and encourage the adaptation of the respective principles of corporate social responsibility by those involved in the extraction and processing of mineral resources,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC), a part of the [[World Bank]] that provides funding for mining projects, applies the Cyanide Code in lieu of its own requirements in its ''Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines for Mining''. As a condition of its loans, IFC EHS Guidelines call on mines to use cyanide in a manner "consistent with the principles and standards of practice of the International Cyanide Management Code."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Environment Canada’s "Environmental Code of Practice for Metal Mines" cites the Cyanide Code as the guide for the environmentally responsible management of cyanide used in the production of both gold and base metals, and recommends that cyanide management planning and the transportation, storage, use and disposal of cyanide and cyanide-related materials be done "in a manner consistent with practices described in the International Cyanide Management Code."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Study also noted the Cyanide Code offers "rigorous and transparent verification of compliance, that there is "respect for the Code by operational staff and excellent emergency procedures."

In a May 2013 report titled ''More Substance Than Shine'', several NGOs including Earthworks, [[MiningWatch Canada]], and [[United Steelworkers]] noted that the International Cyanide Management Code is an example of a certification or monitoring system that
provides audit information to the public. "For example, the following documents are available online: Auditor summary reports; Auditor Credential forms; Corrective Action Completion forms showing that those that did not obtain full compliance carried out the corrective actions necessary to obtain certification. Auditor summary reports also provide the basis for the findings or deficiencies identified during the audit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In commenting on the stringent auditing process, a report titled ''Global Best Practices in Cyanide Management: The International Cyanide Management Code (ICMC) and Turkish Experience'' noted: "In summary, the ICMC is one of the most rigorous voluntary auditing benchmarks ever to be applied in any international industry. ICMC auditing protocols are exacting, detailed, and transparent, and third party auditors are held to a very high standard with  respect to their independence, auditing capabilities, and technical experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Mining Certification Evaluation Project's final report concluded that "third party certification schemes offer a credible means with which to assess and verify performance against agreed standards", and noted that "the Cyanide Code is a prominent example of an existing third-party certification scheme for the mining industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In an article in the Canadian Institute of ''Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum'' May, 2015 magazine Kinross Gold Corporation’s Vice President of Environmental Affairs, Dean Williams, concurred saying that the Cyanide Code has become the new industry standard. “Any responsible gold miner of any size that elects not to become certified is actually making a statement that is contrary to most of the industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) is developing a system of best practice standards aimed at improving mining operations' social and environmental performance, with a goal of certifying mine sites in 2015. In developing its system, IRMA is building on the work of other initiatives including the Cyanide Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

By adopting standards and practices that exceed state-imposed regulations and laws, the mining industry and financing institutions, provide an additional source of protection for indigenous and local communities. As a result, their institutional policies may strengthen the ability of developing nations to demand higher standards which would benefit these communities. Support for industry codes, such as the International Cyanide Management Code, could relieve some pressure on developing nations to maintain lower standards to attract foreign investment, according to Christine R. Thompson, writing in the ''Suffolk Transnational Law Review.'' "The Code's Principles and Standards of Practice would apply regardless of the state's regulatory environment. The Code's third-party audits guarantee uniform compliance, an aspect lacking in other voluntary measures such as the U.N. Global Compact. Wide adoption of voluntary standards might make them binding and applicable to all, regardless of whether state regulations are less stringent or protective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The United National Environment Programme (UNEP) has described ICMI as a partner in its efforts to promote emergency preparedness.  In UNEP's 2012 publication "Commemorating 25 Years of Awareness and Preparedness for Emergencies at Local Level (APELL),"  it stated that the Cyanide Code is "consistent with the APELL framework and its ten-step process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals &amp; Chemicals Importers &amp; Exporters,’ a national industry association officially affiliated with China’s Ministry of Commerce, released their first industry specific guidance on social responsibility for China’s mining industry. Their  “Guidelines for Social Responsibility in Outbound Mining Investment” requires Chinese mining companies to include social and environmental factors into their management plans for overseas operations, and specifically encourages that mining operations using cyanide be certified in compliance with the Cyanide Code.

In the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]ian epic [[Enuma Elish]], '''Kishar''' is the daughter of [[Lahmu]] and [[Lahamu]], the first children of [[Tiamat]] and [[Abzu]]. She is the female principle, sister and wife of [[Anshar]], the male principle, and the mother of [[Anu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/anarandkiar/|title=Anšar and Kišar (god and goddess)|last=Brisch|first=Nicole|date=2012|website=Ancient Mesopotamian Gods and Goddesses|publisher=Oracc and the UK Higher Education Academy|accessdate=19 June 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kishar may represent the earth as a counterpart to Anshar, the sky,&lt;ref&gt;Black, Jeremy and Anthony Green, 1992.

Her name also means "Whole Earth". 

Kishar appears only once in Enuma Elish, in the opening lines of the epic, and then disappears from the remainder of the story.  She appears only occasionally in other first millennium BCE texts, where she can be equated with the goddess [[Antu (goddess)|Antu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/anarandkiar/|title=Anšar and Kišar (god and goddess)|last=Brisch|first=Nicole|date=2012|website=Ancient Mesopotamian Gods and Goddesses|publisher=Oracc and the UK Higher Education Academy|accessdate=19 June 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Korea Aerospace University''' (한국항공대학교 (韓國航空大學校) [Han’guk Hang-gong Dae-hak-gyo]) is a private university in [[Goyang]], [[Gyeonggi Province|Gyeonggi]], [[South Korea]]. Established in 1952 as a national university, it was taken over by Jungseok Foundation established by Hanjin Group and transferred to a private university. The university — which encompasses most of the aerospace fields including Aerospace &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Electronics, Telecommunications, Computer Engineering, Air Transportation and Logistics, Aeronautical Science &amp; Flight Operation, and Air and Space Law — has been designated to take several national undertakings and collaborative research projects with prominent global corporations including GE, Airbus, PLANSEE since 2009.

Major research results have been observed in the realm of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), since the first autonomous formation flight of UAV and the first flight of solar powered UAV for 12 consecutive hours in Korea. ‘The 1st Hannuri’, the micro satellite (CubeSat), was developed and launched for the first time among Korean universities in 2006.

== History ==
[[File:KAU 60th anniversary.jpg|thumb|left|60th anniversary]]

=== Beginnings (1950s~1960s) ===
Korea Aerospace University was established as a national school in June 16, 1952, when the Korean War was raged, under the Charter for Transport School which was granted by the Ministry of Transportation (which is now Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs) to develop a civil aviation industry. Although the university primarily started as a two-year course school solely with three departments — Department of Flight Operation, Department of Aircraft Power, Department of Telecommunication Engineering — its status had been elevated by 1953.

After the War, the campus moved to Seoul in 1962, then to Goyang City, Gyeonggi-do in 1963, where it is today. School buildings were built (the Hangar, the Flight Training Center, and the Electronics &amp; Telecommunication Building) and several institutes (the Central Library, the Maintenance Factory, the Wireless Lab, the Aviation Research Institute, the Training School for Aviation Tech) were opened.

=== Strengthened (1970s~1990s) ===
In 1979, the university was taken over by Jungseok Foundation, established by Hanjin Group, and it was transferred to a private university. Ever since the transformation, the university started to strengthen its inner and outer sides.

Through the modifications on quota and name, establishment of schools, departments, and graduate schools were finalized. Auxiliary organizations and institutes were reorganized (see “Centers and institutes”) to vitalize its inner strength.

For the latter, the Liberal Arts Building, Central Library, the Aviation Control Center, the Mechanical Engineering Building, and the Flight Operation Building were opened in 1970s; the Student’s Hall, the Science Building, the Mechanical Engineering Building, the Electronic Engineering Building were constructed in 1990s. Most of the structures were completed through this period.

=== Development (2000s~ ) ===
Passing through the strengthening period, the university started to focus on ensuring its internal stability. From the early 2000s, structures were added and expanded. The Central Library, the Center for Technical Assiatance to Small and Medium-sized Industries, the KAU Aerospace Center/Museum, and the New Administrative Building were built. The Library and the Student’s Hall had a level extension.

The university changed its name from Hankuk Aviation University to Korea Aerospace University in 2007. It started to develop its competence by expanding international networks. After obtaining AABI (Aviation Accreditation Board International) qualification, for flight education, aviation management, air traffic management, and air transportation systems in 2007, MOUs (memoranda of understanding) and agreements with well-known organizations were concluded: MOUs with University of Southern California, Drexel University, Oregon State University; agreement for cooperation with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University; joint development agreement with General Electric.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8601">'''Lakawood''', or '''laka wood'''  ({{lang-ms|kayu laka}}), is a reddish aromatic [[heartwood]] used as incense in China, India and South East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=niwsBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA246&amp;lpg=PA246#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Cultural History of Plants |editors= Sir Ghillean Prance, Mark Nesbitt |page=246 |date=2005 |publisher= Routledge|isbn=9780415927468 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also had a number of other uses in the past, for example as a dye and for medicinal purposes. The name lakawood has been used to refer to the wood of different plants, such as ''[[Acronychia pedunculata]]'', ''A. Laurifolia'', and in particular, ''[[Dalbergia|Dalbergia parviflora]]'' found in South East Asia. Historically it was one of the most commonly-traded commodities of South East Asia in the trade between China and South East Asia from the [[Song dynasty]] onwards, possibly earlier.&lt;ref name="JSEAS"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=20072321|title=The Trade in Lakawood Products between South China and the Malay World from the Twelfth to Fifteenth Centuries AD |author=Derek Heng Thiam Soon|journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|volume= 32|issue= 2 |date=June 2001|pages= 133–149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="needham"/&gt;

==Names==
The lakawood of ''Dalbergia parviflora'' is a product of the [[Malay peninsula]] and [[Malay archipelago|archipelago]], and its native name in Malay is ''kayu laka'' (literally "laka wood"), from which the words cayolaque and lakawood are derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DjQ9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Ying-Yai Sheng-Lan: 'The Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores' (1433) |authors= Huan Ma, Chengjun Feng |page=81 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2 December 1970|isbn= 978-0521010320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In old Javanese literature, the word ''"laka"'' was also used to denote a shade of red on cloth, and the word ''manglaka'' meant "processor of laka-wood dye", although the tree from which the dye was derived from is ''[[Emblica officinalis]]''.&lt;ref name="JSEAS"/&gt;

In Chinese, lakawood may be called ''jiangzhenxiang'' (降真香) or ''zitengxiang'' (紫藤香). The two names referred to different types of fragrant wood in the early period, but by the early 13th century, the two names were regarded as referring to the same product.&lt;ref name="mair"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LgGhCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA224#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Imperial China and Its Southern Neighbours |authors= Victor H Mair, Liam Kelley |pages=222–228 |publisher=ISEAS Publishing |date=30 September 2015|isbn= 978-9814620536 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The older term ''ziteng'' (紫藤, literally "purple vine") has been identified as a plant grown in Southern China ''[[Acronychia pedunculata]]'' and ''A. Laurifolia'', but is distinct from [[wisteria]] which also has the same Chinese name.&lt;ref name="mair"/&gt; The fragrance and appearance of the heartwood and root wood from ''Dalbergia parviflora'' of South East Asia, known to have been imported into China in the 10th century, is similar to the earlier Chinese incense wood, it therefore became a substitute for the Chinese product.&lt;ref name="mair"/&gt; Its fragrance was particularly appreciated by [[Taoist]]s, and it therefore gained the name ''jiangzhenxiang'' meaning "the incense that summons the Perfected Ones to descend among us".&lt;ref name="needham"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hiGuQyCSQ_cC&amp;pg=RA1-PA141#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 5, Issue 2|author= Joseph Needham |page=141 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=27 September 1974 |isbn=978-0521085717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historical records however used two similar terms, ''jiangzhenxiang'' and ''jiangzhen'', which may have been two different products.&lt;ref name="JSEAS"/&gt; 
Lakawood was also once referred to as ''Tanarius major'' in some English sources.&lt;ref name="li"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yOk1cNU4niIC&amp;pg=PA428#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Chinese Medicinal Herbs: A Modern Edition of a Classic Sixteenth-century Manual |authors= Shizhen Li, Porter Smith, George Arthur Stuart |page=428 |publisher=Dover Publications Inc.|date=27 January 2003|isbn=978-0486428017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The wood has been used as [[incense in China]] from an early period, and it was said to be particularly favoured by the Taoists.&lt;ref name="schafer"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=glZODQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT342&amp;lpg=PT342#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of T’ang Exotics |author= Edward H. Schafer |publisher=Pickle Partners Publishing |date=21 October 2016|asin=B01MFCKG5W }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is powdered and mixed with other substances to make incense, commonly in the form of [[joss stick]]s.  It was first mentioned in 304 AD as a preservative in wine and an incense wood for the summoning of spirit.&lt;ref name="mair"/&gt;  During the Tang dynasty, it was used for magical and medicinal purposes, burnt in home to rid of all that's "weird and strange", and pieces of the wood were attached to children to ward off "evil vapours".&lt;ref name="schafer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aW6V2zKcMCUC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Dragon's Brain Perfume: An Historical Geography of Camphor|author= R. A. Donkin |page=12 |publisher=Brill |date=18 December 1998|isbn= 978-9004109834 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to 16th century herbologist and doctor [[Li Shizhen]], it was also used "as an [[astringent]], as a wash to cleanse sores and to excite [[Granulation tissue|granulations]], and as a deodorizing and disinfecting agent."&lt;ref name="li"/&gt;  The sap of ''Emblica officinalis'', also called laka, was used as a red dye by people of Java and the [[Malacca Strait]] area.&lt;ref name="mair"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JSEAS"/&gt;  According to ''Zhu Fan Zhi'', the red-coloured sap of lakawood was also once used as an ingredient in a product called "imitation [[Dracaena cinnabari|dragon's blood]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chau Ju-kua: His Work On The Chinese And Arab Trade In The Twelfth And Thirteenth Centuries, Entitled Chu-fan-chï |author=  Friedrich Hirth, William Woodville Rockhill |url= https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023289345#page/n213/mode/2up/ |page=198 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical records==
''Ziteng'' was first described in 304 AD in a book on plants, ''[[Nanfang Caomu Zhuang]]'' (''Plants of the Southern Regions'') written by Ji Han, as having long and slender leaves, white flower and black seed. Its wood was chopped up and used as incense.&lt;ref name="JSEAS"/&gt; The 9th century Tang poet Cao Tang (曹唐) wrote a poem on a Taoist theme that refers to the lakawood ''jiangzhenxiang'': "Reddish dew gives me an image of upturning "the wine which extends life", Whitish smoke puts me in mind of burning "''jiangzhenxiang''" ("the aromatic which brings down the True Ones")".&lt;ref name="schafer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gushiwen.org/wen_1747.aspx |title=曹唐的诗 |work= 古诗文网 }} Original text: 红露想倾延命酒，素烟思爇降真香。&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakawood from South East Asia was first noted in 982 (early Song dynasty) as one of the 37 foreign products that can be freely traded in China, and descriptions of the trade and product are given in accounts from the Sung and Yuan dynasty, ''[[Zhu Fan Zhi]]'' and ''[[Daoyi Zhilüe]]''.&lt;ref name="mair"/&gt; These texts indicate that Lakawood was a product of various states in the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Singapore]], [[Sumatra]], [[Java]], as well as [[Borneo]]. They suggest a significant trade in lakawood, but it was also regarded as a cheap import during the Song dynasty, such that people of [[Quanzhou]] be they rich or poor can afford to buy the incense to burn at the end of the year as a sacrifice to Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chau Ju-kua: His Work On The Chinese And Arab Trade In The Twelfth And Thirteenth Centuries, Entitled Chu-fan-chï |author=  Friedrich Hirth, William Woodville Rockhill |url= https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023289345#page/n225/mode/2up/ |page=211 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lambri]] in Sumatra was mentioned as producing the best quality lakawood. The value of lakawood however increased during the Ming dynasty.  The product was mentioned in accounts of [[Zheng He]]'s voyages such ''[[Yingya Shenglan]]'' by [[Ma Huan]] during the Ming dynasty, and its value was considered high enough to be presented to the imperial court as tributes by various ports of Sumatra as well as [[Siam]].&lt;ref name="mair"/&gt;

== Incidents ==

This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. '''For natural gas alone''', the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987.

A "significant incident" results in any of the following consequences:
* fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization
* $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars
* liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel)
* releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion

PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are repurposed to carry different products.&lt;ref&gt;Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10. PHMSA Corrective Action Orders are at https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/CAO_opid_0.html. PHMSA Pipeline Failure Investigation Reports are at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/safety-reports/pipeline-failure-investigation-reports. NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In January, a Mid-Valley owned and Sunoco operated pipeline ruptured, spilling {{convert|260,000|USgal|L}} of oil into the Kentucky and Ohio rivers. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fined the companies $2.5&amp;nbsp;million for the spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2006/August/06_enrd_534.html |title=Federal Government Reaches Settlement with Pipeline Companies Regarding Crude Oil Spills |publisher=Justice.gov |date=August 15, 2006 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713232646/http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2006/August/06_enrd_534.html |archivedate=July 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 18, an [[Enbridge]] pipeline failed from temperature problems, causing a spill of 100 barrels of crude oil in [[Bay City, Michigan]]. The pipe was just two years old at the time.&lt;ref name="addictinginfo.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.addictinginfo.org/2013/07/17/fighting-fossil-fuel-in-michigan-inside-the-pipeline-chris-wahmhoff-story-part-2/#ixzz2ZIsftiAy |title=Addicting Info |work=Addicting Info |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103192408/http://www.addictinginfo.org/2013/07/17/fighting-fossil-fuel-in-michigan-inside-the-pipeline-chris-wahmhoff-story-part-2/ |archivedate=November 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/271629 |title=Jan. 18, 2005 – ProPublica |publisher= |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020210642/http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/271629 |archivedate=October 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 26, a Mid Valley 22-inch pipeline ruptured in [[Carrollton, Kentucky]], spilling about 290,000 gallons of crude oil. Some of the crude entered the [[Ohio River]]. The pipe failure was caused by earth movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/271636 |title=Jan. 26, 2005 – ProPublica |publisher= |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809050248/http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/271636 |archivedate=August 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=266&amp;dat=20050201&amp;id=-_grAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EW0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1201,2550921|title=Kentucky New Era – Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On February 1, an [[ExxonMobil]] gasoline pipeline fire forced 43 families from their houses near [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]. The fire burned for over 72 hours. There were no reported injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firehouse.com/news/news/pennsylvania-pile-line-fire-finally-dies-out |title=Pennsylvania Pile Line Fire Finally Dies Out |publisher=Firehouse |date=February 5, 2005 |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No. 1-2005-5002H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/120055002H/120055002h_amendment%20to%20corrective%20action%20order_02102005_text.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225104849/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/120055002H/120055002h_amendment%20to%20corrective%20action%20order_02102005_text.pdf |archivedate=February 25, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On or about February 28, 2005, approximately 2,497 barrels of Jet A Kerosene discharged from a 14-inch TEPPCO pipeline, reaching the [[Big Cow Creek]], flowing into the [[Sabine River (Texas–Louisiana)|Sabine River]], near [[Newton, Texas]]. The discharge was caused by the over-tightening of a coupling at a 3/8-inch cooling line at the top of a 14-inch mainline pump.&lt;ref name="www2.epa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2013-09/documents/teppco-cd.pdf |format=PDF |title=United States v TE Products Pipeline Company |website=Epa.gov |accessdate=January 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304095159/http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2013-09/documents/teppco-cd.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 15, 2005, the [[Kinder Morgan]] Tejas pipeline at [[Nacogdoches, Texas]], had a “significant event” due to incorrect operation.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;“Texas Significant Incidents Listing,” 2003-2014, PHMSA Pipeline Safety Stakeholder Communication, U.S. DOT, http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/safety/IncDetSt_st_TX_flt_sig.html?nocache=8751, accessed June 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 16, a crew installing a communications cable nicked a gas distribution pipeline in [[Moon Township, Pennsylvania]]. The crew then notified the local One Call center, but failed to alert first responders. two hours after the nick, gas exploded in a house, burning two teenagers there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&amp;dat=20050616&amp;id=7L8iAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=E7YFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4236,4341778|title=Beaver County Times – Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On April 1, a [[Kinder Morgan Energy Partners]] petroleum products pipeline leaked gasoline near [[Truckee, California]]. Gasoline spread into Summit Creek, then, into [[Donner Lake]]. About 300 gallons spilled. The cause of the leakage was stress corrosion cracking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No. 5-2005-5020H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/520055020H/520055020H_corrective%20action%20order_04212005.pdf?nocache=4253 |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054322/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/520055020H/520055020H_corrective%20action%20order_04212005.pdf?nocache=4253 |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law360.com/articles/25295/kinder-morgan-pays-5-3m-for-california-oil-spills |title=Kinder Morgan Pays $5.3M For California Oil Spills |publisher= |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205010432/http://www.law360.com/articles/25295/kinder-morgan-pays-5-3m-for-california-oil-spills |archivedate=December 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration Corrective Order to Richard D.

* On May 4, a petroleum products pipeline failed near [[El Dorado, Kansas]], spilling about 78,000 gallons of diesel fuel, of which about 46,000 gallons were lost. The pipeline failed from external corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ksn.com/2015/05/04/diesel-fuel-leaks-into-creek-near-el-dorado/ |title=Diesel fuel leaks into creek near El Dorado |author= |date= |work=KSN-TV |accessdate=May 23, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610042143/http://ksn.com/2015/05/04/diesel-fuel-leaks-into-creek-near-el-dorado/ |archivedate=June 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dot2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/operator/OperatorIM_opid_22610.html?nocache=4343#_Incidents_tab_4 |title=PHMSA: Stakeholder Communications – Operator Information |author= |date= |work=dot.gov |accessdate=May 23, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602230725/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/operator/OperatorIM_opid_22610.html?nocache=4343 |archivedate=June 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 13, an underground natural gas pipeline exploded near [[Marshall, Texas]], sending a giant fireball into the sky and hurling a {{convert|160|ft|m|adj=on}} section of pipe onto the grounds of a nearby electric power generating plant. Two people were hurt. The OPS concluded that stress corrosion cracking was the culprit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No.4-2005-1011 |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/420051011H/cpf_420051011H.pdf?nocache=8618 |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071502/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/420051011H/cpf_420051011H.pdf?nocache=8618 |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 13, the 30-inch [[Seaway Pipeline]], operated by TEPPCO at the time, failed in [[Bryan County, Oklahoma]], spilling approximately 898 barrels of crude oil. Oil reached Eastman Creek. The discharge was caused by a 6-inch longitudinal seam split on the pipeline that resulted from a stress crack that may have been induced by conditions occurring during rail transport of the pipe, and enlarged by pressure-cycle-induced stresses over years of operation of the pipeline.&lt;ref name="www2.epa.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No. 4-200S-S02OH |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/420055020H/cpf_420055020H.pdf?nocache=6120 |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070107/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/420055020H/cpf_420055020H.pdf?nocache=6120 |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 23, a Magellan Pipeline petroleum products pipeline broke near [[Kansas City, Kansas]], spilling gasoline into the nearby [[Missouri River]]. About 2,936 barrels of gasoline were spilled, with about 2,400 barrels being lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&amp;dat=20050524&amp;id=qa9TAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pTgNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6812,1883891|title=Lawrence Journal-World – Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/safety/IncDetSt_st_KS_flt_sig.html?nocache=3916 |title=PHMSA: Stakeholder Communications |website=Primis.phmsa.dot.gov |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022132703/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/safety/IncDetSt_st_KS_flt_sig.html?nocache=3916 |archivedate=October 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 28, a {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} [[Kinder Morgan Energy Partners]] pipeline ruptured in [[El Paso, Texas]], releasing gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No. 4-200S-S021H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/420055021H/cpf_420055021H.pdf?nocache=6836 |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070221/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/420055021H/cpf_420055021H.pdf?nocache=6836 |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On August 11, a bulldozer hit a crude oil pipeline north of [[Lufkin, Texas]]. The escaping crude ignited, injuring the bulldozer operator. About 18,500 gallons of crude oil were lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=20050812&amp;id=9wFaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DksNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3062,2400235|title=The Victoria Advocate – Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/271786 |title=Aug. 11, 2005 – ProPublica |publisher= |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914134301/http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/271786 |archivedate=September 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On August 18, a leak was detected in an insulating flange along the [[BP Amoco]] Whiting to River Rouge pipeline at a monitoring well in [[Granger, Indiana]]. Initially, the bolts and nuts were replaced around the flange to mitigate any leaks; on August 25, when supply concerns diminished, the insulating flange was cut out and replaced with a straight section of pipe. Approximately 21 gallons of gasoline were removed from the ground, with no injuries or fatalities. Metallurgical analysis revealed that the fiber ring joint gasket had evidence of a prior leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/docs/AmocoBPflange_red_app_d.pdf |title=US DoT report |date=June 20, 2012 |website=phmsa.dot.gov |publisher=US DoT}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On August 29 [[Hurricane Katrina]] caused a protective levee to fail near Nairn, Louisiana in [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana]], causing a Shell 20-inch pipeline to rupture. About 13,400 gallons were spilled, with about 10,500 gallons of this spill reaching the shoreline, and coastal marshes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tos.org/oceanography/archive/19-2_pine.pdf |title=19.2_text.indd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027234229/http://www.tos.org/oceanography/archive/19-2_pine.pdf |archivedate=October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are some notable [[tornado]]es, [[tornado outbreak]]s, and [[tornado outbreak sequence]]s that have occurred around the globe.

# ''Exact death and injury counts are not possible; especially for large events and events before 1955.''
# ''Prior to 1950 in the United States, only significant tornadoes are listed for the number of tornadoes in outbreaks.''
# ''Due to increasing detection, particularly in the U.S., numbers of counted tornadoes have increased markedly in recent decades although the number of actual tornadoes and counted [[Glossary of tornado terms#S|significant]] tornadoes has not. In older events, the number of tornadoes officially counted is likely underestimated.''

[[File:Magsat sketch-1.jpg|thumb|400px|Sketch of Magsat]]
'''Magsat''' ('''Mag'''netic Field '''Sat'''ellite, [[Explorer program|Explorer]] 61, Applications Explorer Mission-3 or AEM-3) [[spacecraft]] was launched in the fall of 1979 and ended in the spring of 1980.&lt;ref&gt;
Langel R, Ousley G, Berbert J, Murphy J, and Settle M. [http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1982/GL009i004p00243.shtml ''The MAGSAT Mission'']. GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 9, NO. 4, PAGES 243–245, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The mission was to map the [[Earth's magnetic field]], the [[satellite]] had two [[magnetometer]]s. The scalar (Cesium vapor) and vector (fluxgate) magnetometers gave Magsat a capability beyond that of any previous spacecraft.  Extended by a telescoping boom, the magnetometers were distanced from the magnetic field created by the satellite and its electronics. The satellite carried two magnetometers, a three-axis fluxgate magnetometer for determining the strength and direction of magnetic fields, and an ion-vapor/vector magnetometer for determining the magnetic field caused by the vector magnetometer itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/personnel/russell/ESS265/History.html History of Vector Magnetometers in Space]&lt;/ref&gt; 
MAGSAT is considered to be one of the more important Science/Earth orbiting satellites launched; the data it accumulated is still being used, particularly in linking new satellite data to past observations.

After launch the payload was brought to an orbit of 96.8° facing the Sun as the Earth rotated underneath. It was kept in a close Earth orbit, with vector magnetometers capable of sensing magnetic fields closer to Earth's surface. The data collected by this satellite allowed a 3D-mapping of the Earth's magnetic interior as never seen before. In combination with a later satellite, [[Ørsted (satellite)|Ørsted]], it has been an essential component for explaining the current declining state of the Earth's magnetic field.&lt;ref name="pmid11948347"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hulot G, Eymin C, Langlais B, Mandea M, Olsen N |title=Small-scale structure of the geodynamo inferred from Oersted and Magsat satellite data |journal=Nature |volume=416 |issue=6881 |pages=620–3 |date=April 2002 |pmid=11948347 |doi=10.1038/416620a |url=|bibcode=2002Natur.416..620H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2004/0517magnet.html NASA AND USGS MAGNETIC DATABASE "ROCKS" THE WORLD] NASA Web Feature, NASA&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On October 30, 1979 Magsat was launched from pad SLC-5 at Vandenberg AFB in California on a [[Scout rocket|Scout II (101) rocket]] bearing 97° in a dusk to dawn orbit.&lt;ref&gt;Mobley F, Eckard L, Fountain G, and  Ousley G. – [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1060781 MAGSAT — A new satellite to survey the earth's magnetic field.] 1980. IEEE Transactions on Magnetics 16 (5): 758–760.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacearchive.info/vafblog.htm Vandenberg AFB Launch History. The Space Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft was placed in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|350|km}} and an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|550|km}}. After reaching orbit, its telescoping boom was extended outward by {{convert|6|m}}. Two star cameras were used to define the position of the spacecraft relative to Earth. The orbit allowed the satellite to map a majority of the Earth's surfaces except the geographic poles. The satellite decayed from orbit on June 11, 1980.

== Computers and data processing ==
According to a Johns Hopkins University / Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) report,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.retrotechnology.com/memship/magsat_command.pdf|title=Space Programs – The Microprocessor-Based MAGSAT Command System|last=Lew|first=Ark L.|date=February 1980|website=|publisher=|access-date=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and archival NASA source documentation (Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest, July–September 1980, Vol. 1, No. 3),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest July–September 1980, Vol. 1, No. 3|url=http://core2.gsfc.nasa.gov/research/mag_field/purucker/APL-Technical-Digest_1-3.pdf|website=NASA Archives|publisher=Johns Hopkins|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the MAGSAT spacecraft utilized two [[RCA 1802]] microprocessors running at a 2&amp;nbsp;MHz clock speed in a redundant setup. A stored memory of 2.8 kilobytes in PROMs with 1 K bytes of random access memory (RAM) provided the program and working space for the microprocessor. Other integrated circuits chips of the CDP 1800 family of circuits were also used, including the CDP 1852 interface circuit and the CDP 1822 1K x 1 RAM, as well as Harris CMOS 6611A PROMS.

Three families of circuits were considered for the computer system design: two NMOS families (the [[Motorola 6800]] and [[Intel 8080]] microprocessors) and the RCA CDP1802 CMOS microprocessor. The 1802 was chosen based on various criteria, including the 1802 [[CMOS]] technology being power efficient by two orders of magnitude compared to the [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] microprocessors, compatibility with the existing power supply of the satellite and the low-power requirements of CMOS, the [[radiation hardening]] of the 1802 and lack thereof in the 6800 and 8080, and other 1802-based functioning and features.

Software for the project was developed with an in-house [[APL (programming language)|APL]]-generated 1802 cross-assembler running on [[IBM 360]]/370 mainframe computers.

==Critique==
Magsat was not without problems. One of the biggest is that the motion of a metallic object tends to create a magnetic field. One study after the mission found a nonlinear fluxgate response when exposed to fields greater than 5000 mT. The applied field had to be transverse to the axis of the magnetometer.&lt;ref&gt;Acuna, M. H., MAGSAT – Vector Magnetometer Absolute Sensor Alignment Determination. September 1981. NASA technical Memorandum 79648. Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA&lt;/ref&gt; The design was improved by creating a feedback relay over a spherical design.&lt;ref&gt;Primdahl, F., H. Luhr and E. K. Lauridsen, The Effect of Large Uncompensated Transverse Fields on the Fluxgate Magnetic Sensor Output, Danish Space Research Institute Report 1-92, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the design used on later spacecraft [See:[[Ørsted (satellite)]]].

This configuration magnetometer was also later used on the [[Magnetometer (Juno)|Magnetometer]] of the Jupiter orbiter [[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]], which arrived at the planet Jupiter in the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://junomag.gsfc.nasa.gov/instrument/fluxgate.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marcahuasi''' ({{IPA-es|maɾkaˈwasi}}) is a plateau in the [[Andes Mountains]], located 60 km east of [[Lima]], on the mountain range that rises to the right bank of the [[Rímac River]]. This mountain range dominates the landscape at 4,000 m above sea level and the place is known for curious shapes of human faces and animals visible in granite rock.

The place was first investigated  by Daniel Ruzo during the 1950s and in an area of about 3&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, several hundred curious shapes are found, which can be presumed as natural formations.&lt;ref name=mark&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlotto|first1=Mark|title=The Cydonia Controversy|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781435755796|page=170,171|edition=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=srxWAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=marcahuasi&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The place is located at a height of about 12500 feet in the [[Andes Mountain]].&lt;ref name=bc&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mysterious Stone Monuments of Markawasi Peru|url=http://www.bcvideo.com/markawasi.html|website=bcvidio|publisher=B C Video|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The plateau originated from a volcanic reaction. It is about 4 square kilometers in area, and is located almost 4,000 meters high in [[Huarochirí Province]], east of [[Lima]], [[Peru]]. Marcahuasi is home to a unique set of huge granite rocks with curious shapes resembling human faces, animals, and religious symbols. There are many theories as to their origins, including the assertion that their unusual shapes formed naturally through erosion. Some argued that they are sculptures shaped by ancient people but archaeologists clearly state that the shapes are the result of erosion over centuries. There are some small pre-Columbian structures, which are tombs of ancient people and some of which are robbed and vandalised.&lt;ref name=robert&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schoch|first1=Dr. Robert M|title=The Mystery of Markawasi|publisher=Circular Times|edition=2005|url=http://www.robertschoch.net/Mystery%20of%20Markawasi.htm|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a collection of ruins on the north side of the plateau. Over 50 structures still stand in varying states of decay. The doorways are very small, some three feet high. Most of the structures are narrow since the use of arches was not known, therefore spans had to be covered with suitable rock that may have been quarried locally. There are also what appear to be burial tombs on the outskirts of the settlement.

[[File:Discovery of neon isotopes.JPG|thumb|right|300 px|[[J. J. Thomson]] discovered the isotopes of [[neon]] using mass spectrometry.]]
The '''mass''' recorded by a [[mass spectrometer]] can refer to different physical quantities depending on the characteristics of the instrument and the manner in which the [[mass spectrum]] is displayed.

==Units==
The [[unified atomic mass unit]] (symbol: u) is the standard [[Unit of measurement|unit]] that is used for indicating [[mass]] on an atomic or molecular scale ([[atomic mass]]).  The dalton (symbol: Da) is equivalent to the unified atomic mass unit. One unified atomic mass unit is approximately the mass of one a single proton or neutron.&lt;ref name="Stryer 2007 35"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stryer|first=Jeremy M. Berg; John L. Tymoczko; Lubert|title=Biochemistry|date=2007|publisher=Freeman|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7167-8724-2|edition=3rd print, 6th|page=35|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unified atomic mass unit has a value of {{val|1.660538921|(73)|e=-27|ul=kg}}.&lt;ref name="CODATA"&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/constants Fundamental Physical Constants from NIST]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''amu'' without the "unified" prefix is an obsolete unit based on oxygen, which was replaced in 1961.
 
==Molecular mass==
[[File:Caffeine mass.gif|right|thumb|300 px|Theoretical isotope distribution for the molecular ion of [[caffeine]]]]
The [[molecular mass]] (abbreviated M&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) of a [[chemical compound|substance]], formerly also called molecular weight and abbreviated as MW, is the [[mass]] of one [[molecule]] of that substance, relative to the [[unified atomic mass unit]] u (equal to 1/12 the mass of one [[atom]] of [[carbon-12|&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C]]). Due to this relativity, the molecular mass of a substance is commonly referred to as the relative molecular mass, and abbreviated to M&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Average mass==
The average mass of a molecule is obtained by summing the [[average atomic mass]]es of the constituent elements. For example, the average mass of natural [[water]] with formula H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is 1.00794 + 1.00794 + 15.9994 = 18.01528.

==Mass number==
The [[mass number]],  also called the [[nucleon]] number, is the number of [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s in an [[atomic nucleus]]. The mass number is unique for each [[isotope]] of an element and is written either after the element name or as a superscript to the left of an element's symbol. For example, [[carbon-12]] (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C) has 6 protons and 6 neutrons.

==Nominal mass==
The '''nominal mass''' for an element is the mass number of its most abundant naturally occurring stable isotope, and for an ion or molecule, the nominal mass is the sum of the nominal masses of the constituent atoms.&lt;ref name="Gross2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jürgen H Gross|title=Mass Spectrometry: A Textbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xHOQiaquq24C&amp;pg=PA71|date=14 February 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-10709-2|pages=71–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WatsonSparkman2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Throck Watson|author2=O. David Sparkman|title=Introduction to Mass Spectrometry: Instrumentation, Applications, and Strategies for Data Interpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mUsSAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT385|date=9 July 2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-68158-9|pages=385–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isotope abundances are tabulated by [[IUPAC]]:&lt;ref name="BerglundWieser2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berglund|first1=Michael|last2=Wieser|first2=Michael E.|title=Isotopic compositions of the elements 2009 (IUPAC Technical Report)|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=83|issue=2|pages=397–410|year=2011|issn=1365-3075|doi=10.1351/PAC-REP-10-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example carbon has two stable isotopes &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C at 98.9% natural abundance and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C at 1.1% natural abundance, thus the nominal mass of carbon is 12. The nominal mass is not always the lowest mass number, for example iron has isotopes &lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, and &lt;sup&gt;58&lt;/sup&gt;Fe with abundances 6%, 92%, 10%, and 2%, respectively, and a nominal mass of 56.  For a molecule, the nominal mass is obtained by summing the nominal masses of the constituent elements, for example water has two hydrogen atoms with nominal mass 1 and one oxygen atom with nominal mass 16, therefore the nominal mass of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is 18.

In mass spectrometry, the difference between the nominal mass and the monoisotopic mass is the [[mass defect]].&lt;ref name="Sleno2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sleno|first1=Lekha|title=The use of mass defect in modern mass spectrometry|journal=Journal of Mass Spectrometry|volume=47|issue=2|year=2012|pages=226–236|issn=1076-5174|doi=10.1002/jms.2953|pmid=22359333|bibcode=2012JMSp...47..226S}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from the definition of mass defect used in physics which is the difference between the mass of a composite particle and the sum of the masses of its constituent parts.&lt;ref name="FerrerThurman2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Imma Ferrer|author2=E. M. Thurman|title=Liquid Chromatography Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nhU0dZ9sklwC&amp;pg=PA19|date=6 May 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-42995-2|pages=18–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accurate mass==
The '''accurate mass''' (more appropriately, the measured accurate mass&lt;ref name="ODS"&gt;{{cite  book| author=O. David Sparkman| title=Mass Spec Desk Reference|edition= 2nd.| page=60 |ISBN=0-9660813-9-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an experimentally determined mass that allows the elemental composition to be determined.&lt;ref name="pmid16124033"&gt;{{Citation|author=Grange AH |author2=Winnik W |author3=Ferguson PL |author4=Sovocool GW|title=Using a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer in accurate mass mode and an ion correlation program to identify compounds|journal=Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom.|volume=19|issue=18|pages=2699–715|date=2005|pmid=16124033|doi=10.1002/rcm.2112|postscript=.|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1229344 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; For molecules with mass below 200 [[Atomic mass unit|u]], 5 [[Parts per million|ppm]] accuracy is often sufficient to uniquely determine the elemental composition.&lt;ref name=Gross1994&gt;{{Citation|last=Gross|first=M. L.|date=1994|title=Accurate Masses for Structure Confirmation|journal=J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom.|volume=5|page=57|doi=10.1016/1044-0305(94)85036-4|pmid=24222515|issue=2|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exact mass==
The '''exact mass''' of an isotopic species (more appropriately, the calculated exact mass&lt;ref name="ODS"/&gt;) is obtained by summing the masses of the individual isotopes of the molecule. For example, the exact mass of water containing two hydrogen-1 (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H) and one oxygen-16 (&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O) is 1.0078 + 1.0078 + 15.9949 = 18.0105. The exact mass of [[heavy water]], containing two hydrogen-2 ([[deuterium]] or &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H) and one oxygen-16 (&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O) is 2.0141 + 2.0141 + 15.9949 = 20.0229.

When an exact mass value is given without specifying an isotopic species, it normally refers to the most abundant isotopic species.

==Monoisotopic mass==
{{main|monoisotopic mass}}
The monoisotopic mass is the sum of the [[mass]]es of the [[atom]]s in a [[molecule]] using the unbound, ground-state, rest mass of the principal (most abundant) isotope for each element.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Monoisotopic mass spectrum|journal=IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology (the Gold Book)|date=2009|doi=10.1351/goldbook.M04014|isbn=978-0-9678550-9-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WatsonSparkman2013" /&gt; The monoisotopic mass of a molecule or ion is the exact mass obtained using the principal isotopes. Monoisotopic mass is typically expressed in unified atomic mass units.

For typical organic compounds, where the monoisotopic mass is most commonly used, this also results in the lightest isotope being selected. For some heavier atoms such as [[iron]] and [[argon]] the principal isotope is not the lightest isotope. The mass spectrum peak corresponding to the monoisotopic mass is often not observed for large molecules, but can be determined from the isotopic distribution.&lt;ref name="SenkoBeu1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senko|first1=Michael W.|last2=Beu|first2=Steven C.|last3=McLaffertycor|first3=Fred W.|title=Determination of monoisotopic masses and ion populations for large biomolecules from resolved isotopic distributions|journal=Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry|volume=6|issue=4|year=1995|pages=229–233|issn=1044-0305|doi=10.1016/1044-0305(95)00017-8|pmid=24214167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Most abundant mass==
[[File:Glucagon mass.gif|right|thumb|300 px|Theoretical isotope distribution for the molecular ion of [[glucagon]] (C&lt;sub&gt;153&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;224&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;S)]]
This refers to the mass of the molecule with the most highly represented isotope distribution, based on the [[natural abundance]] of the isotopes.&lt;ref name="pmid15928922"&gt;{{Citation|author=Goraczko AJ|title=Molecular mass and location of the most abundant peak of the molecular ion isotopomeric cluster|journal=Journal of Molecular Modeling|volume=11|issue=4–5|pages=271–7|date=2005|pmid=15928922|doi=10.1007/s00894-005-0245-x|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isotopomer and isotopologue==
[[Isotopomer]]s (isotopic isomers) are [[isomer]]s having the same number of each [[isotope|isotopic]] atom, but differing in the positions of the isotopic atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=isotopomer|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/I03352.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHDCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D are a pair of [[structural isomer|structural]] isotopomers.

Isotopomers should not be confused with [[isotopologue]]s, which are chemical species that differ in the [[isotope|isotopic]] composition of their [[molecule]]s or [[ion]]s. For example, three isotopologues of the [[Properties of water|water molecule]] with different isotopic composition of hydrogen are: HOH, HOD and DOD, where D stands for deuterium (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H).

==Kendrick mass==
The [[Kendrick mass]] is a mass obtained by multiplying the measured mass by a numeric factor. The Kendrick mass is used to aid in the identification of molecules of similar chemical structure from peaks in [[mass spectra]].&lt;ref name='Kendrick 1963'&gt;{{Citation|doi=10.1021/ac60206a048|title=A mass scale based on CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 14.0000 for high resolution mass spectrometry of organic compounds|journal=[[Anal. Chem.]]|date=1963|first=Edward|last=Kendrick|volume=35|issue=13|pages=2146–2154|id= |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14730994"&gt;{{Citation |author=Marshall AG |author2=Rodgers RP |title=Petroleomics: the next grand challenge for chemical analysis |journal=[[Acc.

According to the procedure outlined by Kendrick, the mass of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as 14.000 Da, instead of 14.01565 Da.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Mopper | first1 = Kenneth | last2 = Stubbins | first2 = Aron | last3 = Ritchie | first3 = Jason D. | last4 = Bialk | first4 = Heidi M. | last5 = Hatcher | first5 = Patrick G. | title = Advanced Instrumental Approaches for Characterization of Marine Dissolved Organic Matter:  Extraction Techniques, Mass Spectrometry, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 107 | issue = 2 | pages = 419–42 | date = 2007 | pmid = 17300139 | doi = 10.1021/cr050359b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Meija | first1 = Juris | title = Mathematical tools in analytical mass spectrometry | journal = Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry | volume = 385 | issue = 3 | pages = 486–99 | date = 2006 | pmid = 16514517 | doi = 10.1007/s00216-006-0298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kendrick mass for a family of compounds F is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Kim|first1=Sunghwan|last2=Kramer|first2=Robert W.|last3=Hatcher|first3=Patrick G.|title=Graphical Method for Analysis of Ultrahigh-Resolution Broadband Mass Spectra of Natural Organic Matter, the Van Krevelen Diagram|journal=Analytical Chemistry|volume=75|issue=20|pages=5336–44|date=2003|pmid=14710810|doi=10.1021/ac034415p }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Kendrick~mass~(F) = (observed~mass) \times \frac{nominal~mass~F}{exact~mass~F}~&lt;/math&gt;.

For hydrocarbon analysis, F=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Mass defect (mass spectrometry)==
The [[mass defect]] used in nuclear physics is different from its use in mass spectrometry. In nuclear physics, the mass defect is the difference in the mass of a composite particle and the sum of the masses of its component parts. In mass spectrometry the mass defect is defined as the difference between the exact mass and the nearest integer mass.&lt;ref name="WatsonSparkman2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Throck Watson|author2=O. David Sparkman|title=Introduction to Mass Spectrometry: Instrumentation, Applications, and Strategies for Data Interpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ox1bWqYqZT4C&amp;pg=PA274|date=4 December 2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-51634-8|pages=274–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gross2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jürgen H Gross|title=Mass Spectrometry: A Textbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PdMnDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143|date=22 June 2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-54398-7|pages=143–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kendrick mass defect is the exact Kendrick mass subtracted from the nearest integer Kendrick mass.&lt;ref name="HugheyHendrickson2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughey|first1=Christine A.|last2=Hendrickson|first2=Christopher L.|last3=Rodgers|first3=Ryan P.|last4=Marshall|first4=Alan G.|last5=Qian|first5=Kuangnan|title=Kendrick Mass Defect Spectrum:  A Compact Visual Analysis for Ultrahigh-Resolution Broadband Mass Spectra|journal=Analytical Chemistry|volume=73|issue=19|year=2001|pages=4676–4681|issn=0003-2700|doi=10.1021/ac010560w}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass defect filtering can be used to selectively detect compounds with a mass spectrometer based on their chemical composition.&lt;ref name="Sleno2012" /&gt;

==Packing fraction (mass spectrometry)==
[[File:Francis William Aston.jpg|right|thumb|250 px|[[Francis William Aston]] won the 1922 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his discovery, by means of his [[mass spectrograph]], of isotopes, in a large number of non-radioactive elements, and for his enunciation of the [[whole number rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1922/  | title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1922  | accessdate=2008-04-14  | publisher=Nobel Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='a804629h'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Francis Aston and the mass spectrograph | journal=[[Dalton Transactions]] | date=1998 | first=Gordon | last=Squires | volume= 0| issue= 23| pages=3893–3900 | doi= 10.1039/a804629h | url=http://www.rsc.org/publishing/journals/DT/article.asp?doi=a804629h | accessdate=2007-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The term '''packing fraction''' was defined by Aston as the difference of the measured mass ''M'' and the nearest integer mass ''I'' (based on the [[oxygen-16]] mass scale) divided by the quantity comprising the mass number multiplied by ten thousand:&lt;ref name="Aston1927"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aston|first1=F. W.|title=Atoms and their Packing Fractions1|journal=Nature|volume=120|issue=3035|year=1927|pages=956–959|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/120956a0|bibcode=1927Natur.120..956A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f=\frac{M-I}{10^4\ I} &lt;/math&gt;.

Aston's early model of [[nuclear structure]] (prior to the [[discovery of the neutron]]) postulated that the electromagnetic fields of closely packed protons and electrons in the nucleus would interfere and a fraction of the mass would be destroyed.&lt;ref name="BudzikiewiczGrigsby2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Budzikiewicz|first1=Herbert|last2=Grigsby|first2=Ronald D.|title=Mass spectrometry and isotopes: A century of research and discussion|journal=Mass Spectrometry Reviews|volume=25|issue=1|year=2006|pages=146–157|issn=0277-7037|doi=10.1002/mas.20061|pmid=16134128|bibcode=2006MSRv...25..146B}}&lt;/ref&gt; A low packing fraction is indicative of a stable nucleus.&lt;ref name="Dempster1938"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dempster|first1=A.

==Nitrogen rule==
The [[nitrogen rule]] states that [[organic compound]]s containing exclusively [[hydrogen]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[silicon]], [[phosphorus]], [[sulfur]], and the [[halogen]]s either have an odd [[nominal mass]] that indicates an [[odd number]] of nitrogen atoms are present or an even nominal mass that indicates an [[even number]] of nitrogen atoms are present in the [[molecular ion]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-935702-25-3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tureček, František |author2=McLafferty, Fred W. |title=Interpretation of mass spectra |publisher=University Science Books |location=Sausalito, Calif |date=1993 |pages= 37–38|isbn=978-0-935702-25-5 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-9660813-9-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=David O.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3296">'''Mediterranean conifer and mixed forests''' is an [[ecoregion]], in the [[Temperate coniferous forests|temperate coniferous forest]] [[biome]],  which occupies the high mountain ranges of [[North Africa]] and southern [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;World Wildlife Fund, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also a botanically recognized plant association in the African and Mediterranean literature.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Van der Linde, Anada Tiéga and Thomas Price, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==

The Mediterranean conifer and mixed forests ecoregion consists of a series of enclaves in the coastal [[Rif Mountains]] and interior [[Middle Atlas]] and [[High Atlas]] of [[Morocco]], the eastern [[Tell Atlas]] and eastern [[Saharan Atlas]] of [[Algeria]], and the [[Kroumerie]] and [[Mogod Mountains|Mogod]] ranges of [[Tunisia]]. 

The [[Mediterranean woodlands and forests]] ecoregion surrounds the Mediterranean conifer and mixed forests at lower elevations.  

In the High Atlas, the Mediterranean conifer and mixed forests yield to the [[Mediterranean High Atlas juniper steppe]] at the highest elevations.

==Flora==
The predominant canopy tree in the forests is [[Atlas cedar]] (''Cedrus atlantica''). Other conifer trees that grow in this area may include pines such as [[Aleppo pine]] and [[Maritime pine]]. Firs such as the [[Spanish fir]] and the [[Algerian fir]]. Junipers such as [[Juniperus oxycedrus]] and [[Juniperus thurifera]] And Yews such as [[Taxus baccata]].

Other non-coniferous trees can be found in scattered area throughout this Eco-region which includes [[cork oak]], [[White willow]] and any other oaks and trees.  
''[[Quercus afares]]'', a deciduous oak, is [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to the ecoregion.

==Fauna==
Endangered mammals in the ecoregion include the [[Barbary macaque]] (''Macaca sylvanus'') at locations such as the [[Djebel Babor Mountains]];&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; other species in the ecoregion include [[Atlas deer]] (''Cervus elaphus barbarus''), and the [[African leopard]] (''Panthera pardus pardus'').

==Conservation and threats==
Deforestation due to overuse by the local population is a major threat as are the effects of climate change.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3503">The '''Mid-Continental Canadian forests''' are a [[taiga]] [[ecoregion]] of northern [[Canada]].

==Setting==
This ecoregion extends from south of the [[Great Slave Lake]] in the [[Northwest Territories]] through most of northeastern [[Alberta]], central [[Saskatchewan]] and parts of west-central [[Manitoba]] and consists of three main areas: the [[Slave River]] basin in northeastern Alberta, the lowlands of the northern Manitoba plain, and the uplands south of the [[Canadian Shield]] from north-central Alberta to southwestern Manitoba. This is a mixed area of lowlands and mountains up to 800m high, including areas of wetland and peat bog and mountain lakes and ponds. The area has a subhumid mid-boreal ecoclimate with short summers (average temperature 14°C) and long, cold winters (ave. -15°C) and patches of permafrost in the lowlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=na0608|name=Mid-Continental Canadian forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
These forests, like so much of Canada at this latitude, are a mixture of conifers and deciduous trees including quaking aspen (''[[Populus tremuloides]]''), balsam poplar (''[[Populus balsamifera]]''), white spruce (''[[Picea glauca]]''), black spruce (''[[Picea mariana]]'')  and balsam fir (''[[Abies balsamea]]'').

==Fauna==
Wildlife of the area includes moose (''[[Alces alces]]''), American black bear (''[[Ursus americanus]]''), wolf (''[[Canis lupus]]''), Canada lynx (''[[Lynx canadensis]]''), white-tailed deer (''[[Odocoileus virginianus]]''), elk (''[[Cervus canadensis]]''), North American beaver (''[[Castor canadensis]]''), muskrat (''[[Ondatra zibethicus]]''), snowshoe hare (''[[Lepus americanus]]''). The plain to the south of the lake is home to moose, coyote (''[[Canis latrans]]''), and eastern cottontail (''[[Sylvilagus floridanus]]'') as well. [[Wood Buffalo National Park]] on the Slave River is the largest national park in Canada and home to the world's largest herd of American bison (''[[Bison bison]]'').

Birds include ducks, geese, American white pelican (''[[Pelecanus erythrorhynchos]]''), sandhill crane (''[[Grus canadensis]]''), ruffed grouse (''[[Bonasa umbellus]]'') and common loon (''[[Gavia immer]]'') The wetlands of the region, such as [[Cumberland Lake]], are an important refuge for migratory birds and include the most important breeding populations of the endangered [[whooping crane]] in North America.

==Threats and preservation==
Half of the natural forest remains intact, the other half having been removed by extensive logging, oil and gas exploration and mining. Blocks of [[intact forest landscape|intact forest]] include Wood Buffalo Park, the areas around [[Cold Lake (Alberta)|Cold Lake]]/[[Primrose Lake]] and [[Doré Lake]], [[Prince Albert National Park]], to the north of Cumberland Lake, [[Riding Mountain National Park]], [[Porcupine Hills]], [[Duck Mountain Provincial Park (Manitoba)]], [[Duck Mountain Provincial Park (Saskatchewan)]] (near the town of [[Kamsack, Saskatchewan|Kamsack]]) and the [[Peace–Athabasca Delta]] on the Slave River. Other protected areas include [[Clearwater River (Saskatchewan)]], [[Meadow Lake Provincial Park]] (near [[Goodsoil, Saskatchewan]]) and [[Narrow Hills Provincial Park]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6307">'''Stellar molecules''' are [[molecule]]s that exist or form in [[star]]s. Such formations can take place when the [[temperature]] is low enough for molecules to form – typically around 6000&amp;nbsp;K or cooler.&lt;ref name=Masseron2015&gt;{{citation

==Background==
[[Matter]] is made up by [[atom]]s (formed by [[proton]]s and other [[subatomic particle]]s). When the environment is right, atoms can join together and form [[molecules]], which give rise to most materials studied in [[materials science]]. But certain environments, such as high temperatures, don't allow atoms to form molecules. Stars have very high temperatures, primarily in their interior, and therefore there are few molecules formed in stars. For this reason, a [[chemist]] (who studies atoms and molecules) would not have much to study in a star, so stars are better explained by [[physicist]]s. However, low abundance of molecules in stars is not equated with no molecules at all.&lt;ref name="smol"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/stellar-molecules |title=Stellar Molecules » American Scientist |doi=10.1511/2013.105.403 |publisher=American Scientist |date= |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence and research==
Although the [[Sun]] is a star, its [[photosphere]] has a low enough temperature of 6,000 [[kelvin]]s, and therefore molecules can form.  [[Water]] has been found on the Sun, and there is evidence of [[molecular hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in [[white dwarf]] stellar atmospheres.&lt;ref name="smol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="XuJura2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Xu |first1=S. |last2=Jura |first2=M. |last3=Koester |first3=D. |last4=Klein |first4=B. |last5=Zuckerman |first5=B. |title=DISCOVERY OF MOLECULAR HYDROGEN IN WHITE DWARF ATMOSPHERES |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=766 |issue=2 |year=2013 |pages=L18 |issn=2041-8205 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/766/2/L18|arxiv = 1302.6619 |bibcode = 2013ApJ...766L..18X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooler stars include absorption band spectra that are characteristic of molecules.  Similar absorption bands are found in [[sun spot]]s which are cooler areas on the Sun. Molecules found in the Sun include [[magnesium monohydride|MgH]], [[calcium monohydride|CaH]], [[Iron monohydride|FeH]], [[Chromium monohydride|CrH]], [[NaH]], [[hydroxyl radical|OH]], [[Silicon monohydride|SiH]], [[vanadium monoxide|VO]], and [[titanium monoxide|TiO]]. Others include [[Cyanogen radical|CN]] [[Methylidyne|CH]], [[MgF]], [[Imidogen|NH]], [[dicarbon|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[SrF]], [[zirconium monoxide]], [[yttrium monoxide|YO]], [[Scandium monoxide|ScO]], [[borylene|BH]].&lt;ref name=pam/&gt;

Stars of most types can contain molecules, even the Ap category of [[A class star]]s. Only the hottest O, B and A class stars have no detectable molecules.  Also carbon rich white dwarfs, even though very hot, have spectral lines of  [[dicarbon|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Methylidyne|CH]].&lt;ref name=astroc/&gt;

===Laboratory measurements===
Measurements of simple molecules that may be found in stars are performed in laboratories to determine the wavelengths of the spectra lines. Also it is important to measure the [[dissociation energy]] and oscillator strengths (how strongly the molecule interacts with electromagnetic radiation). These measurements are inserted into formula that can calculate the spectrum under different conditions of pressure and temperature. However man-made conditions are often different to stars, because it is hard to achieve the temperatures, and also [[local thermal equilibrium]], as found in stars, is unlikely. Accuracy of oscillator strengths and actual measurement of dissociation energy is usually only approximate.&lt;ref name=astroc/&gt;

===Model atmosphere===
A numerical model of a star's atmosphere will calculate pressures and temperatures at different depths, and can predict the spectrum for different elemental concentrations.

==Application==
The molecules in stars can be used to determine some characteristics of the star. The isotopic composition can be determined if the lines in the molecular spectrum are observed. The different masses of different isotopes cause vibration and rotation frequencies to significantly vary. Secondly the temperature can be determined, as the temperature will change the numbers of molecules in the different vibrational and rotational states. Some molecules are sensitive to the ratio of elements, and so indicate elemental composition of the star.&lt;ref name=astroc&gt;{{cite book |last1=Symposium |first1=International Astronomical Union |last2=Union |first2=International Astronomical |title=Astrochemistry |date=1987 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9789027723604 |page=852 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nLFYEZyEVQgC&amp;pg=PA583 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different molecules are characteristic of different kinds of stars, and are used to classify them.&lt;ref name=pam&gt;{{cite journal |url=|bibcode=1951ASPL....6..114M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because there can be numerous spectral lines of different strength, conditions at different depths in the star can be determined. These conditions include temperature and speed towards or away from the observer.&lt;ref name=astroc/&gt; 

The spectrum of molecules has advantages over atomic spectral lines, as atomic lines are often very strong, and therefore only come from high in the atmosphere. Also the profile of the atomic spectral line can be distorted due to isotopes or overlaying of other spectral lines.&lt;ref name=astroc/&gt; The molecular spectrum is much more sensitive to temperature than atomic lines.&lt;ref name=astroc/&gt;

Westerly [[monsoon]] winds lie in its equatorward portion while easterly [[trade winds]] exist poleward of the trough.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Meteorological Organization]]. [http://severe.worldweather.wmo.int/tc/sp/acronyms.html Severe Weather Information Centre.] Retrieved on 2008-05-03.&lt;/ref&gt; Right along its axis, heavy rains can be found which usher in the peak of a location's respective [[wet season|rainy season]]. As it passes poleward of a location, hot and dry conditions develop. The monsoon trough plays a role in creating many of the world's [[rainforest]]s.

The term "monsoon trough" is most commonly used in monsoonal regions of the Western Pacific such as Asia and Australia. The migration of the ITCZ/monsoon trough into a landmass heralds the beginning of the annual rainy season during summer months. Depressions and [[tropical cyclone]]s often form in the vicinity of the monsoon trough, with each capable of producing a year's worth of rainfall in a matter of days.

==Movement and strength==
[[File:Februarystreamlinesnavy.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|February position of the ITCZ and monsoon trough in the Pacific Ocean, depicted by area of convergent streamlines offshore Australia and in the equatorial eastern Pacific]]
Monsoon troughing in the western Pacific reaches its zenith in [[latitude]] during the late summer when the wintertime surface ridge in the opposite hemisphere is the strongest.  It can reach as far as the [[40th parallel north|40th parallel]] in East Asia during August and the [[20th parallel south|20th parallel]] in Australia during February. Its poleward progression is accelerated by the onset of the summer monsoon which is characterized by the development of lower air pressure over the warmest part of the various continents.&lt;ref name="NCFMRF"&gt;National Centre for Medium Range Forecasting.

===Effect of wind surges===
Increases in the relative [[vorticity]], or spin, with the monsoon trough are normally a product of increased wind convergence within the [[convergence zone]] of the monsoon trough. Wind surges can lead to this increase in convergence. A strengthening or equatorward movement in the [[subtropical ridge]] can cause a strengthening of a monsoon trough as a wind surge moves towards the location of the monsoon trough. As [[surface weather analysis|front]]s move through the [[subtropics]] and [[tropics]] of one [[hemisphere of the Earth|hemisphere]] during their winter, normally as [[shear line (meteorology)|shear line]]s when their temperature gradient becomes minimal, wind surges can cross the equator in oceanic regions and enhance a monsoon trough in the other hemisphere's summer.&lt;ref&gt;Chih-Lyeu Chen.

===Embedded depressions===
[[File:MonsoonDepression2004091600.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Monsoon Depression near Bangladesh]]
If a circulation forms within the monsoon trough, it is able to compete with the neighboring [[thermal low]] over the continent, and a wind surge will occur at its periphery.  Such a circulation which is broad in nature within a monsoon trough is known as a monsoon depression. In the Northern Hemisphere, monsoon depressions are generally asymmetric, and tend to have their strongest winds on their eastern periphery.&lt;ref name="NAVY3"/&gt; Light and variable winds cover a large area near their center, while bands of showers and thunderstorms develop within their area of circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Chip Guard.

Since the monsoon trough is an area of convergence in the wind pattern, and an elongated area of low pressure at the surface, the trough focuses low level moisture and is defined by one or more elongated [[rainband|bands]] of [[thunderstorm]]s when viewing [[satellite]] imagery. Its abrupt movement to the north between May and June is coincident with the beginning of the monsoon regime and rainy seasons across South and East Asia. This convergence zone has been linked to prolonged heavy rain events in the [[Yangtze]] river as well as northern China.&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt; Its presence has also been linked to the peak of the rainy season in locations within Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bureau of Meteorology]].

A monsoon trough is a significant genesis region for [[tropical cyclone]]s. [[Vorticity]]-rich low level environments, with significant low level spin, lead to a better than average chance of tropical cyclone formation due to their inherent rotation. This is because a pre-existing near-surface disturbance with sufficient spin and convergence is one of the six requirements for [[tropical cyclogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Landsea.

In [[philosophy]], '''naturalism''' is the "idea or belief that only [[Physical law|natural]] (as opposed to [[supernatural]] or [[Spirituality|spiritual]]) laws and forces operate in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Online [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/125337?redirectedFrom=naturalism naturalism]&lt;/ref&gt;  Adherents of naturalism (''i.e.'', naturalists) assert that natural laws are the rules that govern the structure and behavior of the natural universe, that the changing [[universe]] at every stage is a product of these laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10713a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Naturalism|date=21 November 2009|accessdate=6 March 2012|quote=Naturalism is not so much a special system as a point of view or tendency common to a number of philosophical and religious systems; not so much a well-defined set of positive and negative doctrines as an attitude or spirit pervading and influencing many doctrines. As the name implies, this tendency consists essentially in looking upon nature as the one original and fundamental source of all that exists, and in attempting to explain everything in terms of nature. Either the limits of nature are also the limits of existing reality, or at least the first cause, [[cosmological argument|if its existence is found necessary]], has nothing to do with the working of natural agencies. All events, therefore, find their adequate explanation within nature itself. But, as the terms nature and natural are themselves used in more than one sense, the term naturalism is also far from having one fixed meaning.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Naturalism can intuitively be separated into an [[ontological]] and a [[methodological]] component," argues David Papineau.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/|title=Naturalism|last=Papineau|first=David|authorlink=David Papineau|date=22 February 2007|work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Ontological" refers to the philosophical study of the nature of reality. Some philosophers equate naturalism with [[materialism]]. For example, philosopher [[Paul Kurtz]] argues that nature is best accounted for by reference to [[Matter|material]] principles. These principles include [[mass]], [[energy]], and other [[Physical property|physical]] and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] accepted by the [[scientific community]]. Further, this sense of naturalism holds that [[Spirit|spirits]], [[Deity|deities]], and [[Ghost|ghosts]] are not real and that there is no "[[Teleology|purpose]]" in nature. Such an absolute belief in naturalism is commonly referred to as ''[[metaphysical naturalism]]''.&lt;ref name="KurtzDistinction"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kurtz, Paul|authorlink=Paul Kurtz|date=Spring 1998|title=Darwin Re-Crucified: Why Are So Many Afraid of Naturalism?|url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/kurtz_18_2.html|journal=[[Free Inquiry]]|volume=18|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming naturalism in working methods as the current paradigm, without the further consideration of naturalism as an absolute truth with philosophical entailment, is called ''[[methodological naturalism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/schafersman_nat.html|title=Naturalism is Today An Essential Part of Science|last=Schafersman|first=Steven D.|authorlink=Steven Schafersman|year=1996|quote=Methodological naturalism is the adoption or assumption of naturalism in scientific belief and practice without really believing in naturalism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The subject matter here is a philosophy of acquiring knowledge based on an assumed paradigm.

With the exception of [[Pantheism|pantheists]]—who believe that Nature is identical with divinity while not recognizing a distinct personal anthropomorphic god—[[Theism|theists]] challenge the idea that nature contains all of reality. According to some theists, natural laws may be viewed as so-called [[Secondary causation|secondary causes]] of God(s).

In the 20th century, [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[George Santayana]], and other philosophers argued that the success of naturalism in science meant that scientific methods should also be used in philosophy. Science and philosophy are said to form a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]], according to this view.

== Origins and history ==
{{main|History of metaphysical naturalism}}
The current usage of the term naturalism "derives from debates in America in the first half of the last century. The self-proclaimed 'naturalists' from that period included [[John Dewey]], [[Ernest Nagel]], [[Sidney Hook]] and [[Roy Wood Sellars]]."&lt;ref&gt;Papineau, David [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/ "Naturalism"], in "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, metaphysical naturalism is more widely embraced than in previous centuries, especially but not exclusively in the [[natural science]]s and the Anglo-American, [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophical]] communities. While the vast majority of the population of the world remains firmly committed to non-naturalistic worldviews, prominent contemporary defenders of naturalism and/or naturalistic theses and doctrines today include [[J. J. C. Smart]], [[David Malet Armstrong]], [[David Papineau]], [[Paul Kurtz]], [[Brian Leiter]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Michael Devitt]], [[Fred Dretske]], [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]], [[Mario Bunge]], [[Jonathan Schaffer]], [[Hilary Kornblith]], [[Quentin Smith]], [[Paul Draper (philosopher)|Paul Draper]] and [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], among many other academic philosophers.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

According to [[David Papineau]], contemporary naturalism is a consequence of the build-up of scientific evidence during the twentieth century for the "[[causal closure]] of the physical", the doctrine that all physical effects can be accounted for by physical causes.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Papineau]], "The Rise of Physicalism" in ''Physicalism and its Discontents'', Cambridge (2011). URL:http://ebooks.cambridge.org/ebook.jsf?bid=CBO9780511570797&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology ===
The term "[[methodological naturalism]]" is much more recent though. According to [[Ronald Numbers]], it was coined in 1983 by Paul de Vries, a [[Wheaton College, Illinois|Wheaton College]] philosopher. De Vries distinguished between what he called "methodological naturalism," a disciplinary method that says nothing about God's existence, and "metaphysical naturalism," which "denies the existence of a transcendent God."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nick Matzke]]: [http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/03/on_the_origins.html On the Origins of Methodological Naturalism]. ''The Pandas Thumb'' (March 20, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The term "methodological naturalism" had been used in 1937 by [[Edgar S. Brightman]] in an article in ''The Philosophical Review'' as a contrast to "naturalism" in general, but there the idea was not really developed to its more recent distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/archive/asa/200603/0501.html|title=ASA March 2006 – Re: Methodological Naturalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

According to [[Steven Schafersman]], naturalism is a philosophy that maintains that; 
# Nature encompasses all that [[existence|exists]] throughout [[spacetime|space and time]];  
# Nature (the [[universe]] or [[cosmos]]) consists only of natural elements, that is, of spatiotemporal [[physical property|physical]] substance—[[mass]]–[[energy]]. Non-physical or quasi-physical [[substance (philosophy)|substance]], such as [[information]], [[idea]]s, [[values]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[intellect]], and other [[emergentism|emergent phenomena]], either [[supervenience|supervene]] upon the physical or can be [[eliminative materialism|reduced]] to a physical account; 
# Nature operates by the laws of [[physics]] and in principle, can be explained and understood by science and philosophy;
# The [[supernatural]] does not exist, i.e., only nature is [[reality|real]].  Naturalism is therefore a [[metaphysical]] philosophy opposed primarily by Biblical creationism".{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}}

Or, as [[Carl Sagan]] succinctly put it: "''The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagan|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Sagan|title=Cosmos|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=2002|isbn=9780375508325|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition [[Arthur C. Danto]] states that Naturalism, in recent usage, is a species of philosophical monism according to which whatever exists or happens is ''natural'' in the sense of being susceptible to explanation through methods which, although paradigmatically exemplified in the natural sciences, are continuous from domain to domain of objects and events. Hence, naturalism is polemically defined as repudiating the view that there exists or could exist any entities which lie, in principle, beyond the scope of scientific explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Arthur C. |last=Danto|title=The Encyclopedia of Philosophy|chapter=Naturalism}} Editor {{harvnb|Stone|2008|p=2}} "Personally, I place great emphasis on the phrase "in principle", since there are many things that science does not now explain. And perhaps we need some natural piety concerning the ontological limit question as to why there is anything at all. But the idea that naturalism is a polemical notion is important".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assumptions needed for science from naturalism==

According to [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]], all science is based on an approved agenda of unprovable assumptions about the character of the universe, rather than merely on empirical facts. These assumptions—a paradigm—comprise a collection of beliefs, values and techniques that are held by a given scientific community, which legitimize their systems and set the limitations to their investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p98831/pdf/ch0615.pdf|title=Chapter 6, The Privileged Status of Science |first=Lee|last=Boldman|year=2007|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alfred North Whitehead]] wrote, "All science must start with some assumptions as to the ultimate analysis of the facts with which it deals.  These assumptions are justified partly by their adherence to the types of occurrence of which we are directly conscious, and partly by their success in representing the observed facts with a certain generality, devoid of ''ad hoc'' suppositions."{{sfn|Whitehead|1997|p=135}}  Priddy notes that all scientific study inescapably builds on at least some essential assumptions that are untested by scientific processes.&lt;ref name="Priddy 1998"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://robertpriddy.com/lim/5.html |chapter=Chapter Five, Scientific Objectivity in Question  |title=Science Limited |first=Robert |last=Priddy  |year=1998|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; For naturalists, nature is the only reality.  There is no such thing as 'supernatural'.  The scientific method is to be used to investigate all reality, including the human spirit: "The great majority of contemporary philosophers would happily... reject 'supernatural' entities, and allow that science is a possible route (if not necessarily the only one) to important truths about the 'human spirit'."&lt;ref&gt;Papineau, David [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/ "Naturalism"], in "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturalism is the implicit philosophy of working scientists, that the following basic assumptions are needed to justify the scientific method:{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}

#''that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers''.{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}} "The basis for rationality is acceptance of an external objective reality."{{sfn|Durak|2008|p=}} "Objective reality is clearly an essential thing if we are to develop a meaningful perspective of the world. Nevertheless its very existence is assumed."&lt;ref&gt;

It seems more beneficial to assume that an objective reality exists than to live with solipsism, and so people are quite happy to make this assumption. In fact we made this assumption unconsciously when we began to learn about the world as infants. The world outside ourselves appears to respond in ways which are consistent with it being real.  The assumption of objectivism is essential if we are to attach the contemporary meanings to our sensations and feelings and make more sense of them.

# ''that Nature has uniformity of laws and most if not all things in nature must have at least a natural cause.''{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}}  Biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] referred to these two closely related propositions as the constancy of nature's laws and the operation of known processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1987|p=120}}, "You cannot go to a rocky outcrop and observe either the constancy of nature's laws or the working of known processes.  It works the other way around." You first assume these propositions and "then you go to the outcrop of rock."&lt;/ref&gt;  Simpson agrees that the axiom of uniformity of law, an unprovable postulate, is necessary in order for scientists to extrapolate inductive inference into the unobservable past in order to meaningfully study it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1963|pp=24–48}}, "Uniformity is an unprovable postulate justified, or indeed required, on two grounds. First, nothing in our incomplete but extensive knowledge of history disagrees with it.

== Metaphysical naturalism ==
{{Main|Metaphysical naturalism}}
Metaphysical naturalism, also called "ontological naturalism" and "philosophical naturalism", is a philosophical worldview and belief system that holds that there is nothing but natural elements, principles, and relations of the kind studied by the [[natural sciences]], i.e., those required to understand our physical environment by [[mathematical modeling]].  Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers exclusively to the methodology of science, for which metaphysical naturalism provides only one possible ontological foundation.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Metaphysical naturalism holds that all properties related to [[consciousness]] and the [[mind]] are reducible to, or [[supervene]] upon, nature. Broadly, the corresponding theological perspective is [[religious naturalism]] or spiritual naturalism.  More specifically, metaphysical naturalism rejects the [[supernatural]] concepts and explanations that are part of many [[religions]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

== Methodological naturalism&lt;!--'Methodological naturalism' redirects here--&gt; ==
{{further|Alternatives to natural selection}}

'''Methodological naturalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; concerns itself with methods of learning what nature is. These methods are useful in the evaluation of claims about existence and knowledge  and in identifying causal mechanisms responsible for the emergence of physical phenomena.  It attempts to explain and test scientific endeavors, hypotheses, and events with reference to natural causes and events. This second sense of the term "naturalism" seeks to provide a framework within which to conduct the scientific study of the laws of nature.  Methodological naturalism is a way of acquiring knowledge. It is a distinct system of thought concerned with a cognitive approach to reality, and is thus a [[epistemology|philosophy of knowledge]]. Studies by sociologist [[Elaine Howard Ecklund|Elaine Ecklund]] suggest that religious scientists in practice apply methodological naturalism. They report that their religious beliefs affect the way they think about the implications - often moral - of their work, but not the way they practice science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Science vs. Religion: What Scientists Really Think|first=Elaine Howard|last=Ecklund|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195392982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of articles and books from 1996 onward, [[Robert T. Pennock]] wrote using the term "methodological naturalism" to clarify that the [[scientific method]] confines itself to natural explanations without assuming the existence or non-existence of the supernatural, and is not based on dogmatic [[metaphysical naturalism]] (as claimed by [[creationism|creationists]] and proponents of [[intelligent design]], in particular by [[Phillip E. Johnson]]). Pennock's testimony as an expert witness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day3am2.html|title=Kitzmiller v. Dover: Day 3, AM: Robert Pennock (continued)|website=www.talkorigins.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] trial was cited by the Judge in his ''Memorandum Opinion'' concluding that "Methodological naturalism is a 'ground rule' of science today":&lt;ref name=kitz&gt;[[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#4. Whether ID is Science | Kitzmiller v. Dover: Whether ID is Science]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Expert testimony reveals that since the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries, science has been limited to the search for natural causes to explain natural phenomena.... While supernatural explanations may be important and have merit, they are not part of science." Methodological naturalism is thus "a paradigm of science." It is a "ground rule" that "requires scientists to seek explanations in the world around us based upon what we can observe, test, replicate, and verify.&lt;ref&gt;
Judge John E. Jones, III [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/kitzmiller_v_dover_decision2.html Decision of the Court] Expert witnesses were [[John F. Haught]], [[Robert T. Pennock]], and [[Kenneth R. Miller]].  Links in the original to specific testimony records have been deleted here.

=== Alvin Plantinga ===

Plantinga argues that together, naturalism and evolution provide an insurmountable "''defeater'' for the belief that our cognitive faculties are reliable", i.e., a [[skeptical argument]] along the lines of Descartes' [[Evil demon]] or [[Brain in a vat]].&lt;ref name="Beilby2002"&gt;

{{quotation|Take ''philosophical naturalism'' to be the belief that there aren't any supernatural entities - no such person as God, for example, but also no other supernatural entities, and nothing at all like God. My claim was that naturalism and contemporary evolutionary theory are at serious odds with one another - and this despite the fact that the latter is ordinarily thought to be one of the main pillars supporting the edifice of the former. (Of course I am ''not'' attacking the theory of evolution, or anything in that neighborhood; I am instead attacking the conjunction of ''naturalism'' with the view that human beings have evolved in that way. I see no similar problems with the conjunction of ''theism'' and the idea that human beings have evolved in the way contemporary evolutionary science suggests.) More particularly, I argued that the conjunction of naturalism with the belief that we human beings have evolved in conformity with current evolutionary doctrine... is in a certain interesting way self-defeating or self-referentially incoherent.|Alvin Plantinga|Naturalism Defeated?: Essays on Plantinga's Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism|"Introduction"&lt;ref name="Beilby2002"/&gt;}}

=== Robert T. Pennock ===
[[Robert T. Pennock]] contends&lt;ref name=lettuce&gt;[[Robert T. Pennock]], [http://www.msu.edu/~pennock5/research/papers/Pennock_SupNatExpl.html Supernaturalist Explanations and the Prospects for a Theistic Science or "How do you know it was the lettuce?"]&lt;/ref&gt; that as [[supernatural]] agents and powers "are above and beyond the natural world and its agents and powers" and "are not constrained by natural laws", only logical impossibilities constrain what a supernatural agent could not do. He states: "If we could apply natural knowledge to understand supernatural powers, then, by definition, they would not be supernatural". As the supernatural is necessarily a mystery to us, it can provide no grounds on which to judge scientific models. "Experimentation requires observation and control of the variables.... But by definition we have no control over supernatural entities or forces." Science does not deal with meanings; the closed system of scientific reasoning cannot be used to define itself. Allowing science to appeal to untestable supernatural powers would make the scientist's task meaningless, undermine the discipline that allows science to make progress, and "would be as profoundly unsatisfying as the ancient Greek playwright's reliance upon the ''[[deus ex machina]]'' to extract his hero from a difficult predicament."

Naturalism of this sort says nothing about the existence or nonexistence of the supernatural, which by this definition is beyond natural testing. As a practical consideration, the rejection of supernatural explanations would merely be pragmatic, thus it would nonetheless be possible, for an ontological supernaturalist to espouse and practice methodological naturalism. For example, scientists may believe in God while practicing methodological naturalism in their scientific work. This position does not preclude knowledge that is somehow connected to the supernatural. Generally however, anything that can be scientifically examined and explained would not be supernatural, simply by definition.

=== W. V. O. Quine ===
{{main|Naturalized epistemology}}
[[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]] describes naturalism as the position that there is no higher tribunal for truth than natural science itself. In his view, there is no better method than the scientific method for judging the claims of science, and there is neither any need nor any place for a "first philosophy", such as (abstract) [[metaphysics]] or [[epistemology]], that could stand behind and justify science or the scientific method.

Therefore, philosophy should feel free to make use of the findings of scientists in its own pursuit, while also feeling free to offer criticism when those claims are ungrounded, confused, or inconsistent. In Quine's view, philosophy is "continuous with" science and ''both'' are empirical.&lt;ref name=Rudder&gt;{{cite book |title=Naturalism and the First-Person Perspective |author=Lynne Rudder |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9G_bIWzgjFkC&amp;pg=PA5 |page=5 |isbn=0199914745 |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalism is not a dogmatic belief that the modern view of science is entirely correct. Instead, it simply holds that science is the best way to explore the processes of the universe and that those processes are what modern science is striving to understand.  However, this Quinean Replacement Naturalism finds relatively few supporters among philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Feldman |first= Richard |editor-first= Edward N.
|editor-last= Zalta |editor-link= Edward N. Zalta |encyclopedia= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
|title= Naturalized Epistemology |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2012/entries/epistemology-naturalized/ |accessdate= 2014-06-04 |edition= Summer 2012 |year= 2012 |quote= Quinean Replacement Naturalism finds relatively few supporters.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Karl Popper ===
[[Karl Popper]] equated naturalism with [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] theory of science. He rejected it based on his general critique of induction (see [[problem of induction]]), yet acknowledged its utility as means for inventing conjectures.
{{quotation|A naturalistic methodology (sometimes called an "inductive theory of science") has its value, no doubt....  I reject the naturalistic view: It is uncritical. Its upholders fail to notice that whenever they believe to have discovered a fact, they have only proposed a convention. Hence the convention is liable to turn into a dogma. This criticism of the naturalistic view applies not only to its criterion of meaning, but also to its idea of science, and consequently to its idea of empirical method.|Karl R. Popper|''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''|(Routledge, 2002), pp. 52–53, {{ISBN|0-415-27844-9}}.}}
Popper instead proposed that science should adopt a methodology based on [[falsifiability]] for [[demarcation problem|demarcation]], because no number of experiments can ever prove a theory, but a single experiment can contradict one.  Popper holds that scientific theories are characterized by falsifiability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9949">'''Opinion leadership''' is leadership by an active media user who interprets the meaning of media messages or content for lower-end media users. Typically the opinion leader is held in high esteem by those who accept their [[opinion]]s. Opinion leadership comes from the theory of [[two-step flow of communication]] propounded by [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] and [[Elihu Katz]].&lt;ref name=katz1957&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Elihu| last2=Lazarsfeld | first2=Paul F. |title=Personal influence|year=1957|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|edition=E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant developers of the theory have been [[Robert K. Merton]], [[C. Wright Mills]] and [[Bernard Berelson]].&lt;ref&gt;Riesman ''et al.'' (1950) p.78&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is one of several models that try to explain the [[diffusion (business)|diffusion]] of [[diffusion of innovations|innovations]], ideas, or commercial [[product (business)|product]]s.

==Types==
Merton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Merton|first=R. K.|title=Social theory and social structure|year=1957|publisher=Free Press|location=Glencoe}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes two types of opinion leadership: monomorphic and polymorphic. Typically, opinion leadership is viewed as a monomorphic, domain-specific measure of individual differences, that is, a person that is an opinion leader in one field may be a follower in another field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Childers|first=T. L.|title=Assessment of the psychometric properties of an opinion leadership scale|journal=Journal of Marketing Research|year=1986|volume=23|pages=184–188|doi=10.2307/3172527}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flynn|first=L. R.|author2=Goldsmith, R. E. |author3=Eastman, J. K. |title=Opinion leadership and opinion seekers: Two new measurement scales|journal=Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science|year=1996|volume=24|pages=147-147|doi=10.1177/0092070396242004}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a monomorphic opinion leader in the field of computer [[technology]], might be a neighborhood computer service technician. The technician has access to far more information on this topic than the average consumer and has the requisite background to understand the information, though the same person might be a follower at another field (for example [[sports]]) and ask others for advice. In contrast, polymorphic opinion leaders are able to influence others in a broad range of domains. Variants of polymorphic opinion leadership include market mavenism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feick|first=L. F.|author2=Price, L. L.|title=The market maven: A diffuser of marketplace information|journal=Journal of Marketing|year=1987|volume=51|pages=83–97|doi=10.2307/1251146}}&lt;/ref&gt; personality strength &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weimann|first=G.|title=The influentials: Back to the concept of opinion leaders?|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1991|volume=55|issue=2|pages=267–279|doi=10.1086/269257|url=http://poq.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/2/267.short}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generalized opinion leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gnambs|first=T.|author2=Batinic, B.|title=Evaluation of measurement precision with Rasch-type models: The case of the short Generalized Opinion leadership Scale|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2011|volume=50|pages=53–58|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2010.08.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; So far, there is little consensus as to the degree these concepts operationalize the same or simply related constructs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gnambs|first=T.|author2=Batinic, B.|title=Convergent and discriminant validity of opinion leadership: Multitrait-multimethod analysis across measurement occasion and informant type|journal=Journal of Individual Differences|year=2011|volume=39|pages=94–102|doi=10.1027/1614-0001/a000040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
In his article "The Two Step Flow of Communication", [[Elihu Katz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=Elihu|title=The two-step flow of communication: An up-to-date report on an hypothesis|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1957|volume=21|pages=61–78|doi=10.1086/266687}}&lt;/ref&gt; found opinion leaders to have more influence on people's opinions, actions, and behaviors than the media.  Opinion leaders are seen to have more influence than the media for a number of reasons. Opinion leaders are seen as trustworthy and non-purposive.  People do not feel they are being tricked into thinking a certain way about something if they get information from someone they know.  However, the media can be seen as forcing a concept on the public and therefore will be less influential. While the media can act as a reinforcing agent, opinion leaders have a more changing or determining role in an individual's opinion or action.

==Factors for leadership==
In his article, [[Elihu Katz]] &lt;ref name=katz1957 /&gt; answers the question, "Who is an opinion leader?" One or more of these factors make noteworthy opinion leaders:
# expression of [[value (personal and cultural)|value]]s
# professional [[competence (human resources)|competence]]
# nature of their [[social network]].

Opinion leaders are individuals who obtain more [[media coverage]] than others and are especially educated on a certain issue.  They seek the acceptance of others and are especially motivated to enhance their [[social status]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=P.|author2=Kim, J.|title=Self-Monitoring, Opinion Leadership and Opinion Seeking: a Sociomotivational Approach |journal=Current Psychology|year=2011|volume=30|pages=203–214|doi=10.1007/s12144-011-9114-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the jargon of [[public relations]], they are called [[thought leader]]s. Research has also found that opinion leaders tend to be [[boundary spanning|boundary spanners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matous|first=P.|author2=Wang, P.|title=External exposure, boundary-spanning, and opinion leadership in remote communities: A network experiment |journal=Social Networks|year=2019|volume=56|pages=10-22|doi=10.1016/j.socnet.2018.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
In a strategic attempt to engage the public in environmental issues and his nonprofit, [[The Climate Project]], [[Al Gore]] used the concept of opinion leaders.  Gore found opinion leaders by recruiting individuals who were educated on environmental issues and saw themselves as influential in their community and amongst their friends and family.  From there, he trained the opinion leaders on the information he wanted them to spread and enabled them to influence their communities.  By using opinion leaders, Gore was able to educate and influence many Americans to take notice of climate change and change their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Nisbit| first1=Matthew C.| last2=Kotcher| first2=John E.| date=March 2009| url=http://devcompage.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Nisbet-Kotcher-Opinion-leader-campaigns-on-climate-change.pdf| title=A Two-Step Flow of Influence?: Opinion-Leader Campaigns on Climate Change| journal=Science Communication| volume=30| page=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew Nisbet describes the use of opinion leaders as intermediaries between scientists and the public as a way to reach the public via trained individuals who are more closely engaged with their communities, such as "teachers, business leaders, attorneys, policymakers, neighborhood leaders, students, and media professionals." Examples of initiatives that take this approach include Science &amp; Engineering Ambassadors, sponsored by the [[National Academy of Sciences]], and Science Booster Clubs, coordinated by the [[National Center for Science Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nisbet |first1=Matthew |title=Ambassadors for Science: Harnessing the Power of Opinion-Leaders across Communities |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=30-31 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/ambassadors_for_science |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip Crosbie Morrison''' (19 December 1900 – 1 March 1958), generally known as "Crosbie Morrison", was an [[Australia]]n [[natural history|naturalist]], educator, journalist, broadcaster and conservationist.

==Early years==
Morrison was born in [[Hawthorn, Victoria]]. He attended [[Auburn, Victoria|Auburn]] State School and [[University High School, Melbourne|University High School]]. In 1918 he became a teacher at [[Wesley College (Victoria)|Wesley College]]. He entered [[Melbourne University]] in 1921 where he studied [[zoology]], obtaining a [[BSc]] in 1924 and a [[MSc]] in 1926.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;[[Graham Pizzey|Pizzey, Graham]], 'Morrison, Philip Crosbie (1900–1958)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/morrison-philip-crosbie-11177/text19917, accessed 22 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The journalist and educator==
In 1926 Morrison joined the staff of the [[The Argus (Australia)|Melbourne Argus]] as a journalist. In 1938 he was persuaded by [[Keith Murdoch]] to accept the position of founding editor of a new monthly magazine, [[Wild Life (magazine)|''Wild Life'']].  In order to promote the magazine he also began a series of weekly radio broadcasts on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] (through [[3AR]]), [[3UZ]] and [[Mix 101.1|3DB]]. His ''Wild Life'' series on 3DB ran for over 20 years and made him an admired radio personality. It was syndicated throughout Australia on the Major Broadcasting Network. He was also a prominent panelist on 3DB's popular [[Information Please]], which was also heard Australia-wide through the Major network.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/guides/morr/serieslist.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''From Wireless to Radio. The 3DB Story'' McLaughlin, Bill, Melbourne, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II|Second World War]] he also served for a while as the Victorian state publicity censor, and later with the broadcasting division of the federal [[Department of Information (Australia)|Department of Information]], until policy disagreements forced his departure. He also worked as a lecturer in natural history with the Victorian Council of Adult Education and, from 1942, with the Australian Army Education Service.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

==The conservationist==
Morrison had long promoted the protection of wildlife and the need for proper management of national parks in his radio broadcasts and in ''Wild Life'' magazine. In 1952 he became the inaugural chairman of the newly formed [[Victorian National Parks Association]]. In 1957 he was appoionted the first director of the Victorian National Parks Authority.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

==Personal life==
Morrison married Lucy Frances Washington on 8 March 1930. He died on 1 March 1958 of a cerebral haemorrhage at his home in [[Brighton, Victoria|Brighton]], survived by his wife and two sons.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

==Honours==
* 1941-1943 – President of the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria
* 1947 – awarded the [[Australian Natural History Medallion]] by the [[Field Naturalists Club of Victoria]]
* 1949-1951 – President of the [[Royal Society of Victoria]]
* 1955-1958 – Vice-president and chairman of the [[Museum Victoria|National Museum of Victoria]]

==Publications==
Apart from numerous articles, papers and reports published in ''Wild Life'' and elsewhere, books authored by Morrison include two posthumous compilations of material from his radio broadcasts:
* 1961 – ''Along the Track with Crosbie Morrison''. Whitcombe &amp; Tombs (Australia).
* 1961 – ''Nature Talks to New Zealanders''. Whitcombe &amp; Tombs: Christchurch.

'''''Quercus suber''''', commonly called the '''cork oak''',  is a medium-sized, [[evergreen]] [[oak]] tree in the section [[Quercus section Cerris|''Quercus'' sect. ''Cerris'']]. It is the primary source of [[cork (material)|cork]] for wine bottle stoppers and other uses, such as cork flooring and as the cores of [[cricket ball]]s.  It is native to southwest Europe and northwest [[Africa]]. In the [[Mediterranean basin]] the tree is an ancient species with [[fossil]] remnants dating back to the [[Tertiary period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eriksson, E.|author2=Varela, M.C.|author3=Lumaret, R.|author4=Gil, L.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Genetic conservation of Quercus suber|publisher=European Forest Genetic Resources Programme ([[EUFORGEN]]), [[Bioversity International]]|date=2017|url=http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin/templates/euforgen.org/upload/Publications/Thematic_publications/Quercus_TB_OpenSourceCR_web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It grows to up to {{cvt|20|m}}, although it is typically more stunted in its native environment. The leaves are {{cvt|4|to|7|cm}} long, weakly lobed or coarsely toothed, dark green above, paler beneath, with the leaf margins often downcurved. The [[acorn]]s are {{cvt|2|to|3|cm}} long, in a deep cup fringed with elongated scales.

In the Portuguese town of [[Águas de Moura]] is located the Sobreiro Monumental (Monumental Cork Oak), a tree 234 years old, {{convert|16|m}} tall and with a trunk that requires at least five people to embrace it. It has been considered a National Monument since 1988, and the Guinness Book of Records states it as the largest and oldest in the world.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Ecology==
The cork oak forest is one of the major plant communities of the [[Mediterranean woodlands and forests]] [[ecoregion]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/pa1214 Mediterranean Woodland and Forest Ecoregion: Northern Africa: Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.] World Wildlife Fund. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural stands of cork oak can support [[biodiversity|diverse]] [[ecosystems]]. For example, in parts of northwestern [[North Africa]], some cork oak forests are [[habitat]] to the [[endangered]] [[Barbary macaque]], ''Macaca sylvanus'', a species whose habitat is fragmented and whose range was prehistorically much wider.&lt;ref name=hogan&gt;Hogan, C.M.
 [https://web.archive.org/web/20090831095518/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=31757 Barbary Macaque, ''Macaca sylvanus''.] GlobalTwitcher.com, Ed. N. Stromberg.&lt;/ref&gt; In Western Europe, particularly in [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], the cork oak forests are home to endangered species such as the [[Iberian lynx]], the most critically threatened feline in the world.&lt;ref name=santos&gt;Santos Pereira, J., Bugalho, M.N., and Caldeira, M.D. (2008). [http://www.apcor.pt/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/From-the-Cork-Oak-to-Cork-a-sustainable-system.pdf ''From the Cork Oak to Cork: A Sustainable Ecosystem''.] APCOR: Portuguese Cork Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[pyrophyte]], this tree has a thick, insulating bark that makes it well adapted to [[forest fire]]s. After a fire, many tree species regenerate from seeds (as, for example, the [[maritime pine]]) or resprout from the base of the tree (as, for example, the [[holm oak]]). The bark of the cork oak allows it to survive fires and then simply regrow branches to fill out the canopy. The quick regeneration of this oak makes it successful in the fire-adapted ecosystems of the [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean biome]].&lt;ref name=santos/&gt;

==Cultivation and use==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2011}}
[[File:Cork oak trunk section.jpg|thumb|A cross section of the trunk of a cork oak]]
The tree forms a thick, rugged [[Bark (botany)|bark]] containing high levels of [[suberin]]. Over time the [[cork cambium]] layer of bark can develop considerable thickness and can be harvested every 7 to 10 years to produce [[Cork (material)|cork]]. The harvesting of cork does not harm the tree (though such activity tends to reduce its life expectancy), in fact, no trees are cut down during the harvesting process. Only the bark is extracted, and a new layer of cork regrows, making it a [[renewable resource]]. The tree is cultivated in [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Tunisia]]. Cork oaks are considered to be soil builders and their fruits have been shown to have useful insecticidal properties. Cork oak forests cover approximately 25,000 square kilometres in those countries (equivalent to {{convert|2,500,000|ha}}). Portugal accounts for around 50% of the world cork harvest. Cork oaks cannot legally be cut down in Portugal, except for [[forestry|forest management]] felling of old, unproductive trees, and, even in those cases, farmers need special permission from the Ministry of Agriculture.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

''Q. suber'' is commonly grown in [[agroforestry]] systems, known as ''montado'' in [[Portugal]] and ''dehesa'' in Spain. These are open woods with low tree density (50–300 trees/ha). In these systems, [[forage]] species are commonly grown under the trees and grazed by [[cattle]] during the summer.&lt;ref name='gil08'&gt;{{citation |author=Gil, L. |author2=Varela, M. |last-author-amp=yes|title=Cork oak - ''Quercus suber'': Technical guidelines for genetic conservation and use|date=2008 |pages=6 |url=http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin//bioversity/publications/pdfs/1323_Cork_oak__Quercus_suber_.pdf |publisher=[[European Forest Genetic Resources Programme]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cork oaks commonly live more than 200 years&lt;ref name=santos/&gt;. Virgin cork (or 'male' cork) is the first cork cut from generally 25-year-old trees. Another 9 to 12 years is required for the second harvest, and a tree can be harvested about twelve times in its lifetime. Cork harvesting is done entirely without machinery, being dependent solely on human labor. Usually five people are required to harvest the tree's bark, using a small axe. The process requires training due to the skill required to harvest bark without harming the tree. The European cork industry produces 300,000 [[tonne]]s of cork a year, with a value of [[Euro|€]]1.5 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] and employing 30,000 people. [[Wine]] corks represent 15% of cork usage by weight but 66% of revenues.

The cork left after stoppers have been made is used to make a wide range of products, including insulation panels, floor and wall tiles and [[sound-proofing]] in the car industry, as well as for [[handicrafts]] and artistic uses. This include ''cork paper'', used in printing, book covering, clothing manufacture, cork ''maroquinerie'' and other products. Cork is also used in making [[cricket ball]]s, Hurling Ball (Sliothars), badminton shuttlecocks, handles of fishing rods and special devices for the [[space industry]].&lt;ref name='gil08'/&gt;

Cork oaks are sometimes planted as individual trees, providing a minor income to their owners. The tree is also sometimes cultivated for ornament. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrids]] with turkey oak (''[[Quercus cerris]]'') are regular, both in the wild in southwest Europe and in cultivation; the hybrid is known as Lucombe oak ''Quercus'' × ''hispanica''. Some cork is also produced in eastern [[Asia]] from the related Chinese cork oak (''[[Quercus variabilis]]'')

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Pathogens==
Cork oak is relatively resistant to pathogens, but some diseases occur in the species. [[Leaf spot]] can be caused by the fungus ''[[Apiognomonia errabunda]]''. Other fungi can cause leaf scorching, [[powdery mildew]], [[Rust (fungus)|rust]], and [[canker]]s.&lt;ref name=mor&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moricca |first1=Salvatore |last2=Linaldeddu |first2=Benedetto T. |last3=Ginetti |first3=Beatrice |last4=Scanu |first4=Bruno |last5=Franceschini |first5=Antonio |last6=Ragazzi |first6=Alessandro |title=Endemic and Emerging Pathogens Threatening Cork Oak Trees: Management Options for Conserving a Unique Forest Ecosystem |journal=Plant Disease |date=2016 |volume=100 |issue=11 |pages=2184–2193 |doi=10.1094/PDIS-03-16-0408-FE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most virulent cork oak pathogen may be ''[[Diplodia corticola]]'', a [[Ascomycota|sac fungus]] which causes sap-bleeding sunken canker wounds in the wood, withering of the leaves, and lesions on the acorns. The fungus ''[[Biscogniauxia mediterranea]]'' is becoming more common in cork oak forests. Its fruiting bodies appear as charcoal-black cankers. Both of these fungi are transmitted by the [[Platypus cylindrus|oak pinhole borer]] (''Platypus cylindrus''), a species of weevil.&lt;ref name=mor/&gt;

The common water mould ''[[Phytophthora cinnamomi]]'' grows in the roots of the tree and has been known to devastate cork oak woodlands.&lt;ref name=mor/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2978">The '''Shiny Brite''' company produced the most popular [[Christmas tree]] ornaments in the United States throughout the 1940s and 1950s.

In 1937, Max Eckardt established Shiny Brite ornaments, working with the [[Corning Glass]] company to [[mass production|mass-produce]] glass [[Christmas ornament]]s. Eckardt had been [[import]]ing hand-[[blown glass]] balls from [[Germany]] since around 1907, but had the foresight to anticipate a disruption in his supply from the upcoming war. Corning adapted their process for making light bulbs to making clear glass ornaments, which were then shipped to Eckardt's factories to be decorated by hand. The fact that Shiny Brite ornaments were an American-made product was stressed as a selling point during [[World War II]].

Dating of the ornaments is often facilitated by studying the hook. The first Shiny Brite ornaments had the traditional metal cap and loop, with the hook attached to the loop, from which the ornament was hung from the tree.

Wartime production necessitated the replacement of the metal cap with a [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]] tab, from which the owner would use [[yarn]] or [[Twine|string]] to hang the ornament. These hangers firmly place the date of manufacture of the ornament to the early 1940s.

Following the war, Shiny Brite introduced a line of ornaments with a newly designed metal hook that provided the user with two lengths of hanger. The long hook traveled through the center of the ornament and exited the bottom, where it attached to the foot of the ornament.  This provided the "short" hanger. Unlatched from the bottom, the entire length of the hook was available, allowing the ornament to dangle at a greater distance from the tree limb to which it was attached. This arrangement was designed to allow the ornament to fill sparsely limbed areas of a natural tree.

The increasing popularity of the aluminum [[artificial Christmas tree]], first manufactured in 1958, made this device far less attractive to the consumer, as an artificial tree had no gaps to be filled. The added expense of the lengthy hanging [[wire]] coupled with the diminishing need caused this feature to be discontinued in 1960.

During its peak, Shiny Brite had four factories in [[New Jersey]], located in the cities of [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[Irvington, New Jersey|Irvington]], [[North Bergen]], and [[West New York]]. The company's main office and [[showroom]] were located at 45 East 17th Street in [[New York city]].

Shiny Brite's most popular ornaments have been reissued under the same [[trademark]] by [[Christopher Radko]] since 2001.

[[File:Global hemispheres.svg|thumb|The Southern Hemisphere highlighted in yellow. The hemispheres appear to be unequal in this image due to [[Antarctica]] not being shown, but in reality are the same size.]]

The '''Southern Hemisphere''' is the half of [[Earth]] that is [[south]] of the [[Equator]]. It contains all or parts of five [[continent]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/imageh.htm | title=Hemisphere Map | publisher=WorldAtlas | accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Antarctica]], [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], about 90% of [[South America]], the southern third of [[Africa]], and several southern islands off the continental [[mainland]] of [[Asia]]), four [[ocean]]s ([[Indian Ocean|Indian]], [[Atlantic Ocean|South Atlantic]], [[Southern Ocean|Southern]], and [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]]) and most of the [[Pacific Islands]] in [[Oceania]]. Its surface is 80.9% water, compared with 60.7% water in the case of the Northern Hemisphere, and it contains 32.7% of Earth's land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Life on Earth: A - G.. 1|date=2002|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=9781576072868|page=528|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iVEWPg8vnxgC&amp;pg=PA528&amp;dq=southern+hemisphere+contains+%25+land#v=onepage&amp;q=southern%20hemisphere%20contains%20%25%20land&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to the tilt of [[Earth's rotation]] relative to the [[Sun]] and the [[ecliptic|ecliptic plane]], [[summer]] is from December to March and [[winter]] is from June to September. September 22 or 23 is the vernal [[equinox]] and March 20 or 21 is the autumnal equinox. The [[South Pole]] is in the center of the southern hemispherical region.

== Characteristics ==
Southern Hemisphere [[climate]]s tend to be slightly milder than those at similar latitudes in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], except in the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] which is colder than the [[Arctic]]. This is because the Southern Hemisphere has significantly more ocean and much less land; water heats up and cools down more slowly than land.&lt;ref&gt;Granite specific heat = 0.79 and water = 4.18 J/g⋅K see [[Heat capacity#Table_of_specific_heat_capacities]].&lt;/ref&gt; The differences are also attributed to oceanic heat transfer (OHT) and differing extents of greenhouse trapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kang|first1=Sarah M.|last2=Seager|first2=Richard|title=Croll Revisited: Why is the Northern Hemisphere Warmer than the Southern Hemisphere?|url=http://ocp.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/pub/seager/Kang_Seager_subm.pdf|journal=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AuroraAustralisDisplay.jpg|left|thumb|Aurora australis appearing from [[Stewart Island / Rakiura]] in the south of [[New Zealand]]]]

In the Southern Hemisphere the sun passes from east to west through the north, although north of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] the [[Mean solar time|mean sun]] can be directly overhead or due south at midday. The Sun rotating through the north causes an apparent right-left trajectory through the sky unlike the left-right motion of the Sun when seen from the Northern Hemisphere as it passes through the southern sky. Sun-cast shadows turn anticlockwise throughout the day and [[sundial]]s have the hours increasing in the anticlockwise direction. During [[solar eclipse]]s viewed from a point to the south of the Tropic of Capricorn, the Moon moves from left to right on the disc of the Sun (see, for example, photos with timings of the [[solar eclipse of November 13, 2012]]), while viewed from a point to the north of the Tropic of Cancer (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;in the Northern Hemisphere), the Moon moves from right to left during solar eclipses.

Cyclones and tropical storms spin clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere (as opposed to [[anticlockwise]] in the Northern Hemisphere) due to the [[Coriolis effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/currents/05currents1.html | title=Surface Ocean Currents | publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern [[temperateness|temperate zone]], a subsection of the Southern Hemisphere, is nearly all oceanic. This zone includes the southern tip of [[Uruguay]] and [[South Africa]]; the southern half of [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]; parts of [[Australia]], going south from [[Adelaide]], and all of [[New Zealand]].

The [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] constellation that includes the [[Milky Way|galactic centre]] is a southern constellation and this, combined with clearer skies, makes for excellent viewing of the night sky from the Southern Hemisphere with brighter and more numerous stars.

Forests in the Southern Hemisphere have special features which set them apart from those in the Northern Hemisphere. Both [[Chile]] and [[Australia]] share, for example, unique [[beech]] species or ''[[Nothofagus]]'', and [[New Zealand]] has members of the closely related genera [[Lophozonia]] and [[Fuscospora]]. The [[eucalyptus]] is native to [[Australia]] but is now also planted in [[Southern Africa]] and [[Latin America]] for pulp production and, increasingly, [[biofuel]] uses.

The most populous nation in the Southern Hemisphere is [[Indonesia]], with 261 million people (roughly 30 million of whom live north of the equator on the northern portions of the islands of [[Sumatra]], [[Borneo]] and [[Sulawesi]], while the rest of the population lives in the Southern Hemisphere). [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the most spoken language in the Southern Hemisphere,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uc.pt/international-applicants/oportunidades/linguas/economic_potential_portuguese.pdf|title=Potencial Económico da Língua Portuguesa|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Coimbra|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]]. 

The largest metropolitan areas in the Southern Hemisphere are [[São Paulo]] (21 million people), [[Jakarta]] (18 million people), [[Buenos Aires]] (12 million people), [[Rio de Janeiro]] (11 million people), [[Kinshasa]] (11 million people) and [[Sydney]] (6 million) . The most important financial and commercial centers in the Southern Hemisphere are [[São Paulo]], where the [[B3 (stock exchange)|Bovespa Index]] is headquartered, along with [[Sydney]], home to the [[Australian Securities Exchange]], [[Johannesburg]], home to the [[JSE Limited|Johannesburg Stock Exchange]] and Buenos Aires, headquarters of the [[Buenos Aires Stock Exchange]], the oldest stock market in the Southern Hemisphere.

Among the most developed nations in the Southern Hemisphere are [[Australia]], with a nominal GDP per capita of US$51,850 and a [[Human Development Index]] of 0.939, the second highest in the world as of 2016. [[New Zealand]] is also well developed, with a nominal GDP per capita of US$38,385 and a [[Human Development Index]] of 0.915, putting it at #13 in the world in 2016. The least developed nations in the Southern Hemisphere cluster in Africa and Oceania, with [[Burundi]] and [[Mozambique]] at the lowest ends of the [[Human Development Index]], at 0.404 (#184 in the world) and 0.418 (#181 in the world) respectively. The nominal GDP per capitas of these two countries don't go above US$550 per capita, a tiny fraction of the incomes enjoyed by Australians and New Zealanders.

The most widespread religions in the Southern Hemisphere are [[Christianity]] in South America, southern Africa and Australia/New Zealand, followed by [[Islam]] in most of the islands of Indonesia and in parts of southeastern Africa, and [[Hinduism]], which is mostly concentrated on the island of [[Bali]] and neighboring islands. 

The oldest continuously inhabited city in the Southern Hemisphere is [[Bogor]], in western [[Java]], which was founded in 669 CE. Ancient texts from the Hindu kingdoms prevalent in the area definitively record 669 CE as the year when Bogor was founded. However, there is some evidence that [[Zanzibar City|Zanzibar]], an ancient port with around 200,000 inhabitants on the coast of [[Tanzania]], may be older than Bogor. A Greco-Roman text written between 1 CE and 100 CE, the [[Periplus of the Erythrean Sea|''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea'']], mentioned the island of ''Menuthias'' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Μενουθιάς) as a trading port on the east African coast, which is probably the small island of [[Unguja]] on which Zanzibar is located. The oldest proven archaeological site in the Southern Hemisphere is [[Sechin Bajo]], located on the coast of northern Peru, and dates back to 3600 BCE. Sechin Bajo may also be the oldest site for monumental architecture in the Americas.

[[Image:IMG_6880_subsun.JPG|250px|thumb|Subsun]]
A '''subsun''' or ''sub-sun'' is a glowing spot that can be seen within [[cloud]]s or haze when observed from above. The subsun appears directly below the [[sun]], and is caused by its light reflecting off of numerous tiny [[ice crystal]]s suspended in the atmosphere. As such the effect belongs to the family of [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halos]]. The region of ice crystals acts as a large [[mirror]], creating a [[virtual image]] of the sun which appears below the [[horizon]], analogous to the sun's reflection in a body of water. 

The ice crystals responsible for a subsun are typically in the shape of flat hexagonal plates. As they fall through the air, their aerodynamic properties cause them to orient themselves horizontally, i.e., with their hexagonal surfaces parallel to the [[Earth|Earth's]] surface. When they are disturbed by turbulence, however, the plates start to "wobble", causing their surfaces to deviate some degrees from the ideal horizontal orientation, and causing the reflection (i.e., the subsun) to become elongated vertically. When the deviation is sufficiently large, the subsun is stretched into a vertical column known as a lower [[light pillar|sun pillar]].

'''''The Lion Children''''' is a story about a group of children who are taken to [[Botswana]] in 1995 by their mother Kate Nicholls to study the behavior of lions.  

The book was praised by British biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] who wrote a [[foreword]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins]], "I Speak of Africa and Golden Joys. Foreword to ''The Lion Children'' by Angus, Maisie and Travers McNeice", reprinted in ''[[The Devil's Chaplain: Selected Essays]]'', Phoenix, 2003 ({{ISBN|978-0-7538-1750-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; and said, "This is an astonishing book, by an even more astonishing group of children."

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;!--See [[Wikipedia talk:Featured lists]] for an explanation of this and other inclusion tags below--&gt;
The '''timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their natural satellites''' charts the progress of the discovery of new bodies over history. Each object is listed in chronological order of its discovery (multiple dates occur when the moments of imaging, observation, and publication differ), identified through its various designations (including temporary and permanent schemes), and the discoverer(s) listed.

Historically the [[naming of moons]] did not always match the times of their discovery. Traditionally, the discoverer enjoys the privilege of naming the new object; however, some neglected to do so ([[Edward Emerson Barnard|E. E. Barnard]] stated he would "defer any suggestions as to a name" [for Amalthea] "until a later paper"&lt;ref name="Barnard_1892" /&gt; but never got around to picking one from the numerous suggestions he received) or actively declined ([[Seth Barnes Nicholson|S. B. Nicholson]] stated "Many have asked what the new satellites" [Lysithea and Carme] "are to be named. They will be known only by the numbers X and XI, written in Roman numerals, and usually prefixed by the letter J to identify them with Jupiter."&lt;ref name="Nicholson_1939"&gt;{{Cite journal

The issue arose nearly as soon as planetary satellites were discovered: Galileo referred to the [[Galilean moons|four main satellites of Jupiter]] using numbers while the names suggested by his rival [[Simon Marius]] gradually gained universal acceptance. The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) eventually started officially approving names in the late 1970s.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Key ==
In the following tables, planetary satellites are indicated in bold type (e.g. '''Moon''') while planets and dwarf planets, which directly circle the Sun, are in italic type (e.g. ''Earth''). The Sun itself is indicated in roman type. The tables are sorted by publication/announcement date. Dates are annotated with the following symbols:
* ''i:'' for date of first imaging (photography, etc.);
* ''o:'' for date of first human visual observation, either through [[telescope]] or on [[photographic plate]] (the true discovery moment);
* ''p:'' for date of announcement or publication.
In a few cases, the date is uncertain and is then marked "(?)".

''* Note: Moons marked by an asterisk (*) had complicated discoveries. Some took years to be confirmed, and in several cases were actually lost and rediscovered. Others were found in [[Voyager program|Voyager]] photographs years after they were taken.''

| bgcolor="#FFD700" | In the [[geocentric model]], developed in [[Ancient Greece]], then standardized by [[Ptolemy]] in the [[2nd century]], the Earth was believed to be at the center of the cosmos. Seven planets were placed in orbit around it in an order of increasing distance from the Earth, as established by the Greek [[Stoicism|Stoics]]: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. This list included two objects, the Sun and the Moon, which are no longer considered to be planets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the 5th century BCE the Greek philosophers [[Philolaus]] and [[Hicetas]] speculated separately that the Earth was a sphere revolving daily around some mystical “central fire” that regulated the universe. [[Anaxagoras]] proposed that the Sun is a [[star]] around 450 BCE. In the 3rd century BCE, [[Aristarchus of Samos]] extended this idea by proposing that the Earth and other planets moved around a definite central object, which he believed to be the Sun though this was not widely accepted until the [[17th century]] and not proven conclusively until the [[19th century|19th]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qsunasstar.html Stanford SOLAR Center – Ask A Solar Physicist FAQs – Answer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[Aristarchus of Samos]], and later in [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]' [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric system]] (''[[De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium]]'', 1543), the Earth came to be considered a planet revolving with the other planets around the Sun, in the following order of distance from the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The Sun, now situated near the center of revolution, was no longer considered a planet.

'''West Antarctica''', or '''Lesser Antarctica''', one of the two major regions of [[Antarctica]], is the part of that continent that lies within the [[Western Hemisphere]], and includes the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. It is separated from [[East Antarctica]] by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] and is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. It lies between the [[Ross Sea]] (partly covered by the [[Ross Ice Shelf]]), and the [[Weddell Sea]] (largely covered by the [[Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf]]). It may be considered{{by whom|date=July 2016}} a giant [[peninsula]] stretching from the South Pole towards the tip of South America.

West Antarctica is largely covered by the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], but there have been signs that [[climate change]] is having some effect and that this ice sheet may have started to shrink slightly. The coasts of the Antarctic Peninsula are the only parts of West Antarctica that become (in summer) ice-free. These constitute the [[Marielandia Antarctic tundra]] and have the warmest climate in Antarctica. The rocks are clad in [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s that can cope with the intense cold of winter and the short growing-season.

==Location and description==
Lying on the [[Pacific Ocean]] side of the Transantarctic Mountains, West Antarctica comprises  the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] (with [[Graham Land]] and [[Palmer Land]]) and [[Ellsworth Land]], [[Marie Byrd Land]] and [[King Edward VII Land]], offshore islands such as [[Adelaide Island]], and [[Ice shelf|ice shelves]], notably the [[Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf]] on the [[Weddell Sea]], and the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] on the [[Ross Sea]]. The Ross Sea and the Weddell Sea separate West Antarctica from the main land-mass of the continent: one can think of West Antarctica as a giant [[peninsula]] that stretches roughly from the [[South Pole]] towards the southern tip of [[South America]].

West Antarctica was named in the early 20th century (Balch, 1902; [[Otto Nordenskiöld|Nordenskiöld]], 1905); that usage became standard following the [[International Geophysical Year]] (1957–1958) and explorations which disclosed that the Transantarctic Mountains provide a useful regional border between West Antarctica and [[East Antarctica]]. [[Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names]] (US-ACAN) approved the name in 1962.

West Antarctica is mostly covered by a massive ice sheet referred to as the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] (WAIS).  In recent decades this [[ice sheet]] has shown signs of decreasing mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6962| title= Antarctic ice sheet is an 'awakened giant'| publisher= [[New Scientist]]| date= 2 February 2005| accessdate= 2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[East Antarctica]],{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} West Antarctica has shown some [[effects of global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marielandia Antarctic tundra==
The parts of West Antarctica not covered with ice ([[Antarctic oasis]]), which are the coasts of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], constitute a [[biodiversity]] region known as Marielandia Antarctic [[tundra]] (after [[Marie Byrd Land]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{NatGeo ecoregion|id=an1101|name=Marielandia Antarctic tundra|accessdate=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area has the warmest [[Climate of Antarctica|climate in Antarctica]] and the [[moss]] and [[lichen]]-covered rocks are free of snow during the summer months, although the weather is still intensely cold and the growing season very short.

[[List of countries by natural gas proven reserves|Thailand's natural gas reserves]] are projected to run out in 2021, and Thailand began importing expensive liquefied natural gas in 2011. These factors have led to increased demand for renewable energy, and Thailand's Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP) in 2011 called for 25 percent of its energy to come from renewable sources by 2036. By June 2012, projects totalling over 1,600 MW had been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Wind Energy Outlook 2012|url=http://www.gwec.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/GWEO_2012_lowRes.pdf|publisher=Greenpeace|date=November 2012|format=PDF|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
With increasing demand for energy, Thailand found itself dependant on energy imported from other countries, mainly oil and natural gas. This, along with repeated occurrence of [[1970s energy crisis|oil crises]], raised awareness of renewable energy since The [[National Economic and Social Development Board|Fifth National Economic and Social Development Plan (1983-1987)]].&lt;ref name="eppo_history"&gt;{{Cite web|title=ประวัติการพัฒนาพลังงานของประเทศไทย |trans-title=History of energy development of Thailand |accessdate=19 Nov 2015 |url=http://www.eppo.go.th/admin/history/renewable.html |language=th |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709133052/http://www.eppo.go.th/admin/history/renewable.html |archivedate=2015-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The support for renewable energy became clear when the National Energy Policy Council Act was declared in 1992. The act started the energy conservation plan, which aimed to decrease the amount of imported energy by developing renewable energy sources in Thailand, including wind power.

===Wind resources mapping===
The first study of Thai [[Wind resource assessment|wind energy potential]] was conducted in 1975 by the Department of Energy Development and Promotion,&lt;ref name="criticalreview"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chingulpitak|first1=Sakkarin|last2=Wongwises|first2=Somchai|title=Critical review of the current status of wind energy in Thailand|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=31|year=2014|pages=312–318|format=Paywall|issn=1364-0321|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2013.11.038}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now called the [[Ministry of Energy (Thailand)|Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency]] (DEDE). Data of mean [[wind speed]] from the [[Thai Meteorological Department]] (TMD) was used to produce a [[Wind atlas|wind map]] of areas with medium to high potential. Later, in 1981, [[King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi|King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Thonburi]] (KMITT) and [[King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok|King Mongkut's Institute of Technology North Bangkok]] (KMITNB), in cooperation with [[Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand]] (EGAT), produced another wind resource map with 13 year-long data (1966-1978) from 53 wind speed measurement stations of the TMD, using [[Wind profile power law|power law]] to standardize all wind speed to 10 m. In 1984, another similar attempt was carried out by KMITT, using 17 year-long (1966-1982) data from 62 measurement stations, and with financial support from [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]].&lt;ref name="criticalreview"/&gt;

Attempts at producing wind resource maps of Thailand all faced the problem of shortage in wind speed data, especially offshore and at high elevations.&lt;ref name="www2_E"&gt;{{cite web| first = Somchai | last = Phupongpaibul|title=Wind Resource Assessment of Thailand| accessdate = 15 November 2015| url = http://www2.dede.go.th/dede/renew/Twm/REPORT.htm| language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in maps with low coverage. In 2001, another set of wind resource maps was produced by DEDE using data from over 150 [[Weather station|measurement stations]] including offshore stations and high elevation stations. The data was processed using computer simulation and mathematical modelling, and the map and data were also published in electronic form. In the same year, the [[World Bank]] offered another set of wind resource maps for four countries: Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand, which was calculated from global wind data and each country's geographical data using computer simulations.&lt;ref name=WB&gt;{{Cite web | title = Wind Energy Resource Atlas of Southeast Asia| publisher = The World Bank Asia Alternative Energy Program |date = September 2001 | accessdate = 2016-09-29 | url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTEAPASTAE/Resources/wind_atlas_complete.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, wind speed data in [[southern Thailand]] was further calibrated with the setup of more stations in six provinces of southern Thailand.&lt;ref name="criticalreview"/&gt; Southern Thailand was shown in previous studies to have the highest wind energy potential in Thailand. The stations were installed to measure wind speeds at 80, 90, and 100 m heights. Also, from 2007 to 2009 wind speed and direction were measured and recorded from several stations in the northern Thailand.

In 2011, research to improve the wind map was conducted by the Department of Physics of [[Silpakorn University]].&lt;ref name="worrapass_thesis"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Promsen |first=Worrapass |date=2011 |title=Development of Windmap for Thailand by Using Atmospheric Mesoscale Model |type=Dissertation |publisher=Silpakorn University |url=http://www.thapra.lib.su.ac.th/objects/thesis/fulltext/snamcn/Worrapass_Promsen_Doctor/fulltext.pdf |access-date=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research produced [[Mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] wind maps with resolution of 3x3 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cells using atmospheric model and computer simulation software, and also experimented with the making of [[Microscale meteorology|microscale]] wind maps, which could be the next step in the study of Thai wind energy potential.

===Wind turbines===
In 1983, Thailand had its first set of electricity generating [[wind turbine]]s, consisting of six turbines, installed at Laem Phromthep in [[Phuket Province]] by EGAT as a pilot project.&lt;ref name="criticalreview"/&gt; The generated electricity was used to power nearby research stations. The outcome was satisfying, so in 1988 EGAT planned to connect the turbines to the power grid of the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA), and in 1990 they started operating. This was the first time Thailand had electricity generated by wind power supplying the power grid. Later, in 1992, two more turbines with 10&amp;nbsp;kW of [[Nameplate capacity|capacity]] were installed and connected to the grid.&lt;ref name="criticalreview"/&gt;

Later, both government and private organizations, especially educational institutes, had more interest in the potential in wind power in Thailand. In 1996, KMUTT was the first organization to install 2.5&amp;nbsp;kW and 10&amp;nbsp;kW wind turbines at [[Phu Kradueng National Park]] in [[Loei Province]], and [[Tarutao National Marine Park]] in [[Satun Province]]. Later in the same year, the Recycle Engineering Company Limited installed one 150&amp;nbsp;kW wind turbine at its facility at [[Ko Chang District]] in [[Chonburi Province]], becoming Thailand's first private wind turbine.

On the government side, in 2007, DEDE installed wind turbine of 250&amp;nbsp;kW capacity at [[Hua Sai District]] in [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Province]], and later in 2009, another of 1.5 MW capacity. Also in 2009, two wind turbines of 1.25 MW capacity each were installed by EGAT at the upper reservoir of [[Lam Takhong Dam|Lam Takhong Cholapawattana power plant]], a hydroelectric power plant in [[Sikhio District]], [[Nakhon Ratchasima Province]], becoming Thailand’s first large electricity-generating wind power plant.

==Wind resources==
Thailand has relatively low average [[wind speed]]s with most areas being of class 1-1.4 wind speed, or about 2.8–4&amp;nbsp;m/s measured at 10 m. This is because Thailand is near the equator which has generally low wind speed.&lt;ref name="criticalreview"/&gt; In general, Thailand's inland winds are sub-par, but there are areas with [[topography]] such as mountain ranges, canyons, and slopes that help increase wind speeds. 

A study conducted in 2001 for the World Bank found limited potential for large-scale wind power in Thailand. On a land area basis, only 761 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 0.2 percent of Thailand's land mass was found to have "good to excellent" winds.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt;{{RP|vii}} Prospects for small-scale village wind power were found to be more promising. Seventy-three percent of the rural population lived in areas with "fair to good" wind resources.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt;{{RP|18}} 

Nevertheless, Thailand still has some areas with utilizable wind speeds of no less than class 3, that is, with no lower than 6.4&amp;nbsp;m/s annual average wind speed.&lt;ref name="criticalreview"/&gt; This is caused by the two [[monsoon]]s that [[Geography of Thailand#Climate|affect Thailand]] annually, the northeast monsoon and the southwest monsoon. The northeast monsoon comes from the South China Sea during the period between November and March, producing strong wind in the Gulf of Thailand and the coastal areas of southern Thailand. The southwest monsoon comes from the Indian Sea between May and October, producing strong wind at the peaks of mountain ranges in the west part of upper southern and lower northern Thailand.

For [[Offshore wind power|offshore wind]], there are some areas with high wind speeds in [[Bandon Bay]] in [[Surat Thani Province]], Pattani Gulf in [[Songkhla Province|Songkhla]], and [[Pattani Province]], and [[Songkhla Lake]] (actually a lagoon) in Songkhla Province.&lt;ref name="criticalreview"/&gt;

As of the end of 2014, Thailand's wind power capacity stood at 224.5 MW, generating 305 GWh of energy throughout the year. This ranks Thailand 46th in the world by wind power capacity.&lt;ref name="gwec_stat2014"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Global Wind Statistics 2014| publisher=Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC)|location=Brussels|date=2015-02-10 | accessdate = 15 November 2015 | url = http://www.gwec.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GWEC_GlobalWindStats2014_FINAL_10.2.2015.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spikes in increase in capacity in 2012 and 2013 were caused by the construction of "First Korat Wind" wind farm and "K.R. Two" wind farm by Wind Energy Holding Co., Ltd., founded by [[Nopporn Suppipat]], in each year, respectively. Each wind farm is composed of 45 wind turbines, each with 2.3 MW capacity, resulting in wind farms with highest capacities in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="criticalreview"/&gt;

==Future plans==
The latest plan to develop alternative energy in Thailand is the Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP). The plan aims to increase the share of renewable energy in the total energy production to 25 percent.&lt;ref name="webe_The1"&gt;{{Cite web | title = The 10-Year Alternative Energy Development Plan| accessdate = 15 November 2015 | url = http://weben.dede.go.th/webmax/content/10-year-alternative-energy-development-plan }}&lt;/ref&gt; The share of renewable energy stands at 11.91 percent as of 2014.&lt;ref name="TAES2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aedp"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP) 2015 | author = Yaowateera Achawangkul, PhD | date = 4 June 2015 | accessdate = 15 November 2015 | url = http://www.renewableenergy-asia.com/Portals/0/seminar/Presentation/04-Overview%20of%20Alternative%20Energy%20Development%20Plan%20(AEDP%202015).pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly, the AEDP was planned to span 2012 to 2021 and to employ an Adder system: subsidies for independent sales of wind power from small and very small power producers, aiming to promote electricity generation from wind power. However, under the lead of Prime Minister General Prayut Chan-o-cha, the plan was revised to span 2015 to 2036.&lt;ref name="aedp"/&gt; FiT (Feed-in-tariff) system is used instead of Adder, which calculates sales price of energy from real development cost of the energy producer, but with premium extra rate of 0.50 baht/kWh for the [[South Thailand insurgency|southern border provinces]].&lt;ref name="eppo_fit"&gt;{{Cite web | title = นโยบายการรับซื้อไฟฟ้าจากพลังงานหมุนเวียนในรูปแบบ Feed-in Tariff |trans-title=policy on purchase of electricity from renewable energy in form of Feed-in-Tariff system| work = eppo.go.th | accessdate = 15 November 2015 | url = http://www.eppo.go.th/power/fit-seminar/Fit_2558.pdf | language = th }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prevents the price of energy from increasing too much.

Also, Energy Absolute Public Company Limited, headed by Somphote Ahunai, is constructing three wind farm projects in [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Province]] with combined installed capacity of 126 MW. It also plans to start construction of five more projects in 2017 in [[Chaiyaphum Province]], northeast Thailand, which will produce 260 MW of electricity.&lt;ref name="EA"&gt;{{Cite web | title = EA :: ENERGY ABSOLUTE PUBLIC COMPANY LIMITED :: Wind | work = energyabsolute.co.th | accessdate = 15 November 2015 | url = http://www.irplus.in.th/Listed/EA/wind.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://renewablesnow.com/news/thai-wind-project-of-260-mw-on-sor-por-kor-land-to-move-on-report-564239/&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, total capacity of proposed big scale wind farm projects that are accepted by the government amounts to 787.37 MW, with 1674.20 MW more yet to be confirmed.&lt;ref name="eppo_factsheet"&gt;{{Cite report | title = สถานการณ์รับซื้อไฟฟ้าจากพลังงานลม ณ 31 ธันวาคม 2555 |trans-title=electricity from wind power purchase situation 2012| work = eppo.go.th |publisher = Energy Policy and Planning Office| date = 31 December 2012 | accessdate = 15 November 2015 | url = http://www.eppo.go.th/power/powerN/PICP/File/(11)/factsheet_ลม.pdf | language = th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
===Cost of production===
According to a research study by [[King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi]],&lt;ref name="economickmutt"&gt;{{cite thesis |last1=Kunshornrat |first1=Chantana |last2=Hajbulla |first2=Salwanee |date=2010 |title=การวิเคราะห์ทางเศรษฐศาสตร์และประเมินต้นทุนของการผลิตไฟฟ้าด้วยพลังงานลม |trans-title=Economic analysis and cost assessment of wind power generation |publisher=[[King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi]] |language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt; the cost of wind energy production in Thailand ranges from about 2-6 baht/kWh, but in some unsuitable areas the cost can be as high as 11 baht/kWh. When compared to the cost of production in Denmark at about 45 øre (about 2.36 baht) /kWh, Thailand's cost is relatively higher. But with PEA buying electricity with FiT system at the typical rate of about six baht/kWh, production by very small power producers (VSPP) is possible.

===Investment===
As a result of the government's continuous supporting policy, renewable energy consumption has grown dramatically. This leads to an increase in investments from private organizations in [[renewable energy industry]]. Most recently in 2014, combined net value of investment in renewable energy both from the government and private organizations amounted to 84,588 million baht.&lt;ref name="TAES2014"/&gt; Of this amount, the wind energy industry received the highest proportion of the investment, amounting to 25,720 million baht or 30.4 percent of total investment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9507">{{short description|A terrane extending from south-central Alaska through southwestern Yukon and along the Coast of British Columbia}}
The '''Wrangellia Terrane''' (named for the [[Wrangell Mountains]], Alaska) is a [[terrane]] extending from the south-central part of [[Alaska]] through southwestern [[Yukon]] and along the [[British Columbia Coast|Coast of British Columbia]] in [[Canada]]. Some workers contend that Wrangellia extends southward to [[Oregon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sarewitz|1983|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is not generally accepted.

==Extent and terminology==
The term Wrangellia is confusingly applied to all of: the Wrangell(ia) Terrane alone; a composite [[terrane]] (CT) consisting of the [[Wrangell Terrane]], [[Peninsular Terrane]], and other rock units that were not originally part of the [[North American craton]]; and a composite terrane which also includes the [[Alexander Terrane]]. Earlier workers sometimes used the term, "[[Talkeetna Mountains|Talkeetna]] Superterrane," to describe Wrangellia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wallace|Hanks|Rogers|1989|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
There are two conflicting hypotheses whether the Wrangellia Superterrane originated at polar or equatorial latitudes.  One hypothesis proposes that Wrangellia accreted at a northerly latitude near it current location (when North America, or Laurentia, was located farther east as part of Pangaea), the other that it originated {{Circa}} {{Convert|3000|km|abbr=on}} south of its current location, approximately where Baja California is now located.  The former hypothesis is favoured in most plate tectonic reconstructions since the latter introduces rapid, implausible displacements of Wrangellia across the Panthalassic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nokleberg|Parfenov|Monger|Norton|1998|loc=Paleomagnetic Dilemma: Loci of Accretion of Wrangellia Superterrane, pp. 9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern hypothesis===
Rocks of Wrangellia (the individual terrane, not the CT) were originally created in the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] to the [[Jurassic]] somewhere, but probably near the equator, in the [[Panthalassic Ocean]] off of the west coast of the North American craton as [[island arc]]s, [[oceanic plateau]]s, and rock assemblages of the associated tectonic settings. Although composed of many different rocks types, of various composition, age, and tectonic affinity, it is the Late [[Triassic]] [[flood basalt]]s that are the defining unit of Wrangellia. These [[basalt]]s, extruded onto land over 5-million years about 230 million years ago, on top of an extinct Pennsylvanian and [[Permian]] island arc, constitute a [[large igneous province]], currently exposed in a {{convert|2500|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|Schmidt|2002|loc=Abstract}}; {{Harvnb|Greene|Scoates|Weis|Israel|2004|loc=Introduction, p. 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wrangellia collided and amalgamated with the Alexander Terrane by Pennsylvanian time. By the end of the Triassic, the Peninsular Terrane had also joined the Wrangellia CT. A subduction zone existed on the west side of Wrangellia. Seafloor rocks too light to be subducted were instead compressed against the western edge of Wrangellia; these rocks are now known as the [[Chugach Terrane]]. A complex fault system, known as the Border Ranges Fault, is the modern expression of the suture zone between Wrangellia and Chugach Terranes. Over time, [[plate tectonics]] moved this amalgamation of crust generally northeastward into contact with the North American continental margin. The Wrangellia CT collided with and docked to North America by [[Cretaceous]] time.  [[Strike slip fault|Strike-slip]] displacement, with Wrangellia travelling northward, continued after docking, although the amount of post-[[Accretion (geology)|accretion]] displacement is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nokleberg|Jones|Silberling|1985|loc=Abstract}}; {{Harvnb|Trop|Ridgway|Manuszak|Layer|2002|loc=Abstract}}; {{Harvnb|Israel|2009|loc=Abstract}}; {{Harvnb|Greene|Scoates|Weis|2005|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
