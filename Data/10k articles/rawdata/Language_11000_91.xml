      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3626">'''ALPAC''' ('''Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee''') was a committee of seven scientists led by [[John R. Pierce]], established in 1964 by the [[United States government]] in order to evaluate the progress in [[computational linguistics]] in general and [[machine translation]] in particular. Its report, issued in 1966, gained notoriety for being very skeptical of research done in machine translation so far, and emphasizing the need for basic research in computational linguistics; this eventually caused the U.S. government to reduce its funding of the topic dramatically.

The ALPAC was set up in April 1964 with John R. Pierce as the chairman.

The committee consisted of:
# [[John R. Pierce]], who at the time worked for [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]]
# [[John B. Carroll]], a psychologist from [[Harvard University]]
# [[Eric P. Hamp]], a linguist from the [[University of Chicago]]
# [[David G. Hays]], a Machine Translation researcher from [[RAND Corporation]]
# [[Charles F. Hockett]], a linguist from [[Cornell University]]
# [[Anthony G. Oettinger]], a Machine Translation researcher from Harvard University
# [[Alan Perlis]], an Artificial Intelligence researcher from [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]]

Testimony was heard from:
* Paul Garvin of [[Bunker-Ramo Corporation]]
* Gilbert King of Itek Corporation and previously from [[IBM]]
* Winfred P. Lehmann from [[University of Texas]]
* Jules Mersel of Bunker-Ramo Corporation

ALPAC's final recommendations (p.&amp;nbsp;34) were, therefore, that research should be supported on:

# practical methods for evaluation of translations;
# means for speeding up the human translation process;
# evaluation of quality and cost of various sources of translations;
# investigation of the utilization of translations, to guard against production of translations that are never read;
# study of delays in the over-all translation process, and means for eliminating them, both in journals and in individual items;
# evaluation of the relative speed and cost of various sorts of machine-aided translation;
# adaptation of existing mechanized editing and production processes in translation;
# the over-all translation process; and
# production of adequate reference works for the translator, including the adaptation of glossaries that now exist primarily for automatic dictionary look-up in machine translation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1439">An '''additur''' ([[Latin]]: "it is added to") is a [[legal term]] referring to the practice of a [[trial]] [[judge]] adding damages additional to the original amount awarded by the [[jury]]. It is not allowed in [[U.S. federal courts]], as held by ''Dimick vs. Schiedt'', 293 U.S. 474 (1935).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.findlaw.com/us/293/474.html |title=Dimick v.

Tompkins]]'' (1938), which given the rarity of additur makes it unclear whether federal courts are bound by this rule when [[Erie doctrine|applying state law]] in [[diversity jurisdiction|diversity cases]].

Some [[United States|American states]], on the other hand, allow the practice, including [[California]] and [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Fisch v.

Although this is a rarely used procedure, it is usually granted for punitive damages when it is used in state courts.

'''Andi''' is a [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian language]] belonging to the [[Avar–Andic languages|Avar–Andic]] branch spoken by about 5,800 ethnic [[Andi (people)|Andi]] (2010) in the [[Botlikh people|Botlikh]] region of [[Dagestan]]. The language is spoken in the villages [[Andi village|Andi]] (along the river [[Andi-Koisu]]),&lt;ref name="Redbook"&gt;[http://www.eki.ee/books/redbook/akhvakhs.shtml The peoples of the Red Book: Akhvakhs]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gunkha village|Gunkha]], [[Gagatl village|Gagatl]], [[Ashali village|Ashali]], [[Rikvani village|Rikvani]], [[Chanko village|Chanko]], [[Zilo village|Zilo]], and [[Kvanxidatl village|Kvanxidatl]].&lt;ref name="Alekseev,M.E." /&gt;

There are four main dialects, [[Munin dialect|Munin]], [[Rikvani]], [[Kvanxidatl]], and [[Gagatl]], which appear quite divergent.  However, the dialects can be said to vary between villages: the "upper-group" contains Andi, Gagatl, Rikvani, and Zilo (where Andi and Zilo are considered their own dialects), whereas the "lower-group" contains [[Munin village|Munin]] and Kvanxidatl. The upper-group lacks the affricate sound '''кьI'''.&lt;ref name="Alekseev,M.E." /&gt;

Although Andi is usually non written, there are attempts to write the language using Russian Cyrillic script. Speakers generally use [[Avar language|Avar]] or [[Russian language|Russian]] as their literary language(s).&lt;ref name="e19" /&gt;

Andi has 7 different series of localization: the meaning "inside" changes by number (singular '''-ла/-а''', plural '''-хъи''': '''гьакъу-ла''' 'in a home', '''гьакъоба-хъи''' 'in houses'). Number categories are expressed through [[ablaut]] ('''имуво воцци в-усон''' 'The father found the brother', but '''имуво воццул в-осон''' 'The father found the brothers'). In the village [[Анди village|Andi]], there is a difference between the speech of men and women; a man will say, for example, '''дин''' meaning 'I', "мин" meaning 'you', '''гьекIа''' 'person', but a woman will say '''ден''' 'I', '''мен''' 'you', '''гьекIва''' 'person'.&lt;ref name="Alekseev,M.E." /&gt;

==Phonology==

Andi has 43 consonants:

* 5 labial consonants (b - p - p' - v - m),
* 10 dental consonants (d - t - t' - ts' - ts': - ts - z - s - s: - n),
* 9 alveolar consonants (dž - .č - .č: - č - č: - ž - š - š: - r),
* 4 lateral consonants (ķł - ķł: - ł - l),
* 7 velar consonants (g - ķ - ķ: - k - k: - x – j),
* 6 uvular consonants (q' – q': - q - ġ - ҳ - ҳ:)
* 2 laryngeal consonants (ъ – h).

There are 5 vowels: a - e (é) - i - o - u (ou).

An '''Anglicism''' is a word or construction borrowed from [[English language|English]] into another language.

With the rise in [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] media and global spread of British and American cultures in the 20th and 21st centuries, many English terms have entered popular usage in other tongues. Technology-related English words like ''internet'' and ''computer'' are particularly common across the globe, as there are no pre-existing words for them. English words are sometimes imported verbatim, and sometimes adapted to the importing language in a process similar to anglicisation. In languages with non-[[Latin alphabet]]s, these borrowed words can be written in the Latin alphabet anyway, resulting in a text made up of a mixture of scripts; other times they are [[transliteration|transliterated]]. Transliteration of English and other foreign words into [[Japanese language|Japanese]] generally uses the [[katakana]] script.

In some countries such anglicisation is seen as relatively benign, and the use of English words may even take on a ''[[chic (style)|chic]]'' aspect. In [[Japan]], [[marketing]] products for the domestic market often involves using English or [[Japlish|pseudo-English]] [[brand name]]s and [[slogan]]s. In other countries, anglicisation is seen much more negatively, and there are efforts by public-interest groups and governments to reverse the trend; for example, the [[Académie française]] in [[France]] insists on the use of French [[neologism]]s to describe technological inventions in place of imported English terms.

It is also important to note that while Anglicism is fundamentally rooted in the word English, the process does not necessarily denote anglicisms from England. It can also involve terms or words from all varieties of English so that it becomes necessary to use the term Americanism for the loan words originating from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anglicisms in Europe: Linguistic Diversity in a Global Context|last=Fischer|first=Roswitha|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2010|isbn=9781443825184|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adaptation ==
A number of scholars agree that in order for Anglicism to take place, adaptation must first occur such as in the case of the integration of a great number of Anglicisms in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The English Language in Europe|last=Hartmann|first=Reinhard|publisher=Intellect Books|year=1996|isbn=9781871516890|location=Oxford|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer said that it is similar to neologism in the sense that it completes several phases of integration, which include: 1) the beginning, when it is still new and not known to many speakers; 2) the phase where it begins to spread and take part in the process of institutionalization; and, 3) the word becomes part of the common core of the language.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; There are experts who propose a more detailed framework such as the model of Anglicism adaptation that transpires on four levels: orthographic, phonological, morphological, and semantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On Languages and Language: The Presidential Adresses of the 1991 Meeting of the Societas Linguistica Europaea|last=Winter|first=Werner|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2011|isbn=9783110881318|location=Berlin|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anglicisms in Chinese==
These are English terms, expressions, or concepts that have been absorbed into the [[Chinese language]], including any of [[Varieties of Chinese|its varieties]], and should not be confused with [[Chinglish]], the variety of the English language used by native Chinese speakers.

The origins of Chinese anglicisms vary, one of the most common being those obtained by [[phonetic]] borrowing. For example, a "[[wikt:bus|bus]]" ({{zh|first=t|t=公共汽車|s=公共汽车|l=public vehicle}}, in [[Mainland China]] or [[Taiwan]]) is usually called {{zh|labels=no|c="巴士"|j=(baa&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; si&lt;sup&gt;6-2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macao]] because its [[Cantonese]] pronunciation is similar to its English counterpart. Another type of anglicism is syntactic anglicism, when a sentence is rendered following the English [[word order]] instead of the [[standard Chinese]] word order; for example, the word for "[[wikt:network|network]]" is {{zh|s=网络|t=(網絡)|labels=no}} or {{zh|s=网路|t=(網路)|labels=no}}, where {{zh|s=网|t=(網)|labels=no}} can be translated as "net".

--&gt;

==Anglicisms in French==
{{See also|Franglais}}

A distinction is made between well-established English borrowings into French, and other words and structures regarded as incorrect. The term ''anglicisme'' is often pejorative, carries a large amount of political weight, and frequently denotes an excessive use of English in the French language.

There are many words in French of English origin whose English roots are unknown or unrecognized due to lack of salience or length of time since borrowing (ex: ''gouvernement''), as well as other words which are seen as English but that are well accepted as part of French (ex: ''parking'', ''week-end''). Other examples include ''clown'' (pronounced "kloon"), ''square'' (meaning "public square") or ''spleen'' (meaning "[[Melancholia|melancholy]]" rather than the organ). These are not considered Anglicisms but are fully accepted as French words by the Académie française.

Occasionally governments and linguistic institutions of both [[Quebec]] and [[France]] have undertaken strenuous efforts to eradicate Anglicisms, often by suggesting French replacements with French phonology and morphology. Although efforts in Quebec have been met with some success (ex: ''fin de semaine'' for week-end), attempts by the [[Académie française]] have largely been unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On ne parle pas franglais: la langue française face à l'anglais|last=Bogaards|first=Paul|publisher=De Boeck Duculot|year=2008|isbn=978-2-8011-1417-9|location=Brussels|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociolinguists have attributed these failures to the general inability of linguistic institutions to enforce a linguistic norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bécherel|first=Danièle|year=1981|title=A propos des solutions de remplacements des anglicismes|url=|journal=La Linguistique|volume=17|issue=2|pages=119–131|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Académie française regularly updates a list of prescribed linguistic norms, many of which include using suggested French replacements instead of anglicisms (ex: ''mot-dièse'' for ''hashtag'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.academie-francaise.fr/la-langue-francaise/terminologie-et-neologie|title=Dire, ne pas dire|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Academie Francaise|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Replacements have taken many different forms. For example, in Quebec the [[portmanteau]] word ''clavardage'' is increasingly gaining acceptance. This [[neologism]] is a word coined from the words ''clavier'' ("keyboard") and ''bavardage'' ("chat").  Other replacements have various forms created by the academy and Quebecois linguistic institutions.

[[Quebec French]] and [[European French (disambiguation)|European French]] tend to have entirely different Anglicisms for historical reasons. Quebec French acquired its Anglicisms in a gradual process of linguistic borrowing resulting from linguistic contact with English speakers for two and a half centuries since the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] of 1759. European French, on the other hand, mostly adopted its Anglicisms in recent decades due to the post-[[Second World War]] international dominance of English, or the rise of [[English as a lingua franca]]. Due to the differences between in English borrowings in Canada and France, the people of Quebec and France often consider each other's anglicisms to be incorrect or humorous while considering their own to be perfectly normal.

An example of a European French Anglicism not used in [[Quebec]]:
* ''sweat'': short for ''sweatshirt'', but pronounced like the English word "sweet"
An example of a Quebec French Anglicism not used in [[France]];
* ''frencher'': to [[French kiss]]

Furthermore, the social meaning and acceptance of anglicisms differs from country to country due to the differences in the historical relationship to French. In Quebec, anglicisms are never used in formal documentation (government papers, instruction sheets) and very rarely used in informal writing ([[magazines]], [[Diary|journals]]). In 1993, the French passed the legislation Loi [[Toubon Law|Toubon]] which forbids the use of anglicisms (or those from other languages) in common publications. In both countries, wherever the use of an Anglicism is unavoidable, it is often written in [[Italic type|italics]] or in quotations.

There are a number of different varieties of anglicisms which are largely differentiated on the way in which they entered the language. One type of anglicism is a [[calque]], or a direct translation from English. For example, the [[valediction]] ''Sincèrement vôtre'' is regarded as an anglicism since it is a direct translation of the English "Sincerely yours." Other anglicisms include the wholesale adoption of the English term such as "business" or "start-up". Additionally, some English words in French may not have the same meaning as those words in English. One example is the word "golf" which has an increased [[semantic field]], referring to not just the game of golf but also a golf course as in "on va aller au golf" (trans: we're going to the golf course).

It must be noted that anglicism is a political term and does not necessarily indicate the etymology or history of the word itself. Rather, it indicates the common attitudes and perceptions about the (theoretically English) history of the word. For example, because English itself borrowed a great amount of French vocabulary after the [[Norman Conquest]], some anglicisms are actually [[Old French]] words that dropped from usage in French over the centuries but were preserved in English and have now come full circle back into French. For instance, one attested origin of the verb "to flirt" cites influence from the Old French expression ''conter fleurette'', which means "to (try to) seduce". (Other possible origins for the word include ''flit'', E. Frisian ''flirt'' (a flick or light stroke) and E. Frisian ''flirtje'' (a giddy girl)). This expression is no longer used in French, but the English [[Gallicism]] "to flirt" has now returned to French and is considered an anglicism, despite its likely French origins.

==Anglicisms in German==
{{main|Denglisch}}
[[Denglisch]] (German spelling) or Denglish (English spelling) is a portmanteau of ''Deutsch'' and ''Englisch'' (the German words for the German and English languages). The term is used in all German-speaking countries to refer to the increasingly strong influx of English or pseudo-English vocabulary into German. Denglish is also used to refer to incorrect English that is influenced by German.
To some extent, the influence of English on German can be from normal language contact. The term Denglisch is however mostly reserved for forced, excessive exercises in anglicization, or pseudo-anglicization, of the German language.

==Anglicisms in Latvian ==
The first anglicisisms in the written sources of [[Latvian language|Latvian]] appear at the end of the 18th century, however, up until the middle 1970s they were barely researched as their number remained low and since they mostly appeared in the terminology of [[sports]] and [[engineering]]. The direct contact between Latvian and English at that time was very limited, thus most of the anglicisms entered Latvian through [[German language|German]] or [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Anglicismi latviešu valodā |trans-title=Anglicisms in the Latvian language |first=Juris |last=Baldunčiks |url=http://gramatas.lndb.lv/periodika2-viewer/view/index-dev.html#panel:pp%7cissue:/g_001_0304059354%7carticle:DIVL702%7cpage:6%7cissueType:B |year=1989 |publisher=[[Zinātne]] |location=Riga |isbn=5-7966-0078-8 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since Latvia regained its independence, there has been an influx of anglicisms into the Latvian language due to the fact that media in English is more accessible than ever.

==Anglicisms in Polish==
{{See also|Poglish}}
Sporadic linguistic contacts between Polish and English-speaking areas have been noted at least since the 15th century. However, most early Anglicisms in Polish were mostly limited to names for places in Great Britain and the Americas.&lt;ref name="Mańczak-Wohlfeld"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Elżbieta Mańczak-Wohlfeld |coauthors= |editor=Janusz Arabski |others= |title=Angielsko-polskie kontakty językowe |trans-title=Anglo-Polish Language Contacts |url= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Jagiellonian University]] Press |location=Kraków |isbn=83-233-2132-9 |oclc= |pages=17–43 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first proper Anglicisms were also related to geography and were recorded in an 18th-century work "Geografia, czyli opisanie naturalne, historyczne i praktyczne krajów we czterech częściach się zawierające" by [[Franciszek Siarczyński]]. By the end of that century there were at least 21 [[lexeme]]s of English provenance in Polish usage. The 1859 dictionary of foreign words by [[Michał Amszejewicz]] contains roughly 100 Anglicisms, the so-called Vilnian dictionary of 1861 contains roughly 180 of such words.&lt;ref name="Mańczak-Wohlfeld-32"&gt;Mańczak-Wohlfeld, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The Anglicisms recorded in the 19th century were in large part words related to social, political, legal and economic concepts used in English society and lacking corresponding institutions in contemporary Poland. Another group were naval, sports-related and technical terms.&lt;ref name="Mańczak-Wohlfeld"/&gt;

Typically new words were initially being written in their original form, especially when they were used to describe English or American contexts. Such was the case of the word ''[[budget]]'', first recorded as such in 1792 in relation to English economy, but soon also used in Polish context.&lt;ref name="JP"&gt;{{cite journal | author =Elżbieta Mańczak-Wohlfeld | year =1987 | month = | title =Najstarsze zapożyczenia angielskie w polszczyźnie | journal =Język polski | volume =67 | issue = | pages = | issn = | url =http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~hjp/teksty/Wohl1.pdf | format = | accessdate =2013-06-18 |language=pl |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924105655/http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~hjp/teksty/Wohl1.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With time the word was assimilated and remains in modern Polish dictionaries, written as ''budżet''. Early 19th century Dictionary of the Polish Language by [[Samuel Linde]] includes the following Anglicisms: foksal (after London's suburb of [[Vauxhall]]; meaning an evening garden party in contemporary Polish), [[gallon|galon]], [[Club (organization)|klub]], [[quaker|kwakier]], [[picnic|piknik]], [[Punch (drink)|poncz]], [[rum]] and [[English porter|porter]].&lt;ref name="JP"/&gt;

The assimilation of new English words into Polish sped up in the 20th century and gradually English replaced Czech, German, French, Italian and other languages as the primary source of new imports into the Polish language.&lt;ref name="Hemmert"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Alexandra Hemmert |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Zmiany w użyciu anglicyzmów w jzyku polskim na przestrzeni ostatnich 15 lat |trans-title= |url= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2008 |publisher=[[University of Leipzig]], GRIN |location=Leipzig |isbn=978-3-638-90908-2 |oclc= |pages=10–11 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the century there were roughly 250 English words in use, by 1961 the number of English lexemes in Polish rose to over 700, breaking 1000 lexemes in the 1980s and at least 1600 in 1994.&lt;ref name="Hemmert"/&gt;

Borrowings from English language used in modern Polish fall into a number of thematic categories:
* Science and technology: [[Flash (photography)|flesz]], [[compact disc|kompakt]], [[computer|komputer]], [[Shipping container|kontener]], [[stress (psychological)|stres]], [[Market trend|trend]], [[walkman]] (used as a generic word for personal stereo rather than a trademark);
* Sports and healthcare: aerobic, lifting, jogging, peeling, [[Throw-in|aut]], [[badminton]], [[backhand|bekhend]], [[bobsled|bobslej]], [[Types of tennis match#Doubles|debel]], [[derby]], [[wikt:doping|doping]], [[jockey]], [[forehand|forhend]], [[hockey|hokej]], [[leader|lider]], [[match|mecz]], [[net (device)|net]], outsider, [[ring (boxing)|ring]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[Tennis|set]], [[tennis|tenis]], [[Walkover (contest)|walkover]];
* Computers: [[Device driver|driver]], [[joystick]], [[Mouse (computing)|mysz]] (a semantic blueprint), [[server (computing)|serwer]], [[Image scanner|skaner]], [[spam (electronic)|spam]];
* Economy: [[budget|budżet]], [[business|biznes]], [[businessman|biznesmen]], [[broker]], [[discount store|dyskont]], [[holding company|holding]], [[leasing]], [[joint venture]], [[Management|menadżer]], [[marketing]], [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]], [[supermarket]];
* Fashion: [[jersey|dżersey]], [[jeans|dżins]], [[lycra]], [[Toplessness|topless]];
* Politics: [[lobbying|lobby]], establishment
* Daily life: baby-sitter, happy end, logo, marker, market, notebook, puzzle, ranking, snack bar, scrabble, show, teflon, weekend;
* Maritime terms: [[keel|kil]], [[mast (sailing)|maszt]], [[sloop|slup]], [[spinnaker|spinaker]], [[Shackle|szekla]], [[schooner|szkuner]]; 
* Food: cheeseburger, [[crisps|chipsy]], dressing, fast food, grill, hamburger, hot dog, lunch, popcorn, [[toast|tost]]

Take note, that some of the borrowed words already have Polish equivalents and therefore are not recognized by all language users:&lt;br /&gt;
''menadżer'' (manager) instead of ''kierownik''&lt;br /&gt;
''quad'' ([[quad bike]]) instead of ''czterokołowiec''&lt;br /&gt;
''monitoring'' ([[CCTV]]) instead of ''nadzór'', ''dozór''&lt;br /&gt;
''W czym mogę pomóc'' (English: How can I help you) instead of ''Czym mogę służyć'' (English: How can I serve you).

In addition to lexical borrowings, there is also a number of [[calque]]s in everyday use.

==Anglicisms in Italian==
Under [[Benito Mussolini]], efforts were made to purify [[Italian language|Italian]] of Anglicisms and other foreign words. Today, Italian is one of the most receptive languages for anglicisms.&lt;ref&gt;Universität Regensburg (26–28 September 2006) [http://www.uni-regensburg.de/Fakultaeten/phil_Fak_IV/Anglistik/aie/abstracts.doc "Anglicisms in Europe - Universität Regensburg"] ''Universität Regensburg''. Retrieved 30 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anglicisms in Spanish==
{{Main|Spanglish}}

The Hispanisation of English words is fairly common in the United States and even in Latin America. In Spain, the adoption of English words is extremely common in the spheres of business and information technology, although it is usually frowned upon by purists.

==Anglicisms in Finnish==
{{see also|Finglish|label 1=American Finglish}}

The Anglicisms can be divided to four types: direct phonetic imitation, lexical and grammatical [[calque]]s, and contamination of orthography. Official language (as given by the [[Language Planning Office]]) deprecates Anglicisms, and for the most part, native constructions are sufficient even in [[spoken Finnish|spoken language]]. Nevertheless, some Anglicisms creep in.

Computer jargon is generally full of direct imitation, e.g. ''svappi'' "swap". Other jargons with abundant Anglicisms are pop music, scifi, gaming, fashion, automobile and to some extent scientific jargon. This is regarded a sign of overspecialization, if used outside the context of the jargon. Generally, direct imitation is not as common, but there are examples. For example, the word ''sexy'' [seksy], pronounced with an Y unlike in English [seksi], might be used as an adjective. This is teenager-specific.

Lexical calques take an English expression, like ''[[killer application]]'', and produce ''tappajasovellus'', which does mean "an application that kills" just as in English. You will need to know the equivalent English term to understand this.

Some speakers, especially those in frequent contact with the English language have created a grammatical calque of the English ''you''-impersonal. The English impersonal utilizes the second person pronoun ''you'', e.g. ''You can't live if you don't eat''. Here, the word ''you'' does not refer explicitly to the listener, but signifies a general statement. The same example is rendered in Finnish as ''Syömättä ei elä'', where a separate grammatical impersonal (also known as ''passiivi'') is used. When translated word-by-word, ''Sä et elä jos sä et syö'', it will refer directly to the listener. Here the contraction ''sä'' of spoken language is used instead of the ''sinä'' of spoken language. Then, ''you'' will need to understand that it is an Anglicism, or ''you'' can be offended by the commanding "You there!" tone produced. (There are also native examples of the same construction, so the origin of this piece of grammar may not always be English.)

An English orthographical convention is that compound words are written separately, whereas in Finnish, compound words are written together, using a hyphen with acronyms and numbers. In Finnish, ''prosessitekniikka'' and ''Intel 80286 -prosessori'' would be correct, but ''process engineering'' or ''Intel 80286 processor'' would not. Failure to join the words or omitting the hyphen can be either an honest mistake, or contamination from English.

Another orthographical convention is that English words tend to be written as the originals. For example, the computer jargon term from ''to chat'' is written as ''chattailla'' (chat + [[frequentative]]), even if it is pronounced ''sättäillä''. The forms ''chattäillä'' or ''chättäillä'' are used, too. Sometimes, it is even standard language, e.g. ''sherry'' {{IPA-fi|ʃerry}}, instead of according to English pronunciation ''šeri'' {{IPA|[ʃeri]}}.

==Other definitions==

Other definitions of Anglicism include: a word or construction peculiar to English; a word or phrase that is peculiar to [[British English]]; or English syntax, grammar, or meaning transposed in another language resulting in incorrect language use or incorrect translation.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In the context of [[Interlingua]], an Anglicism is a uniquely English expression used when speaking or writing Interlingua. Many English expressions have penetrated into a [[Interlingua and eligibility of international words|wide variety of languages]], making them good Interlingua expressions. Novice speakers sometimes assume that an English expression is correct Interlingua when in fact it is not sufficiently international. For example, a novice may use ''Lassa nos considerar le optiones'' to mean 'Let's consider the options', as in English. In Interlingua, however, this expression means 'Permit us to consider the options'. A more international expression is ''Que nos considera le optiones'', literally 'That we consider the options'.

== Career  ==
Fernald specializes in children's [[language development]], investigating the development of speed and efficiency in children's early comprehension in relation to their emerging lexical and grammatical competence.  Recently, she has also begun to study language development in bilingual Spanish-English speaking children and children who are learning Spanish in addition to English. 
Her research has shown that infants prefer [[baby talk]] to adult speech and that it plays an important role in their language development,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Bizarre talk makes good tool|publisher=[[United Press International]]|date=October 1982|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=li8QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=T48DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5513,1659490&amp;dq=anne-fernald&amp;hl=en}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that baby talk has universal features that span multiple cultures and languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title='Parentese': Universal Language|journal=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 17, 1992|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-17/local/me-1742_1_universal-language|last=Maugh|first=Thomas H., II}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Fertile Minds|first=J.

== Selected Research ==

=== Socioeconomic Status Research ===
One of the studies Fernald focused on was the effect of Socioeconomic Status on language processing skills and vocabulary. Socioeconomic status in this study were based upon the education level of each parents, occupation of each parent, and income. She focused on children between the ages of eighteen months to twenty-four months. In the beginning of her study, she found that at the start the children did not seem to have a difference in skills and vocabulary, but at twenty-four months they had an approximate six month gap. Her research contributed to the debates during the Civil Rights Movement, when the question was raised of if there was truly inequalities in education between Black and White schools. In her research she found that socioeconomic status does affect the way that children develop language, these factors include: childcare and amount of time spent with the child. In Fernald’s research, she found that Socioeconomic status does matter, but the quantity and quality of interactions with children. Fernald’s research contributed to language acquisition and also helped illustrate that there are many factors that go into how a child develops their repertoire in vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/desc.12019 |pmid=23432833 |pmc=3582035 |title=SES differences in language processing skill and vocabulary are evident at 18 months |journal=Developmental Science |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=234–248 |year=2013 |last1=Fernald |first1=Anne |last2=Marchman |first2=Virginia A. |last3=Weisleder |first3=Adriana }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of Early Language Experience and Acquisition ===
Anne Fernald and Adriana Weisleder produced the current study to answer the question: “Is early experience with language linked to the development of efficiency in language processing, and if so, differences in processing efficiency mediate the well established relation between early language experience and later vocabulary knowledge?” To answer these questions, Weisleder and Fernald gathered 29 Spanish-learning infants who were all typically developing according to their parents. The families that participated consisted of low-income Latino families. Fernald made audio recordings of the infants throughout the child's typical days and their interaction with their parents. The parents of were also asked to keep a log of their children which contained recordings of their interactions as well. Regarding measures of expressive vocabulary, parents collected productive vocabulary scores. Language processing efficiency was measured by presenting infants with pairs of images while hearing sentences containing one of the words. The children were also tested on child-directed speech, which is a change in tone of voice when speaking to a child the. Fernald discovered that a variety of adult-speech was found to be accessible to children in the low-income families. A main point to be aware of includes the variation between low-income Spanish speaking families and child-directed speech and its predicted effects on vocabulary. Also, learned vocabulary occurred only when speech was directed at the infant rather than in an an adult conversation. These findings conclude that the efficiency of speech processing does facilitate child directed speech and its relation to vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0956797613488145 |pmid=24022649 |pmc=5510534 |title=Talking to Children Matters |journal=Psychological Science |volume=24 |issue=11 |pages=2143–2152 |year=2013 |last1=Weisleder |first1=Adriana |last2=Fernald |first2=Anne }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fernald also studied to see if the pitch and tone in adults voices when talking to infants makes a difference when it comes to intent of the communication. Several different tests were used to determine whether or not what she was researching had any validity to it at all. The tests started out by using 80 participants, 20 mothers and 20 fathers of children between 10-14 months old and then 20 female and 20 male college students that had no direct experience with infants or kids past the age of 5. Fernald's tests had 5 natural samples of infant and adult directed speech recorded from mothers of 12 month old kids in 5 standardized interactional contexts: Attention-bid, Approval, Prohibition, Comfort, and Game/telephone. They then got 25 infant directed and 25 adult directed vocalizations that were electronically filtered to eliminate linguistic content. They then had the 80 subjects listen to these content filtered speech acts and tried to identify the intent of the speaker by only using the “prosodic” information or the pitch and tone. The subjects were able to tell the intent of the infant directed speech way more frequently than that of adult directed speech. What this was able to show is that the pitch of infant directed speech is more informative than adult directed speech and this is beneficial for preverbal infants. Fernald was ultimately able to contribute more information on how the patterns of child directed speech are beneficial to children's understanding of speech intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1130938 |pmid=2612255 |jstor=1130938 |title=Intonation and Communicative Intent in Mothers' Speech to Infants: Is the Melody the Message? |journal=Child Development |volume=60 |issue=6 |pages=1497–510 |year=1989 |last1=Fernald |first1=Anne }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Fernald's studies analyze how infants perceive different emotions through television. One simulation included, infants observing actors on a tv express negative and positive emotions when playing with certain toys. This study answered the question of whether a 10-12 month old baby will emote the same reactions towards a toy as the actors seen on a televised series did and if it will dictate the same emotion towards a toy. Once the infants were done watching they were then presented with the same objects and had 30 seconds to encode and react. When the infant was presented with the toy that the actor had negative emotions towards, the infant associated the same toy with negative emotions as well and resulted in the infant disengaging. This same procedure was done again but with the toy that the actor reacted positively to and again the baby corresponded the positive emotions with the toy and reacted positively towards within the 30 seconds. This simulation proves Fernald’s question to be true. She found that infants are able to interpret and encode the same emotions that are displayed on a televised screen. This is just one of the many ways an infant picks up on social-referencing. Social referencing is the process in which a child relies on social cues in a certain context to relay the correct reaction. This method efficiently examines if and how an infant encodes certain emotions towards certain objects from a stranger on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00532 |title=The Infant as Onlooker: Learning from Emotional Reactions Observed in a Television Scenario |journal=Child Development |volume=74 |pages=221–237 |year=2003 |last1=Mumme |first1=Donna L. |last2=Fernald |first2=Anne }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Azhe''' (Chinese 阿哲 Azhe; Azhepo; autonym: ''{{IPA|a˨˩dʐɛ˨pʰo˨˩}}'') is one of the [[Loloish languages]] spoken by the [[Yi people]] of [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;Halina Wasilewska in ed. Nathan Hill ''Medieval Tibeto-Burman Languages IV''  2012 Page 449 "... the writing as the basis and which corresponds to the classification of the Yi languages, present day traditional Yi writing can be sub-divided into five main varieties (Huáng Jiànmíng 1993), i.e. the Nuosu, Nasu, Nisu, Sani and Azhe varieties."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;黄建明 Huáng Jiànmíng 彝族古籍文献概要 1993 Yizu guji wenxian gaiyao [Outline of classical literature of Yi nationality].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6835">Work on '''translation of the Bible''' into the [[Kazakh language]] began with the work of [[Charles Fraser (missionary)|Charles Fraser]] of the Scottish Missionary Society. Fraser's translation of Matthew was published in 1818 (this was based on H. Brunton's Karass translation, and modified for Kazakh), and the New Testament in 1820 by the Russian Bible Society. J. M. E. Gottwald, a professor at Kazan University, revised it, and this was published in 1880 by the British and Foreign Bible Society in Kazan, and it was republished in 1887, and 1910. [[George W. Hunter (missionary)|George W. Hunter]], of the [[China Inland Mission]] in Ürümqi, considered this translation to be "a good translation, into Astrahan-Turki",&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Hunter, ''Examples of Various Turki Dialects''. Tihwafu, Sinkiang, China: China Inland Mission, 1918&lt;/ref&gt; he does not seem to have considered it to be Kazakh. Darlow and Moule say that it was intended for Kyrgyz in the neighbourhood of Orenburg, and the language was sometimes called "Orenburg Tatar".&lt;ref&gt;T. H.  Darlow &amp; Horace Frederick Moule, ''Historical Catalogue of the Printed Editions of Holy Scripture in the Library of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rev. W. Nicholson of the Royal Asiatic Society in St Petersburg this translation was intended for "The Kirghese hordes—Great, Little, and Middle, as they are called—[who] occupy various regions in Southern Siberia, Central Asia, and west of the Caspian Sea."&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland]]; Volume 18, 1886, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; George A. King says Fraser's translation was into the language of the "Western Kirghiz or Kirghiz-Kazak, though they disown the name Kirghiz".&lt;ref&gt;George A. King ''In Our Tongues''; p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Macarius II]], the [[Diocese of Tomsk|Bishop of Tomsk]], translated Mark, published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in Tomsk in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;George A. King ''In Our Tongues''; p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; All four Gospels in one volume were published in Kazan by Pravoslavnoe Missionerskoe Obshchestvo in 1901. This may be related to the edition of Mark previously published in Kazan, or could be the same as I. Katerinski's translation, listed in ''Book of a Thousand Tongues'' as Kirghiz.

[[Mildred Cable]]'s biography of George Hunter just says "a Qazaq speaking Russian". This version is printed in a Cyrillic script, slightly different from what Qazaqs use today; this script has a lot of Russian/Greek words in it, and uses Russian/Greek names, instead of Qazaq/Islamic ones. The 1901 work was republished in 1972 by the [[Institute for Bible Translation]] in [[Stockholm, Sweden]]. 

[[George W. Hunter (missionary)|George W. Hunter]] of the China Inland Mission was aware of the Kazan 1901 translation, and after much prayer that he would be able to get a copy of it, a man approached him in the bazaar offering to exchange it (a book he could not read) for one that he could.&lt;ref&gt;Mildred Cable, ''George Hunter: Apostle of Turkestan''&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter revised these translations and transliterated them into Arabic. He also translated Genesis and Acts.

==Publication==
Acts, Mark, and a tentative edition of Matthew was published by the British and Foreign Bible Society/China Inland Mission in "Tihwafu" (Ürümqi) in 1917. A 2nd edition, (new ed. of the 1917 translation by G. W. Hunter) of Mark was published in Shanghai in 1918. A 2nd edition (new ed. of the 1917 translation by G. W. Hunter) of Acts was published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in Shanghai in 1919. All four Gospels were published again by the British and Foreign Bible Society in Shanghai in 1927, and again in 1928. The Shanghai BFBS also published Genesis in 1931. There may have also been other parts of the Bible translated by G. W. Hunter, but they are lost, as is record of them.

A modern translation of the entire Kazak Bible was published by Yeni Yaşam Yayınları in 2010 in Istanbul.

In 2011, Jehovah's Witnesses published ''Мәсіхшілердің грек жазбалары. Жаңа дүние аудармасы'' (''New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures'') in Kazakh;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/?contentLanguageFilter=kk_cyrl |title=Online Bible—Read, Listen or Download Free: PDF, EPUB, Audio |website=Jw.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the complete ''New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures'' in Kazakh was released in September 2014.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 2015 the Kazakh Bible Society published a new translation of the Bible in two variants: a study Bible and a plain text Bible.

==Life and career==

&lt;!-- is this a publisher's blurb? --&gt;Nöstlinger&lt;!--prefer birth name--&gt; was born in [[Vienna]], Austria, in 1936.
By her own admission, she was a wild and angry child. After finishing high school, she wanted to become an [[art]]ist, and studied [[graphic arts]] at the Academy of Applied Arts in Vienna. She worked as a graphic artist for a few years, before marrying a [[journalist]], Ernst Nöstlinger, with whom she had two daughters. Today she alternates between her home in Vienna and a country house in [[Lower Austria]].{{when |date=October 2012}} {{citation needed |date=October 2012}}

The majority of Nöstlinger's production is literature for [[children's literature|children]] and for young people, and she also writes for [[television]], [[radio]] and [[newspaper]]s. She centres on the needs of children in her work, with an [[anti-authoritarian]] bent. She does not shy away from tackling difficult subjects like [[racism]], [[discrimination]] and self-isolation.{{citation needed |date=October 2012}}

Her first book was ''Die feuerrote Friederike'', published in 1970, which she illustrated herself. The book was published in English in 1975 as ''Fiery Frederica''.

WorldCat reports that her work most widely held in participating libraries is ''Fly away home'' (''Maikäfer flieg'', 1973).&lt;ref name=worldcat&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
The biennial [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]] conferred by the [[International Board on Books for Young People]] is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children's books. Nöstlinger received the writing award in 1984.&lt;ref name=andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=ibby-nostlinger/&gt;

A '''digital pen''' or '''smart pen''' is an input device which captures the [[handwriting]] or brush strokes of a user and converts handwritten analog information created using "pen and paper" into digital data, enabling the data to be utilized in various applications. This type of pen is usually used in conjunction with a [[digital notebook]], although the data can also be used for different applications or simply as a graphic.

A digital pen is generally larger and has more features than an [[active pen]]. Digital pens typically contain internal electronics and have features such as touch sensitivity, input buttons, memory for storing handwriting data and transmission capabilities.&lt;ref name="Shelly"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Discovering Computers: Fundamentals |last=Shelly |first=Gary B. |author2=Misty E.

== Characteristics ==
[[File: Цифровая координатная ручка Атари в автономном использовании.JPG |thumb|Smart Pen writes on ordinary paper or other surface, like a regular pen]]
The input device captures the handwriting data, that, once digitized, can be [[uploaded]] to a [[computer]] and displayed on its [[Visual display unit|monitor]].

Some pens are equipped with a digital recording device that allows users to use them as intelligent Dictaphone. They can be used, for example for students to record the voice of the master while taking notes.

==Technology groups==

=== Accelerometer ===
: [[Accelerometer]]-based digital pens contain components that detect movement of the pen and contact with the writing surface.
[[File:Wacom_ctl480_inside.JPG|thumb|Interior view of a Wacom tablet]]

=== Active ===
: [[Active pen]]s, such as [[N-trig]]'s DuoSense Pen™, include electronic components whose signals are picked up by a mobile device's built-in digitizer and transmitted to its controller, providing data on pen location, pressure, button presses and other functionality.

=== Positional ===
: Position-based digital pens use a facility to detect the location of the tip during writing. Some models can be found on [[graphics tablet]]s made popular by [[Wacom (company)|Wacom]], and on [[tablet computers]] using Wacom's Penabled™ technology.

=== Camera ===
: Camera-based pens use special [[digital paper]] to detect where the stylus contacts the writing surface, such as those using [[Anoto]] technology or [[NeoLAB Convergence]] technology.

=== Trackball pen ===
: Trackball pens use a sensor that is located on the pen to detect the motion of the trackball.

'''Eastern Bolivian Guaraní''', known locally as '''Chawuncu''' or '''Chiriguano''' (pejorative), is a [[Guaraní languages|Guaraní language]] spoken in [[South America]]. In [[Bolivia]] 33,670 speakers were counted in the year 2000, in the south-central [[Parapeti River]] area and in the city of [[Tarija, Bolivia|Tarija]].&lt;ref name="ethnologue"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=gui Eastern Bolivian Guaraní at Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Argentina]], there were approximately 15,000 speakers, mostly in [[Jujuy Province|Jujuy]], but also in [[Salta Province]], and 304 counted in the [[Paraguay]]an [[Chaco Department|Chaco]].&lt;ref name="ethnologue"/&gt;

Avá (Chané, Tapieté) and Izoceño are dialects.

In Argentina it is known as '''Western Argentine Guaraní''', while in Paraguay it is locally known as '''Ñandeva'''. However, outside Paraguay and specifically in Brazil, '''Nhandeva''' refers to [[Chiripá Guaraní]].

Eastern Bolivian Guaraní is one of a number of "[[Guaraní dialects]]" sometimes considered distinct languages. Of these, Paraguayan Guaraní is by far the most important variety and it is often referred to simply as Guaraní.

[[File:Rennes - Palais du parlement de Bretagne, statue L'Éloquence plein pied.jpg|thumb|Statue of Eloquence at the Palais du parlement de Bretagne, Rennes]] 
'''''Eloquence''''' (from [[French language|French]] ''eloquence'' from [[Latin]] ''eloquentia'') is fluent, forcible, elegant or persuasive speaking. It is primarily the power of expressing strong [[emotion]]s in striking and appropriate language, thereby producing conviction or persuasion. The term is also used for writing in a fluent style.

The concept of eloquence dates to the ancient Greeks, [[Calliope]] (one of the nine daughters of [[Zeus]] and [[Mnemosyne]]) being the [[Muse]] of [[epic poetry]] and eloquence. The Greek god [[Hermes]] was patron of eloquence.
[[Cicero]] is considered as one of the most eloquent orators of Antiquity. Fr. [[Louis Bourdaloue]] is regarded as one of the founders of French eloquence.
[[File:George Cruikshank - Tristram Shandy, Plate I. The Effects of Trim's Eloquence.jpg|thumb|"The Effects of Trim's Eloquence". [[George Cruikshank]]'s illustration to [[Laurence Sterne]]'s ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'']]

Eloquence derives from the Latin roots: ''ē'' (a shortened form of the preposition ''ex''), meaning "out (of)", and ''loqui'', a [[deponent verb]] meaning "to speak". Thus, being eloquent is having the ability to project words fluidly out of the mouth and the ability to understand and command the language in such a way that one employs a graceful style coupled with the power of persuasion, or just being extremely graceful in the interpretation of communication. 
 
[[Petrarch]] (Fracesco Petrarca), in his study program of the classics and antiquity (Italian Renaissance) focused attention on language and communication. After mastering language, the goal was to reach a "level of eloquence", to be able to present gracefully, combine thought and reason in a powerful way, so as to persuade others to a point of view.  Petrarch encouraged students to imitate the ancient writers, from a language perspective, combining clear and correct speech with moral thought.  The [[Renaissance]] humanists focused on the correlation of speech and political principles as a powerful tool to present and persuade others to particular concepts.  At the core of presentations was the use of graceful style, clear concise grammar and usage, and over time the insertion of rational and emotional arguments.

In modern times, colloquial speech entered into presentation styles deemed eloquent.

Eloquence is both a natural talent and improved by knowledge of language, study of a specific subject to be addressed, philosophy, rationale and ability to form a persuasive set of tenets within a presentation.

"True eloquence," [[Oliver Goldsmith]] says, "Does not consist ... in saying great things in a [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] style, but in a simple style; for there is, properly speaking, no such thing as a sublime style, the sublimity lies only in the things; and when they are not so, the language may be turgid, affected, [[metaphor]]ical, but not affecting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldsmith |first=Oliver |date=1759 |title=Of Eloquence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eloquent politicians==
Politicians are often termed eloquent. [[Marcus Antonius]], c. 83–30 BCE, Roman politician and soldier gave one of the most memorable speeches in history, dramatized by [[William Shakespeare]] in the play [[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]; Shakespeare used Antonius's famous opening line "Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears".

Many famous political leaders, from [[Pericles]] to [[Winston Churchill]], and dictators such as [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]], rose to prominence in large part due to their eloquence.  In the [[Iranian Revolution]], [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] came to power in part through the eloquence of his speeches, smuggled into the country on audio cassettes while he was still in exile. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/iranian-revolution-1977-1979/|title=The Iranian Revolution (1977-1979)|author=Stephen Zunes|date=April 2009|publisher=ICNC}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In recent times, India's Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] can also be termed as eloquent.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}, 
[[ Julius Malema]] a South African politician can also be classified as an eloquent public speaker.

A '''fix-up''' (or '''fixup''') is a [[novel]] created from several [[short fiction]] stories that may or may not have been initially related or previously published. The stories may be edited for consistency, and sometimes new connecting material, such as a [[frame story]] or other interstitial narration, is written for the new work. The term was coined by the [[science fiction]] writer [[A. E. van Vogt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinberg|first1=Robert|title=A. E. van Vogt: The Weinberg Interview (1980)|url=http://www.icshi.net/sevagram/interviews/weinberg.php|website=Icshi.net|publisher=Isaac Walwyn|accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; who published several fix-ups of his own, including ''[[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]'',&lt;ref name="liptak20130805"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Liptak |first=Andrew |date=2013-08-05 |title=A.E. van Vogt and the Fix-Up Novel |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/e-van-vogt-and-fix-novel/ |magazine=Kirkus Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the practice (if not the term) exists outside of science fiction. The use of the term in science fiction criticism was popularised by the first (1979) edition of the ''[[Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'', edited by [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]], which credited Van Vogt with the creation of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nicholls | first = Peter |author2=John Clute| title = New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction | publisher = Orbit | location = London | year = 1999 | isbn = 1-85723-897-4 | page = 432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/fixup|title=Fixup page at Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (Third Edition)|website=Encyclopedia of Science Fiction}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The name comes from the modifications that the author needs to make in the original texts to make them fit together as though they were a novel. Foreshadowing of events from the later stories may be jammed into an early chapter of the fix-up, and character development may be interleaved throughout the book. Contradictions and inconsistencies between episodes are usually worked out.

Some fix-ups in their final form are more of a [[short story cycle]] or composite novel rather than a traditional novel with a single main plotline. Examples are [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'' and [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[I, Robot]]'', both of which read as a series of short stories which may share plot threads and characters but which still act as self-contained stories.&lt;ref name="luscher"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5WyidbsLaxQC&amp;lpg=PA370&amp;ots=mnc_goAXNW&amp;pg=PA370#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=A Companion to the American Novel |last=Luscher |first=Robert M. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2012 |isbn=9781405101196 |editor-last=Bendixen |editor-first=Alfred |editor-link=Alfred Bendixen |series=Blackwell Companions to Literature and Culture |volume=80 |page=370 |chapter=The American Short-Story Cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, van Vogt's ''[[The Weapon Shops of Isher]]'' is structured like a continuous novel although it incorporates material from three previous Van Vogt short stories.

Fix-ups became an accepted practice in the 1950s, when science fiction and [[fantasy]]—once published only in magazines—began appearing in book form. Large book publishers like [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] entered the market, greatly increasing demand for fiction. Authors created new manuscripts from old stories to sell to publishers. [[Algis Budrys]] in 1965 described fixups as a consequence of the lack of good supply during the "bad years for quality" of the mid-1950s, although citing ''The Martian Chronicles'' and [[Clifford D. Simak]]'s ''[[City (novel)|City]]'' as among exceptions.&lt;ref name="budrys196510"&gt;{{Cite magazine

"Orthography and Identity in Cameroon."]&lt;/ref&gt; Consonant and vowel letters are not to contain diacritics, though {{angle bracket|ẅ}} is a temporary exception. The alphabet is not used sufficiently for the one unique letter, for a [[bilabial trill]], to have been added to Unicode. 

[[Maurice Tadadjeu]] and [[Etienne Sadembouo]] were central to this effort.

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt; Like {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɓ}}}}, but with the top hook turned to the left.

Aspirated consonants are written ''ph, th, kh'' etc. Palatalized and labialized consonants are ''py, ty, ky'' and ''pw, tw, kw'' etc. Retroflex consonants are written either ''Cr'' or with a cedilla: ''tr, sr'' or ''ţ, ş'', etc. Prenasalized consonants are ''mb, nd, ŋg'' etc. Preglottalized consonants are'' 'b, 'd, 'm'' etc. Geminant consonants are written double. 

{|class="wikitable IPA" align=center
|+Cameroonian vowels
|-
! ||Front&lt;br&gt;unrounded||front/central&lt;br&gt;rounded||central/back&lt;br&gt;unrounded||back&lt;br&gt;rounded

|-
!Mid-high
|e||ø||ɤ||o

|}

Long vowels are written double. Nasal vowels may be written with a cedilla: ''a̧'' etc. or with a single following nasal consonant: ''aŋ'' etc. (presumably assimilating to any following consonant), in which case VN would be written with a double nasal: ''aŋŋ'' etc. Harmonic vowels are written with a sub-dot, as {{angle bracket|{{IPA|bibị}}}} for {{IPA|[bib-y]}}.

Tone is written as in the IPA, with the addition or a vertical mark for mid-low tone: {{angle bracket|{{IPA|á ā a̍ à, â ǎ}}}} etc. Where rising and falling tones only occur on long vowels, they are decomposed: {{angle bracket|{{IPA|áà, àá}}}} etc. The high tone mark is used for contrastive stress in languages that do not have tone.

'''Gnanananda''' (Nia-na-nan-da) was an Indian guru, referred to by followers as Swami Sri Gnanananda Giri. He is believed to have been born in the early part of 8th century.&lt;ref name="hindu.com1"/&gt; He was the Chief Disciple of the Sri Sivaratna Giri Swamigal and one of the leaders (Peetathipathis) of the [[Jyotir Math]], one of the four Maths established by Adi Sankara. This lineage of Peetathipathis is also called the 'Giri' Paramparai, as seen from the Peetathipathis' name which ends with 'Giri'. Gnanananda is a [[Yogi|Mahayogi]], [[Siddha|Siddha Purusha]], Himalayan sage and Indian philosopher. He believed in [[Advaita Vedanta]] because of his [[Parampara|lineage]].  He had a number of disciples including [[Vidyananda Giri|Vidyananda]], [[Triveni (poetry)|Triveni]] and [[Dasagiri]].  He gave sanyasa to [[Haridhos]]&lt;ref name="hindu.com1"&gt;Master of bhajana sampradaya/Online edition of India's National Newspaper/3 Sep 2004 – 6th lineage of the Peetam|http://www.hindu.com/fr/2004/09/03/stories/2004090302630500.htm -&lt;/ref&gt;  Giriof [[Adi Shankara]].&lt;ref name="Sadguru Gnanananda page 7"&gt;Sadguru Gnanananda, his life, personality, and teachings/T. M. P. Mahadevan – 1979 – page 7&lt;/ref&gt; He also made him chief disciple at Gnananda Tapovanam circa 1960s commanding him to spread nama sankirtana through the world. Swami had a number of accomplished disciples through his abnormally long tenure- Bramanamda who took samadhi at Puskar, Achutadasa of Polur. He loved obsurity. He changed identity to avoid being recognised .

==Birth and childhood==
Sources report his birth as early 19th century in the village Mangalapuri in North Kanara District of [[Karnataka]].&lt;ref name="hindu.com1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadguru Gnanananda page 6"&gt;Sadguru Gnanananda, his life, personality, and teachings/T. M. P. Mahadevan – 1979 – page 6&lt;/ref&gt; to an orthodox [[Brahmin]] couple, Venkoba Ganapati and SriMathi Sakku Bai.&lt;ref name="Sadguru Gnanananda page 6"/&gt; He was named ''Subramanyam'' at birth, and left his home at a very early age.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} His birthday is celebrated on the birth star of ''Kritika'' in January (the Tamil month of ''Thai'').{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Sanyasa==
Sivaratna Giri Swami accepted Subramanyam as his disciple and named him ''Pragnana Brahmachari''.&lt;ref&gt;Sadguru Gnanananda, his life, personality, and teachings/T. M. P. Mahadevan – 1979 – page 8&lt;/ref&gt; Sivaratna Giri initiated Gnanananda in the traditional manner into the ''Giri'' order of [[Jyotirmath|Jyotir Mutt]] and gave him the monastic name of ''Sri Gnanananda Giri''.&lt;ref&gt;Sadguru Gnanananda, his life, personality, and teachings/T. M. P. Mahadevan – 1979 – 363 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Sivaratna Gnanananda adorned the 6th [[Parampara|lineage]] of Peetam&lt;ref name="hindu.com1" /&gt; of [[Totakacharya|Jagadguru Totakacharya]] for some time. However he nominated one Ananda Giri in his place and retired to the height of the [[Himalayas]] for penance. Gnananda spent many years at the sacred spot of [[Gangotri]] and icy caves of the Himalayas in intense ''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]]''. He travelled extensively on foot, spanning the whole India and Tibet, Nepal, Burma, Sri Lanka and Malaya. He met many holy men over the course of his pilgrimage.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Teaching and establishment of ''ashrams''==
Gnanananda returned to India and established an [[ashram]] at Attayampatti in Salem and then at Siddhalingamadam near [[Villupuram]].&lt;ref name="Sadguru Gnanananda page 17"&gt;Sadguru Gnanananda, his life, personality, and teachings/T. M. P. Mahadevan – 1979 – page 17&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous ashram, named "Sri Gnanananda Tapovanam", is situated two miles away from [[Tirukkoyilur]]. Gnanananda built temples for the deities of [[Gnanaganesa]], [[Gnanaskandan]], [[Gananapurisa]], [[Gnanambika]], [[Mahalaksmi]], [[Gnana Venugopala]], [[Gnana Bhairavar]] and [[Gnana AnjaneyanShiva]] in [[Tapovanam]].&lt;ref name="Sadguru Gnanananda page 17"/&gt; Another ashram was constructed in [[Yercaud]], a hill station near Salem.&lt;ref&gt;Sadguru Gnanananda, his life, personality, and teachings/T. M. P. Mahadevan – 1979 – 89–90 pages&lt;/ref&gt; It was called "Pranavanilayam".  This was a retreat for contemplatives. Giri wanted to develop it as a centre for comparative religion. In contrast to [[Tapovanam]], no rituals were permitted in [[Yercaud]].  The central emphasis was on meditation and dhyana.

Giri taught a number of paths based on the aptitude of his disciples.  Therefore, some of disciples are conversant in the "path of knowledge" ([[jñāna]]-marga) while others are the "path of works" ([[karma]]-marga) and still others follow the "path of faith" ([[bhakti]]-marga).  His senior monastic disciple [[Vidyananda Giri]] was a profound scholar and linguist and brought out Tamil translations of Shankara's commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads.  He also made available Tamil versions of famous Advaitic texts like ''Sanatsujatiyam''. He trained followers in Advaitic Nidhidhyasana. Another of his lineage, [[Satyananda Giri|Satyananda]] was associated with [[Franklin Merrell-Wolff]] and taught his method of "introceptive knowledge".

Giri realised that the path of [[Vichara]] and [[Nidhidhyasana]] was confined to a few philosophically advanced aspirants.  For devotees at a lesser level, he advocated [[stuti]], [[japa]] and [[nama sankirtan]].
He was well versed in all the modes of [[Bhajana Sampradaya]] and he held that [[Hari Bhajana]] for ordinary devotees  was the easiest way to attain "[[Moksha]]".
He had chosen [[Haridas Giri]]&lt;ref name="hindu.com - Resonant voice of Haridas Giri"/&gt; propagated the importance of [[Namasankeetanam]].
&lt;ref name="hindu.com - Resonant voice of Haridas Giri"&gt;Hindu.com – Resonant voice of Haridas Giri/Online edition of India's National Newspaper/28 Jan 2005 -http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/fr/2005/01/28/stories/2005012802060300.htm -&lt;/ref&gt;

Gnanananda had initiated (given [[sanyasa]]) to Hari, the son of [[Nat Anna Rao]]. The boy later became known as "Swami [[Haridhos]] Giri" on being initiated in sanyasa. Haridhos carried his guru's (Gnianananda's) sandals ([[Paadhuka]]) with him to all the holy places he went to. He also visited many holy places with his Guru Paadhuka to propagate the importance of singing god's praises ("NamaSankeerthanam") as instructed by his guru. As part of spreading the cult of Namasankeerthanam, Giri established Mandalis and Samajams in various countries.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Samadhi==
Sadguru has indicated to his devotees that he will attain samadhi in a few days. Accordingly, Sadguru Sri Gnananadhagiri Swamigal went into permanent samadhi status on 7 January 1974 around 3:30 a.m. His devotees waited for three days in the hope that Swami will come out of his Samadhi status. After consulting Kanchi Mahaswaamigal and Poondi Mahan who confirmed that Sadguru Swami Gnanananda Giri Swamigal has attained "NIRVIKALPA SAMADHI"  his body was put  inside a pit  on 10 January 1974 around 6:30 pm and the present adhistanam was constructed.

{{Wiktionary}} 
'''Gracility''' is slenderness, the condition of being '''gracile''', which means slender.

It derives from the Latin adjective ''gracilis'' ([[Masculine (grammar)|masculine]] or [[Feminine (grammar)|feminine]]), or ''gracile'' ([[Grammatical gender|neuter]])&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Mason D., Jenkins, Thornton; “Latin for Today, Book 2”; Pub: Ginn and Co., Ltd. (1934) &lt;/ref&gt; which in either form means slender, and when transferred for example to discourse, takes the sense of "without ornament", "simple", or various similar [[connotation]]s.&lt;ref name="isbn0-02-522580-4"&gt;{{cite book |author=Simpson, D. G. |title=Cassell's Latin dictionary: Latin-English, English-Latin |publisher=Cassell |location=London |year=1977 |pages= |isbn=0-02-522580-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his famous "Glossary of Botanic Terms", B. D. Jackson speaks dismissively&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Benjamin Daydon; "A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent" 4th Ed. 1928; Pub: Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, W.C.2&lt;/ref&gt; of an entry in earlier dictionary of A. A. Crozier&lt;ref&gt;Crozier, Arthur Alger; “A Dictionary of Botanical Terms”, Pub.: Henry Holt &amp; Co  1893. &lt;/ref&gt; as follows: ''Gracilis (Lat.), slender. Crozier has the needless word "gracile"''. However, his objection would be hard to sustain in current usage; apart from the fact that "gracile" is a natural and convenient term, it is hardly a [[neologism]]; the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&lt;ref name=OED&gt;Little, William; Fowler H.W.; Coulson J.; Onions, C.T. (Ed.):  "Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principals". Pub.: Oxford at the Clarendon Press (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; gives the source date for that usage as 1623. 

In the same entry for ''Gracile'', the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary remarks: ''Recently misused (through association with '''grace''') for Gracefully slender.'' This misuse is unfortunate at least, because the terms ''gracile'' and ''grace'' are completely unrelated: the etymological root of ''grace'' is the Latin word ''gratia'' from ''gratus'', meaning pleasing&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; and nothing to do with slenderness or thinness.    

== In biology ==
In biology, the term is in common use, whether as English or Latin:
* The term ''gracile''&amp;mdash;and its opposite, [[Robustness (morphology)|''robust'']]&amp;mdash;occur in discussion of the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of various [[hominids]] for example.
* The ''[[gracile fasciculus]]'' is a particular bundle of axon fibres in the spinal cord 
* The [[gracile nucleus]] is a particular structure of [[neuron]]s in the [[medulla oblongata]] 
* "[[GRACILE syndrome]]", is associated with a [[BCS1L]] [[mutation]] 

In [[Biological classification|biological taxonomy]], '''''gracile''''' is the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] or [[Specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] for various species. Where the gender is appropriate, the form is '''''gracilis'''''. Examples include:
* ''[[Campylobacter]] gracilis, a species of bacterium implicated in foodborne disease
* ''[[Ctenochasma]] gracile'', a late [[Jurassic]] [[pterosaur]]
* ''[[Eriophorum gracile]]'', a species of [[sedge]], [[Cyperaceae]]
* ''[[Euglena gracilis]]'', a unicellular flagellate protist
* ''[[Hydrophis]] gracilis'', a species of sea snakes
* ''[[Melampodium]] gracile'', a flowering plant species
* ''[[Moeritherium]] gracile'', an [[Eocene]] [[mammal]] species 

The same root appears in the names of some genera and higher [[Taxon|taxa]]:
* ''[[Gracilaria]]''  is a genus of red algae in the order ''Gracilariales''
* ''[[Gracillaria]]'' is a genus of [[leaf miner]] moths in the [[Taxonomic rank|superfamily]] ''[[Gracillarioidea]]''

==See also==
* [[Buckling]], for the slenderness ratio in engineering
* [[Grace (disambiguation)]]
* [[Gracilis (disambiguation)]], a Latin adjective in several species names{{spaced ndash}} as remarked above, the meanings are the same as for gracile, except for their grammatical gender
* [[Robustness (morphology)]]

The usage of and education in Haitian Creole—which is not mutually intelligible with French—has been contentious since at least the 19th{{nbsp}}century: where some Haitians saw French as a legacy of colonialism, Creole was maligned by francophone elites as a miseducated or poor person’s French.&lt;ref name="Schieffelin1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeGraff2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeGraff |first=Michel |author-link=Michel DeGraff |title=Against Creole exceptionalism |journal=Language |volume=79 |date=2003 |pages=391–410 |issue=2 |url=http://web.mit.edu/~linguistics/people/faculty/degraff/degraff-lang-79-02.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150729042434/http://web.mit.edu/~linguistics/people/faculty/degraff/degraff-lang-79-02.pdf |archive-date=29 July 2015 |dead-url=no |doi=10.1353/lan.2003.0114 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the late 20th{{nbsp}}century, Haitian presidents spoke only French to their fellow citizens,&lt;!-- Jean-Claude Duvalier’s “firm as a monkey’s tail” speech by radio --&gt; and until the 2000s, all instruction at Haitian elementary schools was in French, a foreign language to most of the students.&lt;ref name="DeGraff2015"/&gt;

Haitian Creole contains elements from both the [[Romance languages|Romance]] group of [[Indo-European languages]] through its superstratum [[French language]], as well as [[Languages of Africa|African languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Glottolog|hait1244|Haitian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gurevich2004"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LhPxHG8cLowC&amp;pg=PA304 |title=Lenition and Contrast: The Functional Consequences of Certain Phonetically Conditioned Sound Changes |pages=301–304 |last=Gurevich |first=Naomi |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |chapter=Appendix A: Result Summary |location=New York |isbn=978-1-135-87648-7 |lccn=2004051429 |oclc=919306666 |ol=5731391W |quote=Name:&amp;nbsp;...

One theory estimates that Haitian Creole developed between 1680 and 1740.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/71007434|title=Creole genesis and the acquisition of grammar : the case of Haitian creole|last=Claire.|first=Lefebvre,|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=0521025389|edition=Digitally printed 1st pbk. version|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=53|oclc=71007434}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://webcat1.library.ubc.ca:80/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=8119102|title=Pidgins, Creoles and mixed languages: an introduction|last=Velupillai|first=Viveka|date=2015|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=|isbn=9789027252715|series=Creole language library|location=Amsterdam ; Philadelphia|pages=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 16th and 17th centuries, French and Spanish colonizers produced tobacco, cotton, and sugar on the island.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Throughout this period, the population was made up of roughly equal numbers of ''[[Engagé|engagés]]'' (employed whites), ''[[gens de couleur]]'' and slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singler|first=John Victor|date=1996|title=Theories of Creole Genesis, Sociohistorical Considerations, and the Evaluation of Evidence: The Case of Haitian Creole and the Relexification Hypothesis|url=https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/jpcl.11.2.02sin|journal=Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages|language=en|volume=11|issue=2|pages=185–230|doi=10.1075/jpcl.11.2.02sin|issn=0920-9034|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singler estimates the economy shifted into sugar production in 1690, just prior to the official formation of the French colony of Saint-Domingue in 1697.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The sugar crops required a much larger labor force which lead to an increase in slave importation. In the 18th century an estimated 800,000 West-African individuals were enslaved and brought to Saint-Domingue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As the slave population increased, interactions between French-speaking colonists and slaves decreased.  

Many African slaves in French ownership were from the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] territory and particularly from [[Kwa languages]] such as [[Gbe languages|Gbe]] and the [[Central Tano languages]] and [[Bantu languages]].&lt;ref name="Lefebvre2006"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_D91RqW-CFYC|title=Creole Genesis and the Acquisition of Grammar: The Case of Haitian Creole|last=Lefebvre|first=Claire|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-02538-6|lccn=2006280760|oclc=71007434|ol=7714204M}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53–57}} Singler suggests that the number of Bantu speakers decreased while the number of Kwa speakers increased, with Gbe being the most dominant group. The first fifty years of {{lang|fr|Saint‑Domingue|italic=no}}'s sugar boom coincided with the Gbe predominance in the [[French West Indies#French Caribbean|French Caribbean]]. During the time Singler places the evolution of the language, the Gbe population was 50% of the imported slave population.&lt;ref name="Lefebvre2006"/&gt;{{rp|53–57}}

In contrast to the African languages, a type of [[classical French]] (''{{lang|fr|français{{nbsp}}classique}}'') and {{lang|fr|[[langues d'oïl]]|italic=no}} ([[Norman language|Norman]], {{lang|fr|[[Poitevin dialect|Poitevin]]|italic=no}} and {{lang|fr|[[Saintongeais dialect|Saintongeais]]|italic=no}} dialects, [[Gallo language|Gallo]] and [[Picard language|Picard]]) were spoken during the 17th and 18th centuries in {{lang|fr|Saint‑Domingue|italic=no}}, as well as in [[New France]] and [[French West Africa]].&lt;ref name="Valdman2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lefebvre2004"&gt;{{cite book |title=Issues in the Study of Pidgin and Creole Languages |last=Lefebvre |first=Claire |pages=240–241 |date=2004 |chapter=The linguistic situation in Haiti at the time Haitian Creole was formed |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_wbzAPZ7ZrYC&amp;pg=PA240 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |series=Studies in language companion series |volume=70 |isbn=978-1-58811-516-4 |issn=0165-7763 |lccn=2004041134 |oclc=54365215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves who seldom could communicate with fellow slaves would try to learn French. With the constant importation of slaves, the language gradually became formalized and became a distinct tongue to French. The language was also picked up by the whites and became used by all those born in what is now Haiti.&lt;ref name="Valdman2002"/&gt;

===Difference between Haitian Creole and French===
Haitian Creole and French have similar pronunciations and share many lexical items. In fact, over 90% of the Haitian Creole vocabulary is of French origin.&lt;ref name="Lagarde2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lagarde |first=François |title=Français aux Etats-Unis (1990–2005): migration, langue, culture et économie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gXscYwsV2sAC&amp;pg=PA137 |date=2007 |publisher=[[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang International Academic Publishers]] |isbn=978-3-03911-293-7 |page=137 |language=fr |chapter=5.&amp;nbsp;Langues §{{nnbsp}}1.&amp;nbsp;Locaters §{{nnbsp}}1.2.&amp;nbsp;Immigrés |oclc=122935474 |lccn=2008271325 |series=Transversales |volume=20 |location=Bern, Switzerland |quote={{lang|fr|le français et le créole haïtien&amp;nbsp;... sont des langues différentes «non mutuellement intelligibles»}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many [[cognate]] terms actually have different meanings. For example, as Valdman mentions in ''Haitian Creole: Structure, Variation, Status, Origin'', the word for "frequent" in French is {{lang|fr|fréquent}}; however, its cognate in Haitian Creole {{lang|ht|frekan}} means 'insolent, rude, and impertinent' and usually refers to people.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite book |title=Haitian Creole : structure, variation, status, origin |last=Valdman |first=Albert |publisher=Equinox |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-84553-387-8 |location=Equinox |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the grammars of Haitian Creole and French are significantly different. For example, in Haitian Creole, verbs are not conjugated as they are in French.&lt;ref name="Valdman2002" /&gt;

Both Haitian Creole and French have also experienced [[semantic change]]; words that had a single meaning in the {{nowrap|17th century}} have changed or have been replaced in both languages.&lt;ref name="Valdman2002" /&gt; For example, ''"{{lang|ht|Ki jan ou rele?}}"'' ("What is your name?") corresponds to the French ''{{lang|fr|Comment vous appelez‑vous&amp;thinsp;?}}'' Although the average French speaker would not understand this phrase, every word in it is in fact of French origin: {{lang|fr|qui}} "what"; {{lang|fr|genre}} "manner"; {{lang|fr|vous}} "you", and {{lang|fr|héler}} "to call", but the verb {{lang|fr|héler}} has been replaced by {{lang|fr|appeler}} in modern French.&lt;ref name="Valdman2002" /&gt;

Lefebvre proposed the theory of relexification, arguing that the process of relexification (the replacement of the phonological representation of a substratum lexical item with the phonological representation of a superstratum lexical item, so that the Haitian creole lexical item looks like French, but works like the substratum language(s)) was central in the development of Haitian Creole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lefebvre|first=Claire|date=1997|title=Relexification in Creole Genesis: The Case of Demonstrative Terms in Haitian Creole|url=https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/jpcl.12.2.02lef|journal=Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=181–201|doi=10.1075/jpcl.12.2.02lef|issn=0920-9034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fon language]], a modern [[Gbe languages|Gbe language]] native to [[Benin]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Togo]] in [[West Africa]], is often used to compare grammatical structure between Haitian Creole and to [[relexification|relexify]] it with vocabulary from French:&lt;ref name="Lefebvre1986"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lefebvre |first=Claire |date=1986 |chapter=Relexification in Creole Genesis Revisited: the Case of Haitian Creole |editor-last1=Muysken |editor-first1=Pieter |editor-last2=Smith |editor-first2=Norval |title=Substrata Versus Universals in Creole Genesis |location=Amsterdam |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tAkYez_Kv7IC&amp;pg=PA279 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |isbn=978-90-272-5221-0 |pages=279–301 |lccn=86018856 |oclc=14002046 |ol=5268669W |series=Creole Language Library |volume=1 |issn=0920-9026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early development===
Haitian Creole developed in the 17th and 18th centuries on the western third of Hispaniola in a setting that mixed native speakers of various Niger–Congo languages with French colonizers.&lt;ref name="DeGraff2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=DeGraff |first=Michel |author-link=Michel DeGraff |title=Comparative Creole Syntax: Parallel Outlines of 18&amp;nbsp;Creole Grammars |url=http://web.mit.edu/~linguistics/people/faculty/degraff/degraff2007hc-ccs.pdf |date=2007 |publisher=Battlebridge |location=London |isbn=978-1-903292-01-3 |pages=101–102 |chapter=''Kreyòl Ayisyen'', or Haitian Creole ('Creole French') |editor-last1=Holm |editor-first1=John |editor-link1=John A.

American linguistic expert [[Frank Laubach]] and Irish Methodist missionary [[H.&amp;nbsp;Ormonde McConnell]] developed a standardized Haitian Creole orthography. Although some regarded the orthography highly, it was generally not well received.&lt;ref name="Fontaine1981"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Pierre-Michel |last=Fontaine |date=1981 |title=Language, Society, and Development: Dialectic of French and Creole Use in Haiti |journal=Latin American Perspectives |volume=8 |pages=28–46 |issue=1 |doi=10.1177/0094582X8100800103 |issn=0094-582X |jstor=2633128 |oclc=5724884282 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[orthography]] was standardized in 1979. That same year Haitian Creole was elevated in status by the Act of 18 September 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/amsudant/haiti-loi-1979.htm |title=Haïti: Loi du 18 septembre 1979 |website=Chaire pour le développement de la recherche sur la culture d'expression française en Amérique du Nord |publisher=[[Université Laval]] |location=Québec City |language=fr |trans-title=Haiti: Act of 18 September 1979 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150727195106/http://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/amsudant/haiti-loi-1979.htm |archive-date=27 July 2015 |dead-url=no |quote={{lang|fr|L'usage du créole, en tant que langue commune parlée par les 90&amp;thinsp;% de la population haïtienne, est permis dans les écoles comme instrument et objet d'enseignement.}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{lang|fr|Institut Pédagogique National}} established an official orthography for Creole, and slight modifications were made over the next two decades. For example, the {{nowrap|hyphen (-)}} is no longer used, nor is the apostrophe.&lt;ref name="Védrine2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Védrine |first=Emmanuel W. |date=2007 |orig-year=1st pub. 1994 |chapter=Òtograf ofisyèl la |chapter-url=http://potomitan.info/vedrine/koudey.pdf#page=131 |url=http://potomitan.info/vedrine/koudey.pdf |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407185537/http://potomitan.info/vedrine/koudey.pdf#page=131 |format=PDF |archive-date= 7 April 2015 |title=Yon koudèy sou pwoblèm lekòl Ayiti |trans-title=Official spelling |language=ht |edition=2nd |location=Boston |page=131 |isbn=978-0-938534-28-0 |lccn=94-65943 |oclc=37611103 |quote={{lang|ht|Nou suiv sa yo rele ‘òtograf ofisyèl’ la lan tout sa li mande.

===Becoming an official language===
The Constitution of 1987 upgraded Haitian Creole to a national language alongside French.&lt;ref name="Sonino1989"&gt;{{cite book |last=Valdman |first=Albert |editor-first=Elisabetta |editor-last=Zuanelli Sonino |title=Literacy in School and Society: Multidisciplinary Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mywBCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59 |date=1989 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-1-4899-0909-1 |page=59 |chapter=The Use of Creole as a School Medium and Decreolization in Haiti |doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-0909-1 |quote=In 1979, by a presidential decree, Haitian Creole was officially recognized as classroom medium and as school subject at the primary level.

===Literature development===
Even without government recognition, by the end of the 1800s, there were already literary texts written in Haitian Creole such as {{lang|fr|[[Oswald Durand]]|italic=no}}'s {{lang|fr|Choucoune|italic=yes}} and {{lang|fr|[[Georges Sylvain]]|italic=no}}'s {{lang|ht|Cric?{{nbsp}}Crac!|italic=no}}. {{lang|fr|[[Félix Morisseau-Leroy]]|italic=no}} was another influential author of Haitian Creole work. Since the 1980s, many educators, writers, and activists have written literature in Haitian Creole. In 2001, ''Open Gate: An Anthology of Haitian Creole Poetry'' was published. It was the first time a collection of Haitian Creole poetry was published in both Haitian Creole and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Open Gate: An Anthology of Haitian Creole Poetry |last=Laraque |first=Paul |publisher= |year=April 2001 |isbn=978-1-880684-75-7 |location= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 October 2004, the Haitian daily {{lang|fr|[[Le Matin (Haiti)|Le Matin]]|italic=yes}} first published an entire edition in Haitian Creole in observance of the country's newly instated "Creole Day".&lt;ref name="DeGraff2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeGraff |first=Michel |author-link=Michel DeGraff |url=http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/degraff/degraff2005fallacy_of_creole_exceptionalism.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421020826/http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/degraff/degraff2005fallacy_of_creole_exceptionalism.pdf |archive-date=21 April 2015 |dead-url=no |title=Linguists' most dangerous myth: The fallacy of Creole Exceptionalism |journal=Language in Society |volume=34 |issue=4 |date=2005 |issn=0047-4045 |doi=10.1017/S0047404505050207 |pages=533–591 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|556}}

==Sociolinguistics==

===Role in society===
Although both [[French language|French]] and Haitian Creole are official languages in [[Haiti]], French is often considered the high language and Haitian Creole as the low language in the [[Diglossia|diglossic relationship]] of these two languages in society.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; That is to say, for the minority of Haitian population that is bilingual, the use of these two languages largely depends on the social context: French is more used in public, especially in formal situation, whereas Haitian Creole is more used in a daily basis and is often heard in ordinary conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Férére |first=Gérard A. |date=March 1977 |title=Diglossia in Haiti: A Comparison with Paraguayan Bilingualism |jstor=40653330 |journal=Caribbean Quarterly |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=50–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a large population in Haiti that speaks only Haitian Creole, whether under formal or informal conditions:{{quote|French plays no role in the very formal situation of a Haitian peasant (more than 80% of the population make a living from agriculture) presiding at a family gathering after the death of a member, or at the worship of the family [[lwa]] or voodoo spirits, or contacting a Catholic priest for a church baptism, marriage, or solemn mass, or consulting a physician, nurse, or dentist, or going to a civil officer to declare a death or birth.|source=Yves Dejean&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dejean |first=Yves |date=1983 |title=Diglossia revisited: French and Creole in Haiti |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00437956.1983.11435744#page=2 |format=PDF |journal=Word |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=189–213 |doi=10.1080/00437956.1983.11435744 |oclc=5845895993 |issn=0043-7956 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|192}}}}

===Use in educational system===
In most schools, French is still the preferred language for teaching. Generally speaking, Haitian Creole is more used in public schools{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}, as that is where most children of ordinary families who often only speak Haitian Creole go to school.

Historically, the education system has been French-dominant. Except the children of elites, many had to drop out of school because learning French was very challenging to them and they had a hard time to follow up{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}. The Bernard Reform of 1978 tried to introduce Haitian Creole as the teaching language in the first four years of primary school; however, the reform overall was not very successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=World Education Encyclopedia: A Survey of Educational Systems Worldwide |date=2002 |publisher=Gale Group |isbn=978-0-02-865594-9 |location=Detroit, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the use of Haitian Creole has grown but in a very limited way. After the earthquake in 2010, basic education became free and more accessible to the monolingual masses{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}. The government is still trying to expand the use of Haitian Creole and improve the school system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2013/02/06/haitian-schools-expand-use-of-creole-language?offset=50 |title=Haitian schools expand use of Creole language |last=Daniel |first=Trenton |date=6 February 2013 |work=US News|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730114936/https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2013/02/06/haitian-schools-expand-use-of-creole-language?offset=50|archive-date=30 July 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hebblethwaite |first=Benjamin |date=2012 |title=French and underdevelopment, Haitian Creole and development |url=http://users.clas.ufl.edu/hebble/Hebblethwaite%202012%20JPCL.pdf |journal=Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages |volume=27:2 |issue=2 |pages=255–302 |doi=10.1075/jpcl.27.2.03heb |issn=0920-9034 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthography==
{{IPA notice}}

Haitian Creole has a [[phonemic orthography]] with highly regular spelling, except for proper nouns and foreign words. According to the official standardized orthography, Haitian Creole is composed of the following 32 symbols: {{angbr|a}}, {{angbr|an}}, {{angbr|b}}, {{angbr|ch}}, {{angbr|d}}, {{angbr|e}}, {{angbr|è}}, {{angbr|en}}, {{angbr|f}}, {{angbr|g}}, {{angbr|h}}, {{angbr|i}}, {{angbr|j}}, {{angbr|k}}, {{angbr|l}}, {{angbr|m}}, {{angbr|n}}, {{angbr|ng}}, {{angbr|o}}, {{angbr|ò}}, {{angbr|on}}, {{angbr|ou}}, {{angbr|oun}}, {{angbr|p}}, {{angbr|r}}, {{angbr|s}}, {{angbr|t}}, {{angbr|ui}}, {{angbr|v}}, {{angbr|w}}, {{angbr|y}}, and {{angbr|z}}.&lt;ref name="Faraclas2012"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Haitian Creole Language: History, Structure, Use, and Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4xbGzLuBvWwC |date=2012 |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lanham, Maryland |page=100 |chapter=II.&amp;nbsp;Structure and Use §{{nnbsp}}4.&amp;nbsp;Orthography |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4xbGzLuBvWwC&amp;pg=PA100 |first1=Nicholas |last1=Faraclas |first2=Arthur K. |last2=Spears |first3=Elizabeth |last3=Barrows |first4=Mayra Cortes |last4=Piñeiro |editor1-first=Arthur K. |editor1-last=Spears |editor2-first=Carole M.

* There are no silent letters in the Haitian Creole orthography.
* {{Anchor|à}}All sounds are always spelled the same, except when a vowel carries a [[grave accent]] {{nowrap|{{angbr|`}} before {{angbr|n}}}}, which makes it an oral vowel instead of a nasal vowel:
** {{nowrap|{{angbr|en}} for {{IPA|/ɛ̃/}}}} and {{nowrap|{{angbr|èn}} for {{IPA|/ɛn/}}}};
** {{nowrap|{{angbr|on}} for {{IPA|/ɔ̃/}}}} and {{nowrap|{{angbr|òn}} for {{IPA|/ɔn/}}}}; and
** {{nowrap|{{angbr|an}} for {{IPA|/ã/}}}} and {{nowrap|{{angbr|àn}} for {{IPA|/an/}}}}.
* When immediately followed by a vowel in a word, the digraphs denoting the nasal vowels ({{angbr|an}}, {{angbr|en}}, {{angbr|on}}, and sometimes {{angbr|oun}}) are pronounced as an oral vowel followed by {{IPA|/n/}}.
* There is some ambiguity in the pronunciation of the high vowels of the letters {{angbr|i}} and {{angbr|ou}} when followed in spelling by {{angbr|n}}.&lt;ref name="Cadely 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Le statut des voyelles nasales en Créole&amp;nbsp;haïtien |work=Lingua |date=2002 |pages=437–438 |last=Cadely |first=Jean‑Robert |author-link=Jean-Robert Cadely |language=fr |trans-title=''The Status of Nasal Vowels in Haitian&amp;nbsp;Creole'' |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |volume=112 |issue=6 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(01)00055-9 |issn=0024-3841 |subscription=yes |quote=L’absence d’opposition distinctive dans la distribution des voyelles hautes ainsi que le facteur combinatoire illustré ci-dessus amènent certains auteurs&amp;nbsp;... à considérer les voyelles nasales {{IPA|[ĩ]}}&amp;nbsp;et&amp;nbsp;{{IPA|[ũ]}} comme des variantes contextuelles de leurs correspondantes orales.

===Haitian orthography debate===
The first technical orthography for Haitian Creole was developed in 1940 by H.{{nbsp}}Ormonde McConnell. It was later revised with the help of Frank Laubach, resulting in the creation of what is known as the [[McConnell–Laubach orthography]].&lt;ref name="Schieffelin1994"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.linguisticsociety.org/elanguage/pragmatics/article/download/387/387-681-1-PB.pdf |title=The 'Real' Haitian Creole: Ideology, Metalinguistics, and Orthographic Choice |last1=Schieffelin |first1=Bambi B. |last2=Doucet |first2=Rachelle Charlier |date=September 1992 |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |publisher=Elsevier |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=427–443 |doi=10.1525/ae.1994.21.1.02a00090 |issn=0378-2166 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728140830/http://journals.linguisticsociety.org/elanguage/pragmatics/article/download/387/387-681-1-PB.pdf |archive-date=28 July 2015 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|434}}

The McConnell–Laubach orthography received substantial criticism from members of the Haitian elite. Haitian scholar Charles Pressoir critiqued the McConnell–Laubach orthography for its lack of codified [[front rounded vowel]]s, which are typically used only by francophone elites.&lt;ref name="Schieffelin1994"/&gt;{{rp|436}} Another criticism was of the broad use of the letters {{angbr|k}}, {{angbr|w}}, and {{angbr|y}}, which Pressoir argued looked "too American".&lt;ref name="Schieffelin1994"/&gt;{{rp|431–432}} This criticism of the "American look" of the orthography was shared by many educated Haitians, who also criticized its association with [[Protestantism]].&lt;ref name="Schieffelin1994"/&gt;{{rp|432}} The last of Pressoir's criticisms was that "the use of the circumflex to mark nasalized vowels" treated nasal sounds differently from the way they are represented in French, which he feared would inhibit the learning of French.&lt;ref name="Schieffelin1994"/&gt;{{rp|431}}

The creation of the orthography was essentially an articulation of the language ideologies of those involved and brought out political and social tensions between competing groups. A large portion of this tension lay in the ideology held by many that the French language is superior, which led to resentment of the language by some Haitians and an admiration for it from others.&lt;ref name="Schieffelin1994"/&gt;{{rp|435}} This orthographical controversy boiled down to an attempt to unify a conception of Haitian national identity. Where {{angbr|k}} and {{angbr|w}} seemed too Anglo-Saxon and American imperialistic, {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|ou}} were symbolic of French colonialism.&lt;ref name="Romaine2002"&gt;{{cite journal |url= |title=Signs of Identity, Signs of Discord: Glottal Goofs and the Green Grocer’s Glottal in Debates on Hawaiian Orthography |last=Romaine |first=Suzanne |author-link=Suzanne Romaine |date=2002 |journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=189–224 |doi=10.1525/jlin.2002.12.2.189 |issn=1055-1360 |jstor=43104013 |registration=yes |quote=For some opponents of the official orthography, {{angbr|k}} and {{angbr|w}} are tainted with the perceived stigma of being Anglo-Saxon and smack of American imperialism. The French symbols {{nowrap|{{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|ou}}}}, however, are allied with colonialism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|191}}

===French-based orthography===
When Haiti was still a colony of France, edicts by the French government were often written in a French-lexicon creole and read aloud to the slave population.&lt;ref name="Ayoun"/&gt; The first written text of Haitian Creole was composed in the French-lexicon in a poem called ''[[Lisette quitté la plaine]]'' in 1757 by [[Duvivier de la Mahautière]], a White Creole planter.&lt;ref name="Ayoun"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VVg6AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA230 |title=Studies in French Applied Linguistics |editor=Ayoun, Dalila |page=230 |year=2008 |isbn=978-90-272-8994-0 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UNgxtsjOIf4C&amp;pg=PT257 |title=Beyond the Slave Narrative: Politics, Sex, and Manuscripts in the Haitian Revolution |editor=Jenson, Deborah |page=257 |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-84631-760-6 |publisher=Liverpool University Press |accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Haitian Creole orthography was standardized in the late 20th century, spelling varied, but was based on subjecting spoken Haitian{{nbsp}}Creole to written French, a language whose spelling has not matched its pronunciation since at least the 16th{{nbsp}}century. Unlike the phonetic orthography, French orthography of Haitian{{nbsp}}Creole is not standardized and varies according to the writer; some use exact French spelling, others adjust the spelling of certain words to represent pronunciation of the cognate in Haitian{{nbsp}}Creole, removing the silent letters. For example:&lt;br /&gt;{{lang|ht|Li ale travay nan maten}} ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} "He goes to work in the morning") could be transcribed as:
* {{lang|ht|Li ale travay le maten}},
* {{lang|ht|Lui aller travail le matin}}, or
* {{lang|ht|Li aller travail le matin}}.

==Grammar==
Haitian Creole grammar is highly analytical: for example, verbs are not inflected for tense or person, and there is no [[grammatical gender]], which means that adjectives and articles are not inflected according to the noun. The primary word order is [[subject–verb–object]] as it is in French and English.

Many grammatical features, particularly the pluralization of nouns and indication of possession, are indicated by appending certain markers, like ''yo'', to the main word. There has been a debate going on for some years as to whether these markers are [[affix]]es or [[clitic]]s, and if punctuation such as the hyphen should be used to connect them to the word.&lt;ref name="Schieffelin1994"/&gt;{{rp|185–192}}

Although the language's vocabulary has many words related to their French-language cognates, its sentence structure is like that of the West African [[Fon language]].&lt;ref name="Lefebvre1986"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"

("my bike")

|-
|bekann mwen yo

|keke che le
("bike my plural")
|mes bécanes
("my bikes")
|my bikes
|}

===Pronouns===
There are six pronouns: first, second, and third person, each in both singular, and plural; all are of French etymological origin.&lt;ref name="SaintMartin2005"&gt;{{cite thesis |url=https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/saint-martin_weston_200508_ma.pdf#page=17 |title=Les formes des pronoms personnels de l’haïtien et leur place en comparaison avec celles du français |date=2005 |pages=9–11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427032723/http://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/saint-martin_weston_200508_ma.pdf#page=17 |archive-date=27 April 2016 |dead-url=no |first=Weston |last=Saint&amp;nbsp;Martin |language=fr |trans-title= |format=PDF |oclc=155834626 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no difference between direct and indirect objects.

===Plural of nouns===
Definite nouns are made plural when followed by the word {{lang|ht|yo}}; indefinite plural nouns are unmarked.

|{{lang|fr|les filles mettent des robes}}
|'''the''' girl&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt; put on dress&lt;u&gt;es&lt;/u&gt;
|}

===Possession===
Possession is indicated by placing the possessor or possessive pronoun after the item possessed. In northern Haiti, {{lang|ht|a}} or {{lang|ht|an}} is placed before the possessive pronoun.

Possession does not indicate definiteness ("my friend" as opposed to "a friend of mine"), and possessive constructions are often followed by a definite article.

===Indefinite article===
The language has two indefinite articles, ''on'' and ''yon'' (pronounced {{IPA|/õ/}} and {{IPA|/jõ/}}) which correspond to French ''un'' and ''une''. ''Yon'' is derived from the French {{nowrap|''il y a un''}} {{nowrap|("there is a")}}. Both are used only with singular nouns, and are placed before the noun:

The final syllable of the preceding word determines which is used with which nouns.&lt;ref name="Cadely2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cadely |first=Jean-Robert |title=Recent Development in Creole Studies |series=Linguistische Arbeiten |volume=472 |date=2003 |publisher=Max Niemeyer Verlag |location=Tübingen, Germany |page=20 |chapter=Nasality in Haitian Creole |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=reoiAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20 |editor-last=Adone |editor-first=Dany |doi=10.1515/9783110948318.5 |isbn=978-3-11-094831-8 |issn=0344-6727 |oclc=5131095031}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20}} If the last sound is an [[oral consonant]] and is preceded by an [[oral vowel]], it becomes ''la'':

===Demonstratives===
There is a single word ''sa'' that corresponds to English "this" and to "that" (and to French ''ce'', ''ceci'', ''cela'', and ''ça''). As in English, it may be used as a [[demonstrative]], except that it is placed '''after''' the noun that it qualifies. It is often followed by ''a'' or ''yo'' (in order to mark [[Grammatical number|number]]): ''sa a'' ("this here" or "that there"):

{| class="wikitable"

!Haitian Creole
!French
!English
|-
|rowspan="2" |jaden sa bèl

===Verbs===
Many verbs in Haitian Creole are the same spoken words as the French [[infinitive]], but there is no [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] in the language; the verbs have one form only, and changes in [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]], and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] are indicated by the use of [[#Tense markers|markers]]:

====Copula====
{{Main|Copula (linguistics)#Haitian Creole}}

The concept expressed in English by the [[copula (linguistics)|verb "to{{nbsp}}be"]] is expressed in Haitian Creole by three words, {{lang|ht|se}}, {{lang|ht|ye}}, and sometimes {{lang|ht|e}}.

The verb {{lang|ht|se}} (pronounced similarly to the English word "say") is used to link a subject with a [[Subject complement|predicate nominative]]:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!French
!English
|-
|{{lang|ht|li se frè mwen}}
|{{lang|fr|il est mon frère}}
|he is my brother
|-
|rowspan="2" |{{lang|ht|mwen se yon doktè}}
|{{lang|fr|je suis médecin}}
|rowspan="2" |I'm a doctor
|-
|{{lang|fr|je suis docteur}}
|-
|rowspan="2" |{{lang|ht|sa se yon pyebwa mango}}
|rowspan="2" |{{lang|fr|c'est un manguier}}
|this is a mango tree
|-
|that is a mango tree
|-
|{{lang|ht|nou se zanmi}}
|{{lang|fr|nous sommes amis}}
|we are friends
|}

The [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] {{lang|ht|sa}} or {{lang|ht|li}} can sometimes be omitted with {{lang|ht|se}}:{{clarify|date=September 2015}}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!French
!English
|-
|rowspan="2" |{{lang|ht|se yon bon ide}}
|rowspan="2" |{{lang|fr|c'est une bonne idée}}
|that's a good idea
|-
|this is a good idea
|-
|rowspan="2" |{{lang|ht|se nouvo chemiz mwen}}
|rowspan="2" |{{lang|fr|c'est ma nouvelle chemise}}
|that's my new shirt
|-
|this is my new shirt
|}

To express "I want to be", usually {{lang|ht|vin}} ("to{{nbsp}}become") is used instead of {{lang|ht|se}}.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!French
!colspan="2" |English
|-
|{{lang|ht|li pral vin bofrè m}}
|rowspan="2" |{{lang|fr|il va devenir mon beau-frère}}
|rowspan="2" |he will be my {{nowrap|brother-in-law}}
|rowspan="2" |he will be my stepbrother
|-
|{{lang|ht|li pral vin bofrè mwen}}
|-
|{{lang|ht|mwen vle vin on doktè}}
|{{lang|fr|je veux devenir docteur}}
|colspan="2" |I want to become a doctor
|-
|rowspan="2" |{{lang|ht|sa pral vin yon pye mango}}
|rowspan="2" |{{lang|fr|ça va devenir un manguier}}
|colspan="2" |that will become a mango tree
|-
|colspan="2" |this will become a mango tree
|-
|{{lang|ht|nou pral vin zanmi}}
|{{lang|fr|nous allons devenir amis}}
|colspan="2" |we will be friends
|}

{{lang|ht|Ye}} also means "to{{nbsp}}be", but is placed exclusively at the '''end''' of a sentence, after the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] and the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] (in that order):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!French
!English
|-
|{{lang|ht|mwen se Ayisyen}}
|rowspan="2" |{{lang|fr|je suis haïtien}}
|rowspan="2" |I am Haitian
|-
|{{lang|ht|Ayisyen mwen ye}}
|-
|{{lang|ht|Koman ou ye?}}
|''{{abbr|[[wikt:literally|lit.]]|literally}}'' {{lang|fr|Comment êtes-vous?}}
|How are you?
|}

Haitian Creole has [[stative verbs]], which means that the verb "to{{nbsp}}be" is [[Covert (linguistics)|not{{nbsp}}overt]] when followed by an [[adjective]]. Therefore, {{lang|ht|malad}} means both "sick" and "{{nowrap|to be sick}}":

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!French
!English
|-
|{{lang|ht|mwen gen yon sè ki malad}}
|{{lang|fr|j'ai une sœur malade}}
|I have a sick sister
|-
|{{lang|ht|sè mwen malad}}
|{{lang|fr|ma sœur est malade}}
|my sister is sick
|}

====To have====
The verb "to have" is ''genyen'', often shortened to ''gen''.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!French
!English
|-
|mwen gen lajan nan bank lan
|j'ai de l'argent dans la banque
|I have money in the bank
|}

====There is====
The verb ''genyen'' (or ''gen'') also means "there is" or "there are":

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!French
!English
|-
|gen anpil Ayisyen nan Florid
|il y a beaucoup d'Haïtiens en Floride
|there are many Haitians in Florida
|-
|rowspan="2" |gen on moun la
|rowspan="2" |il y a quelqu'un là
|there is someone here
|-
|there is someone there
|-
|rowspan="2" |pa gen moun la
|rowspan="2" |il n'y a personne là
|there is nobody here
|-
|there is nobody there
|}

====To know====
The Haitian Creole word for "to know" and "to know how" is {{lang|ht|konnen}}, which is often shortened to {{lang|ht|konn}}.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!French
!English
|-
|rowspan="2" |Eske ou konnen non li?
|rowspan="2" |Connais-tu son nom?
|Do you know his name?
|-
|Do you know her name?
|-
|rowspan="2" |mwen konnen kote li ye
|je sais où il est
|I know where he is
|-
|je sais où elle est
|I know where she is
|-
|Mwen konn fè manje
|Je sais comment faire à manger
|I know how to cook&lt;br/&gt;({{abbr|lit|literally}}. "I know how to make food")
|-
|Eske ou konn ale Ayiti?
|As-tu été à Haïti?
|Have you been to Haiti?&lt;br/&gt;({{abbr|lit|literally}}. "Do you know to go to Haiti?")
|-
|rowspan="2" |Li pa konn li franse
|Il ne sait pas lire le français
|He cannot read French&lt;br/&gt;({{abbr|lit|literally}}. "He doesn't know how to read French")
|-
|Elle ne sait pas lire le français
|She cannot read French&lt;br/&gt;({{abbr|lit|literally}}. "She doesn't know how to read French")
|}

====To do====
''Fè'' means "do" or "make". It has a broad range of meanings, as it is one of the most common verbs used in [[idiomatic phrase]]s.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!French
!English
|-
|Kòman ou fè pale kreyòl?
|Comment as-tu appris à parler Créole?
|How did you learn to speak Haitian Creole?
|-
|Marie konn fè mayi moulen.
|Marie sait faire de la farine de maïs.
|Marie knows how to make cornmeal.
|}

====To be able to====
The verb ''kapab'' (or shortened to ''ka'', ''kap'' or ''kab'') means "to be able to (do something)". It refers to both "capability" and "availability":

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!French
!English
|-
|mwen ka ale demen
|je peux aller demain
|I can go tomorrow
|-
|petèt mwen ka fè sa demen
|je peux peut-être faire ça demain
|maybe I can do that tomorrow
|-
|nou ka ale pita
|nous pouvons aller plus tard
|we can go later
|}

====Tense markers====
There is no [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] in Haitian Creole. In the present non-progressive tense, one just uses the basic verb form for [[stative verb]]s:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!French
!English
|-
|mwen pale kreyòl
|je parle créole
|I speak Creole
|}

When the basic form of [[action verb]]s is used without any verb [[marker (linguistics)|markers]], it is generally understood as referring to the past:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!French
!English
|-
|mwen manje
|j'ai mangé
|I ate
|-
|ou manje
|tu as mangé
|you ate
|-
|rowspan="2" |li manje
|il a mangé
|he ate
|-
|elle a mangé
|she ate
|-
|nou manje
|nous avons mangé
|we ate
|-
|rowspan="2" |yo manje
|ils ont mangé
|rowspan="2" |they ate
|-
|elles ont mangé
|}

''Manje'' means both "food" and "to eat", as ''manger'' does in [[Canadian French]]{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}; ''m ap manje bon manje'' means "I am eating good food".

For other [[Grammatical tense|tenses]], special "tense marker" words are placed before the verb. The basic ones are:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Tense marker
!Tense
!Annotations
|-
|te
|[[simple past]]
|from French ''été'' ("been")
|-
|t ap
|past [[progressive aspect|progressive]]
|a combination of ''te'' and ''ap'', "was doing"
|-
|ap
|[[present progressive]]
|with ''ap'' and ''a'', the [[pronoun]]s nearly always take the short form (''m ap'', ''l ap'', ''n ap'', ''y ap'', etc.). From 18th century French ''être après'', progressive form
|-
|a
|[[Future tense|future]]
|some limitations on use. From French ''avoir à'' ("to have to")
|-
|pral
|near or definite [[Future tense|future]]
|translates to "going to". Contraction of French ''pour aller'' ("going to")
|-
|ta
|conditional future
|a combination of ''te'' and ''a'' ("will do")
|}

[[Simple past]] or [[past perfect]]:

{| class="wikitable"

!Haitian Creole
!English
|-
|rowspan="2" |mwen te manje
|I ate
|-
|I had eaten
|-
|rowspan="2" |ou te manje

|he ate
|-
|she ate
|-
|he had eaten
|-
|she had eaten
|-
|rowspan="2" |nou te manje
|we ate
|-
|we had eaten
|-
|rowspan="2" |yo te manje
|they ate
|-
|they had eaten
|}

Past [[progressive aspect|progressive]]:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!English
|-
|mwen t ap manje
|I was eating

|-
|rowspan="2" |li t ap manje
|he was eating
|-
|she was eating
|-
|nou t ap manje

|-
|m ap manje

|rowspan="2" |l ap manje
|he is eating
|-
|she is eating
|-
|n ap manje
|we are eating
|-
|y ap manje
|they are eating
|}

For the [[present progressive]], it is customary, though not necessary, to add ''{{lang|ht|kounye{{nbsp}}a}}'' ("right{{nbsp}}now"):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!English
|-
|m ap manje kounye a
|I am eating right now
|-
|y ap manje kounye a
|they are eating right now
|}

Also, ''ap manje'' can mean "will eat" depending on the context of the sentence:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!English
|-
|rowspan="2" |m ap manje apre m priye
|I will eat after I pray
|-
|I am eating after I pray
|-
|rowspan="2" |mwen pap di sa
|I will not say that
|-
|I am not saying that
|}

Near or definite [[Future tense|future]]:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!English
|-
|mwen pral manje
|I am going to eat
|-
|ou pral manje
|you are going to eat
|-
|rowspan="2" |li pral manje
|he is going to eat
|-
|she is going to eat
|-
|nou pral manje
|we are going to eat
|-
|yo pral manje
|they are going to eat
|}

[[Future tense|Future]]:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!English
|-
|n a wè pita
|see you later&lt;br/&gt;({{abbr|lit|literally}}. "we will see later")
|}

Other examples:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!English
|-
|mwen te wè zanmi ou yè
|I saw your friend yesterday
|-
|nou te pale lontan
|we spoke for a long time
|-
|rowspan="2" |lè l te gen uit an...
|when he was eight years old...
|-
|when she was eight years old...
|-
|m a travay
|I will work
|-
|m pral travay
|I'm going to work
|-
|n a li l demen
|we'll read it tomorrow
|-
|nou pral li l demen
|we are going to read it tomorrow
|-
|mwen t ap mache epi m te wè yon chen
|I was walking and I saw a dog
|}

[[Recent past tense|Recent past]] markers include ''fèk'' and ''sòt'' (both mean "just" or "just now" and are often used together):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!English
|-
|mwen fèk sòt antre kay la
|I just entered the house
|}

A verb [[Grammatical mood|mood]] marker is ''ta'', corresponding to English "would" and equivalent to the French conditional tense:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!English
|-
|yo ta renmen jwe
|they would like to play
|-
|mwen ta vini si m te gen yon machin
|I would come if I had a car
|-
|rowspan="2" |li ta bliye w si ou pa t la
|he would forget you if you weren't here
|-
|she would forget you if you weren't here
|}

====Negation====
The word ''pa'' comes before a verb and any tense markers to negate it:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Haitian Creole
!English
|-
|Rose pa vle ale
|Rose doesn't want to go
|-
|Rose pa t vle ale
|Rose didn't want to go
|}

==Lexicon==
{{See also|Haitian Creole vocabulary|Wiktionary:Appendix:Haitian Creole Swadesh list}}

Most of the lexicon of Creole is derived from French, with significant changes in [[pronunciation]] and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]; often the French [[definite article]] was retained as part of the noun. For example, the French definite article ''la'' in ''la lune'' ("the moon") was incorporated into the Creole noun for moon: ''lalin''. However, the language also inherited many words of different origins, among them [[Wolof language|Wolof]], [[Fon language|Fon]], [[Kongo language|Kongo]], English, Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Taíno language|Taino]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Haitian Creole creates and borrows new words to describe new or old concepts and realities. Examples of this are ''fè bak'' which was borrowed from English and means "to move backwards" (the original word derived from French is ''rekile'' from ''reculer''), and also from English, ''napkin'', which is being used as well as ''tòchon'', from the French ''torchon''.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Nèg and blan===
Despite ''nèg'' and ''blan'' having similar words in French (''nègre'', a pejorative to refer to black people, and ''blanc'', meaning white, or white person), the meanings they carry in French do not apply in Haitian Creole. ''Nèg'' means "person", regardless of skin color (like "guy" or "dude" in American English).&lt;ref name="Katz2013"&gt;{{cite book |last=Katz |first=Jonathan M. |author-link=Jonathan M. Katz |title=The Big Truck That Went By: How the World Came to Save Haiti and Left Behind a Disaster |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cFKdtzGITDcC&amp;pg=PT77 |date=2013 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-1-137-32395-8 |pages=77–78 |lccn=2012037217 |oclc=886583605 |ol=16813109W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''blan'' generally means "foreigner" or "not from Haiti". Thus, a non-black Haitian man would be called ''nèg'', while a black person from the US could be referred to as ''blan''.&lt;ref name="Katz2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HaitiMarycare"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://haitimarycare.org/Newsletter_Spring_2013.pdf#page=2 |journal=Haiti Marycare News |title=Vignettes from Jakzi |date=2013 |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504203203/http://haitimarycare.org/Newsletter_Spring_2013.pdf#page=2 |archive-date=4 May 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Etymologically, the word ''nèg'' is derived from the French "nègre" and is cognate with the Spanish ''negro'' ("black", both the [[black|color]] and the [[Black people|people]]).&lt;!-- , and [[cognate]] with the English "negro". In Haitian Creole, however, ''nèg'' does not have pejorative connotations. --&gt;

There are many other Haitian Creole terms for specific tones of skin including ''grimo'', ''bren'', ''roz'', and ''mawon''. Some Haitians consider such labels as offensive because of their association with color discrimination and the Haitian class system, while others use the terms freely.

Haitian Creole is used widely among Haitians who have relocated to other countries, particularly the [[Haitian Americans|United States]] and [[Haitian Canadian|Canada]]. Some of the larger Creole-speaking populations are found in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] (where French is the first official language), [[New York City]], [[Boston]], and [[Central Florida|Central]] and [[South Florida metropolitan area|South Florida]] ([[Miami]], [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], and [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach]]). To reach out to the large Haitian population, government agencies have produced various public service announcements, school-parent communications, and other materials in Haitian Creole. For instance, [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]] in [[Florida]] sends out paper communications in Haitian Creole in addition to English and Spanish. In the Boston area, the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|Boston subway system]] and area hospitals and medical offices post announcements in Haitian Creole as well as English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn.mbta.com/uploadedfiles/Contact_Us/MC09021%20Title%20VI_Version1_Creo.pdf|title=enfòmaysyan sou tit iv - haitian creole|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; North America's only Creole-language television network is [[Haitian Broadcasting Network|HBN]], based in Miami.

It is recognized as a minority language in Cuba and a considerable number of Cubans speak it fluently. Most of these speakers have never been to Haiti and do not possess Haitian ancestry, but merely learned it in their communities. In addition, there is a Haitian Creole radio station operating in [[Havana]].&lt;ref name="AfroCubaWeb"/&gt;

===Dominican Republic===

==Software==
After the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], international aid workers desperately needed translation tools for communicating in Haitian Creole. Furthermore, international organizations had little idea whom to contact as translators. As an emergency measure, [[Carnegie Mellon University]] released data for its own research into the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Carnegie Mellon releases data on Haitian Creole to hasten development of translation tools |url=http://esciencenews.com/articles/2010/01/27/carnegie.mellon.releases.data.haitian.creole.hasten.development.translation.tools |website=e!&amp;nbsp;Science News |date=27 January 2010 |access-date=31 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702160548/http://esciencenews.com/articles/2010/01/27/carnegie.mellon.releases.data.haitian.creole.hasten.development.translation.tools |archive-date= 2 July 2013 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft Research]] and [[Google Translate]] implemented alpha version machine translators based on the Carnegie Mellon data.

Several smartphone apps have been released, including learning with flashcards by [[Before You Know It (software)|Byki]] and two medical dictionaries, one by [[Educa Vision]] and a second by [[Ultralingua]], the latter of which includes an audio phrase book and a section on cultural anthropology.

The '''Ika language''' is spoken by [[Ika people]] of Delta and Edo states of southern Nigeria. The Ika people are specifically located in the North-West of Delta State but some like Igbanke, Inyelen and Ekpon are presently located in Edo State. Ika communities mostly comprise the following: Agbor, Owa, Umunede, Mbiri, Abavo, Orogodo, Otolokpo, Igbodo, Ute-Okpu, Ute-Ugbeje, Idumuesah, Akumazi, Ekpon (Edo State), Igbanke (Edo State), Inyelen Edo State).

Other Ika communities found in Edo State are Owanikeke, Owa-Riuzo Idu and Igbogili. The Ika language has both elements of Edo and Igbo (with more Igbo influence). This is what makes the language unique. On Delta Radio there is now news in Ika. Ikas have commenced writing the Bible in their language, and right now the gospels of Mark, Luke, Matthew and John have been published in Ika along with other books. [[Ifeanyi Okowa]] is a prominent son of Ika background.

There are other Ika speaking communities who are presently in Edo state, namely; 
* Igbanke
* Ekpon
* Owa

The main varieties of the Iñupiaq language are Northern Alaskan Iñupiaq and [[Seward Peninsula]] Iñupiaq.

The Iñupiaq language has been in decline since contact with [[English language|English]] in the late 19th century. American colonization and the legacy of [[American Indian boarding schools|boarding schools]] have created a situation today where a small minority of Inupiat speak the Iñupiaq language. There is, however, revitalization work underway today in several communities.

== History ==
The Iñupiaq language is an [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Inuit-Yupik-Unangan language]], also known as Eskimo-Aleut, has been spoken in the northern regions of Alaska for as many as 5,000 years. Between 1,000 and 800 years ago, Inuit peoples migrated east from Alaska to Canada and [[Greenland]], eventually occupying the entire Arctic coast and much of the surrounding inland areas. The Iñupiaq dialects are the most conservative forms of the Inuit language, with less linguistic change than the other Inuit languages.

In the mid to late 19th century, Russian, British, and American colonizers would make contact with Inupiat people. In 1885, the American territorial government appointed [[Sheldon Jackson|Rev. Sheldon Jackson]] as General Agent of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/articles/s_haycox/sheldon_jackson.htm|title=Sheldon Jackson in Historical Perspective|website=www.alaskool.org|access-date=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his administration, Inupiat people (and all Alaska Natives) were educated in English-only environments, forbidding the use of Iñupiaq and other indigenous languages of Alaska. After decades of English-only education, with strict punishment if heard speaking Iñupiaq, after the 1970s, most Inupiat did not pass the Iñupiaq language onto their children, for fear of them being punished for speaking their language.

In 1972, the [[Alaska Legislature]] passed legislation mandating that if "a [school is attended] by at least 15 pupils whose primary language is other than English, [then the school] shall have at least one teacher who is fluent in the native language".&lt;ref&gt;Krauss, Michael E. 1974. Alaska Native language legislation. International Journal of American Linguistics 40(2).150-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] offers bachelor's degrees in Iñupiaq language and culture, while a preschool/kindergarten-level Iñupiaq immersion school named [[Nikaitchuat Ilisaġviat]] teaches grades PreK-1st grade in [[Kotzebue]].

In 2014, Iñupiaq became an official language of the State of Alaska, alongside English and nineteen other indigenous languages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Dialects==
There are four main dialect divisions and these can be organized within two larger dialect collections:&lt;ref name="languagegeek"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.languagegeek.com/inu/inupiaq.html |title=Iñupiaq/Inupiaq |accessdate=2007-09-28 |last= |first= |coauthors= |publisher=languagegeek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Iñupiaq Dialects.jpg|thumb|Iñupiaq dialect distribution through Alaska and Canada.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;]]

Seward Peninsula Iñupiaq is spoken on the [[Seward Peninsula]]. 
Northern Alaskan Iñupiaq is spoken from the [[Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska|Northwest Arctic]] and [[North Slope Borough, Alaska|North Slope]] regions of Alaska to the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie Delta]] in Northwest Territories, Canada.

'''&lt;big&gt;Extra Geographical Information:&lt;/big&gt;'''

'''Bering Strait Dialect:'''

The following generation of the population spoke [[Central Siberian Yupik language|Central Siberian Yupik]] or Russian.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The entire population of [[King Island (Alaska)|King Island]] moved to [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Bering Strait dialect might also be spoken in [[Teller, Alaska|Teller]] on the [[Seward Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Qawiaraq Dialect''':

'''Malimiutun Dialect''':

Both sub-dialects can be found in [[Buckland, Alaska|Buckland]], [[Koyuk, Alaska|Koyuk]], [[Shaktoolik, Alaska|Shaktoolik]], and [[Unalakleet, Alaska|Unalakleet]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A dialect of Malimiutun may be spoken in [[Deering, Alaska|Deering]], [[Kiana, Alaska|Kiana]], [[Noorvik, Alaska|Noorvik]], [[Shungnak, Alaska|Shungnak]], and [[Ambler, Alaska|Ambler]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Malimiutun sub-dialects have also been classified as "Southern Malimiut" (found in [[Koyuk, Alaska|Koyuk]], [[Shaktoolik, Alaska|Shaktoolik]], and [[Unalakleet, Alaska|Unalakleet]]) and "Northern Malimiut" found in "other villages".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''North Slope Dialect:'''

Common North Slope is "a mix of the various speech forms formerly used in the area".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Point Barrow Dialect was "spoken only by a few elders" in 2010.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A dialect of North Slope is also spoken in [[Kivalina, Alaska|Kivalina]], [[Point Lay, Alaska|Point Lay]], [[Wainwright, Alaska|Wainwright]], [[Atqasuk, Alaska|Atqasuk]], [[Utqiagvik, Alaska|Utqiagvik]], [[Nuiqsut, Alaska|Nuiqsut]], and [[Barter Island]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Phonology==
Iñupiaq dialects differ widely between consonants used. However, consonant clusters are always limited to exactly two consonants in a row. A word may not begin nor end with a consonant cluster.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

All Iñupiaq dialects have three basic vowels: ''a, i'', and ''u''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is unclear how these sounds are exactly pronounced and which, if any, allophones exist. All three vowels can be duplicated: ''aa'', ''ii'', ''uu''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is likewise unclear how these vowels are pronounced, though this most likely signifies that the vowels are pronounced longer. The following diphthongs can be found: ai, ia, au, ua, iu, ui.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A vowel cluster consists of exactly two vowels, no more than two vowels can appear together.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Bering strait dialect preserves the fourth proto-Eskimo vowel ''e'', pronounced /ə/ in proto-Eskimo .&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the other dialects, the proto-Eskimo ''e'' merged with the closed front vowel ''i''. The merged ''i'' is referred to as the strong ''i'', and causes palatalization when proceeding consonant clusters in the North Slope dialect (see section on palatalization below). The other ''i'' is referred to as the weak ''i''. The weak and strong ''i'' are not differentiated in orthography,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; therefore it is impossible to tell which ''i'' will cause palatalization "short of looking at other processes which depend on the distinction between two i's or else examining data from other Eskimo languages".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Phonological Issues In North Alaska Inupiaq|last=Kaplan|first=Lawrence|publisher=Alaska Native Language Center, University of Fairbanks|year=1981|isbn=0-933769-36-9|location=|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can be assumed that, within a word, if a palatal consonant is preceded by an ''i'', the ''i'' is strong. If an alveolar consonant is preceded by an ''i'', the ''i'' is weak.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A word may &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; begin with a stop (excluding palatal stops), s, y, m, n, or a vowel—with the exception of foreign loan words, proper names, and exclamations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This applies to both the Seward Peninsula dialects (using the Little Diomede Island sub-dialect as a representative example) and the North Slope dialects. The only exception is Uummarmiutun, which can have a word begin with an /h/. For example the word for "ear" in North Slope and Little Diomede Island dialects is "siun" whereas in Uummarmiutun it is "hiun".

A word may end in any nasal sound (except for the /ɴ/ found in North Slope), in the stops t, k, q, or in a vowel. In the North Slope dialect if a word ends with an m, and the next word begins with a stop, the m is pronounced /p/.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For Example: aġnam tupiŋa is read /aʁnap tupiŋa/ (IPA for vowels may be incorrect).

Very little information of the [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of Iñupiaq can be found. However, "fundamental frequency (Hz), intensity (dB), loudness (sones), and spectral tilt (phons - dB) may be important" in Malimiutun.&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt; Likewise, "duration is not likely to be important in Malimiut Iñupiaq stress/syllable prominence".&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt;

Please note, all ambiguities listed below exist because sources are inconsistent in reporting phonology. The phonological inventory was pieced together using multiple sources. Any discrepancies between the sources are marked as ambiguities. Ambiguities do not represent dialectal differentiation or different allophones.

The voiceless stops /p/ /t/ /k/ and /q/ are not aspirated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This may or may not be true for other dialects as well.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; The sound {{IPA|/ʎ̥/}} might actually be the sound {{IPA|/ɬʲ/}}. The sound {{IPAslink|ʔ}} might not exist. Recent learners of the language, and heritage speakers are replacing the sound {{IPA|/ʐ/}} (written in Iñupiaq as "r") with the American English /ɹ/ sound.&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt;

/c/ is derived from a palatalized and unreleased /t/.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Assimilation:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ====
Two consonants cannot appear together unless they share the manner of articulation (in this case treating the lateral and approximate consonants as fricatives). The only exception to this rule is having a voiced fricative consonant appear with a nasal consonant. Since all stops in North Slope are voiceless, a lot of needed assimilation arises from having to assimilate a voiceless stop to a voiced consonant.

This process is realized by assimilating the first consonant in the cluster to a consonant that: 1) has the same (or closest possible) area of articulation as the consonant being assimilated; and 2) has the same manner of articulation as the second consonant that it is assimilating to. If the second consonant is a lateral or approximate, the first consonant will assimilate to a lateral or approximate if possible. If not the first consonant will assimilate to a fricative. Therefore:
{| class="wikitable"
|+
!North Slope
!IPA
!English
|-
|Kami'''k + n'''iaq + te → kami'''gn'''iaqtuq
or   → kami'''ŋn'''iaqtuq
|/kn/ → /ɣn/
or   → /ŋn/
|"to put boots on" + "will" + "he" → he will put the boots on
|-
|iḷisa'''q + n'''iaq + tuq → iḷisa'''ġn'''iaqtuq
|/qn/ → /ʁn/
or   → /ɴ/ *
|"to study" + "will" + "he" → he will study
|-
|aqpa'''t + n'''iaq + tuq → aqpa'''nn'''iaqtuq
|/tn/  → /nn/
|"to run" + "will" + "he" → he will run
|-
|maki'''t + m'''an → maki'''nm'''an
|/tm/ → /nm/
|"to stand up" + "when he" → When he stood up
|-
|maki'''t + ł'''uni → maki'''łł'''uni
|/tɬ/   → /ɬɬ/
|"to stand" + "by ---ing" → standing up, he ... 
|}

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; The sound /ɴ/ is not represented in the orthography. Therefore the spelling '''ġn''' can be pronounced as /ʁn/ or /ɴn/. In both examples 1 and 2, since voiced fricatives can appear with nasal consonants, both consonant clusters are possible.kiiii&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The stops /t̚ &lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;/ and /t/ do not have a corresponding voiced fricative, therefore they will assimilate to the closest possible area of articulation. In this case, the /t̚ &lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;/ will assimilate to the voiced approximant /j/. The /t/ will assimilate into a {{IPA|/ʐ/}}. Therefore:
{| class="wikitable"
!North Slope
!IPA
!English
|-
|siksrii'''t + g'''uuq  → siksrii'''yg'''uuq
|/t̚ &lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;ɣ/ → /jɣ/
|"squirrels" + "it is said that" → it is said that squirrels
|-
|aqpa'''t + v'''ik → aqpa'''rv'''ik
|/tv/  → /ʐv/
|"to run" + "place" → race track
|}

In the case of the second consonant being a lateral, the lateral will again be treated as a fricative. Therefore:
{| class="wikitable"
!North Slope
!IPA
!English
|-
|aġna'''m + l'''u → aġna'''ml'''u
or → aġna'''vl'''u
|/ml/ → /ml/

or   → /vl/
|"(of) the woman" + "and" → and (of) the woman
|-
|aŋu'''n + l'''u → aŋu'''nl'''u

or → aŋu'''ll'''u
|/nl/  → /nl/

or    → /vl/
|"the man" + "and" → "and the man
|}
Since voiced fricatives can appear with nasal consonants, both consonant clusters are possible.

The sounds {{IPA|/f/}} {{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/χ/}} are not represented in the orthography (unless they occur alone between vowels). Therefore, like the /ɴn/ example shown above, assimilation still occurs while the spelling remains the same. Therefore:
{| class="wikitable"

|-

These general features of assimilation are not shared with Uummarmiut, Malimiutun, or the Seward Peninsula dialects. Malimiutun and the Seward Peninsula dialects "preserve[] voiceless stops (k, p, q, t) when they are etymological (i.e. when they belong to the original word-base)".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Compare:

==== Palatalization&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ====
The following patterns of palatalization can occur in North Slope Iñupiaq: /t/ → /t̚ &lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;/  {{IPA|/tʃ/}} or /s/;  {{IPA|/ɬ/}} → {{IPA|/ʎ̥/}}; {{IPA|/l/}} → {{IPA|/ʎ/}}; and /n/ → {{IPA|/ɲ/}}. Palatalization only occurs when one of these four alveolars is proceeded by a strong ''i''. Compare:
{| class="wikitable"
|+
!Type of I
!North Slope
!IPA
!English
|-
|strong
|qimm'''iq''' → qimm'''it'''
|/qimːiq/ → /qimːit̚ &lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;/
|dog → dogs
|-
|weak
|tum'''i''' → tum'''it'''
|/tumi/ → /tumit/
|footprint → footprints
|-
|strong
|iġġ'''i''' → iġġ'''iḷ'''u
|/iʁːi/ → /iʁːiʎu/
|mountain → and a mountain
|-
|weak
|tum'''i''' → tum'''il'''u
|/tumi/ → /tumilu/
|footprint → and a footprint
|}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Please note that the sound /it̚ &lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;/ does not have its own letter, and is simply spelled with a T t. The IPA transcription of the above vowels may be incorrect.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If a t that proceeds a vowel is palatalized, it will become an /s/. The strong ''i'' affects the entire consonant cluster, palatalizing all consonants that can be palatalized within the cluster. Therefore:
{| class="wikitable"
!Type of I
!North Slope
!IPA
!English
|-
|strong
|qimm'''iq + t'''igun → qimm'''is'''igun
|/qimmiq/ + /tiɣun/ → /qimːisiɣun/
|dog + amongst the plural things → amongst, in the midst of dogs
|-
|strong
|puq'''ik''' '''+''' '''t'''uq → puq'''iks'''uq
|/puqik/ + /tuq/ → /puqiksuq/
|to be smart + she/he/it → she/he/it is smart
|}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Note in the first example, due to the nature of the suffix, the /q/ is dropped. Like the first set of examples, the IPA transcriptions of above vowels may be incorrect.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If a strong ''i'' precedes geminate consonant, the entire elongated consonant becomes palatalized. For Example: niġ'''ḷḷ'''aturuq and tiki'''ññ'''iaqtuq.

==== Further strong versus weak ''i'' processes&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ====
The strong ''i'' can be paired with a vowel. The weak ''i'' on the other hand cannot.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The weak i will become an ''a'' if it is paired with another vowel, or if the consonant before the ''i'' becomes geminate. This rule may or may not apply to other dialects. Therefore:
{| class="wikitable"
!Type of I
!North Slope
!IPA
!English
|-
|weak
|tum'''i'''  → tum'''a'''a
|/tumi/ → /tumaː/
|footprint → her/his footprint
|-
|strong
|qimm'''i'''q → qimm'''i'''a
|/qimːiq/ → /qimːia/
|dog → her/his dog
|-
|weak
|kam'''i'''k → kamm'''a'''k
|/kamik/ → /kamːak/
|boot → two boots
|}
&lt;blockquote&gt;Like the first two sets of examples, the IPA transcriptions of above vowels may be incorrect.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Phonological Rules&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; ====
The /f/ is always found as a geminate.

The /j/ cannot be geminated, and is always found between vowels or proceeded by /v/. In rare cases it can be found at the beginning of a word.

The /h/ is never geminate, and can appear as the first letter of the word, between vowels, or preceded by /k/ /ɬ/ or /q/.

The {{IPA|/tʃ/}} and {{IPA|/dʒ/}} are always geminate or preceded by a /t/.

The {{IPA|/ʐ/}} can appear between vowels, preceded by consonants {{IPA|/ɣ/}} /k/ /q/ {{IPA|/ʁ/}} /t/ or /v/, or it can be followed by {{IPA|/ɣ/}}, /v/, {{IPA|/ʁ/}}.

Unlike the other Iñupiaq dialects, the Seward Peninsula dialect has a mid central vowel e (see the beginning of the phonology section for more information).

=== Gemination ===
In North Slope Iñupiaq, all consonants represented by orthography can be geminated, except for the sounds {{IPA|/tʃ/}} /s/ /h/ and {{IPA|/ʂ/}}.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Seward Peninsula Iñupiaq (using vocabulary from the Little Diomede Island as a representative sample) likewise can have all consonants represented by orthography appear as geminates, except for /b/ /h/ {{IPA|/ŋ/}} {{IPA|/ʂ/}} /w/ /z/ and {{IPA|/ʐ/}}. Gemination is caused by suffixes being added to a consonant, so that the consonant is found between two vowels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Writing systems==
{{see also|Iñupiaq Braille}}
Iñupiaq was first written when explorers first arrived in Alaska and began recording words in the native languages.  They wrote by adapting the letters of their own language to writing the sounds they were recording.  Spelling was often inconsistent, since the writers invented it as they wrote.  Unfamiliar sounds were often confused with other sounds, so that, for example, 'q' was often not distinguished from 'k' and long consonants or vowels were not distinguished from short ones.

Along with the Alaskan and Siberian [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]], the Inupiat eventually adopted the [[Latin script]] (''Qaliujaaqpait'') that [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries developed in [[Greenland]] and [[Labrador]]. Native Alaskans also developed a system of [[pictograph]]s,{{Which|date=February 2012}} which, however, died with its creators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/inuit/054303-e.html Project Naming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028155138/http://www.collectionscanada.ca/inuit/054303-e.html |date=2006-10-28 }}, the identification of Inuit portrayed in photographic collections at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Roy Ahmaogak, an Iñupiaq [[Presbyterian]] minister from [[Utqiagvik, Alaska|Utqiagvik]], worked with [[Eugene Nida]], a member of the [[SIL International|Summer Institute of Linguistics]], to develop the current Iñupiaq alphabet based on the Latin script.  Although some changes have been made since its origin—most notably the change from 'ḳ' to 'q'—the essential system was accurate and is still in use.

==Morphosyntax==
Due the number of dialects and complexity of Iñupiaq Morphosyntax, the following section will be discussing Malimiutun morphosyntax as a representative example. Any examples from other dialects will be marked as such.

Iñupiaq is a [[Polysynthetic|polysynthetic language]], meaning that words can be extremely long, consisting of one of three stems (verb stem, noun stem, and [[Demonstrative (linguistics)|demonstrative]] stem) along with one or more of three endings ([[postbase]]s, (grammatical) [[Ending (linguistics)|endings]], and [[enclitics]]).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The stem gives meaning to the word, whereas endings give information regarding case, mood, tense, person, plurality, etc. The stem can appear as simple (having no postbases) or complex (having one or more postbases). In Iñupiaq a "postbase serves somewhat the same functions that adverbs, adjectives, prefixes, and suffixes do in English" along with marking various types of tenses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There are six word classes in Malimiut Inñupiaq: nouns (see Nominal Morphology), verbs (see Verbal Morphology), adverbs, pronouns, conjunctions, and interjections. All [[demonstrative]]s are classified as either adverbs or pronouns.&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt;

=== Nominal Morphology ===
The Iñupiaq category of [[Grammatical number|number]] distinguishes [[Grammatical number|singular]], [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]], and [[plural]]. The language works on an [[Ergative–absolutive language|Ergative-Absolutive]] system, where nouns are inflected for number, several cases, and possession.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Iñupiaq (Malimiutun) has nine cases, two core cases (ergative and absolutive) and seven oblique cases (instrumental, allative, ablative, locative, perlative, similative and vocative).&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010"&gt;Lanz, Linda A. ''A Grammar of Iñupiaq Morphosyntax''. Houston, Texas: Rice University, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; North Slope Iñupiaq does not have the vocative case.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Iñupiaq does not have a category of [[Grammatical gender|gender]] and [[Article (grammar)|articles]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Iñupiaq Nouns can likewise be classified by Wolf A. Seiler's 7 noun classes.&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book |title= Iñupiatun Eskimo Dictionary |last=Seiler |first= Wolf A. |publisher= SIL International |year=2012 |isbn= |location= |pages= Appendix 7 |issn= 1939-0785 |url= http://www-01.sil.org/silepubs/Pubs/928474543482/Seiler_Inupiatun_Eskimo_Dictionary_LCDD_16.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These noun classes are "based on morphological behavior. [They] ... have no semantic basis but are useful for case formation ... stems of various classes interact with suffixes differently".&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt;

Due to the nature of the morphology, a single case can take on up to 12 endings (ignoring the fact that realization of these endings can change depending on noun class). For example, the possessed ergative ending for a class 1a noun can take on the endings: -ma, {{nbh}}mnuk, {{nbh}}pta, {{nbh}}vich, {{nbh}}ptik, -psi, -mi, -mik, -miŋ, -ŋan, -ŋaknik, and {{nbh}}ŋata. Therefore only general features will be described below. For an extensive list on case endings, please see [http://www-01.sil.org/silepubs/Pubs/928474543482/Seiler_Inupiatun_Eskimo_Dictionary_LCDD_16.pdf Seiler 2012, Appendix 4, 6, and 7].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Absolutive Case/ Noun Stems ====
The subject of an intransitive sentence or the object of a transitive sentence take on the [[absolutive case]]. This case is likewise used to mark the basic form of a noun. Therefore all the singular, dual, and plural absolutive forms serve as stems for the other oblique cases.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The following chart is verified of both Malimiutun and North Slope Iñupiaq.

!
!Endings
|-
|singular
| -q, -k, -n, or any vowel
|-
|dual
| -k
|-
|plural
| -t
|}
If the singular absolutive form ends with -n, it has the underlying form of -ti /tə/. This form will show in the absolutive dual and plural forms. Therefore: &lt;blockquote&gt;tiŋmisuu'''n''' (airplane) → tiŋmisuu'''ti'''k (two airplanes) and tiŋmisuu'''ti'''t (multiple airplanes)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Regarding nouns that have an underlying /ə/ (weak i), the ''i'' will change to an ''a'' and the previous consonant will be geminated in the dual form. Therefore:&lt;blockquote&gt;Ka'''mi'''k (boot) → ka'''mma'''k (two boots). &lt;/blockquote&gt;If the singular form of the noun ends with -k, the preceding vowel will be elongated. Therefore: &lt;blockquote&gt;sav'''ik''' (knife) → sav'''iik''' (two knives). &lt;/blockquote&gt;On occasion, the consonant preceding the final vowel is also geminated, though exact phonological reasoning is unclear.&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt;

==== Ergative Case ====
The [[ergative case]] is often referred to as the Relative Case in Iñupiaq sources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This case marks the subject of a transitive sentence or a genitive (possessive) noun phrase. For non-possessed noun phrases, the noun is marked only if it is a third person singular. The unmarked nouns leave ambiguity as to who/what is the subject and object. This can be resolved only through context.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt; Possessed noun phrases and noun phrases expressing genitive are marked in ergative for all persons.&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;*It is unclear as to whether this example is regular for the dual form or not.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Verbal Morphology&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt; ===
Again, Malimiutun Iñupiaq is used as a representative example in this section. The basic structure of the verb is [(verb) + (derivational suffix) + (inflectional suffix) + (enclitic)], although Lanz (2010) argues that this approach is insufficient since it "forces one to analyze ... optional ... suffixes".&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt; Every verb has an obligatory inflection for [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and [[Grammatical mood|mood]] (all marked by a single suffix), and can have other inflectional suffixes such as [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[Grammatical modality|modality]], and various suffixes carrying adverbial functions.

==== Tense&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt; ====
Tense marking is always optional. The only explicitly marked tense is the future tense. Past and present tense cannot be marked and are always implied. All verbs can be marked through adverbs to show relative time (using words such as "yesterday" or "tomorrow"). If neither of these markings is present, the verb can imply a past, present, or future tense.

|We (two) '''will''' talk on the phone.

|Future (implied)
|Iġñivaluktuq aakauraġa '''uvlaakun'''.
|[give birth probably] [my sister] '''[tomorrow]'''
|My sister (will) give(s) birth '''tomorrow'''. (the future tense "will" is implied by the word tomorrow)
|}

==== Aspect&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt; ====
Marking aspect is optional in Iñupiaq verbs. Both North Slope and Malimiut Iñupiaq have a [[Perfective aspect|perfective]] versus [[Imperfective aspect|imperfective]] distinction in aspect, along with other distinctions such as: [[frequentative]] (-ataq; "to repeatedly verb"), [[Habitual aspect|habitual]] (-suu; "to always, habitually verb"), [[Inchoative aspect|inchoative]] (-łhiñaaq; "about to verb"), and intentional (-saġuma; "intend to verb"). The aspect suffix can be found after the verb root and before or within the obligatory person-number-mood suffix.

==== Mood&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt; ====
Iñupiaq has the following moods: [[Indicative]], [[Interrogative mood|Interrogative]], [[Imperative mood|Imperative]] (positive, negative), Coordinative, and [[Conditional mood|Conditional]].&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Participles are sometimes classified as a mood.&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt;

=== Syntax ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nearly all syntactic operations in the Malimiut dialect of Iñiupiaq—and Inuit languages and dialects in general—are carried out via morphological means." &lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The language aligns to an [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative-absolutive]] case system, which is mainly shown through nominal case markings and verb agreement (see above).&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt;

The basic word order is subject-object-verb. However, word order is flexible and both subject and/or object can be omitted. There is a tendency for the subject of a transitive verb (marked by the ergative case) to precede the object of the clause (marked by the absolutive case). There is likewise a tendency for the subject of an intransitive verb (marked by the absolutive case) to precede the verb. The subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a clause (both marked by the absolutive case) are usually found right before the verb. However, "this is [all] merely a tendency." &lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt;

Iñupiaq grammar also includes morphological [[Passive voice|passive]], [[Antipassive voice|antipassive]], [[causative]] and [[applicative voice|applicative]].

==== Noun Incorporation&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt; ====
[[Incorporation (linguistics)|Noun incorporation]] is a common phenomenon in Malimiutun Iñupiaq. The first type of noun incorporation is ''lexical compounding''. Within this subset of noun incorporation, the noun, which represents an instrument, location, or patient in relation to the verb, is attached to the front of the verb stem, creating a new intransitive verb. The second type is ''manipulation of case''. It is argued whether this form of noun incorporation is present as noun incorporation in Iñupiaq, or "semantically transitive noun incorporation"—since with this kind of noun incorporation the verb remains transitive. The noun phrase subjects are incorporated not syntactically into the verb but rather as objects marked by the instrumental case. The third type of incorporation, ''manipulation of discourse structure''&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; is supported by Mithun (1984) and argued against by Lanz (2010). See Lanz's paper for further discussion.&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt; The final type of incorporation is ''classificatory noun incorporation'', whereby a "general [noun] is incorporated into the [verb], while a more specific [noun] narrows the scope".&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt; With this type of incorporation, the external noun can take on external modifiers and, like the other incorporations, the verb becomes intransitive. See ''Nominal Morphology'' (''Instrumental Case, Usage of Instrumental'' table, row four) on this page for an example.

==== Switch-References&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt; ====
[[Switch-reference]]s occur in dependent clauses only with third person subjects. The verb must be marked as reflexive if the third person subject of the dependent clause matches the subject of the main clause (more specifically matrix clause).&lt;ref name="Lanz, Linda A. 2010" /&gt; Compare:

==Text sample==
This is a sample of the Iñupiaq language of the Kivalina variety from ''Kivalina Reader,'' published in 1975.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Aaŋŋaayiña aniñiqsuq Qikiqtami. Aasii iñuguġuni. Tikiġaġmi Kivaliñiġmiḷu. Tuvaaqatiniguni Aivayuamik. Qulit atautchimik qitunġivḷutik. Itchaksrat iñuuvlutiŋ. Iḷaŋat Qitunġaisa taamna Qiñuġana.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is the English translation, from the same source:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Aaŋŋaayiña was born in Shishmaref. He grew up in Point Hope and Kivalina. He marries Aivayuaq. They had eleven children. Six of them are alive. One of the children is Qiñuġana.

'''Kamassian''' is an extinct [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic language]], included by convention in the Southern group together with [[Mator language|Mator]] and [[Selkup language|Selkup]] (although this does not constitute an actual subfamily). It had two dialects: Kamassian (also known as Kamas) and Koibal.  The last native speaker of the Kamassian dialect, [[Klavdiya Plotnikova]], died in 1989. Kamassian was spoken in [[Russia]], east of the [[Ural mountains]], by [[Kamasins]].

The term ''Koibal'' is also used as the [[ethnonym]] for the Kamas people who shifted to the Turkic [[Khakas language]]; the modern [[Koibal people]] are mixed Samoyed–[[Khakas people|Khakas]]–[[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian]].

'''Laghu''' (pronounced {{IPA-xx|laɡu|}}), also known as '''Hoatana''' or '''Katova''', is an extinct language of Santa Isabel in the [[Solomon Islands]]. Its last speaker died in 1984. People in the villages of Baolo and Samasodu, where it used to be spoken, now speak the neighboring [[Zabana language]], which is more widely spoken and still expanding (Palmer 2009:1-2).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6236">'''Language deprivation experiments''' have been attempted several times through history, isolating infants from the normal use of spoken or signed [[language]] in an attempt to discover the fundamental character of [[human nature]] or the [[origin of language]].

The [[United States|American]] literary scholar [[Roger Shattuck]] called this kind of research study "The Forbidden Experiment" because of the exceptional deprivation of ordinary human contact it requires.&lt;ref name="forbidden"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shattuck |first=Roger |url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1568360487&amp;id=9COPTtX16IIC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=TKQrin2p4P&amp;dq=%22forbidden+experiment%22&amp;sig=FFI91sIU9yzIyP8yvBxO-1xATgU |title=The Forbidden Experiment: The Story of the Wild Boy of Aveyron |origyear=1980 |year=1994|publisher=Kodansha International |isbn=1-56836-048-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not designed to study language, similar experiments on non-human primates (labelled the "[[Pit of despair]]") utilising complete social deprivation resulted in [[psychosis]].

==In history==
Ancient records suggest that this kind of experiment was carried out from time to time. An early record of an experiment of this kind can be found in [[Herodotus]]'s ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]''. According to Herodotus, the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[pharaoh]] [[Psamtik I]] carried out such an experiment, and concluded the [[Phrygia]]n race must antedate the Egyptians since the child had first spoken something similar to the Phrygian word ''bekos'', meaning "bread".&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''History'' II:2, found in "[[s:An Account of Egypt|An Account of Egypt]]".&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is likely that this was a willful interpretation of their babbling.&lt;ref&gt;Danesi, Marcel and Paul Perron (1999). Analyzing Cultures: An Introduction and Handbook. Indiana: Indiana University Press, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCulloch, Gretchen (2014). Slate Magazine. [http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/07/16/children_not_exposed_to_language_nicaraguan_sign_language_wild_children.html/ "What Happens if a Child Is Never Exposed to Language?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

An experiment allegedly carried out by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II]] in the 13th century saw young infants [[feral child|raised without human interaction]] in an attempt to determine if there was a [[natural language]] that they might demonstrate once their voices matured. It is claimed he was seeking to discover what language would have been imparted unto [[Adam and Eve]] by God.

The experiments were recorded by the monk [[Salimbene di Adam]] in his ''Chronicles'', who wrote that Frederick encouraged "foster-mothers and nurses to suckle and bathe and wash the children, but in no ways to prattle or speak with them; for he would have learnt whether they would speak the [[Hebrew language]] (which he took to have been the first), or [[Greek language|Greek]], or [[Latin]], or [[Arabic language|Arabic]], or perchance the tongue of their parents of whom they had been born. But he laboured in vain, for the children could not live without clappings of the hands, and gestures, and gladness of countenance, and blandishments."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/salimbene1.html Medieval Sourcebook: Salimbene: On Frederick II, 13th Century]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several centuries after Frederick II's experiment, [[James IV of Scotland]] was said to have sent two children to be raised by a [[Muteness|mute]] woman isolated on the island of [[Inchkeith]], to determine if language was learned or innate.&lt;ref name= "fla"&gt;{{cite web |title =First Language Acquisition |publisher =[[Western Washington University]] |url = http://pandora.cii.wwu.edu/vajda/ling201/test4materials/ChildLangAcquisition.htm |accessdate = 2007-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The children were reported to have spoken good Hebrew, but historians were skeptical of these claims soon after they were made.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Graham Dalyell|Dalyell, John Graham]], ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=1yYwAAAAYAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The Chronicles of Scotland by Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie'', vol. 1, Edinburgh (1814)] pp. 249-250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davidson|first1=J.P.|title=Planet word|date=2011|publisher=Michael Joseph|location=London|isbn=9780141968933|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OqfUJI3a5q4C&amp;pg=PT53|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This experiment was later repeated by the [[Mughal emperor]] [[Akbar]], who held that speech arose from hearing, thus children raised without hearing human speech would become mute.&lt;ref&gt;M. Miles, [http://www.sign-lang.uni-hamburg.de/bibweb/Miles/1200-1750.html ''SIGN, GESTURE &amp; DEAFNESS IN SOUTH ASIAN &amp; SOUTH-WEST ASIAN HISTORIES: a bibliography with annotation and excerpts from India; also from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Burma/Myanmar, Iraq, Nepal, Pakistan, Persia/Iran, &amp; Sri Lanka'', c1200-1750] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222020147/http://www.sign-lang.uni-hamburg.de/bibweb/Miles/1200-1750.html |date=2008-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
*The "forbidden experiment" occurs in [[Paul Auster]]'s ''[[The New York Trilogy]]''.
*In ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[Mute (The Twilight Zone)|Mute]]" ([[1963 in television|1963]]), several children are raised in such a manner to foster telepathic communication.
*In the ''[[Batgirl]]'' comic series, the title character, [[Cassandra Cain]], is deprived of spoken language during childhood. This was part of an attempt to create a [[martial artist]] with an exceptional ability to interpret [[body language]], as it was believed that this would give one a great advantage in [[close combat]].
*In ''[[Le Miroir de Cassandre]]'' by [[Bernard Werber]], the title character Cassandre and her older brother are deprived of spoken language during a part of their childhood as an experiment from their mother, a famous paedopsychologist

[[File:Minibar.jpeg|(214 × 172 pixels, file size: 7 KB, MIME type: image/jpeg)px|thumbnail|right|A refrigerated minibar]]

A '''minibar''' is a small refrigerator, typically an [[absorption refrigerator]], in a luxury hotel room or cruise ship stateroom. The hotel staff fill it with drinks and snacks for the guest to purchase during their stay. It is stocked with a precise inventory of goods, with a price list. The guest is charged for goods consumed when checking out of the hotel. Some newer minibars use infrared or other automated methods of recording purchases. These detect the removal of an item, and charge the guest's credit card right away, even if the item is not consumed. This is done to prevent loss of product, theft and lost revenue.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brantasinternational.com/Portals/388/NHEM_Creating_a_Refreshment_Profit_Center.pdf|title=Creating a Refreshment Profit Center|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525232151/http://www.brantasinternational.com/Portals/388/NHEM_Creating_a_Refreshment_Profit_Center.pdf|archivedate=2010-05-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus it is generally recommended for guests and their kids not to touch items in the minibar to avoid unwanted charges.&lt;ref name="stuff.co.nz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/news/98284950/why-minibars-are-disappearing-from-hotel-rooms.html|title=Why mini-bars are disappearing from hotel rooms|website=Stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minibar is commonly stocked with small bottles of [[alcoholic beverage]]s, [[juice]], [[bottled water]], and [[soft drinks]]. There may also be [[candy]], [[cookie]]s, [[Cracker (food)|crackers]], and other small snacks. Prices are generally very high compared to similar items purchased from a store, because the guest is paying for the convenience of immediate access and also the upkeep of the bar. Prices vary, but it is not uncommon for one can of non-alcoholic beverage to cost 6–10 [[USD]]. Due to the convenience of [[room service]] and the minibar, prices charged to the patron are much higher than the hotel's restaurant or [[tuck shop]].&lt;ref name="stuff.co.nz"/&gt; As premium bottled water has become popular with guests since the 2000s, there is "ambient placement" of such chargeable products outside the minibar and in the guests' line of vision; for example "by placing [bottled] water on bedside tables, during the night, people are more likely to grab it than get up to get a glass of water".&lt;ref name="stuff.co.nz1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/destinations/nz/13502/Avoid-a-maxi-bill-keep-away-from-the-mini-bar|title=Avoid a maxi bill, keep away from the mini bar|website=Stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's first minibar was introduced at the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel by manager Robert Arnold in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hk-magazine.com/city-living/column/ask-mr-know-it-all-what-history-hotel-minibar/.|title=Ask Mr. Know-It-All: What is the history of the hotel minibar?|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150518094615/http://hk-magazine.com/city-living/column/ask-mr-know-it-all-what-history-hotel-minibar/|archivedate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the months following its introduction in-room drink sales skyrocketed 500%, and the Hong Kong Hilton's overall annual revenue was boosted by 5%. The following year the Hilton group rolled out the minibar concept across all its hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://priceonomics.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-hotel-mini-bar/|title=The Rise and Fall of the Hotel Mini-Bar|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, as minibars become less and less popular with guests, hotels have been eliminating this feature from their rooms. It takes staff considerable time to re-stock the traditional mini-bar inventory and monitor its use precisely, and such manual work is prone to human error. In recent years cunning guests have managed to game the traditional minibar system, such as "drink the contents of the miniature Scotch bottle and replace them with weak tea. Water will do fine for the vodka. The Toblerone? Slit open the box with care and you can put it back empty" (known as "shrinkage"&lt;ref name="stuff.co.nz1"/&gt; as this fools both hotel staff and the next set of hotel guests), consume some minibar items before immediately lodging a noise/odor complaint to switch hotel rooms, and disputing the minibar charges at check-out time.&lt;ref name="stuff.co.nz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traveller.com.au/dont-pay-for-the-minibar-hotel-insiders-secrets-revealed-2inhc|title=Don't pay for the minibar: hotel insider's secrets revealed|date=22 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some newer minibars use infrared or other automated methods of recording purchases, detecting the removal of an item and automatically charge the guest's credit card right away, even if the item is not consumed.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== From absorption cooling unit to compressor ==

Typically the minibar cooling unit was different from standard refrigerators, using [[absorption refrigerator|absorption technology]]. An Italian company was the first manufacturer to install a compressor mini-refrigerator in the [[NASA]] Space Shuttle in 1982. A compressor refrigeration unit, in addition to a timer
and a eutectic plate, allow saving more energy, compared to a traditional absorption minibar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indelb.com/products/hotel/k40_ecosmart|title=Compressor minibars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18352">A '''mobile signature''' is a [[digital signature]] generated either on a mobile phone or on a [[SIM card]] on a mobile phone.

==Origins of the term==

===mSign===
The term first appeared in articles introducing [[mSign]] (short for Mobile Electronic Signature Consortium).  It was founded in 1999 and comprised 35 member companies. In October 2000, the consortium published an XML-interface defining a protocol allowing service providers to obtain a mobile (digital) signature from a mobile phone subscriber.

In 2001, [[mSign]] gained industry-wide coverage when it came apparent that Brokat (one of the founding companies) also obtained a process patent in Germany for using the mobile phone to generate digital signatures.

===ETSI-MSS standardization===
The term was then used by Paul Gibson (G&amp;D) and Romary Dupuis ([[France Telecom]]) in their standardisation work at the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI) and published in ETSI Technical Report TR 102 203.

The ETSI-MSS specifications define a [[SOAP]] interface and mobile signature roaming for systems implementing mobile signature services. ETSI TS 102 204, and ETSI TS 102 207.

==Today==
The mobile signature can have the legal equivalent of your own wet signature, hence the term "Mobile Ink", commercial term coined by Swiss [http://www.sicap.com/ Sicap]. Other terms include "Mobile ID" by [http://www.valimo.com/ Valimo Wireless], "Mobile Certificate" by a circle of trust of 3 Finnish mobile network operators implementing a roaming mobile signature framework Mobiilivarmenne, etc.

According to the EU directives for [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0093:EN:NOT electronic signatures]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0093:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 31999L0093 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; the mobile signature can have the same level of protection as the handwritten signature if all components in the signature creation chain are appropriately certified. The governing standard for the mobile signature creation devices and equivalent of a handwritten signature is described in the Commission Decision 2003/511/EC of 14 July 2003 on the publication of reference numbers of generally recognised standards for electronic signature products in accordance with the [[Electronic Signatures Directive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003D0511:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 32003D0511 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the signature solution is [[Common Criteria]] evaluated by an independent party and given the EAL4+ designation, the solution can produce what the EU directive and consequent clarifications are calling a [[qualified electronic signature]]. The current standard dates back to the year 2002/2003 and is in the process being renewed and published by the end of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/docs/standardisation/CEN_grant/cen_2010_31.pdf|title=Trust Services and Electronic identification (eID)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most, if not all, mobile signature implementations to date generate what the EU Directive is calling [[advanced electronic signature]].

The most successful mobile signature solutions can be found in [[Turkey]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.valimo.com/news_and_events/15-10-2008/valimo-boosts-mobile-signature-usage-turkey&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lithuania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elektroninis.lt|title=Elektroninis.lt|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estonia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-estonia.com/components/mobile-id|title=Mobile-ID — e-Estonia|website=e-estonia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Finland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobiilivarmenne.fi/en/|title=ENG - Mobiilivarmenne|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suomi.fi/suomifi/tyohuone/ajankohtaista/uutisarkisto/vetuma-palveluun_tulossa_mobiilitunnistautuminen/index.html|title=Suomi.fi|website=www.suomi.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; with millions of users.

Technically the mobile signature is created by a security module when a request for it reaches the device ([[SIM card]]) and after introducing the request to the user with a few explanation prompts, the device asks for a secret code that only the correct user should know. Usually, this is in form of a [[Personal identification number|PIN]]. If the access control secret was entered correctly, the device is approved with access to secret data containing for example [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] [[private key]], which is then used to do the signature or other operations that the request wanted.

The [[public key infrastructure|PKI]] system associates the public key counterpart of the secret key held at the secure device with a set of attributes contained in a structure called [[digital certificate]]. The choice of the registration procedure details during the definition of the attributes included in this digital certificate can be used to produce different levels of identity assurance. Anything from anonymous but specific to high-standard real-word identity. By doing a signature, the secure device owner can claim that identity.

Thus, the mobile signature is a unique feature for:
* Proving your real-world identity to third parties without face-to-face communications
* Making a legally-binding commitment by sending a confirmed message to another party
* Solve security problems of the online world with identity confirmation (an anonymous but specific identity is often equally good as a high-standards identity)

=== Public services ===

==== Estonian Mobile-ID ====
See [http://e-estonia.com/components/mobile-id].

==== Mobile Ink (Finland) ====
[http://www.sicap.com/solutions/mink/mink Mobile Ink]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sicap.com/solutions/mink/mink|title=Mobile Ink|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; unites high security and user-friendly access to digital services which require strong authentication and authorization. Subscribers can get mobile signature access to m-banking or corporate applications for example. Mobile Ink is a commercial term associated with the mobile signature solution of [http://www.sicap.com/ Sicap] building on Kiuru MSSP platform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kiuru MSSP products|url=http://www.methics.fi/products/kiuru-mssp/|publisher=Methics Oy}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [http://www.methics.fi/ Methics Oy].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.methics.fi/ Methics Oy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sicap and Methics Partner|url=http://www.sicap.com/news/sicap-and-methics-partner|publisher=Sicap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The platform allows simultaneous existence of multiple keys and associated identities with distinct registration procedures.
This is used for example as a replacement for RSA SecureID dongles with anonymous but specific identity in corporate access applications.

==== Mobiilivarmenne (Finland) ====
Mobile Certificate i.e. Mobiilivarmenne&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News in English|url=http://www.mobiilivarmenne.fi/en/bulletin/|accessdate=30 June 2013|publisher=Mobiilivarmenne portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Finnish is a term used in the Finnish market space to describe the roaming mobile signature solution deployed by the three mobile network operators [[Elisa (company)|Elisa]], [[Sonera]], and [[DNA]].

This setup was developed in all three operators co-operation under national Telecom technology coordination group FiCom, and it is world's first system where a fully functional co-operating ETSI TS 102 207 roaming service mesh was established in multi-vendor software environment. Another national feature is that mobile phone numbers are portable across the operators, and thus the phone number prefix does not identify the operator. To make things easy for the Application Providers (see ETSI TS 102 204), they can purchase service from any one of the Acquiring Entity service providers (mobile network operators), and reach all users.

Part of the background was update of national laws allowing digital Person Identity Certificates (for Mobiilivarmenne use) to be issued also by other parties than official registration authorities via Police offices. Another part was co-operation agreement between the operators on the form of the certificates, and certification procedures and practices producing similar certificate contents with similar identity issuance traceability. All of these were reviewed and approved by the Finnish Communication Regulatory Authority which tasks include the oversight of the identity registration services also at government registries.

The MSSP software vendors in the service mesh are [http://www.methics.fi/ Methics Oy], and [http://www.valimo.com/ Valimo Wireless]. Both Finnish companies.

==== Mobile ID in Ukraine ====
In Ukraine, [[Mobile ID]] project started in 2015, and later declared as one of [[Government of Ukraine]] priorities supported by EU. At the beginning of 2018 Ukrainian cell operators are evaluating proposals and testing platforms from different local and foreign developers. Platform selection will be followed up by comprehensive certification process.

==== Handy-Signatur in Austria ====
[[Austria]] started mobile signature by 2003, as a technology of ''[[Bürgerkarte]]'' (which includes electronic signing with SmartCards). It was provided bei [[mobilkom Austria]], but ended in 2007. After a relaunch in 2009, named ''Handy-Signatur'', it is well used, by 2014 over 300.000 people, 5% of the adult inhabitants, own a registered mobile signature. It is controlled by Austrian Government, National Bank and Graz University of Technology. It is based on a [[Transaction authentication number|TAN]] sent bei [[SMS]] on request and confirmed with a private PIN.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.buergerkarte.at/anwendungen-handy.html Das kann die Handy-Signatur]'', www.buergerkarte.at; ''[http://www.digitales.oesterreich.gv.at/site/cob__28545/5244/default.aspx Die Bürgerkarte]'', digitales.oesterreich.gv.at&lt;/ref&gt; According to 1999/93/EG signing by Handy-Signature is completely equivalent to a handwritten autograph.

=== Technology providers ===

==== Mobile ID ====
[[Valimo Wireless]], a [[Gemalto]] company, was the first company in the world to introduce mobile signature solutions into the market and creating the term Mobile ID. The initial mobile signature solution in Turkey by Turkcell used Valimo technology to implement  [http://www.valimo.com/news_and_events/15-10-2008/valimo-boosts-mobile-signature-usage-turkey the very successful mobile signature solution].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valimo.com/news_and_events/15-10-2008/valimo-boosts-mobile-signature-usage-turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gemalto.com/php/pr_view.php?id=164|title=Turkcell Selects Gemalto for World’s Largest Mobile Signature Rollout|website=www.gemalto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently Valimo Mobile ID is in use in several countries.

==== Kiuru MSSP ====
[[Methics Oy]] is a privately held [[Finland|Finnish]] technology company with strong expertise on PKI and MSSP services. The Kiuru MSSP product line is used directly and as OEM product by several service and solution providers.

==== ID HUB – Mobile ID ====
[https://idev-hub.com/en/news/systema-mobile-id-rozrobky-id-hub-pershoyu-v-ukrayini-projshla-derzhavnu-ekspertyzu/ Mobile ID platform] by Innovation Development HUB LLC is the only electronic identification and mobile signature solution, having already passed State certification in Ukraine. Uses both post-Soviet and European cryptography algorithms, which makes the platform suitable for CIS and EU PKI.

==== G&amp;D SmartTrust ====
[[G&amp;D SmartTrust]] is the original supplier of [[SIM card]] embedded [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] browsers with encryption plugins developed in late 1990es, it is called WIB (Wireless Internet Browser.)[http://www.smarttrust.com/developers-corner1] The WIB technology is licensed by the SmartTrust to many SIM card manufacturers, and the mobile network operators can choose to use cards with WIB capabilities in their normal user base immediately enabling them for use of the MSSP services.
SmartTrust's MSSP offering is called SmartLicentio.

=== Security issues ===
Authentication may still be vulnerable to man in the middle attacks and trojan horses, depending on the scheme employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schneier.com/essay-083.html|title=Essays: Two-Factor Authentication: Too Little, Too Late - Schneier on Security|website=www.schneier.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schemes like one-time-password-generators and [[two-factor authentication]] does not completely solve man in the middle attacks on an open network like the Internet. However, supporting the authentication on the Internet with a parallel closed network like mobile/GSM and a digital signature enabled SIM card is the most secure method today against the man in the middle attack. If application provider provides a detailed explanation of the transaction to be signed both on its Internet site and signing request to mobile operator, the attack can easily be recognized by the individual by comparing both screens. Since mobile operators do not let applications to send signing request for free, normally the cost and technicality of intrusion between the application provider and the mobile operator makes it an improbable attack target. Very least there are trace evidences in multiple places for the attack to have happened.

==With on-board key generation==
When a mobile user creates their sPIN (signing PIN) and secret key online within the secure [[SIM card]] during the registration process, this is known as "on-board key generation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Support of SmartTrust OBKG function at Kiuru MSSP|url=http://www.methics.fi/company/news/news-archive/#20090601|publisher=Methics Oy}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires a bit more interaction on user's behalf while registering, but on the other hand it makes the security mode interaction process familiar and lets them practice service usage. Also when the user forgets/locks the PIN associated with generated key, it is simple to generate a new key and assign it a new sPIN destroying the previous versions using same process as with original registration, and most importantly: without need for replacement of the SIM card. In these systems there is commonly no secondary signing PIN unblocking code (sPUK) at all, because revelation of such a code has identical requirements for the requesting person's identity verification as was with original person's identity registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key and PIN Life Cycle at Alauda WPKI Applet|url=http://www.methics.fi/products/wpki-products/alauda-wpki-client/#key-and-pin-lifecycle|publisher=Methics Oy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compare this with older "factory generated keys" model for older technology SIM cards that had insufficient processing power to do on-board key generation. The SIM card factory ran key-generation with special hardware accelerator and stored the key material on card along with initial sPIN and sPUK codes. Sometimes actual generation happened within the SIM card that was running in special manufacturing mode. After the generation the capability of doing it at all was usually disabled by blowing a special control fuse. Delivery of in particular the sPUK codes creates considerable security information logistics problems, which can entirely be avoided with the use of  on-board key generation.

Turkcell was the first provider to roll out a mobile signature service with "On Board Key Generation" functionality, which enables customers to create their signing and validation key pair, after they get the simcard. In this way GSM operators do not need to distribute signing PINs to customers. Customers can create their sPIN anew, on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{tr icon}} [http://www.turkcell.com.tr/index/0,1028,400004,00.html?banner=dig_20022007_turkcellmobilimza Turkcell.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In introduction of the Finnish Mobiilivarmenne&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobiilivarmenne.fi/en/bulletin/|title=News in English|publisher=Mobiilivarmenne portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; service in 2010, only one out of three operators chose to use this on-board key generation capability with user interaction. Cited reasons claimed it to be too hard for the user. Actual experience did show that those without it created easily non-functional registrations without any online indication of the status, while usage of on-board key generation always resulted in positive indication of success when the service became fully functional for the user. Also if a mobile phone version had issues with [[SIM Application Toolkit]] protocol, that became evident immediately during a registration process using on-board key generation.

'''Nedebang''' is a [[Papuan language]] spoken in the villages of Balungada and Baulang in the eastern district of [[Pantar island]] in the [[Alor archipelago]] of [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, Charles E., Tom Therik, Barbara Dix  Grimes &amp; Max Jacob. 1997. A guide to the people and languages of Nusa Tenggara. (Paradigma series B 1). Kupang, Indonesia: Universitas Kristen Artha Wacana and Alfa Omega Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stokhof, W. A. L. 1975. Preliminary notes on the Alor and Pantar languages (East Indonesia). (Pacific Linguistics B-43). Canberra: Australian National University.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also Nedebang speakers in Air Panas, administratively part of Balungada but located 1&amp;nbsp;km from the main village.

Nedebang is an extremely [[endangered language]]. It is no longer used as the language of daily communication, even within the home. [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] or [[Malay_trade_and_creole_languages#Alor_Malay|Alor Malay]] is used widely. Some residents of Bolungada are also fluent in Tewa; and some residents of Air Panas speak the Baranusa dialect of the [[Alorese|Alor language]] (not to be confused with Alor Malay). There are fewer than 200 speakers of Nedebang and the youngest speakers are in their 50s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gary|first=Holton,|date=2006|title=Preliminary notes on the Nedebang language|url=http://hdl.handle.net/11122/6839|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The name Nedebang is widely recognized by speakers, though some prefer the name Klamu. The former refers to an ancestral village located on a ridge above the area in which the speakers now reside. This area is reportedly still used for gardening and for traditional ceremonies. The term Klamu refers to a tribe (Indonesian ''suku''). The Klamu people moved from Nedebang to the coast prior to Indonesian independence, probably in the 1930s. Religion plays a significant role in the social and linguistic dynamics of the region. With the exception of Air Panas, the people of Balungada are Christian, and most residents are of Klamu descent. In contrast, the villages of Baulang and Air Panas are Islamic and contain significant populations of Austronesian-speakers who have migrated from Baranusa. The language thus appears to be more viable in Balungada. There appears to be no strong dialect division within Nedebang.

[[File:Northeast Caucasus languages map en.svg|thumb|Main areas of Northeast Caucasian languages]]

The '''Northeast Caucasian languages''', or '''Nakh-Daghestanian languages''', are a [[language family]] spoken in the [[Republics of Russia|Russian republics]] of [[Dagestan]], [[Chechnya]] and [[Ingushetia]] and in northern [[Azerbaijan]] as well as in [[diaspora]] populations in [[Western Europe]], [[Peoples of the Caucasus in Turkey|Turkey]] and the [[Middle East]]. They are occasionally called '''North Caspian''', as opposed to ''North Pontic'' for the [[Northwest Caucasian languages]].

==Name of the family==
Several names have been in use for this family. The most common term, ''Northeast Caucasian,'' contrasts the three established families of the Caucasus language area: ''Northeast Caucasian, [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]]'' (Abkhaz–Adyghean), and ''South Caucasian'' ([[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]]). This may be shortened to ''East Caucasian''. The term ''Nakh(o)-Dagestanian'' can be taken to reflect a primary division of the family into Nakh and Dagestanian branches, a view which is no longer widely accepted, or ''Dagestanian'' can subsume the entire family. The rare term ''North Caspian'' (as in bordering the Caspian Sea) is only used in opposition to the use of ''North Pontic'' (as in bordering the Black Sea) for the Northwest Caucasian languages.

==Linguistic features==

===Phonology===
Historically, Northeast Caucasian phonemic inventories were thought to be significantly smaller than those of the neighboring [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian family]].  However, more recent research has revealed that many Northeast Caucasian languages are much more phoneme-rich than previously believed, with some languages containing as many as 70 consonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=George|title=Introduction to the Study of the Languages of the Caucasus|year=2004|publisher=Lincom Europaq|location=Munich|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to numerous oral obstruents, many Northeast Caucasian languages also possess a number of back consonants, including [[uvular consonant|uvulars]], [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeals]], and glottal stops and fricatives. Northeast Caucasian phonology is also notable for its use of numerous [[secondary articulation]]s as contrastive features. Whereas English consonant classes are divided into voiced and voiceless phonemes, Northeast Caucasian languages are known to contrast phones into voiced, voiceless, [[ejective consonants|ejective]], and [[fortis and lenis|tense]] variants, which contributes to their large phonemic inventories. Some languages also include palatalization and labialization as contrastive features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=George|title=Introduction to the Study of the Languages of the Caucasus|year=2004|publisher=Lincom Europa|location=Munich|pages=49–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most languages in this family contrast tense and weak consonants. Tense consonants are characterized by the intensiveness of articulation, which naturally leads to a lengthening of these consonants.

In contrast to the generally large consonant inventories of Northeast Caucasian languages, most languages in the family have relatively few vowels.&lt;ref name="Matthews 1951 88"&gt;{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=W.K.|title=Languages of the U.S.S.R.|year=1951|publisher=Russel &amp; Russel|location=New York|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are some exceptions to this trend, such as [[Chechen language|Chechen]], which has at least twenty-eight vowels, diphthongs, and triphthongs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=George|title=Introduction to the Study of the Languages of the Caucasus|year=2004|publisher=Lincom Europa|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Pie chart|label1=[[Chechen language|Chechen]]|value1=33.6|label2=[[Avar language|Avar]]|value2=18.9|label3=[[Lezgian language|Lezgian]]|value3=16.3|label4=[[Dargwa language|Dargwa]]|value4=12.1|label5=[[Ingush language|Ingush]]|value5=8.0|label6=[[Lak language|Lak]]|value6=3.8|label7=Others|value7=7.3|caption=Percentage of Northeast Caucasian languages by speakers}}

===Morphology===
These languages can be characterized by strong [[suffix]]al [[agglutination]]. Weak tendencies towards [[inflection]] may be noted as well. [[Noun]]s display covert [[Noun class|nominal classification]], but partially overt cases of secondary origin can be observed too. The number of noun classes in individual languages range from two to eight. Regarding [[grammatical number]], there may be a distinction between singular and [[plural]], plurality itself may impact the class to which a noun belongs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=George|title=Introduction to the Study of the Languages of the Caucasus|year=2004|publisher=Lincom Europa|location=Munich|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, a grammatical [[collective number|collective]] is seen. Many languages distinguish ''[[List of grammatical cases#Place and time|local]]'' versus ''functional'' cases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=George|title=Introduction to the Study of the Languages of the Caucasus|year=2004|publisher=Lincom Europa|location=Munich|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to some degree also ''[[nominative case|casus rectus]]'' versus ''[[oblique case|casus obliquus]]''.

The inflectional paradigms are often based on partially classifying productive [[word stem|stem]] extensions ([[absolutive case|absolutive]], and [[oblique case|oblique]], [[ergative case|ergative]], and [[genitive case|genitive]] inflection.{{Clarify|date=April 2013}} Localization is mostly conveyed by [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]], but it can be also partly based on [[preverb]]s. [[Noun phrase]]s exhibit incomplete class [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]], group inflection{{Clarify|date=April 2013}} (on the noun) with partial [[Noun adjunct|attributive]] oblique marking, which may, in turn, carry a partially [[determiner (linguistics)|determining]] function.

====Ergativity====

Most Northeast Caucasian languages exhibit an [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive morphology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=R.M.W.|title=Studies in Ergativity|year=1987|publisher=Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.|location=Amsterdam|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that objects of transitive sentences and subjects of intransitive sentences both fall into a single grammatical case known as the absolutive.  Subjects of transitive sentences, however, carry a different marking to indicate that they belong to a separate case, known as the ergative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Valen|first=Robert D.|title=Grammatical Relations in Ergative Languages|journal=Studies in Language|year=1981|volume=5.3|pages=361–394|url=http://linguistics.buffalo.edu/people/faculty/vanvalin/rrg/Van%20Valin%20Grammatical%20Relations%20in%20ergative%20languages.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This distinction can be seen in the following two Archi sentences.  Note that objects and subjects of intransitive sentences carry no suffix, which is represented by the null suffix, -&lt;small&gt;∅&lt;/small&gt;.  Meanwhile, agents of transitive sentences take the ergative suffix, -mu.

&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Blue&lt;/span&gt; is used to mark ergative markers, as well as and transitive agents in the English translations.

&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Red&lt;/span&gt; is used to mark null morphemes, as well as transitive objects and intransitive subjects in the English translations.

====Noun classes====

Northeast Caucasian languages have between two and eight noun classes.&lt;ref name="Matthews 1951 88"/&gt;  In these languages, nouns are grouped into grammatical categories depending on certain semantic qualities, such as animacy and gender. Each noun class has a corresponding agreement prefix, which can attach to verbs or adjectives of that noun. Prefixes may also have plural forms, used in agreement with a plural noun.&lt;ref name="Plaster"&gt;{{cite web|last=Plaster|first=Keith|title=Noun classes grow on trees: noun classification in the North-East Caucasus|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/kplaster/publications/noun-classes-grow-trees-noun-classification-north-east-caucasus|publisher=Language and Representations (Tentative)|accessdate=20 April 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following table shows the noun–adjective agreement paradigm in the Tsez language. Colors are used to emphasize agreement between adjectival prefixes and noun classes.

A long-time classification divided the family into Nakh and Dagestanian branches, whence the term Nakho-Dagestanian.&lt;ref name="notNicho03"&gt;See [[#refNicho03|Nichols (2003)]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, attempts at reconstructing the protolanguage suggest that the Nakh languages are no more divergent from Dagestanian than the various branches of Dagestanian are from each other,&lt;ref name="notSchul09"&gt;See [[#refSchul09|Schulze (2009)]]&lt;/ref&gt; although this is still not universally accepted. The following outline, based on the work of linguist [[Bernard Comrie]] and others, has been adopted by ''[[Ethnologue]].'' An Avar–Andi–Dido branch was abandoned, but has been resurrected as the "New Type" languages in Schulze (2009, 2013), and Lak–Dargwa has likewise returned.

Population data is from ''Ethnologue'' 16th ed.

===Avar–Andic family===

Lak is spoken in two rayons of [[Dagestan]]: [[Kumux]] and Kuli (Vači).

===Lezgic family===
{{Main|Lezgic languages}}
Spoken in the Southeast [[Dagestan]] highlands and in Northern [[Azerbaijan]]. The [[Lezgian language]] or, as the [[Lezgian people]] themselves call it, ''Лезги чlал (lezgi ch'al),'' is the biggest in terms of the number of native speakers of all the languages of the Lezgic group (other languages from this group include Tabasaran, Udi, Tsakhur, and Rutul). They are spoken in the following rayons of [[Dagestan]]: [[Agulsky District|Agul]], [[Axty]], [[Derbent]] (Kvevar), [[Kasumxur]], [[Kurax]], [[Magaramkent]], [[Rutulsky District|Rutul]], [[Tabasaransky District|Tabasaran]], [[Usuxčay]], [[Xiv]] and [[Quba]] and [[Zaqatala District|Zaqatala]] in [[Azerbaijan]].    
Tabasaran was once thought to be the language with the largest number of grammatical cases at 54, which could, depending on the analysis, instead be the [[Tsez language]] with 64. 

Lezgian and Tabasaran are literary languages.

===Tsezic (Didoic) family===
{{Main|Tsezic languages}}
Spoken mostly in Southwest Dagestan. None are literary languages. Formerly classified geographically as East Tsezic (Hinukh, Bezta) and West Tsezic (Tsez, Khwarshi, Hunzib), these languages may actually form different subgroupings{{clarify|date=August 2013}} according to the latest research by [[#refSchul09|Schulze (2009)]]:

* Tsez–Hinukh
** [[Tsez language|Tsez (Dido)]] (12,500)
** [[Hinukh language|Hinukh (Hinux, Ginukh)]] (5 as of 2010)
* Bezhta–Hunzib–Khwarshi
** [[Bezhta language|Bezhta (Kapucha)]] (6,800)
** [[Hunzib language|Hunzib (Gunzib)]] (1,420)
** [[Khwarshi language|Khwarshi (Khvarshi)]] (8,500)&lt;ref name=Khalilova2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Khalilova|first=Zaira|title=A Grammar of Khwarshi|year=2009|publisher=LOT, Netherlands|location=University of Leiden|isbn=978-90-78328-93-3|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/14522/a+Grammar+of+Khwarshi.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All figures except for Khwarshi were retrieved from Ethnologue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com |title=Ethnologue}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These languages are spoken in [[Tsuntsin]] and [[Bežta]] areas of [[Dagestan]].

==Connections to other families==

===North Caucasian family (hypothetical)===
Some linguists such as [[Sergei Starostin]] think that the Northeast and [[Northwest Caucasian languages]] should be joined into a putative [[North Caucasian languages|North Caucasian]] family,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pereltsvaig|first=Asya|title=Languages of the World: An Introduction|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing shared vocabulary and typological features as evidence.&lt;ref name="Matthews 1951 87–88"&gt;{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=W.K.|title=Languages of the U.S.S.R.|year=1951|publisher=Russell &amp; Russell|location=New York|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This proposed family does not usually include the neighboring [[Kartvelian languages]].&lt;ref name="Matthews 1951 87–88"/&gt; This hypothesis is not well demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, J. 1997 &lt;u&gt;Nikolaev and Starostin's ''North Caucasian Etymological Dictionary'' and the Methodology of Long-Range Comparison: an assessment&lt;/u&gt; Paper presented at the 10th Biennial Non-Slavic Languages (NSL) Conference, Chicago, 8–10 May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connections to Hurrian and Urartian (disputed)===
Some linguists—notably [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] and Starostin—also see similarities between the Northeast Caucasian family and the extinct languages [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] and [[Urartian language|Urartian]].&lt;!--What exactly are those affinities?--&gt;
Hurrian was spoken in various parts of the [[Fertile Crescent]] in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC. Urartian was the language of [[Urartu]], a powerful state that existed between 1000 BC or earlier and 585 BC in the area centered on [[Lake Van]] in current [[Turkey]].

The two extinct languages have been grouped into the [[Hurro-Urartian languages|Hurro-Urartian]] family. Diakonoff proposed the name ''[[Alarodian languages|Alarodian]]'' for the union of Hurro-Urartian and Northeast Caucasian.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

However, the validity of both Alarodian and North Caucasian hypothetical families is rejected or viewed as doubtful by most historical linguists.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

====Agricultural vocabulary====
The [[Proto-Northeast Caucasian language]] had many terms for [[agriculture]], and [[Johanna Nichols]] has suggested that its speakers may have been involved in the development of agriculture in the [[Fertile Crescent]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[#refWue00|Wuethrich 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt; They had words for concepts such as ''[[yoke]]'', as well as fruit trees such as ''[[apple]]'' and ''[[pear]]'' that suggest agriculture was already well developed when the proto-language broke up.

{{IPA|/ɗ/}} is a [[voiced retroflex plosive]]. It may have an [[implosive]] quality for some speakers.

The voiceless stops {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} are always aspirated.

{{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/t/}} are [[dental consonants|dental]]

The velar fricative {{IPA|[x]}} is mainly used in the eastern dialect (Harar) as a phoneme. It is represented as {{angbr|kh}} in the [[Oromo orthography|Oromo script]] (''Qubee'') though it is pronounced as a {{angbr|k}} in most other dialects.{{sfnp|Lloret|1997|p=495}}

==Vowels==
Oromo has five vowels which all contrast long and short vowels. Sometimes there is a change in vowel quality when the vowel is short. Short vowels tend to be more centralized than their counterparts.

Though sometimes diphthongs may occur, there are none that occur in a word's unaltered form.

&lt;/div&gt;
{{Clear}}

==Tone==
When needed, the conventions for marking tone in written Oromo are as follows:
* [[acute accent]] - high tone
* [[grave accent]] - low tone
* [[circumflex]] - falling tone

Tones on long vowels are marked on the first vowel symbol.

In Oromo, the tone-bearing unit is the [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]] rather than the vowel of the syllable. A long vowel or a diphthong consists of two morae and can bear two tones. Each mora is defined as being of high or low tone. Only one high tone occurs per word and this must be on the final or penultimate mora. Particles do not have a high tone. (These include prepositions, clitic pronouns for subject and object, impersonal subject pronouns and focus markers.) There are therefore three possible "accentual patterns" in word roots.

Phonetically there are three tones: high, low and falling. Rules:
# On a long vowel, a sequence of high-low is realized as a falling tone.
# On a long vowel, a sequence of low-high is realized as high-high. (Occasionally it is a rising tone.)

This use of tone may be characterized as [[pitch accent]]. It is similar to that in [[Somali language|Somali]].

[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] is connected with tone. The high tone has strong stress; the falling tone has less stress and the low tone has no stress.

==Phonological processes==
===Allophones===
* {{IPA|/b/}} becomes {{IPA|/β/}} between two vowels.{{sfnp|Owens|1985|p=7}}
* {{IPA|/d/}} becomes {{IPA|/ð/}} between two vowels.
* {{IPA|/k/}} is pronounced as a [[voiceless velar fricative]] before {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/t/}}.{{sfnp|Owens|1985|p=5}}
* The {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/x/}} (i.e. the Arabic Kha) are used interchangeably in the Borana dialect.
* In the [[Gomma (woreda)|Goma]] dialect, vowels are [[Nasalization|nasalized]] before {{angbr|ng}} and {{angbr|ns}},{{sfnp|Owens|1985|p=2}}

===Epenthesis===
When a vowel occurs in word-initial position, a glottal stop ({{IPA|[ʔ]}}) is inserted before it.

===Elision===
* {{IPA|/n/}} is dropped before {{IPA|/w/}}.{{sfnp|Owens|1985|p=8}}
* {{IPA|/d t ɗ/}} are dropped before {{IPA|/n/}}.{{sfnp|Owens|1985|p=6}}


===Sandhi===
Phonological changes occur at morpheme boundaries ([[sandhi]]) for specific grammatical morphemes. There may be assimilation.

* The cluster {{IPA|/ln/}} becomes a [[gemination|geminated]] {{IPA|/ll/}}.{{sfnp|Owens|1985|p=7}}
* {{IPA|/bn/}} becomes {{IPA|/mn/}}
* {{IPA|/t/}} assimilates into the proceeding {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/ɗ/}} and {{IPA|/tʼ/}}.{{sfnp|Owens|1985|p=5-6}}
* {{IPA|/ɗ/}} becomes {{IPA|[ɾ]}} between vowels

'''Purushottam Nagesh Oak''' (2 March 1917&amp;nbsp;– 4 December 2007), commonly referred to as '''P. N. Oak''', was an [[India]]n writer, journalist and [[Indian National Army]] freedom fighter,&lt;ref name=rediff1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oak1/&gt; notable for his Hindu-centric [[historical revisionism]]. Oak's "Institute for Rewriting Indian History" issued a quarterly periodical called ''Itihas Patrika'' in the 1980s.

Oak's claims, e.g. that Christianity and Islam are both derivatives of [[Hinduism]], or that [[Vatican City]], [[Kaaba]], [[Westminster Abbey]] and the [[Taj Mahal]] were once [[Hindu temple]]s to [[Shiva]],&lt;ref name=Oak2/&gt; and their reception in Indian popular culture have been noted by observers of contemporary Indian society. In addition to this Oak again asserted that the Vatican was allegedly originally a Vedic creation called Vatika and that the [[Pope|Papacy]] was also originally a Vedic Priesthood. He wrote books in three languages. History books written by him have inspired several court cases to correct the history based on his theories.&lt;ref name=india1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ht1/&gt;

==Life==
Oak was born in 1917 at [[Indore]] in the erstwhile [[Indore State|Princely State of Indore]], [[British India]].&lt;ref name=rediff1/&gt; According to his own account,&lt;ref name=Oak1/&gt; he completed an M.A. ([[Dr. B. R. Ambedkar University|Agra]]) and a law degree (LL.B. [[University of Mumbai|Mumbai]]), was an official in the Ministry for Information, and wrote various journalistic pieces. Dozens of blogs and websites refer to him as "Professor" P. N. Oak.&lt;ref name=Anon2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref name=gary /&gt; Before joining the army, he had also worked as an English tutor at [[Fergusson College]] in Pune.&lt;ref name=Oak1/&gt; 

Later he joined the army and was posted in Singapore. During [[World War II]], he was at first with the army of the [[British Raj]] in [[British Malaya]] at the age of 24. He joined the [[Indian National Army]] after Singapore fell to the Japanese. He acted as an assistant to [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] in the [[Indian National Army]] and then as an ADC to General [[J. R. Bhonsle]], chief of the Indian National Army. He also worked as a commentator for the [[Azad Hind Radio]].&lt;ref name=rediff1&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/jan/22netaji.htm Rediff On The NeT: Mahatma, Subhas Chandra Bose were fond of each other]. Rediff.com (24 February 1946).&lt;/ref&gt;

"From 1947 to 1974 his profession has been mainly journalism having worked on the editorial staffs of the [[Hindustan Times]] and [[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]], as a [[Gazetted Officer (India)|Class I Gazetted officer]] in the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, India]]; and as editor in the [[Embassy of the United States, New Delhi|Embassy of the United States]]' Information Service."&lt;ref name=Oak1 /&gt; In 1964, he founded an organisation called ''Institute for Rewriting Indian History''.

He died on 4 December 2007, at 3.30 am at his Pune residence aged 90.

==Revisionist theories==
Intent on rectifying what he believes to be "biased and distorted versions of India's history produced by the invaders and colonizers", Oak wrote several books and articles on Indian history and founded an "Institute for Rewriting Indian History" in 1964.
According to Oak, modern secular and [[Marxist]] historians have fabricated "idealized versions" of India's past and drained it of its "Vedic context and content". [[Srinivas Aravamudan]] noted that Oak's work typically resorts to "deep punning"&lt;ref name=aravamudan /&gt;&amp;nbsp;– associating Sanskrit sound-alikes with non-Sanskrit religious terms such as ''[[Holy See|Vatican]]''=''vatika'' "hermitage", ''Christianity''=''Krishna-netti or Chrisn-nity'' "ethics of Krishna or the way of Krishna" ''Islam''=''ishalayam'' "temple of God", ''[[Abraham]]'' as an aberration of ''[[Brahma]]'', and ''[[George (given name)|George]]'' as an aberration of Garg.&lt;ref name=Oak2003 /&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=k0RPGAu3vokC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=oak+deep+punning+vatika&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xQszKc9clN&amp;sig=_PTLtzjlm5HPC84AR8MTcyWRaRg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q9pQT5L7Oon3ggfF7P3IDQ&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Kaaba&amp;f=false] Based on this, Oak claims that both Christianity and Islam allegedly originated as distortions of "Vedic" beliefs.

===Academic and government response===
Oak finds some mention in passing as trustworthy in academic literature on the [[Hindutva]] wing of [[Hindu nationalism]]. Aravamudan (2005) calls him a "mythistorian"&lt;ref name=aravamudan/&gt; whose life's work may be summarised by the title of his work ''World Vedic Heritage: A History of Histories, Presenting a Unique Unified Field Theory of History that from the Beginning of Time the World Practised Vedic and Spoke Sanskrit''. 

[[Edwin Bryant (author)|Edwin Bryant]] in his work on Indo-Aryan theory says "The various scholars whose work I have examined here are a disparate group. They range from brilliant intellectuals like [[Sri Aurobindo|Aurobindo]], to professional scholars like [[B. B. Lal]], to what most academics would consider “crackpots,” like P. N. Oak. 1 The primary feature they share is that they have taken it upon themselves to oppose the theory of Aryan invasions and migrations—hence the label Indigenous Aryanism."&lt;ref name=bryant2001 /&gt; [[Giles Tillotson]] describes Oak's work as a "startling piece of pseudo-scholarship".&lt;ref name=Parker2008 /&gt;

While Oak's theories have been rejected by some, they have found a popular following among others, specially among some members of India's [[Hindutva]]s,&lt;ref name=Ahmed1993 /&gt; ([[N. Ram]], editor of ''[[The Hindu]]'', calls him a "[[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|Sangh]] historian"&lt;ref name=Ram2001 /&gt;), [[Indocentrism|Indocentrists]] and the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]] mainly but not only represented by author Stephen Knapp. Art historian Rebecca Brown describes Oak's books as "revisionist history as subtle as Captain Russell's smirk" (referring to a character in the Hindi movie ''[[Lagaan]]'').&lt;ref name=Brown2004 /&gt;

Although not anti-government in nature, Oak's book "Some Blunders in Indian Historical Research" was banned from the Parliament's library by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha (lower House) as noted in news archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are also other claims of government suppression, e.g. "Allegedly, Indira Gandhi's government tried to ban [Oak's book on Taj Mahal] and some would say the Indian government has been politically motivated in suppressing this theory".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.envocare.co.uk/taj_mahal_history.htm The Taj Mahal, an Historical Perspective, web page by Envocare UK]. Envocare.co.uk.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity as Vedic Chrisn-nity or Krishna-neeti Theory===
Oak claims that Christianity was originally a Vedic religion following Krishna and claims that Christianity was originally known by either the names Chrisn-nity or Krishna-neeti (with Oak alleging these meant "The way of Krishna" or "The Justice of Lord Krishna") these generally follow in line with Oak's other theories and claims that the Vatican was allegedly originally called Vatika and that the Papacy was originally a "Vedic Priesthood" until [[Constantine the Great]] around 312 A.D killed the "Vedic pontiff" and installed in his place a representative of the tiny Christian sect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vnn.org/editorials/ET9906/ET04-4033.html VNN Editorial – Cities And Regions Since] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118124259/http://www.vnn.org/editorials/ET9906/ET04-4033.html |date=18 January 2012 }}. Vnn.org (4 June 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Oak's followers make the following claims about what they claim as alleged Krishna-neeti. "Jesus went to India between ages 13 and 30 to learn Krishna-neeti (Christianity) from sages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blogcritics.org/books/article/book-review-new-birth-or-rebirth|title=Book Review: New Birth or Rebirth – Jesus Talks with Krishna (Great Conversations) by Ravi Zacharias}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taj Mahal Theory===
In his book ''Taj Mahal: The True Story'', Oak claims that the [[Taj Mahal]] was originally a Shiva temple and a [[Rajput]] palace named ''Tejo Mahalaya'' seized by [[Shah Jahan]] and adopted as a tomb. He argues that may be this temple was built by Indian King Jai Singh I. He says that [[Mahal (palace)|Mahal]] is a word to describe a royal palace and not a tomb and after seizure by Shah Jahan, the name was changed to Taj Mahal.&lt;ref name=Oak3 /&gt;

The Taj, Oak says, is a "typical illustration of how all historic buildings and townships from [[Kashmir]] to [[Kanyakumari|Cape Comorin]] though of Hindu origin have been ascribed to this or that Muslim ruler or courtier".&lt;ref name=Oak3 /&gt; He goes on to propose Hindu origins for the tombs of [[Humayun]], [[Akbar]] and [[Tomb of I'timād-ud-Daulah|I'timād-ud-Daulah]] and "all historic buildings" in India as well as Vatican City,&lt;ref name=Oak1999 /&gt; the Kaaba and [[Stonehenge]].

Oak says that well-known western authorities on architecture including [[Ernest Binfield Havell]], Mrs. Kenoyer and [[William Wilson Hunter]] have written that the Taj Mahal is built in the Hindu temple style,&lt;ref name=Oak3 /&gt; asserting that Havel says the plan of the ancient Hindu temple of [[Java]], the [[Prambanan]], is identical with that of the Taj Mahal.&lt;ref name=Oak3 /&gt; Also, he argues out that the octagonal shape of the Taj Mahal has a special Hindu significance, because Hindus alone have [[Guardians of the directions#Directions in Hindu tradition|special names for the eight directions and the celestial guards]] assigned to them.&lt;ref name=Oak3 /&gt; He argues that the [[finial]] of the Taj Mahal is a [[trishula]] with a [[Kalasha]], holding two bent mango leaves and a coconut, which is a sacred Hindu motif.&lt;ref name=Oak3 /&gt;

Oak claims that Hindu ornaments and symbols were effaced from the Taj, whose sealed chambers hold the remnants, including a [[lingam]], of the original temple, and that [[Mumtaz Mahal]] was not buried at her [[cenotaph]].

In support of these claims, Oak presents [[radiocarbon dating]] results of the wood from the riverside doorway of the Taj, quotes from European travellers' accounts and the Taj's Hindu architectural features. Oak further alleges that eyewitness accounts of the Taj Mahal's construction as well as Shah Jahan's construction orders and voluminous financial records are elaborate frauds meant to hide its Hindu origin.&lt;ref name=Oak3 /&gt;

Oak petitioned the Indian parliament demanding that the Taj be declared a Hindu monument and that cenotaphs and sealed apartments be opened to determine whether lingams or other remains were hidden in them.&lt;ref name=Oak3/&gt; According to Oak, the [[government of India]]'s refusal to allow him unfettered access amounts to a [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] against Hinduism. The Indian government has maintained that out of respect for the dead, unnecessary openings of cenotaphs and sealed rooms cannot be allowed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Oak's denial of Islamic architecture in India has been described as one of the "more extreme manifestations of [[Islamophobia|anti-Muslim]] sentiment" in [[Maharashtra|Maharashtrian]] popular culture.&lt;ref name=ErnstShimmel1992 /&gt; [[K. N. Panikkar]] locates Oak's work in the Hindutva movement's attempt to foster a [[Communalism (South Asia)|communal]] understanding of Indian history.&lt;ref name=Panikkar1 /&gt; [[Tapan Raychaudhuri]] has referred to him as "a 'historian' much respected by the [[Sangh Parivar]]."&lt;ref name=Raychaudhuri2000 /&gt;

In 2000 India's Supreme Court dismissed Oak's petition to declare that a Hindu king had built the Taj Mahal by saying he had a "bee in his bonnet" about the Taj.&lt;ref name=Tribune1 /&gt; Till date, as of 2017, several court cases about Taj Mahal being a Hindu temple have been inspired by Oak's theory.&lt;ref name=india1&gt;Siraj Qureshi, [http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/taj-mahal-court-petition-shiva-temple/1/1024727.html "Another court petition challenges Taj Mahal's story as a symbol of love"], [[India Today]], 12 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ht1&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-the-taj-mahal-a-mausoleum-or-a-shiva-temple-cic-tells-government-to-clarify/story-bYyd6mFUmFbrIjOJnbP9CI.html "Is Taj Mahal a mausoleum or a Shiva temple? CIC asks govt to clarify"], [[Hindustan Times]], 10 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, [[Archaeological Survey of India]] stated there was no evidence to suggest the monument ever housed a temple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/vinay-katiyar-taj-mahal-tejo-mahalaya-temple-supreme-court-bee-in-bonnet-theory-asi/1/1071039.html BJP's Vinay Katiyar now calls Taj Mahal a Hindu temple - a 'bee in bonnet' theory that Supreme Court once rejected] [[India Today]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giles Tillotson]] calls Oak's claims as a "desperate bid to assign a new meaning to the Taj" and "pseudo-scholarship". He states that Oak interprets the statements of ''[[Padshahnama]]'' about Shah Jahan's purchase of the land for the Taj from [[Jai Singh I]] upon where a mansion built by an ancestor of the Raja earlier existed, to claim that Taj Mahal was a wonder of ancient Hinduism. Tillotoson adds that no evidence is offered by Oak to redate it to thirteen centuries earlier. He adds that the technical know-how to construct structural buildings didn't exist in pre-Mughal India, the only surviving architecture being rock-cut or monolithic. He points that Oak later dropped this claim and claimed it to be from 12th century. He adds that Oak claims Mughals built nothing and only converted Hindu buildings. In relation to similarity with buildings of [[West Asia]], Oak also claims them all to be "products of Hindu architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4zYd848UJkC&amp;pg=PA115|author=[[Giles Tillotson]]|title=Taj Mahal|pages=112-114|publisher= [[Harvard University Press]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kaaba Theory: Vedic origins===

In a 13-page pamphlet titled ''Was Kaaba a Hindu Temple?'', Oak derives a claim of a "Vedic past of Arabia" based on an inscription mentioning the legendary Indian king [[Vikramāditya]] that Oak claims was found inside a dish inside the Kaaba. According to Oak, the text of the alleged inscription is taken from the page 315 of an anthology of poetry entitled ''Sayar-ul-Okul'' (''Se’-arul Oqul'' meaning the ''memorable words''),&lt;ref name=Oak1966 /&gt; compiled in 1742 on the orders of a "Sultan Salim" (the actual Sultan at the time being [[Mahmud I]], sultan [[Selim III]] lived from 1761 to 1808) from the earlier work of prophet Muhammed's uncle [[Amr ibn Hishām]] (poetic name "Abu al-Ḥakam" or ابوالحكم meaning the "Father of wisdom") who had refused to convert to Islam, and, first modern version published in 1864 in Berlin and a subsequent edition was published in Beirut in 1932.&lt;ref name=vishva1&gt;"Hindu Vishva", Volume 27, Issues 4-11,  pp. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Oak goes on to state that the anthology is kept in the "[http://195.175.105.214/yordam.htm Makhtab-e-Sultania Library]" ([http://www.gsl.gsu.edu.tr/en/ Galatasaray Mekteb-i Sultani] or Galatasaray Imperial School) in [[Istanbul]] in [[Turkey]], which is now also known as [[Galatasaray High School|Galatasaray Lisesi]] school.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Simon Altaf, 2011, [https://books.google.com.sg/books?isbn=1599160528 World War III - Unmasking the End-Times Beast: Unmasking End Time Beast], African-Israel International Union of Israelite Qahalim, {{ISBN|1599160528}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Palenquero''' or '''palenque''' (Palenquero: ''Lengua'') is a [[Spanish-based creole language]] spoken in [[Colombia]]. Palenquero is the only Spanish-based [[Creole language|creole]] in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/world/americas/18colombia.html |title=San Basilio de Palenque Journal - A Language, Not Quite Spanish, With African Echoes - NYTimes.com |publisher=www.nytimes.com |accessdate=2010-02-13 | first=Simon | last=Romero | date=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnic group which speaks this creole consisted of 7,470 people in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ministerio de Cultura|title=Palenqueros, descendientes de la insurgencia anticolonial|url=http://www.mincultura.gov.co/areas/poblaciones/comunidades-negras-afrocolombianas-raizales-y-palenqueras/Documents/Caracterizaci%C3%B3n%20comunidad%20palequera.pdf|pages=1|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palenquero is spoken in [[Colombia]], in the village of [[San Basilio de Palenque]] which is southeast of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], and in some neighbourhoods of [[Barranquilla]], and has existed for approximately three to four centuries.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bickerton|first=Derek|last2=Escalante|first2=Aquilas|date=January 1970|title=Palenquero: A spanish-based creole of northern colombia|journal=Lingua|language=en|volume=24|pages=254–267|doi=10.1016/0024-3841(70)90080-x|issn=0024-3841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2018}}
[[File:033 Palenquero Cartagena Colombia 2013.JPG|thumb|A Palenquero woman selling fruit in the Plaza de San Pedro Claver, [[Cartagena, Colombia]]]]The village was formed by escaped slaves ([[maroon (people)|Maroon]]s) and sometimes [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] around 1604 under the leadership of Benkos Biojo. These slaves ran from Cartagena, building their own communities to the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lipski|first=John|date=2018-01|title=Palenquero vs. Spanish negation: Separate but equal?|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lingua.2017.12.007|journal=Lingua|volume=202|pages=44–57|doi=10.1016/j.lingua.2017.12.007|issn=0024-3841}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since many slaves had not been subjected to a lot of contact with people of European descent, the ''palenqueros'' spoke Creole languages constructed from the Spanish language and their own African ones.

Spanish speakers are usually unable to understand Palenquero, even though Palenquero borrows many lexical elements from the Spanish language. The people of Palenque tend to speak Spanish to outsiders and Palenquero to specific individuals within their community. The speakers kept this language secret from outsiders on purpose. This language is a powerful identity marker for the speakers. It is a way for the people to differentiate themselves from non-speakers. Those who speak both languages can switch from Palenquero to Spanish, and vice versa, making them two distinct languages and not just a dialectical difference. For a long time, individuals who heard this language being spoken thought of it as "broken Spanish".

Ten percent of the population under 25 years of age spoke Palenquero in 1998. It is more commonly spoken by the elderly. It's sole substrate is likely the [[Kongo language|Kikongo language]], which is spoken in the [[Republic of Congo|Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Angola]]. Palenquero words like "[[:en:wikt:ngombe#Palanquero|ngombe]]", which means cattle, are found in several [[Bantu languages]].

== Grammar ==
Similar to several other creole languages, Palenquero grammar lacks inflectional morphology, meaning that nouns, adjectives, verbs and determiners are almost always invariant.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/i.e.mackenzie/palenque.htm|title=Palenquero|last=Mackenzie|first=Ian|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender ===
Grammatical gender is non-existent, and adjectives derived from Spanish default to the masculine form: ''lengua africano'' ‘African language’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Plurality ===
Plurality is marked with the particle ''ma''. (''for example: ma posá 'houses' ''). This particle is believed to derive from Kikongo, a Bantu language, and is the sole Kikongo-derived inflection present in Palenquero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=3f2st1vKvMIC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=kikongo+plural&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-_ZZElL5hM&amp;sig=e1zT3rBHJS2Mlpe-Sztciekvg6g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj79pmCrpnZAhUGNI8KHSrhBQEQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=kikongo%20plural&amp;f=false|title=Linguistic Simplicity and Complexity: Why Do Languages Undress?|last=McWhorter|first=John H.|date=2011-06-30|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=|isbn=9781934078402|location=|pages=92|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The younger speakers of Palenquero utilize ''ma'' for plurality more so than the speakers that came before them.

This particle is usually dropped with cardinal numbers greater than 2: ''ma ndo baka'' ‘two cows’ but ''tresi año'' ‘13 years’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Copula ====
There are four copulas in Palenquero: ''e'', ''ta'', ''jue'', and ''senda''. ''E'' roughly corresponds to 'ser' in Spanish and is used for permanent states, and ''ta'' is similar to the Spanish 'estar' in that it used for temporary states and locatives. ''Jue'' is used as a copula for nouns and ''senda'' is only found with predicative nouns and adjectives referring to permanent states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=L3p9DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA455&amp;lpg=PA455&amp;dq=%22palenquero+possesses+four+copulas%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L4ilX010E5&amp;sig=-XeulU5tOKL_JtpUDH7aQVLVMOM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG7YWtzaDZAhUML48KHQwMBOgQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22palenquero%20possesses%20four%20copulas%22&amp;f=false|title=The Oxford Guide to the Romance Languages|last=Ledgeway|first=Adam|last2=Maiden|first2=Martin|date=2016-09-05|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780191063251|location=|pages=455|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==
Some 300 words of African origin have been identified in Palenquero,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=mv4iAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=el+vocabulario+africano+de+palenque+schwegler&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QCnuz_2lXz&amp;sig=bTMfgQPi1paIkERRJqK9by-vAmU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGkMfqmNLaAhUC2o8KHYctDPkQ6AEIYDAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=el%20vocabulario%20africano%20de%20palenque%20schwegler&amp;f=false|title=Palenque, Cartagena y Afro-Caribe: historia y lengua|last=Moñino|first=Yves|last2=Schwegler|first2=Armin|date=2013-02-07|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=|isbn=9783110960228|location=|pages=171|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many believed to originate in the [[Kongo language|Kikongo]] language. A comprehensive list and proposed etymologies are provided in Moñino and Schwegler's "Palenque, Cartagena y Afro-Caribe: historia y lengua" (2002).  Many of the words that come from African origin, include plant, animal, insect and landscape names.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another handful of words are believed to originate from Portuguese (''for example: mai 'mother'; ten 'has'; ele 'he/she'; bae 'go').''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11820">'''Phonocentrism''' is the belief that sounds and speech are inherently superior to, or more primary than, written language. Those who espouse phonocentric views maintain that spoken language is the primary and most fundamental method of communication whereas writing is merely a derived method of capturing speech. Many also believe that spoken language is inherently richer and more intuitive than written language. These views also impact perceptions of sign languages – especially in the United States. [[Oralism]] is the belief that deaf students should use sounds, speech reading, and primarily English instead of signs in their education. [[Alexander Graham Bell]] is a well known proponent for oralism of the deaf – such phonocentristic views are rejected by the [[Deaf community]]. Phonocentrism in the context of deafness is referred to as [[audism]].

Some writers have argued that philosophers such as [[Plato]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], and [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] have promoted phonocentric views. [[Walter Ong]], who has also expressed support for the idea of phonocentrism, has argued that the culture of the [[United States]] is particularly non-phonocentric.

Some philosophers and linguists, notably including the philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]], have used the term "phonocentrism" to criticize what they see as a disdain for written language. Derrida has argued that phonocentrism developed because the immediacy of speech has been regarded as closer to the [[Metaphysics of presence|presence]] of subjects than writing. He believed that the [[binary opposition]] between speech and writing is a form of [[logocentrism]].&lt;ref name=Sarupp35&gt;{{Harvnb|Sarup|1993|pp=35–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocates of phonocentrism==
The philosopher [[John Searle]] has argued that Plato expressed some skepticism about the value of writing relative to speech.&lt;ref name="Searle"/&gt; The rhetorician and philosopher Walter Ong also believes that Plato was phonocentric. He argues that Plato had a clear preference for "orality over writing."&lt;ref name=Ongp164&gt;{{Harvnb|Ong|2004|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he notes that Plato's belief in phonocentrism was both contrived and defended textually, and is therefore paradoxical.&lt;ref name=Ongp164/&gt;

Rousseau also held views that have since been characterized as phonocentric. He discussed the topic in ''[[Essay on the Origin of Languages]]''. He believed that speech was a more natural form of communication than writing, which he viewed as a somewhat parasitic and unhealthy derivation of speech.&lt;ref name=Sarupp39&gt;{{Harvnb|Sarup|1993|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguist [[Leonard Bloomfield]] has also expressed the belief that spoken languages are the primary form of language, and that written languages should be viewed as derived from them. He argued that "writing is not language, but merely a way of recording language."&lt;ref name=Fasold&gt;{{Harvnb|Fasold|2003|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saussure believed that speech should be treated as the primary topic of linguistics. He believed that writing was given too much attention in the field of linguistics. In ''[[Course in General Linguistics]],'' Saussure argued that "language and writing are two distinct systems of signs." He believed that both systems influenced each other, but that writing could obscure language. He argued that writing obscures how pronunciation forms because of its influence on pronunciation. Saussure drew a distinction between phonetic languages and languages such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]] in which a single character represents a word. He believed that only phonetic languages cause problems for linguists.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|1991|pp=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ong has argued that American society is particularly opposed to phonocentrism. He believes that one cause of this is the fact that written documents, such as the [[United States Constitution]], form a key part of American national identity. He also notes that many Americans view the reality of words as defined by dictionaries rather than by vocal speech. He has stated, "We are so literate in ideology that we think writing comes naturally. We have to remind ourselves from time to time that writing is completely and irremediably artificial."&lt;ref name=Ongp137&gt;{{Harvnb|Ong|1994|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ong believes that writing is necessary for transmitting knowledge in a technological culture. He maintains that speech should be viewed as primary because it is drawn from the unconscious while writing requires conscious attention: "Speech is structured through the entire fabric of the human person. Writing depends on consciously contrived rules."&lt;ref name=Ongp138&gt;{{Harvnb|Ong|1994|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also states that writing and speech are each privileged in specific ways, and that they depend upon each other for identification and clarity.&lt;ref name=Ongp1656&gt;{{Harvnb|Ong|2004|pp=165–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derrida==
Derrida believed that the fields of philosophy, literature, anthropology, and linguistics had become highly phonocentric.&lt;ref name=Hoganp249&gt;{{Harvnb|Hogan|2000|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that phonocentrism was an important example of what he saw as [[Western philosophy]]'s logocentrism.&lt;ref name=Sarupp35/&gt; He maintained that phonocentrism developed due to the human desire to determine a central means of authentic self-expression. He argued that speech is no better than writing, but is assigned that role by societies that seek to find a transcendental form of expression. This form of expression is said to allow one to better express transcendental truths and to allow one to understand key [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] ideas.&lt;ref name=Sarupp35/&gt; Derrida believed that phonocentric cultures associate speech with a time before meaning was corrupted by writing. He saw phonocentrism as part of the influence of [[Romanticism]], specifically its belief in a time in which people lived in harmony and unity with nature. Derrida did not believe that there was any ideal state of unity with nature. He also argued that speech suffers from many of the same inherent flaws as writing.&lt;ref name=Hoganp249/&gt;

[[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]] has characterized Derrida's opposition to phonocentrism as part of his campaign against "human egocentricity."&lt;ref name=holmep149&gt;{{Harvnb|Holme|2004|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida points out that the expression of human views is often dominated by the voices of humans.&lt;ref name=holmep149/&gt; He also noted that writing frees expression from the human voice and is more exterior and stable than speech. He believed that this makes it a more effective carrier of meaning. Randal Holme has argued that Derrida preferred writing because he associated it with "the construction of meaning and the creation of category."&lt;ref name=holmep149/&gt;

Derrida identified the often perceived difference between the value of speaking versus writing as one of the key binary oppositions of logocentrism. He attempted to [[Deconstruction|deconstruct]] this opposition by arguing that speech can be seen as derived from writing as easily as writing is seen as derived from speech. He wrote that societies often make determinations that unfairly casts writing as an inferior method of communication and self-expression.&lt;ref name=Sarupp35/&gt;

Derrida insisted that the written word has its own value, and is likely not "the simple 'supplement to the spoken word.'"&lt;ref name=Derridap7&gt;{{Harvnb|Derrida|1998|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Of Grammatology]]'' he uses this method of analysis to critique the views that Rousseau expressed in ''Essay on the Origin of Languages''.&lt;ref name=Derridap7/&gt; Derrida argued that Rousseau's views were contradictory and often undermined his arguments.&lt;ref name="Sarupp39"/&gt;

===Criticism===
Searle has criticized Derrida's claims of historical opposition to Phonocentrism. Searle believes that many philosophers, including [[Aristotle]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Gottlob Frege]], and [[Bertrand Russell]], have "tended to emphasize written language as the more perspicuous vehicle of logical relations."&lt;ref name=Searle&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that support for ordinary speech over written language only emerged in the 1950s with the advent of [[Ordinary language philosophy]]. He also contends that Derrida makes sweeping misinformed claims about the history of writing.&lt;ref name=Searle/&gt;

[[Geoffrey Hartman]] has also criticized Derrida's accounts of phonocentrism. He has argued that Derrida failed to provide an account of the historical forces that have influenced phonocentric and non-phonocentric cultures. Ong has expressed some agreement with Hartman's critique. Though he describes Derrida's view as "brilliant and to a degree serviceable," he believes that it "plays with the paradoxes of textuality alone and in historical isolation." Though Ong believes that it is impossible to separate writing from its pretext, he contends that "this does not mean that text can be reduced to orality."&lt;ref name=Ongp165&gt;{{Harvnb|Ong|2004|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The software had positive reviews in ''Computers, Reading and Language Arts'', ''The New York Times'', ''The Boston Globe'', ''Popular Computing'', ''Harvard University Gazette'', ''Electronic Learning'', ''Teaching and Computers'', ''Informatica Oggi'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tonfoni|first1=Graziela|title=Il computer a scuola: Intervista con Bertram Bruce|journal=Informatica Oggi|date=1984|pages=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''English Journal'', ''Early Years/K-8, Computer Update'', ''Classroom Computer Learning'', ''The Computing Teacher'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Software Reviews|journal=Computing Teacher|date=1985|volume=1983|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Language Arts'', ''Today's Education'', and many other publications.

==Hardware==

Quill ran on [[Apple II Plus|Apple II+]] and [[Apple IIe]] computers with 64K bytes of [[Random-access memory|memory]] and required two [[floppy disk]] drives, a [[monochrome monitor]], an 80-character, upper and lower case card, and a printer. 

==Software components==

Quill comprised four interrelated programs. ''Writer’s Assistant''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levin|first1=J. A.|last2=Boruta|first2=M. J.|last3=Vasconcellos|first3=M. T.|title=Microcomputer-based environments for writing: A writer’s assistant|journal=Classroom computers and cognitive science|date=1983|pages=219–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a general [[word processor]] that could be used independently. However, within ''Quill'' it was not invoked by name but accessed indirectly by functions in ''PLANNER'', ''LIBRARY'', or ''MAILBAG'', such as “seeing” someone else’s text in the ''LIBRARY''.  Students decided which program to use according to their purpose for writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Andee|last2=Bruce|first2=Bertram C.|title=Alternate realizations of purpose in computer-supported writing|journal=Theory into Practice|date=1990|volume=29|pages=256–263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''PLANNER'' was a tool that helped students organize ideas for writing, then share their newly created organizing tools. ''LIBRARY'' was a writing environment in which students could make their writing accessible to others by storing it with the full authors’ names, the full title, and keywords indicating topic, genre, or other characteristics of the piece. The keywords represented an early use of [[hashtag]]s. ''MAILBAG'' was an in-class [[email]] system in which students could send messages to other students, the teacher, small groups, or a bulletin board. Those messages could be forwarded to other classrooms using a variety of networking tools available at the time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2095">'''{{Lang|de|Romantische Oper}}''' (German for "romantic opera") was a genre of early nineteenth-century German [[opera]], developed not from the German [[Singspiel]] of the eighteenth-century but from the [[opéra comique|opéras comiques]] of the [[French Revolution]]. It offered opportunities for an increasingly important role for the [[orchestra]], and greater dramatic possibilities for reminiscence [[Motif (music)|motif]]s – phrases that are identified with a place, person or idea and which, when re-used in a work, remind the listener of the place, person or idea in question.

[[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' (1821) inaugurated the genre, which increasingly became associated with a distinctively German national style, as exemplified by composers such as [[Heinrich Marschner]] (e.g. ''[[Der Vampyr]]'' and ''[[Hans Heiling]]''), [[Albert Lortzing]] (e.g. ''[[Undine (Lortzing)|Undine]]'') and [[Louis Spohr]]. Themes explored included [[nature]], the [[supernatural]], the [[Middle Ages]] and popular culture, specifically [[folklore]]. Musically, German [[folk music]] also served as an inspiration. Spoken dialogue continued to be used between musical numbers.

The genre reached its apogee in the early works of [[Richard Wagner]], specifically ''[[Die Feen]]'', ''[[Das Liebesverbot]]'', ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'' and ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'', although these differed from their predecessors in not using spoken dialogue. His later operas developed the reminiscence motif into the more protean [[Leitmotif]] and gradually abandoned many of the themes of ''{{lang|de|romantische Oper}}'', while still largely focused on myths, legends and nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3043">{{IPA notice}}
In [[Languages of Mexico|Mexican linguistics]], '''saltillo''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]], meaning "little skip") refers to a [[glottal stop]] consonant, {{IPAblink|ʔ}}. It was given that name by the early grammarians of [[Classical Nahuatl language|Classical Nahuatl]]. In a number of other [[Nahuan languages]], the sound cognate to Classical Nahuatl's glottal stop is {{IPAblink|h}}, and the term ''saltillo'' is applied to either pronunciation. The saltillo is often spelled with an [[apostrophe]], though it is sometimes spelled (with either pronunciation) {{angle bracket|h}}, or, when pronounced {{IPA|[h]}}, {{angle bracket|j}}.  The spelling of the glottal stop with an apostrophe-like character most likely originates from transliterations of the Arabic [[hamza]]. It has also been spelled with a grave accent over the preceding vowel in some Nahuatl works, following [[Horacio Carochi]] (1645).

The saltillo represents a [[phoneme]] in many other [[indigenous languages of the Americas]] and so its presence or absence can change the meaning of a word. However, there is no saltillo in Standard Spanish, so the sound is often imperceptible to Spanish-speakers, and Spanish writers usually did not write it when transcribing Mexican languages: Nahuatl {{IPA-nah|ˈtɬeko|}} "in a fire" and {{IPA|[ˈtɬeʔko]}} "he ascends" were both written ''tleco''.

The saltillo symbol is also being used in at least one Southeast Asian language, Central Sinama of the Philippines and Malaysia. It represents both the glottal stop and the centralized vowel {{IPAblink|ə}}.

This letter corresponds to two code points in Unicode, starting in [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA720.pdf Unicode 5.1]: {{unichar|a78b|LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SALTILLO|html=}} and {{unichar|A78C|LATIN SMALL LETTER SALTILLO|html=}}. They are normally rendered as a straight [[apostrophe]]-like symbol, sometimes described as a dotless exclamation point. In earlier versions of Unicode, saltillo was provisionally represented by such characters as {{unichar|02BC|MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE|nlink=Modifier letter apostrophe}}. Typists who are unfamiliar with Unicode frequently use an apostrophe instead, but that can cause problems in computers because apostrophe is a punctuation mark, not a word-building character, and the ambiguous use of apostrophe for two different functions can make automated processing of the text difficult. The Unicode character for saltillo is not included{{when|date=April 2016}} in the Unicode packages found in mobile phones, which also makes typists required to revert to the apostrophe to avoid display issues for mobile users.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4172">{{Semiotics}}
'''Semiotic literary criticism''', also called '''literary semiotics''', is the approach to [[literary criticism]] informed by the theory of signs or [[semiotics]]. Semiotics, tied closely to the [[structuralism]] pioneered by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], was extremely influential in the development of [[literary theory]] out of the formalist approaches of the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/S4B/sem11.html|title=Semiotics for Beginners: Criticisms|website=visual-memory.co.uk|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The early forms of literary semiotics grew out of formalist approaches to literature, especially [[Russian formalism]], and structuralist linguistics, especially the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague school]].  Notable early semiotic authors included [[Vladimir Propp]], [[Algirdas Julius Greimas]], and [[Viktor Shklovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ruc.udc.es/dspace/bitstream/handle/2183/13421/CC-130_art_129.pdf?sequence=1|title=Peirce’s Semiotics and the Russian Formalism: Points of Convergence|last=Kiryushchenko|first=Vitaly|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics were concerned with a formal analysis of narrative forms which would resemble a literary mathematics, or at least a literary [[syntax]], as far as possible.  They proposed various formal notations for narrative components and transformations and attempted a descriptive taxonomy of existing stories along these lines.

Propp's ''Morphology of the Folktale'' (orig. Russian pub. 1928; English trans. 1958) provides an example of the formal and systematic approach.  In successive chapters, Propp analyzes the characters, plot events, and other elements of traditional folktales (primarily from Russia and Eastern Europe).  For each of these key components he provides a letter designation (with superscripts to designate specific subtypes).  He proceeds to analyze individual tales by transposing them into this notation and then to generalize about their structure.  For example:

: Analysis of a simple, single-move tale of class H-I, of the type: kidnapping of a person.
:: 131. A tsar, three daughters (α).  The daughters go walking (β³), overstay in the garden (δ¹).  A dragon kidnaps them (A¹).  A call for aid (B¹).  Quest of three heroes (C↑).  Three battles with the dragon (H¹–I¹), rescue of the maidens (K&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;).  Return (↓), reward (w°). (Propp 128)

He then gives the complete structure of this story in one line of notation, the analysis complete and ready to be compared systematically with other tales:

::: αβ³δ¹A¹B¹C↑H¹–I¹K&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;↓w°

Later semiotic approaches to literature have often been less systematic (or, in some special cases such as [[Roland Barthes]]'s ''[[S/Z]]'', they have been so specifically and exhaustively systematic as to render the possibility of a complete literary semiotics doubtful).  As structuralist linguistics gave way to a [[post-structuralist]] philosophy of language which denied the scientific ambitions of the general theory of signs, semiotic literary criticism became more playful and less systematic in its ambitions.  Still, some authors harbor more scientific ambition for their literary schemata than others.  Later authors in the semiotic tradition of literary criticism include [[Tzvetan Todorov]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Michael Riffaterre]], and [[Umberto Eco]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39392">{{Linguistic typology topics}}
In [[linguistic typology]], a '''subject–object–verb''' ('''SOV''') language is one in which the [[subject (grammar)|subject]], [[object (grammar)|object]], and [[verb]] of a sentence always or usually appear in that order. If [[English language|English]] were SOV, "Sam oranges ate" would be an ordinary sentence, as opposed to the actual [[Standard English]] "Sam ate oranges".

The term is often loosely used for [[ergative language]]s like [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] and [[Basque language|Basque]] that really have [[agent (grammar)|agents]] instead of subjects.

==Incidence==
{{Language word order frequency}}
Among [[natural language]]s with a word order preference, SOV is the most common type (followed by [[subject–verb–object]]; the two types account for more than 75% of natural languages with a preferred order).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Crystal | first = David | authorlink = David Crystal | title = The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language | edition = 2nd | year = 1997 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | isbn = 0-521-55967-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Languages that have SOV structure include [[Ainu language|Ainu]], [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], [[Amharic language|Amharic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Burushaski language|Burushaski]], [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]], [[Dakota language|Dakota]], [[Dogon languages]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], [[Ancient Greek]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hajong language|Hajong]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Hittite language|Hittite]], [[Hopi language|Hopi]], [[Ijoid languages]], [[Itelmen language|Itelmen]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Latin language|Classical Latin]], [[Lakota language|Lakota]], [[Manchu language|Manchu]], [[Mande languages]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Navajo language|Navajo]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Nepal Bhasa|Newari]], [[Nivkh language|Nivkh]], [[Nobiin language|Nobiin]], [[Pāli]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Senufo languages]], [[Seri language|Seri]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]], [[Sunwar language|Sunuwar]] and most other [[Indo-Iranian languages]], [[Somali language|Somali]] and virtually all other [[Cushitic languages]], [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] and nearly all other [[Tibeto-Burman languages]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu Language|Telugu]] and all other [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] languages, [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], [[Turkic languages]], [[Turkish Language|Turkish]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], almost all [[Uto-Aztecan languages]], [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Yukaghir language|Yukaghir]], and virtually all [[Caucasian languages]].

[[Standard Chinese|Standard Mandarin]] is SVO, but for simple sentences with a clear context, word order is flexible enough to allow for SOV or OSV. [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] are considered SVO in conventional typology and SOV in [[generative grammar]]. For example, in German, a basic sentence such as "Ich sage etwas über Karl" ("I say something about Karl") is in SVO word order. When a noun clause marker like "dass" or "wer" (in English, "that" or "who" respectively) is used, the verb appears at the end of the sentence for the word order SOV. A possible example in SOV word order would be "Ich sage, dass Karl einen Gürtel gekauft hat." (A literal English translation would be "I say that Karl a belt bought has.") This is [[V2 word order]].

A rare example of SOV word order in English is "I (subject) thee (object) wed (verb)" in the wedding vow "With this ring, I thee wed."&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Fischer, "'With this ring I thee wed': The verbs to wed and to marry in the history of English". Language History and Linguistic Modelling: A Festschrift for Jacek Fisiak on his 60th Birthday. Ed. Raymond Hickey and Stanislaw Puppel. Trends in Linguistics, Studies and Monographs 101 (Berlin, New York: Mouton de Gruyter, 1997), pp.467-81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
SOV languages have a strong tendency to use [[postposition]]s rather than [[preposition]]s, to place [[auxiliary verb]]s after the action verb, to place [[genitive]] noun phrases before the possessed noun, to place a name before a title or [[honorific]] ("James Uncle" and "Johnson Doctor" rather than "Uncle James" and "Doctor Johnson") and to have subordinators appear at the end of subordinate clauses. They have a weaker but significant tendency to place [[demonstrative]] adjectives before the nouns they modify. [[Relative clause]]s preceding the nouns to which they refer usually signals SOV word order, but the reverse does not hold: SOV languages feature prenominal and postnominal relative clauses roughly equally. SOV languages also seem to exhibit a tendency towards using a [[time–manner–place]] ordering of [[adpositional phrase]]s.

In linguistic typology one can usefully distinguish two types of SOV languages in terms of their type of marking:

# [[dependent-marking language|dependent-marking]] has [[case (linguistics)|case]] [[marker (linguistics)|markers]] to distinguish the subject and the object, which allows it to use the variant OSV word order without ambiguity. This type usually places [[adjective]]s and [[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s before the nouns they modify and is exclusively suffixing without prefixes. SOV languages of this first type include [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]].
# [[head-marking language|head-marking]] distinguishes subject and object by [[affix]]es on the verb rather than markers on the nouns. It also differs from the dependent-marking SOV language in using [[prefix]]es as well as suffixes, usually for [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[possession (linguistics)|possession]]. Because adjectives in this type are much more verb-like than in dependent-marking SOV languages, they usually follow the nouns. In most SOV languages with a significant level of head-marking or verb-like adjectives, numerals and related quantifiers (like "all", "every") also follow the nouns they modify. Languages of this type include [[Navajo language|Navajo]] and [[Seri language|Seri]].

In practice, of course, the distinction between these two types is far from sharp. Many SOV languages are substantially [[double-marking language|double-marking]] and tend to exhibit properties intermediate between the two idealised types above.

Many languages that have shifted to SVO-word order from the original SOV retain (at least to an extent) the properties, for example the Finnish language (high usage of postpositions etc.)

=== Chinese ===
Generally, [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] all feature SVO word order. However, especially in [[Standard Chinese|Standard Mandarin]], SOV is tolerated as well. There is even a special structure to form an SOV sentence.

Note that SOV is generally used to emphasize the object, such as in this case, where the apple is a very specific apple.

SOV structure is also widely used in railway contact in order to clarify the objective of the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|title=车机联控语言——铁路行车领域“共同语言”的研究|url=https://wenku.baidu.com/view/832c1d110b4e767f5acfce6d.html|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, in [[Standard Chinese|Standard Mandarin]], SOV is used in the passive voice, where the object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence, and the subject of the active sentence becomes the object of the passive sentence.

=== Dutch ===
[[Dutch language|Dutch]] is SOV combined with [[V2 word order]]. The non-finite verb (infinitive or participle) remains in final position, but the finite (i.e. inflected) verb is moved to the second position. Simple verbs look like [[subject–verb–object|SVO]], non-finite verbs (participles, infinitives) and compound verbs follow this pattern:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
! Sentence
| colspan="5" style="text-align:left" | Ik wil je helpen.
|-
! Parts
| Ik || wil || je || helpen
|-
! Gloss
| I || want to || you || help
|-
! Parts
| subject || fin.verb || object || nonfin.verb
|-
! Translation
| colspan="5" style="text-align:left" | I want to help you.
|}

Pure SOV order is found in subordinate clauses:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
! Sentence
| colspan="7" style="text-align:left" | Ik zei dat ik je wil helpen.
|-
! Parts
| Ik || zei || dat || ik || je || wil || helpen
|-
! Gloss
| I || said || that || I || you || want || to help
|-

| subject || fin.verb || subord. conj. || subject || object || fin.verb || nonfin.verb
|-
! Translation
| colspan="7" style="text-align:left" | I said that I want to help you.
|}

=== French ===
The [[French language]] usually uses a subject–verb–object structure but places [[Clitic|proclitics]] before the verb when using most pronouns, which is sometimes mistaken for SOV word order.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"

=== Georgian ===
The [[Georgian language]] isn't extremely rigid with regards to word order, but is typically either SOV or SVO.

=== German ===
[[German language|German]] is SOV combined with [[V2 word order]]. The non-finite verb (infinitive or participle) remains in final position, but the finite (i.e. inflected) verb is moved to the second position. Simple verbs look like [[subject–verb–object|SVO]], compound verbs follow this pattern:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-

| He || has ||an apple || eaten.
|-
! Parts
| Subject || Auxiliary || Object || Verb
|-
! Translation
| colspan="5" style="text-align:left" | He has eaten an apple.
|}

The word order changes also depending on whether the phrase is a [[main clause]] or a [[dependent clause]]. In dependent clauses, the word order is always entirely SOV (cf. also [[Inversion (linguistics)|Inversion]]):

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-

The markers が (ga) and を ((w)o) are, respectively, subject and object markers for the words that precede them. Technically, the sentence could be translated a number of ways ("'''I''' open a box", "It is I who open the boxes", etc.), but this does not affect the SOV analysis.

Japanese has some flexibility in word order, so an OSV is also possible. ('''箱'''を'''私'''が'''開け'''ます。)

=== Kashmiri ===
Like German and Dutch the Indo-Aryan language [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] is SOV combined with [[V2 word order]]. The non-finite verb (infinitive or participle) remains in final position, but the finite (i.e. inflected) part of the verb appears in second position. Simple verbs look like [[subject–verb–object|SVO]], whereas auxiliated verbs are discontinuous and adhere to this pattern:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
! Sentence
| colspan="6" style="text-align:left" | کور چہے ثونٹہ کہیوان
|-
! Transcription
| kuur || chhi || tsũũţh  || khyevaan
|-
! Gloss
| girl || is || apples || eating
|-
! Parts
| Subject || Auxiliary || Object || Verb
|-
! Translation
| colspan="6" style="text-align:left" | The girl is eating apples.
|}

Since Kashmiri is a [[V2 word order|V2 language]] if the word ''tsũũţh'' 'apple' comes first then the subject ''kuur'' 'girl' must follow the auxiliary ''chhi'' 'is': ''tsũũţh chhi kuur khyevaan'' [Lit. "Apples is girl eating."]

The word order changes also depending on whether the phrase is in a [[main clause]] or in certain kinds of [[dependent clause]]. For instance, in '''[[relative clauses]]''', the word order is SOVAux:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
! Main clause + Subordinate Clause
| colspan="9" style="text-align:left" | میے ان سوہ کور '''یوس ثونٹہ کہیوان چہے '''

'가 (ga)/이 (i)' is a particle that indicates the nominative case. '를 (reul)/을 (eul)' is a particle that indicates the accusative case. '-ㄴ다 (nda)' indicates present tense declarative.  The consonant 'ㄹ (l)' in the verb stem (열-) is dropped before the suffix.

※ Here, '나 (na, [[I (pronoun)]])' is changed to '내 (nae)' before '가 (ga)'.

=== Latin ===
{{main|Latin word order}}
[[Classical Latin]] was an [[inflected language]] and had a very flexible word order and sentence structure, but the most usual word order in formal prose was SOV.

=== Portuguese ===
[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is an SVO language, but it has some SOV constructs.

In case of [[Portuguese_personal_pronouns#Proclisis.2C_enclisis.2C_and_mesoclisis|proclisis]]:

''Todos aqui te amam''. Literally: ''Everybody here loves you''.

''Aquilo me entristeceu''. Literally: ''It saddened me''.

When using a temporal adverb, optionally with the negative:

''Nós já [não] os temos''. Literally: ''We already [not] them have''. Meaning: (Positive) ''We already have them''. (Negative) ''We do not have them anymore.''

''Nós ainda [não] os temos''. Literally: ''We still [not] them have''. Meaning: (Positive) ''We still have them''. (Negative) ''We have do not them yet.''.

When answering the phone:
''Sim, sou eu''. Literally: ''Yes, am I''.  Meaning: ''Yes, it's I''

SVO form: ''Sou eu mesmo/mesma'', literally "It's me [indeed]".

There is an [[infix]] construction for the [[Future tense|future]] and [[Conditional tense|conditional]] tenses:

''Eu fá-lo-ei amanhã''. Literally: ''I do-it-will tomorrow''. Meaning: ''I will do it tomorrow''.

SVO form: ''Eu hei-de fazê-lo amanhã'' or ''eu farei o mesmo amanhã''

On composed sentences, it is also allowed the SOV order for the last part in some situations like:

''Ela não os comeu, mas comi-os eu''. Literally: ''She did not eat them, but ate them I''. Meaning: ''She did not eat them, but I did''.

SVO form: ''Ela não comeu os mesmos, mas eu comi [a eles]''.

=== Russian ===
[[Russian language|Russian]] is an [[inflected language]] and very flexible in word order; it allows all possible word combinations. However, it is generally considered a SVO language.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! Sentence
| colspan="6" style="text-align:center" | Она его любит

| she (nom) || him (acc) || loves
|-
! Parts
| Subject || Object || Verb
|-
! Translation
| colspan="3" style="text-align:left" | She loves him
|}

for example: Она любит его, любит его oна, любит oна его, and virtually all re-orderings of Russian sentence order are correct although this is often used in different situations to emphasize particular constituents of a sentence. Who loves him? 'she' is the one who loves him (emphatic meaning). In this way any part of the sentence can be emphasized without changing basic meaning (a convenience created by Russian's noun case system)

=== Sanskrit ===
[[Saṃskṛtam]] is an inflected language and very flexible in word order; it allows all possible word combinations. However, it is generally considered a SOV language.

=== Spanish ===
The [[Spanish language]] usually uses a subject–verb–object structure, but when an enclitic pronoun is used, this comes before the verb and the auxiliary. Sometimes, in dual-verb constructions involving the infinitive and the gerund, the enclitic pronoun can be put before both verbs, or attached to the end of the second verb.

| colspan="2" | Subject
| colspan="2" | Object
| Verb
|-
! Translation
| colspan="5" style="text-align:left" |  I (am the one who) open(s) the box.
|}
The தான் (tān) and யை (yai) are, respectively, nominative and accusative markers for the subject and object that respectively precede them. The தான் (tān) is optional in the [[Tamil language]]. The sentence may literally be translated as 'I [who am] the box [which] open shall.'

The sentence may also be translated, although less frequently, as பெட்டியை நான் தான் திறப்பேன் (Peṭṭiyai nāṉ tāṉ tiṟappēn), or simply, பெட்டியை திறப்பேன் (Peṭṭiyai tiṟappēn) as Tamil is a null-subject language because the indicative verb at the end of the word indicates the 1st person subject. This follows the object-subject-verb (OSV) pattern.

=== Tigrinya ===
The [[Tigrinya language]] usually uses a subject–verb–object structure.

|-

| Joseph || the apple || ate
|-
! Parts
| Subject
| Object
| colspan="2" | Verb
|-
! Translation
| colspan="5" style="text-align:left" | Joseph ate the apple.
|}

Like all other [[Turkic languages]], Turkish has flexibility in word order, so any order is possible. For example, in addition to the SOV order above, this sentence could also be constructed as OSV (''Elmayı Yusuf yedi.''), OVS (''Elmayı yedi Yusuf.''), VSO (''Yedi Yusuf elmayı.''), VOS (''Yedi elmayı Yusuf.''), or SVO (''Yusuf yedi elmayı.''), but these other orders carry a connotation of emphasis of importance on either the subject, object, or the verb. The SOV order is the "default" one that does not connote particular emphasis on any part of the sentence.

! Translation
| colspan="5" style="text-align:left" |  Anvar went to Khiva.
|}
The marker "ga" is a dative case marker for the object that precedes it. 
Due to flexibility in word order in [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], it is possible to transform the sentence into OSV as well ("Xivaga Anvar ketdi" / "It was Anvar who went to Khiva").

The '''Timoric''', or sometimes '''Timor–Babar''', languages are a group of fifty [[Austronesian languages]] (geographically [[Central–Eastern Malayo-Polynesian languages]]) spoken on the islands of [[Timor]], neighboring [[Wetar Island|Wetar]], and (depending on the classification) the [[Babar Islands]] to the east.

Within the group, the languages with the most speakers are [[Uab Meto]] of [[West Timor]] and [[Tetum]] of [[East Timor]], each with about half a million speakers, though in addition Tetum is an official language and a lingua franca among non-Tetum East Timorese.

==Languages==
Unclassified [[Nauete language|Nauete]] is not close to other Timorese languages.  [[Habu language|Habu]] is structurally similar to [[Waima'a language|Waima'a]].

The Babar languages form their own group:
* [[Babar languages]] (see)

===Hull (1998)===
[[Geoffrey Hull]] (1998) proposes a Timoric group as follows:

*Ramelaic (near the [[Ramelau]] range)
**West: [[Kemak language|Kemak]], [[Tukudede language|Tukudede]]
**Central: [[Mambai language (Timor)|Mambai]]
**East (Idalaka): [[Idaté language|Idaté]], [[Isní language|Isní]], [[Lakalei language|Lakalei]], [[Lolein language|Lolein]]
*Extra-Ramelaic (Fabronic; whatever is not Ramelaic)
**West: [[Dawan language|Dawan]] (Uab Meto)–[[Amarasi language|Amarasi]], [[Helong language|Helong]], Roti ([[Bilba language|Bilba]], [[Dengka language|Dengka]], [[Lole language|Lole]], [[Ringgou language|Ringgou]], [[Dela-Oenale language|Dela-Oenale]], [[Termanu language|Termanu]], [[Tii language|Tii]])
**Central: [[Tetun language|Tetun]], [[Bekais language|Bekais]]
**North: [[Wetar language|Wetar]], [[Galoli language|Galoli]]
**East: [[Kairui language|Kairui]], [[Waimoa language|Waimaha]], [[Midiki language|Midiki]]; [[Luang language|Luang]], [[Makuva language|Makuva]]

===Van Engelenhoven ===
Van Engelenhoven sets up a South–East Timor branch including Tetun, Waimaha, and Luangic–Kisaric; the latter is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Adelaar 2005:26&lt;/ref&gt;

*South–East Timor
** Tetun

The '''Vanji language''', also spelt '''Vanchi''' and '''Vanži''', is an extinct [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] language, one of the [[Sprachbund|areal]] group of [[Pamir languages]]. It was spoken in the [[Vanj River]] valley in what is now the [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region]] of [[Tajikistan]].

In the 19th century the region was forcibly annexed to the [[Bukharan Emirate]] and a campaign of violent assimilation undertaken, and by the end of the 19th century, the Vanji language had completely disappeared, displaced by [[Tajik language|Tajik Persian]] as a result of assimilation.

==Documentation==
The Russian linguist [[Ivan Ivanovich Zarubin]] was the first to assess the language in the early 20th Century, by which time it was already extinct. Zarubin was able to collect only words and phrases recalled by older inhabitants of the region as having been spoken by their grandparents who still knew something of the language and he considered it one of the Pamir languages.&lt;ref&gt;Zarubin, I. ''К списку Памирских языков'' in Doklady Rossiiskoi Akademii Nauk, 1924 B pp. 79-81; quoted in ''Problem of Archaism and Innovation in the Eastern Iranian Languages'', Ľubomír Novák, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

B, ''Старованджский язык'', Moscow (2008), quoted in ''Problem of Archaism and Innovation in the Eastern Iranian Languages'', Ľubomír Novák, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; had a phonology consisting of the [[stop consonant]]s p, b, t, d, k, g and q, the [[fricative consonant]]s f, v, θ, ð, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, x, ɣ, χ, ʁ and h, the [[affricate consonant]]s t͡ʃ and d͡ʒ and the [[sonorant]]s m, w, n, r, l, j and ŋ as well as the vowels a, e, ẹ, i, ə, o, ü and u. Much less can be discerned about the grammar of Vanji: there were probably two [[gender (grammar)|genders]], masculine and feminine, with plurals of nouns formed by adding a suffix ''-ev'', [[Comparison (grammar)|comparative]] forms of adjectives by adding ''-tar'' and [[Infinitive]]s of verbs were formed by adding ''-ak''.

'''Wahgi''' is a [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans–New Guinea language]] of the [[Chimbu–Wahgi languages|Chimbu–Wahgi branch]] spoken by approximately 100,000 people in the highlands of [[Papua New Guinea]]. Like other [[Chimbu languages]], Wahgi has some unusual [[lateral consonant]]s.

The dental consonants are "distributed", with closure along a considerable distance of the vocal tract. This presumably means that they are [[laminal consonant|laminal]], and that the alveolar consonants are [[apical consonant|apical]]. The dental consonants have palatalized allophones in free variation.

The description of the (palatalized) dentals suggest they may be [[alveolo-palatal]] or something similar. This is further suggested by transitional vowels triggered by {{IPA|/ɬ̪/}}, apparently even by its non-palatalized allophone: {{IPA|/oɬ̪/ [oɪ̯ɬ̪]}} 'moon', {{IPA|/ˈéɬ̪é/ [ˈéɬ̪ɪ̯è]}} [sic] 'here'.

The nasal element of the prenasalized consonants is syllabic when not preceded by a vowel, but takes a noncontrastive low tone and is never stressed: {{IPA|/ˈmbà/ [m̩̀ˈba]}} 'but', {{IPA|/ˈpɪ̀ɬ̪mbé/ [ˈpɪ̀ɬ̪m̩̄bé]}} 'we know'. Prenasalized consonants are perceived as single segments word-initially, but as nasal + stop word-medially.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 1976: 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasals and semivowels have no notable allophony, apart from the optional palatalization of {{IPA|/n̪/}}. The other consonants vary markedly, with most variants being positional:

The southern Kuma dialect has these three laterals, though the alveolar is rather uncommon. (The northern Danga dialect has two laterals, dental fricative and alveolar flap.) The dental and velar laterals assimilate to {{IPA|[ɬ]}} or {{IPA|[ɬ̪]}} before dental and alveolar consonants; the alveolar only to {{IPA|[ɬ]}} before alveolar consonants. In locational forms with a suffix beginning with /t/, the /t/ is elided following the lateral, so that on the surface Wahgi distinguishes dental vs alveolar lateral fricatives and alveolar lateral fricatives vs flaps.

===Vowels===

| {{IPA|e}}
| {{IPA|ä}} 
|}

:{{IPA|/a/}} appears as {{IPA|[ä]}} in all positions except before /k/ and /p/, where it is {{IPA|[ɐ]}}. In medial position it is in occasional free variation with {{IPA|[æ]}}. 
:{{IPA|/ɔ/}} appears as {{IPA|[ɔ]}} in all positions except before nasals, where it is {{IPA|[ɒ]}}. Word-finally it is in free variation with {{IPA|[o]}}. 
:{{IPA|/u/}} is reduced to labialization ({{IPA|[ʷ]}}) between {{IPA|/p t s k ng/}} and stressed {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/ɪ/}}.

All vowels neutralize to {{IPA|[ɪ̈]}} in final unstressed closed syllables (disregarding subsequent "clitics").

In rapid speech, unstressed {{IPA|/u, ɪ, e/}} elide between stressed syllables. For example, in rapid speech {{IPA|/ˈpetepˈka/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈpeɾpˈka]}}.

===Tone and stress===
Wahgi appears to have three [[word tone]]s rather than phonemic tone on each syllable. At least one syllable will have a phonetic high tone, with the resulting patterns of high, rising and falling on words of one or two syllables, and peaking, rising and falling on words of three to five syllables. Stress also appears to be contrastive, but analysis is difficult.

On both monosyllabic and disyllabic words, the three tones are realized as high, rising and falling: [HH], [LH] and [HL]. An analysis of two phonemic syllable tones, HIGH and LOW, is complicated by the appearance of all three word tones on monosyllables with final occlusive codas (and phonetically short vowels).&lt;ref&gt;Monosyllables with falling tone are transcribed with low tone in Phillips 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

In polysyllabic words, 
*HIGH (H) is phonetically high, optionally extra high on stressed syllables. 
*LOW (L) is phonetically falling on unstressed syllables at the end of a prosodic phrase. It is phonetically mid between a high tone and another low tone (i.e. the sequence /HLL/ is [HML] and /LLH/ is [LMH]). It is phonetically low elsewhere.

On trisyllables, the patterns LHL, HLL, and LLH are attested. On tetrasyllables are LLHL, LLLH, and LHHL (that is, LMHL, LLMH, LHHL). On pentasyllables, only two patterns have been found, LLHHH and LLHHL (that is, LMHHH and LMHHL).

Words with six to nine syllables are only attested with a single pattern, a peaking tone (LHL) on the first three syllables followed by a falling tone (LH) stretched out over the remaining syllables. For words of six syllables, this is realized as LHLHLL (phonetically LHLHML); for seven, LHLHLLL; for eight, LHLHHLLL; for nine LHLHHLLLL. In each case, the second syllable (the first high tone) is also stressed, and it is not clear if these are actually double-peaking tones or single peaking tones with preceding stress. Regardless, there does not appear to be any phonemic distinction.

===Phonotactics===
The maximal syllable in Wahgi is CVCC; the minimal syllable is V, which may be any vowel but {{IPA|/ɪ/}}. Any consonant may occur in the onset except the three laterals. Any consonant may occur in the coda except the semivowels and /ng/. With a coda consonant cluster, the first consonant may only be {{IPA|/p, t, k, l̪, ʟ/}} (the two common laterals) and the second may only be {{IPA|/m, s/}}.

A word may be anywhere from one to nine syllables long. A monosyllabic word may be any type of syllable but V and maybe CV. (Phonetic length and perhaps tone distribution suggests that words transcribed as CV monosyllables may actually be CVV with identical vowels.) Beside the syllable-onset and -coda restrictions, {{IPA|/i, ɪ/}} may not occur word-initially and {{IPA|/ɪ/}} may not occur word-finally.

Observed vowel clusters within words are {{IPA|/i.a, i.o, i.u; ɪ.i, ɪ.o; e.i, e.o, e.u; a.i, a.ɪ, a.e, a.a, a.u; o.i, o.o; u.i, u.ɪ, u.a, u.o, u.u/}}. In some cases (such as {{IPA|/ɪ.i/}}) these sequences reduce across morpheme boundaries, and stress seems to play a role in vowel reduction. It may be that some of the difficulties in analyzing stress may be a conflation of vowel sequences across syllables with sequences in single heavy (bimoraic CVV) syllables.

Observed consonant clusters within words are those allowed as syllable codas, {{IPA|/ps, pm, tm, ks, km, l̪s, l̪m, ʟm/}}, plus {{IPA|/p.p, p.t, p.nz; mb.p, mb.t, mb.m; t.p, t.mb, t.nd, t.n̪, t.n, t.ŋ; nd.p, nd.m; k.p; s.p, s.mb, s.nd, s.k, s.nz, s.m, s.n; nz.p, nz.m; m.p, m.nz, m.m, m.ŋ; n̪.p, n̪.m; n.p, n.m, n.ŋ; ŋ.p, ŋ.mb, ŋ.s, ŋ.nz, ŋ.m, ŋ.n; l̪.p, l̪.mb, l̪.t, l̪.k, l̪ [sic], l̪.w; l.mb, l.nd; ʟ.p, ʟ.mb, ʟ.t, ʟ.nz, ʟ.n, ʟ.ŋ, ʟ.w/}}.

In rapid speech, the following additional combinations are known: {{IPA|/ks.mp, ks.n, ks.m, ps.nd, lm.ŋ, tm.ŋ/}}.

'''Weight on bit'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/oilandgas/glossary_of_terms/glossary_of_terms_w.html&lt;/ref&gt; (WOB), as expressed in the [[oil industry]], is the amount of downward force exerted on the [[Drill bit#Well drilling bits|drill bit]] and is normally measured in thousands of pounds.

Weight on bit is provided by drill collars, which are thick-walled tubular pieces machined from solid bars of steel, usually plain carbon steel but sometimes of nonmagnetic nickel-copper alloy or other nonmagnetic premium alloys. Gravity acts on the large mass of the collars to provide the downward force needed for the bits to efficiently break rock. To accurately control the amount of force applied to the bit, the driller carefully monitors the surface weight measured while the bit is just off the bottom of the wellbore. Next, the drillstring (and the drill bit), is slowly and carefully lowered until it touches bottom. After that point, as the driller continues to lower the top of the drillstring, more and more weight is applied to the bit, and correspondingly less weight is measured as hanging at the surface. If the surface measurement shows 20,000 pounds [9080&amp;nbsp;kg] less weight than with the bit off bottom, then there should be 20,000 pounds force on the bit (in a vertical hole). Some downhole MWD sensors can measure weight-on-bit more accurately and transmit the data to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=drill%20collar&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yakub Kolas''' (also '''Jakub Kołas''', {{lang-be|Яку́б Ко́лас}}, {{OldStyleDate|November 3|1882|October 22}} – August 13, 1956), real name Kanstancin Mickievič (Міцке́віч Канстанці́н Міха́йлавіч) was a Belarusian writer, People's Poet of the [[Byelorussian SSR]] (1926), and member (1928) and vice-president (from 1929) of the [[Belarusian Academy of Sciences]].

In his works, Yakub Kolas was known for his sympathy towards the ordinary Belarusian peasantry. This was evident in his pen name 'Kolas', meaning 'ear of grain' in Belarusian. He wrote collections of poems ''Songs of Captivity''
&lt;!-- in Russian, ''Песни неволи''--&gt;
(1908) and ''Songs of Grief'' ({{lang-be|Песьні-жальбы}}, 1910), poems ''A New Land'' ({{lang-be|Новая зямля}}, 1923) and ''Simon the Musician'' ({{lang-be|Сымон-музыка}}, 1925), stories, and plays.  His poem ''The Fisherman's Hut'' ({{lang-be|Рыбакова хата}}, 1947) is about the fight after unification of Belarus with the Soviet state. His trilogy ''At a Crossroads''
&lt;!-- in Russian, ''На перепутье''--&gt;
(1954) is about the pre-Revolutionary life of the Belarusian peasantry and the democratic intelligentsia. He was awarded the [[Stalin Prize]] in 1946 and 1949.
In honor of Yakub Kolas, a [[Yakub Kolas Square|square]] and a [[Yakub Kolas Street|street]] in the center of [[Minsk]] bear his name.

The expression '''Zone to Defend''' or ''ZAD'' (French: ''zone à défendre'') is a French neologism used to refer to a militant [[Occupy movement|occupation]] that is intended to physically blockade a development project. The ZADs are organized particularly in areas with an ecological or agricultural dimension,&lt;ref&gt;[http://reporterre.net/Une-ZAD-voit-le-jour-au-milieu-des] "A ZAD born in the fields near Agen", Reporterre, December 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; notably in the permanent blockade village against [[Aéroport du Grand Ouest|an airport in Notre-Dame-des-Landes]]. However the name has also been used by occupations in urban areas, e.g.: in Rouen,&lt;ref&gt;[http://reporterre.net/Une-journee-sur-la-Zad-urbaine-de] "A day on urban Zad Rouen - evicted Friday morning", Reporterre, 7 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; in Décines-Charpieu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reporterre.net/A-Lyon-expulsion-de-la-premiere]"In Lyon, the first expulsion ZAD ... but the second still resists", Reporterre, January 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; One of the movement's first slogans was "ZADs everywhere" and though there are no official figures, in early 2016 there were estimated to have been between 10 and 15 ZADs across France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lagazettedescommunes.com/427131/zones-a-defendre-les-amenageurs-face-a-une-nouvelle-contrainte/#fn-427131-1]"Zones to Defend: developers face a new constraint", www.lagazettedescommunes.com, 3 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The acronym "ZAD" is a [[détournement]] of "deferred development area" (from French: "zone d'aménagement différé").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2015/02/07/01016-20150207ARTFIG00061-comment-le-mot-zadiste-s-est-integre-dans-le-langage-courant.php] "How the word "Zadist" was built in the current language", Le Figaro, 7 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the French term ''"zadiste"'' (English: Zadist) entered the 2016 edition of ''Le Petit Robert'' dictionary as "a militant occupying a ZAD to oppose a proposed development that would damage the environment."&lt;ref&gt;Le Petit Robert 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Appearing in France in the early 2010s, the term was first popularized during the opposition to the airport construction project in Notre-Dame-des-Landes, north of Nantes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=1237593&amp;xtmc=zad&amp;xtcr=10] "The country slingshots against the "unnecessary" projects", Le Monde, 30 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The ZAD movement has its origins in challenging large infrastructure projects in defense of the environment, local people's right to decide the future of their territories (at the price, if necessary, of conflict with state power) and the rejection of the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] economy. In France, the most famous antecedents of the ZAD movement are the [[Fight for the Larzac|Larzac struggle]] (1971-1981),&lt;ref&gt;[http://rue89.nouvelobs.com/rue89-planete/2012/11/17/notre-dame-des-landes-nest-pas-le-larzac-meme-si-ca-y-ressemble-237113] "Notre-Dame-des-Landes is not the Larzac (even if it looks like)", Rue89, 17 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the protests against the proposed nuclear power plant at Creys-Malville, in Isère (1977), and at Plogoff in the 70s and 80s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20130729.OBS1397/notre-dame-des-landes-reve-d-une-issue-a-la-plogoff.html] "Notre-Dame-des-Landes dream of a solution to the Plogoff", L'OBS, 3 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The ZADs have multiplied in France after the failed eviction of the Notre-Dame-des-Landes commune in the autumn of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2015/10/24/d-une-zad-a-l-autre-tour-d-horizon-des-conflits-environnementaux_4796121_3244.html] "In ZAD to another overview of environmental conflicts", 24 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first to be set up after the failure of the eviction of the ZAD was the ZAD Bouillons farm, near Rouen, occupied against a real estate project by the group Auchan beginning in the winter of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2013/05/10/un-squat-contre-un-projet-de-zone-commerciale-pres-de-rouen_3175328_3244.html] "The militants of Notre-Dame-des-Landes are trying to spread their movement", 10 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Notre-Dame-des-Landes ZAD, the best-known cases are those of the opposition to the [[Sivens Dam|Sivens dam]] project in the Tarn where the activist [[Rémi Fraisse]] was killed by the French police&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2018/01/09/mort-de-remi-fraisse-a-sivens-les-juges-ordonnent-un-non-lieu_5239406_1653578.html&lt;/ref&gt;, at the Center Parks of the forest of Chambaran in Isère, and more recently against project Cigeo in Bure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la-croix.com/Archives/2013-08-02/Notre-Dame-des-Landes-inspire-d-autres-protestations.-2013-08-02-994261] "Notre-Dame-des-Landes inspired other protests", The Cross, 2 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
