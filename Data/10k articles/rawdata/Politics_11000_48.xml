Protest activity against the Vietnam War took place prior to and during the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]].

In 1967, [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] and [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War]] protest groups had been promising to come to [[Chicago]] and disrupt the convention, and the city promised to maintain law and order. For eight days the protesters were met by the [[Chicago Police Department]] in the streets and parks of Chicago while the [[U.S. Democratic Party]] met at the convention in the [[International Amphitheater]], with the protests climaxing in what a major report later said was a "police riot" on the night of August 28, 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/08/24/a-party-that-had-lost-its-mind-in-1968-democrats-held-one-of-historys-most-disastrous-conventions/?utm_term=.1dbe5c1c4fd9|title=‘A party that had lost its mind’: In 1968, Democrats held one of history’s most disastrous conventions|last=|first=|date=August 24, 2018|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth International Party's involvement==
{{wikisource|Yippie Workshop Speech}}
[[File:Yippie! Button at the Chicago History Museum.jpg|thumb|right|200px|a Yippie! button on display at the [[Chicago History Museum]]]]
The [[Youth International Party]] was one of the major groups in the organization of the protests. [[Abbie Hoffman]], [[Jerry Rubin]], and a few friends engaged in conversation at Hoffman's apartment on [[New Year's Eve]], 1967. They discussed the events of the year, such as the [[Summer of Love]] and [[the Pentagon]] demonstration. The idea of having a free music festival in Chicago was suggested to defuse political tension.{{who|date=June 2013}} Over the next week, the Youth International Party (known as Yippie) took shape. Yippie politicized [[hippie]] ideology and used [[Street theatre|street theater]] and other tactics to critique the [[culture of the United States]] and induce change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farber|first=David|title=Chicago '68|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1988|pages=3–28|isbn=0-226-23801-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation for the Chicago convention, the Yippies held the "Yip-In", and the "Yip-Out" at [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]] in [[New York City]]. Both events were planned simply as "[[Human Be-In|be-ins]]", with live music. The event was used to promote peace, love and harmony, and as a trial run for Chicago.  The black banner of an [[anarchist]] group was hung on the wall, bearing the words, "Up Against the Wall Mother Fucker" in red. Police stood by watching the crowds. As the "Yip-In" progressed, relations between the police and Yippies became strained. Two people climbed a large clock and removed the hands; the police responded by clearing the station. They formed a [[skirmish]] line, ordered the people to disperse, and then started forcing their way through the crowd.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The "Yip-Out" was similar in purpose, but held in [[Central Park]]. To obtain the permits and aid from New York City officials necessary for the event, Yippies performed a [[sit-in]] at the mayor's office until the Mayor would negotiate on permits. In the end, an agreement was made on staging, electricity, police presence, bathrooms, and other necessities for running a [[List of music festivals|music festival]].  Police milled in the crowd giving considerable leeway to the proceedings which led to a peaceable day.&lt;ref&gt;Farber, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yippies took a radical approach to the Democratic National Convention. They wrote articles, published fliers, made speeches and held rallies and demonstrations, to announce that they were coming to Chicago. Threats were made that nails would be thrown from overpasses to block roads; cars would be used to block intersections, main streets, [[police station]]s and [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] armories; [[LSD]] would be dumped in the city's [[water supply]] and the convention would be stormed. However, none of these threats came to fruition. Nonetheless, city officials in Chicago prepared for all possible threats.&lt;ref&gt;Stien, David Lewis. Living the Revolution; Yippie in Chicago.  Indianapolis, Bobbs-Merril Co., 1969&lt;/ref&gt; A vilification campaign led by Chicago authorities worked in favor of the Yippies' plan.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

One of the Yippies' main tactics was to use street theatre to create an experience that drew the attention of mainstream America. Yippie activities were used to put across the message that the average American didn't have control over the political process. They tried to show this by purposefully participating in non-traditional activities that would not conceivably affect the decision making process in the convention hall, unlike a "straight" protest with picket lines, marches, and rallies which could conceivably convince delegates of mass support for a program.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} On a Wednesday night, networks moved their coverage away from the Amphitheater where the delegates were voting on the nomination, to a "pitched battle" in front of the [[Hilton Chicago|Conrad Hilton]] hotel.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam's involvement==
The other main group behind the convention protests was the [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam]] (often referred to as "MOBE"). MOBE was an [[umbrella organization]] that included groups who were opposed to American participation in [[Vietnam War|the Vietnam War]]. MOBE was run by a small executive board that set up a general framework for mass demonstrations, sent out invitations to the over 500 groups on its [[mailing list]]s, and coordinated activities between the groups. MOBE recognized and supported all tactics from marching to civil disobedience.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} MOBE's main aim was to get the largest turnouts at its functions. David Dellinger, MOBE chairman, believed that "The tendency to intensify militancy without organizing wide political support [was] self-defeating. But so [was] the tendency to draw way from militancy into milder and more conventional forms of protest."&lt;ref&gt;Farber, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

For Chicago, MOBE originally planned for two large-scale marches and an end of convention rally at Soldier Field. The goal was originally a massive show of force outside the International Amphitheatre.  MOBE also planned to have workshops and movement centers distributed in 10 parks throughout the city, many in predominantly black areas, to allow demonstrators and participating groups to follow their particular focuses.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Mayor Daley and the City==
[[File:19680810 20 Anti-War March.jpg|thumb|270px|This demonstration took place on August 10, 1968 as Chicago was preparing to host the Democratic National Convention.]]
In the buildup to the Convention, Chicago mayor [[Richard J. Daley]] repeatedly announced "Law and order will be maintained".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stg.brown.edu/projects/1968/reference/timeline.html|title=1968: a timeline of events|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago's security forces prepared for the protests during the convention.  Besides the standard gun and [[Club (weapon)|billy club]], [[Chicago Police Department]] officers had [[mace (spray)|mace]] and [[riot helmet]]s. For the convention, the CPD borrowed a new portable communications system from the military, thus increasing communication between field officers and command posts.  All summer long, [[police officer]]s had received refresher training on [[Riot control|crowd control]] and riot techniques.  During the convention itself, Police Academy instructors were with the reserve forces, giving last minute reminders.&lt;ref&gt;Farber, 128–32; Walker, 106–20&lt;/ref&gt;

To satisfy manpower requirements, the City put the force on 12-hour shifts, instead of the normal 8-hour shifts. This gave police commanders approximately 50% more field officers to deal with disturbances.  Two-thirds of the officers would continue with the normal police duties with the remaining third available for special assignment. In the Amphitheatre, the City concentrated 500 officers filling various roles.  In [[Lincoln Park]], the number of officers patrolling during the daytime was doubled, but the majority of the officers assigned to the Lincoln Park area were held in reserve, ready to respond to any disturbance.  In suspected trouble areas, police patrols were heavy.  Further away from the center patrols were less frequent.  This allowed the police to shift easily and quickly to control a problem without leaving an area unguarded.  While maintaining a public image of total enforcement of all city, state, and federal laws, the Narcotics division was quietly reassigned to regular fieldwork, curtailing anti-drug operations during the DNC.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 106–112&lt;/ref&gt;

Police officials and Mayor Daley had worked with the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] to create a plan to effectively use the Guard.  It would be called up at the beginning of the convention, but held in reserve at strategically placed armories or collection points such as Soldier Field. With the Guard in place at their armories, the CPD could request and receive assistance quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Tuttle, 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Permits==
Both MOBE and Yippie needed permits from the city in order to hold their respective events. The City had several reasons for denying permits to MOBE and Yippie and thus stalled issuing permits.  The City was worried about a black rebellion, independent of the white protesters, during the convention.  To avoid trouble, the City used its influence with black community organizations such as The Woodlawn Organization, the Black Consortium, and [[Operation Breadbasket]] to try to keep their constituents calm and peaceful.  Some of the militant black leaders were encouraged to leave town during the convention to avoid being implicated in any violence.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Daniel. ''Rights in Conflict''. New York, E. P. Dutton &amp; Co. 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The City also believed that having large numbers of white protesters marching through the black ghettos with a heavy police or National Guard escort would inflame the ghettos and set off rioting.  Therefore, the City categorically denied any permit that included parks in or march routes through black areas.

Another argument the City used to deny permits was that the permits asked the City to set aside local and state ordinances.  A city ordinance closed the city parks at 11 pm, although this was not strictly enforced.&lt;ref name="Gitlin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gitlin|first1=Todd|title=The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage|date=1993|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|location=New York|isbn=9780307834027|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Yippie, [[Deputy Mayor]] David Stahl gave eight rules for Yippie to follow, including submitting detailed plans and requirements, following all city, state, and federal ordinances, and toning down the rhetoric.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The Yippies refused, so the City felt justified in denying Yippie their permits.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} In a last-ditch effort, MOBE filed a lawsuit in [[United States district court|federal court]] seeking it to force Chicago to issue permits for a rally in Soldier Field or Grant Park.  Judge Lynch, Daley's former law partner, heard the case, and summarily dismissed the request,&lt;ref name=Gitlin /&gt; citing that the city could deny permits on the basis of protecting "public comfort, convenience, and welfare."&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Adam|last2=Taylor|first2=Elizabeth|title=American Pharaoh: Mayor Richard J. Daley|date=2001|publisher=Little, Brown, and Company|isbn=0759524270|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGem2g467GAC|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The start of the convention week's violence is sometimes traced to the shooting of Dean Johnson by Chicago police officers. Dean Johnson, age 17, and another boy were stopped on the sidewalk by the officers for a curfew violation early on the morning of Thursday, August 22. When Johnson drew and fired a pistol at police (the gun misfired), police officers returned fire, hitting Johnson three times.&lt;ref&gt;Farber, 165; Walker, 132&lt;/ref&gt; The Yippies and SDS hastily organized a [[Funeral|memorial service]] for Johnson, but as one observer noted, due to poor planning "it turned out that no one had made any plans to actually do anything. We just milled around and began to fill up the intersection. Two squad cars pulled up and the cops got out and told us to keep moving ... but they were pretty gentle about it".&lt;ref&gt;Stien, David Lewis. ''Living the Revolution; Yippie in Chicago''. Indianapolis, Bobbs-Merril Co., 1969. pp 37–42&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday, August 23, the planned protests began. Jerry Rubin and other Yippies attempted to formally nominate the Yippie candidate for president, [[Pigasus (politics)|Pigasus]], a pig. By the time Rubin arrived with Pigasus, several hundred spectators and reporters had gathered on the Civic Center plaza. Police officers were waiting, and as soon as the pig was released, Rubin, folk singer [[Phil Ochs]], and five other Yippies were arrested.

At 6 a.m. on Saturday, August 24, continuous surveillance began in Lincoln Park. For the previous several nights, the police had cleared Lincoln Park at 11 pm and maintained a significant presence during the day. [[Women Strike for Peace]] attempted to hold a women-only picket at the Hilton Hotel, the main delegate hotel. Despite plans for buses from around the country to bring hundreds of picketers, only 60 or so women showed up. This apparently failed protest was the catalyst for much of the convention week violence as MOBE and the SDS contingent realized that their "'liberal base' [had] finked out big".&lt;ref&gt;Farber, 172&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared that the expected hundreds of thousands of protesters would not be descending upon Chicago to disrupt the convention with their presence. It was generally agreed upon to not attempt to stay in Lincoln Park after the curfew, but to rather take the protest to the streets.&lt;ref&gt;Farber, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; At exactly 11 pm, poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] led protesters out of the park into the streets. SDS leaders organized several hundred protesters to march through the streets chanting things such as 'Peace Now' while the police simply guarded Lincoln Park. When the crowd stopped at Wells and North Avenue, blocking the intersection, a police contingent arrived and cleared the crowd. Eleven people were arrested and several [[police car]]s were stoned before the crowd dispersed into the normal Saturday nightlife.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 138–9&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, MOBE had scheduled a 'Meet the Delegates' march and picket. At 2 p.m. there were between 200 and 300 picketers marching across the street from the Conrad Hilton, and another 500 marching south through the Loop chanting, "Hey, Hey LBJ, how many kids did you kill today". After the police arrival, those who were picketing moved into nearby [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] to avoid a mass arrest situation. Once the marchers had reached Grant Park, there was a brief rally where Davis and Hayden claimed the day a success, and then went to Lincoln Park where the Festival of Life music festival was beginning.

[[File:August 25, 1968, Hippies in Lincoln Park, Chicago.webm|thumb|right|300px|Anti-war demonstrators in [[Lincoln Park, Chicago]]. The band [[MC5]] can be seen playing]]
At 4 pm, the Festival started with [[MC5]], the only band who showed up for the festival. The police did not allow a [[flatbed truck]] to be brought in as a stage, fearing Yippie would use it to incite the crowd. When the [[concession stand]] owner insisted that Yippie stop using his electrical outlets to run the amplification equipment, confusion ensued. While Rubin and other Yippies tried to make frantic deals to get the sound back on, Hoffman used the confusion to try to bring in the flatbed truck. A deal was struck allowing the truck to be parked nearby, but not in, the park. The crowd that had gathered around and on the truck did not realize an agreement had been reached and thought the truck was being sent away. The crowd surged around the truck, pinning in the police officers.

Hoffman declared that the police had stopped the music festival, and proceeded to conduct a workshop on dispersal tactics to avoid arrest by police. As the next police shift came on duty, they were informed of the tense situation in the park. Due to the number, frequency, diverseness, and exposure of the threats made by the protesters, the police were concerned about facing protesters armed with unknown weapons and unknown intentions.

At 9 pm, police formed a skirmish line around the park bathrooms. This drew a crowd of spectators who heckled the police. The crowd rapidly grew until the police charged into the crowd swinging their batons, scattering the crowd. The protesters exaggerated the violence and numbers of the police, and the police exaggerated the violence and numbers of the protesters. At 11 pm the police pushed the protesters out of the park. Most protesters left the park and congregated nearby, taunting the police.

Initially when the police reached the edge of the park, they maintained their skirmish line, however when a squad was ordered to 'clear' Clark Street to keep traffic flowing the police lost control. A running battle began. Yippie Jerry Rubin told a friend "This is fantastic and it's only Sunday night. They might declare [[martial law]] in this town."&lt;ref name="Biobaum 2011"/&gt; Order was not restored in [[Old Town, Chicago|Old Town]] until early Monday morning.

In Mayor [[Richard J. Daley|Daley]]'s convention report, a list of 152 officers "wounded" on Wednesday's melee was presented. Their wounds ranged from an officer's split fingernail to an officer's [[infra-orbital]] fracture of the left eye.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Department of Law. ''The Strategy of Confrontation; Chicago and the [[Democratic National Convention]], 1968''. Chicago, 1968. pp 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; Although the precise number of injured protesters is unknown, Dr. [[Quentin Young]] of the [[Medical Committee for Human Rights]] (MCHR) stated that approximately most of the 500 people treated in the streets suffered from minor injuries and the effects of [[tear gas]]. During the entirety of convention week, 101 civilians were treated for undisclosed injuries, by area hospitals, 45 of those on Wednesday night.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Daniel. ''Rights in Conflict''. New York, [[E. P. Dutton]] &amp; Co. 1968. p 353&lt;/ref&gt;

On the convention floor, several delegates made statements against Mayor Daley and the CPD, like Senator [[Abraham Ribicoff]] who denounced the use of "Gestapo tactics on the streets of Chicago" in his speech nominating [[George McGovern]]. ''Village Voice'' reporter Paul Cowan asked his editor not to print a story about the throwing of objects at the police, in hope to provoke reprisals to publish a story on the police riot which "seemed to me a far greater evil than the fact that some kids had wanted to provoke it".&lt;ref&gt;Gitlin, 330&lt;/ref&gt;

The rest of the convention week violence followed the pattern set Sunday night. Protestors were joined on 28 August by the [[Poor People's Campaign]], now led by the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]]'s [[Ralph Abernathy]]. This group had a permit and was split off from other demonstrators before being allowed to proceed to the amphitheater. The hard line taken by the City was also seen on the convention floor itself.&lt;ref name="Biobaum 2011"&gt;{{cite web|last=Blobaum|first=Dean|title=A Chronology|url=http://chicago68.com/c68chron.html|work=Chicago '68|accessdate=3 October 2012|date=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, [[Terry Southern]] described the convention hall as "exactly like approaching a [[military installation]]; barbed-wire, checkpoints, the whole bit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/convention96/retro/southern.html |title=Terry Southern reports from the 1968 Democratic Convention - November 1968 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=pbs.org/newshour |publisher=[[Online NewsHour]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the convention, journalists such as [[Mike Wallace]] and [[Dan Rather]] were roughed up by security; both these events were broadcast live on television.

Subsequently, the ''Walker Report'' to the [[U.S. National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence|National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence]] assigned blame for the mayhem in the streets to the police force, calling the violence a "[[police riot#United States|police riot]]". It later became said that on that night, America voted for Richard M. Nixon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0612FB3A541B7B93C0A91789D95F4C8685F9|title=U.S. Study scores Chicago violence as "a police riot"|author=Max Frankel|publisher=''The New York Times''|page=1|date=1968-12-02|accessdate=2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''1984 New York City Subway shooting''' took place on December 22, 1984, when four teenagers, {{ndash}} Barry Allen, Troy Canty, Darrell Cabey and James Ramseur {{ndash}} were shot by Bernhard Goetz on a [[New York City Subway]] train in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="johnson1987"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/20/nyregion/youth-shot-in-subway-says-he-didn-t-approach-goetz.html |title=Youth Shot In Subway Says He Didn't Approach Goetz |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 20, 1987 |last=Johnson |first=Kirk |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810024304/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/20/nyregion/youth-shot-in-subway-says-he-didn-t-approach-goetz.html |archivedate=August 10, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_1987-05-02" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;{{JSTOR|25112354}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated162"&gt;{{cite book |title=Political Trials in History: From Antiquity to the Present |editor=Ronald Christenson |date=January 1991 |isbn=0-88738-406-4 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |pages=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; All four were seriously wounded.

Goetz, who had used an unlicensed firearm in the shooting, surrendered to police nine days later and was charged with [[attempted murder]], [[assault]], [[endangerment|reckless endangerment]], and several firearms offenses. A jury found him not guilty of all charges except for one count of carrying an unlicensed firearm, for which he served eight months of a one-year sentence. In 1996, Cabey, who had been left [[paraplegic]] and brain damaged as a result of his injuries, obtained a civil judgment of $43 million against Goetz.&lt;ref name="kelley2000"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/10/nyregion/following-up-still-seeking-payment-from-bernard-goetz.html?ref=darrellcabey |work=The New York Times |first=Tina |last=Kelley |title=FOLLOWING UP; Still Seeking Payment From Bernard Goetz |date=September 10, 2000 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819105229/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/10/nyregion/following-up-still-seeking-payment-from-bernard-goetz.html?ref=darrellcabey |archivedate=August 19, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident sparked a nationwide debate on [[Race and crime in the United States|race and crime]] in major cities, the legal limits of [[self-defense]], and the extent to which the citizenry could rely on the police to secure their safety.&lt;ref name="Brooks" /&gt; Goetz, dubbed the "Subway Vigilante" by the New York press, came to symbolize New Yorkers' frustrations with the high [[Crime in New York City|crime rates of the 1980s]]. He was both praised and vilified in the media and public opinion. The incident has also been cited as a contributing factor to the groundswell movement against urban crime and disorder,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1985"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956277,00.html|title=Behavior: Low Profile for a Legend Bernard Goetz|first=John|last=Leo|date=21 January 1985|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2017|via=www.time.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822234059/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956277,00.html|archivedate=22 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the successful [[National Rifle Association]] campaigns to loosen restrictions on the [[concealed carry]]ing of firearms.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-feldman/bernie-goetz-the-subway-g_b_6369128.html |work=The Huffington Post |title=Bernie Goetz 'The Subway Gunman' 30 Years Later |date=December 22, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711131011/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-feldman/bernie-goetz-the-subway-g_b_6369128.html |archivedate=July 11, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context and background==
{{Main|New York City Subway#Crime|l1=New York City Subway crime|Crime in New York City}}
Bernhard Goetz stated that, while transporting electronic equipment in 1981, he was attacked in the [[Canal Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Canal Street]] subway station by three youths in an attempted [[robbery]].&lt;ref name="NYT_1985-01-01"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/01/nyregion/man-tells-police-he-shot-youths-in-subway-train.html |title=Man Tells Police He Shot Youths In Subway Train |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 1, 1985 |last=Daley |first=Suzanne |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902233449/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/01/nyregion/man-tells-police-he-shot-youths-in-subway-train.html |archivedate=September 2, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The attackers smashed Goetz into a plate-glass door and threw him to the ground, permanently injuring his chest and knee.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; Goetz assisted an off-duty officer in arresting one of them; the other two attackers escaped. Goetz was angered when the arrested attacker spent less than half the time in the police station spent by Goetz himself, and he was angered further when this attacker was charged only with [[criminal mischief]] for ripping Goetz's jacket.&lt;ref name="Time_1985-04-08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; Goetz subsequently applied for a [[Concealed carry in the United States|permit to carry a concealed handgun]], on the basis of routinely carrying valuable equipment and large sums of cash, but his application was denied for insufficient need.&lt;ref name="Time_1985-04-08"/&gt; He bought a 5-shot [[.38 Special|.38-caliber]] revolver during a trip to [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="Time_1985-04-08"/&gt;

In the early afternoon of Saturday, December 22, 1984, four [[African-American]] men from [[the Bronx]]—Barry Allen, Troy Canty, and Darrell Cabey, all 19; and James Ramseur, 18—boarded a downtown {{NYCS|2}} train ([[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line|Broadway–Seventh Avenue express]]). The men, each of whom previously had been arrested and convicted at least once, were on their way to rob a [[video arcade]] in Manhattan.&lt;ref name="NYT_1987-05-02" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_1985-01-10"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/10/nyregion/4-youths-shot-by-goetz-faced-criminal-counts.html |title=4 Youths Shot By Goetz Faced Criminal Counts |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 10, 1985 |last=Raab |first=Selwyn |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819104808/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/10/nyregion/4-youths-shot-by-goetz-faced-criminal-counts.html |archivedate=August 19, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the train arrived at the [[14th Street (IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line)|14th Street]] station in Manhattan, fifteen to twenty other passengers remained with them in [[R22 (New York City Subway car)|R22 subway car 7657]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?72501 |title=Showing Image 72501 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306042055/http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?72501 |archivedate=2009-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carinterior" /&gt; the seventh car of the ten-car train.&lt;ref name="Lesly"&gt;{{cite book |title=Subway Gunman: A Juror's Account of the Bernhard Goetz Trial |author=Lesly, Mark |publisher=British American Publishing |year=1988 |isbn=0-945167-08-3 |authorlink=Mark Lesly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--page23--&gt;&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Crime of Self-Defense: Bernhard Goetz and the Law on Trial |last=Fletcher |first=George P. |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=June 1990 |isbn=0-226-25334-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 14th Street station, Goetz entered the car through the rearmost door, crossed the aisle and took a seat on the long bench across from the door. Canty was across the aisle from him, lying on the long bench just to the right of the door. Allen was seated to Canty's left, on the short seat on the other side of the door. Ramseur and Cabey were seated across from the door and to Goetz's right, on the short seat by the conductor's cab.&lt;ref name="Lesly" /&gt; According to Goetz's statement to the police, approximately ten seconds later, Canty asked him, "How are you doing?" Goetz responded, "Fine." According to Goetz, the four men gave signals to each other, and shortly thereafter Canty and Allen rose from their seats and moved over to the left of Goetz, blocking him off from the other passengers in the car. By Goetz's account, Canty then said, "Give me five dollars." Canty and Ramseur testified at the criminal trial that they were [[begging|panhandling]], and had only requested the money, not demanded it. Cabey did not testify and Allen took the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].

===Sequence of shots===
Sources differ in reporting the sequence of shots fired, and whether Cabey was shot once or twice. The following are four versions from significant or reliable sources describing the sequence of shots:

====Cabey shot on the fourth and fifth shots====
Prior to the criminal trial, the media reported that Cabey had been shot on the fourth shot and then again on the fifth shot, with Goetz saying, "You don't look too bad, here's another," or, "You seem all right, here's another."&lt;ref name="NYT_1985-02-28" /&gt; This sequence of shots was discredited at the criminal trial when it was revealed that Cabey was shot once in the left side; however, some media still reported&lt;ref name="NYT_1996-04-24" /&gt; this sequence long after the criminal trial.

====Cabey shot on the fifth shot====
"Speed is everything," Goetz said in a videotaped statement made after he surrendered nine days later.&lt;ref name="Lesly" /&gt;&lt;!--60--&gt; He told police that while still seated, he planned a "pattern of fire" from left to right. He then stood, stepped clear of Canty, drew his revolver, turned back to Canty, and fired four shots, one at each man, then fired a fifth shot.&lt;ref name="Lesly" /&gt;&lt;!--60,153--&gt; At the civil trial years later he said, "I was trying to get as many of them as I could."&lt;ref name="NEWS_1996-04-13"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1996/04/13/1996-04-13_cool_goetz_tells_story_he_go.html |title=Cool Goetz Tells Story He Got As Many As He Could Shoot |newspaper=Daily News |date=April 13, 1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122074528/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1996/04/13/1996-04-13_cool_goetz_tells_story_he_go.html |archivedate=January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources repeated Goetz's statements to New York City police as to the sequence of shots: Canty was shot first, then Allen, then Ramseur, then Cabey.&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt;&lt;!--117--&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesly" /&gt;&lt;!--251--&gt; In the related proceeding ''[[People v. Goetz]]'',&lt;!-- discussed below at [[Bernhard_Goetz#First_and_second_grand_juries|First and second grand juries]],--&gt; the [[New York Court of Appeals]] summarized the incident:

{{Quote|It appears from the evidence before the Grand Jury that Canty approached Goetz, possibly with Allen beside him, and stated "Give me five dollars." Neither Canty nor any of the other youths displayed a weapon. Goetz responded by standing up, pulling out his handgun, and firing four shots in rapid succession. The first shot hit Canty in the chest; the second struck Allen in the back; the third went through Ramseur's arm and into his left side; the fourth was fired at Cabey, who apparently was then standing in the corner of the car, but missed, deflecting instead off of a wall of the conductor's cab. After Goetz briefly surveyed the train scene around him, he fired another shot at Cabey, who then was sitting on the end bench of the car. The bullet entered the rear of Cabey's side and severed his spinal cord.&lt;ref name="68_NY2d_96"/&gt;}}

According to his statements to police, Goetz checked the first two men to make sure that they had been "taken care of," then upon seeing that the fourth man, Cabey, was now sitting down and seemed unhurt, said, "You seem to be all right, here's another," and fired at him again.&lt;ref name="NYT_1987-04-30" /&gt; Cabey was shot only once,&lt;ref name="Lesly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_1996-04-24" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_1996-04-26"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/26/opinion/c-correction-003743.html |title=Correction |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 26, 1996 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306190354/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/26/opinion/c-correction-003743.html |archivedate=March 6, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--24--&gt;&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt;&lt;!--175--&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_1987-05-12" /&gt; a fact not made known to Goetz or his attorneys until shortly before the trial. One bullet missed, fragmenting on the steel cab wall behind Cabey. (The missed shot would also be the basis of a charge of [[endangerment|reckless endangerment]] of other passengers.)&lt;ref name="NYT_1987-05-12"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/12/nyregion/judge-refuses-immunity-to-youth-shot-by-goetz.html |title=Judge Refuses Immunity To Youth Shot By Goetz |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 12, 1987 |last=Johnson |first=Kirk |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110083322/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/12/nyregion/judge-refuses-immunity-to-youth-shot-by-goetz.html |archivedate=November 10, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cabey shot on the fourth shot====
At the Bronx civil trial, Goetz testified the first shot was Canty, Allen second, the third shot missed, Cabey fourth, and Ramseur fifth. The following similar shooting sequence is from Goetz's website:

{{Quote|I decided to shoot as many as I could as quickly as I could. I did a fast draw, and shot with one hand (my right), pulling the trigger prior to the gun being aligned on the targets. All actual shots plus my draw time occurred easily within 1.6 seconds or less. This is not as difficult to do as some might think, and occasionally I give a description of the technique along with a re-enactment. The first shot hit Canty in the center of the chest. After the first shot my vision changed and I lost my sense of hearing. The second shot hit lightning fast Barry Allen in the upper rear shoulder as he was ducking (later the bullet was removed from his arm). The third shot hit the subway wall just in front of Cabey; the fourth shot hit Cabey in the left side (severing his spinal cord and rendering him paraplegic). The fifth shot hit Ramseur's arm on the way into his left side. I immediately looked at the first two to make sure they were "taken care of," and then attempted to shoot Cabey again in the stomach, but the gun was empty. I thought Cabey was shot twice after reading a media account no shots missed; I had lost count of the shots and while under adrenaline I didn't even hear the shots or feel the kick of the gun. 'You don't look too bad, here's another', is a phrase I came up with later when trying to explain the shooting while I was under the impression that Cabey was shot twice. Cabey, who was briefly standing prior to the shooting, was sitting on the subway bench during all attempted shots. The others were standing. Shortly after the shooting my vision and hearing returned to normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berniegoetz.net |title=Bernie Goetz for Public Advocate |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051105014810/http://berniegoetz.net/ |archivedate=2005-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Goetz does a shooting demonstration (five shots in 1.0 seconds) on the [[Biography Channel]] show ''[[Aftermath with William Shatner]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1656896/episodes?season=1&amp;ref_=tt_eps_sn_1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514223547/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1656896/episodes?season=1&amp;ref_=tt_eps_sn_1 |archivedate=2018-05-14 |df= }} Bernhard Goetz/Aftermath with William Shatner&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Time'' magazine's theory (April 8, 1985)====
Goetz said one of the "boys" made gestures that may have implied he had a weapon.&lt;ref name="Time_1985-04-08"/&gt; Goetz rose and partly unzipped his jacket where the revolver was concealed, and plotted his "pattern of fire" for shooting them.&lt;ref name="Time_1985-04-08"/&gt; He asked Canty what he had said, and he repeated his statement. At this, Goetz unzipped his jacket the rest of the way, drew the gun, assumed a combat stance gripping the revolver with both hands, and shot Canty through the center of his body. He then turned to shoot Allen who had tried to flee, hitting him in the back, and then shot Ramseur, wounding him in the chest and arm.&lt;ref name="Time_1985-04-08"/&gt; He then shot again, at Cabey, but may have missed. According to Goetz he then approached Cabey and shot him on the ground; however, another witness disputed that Goetz shot Cabey a second time.&lt;ref name="Time_1985-04-08"/&gt;

===Cabey and the "here's another" issue===
Cabey ended up slumped in the short seat in the corner of the car next to the conductor's cab.&lt;ref name="carinterior"&gt;[http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?3217 Photo – interior of similar model car, an R-17] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213191435/http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?3217 |date=2009-02-13 }}, [[New York Transit Museum]]&amp;nbsp;– Goetz car was an R-22 with fiberglass seating&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Cabey was struck by the fourth shot or by the fifth was critical to Goetz's claim of self-defense; this issue was fiercely contested at trial.&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt;&lt;!--69,126--&gt; Medical testimony said that such an injury would render the lower half of Cabey's body instantly useless. According to the prosecution, the fourth shot missed; then Goetz shot a seated Cabey at point-blank range with the fifth. The defense theory of how Cabey ended up in the seat was that he was standing when hit by the fourth shot, then collapsed into the seat due to the lurching and swaying of the train; with the fifth shot being the shot that missed.&lt;ref name="Lesly" /&gt;&lt;!--208--&gt;

A summary of Goetz's statements to the police had become public two months after the incident, drawing intense media coverage. Probably most damaging to Goetz's public support and to his claim of acting in self-defense was his statement that he had said, "You don't look so bad, here's another," before firing at Cabey a second time. Media concentration on the summary's more damning portions created a public mindset that a wounded Cabey was shot a second time, with the second shot taken in a premeditated and deliberate way—an impression that stood uncorrected until the criminal trial two years later.&lt;ref name="NYT_1985-02-28" /&gt; The notion that Cabey was shot twice would still occasionally appear in mainstream sources over a decade later, as it did in a 1996 ''New York Times'' editorial.&lt;ref name="NYT_1996-04-26" /&gt;

At trial, one witness testified that Goetz approached to within "two to three feet" of a seated Cabey, then demonstrated how Goetz stood directly in front of Cabey and fired downward, a description that matched Goetz's published statements.&lt;ref name="Lesly" /&gt;{{rp|138}}&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt;{{rp|123–125}} Eight other independent witnesses testified that all shots came in "rapid succession";&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt;{{rp|171}} one of these said the firing lasted "about a second".&lt;ref name="Lesly" /&gt;{{rp|102}} None of the eight heard a pause before the final shot, and none saw Goetz standing in front of Cabey.&lt;ref name="Lesly" /&gt;{{rp|235}}

Whether Goetz actually said aloud the words "You don't look so bad, here's another" or only thought them is still a matter of dispute. He has subsequently denied on several occasions making the statement.&lt;ref&gt;Severin Mevissen: [http://www.stern.de/lifestyle/leute/:Was-...-...-Bernhard-Goetz/609378.html Was macht eigentlich&amp;nbsp;... Bernhard Goetz?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109162152/http://www.stern.de/lifestyle/leute/:Was-...-...-Bernhard-Goetz/609378.html |date=2008-11-09 }}'' [[Stern (magazine)|Stern]] 5/2008, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; One source said, "In all probability, the defendant uttered these words only to himself and probably not even mouthing the words, but just saying them in his own mind as he squeezed the trigger that fifth time."&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt;{{rp|175}}

===Flight and surrender===
The terrified passengers ran to the other end and out of the car, leaving behind the two women who had been closest to the shooting, fallen or knocked down by the exodus, and immobilized by fear. Goetz talked to them to make sure they were not injured, then was approached by the [[Conductor (transportation)|conductor]] of the train. Goetz stated, "They tried to rob me."&lt;ref name="Lesly" /&gt;{{rp|102}} The conductor asked whether Goetz was a police officer, receiving the reply, "No." Some time after a brief conversation in which he refused to hand over his revolver,&lt;ref name="Lesly" /&gt;{{rp|102}} Goetz jumped to the tracks and ran south through the tunnel to the Chambers Street station, where he exited the system.&lt;ref name="Fletcher"/&gt; He went home to gather some belongings, then rented a car and drove north to [[Bennington, Vermont]], where he burned his blue jacket and dismantled the revolver, scattering the pieces in the woods north of town. He drove around New England for several days, registering at motels under various names and paying in cash.

On December 26, an anonymous hotline caller told New York City police that Goetz matched the gunman's description, owned a gun, and had been mugged previously.&lt;ref name="NYT_1985-01-02"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/02/nyregion/irt-suspect-is-charged-as-fugitive.html |title=IRT Suspect Is Charged As Fugitive |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 2, 1985 |last=Daley |first=Suzanne |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202070515/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/02/nyregion/irt-suspect-is-charged-as-fugitive.html |archivedate=February 2, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_1985-01-04_2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/04/news/goetz-drove-across-new-england-for-several-days-before-surrender.html |title=Goetz Drove Across New England For Several Days Before Surrender |newspaper=The New York Times |last=Daley |first=Suzanne |date=January 4, 1985 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202070728/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/04/news/goetz-drove-across-new-england-for-several-days-before-surrender.html |archivedate=February 2, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 29, Goetz called his neighbor, Myra Friedman, who told him that police had come by his apartment looking for him, and had left notes asking to be contacted as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; He gave his side of the story to Friedman, and described his psychological state at the time:&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{cite news |first=Myra |last=Friedman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VMEBAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0_0#PPA34,M1 |title=My Neighbor Bernie Goetz |publisher=''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' |date=February 18, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goetz returned to New York City on December 30, turned in the car, picked up some clothing and business papers at his apartment, rented another car and drove back to New England. Shortly after noon the next day, he walked into the [[Concord, New Hampshire]], police headquarters and told the officer on duty, "I am the person they are seeking in New York."&lt;ref name="NYT_1985-01-04_2" /&gt;

===Statements to police===
Once the officer realized that Goetz was a genuine suspect, Goetz was given a [[Miranda warning]] and he waived his right to have an attorney present. After an interview that lasted over an hour, a Concord detective asked Goetz to consent to making an [[Sound recording and reproduction|audiotaped]] statement. Goetz agreed, and a two-hour statement was recorded. That evening, New York City detectives and an [[district attorney|assistant district attorney]] arrived in Concord, and Goetz submitted to a two-hour [[videotape]]d interview. Both interviews were eventually played back for the grand juries, the criminal trial, and a civil trial years later. When the audiotape was first played in open court, Goetz was described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "confused and emotional, alternately horrified by and defensive about his actions, and obsessed with justifying them."&lt;ref name="NYT_1987-05-03"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/03/weekinreview/everybody-is-edgy-as-goetz-trial-opens.html?pagewanted=all |title=Everybody Is Edgy As Goetz Trial Opens |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 3, 1987 |last=Johnson |first=Kirk |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306204855/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/03/weekinreview/everybody-is-edgy-as-goetz-trial-opens.html?pagewanted=all |archivedate=March 6, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his statements, Goetz described his past [[robbery|mugging]], in which he was injured and the only assailant arrested went unpunished. He called New York City "lawless" and expressed contempt for its justice system, calling it a "joke," a "sham," and "a disgrace". Goetz said that when the four men he shot surrounded him on the train, he feared being "beaten to a pulp" as well as being robbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bookrags.com/highbeam/goetz-labels-himself-victim-and-hb/ |title=Goetz Labels Himself Victim And 'Murderer' |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=May 14, 1987 |last=Kennedy |first=John H. |accessdate=2016-08-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605043429/http://www.bookrags.com/highbeam/goetz-labels-himself-victim-and-hb/ |archivedate=June 5, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He denied any premeditation for the shooting, something that had been speculated on by the press.&lt;ref name="Lesly" /&gt;{{rp|58}} Asked what his intentions were when he drew his revolver, Goetz replied, "My intention was to murder them, to hurt them, to make them suffer as much as possible."&lt;ref name="NYT_1987-04-30"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/30/nyregion/you-have-to-think-in-a-cold-blooded-way.html?pagewanted=all |title=...&amp;nbsp;You Have To Think In A Cold-Blooded Way |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 30, 1987 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607233032/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/30/nyregion/you-have-to-think-in-a-cold-blooded-way.html?pagewanted=all |archivedate=June 7, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in the tape, Goetz said, "If I had more bullets, I would have shot 'em all again and again. My problem was I ran out of bullets." He added, "I was gonna, I was gonna gouge one of the guys' [Canty's] eyes out with my keys afterwards", but said he stopped when he saw the fear in his eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1322122.html&lt;!-- |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73818658.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=May+14%2C+1987&amp;author=Margot+Hornblower&amp;desc=Intended+to+Gouge+Eye+Of+Teen%2C+Goetz+Tape+Says%3B%60My+Problem+Was+I+Ran+Out+of+Bullets%27 --&gt; |title=Intended to Gouge Eye Of Teen, Goetz Tape Says; 'My Problem Was I Ran Out of Bullets' |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=May 14, 1987 |last=Hornblower |first=Margot |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023052130/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1322122.html |archivedate=October 23, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the criminal trial, Goetz's defense attorneys, [[Barry Slotnick]] and [[Mark M. Baker]], argued that this and other extreme statements by Goetz were the product of emotion and an overactive imagination.

Goetz was brought back to Manhattan on January 3, 1985 and [[Arraignment|arraigned]] on four charges of attempted murder, with bail set at $50,000. He was held in [[protective custody]] at the [[Rikers Island]] prison hospital.&lt;ref name="NYT_1985-01-04"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/04/nyregion/no-headline-193196.html |title=No Headline |quote=Under tight security, Bernhard Hugo Goetz was returned&amp;nbsp;... |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 4, 1985 |last=Chambers |first=Marcia |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128135252/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/04/nyregion/no-headline-193196.html |archivedate=November 28, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Refusing offers of bail assistance from the public and from his family, he posted bail with his own funds and was released on bond January 8.&lt;ref name="NYT_1985-01-09"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/09/nyregion/goetz-posts-bail-and-is-freed-youths-he-shot-won-t-testify.html |title=Goetz Posts Bail And Is Freed; Youths He Shot Won't Testify |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 9, 1985 |last=Chambers |first=Marcia |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128104113/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/09/nyregion/goetz-posts-bail-and-is-freed-youths-he-shot-won-t-testify.html |archivedate=November 28, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early reports===
Because of the loudness of the shots inside the confined space of the subway car, there were initial witness reports that suggested the gun involved was a [[.357 Magnum]] revolver. Goetz alluded to these reports in a December 2004 interview on the ''[[Opie and Anthony]]'' radio show, saying that the first shot he fired that afternoon had been unusually loud in part because it was the first shot fired by the small-frame [[.38 Special|.38 caliber]] revolver after the factory tests, which "cleaned the barrel."

After the incident, rumors spread that Goetz had been threatened with sharpened screwdrivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/anniversary/35th/n_8601/ |title=The Joy of Goetz |journal=New York |last=Crouch |first=Stanley |date=April 7, 2003 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080902011058/http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/anniversary/35th/n_8601/ |archivedate=September 2, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This rumor was published as fact by some newspapers including ''The New York Times'';&lt;ref name="NYT_1987-05-02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_1984-12-30"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/30/weekinreview/the-little-known-world-of-the-vigilante.html |title=The Little-Known World Of The Vigilante |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 30, 1984 |last=Sanger |first=David E. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206133823/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/30/weekinreview/the-little-known-world-of-the-vigilante.html |archivedate=February 6, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, neither Goetz nor the men made any such claim. During his subsequent statement to the police, Goetz expressed a belief that none of the young men had been armed.&lt;ref name="NYT_1987-05-22"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/22/nyregion/the-goetz-defense-overcome-taped-statement-and-eyewitness-testimony.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Goetz Defense: Overcome Taped Statement And Eyewitness Testimony |date=May 22, 1987 |last=Shipp |first=E.

Bernhard Goetz was born on November 7, 1947, in [[Kew Gardens, Queens]], New York City, the son of Gertrude (Karlsberg) and Bernhard Willard Goetz, Sr. His parents were [[German American|German-born]] immigrants who had met in the United States;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-12-14/features/8604030432_1_mugged-subway-vigilante-new-york-city-subway/2 |work=Chicago Tribune |title=Wolf Or Wimp? |date=December 14, 1986 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120329094850/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-12-14/features/8604030432_1_mugged-subway-vigilante-new-york-city-subway/2 |archivedate=March 29, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rvhNqhrgkLcC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47|title=Quiet Rage: Bernie Goetz in a Time of Madness|first=Lillian B.|last=Rubin|date=14 August 1988|publisher=University of California Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goetz's father was [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]; his mother, who was [[Jews|Jewish]], converted to her husband's faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-22/news/vw-152_1_bernie-goetz |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Joseph |last=McNamara |title=Book Review : Goetz: Anger of a Loner, Rage in the Mean Streets |date=January 22, 1987 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170310040446/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-22/news/vw-152_1_bernie-goetz |archivedate=March 10, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-01-07/news/mn-11761_1_subway-gunman |work=Los Angeles Times |title=Crime Frustrated Goetz, Neighbors Say |date=January 7, 1985 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120329084723/http://articles.latimes.com/1985-01-07/news/mn-11761_1_subway-gunman |archivedate=March 29, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George P.

While growing up, Goetz lived with his parents and three older siblings [[Upstate New York|upstate]], where his father ran a dairy farm and a bookbinding business.&lt;ref name="Time_1985-04-08"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,965495,00.html?iid=chix-sphere |title=A Troubled and Troubling Life |journal=Time |date=April 8, 1985 |author=Richard Stengel |author2=Marcia Gauger |author3=Barry Kalb |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602033237/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,965495,00.html?iid=chix-sphere |archivedate=June 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 12, he was sent to [[Switzerland]], where he and his sister attended boarding school.&lt;ref name="biography.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/bernhard-goetz-578520|title=Bernhard Goetz|website=Biography.com|accessdate=29 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501200606/http://www.biography.com/people/bernhard-goetz-578520|archivedate=1 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goetz returned to the United States in 1965 for college, and earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[electrical engineering]] and [[nuclear engineering]] from [[New York University]].&lt;ref name="Time_1985-04-08"/&gt; By this time the family had relocated to [[Orlando, Florida]]; Goetz joined them and worked at his father's residential development business. He was briefly married, and after his divorce moved to New York City, where he started an electronics business out of his [[Greenwich Village]] apartment.&lt;ref name="Time_1985-04-08"/&gt;

==Public reaction==
"The Subway Vigilante," as Goetz was labeled by [[New York City media]], was front-page news for months, partly due to the repressed passions the incident unleashed in New York and other cities. Public opinion tended to fall into one of three camps: Those in the first camp tended to believe Goetz's version of the incident, that he was aggressively accosted and surrounded by the four men and feared he was about to be beaten and robbed. Those in the second camp tended to believe the version told by the four men, that they were merely panhandling to get some money to play video games. A third camp believed that Goetz had indeed been threatened, but viewed the shooting as an unjustified overreaction.{{citation needed|date = December 2014}}

===Supporters===
Supporters viewed Goetz as a hero for standing up to his attackers and defending himself in an environment where the police were increasingly viewed as ineffective in combating crime.&lt;ref name="NYT_1985-01-07"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/07/nyregion/angry-citizens-in-many-cities-supporting-goetz.html |title=Angry Citizens In Many Cities Supporting Goetz |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 7, 1985 |last=Fein |first=Esther B. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128134910/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/07/nyregion/angry-citizens-in-many-cities-supporting-goetz.html |archivedate=November 28, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Guardian Angels]], a volunteer patrol group of mostly black and Hispanic teenagers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/10/nyregion/46th-street-restaurant-row-starts-guardian-angel-patrol.html?pagewanted=all |title=46th Street 'Restaurant Row' Starts Guardian Angel Patrol |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 10, 1988 |last=Butterfield |first=Fox |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310092734/http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/10/nyregion/46th-street-restaurant-row-starts-guardian-angel-patrol.html?pagewanted=all |archivedate=March 10, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; collected thousands of dollars from subway riders toward a legal defense fund for Goetz.&lt;ref name="TIME_1985-01-25"/&gt; The [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE), a [[civil rights]] organization, supported Goetz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Goetz jury did not endorse vigilantism |work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |author=Rick Hampton |date=May 18, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its director, [[Roy Innis]], a member of the [[National Rifle Association]]'s governing board,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16324652&amp;ft=1&amp;f=5 |title='Ricochet' Goes Behind Scenes of Gun Lobby |date=2007-11-15 |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |accessdate=2007-11-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629195130/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16324652&amp;ft=1&amp;f=5 |archivedate=2009-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrawinningteam.com/bios99/innis.html "Roy Innis re-elected to NRA Board"], NRAwinningteam.com. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013003459/http://www.nrawinningteam.com/bios99/innis.html |date=October 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; offered to raise defense money, saying Goetz was "the avenger for all of us," and calling for a volunteer force of armed civilians to patrol the streets.&lt;ref name="TIME_1985-01-25"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956277-1,00.html |title=Low Profile for a Legend |journal=Time |date=January 25, 1985 |author=John Leo |author2=Jack E.

The prior criminal convictions of three of the four men (and the published accounts of such) prevented them from gaining much sympathy from many people. A special hotline set up by police to seek information was swamped by calls supporting the shooter and calling him a hero.&lt;ref name="NYT_1984-12-30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TIME_1985-01-25"/&gt;

Harvard Professor of Government [[James Q. Wilson]] explained the broad sentiment by saying, "It may simply indicate that there are no more liberals on the crime and law-and-order issue in New York City, because they've all been mugged."&lt;ref name="TIME_1985-01-25"/&gt;

===Other viewpoints===
Some believed the version of the incident as told by the four men – that they were merely panhandling with neither intimidation nor threats of violence. This view was later discredited when  Darrell Cabey, who had been paralyzed by Goetz's gunshot twelve years earlier, admitted in a newspaper interview with columnist [[Jimmy Breslin]] that his friends had indeed intended to rob Goetz, who looked like "easy bait".&lt;ref name="NYT_19960418"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/18/nyregion/goetz-defense-opens-calls-jimmy-breslin-and-a-psychiatrist-thencloses.html |title=Goetz Defense Opens, Calls Jimmy Breslin and a Psychiatrist, Then Closes |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 18, 1996 |last=Hoffman |first=Jan |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307090647/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/18/nyregion/goetz-defense-opens-calls-jimmy-breslin-and-a-psychiatrist-thencloses.html |archivedate=March 7, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some saw the incident as racial (with Goetz being white and the four young men black), and the jury verdict as a blow to race relations.

==Trials==

===Criminal trial===
The case was defended by [[Barry Slotnick]] and [[Mark M. Baker]]. Slotnick argued that Goetz's actions fell within the New York State's self-defense statute. Under Section 35.15, "A person may not use deadly physical force upon another person&amp;nbsp;... unless&amp;nbsp;... He reasonably believes that such other person is committing or attempting to commit [one of certain enumerated predicate offenses, including robbery]."

Goetz was tried before a Manhattan jury of 10 whites and 2 blacks, of whom 6 had been victims of street crime.&lt;ref name="NYT_1996-04-24"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/24/opinion/the-goetz-verdict.html |title=The Goetz Verdict |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 24, 1996 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421115634/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/24/opinion/the-goetz-verdict.html |archivedate=April 21, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TIME_1987-06-29"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,964773,00.html |title=Not Guilty |journal=Time |date=June 29, 1987 |author=Otto Friedrich |author2=Roger Franklin |author3=Raji Samghabad |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022233418/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,964773,00.html |archivedate=October 22, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was acquitted of the attempted murder and first-degree assault charges and convicted of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree – carrying a loaded, unlicensed weapon in a public place.&lt;ref name="NYT_1987-06-17"/&gt; He was sentenced to six months in jail, one year's psychiatric treatment, five years' probation, 200 hours community service, and a $5,000 fine. An appellate court affirmed the conviction and changed the sentence to one year in jail without probation. The order of the appellate court was affirmed because the trial court had not erred in instructing the jury that, if it found the People had proved each of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, it "must" find the defendant guilty. This was not a [[directed verdict]]. Goetz served eight months.

===Civil trial===
A month after the shootings, Cabey's lawyers [[William Kunstler]] and [[Ron Kuby]] filed a [[civil suit]] against Goetz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lectlaw.com/files/cas91.htm Text of Civil Complaint against Goetz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030812162500/http://www.lectlaw.com/files/cas91.htm |date=2003-08-12 }} Lectric Law Library&lt;/ref&gt; The case was tried in 1996, over eleven years later, in [[the Bronx]], with race as the dominant theme.&lt;ref name="NEWS_1996-04-23"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1996-04-23/news/17996525_1_darrell-cabey-goetz-darnay-hoffman |title=Goetz A Jerk, Not A Racist, Jury Told |newspaper=Daily News |date=April 23, 1996 |last=Fitz-Gibbon |first=Jorge}}&lt;/ref&gt; During jury selection, Kuby asked the mostly non-white prospective jurors whether they had ever been discriminated against.

The jury found that Goetz had acted [[Recklessness (law)|recklessly]] and had [[Intentional infliction of emotional distress|deliberately inflicted emotional distress]] on Cabey. Jurors stated that Goetz shooting Cabey twice was a key factor in their decision.&lt;ref name="NYT_1996-04-24$43m"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/24/nyregion/bronx-jury-orders-goetz-to-pay-man-he-paralyzed-43-million.html |title=Bronx Jury Orders Goetz to Pay Man He Paralyzed $43 Million |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 24, 1996 |last=Nossiter |first=Adam |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305055741/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/24/nyregion/bronx-jury-orders-goetz-to-pay-man-he-paralyzed-43-million.html |archivedate=March 5, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury awarded Cabey $43 million – $18 million for [[pain and suffering]] and $25 million in [[punitive damages]].&lt;ref name="NYT_1996-04-24$43m"/&gt;

Goetz subsequently filed for [[bankruptcy]], saying that legal expenses had left him almost penniless. A judge of the [[United States Bankruptcy Court]] ruled that the $43 million jury award could not be discharged by the bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/02/nyregion/bankrupt-goetz-still-owes-victim.html |title=Bankrupt, Goetz Still Owes Victim |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 2, 1996 |last=Holloway |first=Lynette |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403013229/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/02/nyregion/bankrupt-goetz-still-owes-victim.html |archivedate=April 3, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked in 2004 whether he was making payments on the judgment, Goetz responded "I don't think I've paid a penny on that", and referred any questions on the subject to his attorney.&lt;ref name="CNN_Grace"/&gt;

==Aftermath==

The New York State legal standard for the self-defense justification use of deadly force shifted after rulings in the case. New York State jurors are now told to consider a defendant's background and to consider whether a hypothetical [[reasonable person]] would feel imperiled if that reasonable person were the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;Opinion by Chief Judge Sol Wachtler, ''People v. Goetz'', 68 NY2d 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goetz and others have interpreted the significance of his actions in the subway incident as a contributing factor precipitating the groundswell movement against crime in subsequent years. While that claim is impossible to verify, Goetz achieved celebrity status as a popular [[Cultural icon|cultural symbol]] of a public disgusted with urban crime and disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Tipping Point]] |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |authorlink=Malcolm Gladwell |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |year=2000 |isbn=0-316-34662-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goetz occasionally gives media interviews about the 1984 subway incident that brought him into the public eye. In 2001 he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of New York City. In 2004, Goetz was interviewed by [[Nancy Grace]] on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', where he stated his actions were good for New York City and forced the city to address crime.&lt;ref name="CNN_Grace"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0412/17/lkl.01.html |title=Interview with 'Subway Vigilante' Bernhard Goetz |work=Larry King Live |date=December 17, 2004 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212123753/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0412/17/lkl.01.html |archivedate=December 12, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 he was interviewed and did a shooting demonstration on the inaugural episode of [[The Biography Channel]]'s documentary show ''[[Aftermath with William Shatner]]''.&lt;ref name="biography.com"/&gt;

In 2011, twenty-seven years after the incident, James Ramseur committed [[Suicide by poisoning|suicide by overdosing]] aged 45.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Weber | first=Bruce | title=James Ramseur, Victim of Bernhard Goetz Subway Shooting, Dies at 45 | website=The New York Times | date=2011-12-24 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/24/nyregion/james-ramseur-victim-of-bernhard-goetz-subway-shooting-dies-at-45.html | access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident inspired the 1990 ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' episode "[[Subterranean Homeboy Blues]]".

'''ASLERD''', the '''Association for Smart Learning Ecosystem and Regional Development''', is an interdisciplinary, democratic, professional association open to institutions and individuals. It was founded in 2015 by academics, researchers and scholars, mostly from European Institutions, with the intention of developing the work previously carried out by the [http://www.mifav.uniroma2.it/inevent/events/sclo/?s=166 Observatory on Smart City Learning] (2012-2015).
ASLERD is registered as a not-for-profit organisation under Italian law.

== Mission ==

The [http://www.mifav.uniroma2.it/inevent/events/aslerd/index.php?s=223 mission] of the association is to support learning ecosystems to develop their people centered smartness towards becoming incubators of social innovation and engines of sustainable regional development.

== Vision ==

ASLERD has adopted a more people centered vision of ecosystem "smartness"&lt;ref&gt;Giovannella C., Territorial smartness and the relevance of the learning ecosystems, ICS2 2015, IEEE publisher, pp. 1-5&lt;/ref&gt; that integrates the [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]&lt;ref&gt;Maslow A. H., A theory of human motivation, Psychological Review 50 (4), 1943, pp. 370–396&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Flow (psychology)]] theory:&lt;ref&gt;Czisikszentmihalyi M., Flow - The Psychology of Optimal Experience, 1990, Harper &amp; Row&lt;/ref&gt; "Ecosystems are smart when individuals that take part in the local processes achieve a high level of skills and, at the same time, are also strongly motivated and engaged by continuous and adequate challenges, provided that their primary needs are reasonably satisfied."

Unlike the most popular models&lt;ref&gt;Giffinger R., Gudrun H., Smart cities ranking: an effective instrument for the positioning of cities?, ACE, IV (12), 2010, pp. 7-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ISO 37120, http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=62436&lt;/ref&gt; used to benchmark the performance of [[smart cities]], in the ASLERD vision the ecosystem "smartness" is not determined by infrastructural or process and product indicators but emerges, bottom-up, from the opinions of all categories of players involved in the learning processes, as it has been shown in the case studies concerning European Campuses&lt;ref&gt;Giovannella C., Andone D., Dascalu M., Popescu E., Rehm M., Roccasalva G., Smartness of Learning Ecosystems and its bottom-up emergence in six European Campuses,
IxD&amp;A Journal, N. 27, 2015, pp. 79-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giovannella C., Andone D., Dascalu M., Popescu E., Rehm M., Mealha O., Evaluating the Resilience of the Bottom-up Method used to Detect and Benchmark the Smartness of University Campuses, ICS2 2016, IEEE publisher, pp. 341-345&lt;/ref&gt; and Rome's Schools.&lt;ref&gt;Giovannella C., Participatory bottom-up self-evaluation of schools’ smartness: an Italian case study, IxD&amp;A Journal, N. 31, 2016, pp. 9-18&lt;/ref&gt;
In such vision the development of  people centred ecosystem "smartness" is considered as a continual process that needs to be supported by participatory approaches, [[co-design]] practices and technologies.

==  Timişoara Declaration ==

At the first  ASLERD conference, held in Timişoara, (Romania) a document, ''Better Learning for a Better World - Through People Centered Smart Learning Ecosystems'', also known as The Timişoara Declaration, was signed on 19 May 2016 by representatives of some of the most prominent European Associations involved in the development of the Technology Enhanced Learning and of the Distance Education, including EADTU,&lt;ref&gt;[https://eadtu.eu/ EADTU]&lt;/ref&gt; EATEL, [[European Distance and E-learning Network|EDEN]] and IAFES&lt;ref&gt;[https://iafes.webling.eu IAFES]&lt;/ref&gt; The Timişoara Declaration recognizes:
* the leading role of [[design]] as driver of innovation at both organisational and didactic levels and of fostering the acquisition of a [[metadesign]] attitude by the students to prepare them as future citizens
* the need for a fully interoperable tech-sphere and phygital&lt;ref&gt;G. Roccasalva, L. Bazzanella, S. Valenti, Phygital pubblic space approach: a case study in Volpiano, Interaction Design and Architecture(s) Journal - IxD&amp;A, N. 20, 2014, pp. 23-32.&lt;/ref&gt; environments
* the social relevance of alternating school and work (Alternance Schemes and [[Dual education system|Dual Education]]&lt;ref&gt;S. Chatzichristou, D. Ulicna, I. Murphy, A. Curth, Dual Education: a bridge over troubled waters, European Parliament 2014, http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2014/529072/IPOL_STU(2014)529072_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) to restore learning ecosystems to their central place and to foster cooperation between students, teachers, families and territorial stakeholders
* the need to unlock the full potential of open forms of education
* the need for new models to benchmark the "smartness" of people centered learning ecosystems and territories
* that technologies are smart not because they are capable of replacing human reasoning but, rather because they can help towards achieving a people centred smartness, through streamlining mundane organisational tasks, and enhancing the skills of all actors involved in learning processes

== Activities ==

The association supports good quality research on Smart Learning Ecosystems and their relevance for social innovation and regional development by fostering networking and supporting projects at regional, national and international level (mainly European). The actions develop mainly in three ways:
* Relations between Learning Ecosystems and Regional Development
:to include: understanding and models, social innovation &amp; capital, [[capacity building]], cultural issues, sustainability.
*Competence Development
:to include: taxonomies of horizontal competences and interplay with digital competences,&lt;ref&gt;Giovannella C., Baraniello V., Smart City Learning, IJDLDC, vol. 3(4), 2013, pp. 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; educative visions, frameworks and methodologies to foster their acquisition, smart citizenship.
*Supporting Technologies
:to foster: interoperability of data and services, safety and security, privacy, trust and mediation,&lt;ref&gt;Calori, C., Rossitto, C., Divitini, M. (2013), Understanding Trajectories of Experience in Situated Learning Field Trips, Interaction Design and Architecture(s) Journal - IxD&amp;A, N. 16, 2013, pp. 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCullough, M., Attention in Urban Foraging. Interaction Design and Architecture(s) Journal - IxD&amp;A, N. 16, 2013, pp. 27-36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchem I., Pérez-Sanagustin M.., Personal Learning Environments in Smart Cities: Current Approaches and Future Scenarios, Elearning Papers no. 35, http://openeducationeuropa.eu/sites/default/files/asset/In-depth_35_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

ASLERD supports the development of Smart Learning Ecosystems by:
* promoting the transfer of competences, methodologies and technologies from laboratories to learning ecosystems (schools and other formal and informal learning ecosystems)
* offering free access to lectures, workshops, round tables
* promoting high-quality open access multidisciplinary publications

=== European dimension ===

The European relevance of the ASLERD vision, and previously that of the Observatory on Smart City Learning, was first recognized in 2013 with the inclusion of ''People Centered Smart Cities through Smart City Learning'' among the ''Grand challenges of the XXI century in Technology Enhanced Learning''.&lt;ref&gt;Grand Challenge Problems in Technology-Enhanced Learning II: MOOCs and Beyond, https://www.springer.com/la/book/9783319125619&lt;/ref&gt;
Recently ASLERD organized a session on ''"Smart Learning Ecosystems for social innovation and territorial development'' at "ICT2015: Innovate, Connect, Transform" ([[Lisbon]], Portugal) promoted by the European Commission - DG Connect. ASLERD is also committed to producing further analysis and collaboration among European Associations as outlined in the Timisoara declaration.
SLERD 2017 has been supported by European Platform for Adult Learning (EPALE) - [[Erasmus+]].

=== Conference and workshops ===

Members of the association, and previously of the Observatory on Smart City Learning, have been promoting ASLERD vision by organizing workshops and panels all over the world:

==History==
[[File:adbusters talkingrainforest.jpg|thumb|Adbusters' first uncommercial]]

Adbusters was founded in 1989 by [[Kalle Lasn]] and Bill Schmalz, a duo of award-winning documentary filmmakers living in Vancouver. Since the early 1980s, Lasn had been making films that explored the spiritual and cultural lessons the West could learn from the Japanese experience with capitalism.

In 1988, the ''British Columbia Council of Forest Industries,'' the "voice" of the logging industry, was facing tremendous public pressure from a growing environmentalist movement. The logging industry fought back with a [[television ad]] campaign called "Forests Forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAzlAu3sK3A |title=Forests Forever Ad (1988) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2009-06-19 |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an early example of [[greenwashing]]: shots of happy children, workers and animals with a kindly, trustworthy sounding narrator who assured the public that the logging industry was protecting the forest.

Lasn and Shmalz, outraged by the use of the public airwaves to deliver what they felt was deceptive anti-environmentalist propaganda,  responded by producing the "Talking Rainforest"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49mUeTWGWBE |title=Adbusters - Talking Forest |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2012-11-07 |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; anti-ad in which an old-growth tree explains to a sapling that "a tree farm is not a forest." But the duo proved to be unable to buy airtime on the same stations that had aired the forest-industry ad.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} According to a former Adbusters employee, "The CBC's reaction to the proposed television commercial created the real flash point for the Media Foundation. It seemed that Lasn and Schmaltz's commercial was too controversial to air on the CBC. An environmental message that challenged the large forestry companies was considered 'advocacy advertising' and was disallowed, even though the 'informational' messages that glorified clearcutting were OK."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010222222933/http://www.evolutionzone.com/kulturezone/futurec/culture.jammers.manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation was born out of their belief that citizens do not have the same access to the information flows as corporations. One of the foundation's key campaigns continues to be the Media Carta,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000817064152/http://adbusters.org/campaigns/mediacarta/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; a "movement to enshrine The Right to Communicate in the constitutions of all free nations, and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."

The foundation notes that concern over the flow of information goes beyond the desire to protect democratic transparency, freedom of speech or the public's access to the airwaves. Although it supports these causes, the foundation instead situates the battle of the mind at the center of its political agenda. Fighting to counter pro-consumerist advertising is done not as a means to an end, but as the end in itself. This shift in emphasis is a crucial element of mental environmentalism.

==Mental environmentalism==
The subtitle of ''Adbusters'' magazine is "The Journal of the Mental Environment."

In a 1996 interview, [[Kalle Lasn]] explained the foundation's goal:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What we're trying to do is pioneer a new form of social activism using all the power of the mass media to sell ideas, rather than products. We're motivated by a kind of 'greenthink' that comes from the environmental movement and isn't mired in the old ideology of the left and right. Instead, we take the environmental ethic into the mental ethic, trying to clean up the toxic areas of our minds.

You can't recycle and be a good environmental citizen, then watch four hours of television and get consumption messages pumped at you.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jim |last=Motavalli |date=30 April 1996 |title=Cultural Jammin' |url=http://www.emagazine.com/magazine-archive/cultural-jammin |journal=[[E - The Environmental Magazine]] |volume=7 |issue=3 |page=41 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923235938/http://www.emagazine.com/magazine-archive/cultural-jammin |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Issues==

===Anti-advertising===
Adbusters describes itself as anti-advertising: it blames advertising for playing a central role in creating and maintaining consumer culture. This argument is based on the belief that the advertising industry goes to great effort and expense to associate desire and identity with commodities.  Adbusters believes that advertising has unjustly "colonized" public, discursive and psychic spaces, by appearing in movies, sports and even schools, so as to permeate modern culture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;  Adbusters's stated goals include combating the negative effects of advertising and empowering its readers to regain control of culture, encouraging them to ask "Are we consumers and citizens?"&lt;ref&gt;[Marnie W. Curry-Tash, "The Politics of Teleliteracy and Adbusting in the Classroom", ''English Journal'' 87(1), 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ''Adbusters'' concludes that advertising conditions people to look to external sources, to define their own personal identities, the magazine advocates a "natural and authentic self apart from the consumer society".&lt;ref&gt;[ Joseph D. Rumbo, "Consumer Resistance in a World of Advertising Clutter: The Case of Adbusters", ''Psychology and Marketing'', Vol.19(2), February 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;  The magazine aims to provoke anti-consumerist feelings. By juxtaposing text and images, the magazine attempts to create a means of raising awareness and getting its message out to people that is both aesthetically pleasing and entertaining.&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/gcp/pdf/culturejamsandmemewarfare.pdf |title="Culture Jams and Meme Warfare: Kalle Lasn, Adbusters, and media activism", Wendi Pickerel, Helena Jorgensen, and Lance Bennett, 19 April 2002 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activism also takes many other forms such as corporate boycotts and ‘art as protest', often incorporating humor.  This includes  billboard modifications, [[google bombing]], [[flash mobs]] and fake parking tickets for [[SUVs]].  A popular example of cultural jamming is the distortion of Tiger Woods' smile into the form of the Nike swoosh, calling viewers to question how they view Woods' persona as a product.  Adbusters calls it "trickle up" activism, and encourages its readers to do these activities by honoring culture jamming work in the magazine. In the September/October 2001 "Graphic Anarchy" issue, Adbusters were culture jammed themselves in a manner of speaking: they hailed the work of Swiss graphic designer [[Ernst Bettler]] as "one of the greatest design interventions on record", unaware that Bettler's story was an elaborate [[hoax]].

===Media Carta===
"Media Carta" is a charter challenging the corporate control of the public airwaves and means of communication. The goal is to "make the public airwaves truly public, and not just a corporate domain."&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu" /&gt;  Over 30,000 people have signed the document {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} voicing their desire to reclaim the public space.
On 13 September 2004, Adbusters filed a lawsuit against six major Canadian television broadcasters (including [[CanWest Global Communications|CanWest Global]], [[Bell Globemedia]], [[CHUM Limited|CHUM Ltd.]], and the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]) for refusing to air Adbusters videos in the television commercial spots that Adbusters attempted to purchase. Most broadcasters refused the commercials, fearing the ads would upset other advertisers as well as violate business principles by "contaminating the purity of media environments designed exclusively for communicating commercial messages".&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu" /&gt; The lawsuit claims that Adbusters' [[freedom of expression]] was unjustly limited by the refusals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2004/09/15/adbusters040915.html |publisher=[[CBC News]] |title=Adbusters Takes Canadian TV Networks to Court |date=15 September 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206041611/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2004/09/15/adbusters040915.html |archivedate=6 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adbusters believes the public deserves a right to be presented with viewpoints that differ from the standard.  Under Section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, television is a public space allowing ordinary citizens to possess the same rights as advertising agencies and corporations to purchase 30 seconds of airtime from major broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Adbusters-Media-Foundation-971292.html "Adbusters Wins Legal Victory in Ongoing Case Against the CBC and CanWest", Marketwire.com, 6 April 2009] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There has been talk that if Adbusters wins in Canadian court, they will file similar lawsuits against major U.S. broadcasters that also refused the [[Advertising|advertisements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satyamag.com/may05/lasn.html |title=Satya May 2005: Interview with Kalle Lasn of Adbusters |publisher=Satyamag.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[CNN]] is the only network that has allowed several of the foundation's commercials to run.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Legal action===
On 3 April 2009, the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]] unanimously overturned a [[Supreme Court of British Columbia|BC Supreme Court]] ruling that had dismissed the case in February 2008.  The court granted Adbusters the ability to sue the Canadian Broadcasting Company and CanWest Global, the corporations that originally refused to air the anti-car ad "Autosaurus". The ruling represents a victory for Adbusters, but it is the first step of their intended goal, essentially opening the door for future legal action against the media conglomerates.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  [[Kalle Lasn]] declared the ruling a success and said, "After twenty years of legal struggle, the courts have finally given us permission to take on the media corporations and hold them up to public scrutiny."&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, Fiona (6 April 2009).  [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090406.wads0406/BNStory/National/home, Fiona Morrow, "Adbusters Wins Right To Sue Broadcasters over TV Ads"] ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital Detox Week===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Adbusters DigitalDetox.jpg|thumb|250px|Campaign logo for Digital Detox Week {{deletable image-caption|Friday, 4 January 2013}}]] --&gt;
In April 2009, the foundation transformed [[TV Turnoff Week]] into [[Digital Detox Week]], encouraging citizens to spend seven days "unplugged" without any of electronic devices such as video-game systems and computers.

===One Flag===
The "One Flag" competition encouraged readers to create a flag that symbolized "[[global citizenship]]", without using language or commonly known symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adbusters.org/about/adbusters |title=#118 - Adbusters &amp;#124; Journal of the mental environment |publisher=Adbusters |date=2015-02-17 |accessdate=2017-01-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031172500/http://www.adbusters.org/about/adbusters |archive-date=31 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns==
===Culture jamming===
[[File:American Corporate Flag.svg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;!-- vector version of the --&gt;American Corporate Flag]]
[[Culture jamming]] is the primary means through which Adbusters challenges consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;Lasn, Kalle (2000). Culture Jam, New York: Quill.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was described by [[Joseph Heath]] and Andrew Potter in their book ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'' as "the flagship publication of the culture jamming movement."&lt;ref name="rebel"&gt;[[Joseph Heath|Heath, Joseph]] and Potter, Andrew. ''[[The Rebel Sell]]''. Harper Perennial, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Culture jamming is heavily influenced by the [[Situationist International]] and the tactic of ''[[détournement]]''. The goal is to interrupt the normal consumerist experience in order to reveal the underlying ideology of an advertisement, media message, or consumer artifact. Adbusters believe large corporations control mainstream media and the flow of information, and culture jamming aims to challenge this as a form of protest. The term "jam" contains more than one meaning, including improvising, by re-situating an image or idea already in existence, and interrupting, by attempting to stop the workings of a machine.&lt;ref name="1 April 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cordweekly.com/cordweekly/news?news_id=2787 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410234323/http://cordweekly.com/cordweekly/news?news_id=2787 |archivedate=10 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As already noted, the foundation's  approach to culture jamming has its roots in the activities of the [[situationists]] and in particular their concept of ''détournement''. This involves the "turning around" of received messages so that they communicate meanings at variance with their original intention. Situationists argue that consumerism creates "a limitless artificiality", blurring the lines of reality and detracting from the essence of human experience.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;  In the "culture jamming" context, ''détournement'' means taking symbols, logos and slogans that are considered to be the vehicles upon which the "dominant discourse" of "late capitalism" is communicated and changing them&amp;nbsp;– frequently in significant but minor ways&amp;nbsp;– to subvert the "monologue of the ruling order" [Debord].

The foundation's activism links grassroots efforts with environmental and social concerns, hoping followers will "reconstruct [their] self through nonconsumption strategies."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/mar.10006 |title=Consumer Resistance in a World of Advertising Clutter: The Case of ''Adbusters'' |year=2002 | author = Rumbo, Joseph D. |journal=Psychology and Marketing |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=127–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The foundation is particularly well known for its [[culture jamming]] campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author = Willan, Claude |title=We're All Borf in the End |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/22/AR2005072202231_pf.html |work=The Washington Post |date= 24 July 2005 |accessdate=20 November 2007 |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the magazine often features photographs of politically motivated [[billboard]] or advertisement [[vandalism]] sent in by readers. The campaigns attempt to remove people from the "isolated reality of consumer comforts".&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu" /&gt;

===Blackspot Shoes campaign===
In 2004, the foundation began selling [[vegan]], indy shoes. The name and logo are "open-source";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/aboutblackspot.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522105440/http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/aboutblackspot.php |archivedate=22 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, unencumbered by private trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php# ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720081744/http://www.adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php |date=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attached to each pair was a "Rethink the Cool" leaflet, inviting wearers to join a movement, and two spots&amp;nbsp;– one for drawing their own logos and another on the toe for "kicking corporate ass."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://veganline.com/rethinkthecool.htm |title=Rethink the Cool - from Adbusters |website=Veganline.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three versions of the Blackspot Sneaker.  The V1 is designed to resemble the [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]-owned [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]] [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]] (Nike bought Converse in 2003).&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Aitch, Iain |title=Kicking against the system |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/politics/article82640.ece |work=The Independent |date=15 December 2003 |accessdate=20 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206133717/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/politics/article82640.ece |archivedate=6 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a V1 in "fiery red."

The V2 is designed by Canadian shoe designer [[John Fluevog]]. It is made from organic [[hemp]] and [[recycled]] car tires.

After an extensive search for [[anti-sweatshop movement|anti-sweatshop]] manufacturers around the world, Adbusters found a small union shop in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720081744/http://www.adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php |archivedate=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of more than twenty-five thousand pairs&lt;ref name="adbusters.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php |title=Blackspot – Blackspot Shoes |publisher=Adbusters.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720081744/http://www.adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php |archivedate=20 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; through an alternative distribution network is an example of Western consumer activism marketing.&lt;ref name="adbusters.org" /&gt;

Adbusters describes its goals vis-à-vis Blackspot as follows:

{{quote|Blackspot shoes is our experiment with grassroots capitalism. After spending many years railing against the practices of megacorporations like McDonalds, Starbucks and Nike, we wanted to prove that running an ethical, environmentally responsible business is possible ... and that taking market share away from megacorporations is better than whining about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Support + Subscribe | work = Adbusters.org | url = http://www.adbusters.org/support_subscribe | accessdate = 20 May 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120519224410/http://www.adbusters.org/support_subscribe | archivedate = 19 May 2012 | df = dmy-all }} Text 'hidden' under the "Why do we sell?" tab.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Reception====
Heath and Potter's ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'', which is critical of Adbusters, claimed that the blackspot shoe's existence proves that "no rational person could possibly believe that there is any tension between 'mainstream' and 'alternative' culture."&lt;ref name="rebel" /&gt;

In the June 2008 cover story of ''[[Businessweek|BusinessWeek Small Business Magazine]]'', the Blackspot campaign was among three profiled in a piece focusing on "antipreneurs." Two advertising executives were asked to review the campaign for the article's "Ask the Experts" sidebar.  Brian Martin of ''Brand Connections'' and Dave Weaver of [[TM Advertising]] both gave the campaign favorable reviews.

Martin noted that Blackspot was effectively telling consumers, "We know we are marketing to you, and you are as good as we are at this, and your opinion matters," while Weaver stated that "This is not a call to sales of the shoe so much as it is a call to participate in the community of Adbusters by buying the shoe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Meet the Antipreneurs | date = June–July 2008 |publisher = businessweek.com | url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_66/s0806039879656.htm?chan=search | accessdate =31 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the movement was started by Adbusters, the group does not control the movement, and it has since [[Occupy movement|grown worldwide]].

==Criticisms==
===Commercial style===
The foundation has been criticized for having a style and form that are too similar to the media and commercial product that adbusters attack, that its high gloss design makes the magazine too expensive, and that a style over substance approach is used to mask sub-par content.&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, Carrie. "[http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/9/adbusters.htm Culture Jamming (tm): Brought To You By Adbusters] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050825220611/http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/9/adbusters.htm |date=25 August 2005 }}." ''[[Stay Free!]]''. Retrieved 13 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heath and Potter posit that the more alternative or [[subversion|subversive]] the foundation feels, the more appealing the Blackspot sneaker will become to the mainstream market. They believe consumers seek exclusivity and social distinction and have argued that the mainstream market seeks the very same brand of individuality that the foundation promotes; thus they see the foundation as promoting capitalist values.&lt;ref name="rebel" /&gt;

The Blackspot Shoes campaign has stirred heated debate, as Adbusters admits to using the same marketing technique which it denounces other companies for using by originally purchasing much advertising space for the shoe.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;

===Legal issues===
Adbusters launched a legal challenge in 1995. A second in 2004 was against CBC, CTV, CanWest and CHUM, for refusing to air anti-consumerism commercials, therefore infringing on the staff's freedom of speech.&lt;ref name="Friesen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Friesen|first=Joe|title=Adbusters sing networks for not airing its TV spots|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=15 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, a CHUM representative is quoted as saying the ads "were so blatantly against television and that is our entire core business. You know we can't be selling our airtime and then telling people to turn their TVs off."&lt;ref name="Friesen"/&gt;

===Antisemitism===
&lt;!--Editors wishing to make substantive edits to this section are advised to peruse the relevant discussions that have taken place at the article's Discussion page.--&gt;
In March 2004, ''Adbusters'' was accused of [[antisemitism]] after running an article titled "Why won't anyone say they are Jewish?" The article compiled a list of [[neoconservative]] supporters within the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]] and marked the names of those it perceived as Jewish with a black dot. It questioned why, given Israel's role, the political implications of this Jewish neoconservative influence on [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] in the Middle East were not a subject of debate.&lt;ref name="AdbustersJewish"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adbusters.org/magazine/52/articles/jewish.html |title=Why won't anyone say they are Jewish? |author = [[Kalle Lasn|Lasn, Kalle]] | date = March–April 2004 |publisher=Adbusters |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040223012106/http://www.adbusters.org/magazine/52/articles/jewish.html |archivedate= 23 February 2004 |deadurl=yes |quote=Here at Adbusters, we decided to tackle the issue head on and came up with a carefully researched list of who appear to be the 50 most influential neocons in the US (see above).

Some shape policy from within the White House, while others are more peripheral, exacting influence indirectly as journalists, academics and think tank policy wonks.

===Ineffective activism===
Some critics claim that culture jamming does little to incite real difference.&lt;ref name="1 April 2009" /&gt;  Others declare the movement an easy way for upper- and middle-class citizens to feel empowered by engaging in activism that bears no personal cost, such as the campaign "[[Buy Nothing Day]]".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} These critics feel a need for "resistance against the causes of capitalist exploitation, not its symptoms".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

{{Arab culture}}
'''Arab identity''' is the objective or subjective state of [[Identity (social science)|perceiving oneself]] as an Arab and as relating to being Arab. It relies on a common culture, a traditional lineage, the common land in history, shared experiences including underlying conflicts and confrontations. These commonalities are regional and [[Tribes of Arabia|tribal]]. Arab identity is defined independently of [[religious identity]], and [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-dates]] the [[spread of Islam]], with historically attested [[Arab Christians|Arab Christian]] tribes and [[Jewish tribes of Arabia|Arab Jewish tribes]]. Arabs are a diverse group in terms of religious affiliations and practices. Most Arabs are [[Muslim]], with a minority adhering to other faiths, largely [[Christianity in the Middle East|Christianity]], but also [[Druze]] and [[Bahá'í Faith|Baha'i]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t7Ao8dYsCskC&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title=The Arabs in Palestine|accessdate=March 4, 2014|author=Ori Stendel|page=45|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=1898723249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PmgkD3Hel5IC&amp;lpg=PA309&amp;pg=PA297#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Between Heaven and Hell: Islam, Salvation, and the Fate of Others|author=Mohammad Hassan Khalil|accessdate=March 1, 2014|page=297|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab identity can also be seen through a lens of local or regional identity. Throughout [[History of the Arabs|Arab history]], there have been three major national trends in the [[Arab world]]. [[Pan-Arabism]] rejects states' existing sovereignty as artificial creations and calls for full Arab unity.

==History==

{{main|History of the Arabs}}
[[File:NE 565ad-Lakhmid.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Near East in 565, showing the Ghassanids, Lakhmids, Kindah and Hejaz.]]
The Arabs are first mentioned in the mid-ninth century BCE as a people living in eastern and southern Syria, and the north of the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-cRrGQ8bIAkC|title=The Ituraeans and the Roman Near East: Reassessing the Sources|last=Myers|first=E. A.|date=2010-02-11|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139484817|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Map of expansion of Caliphate.svg|left|thumb|Expansion of the [[Caliphate]].{{legend|#a1584e|Expansion under the Prophet [[Muhammad]], 622-632}}
{{legend|#ef9070|Expansion during the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], 632-661}}
{{legend|#fad07d|Expansion during the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], 661-750}}
|220x220px]]
The Arabs appear to have been under the vassalage of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–605 BCE), and then the succeeding [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (605–539 BCE), Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] (539–332 BCE), [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]]/[[Seleucid Empire]] and [[Parthian Empire]]. Arab tribes, most notably the [[Ghassanids]] and [[Lakhmids]] begin to appear in the south Syrian deserts and southern Jordan from the mid 3rd century CE onwards, during the mid to later stages of the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Sasanian Empire]].

The relation of ''{{transl|ar|ʿarab}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|ʾaʿrāb}}'' is complicated further by the notion of "lost Arabs" ''{{transl|ar|al-ʿArab al-ba'ida}}'' mentioned in the Qur'an as punished for their disbelief. All contemporary Arabs were considered as descended from two ancestors, [[Qahtanite|Qahtan]] and [[Adnan]]. During the early Muslim conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries, the Arabs forged the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] and then [[Umayyad Caliphate]], and later the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], whose borders touched southern [[France]] in the west, [[China]] in the east, [[Anatolia]] in the north, and the [[Sudan]] in the south. This was one of the [[List of empires|largest land empires in history]].

==Ideology==
===Arab nationalism===
{{main|Arab nationalism}}
{{See also|Nasserism|Ba'athism}}
[[File:Stevan Kragujevic, Gamal Abdel Naser u Beogradu, 1962.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] was a symbol and significant player in the rise of Arab nationalism]]
[[Arab nationalism]] is a nationalist ideology that asserts the Arabs are a nation and promotes the unity of [[Arabs|Arab people]]. In its contemporary conception, it is the belief that the Arab people are a people united by [[language]], [[culture]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[history]], [[geography]] and interests, and that one Arab state will assemble the Arabs within its borders from the ocean to the Gulf. The Arabs believed that they were an old nation. It showed Arab pride in [[Arabic poetry]]. In the [[Islam|era of Islam]], nationalism was manifested by the feeling of the Arabs as a distinct nation within Islam. In the modern era, this idea was embodied by ideologies such as [[Nasserism]] and [[Ba'athism]], which were the most common in the Arab world, especially in the mid-twentieth century until the end of the seventies, characterized by the establishment of the [[United Arab Republic]] between [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] and witnessed many other attempts of unity. Arab nationalism gained a new popular range as a result of the [[Arab Spring]]  and the emergence of an Arab popular trend calling for an Arab unity led by the people, not the authoritarian regimes that installed the wave of nationalism without accomplishing anything in this direction.

===Arab socialism=== 
{{main|Arab socialism}}
[[Arab socialism]] is a political [[ideology]] based on the confusion between Arab nationalism and [[socialism]]. Arab socialism differs from the socialist ideas prevalent in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=TORREY|first=GORDON H.|last2=DEVLIN|first2=JOHN F.|date=1965|title=Arab Socialism|jstor=24363337|journal=Journal of International Affairs|volume=19|issue=1|pages=47–62|doi=10.2307/24363337}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many, including [[Michel Aflaq]], Arab socialism was a natural step towards the consolidation of Arab unity and freedoms, since the socialist system of ownership and development alone can overcome the remnants of [[colonialism]] in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/no-arab-bolivars-region-implodes-arab-socialism-fizzles-out-1687981422|title=No Arab Bolivars: As region implodes, Arab socialism fizzles out|work=Middle East Eye|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cato.org/blog/coping-legacy-arab-socialism|title=Coping with the Legacy of Arab Socialism|date=2014-08-25|work=Cato Institute|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arab League]], formally the League of Arab States is a [[regional organization]] of [[Arab world|Arab countries]] in and around [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]] and [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. It was formed in [[Cairo]] on 22 March 1945 with six members: [[Kingdom of Egypt]], [[Kingdom of Iraq]], [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] (renamed [[Jordan]] in 1949), [[Lebanon]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arab League|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1E1-ArabLeag/arab-league|work=The Columbia Encyclopedia|accessdate=17 December 2013|year=2013}}{{Subscription required|via=Questia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sly|first=Liz|title=Syria suspended from Arab League|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-11-12/world/35282109_1_arab-league-president-bashar-syrian-national-council|newspaper=Washington Post|date=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its charter provides for coordination among member states in economic matters, including trade relations, communications, cultural relations, nationalities, travel documents and permits, social relations and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-15747941|title=Profile: Arab League|date=2017-08-24|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval Arab [[genealogist]]s divided Arabs into three groups:
* "Ancient Arabs" tribes that had vanished or been destroyed.
* "Pure Arabs" descending from Qahtan who was a descendant of Ishmael. 
* The "Arabized Arabs" descending from [[Ishmael]] the elder son of [[Abraham]].

[[Ethnic identity]] is another factor in Arab identity, who identify, linguistically, identically, culturally, societally, ancestrally, historically, politically, nationally and genealogically as "Arab".

In the modern era, it is defined who is an Arab based on these criteria:
* [[Genealogy|Genealogical]]: someone who can trace his or her ancestry to the [[Tribes of Arabia|Arab tribes]], from the [[Arabian Desert]], [[Syrian Desert]] and neighboring areas.&lt;ref&gt;(Regueiro et al.) 2006; found agreement by (Battaglia et al.) 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ancestor|Ancestral]]: belonging to Arab people, inherited from grandparents, or denoting an ancestor or ancestors.
* [[Self-concept]]: a person who defines himself as "Arab", belongs to the [[Arab Nation|Arab nation]].
* [[Personal identity|Identical]]: someone being as an Arab.
* [[Language|Linguistic]]: someone whose [[first language]], and by extension cultural expression, is [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name="Jankowskip244"&gt;Jankowski, James.

* [[Culture|Cultural]]: someone who belongs to Arab culture relating to the ideas, customs, and social behavior of a society.
*[[Politics|Political]]: someone his country is a member of the League of Arab States and who is in sympathy with the aspirations of the Arab peoples. (i.e. [[Somalis]] and [[Djiboutians]]).
* [[Society|Societal]]: while self-reliance, individuality, and responsibility are taught by Arabic parents to their children, family loyalty is the greatest lesson taught in Arab families.
* [[Nationality|National]]: one who is a national of an Arab state or characteristic of [[Arab nationalism]].

After the collapse of the [[Ottoman Caliphate|Ottoman Islamic caliphate]] in the 20th century, Arab nationalism emerged on the religious front. These two trends have continued to overcome each other to this day. Now, religious fundamentalism offers an alternative to secular nationalism. There are also different religious denominations within [[Islam]] and are often valuable to religion as a whole, leading to sectarian conflict and conflict. In fact, the social and psychological distances between [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]] Muslims may be greater than the perceived distance between different religions. Because of this, Islam can be seen both as a unification and as a force of division in Arab identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=García-Arenal|first=Mercedes|date=2009-01-01|title=The Religious Identity of the Arabic Language and the Affair of the Lead Books of the Sacromonte of Granada|jstor=25651684|journal=Arabica|volume=56|issue=6|pages=495–528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some Arabs, beyond [[language]], [[race (human categorization)|race]], religion, [[tribe]] or region. Arabic; hence, can be considered as a common factor among all Arabs. Since the [[Arabic|Arabic language]] also exceeds the country's border, the Arabic language helps to create a sense of [[Arab nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.britac.ac.uk/arab-origins-identity-history-and-islam/|title=Arab Origins: Identity, History and Islam - British Academy Blog|date=2015-07-20|work=British Academy Blog|access-date=2017-03-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Iraqi world exclusive Cece, "it must be people who speak one language one heart and one soul, so should form one [[nation]] and thus one [[country]]." There are two sides to the coin, argumentative. While the Arabic language as one language can be a unifying factor, the language is often not unique at all. Accents vary from region to region, there are wide differences between written and spoken versions, many countries host bilingual citizens, many Arabs are illiterate. This leads us to examine other identifying aspects of Arabic identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/841752039|title=Everyday Arab identity : the daily reproduction of the Arab world|last=D.|first=Phillips, Christopher, Ph.|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415684880|oclc=841752039}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arabic]], a Semitic language from the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic language family]]. [[Modern Standard Arabic]] serves as the [[Standard language|standardized]] and [[literary language|literary]] variety of Arabic used in writing, as well as in most formal speech, although it is not used in daily speech by the overwhelming majority of Arabs. Most Arabs who are functional in [[Modern Standard Arabic]] acquire it through education and use it solely for writing and formal settings.

Their sense of the Arab nation is based on their common denominators: language, culture, ethnicity, social and political experiences, economic interests and the collective memory of their place and role in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eid|first1=Paul|title=Being Arab: Ethnic and Religious Identity Building among Second Generation Youth in Montreal|date=2007|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=9780773577350|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=aalO4QlgAgYC&amp;dq=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative importance of these factors is estimated differently by different groups and frequently disputed. Some combine aspects of each definition, as done by Palestinian [[Habib Hassan Touma]]:&lt;ref name="Toumapxviii"&gt;1996, p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Arbeiderbevegelsens historie i Norge''''' ({{lang-en|History of the Workers' Movement in Norway}}) is a six-volume work about the [[labour movement]] history of Norway. It was released between 1985 and 1990 by [[Tiden Norsk Forlag]].

It was not the first work about the history of the Norwegian labour movement. [[Einhart Lorenz]] released the two-volume work ''Arbeiderbevegelsens historie. En innføring. Norsk sosialisme i internasjonalt perspektiv'' in 1972 and 1974.

This time, a large work was planned because of the 100th anniversary of the [[Norwegian Labour Party]] in 1987. As such, it is a party history combined with the history of other important parties as well as the trade union movement. Several of the editors and writers engaged in the project were in fact members of the Labour Party, or labour movement "sympathizers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=6-binds verk fra Youngstorvet|last=Seeland|first=Alf|date=12 November 1985|work=Aftenposten|page=5|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editors of the project were [[Edvard Bull, Jr.]], [[Arne Kokkvoll]] and [[Jakob Sverdrup (historian)|Jakob Sverdrup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ask.bibsys.no/ask/action/show?pid=851165133&amp;kid=biblio Entry] for ''Arbeiderbevegelsens historie i Norge'' in [[BIBSYS]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first volume, ''Arbeiderklassen blir til. 1850–1900'' was written by Edvard Bull. The second volume, ''På klassekampens grunn. 1900–1920'' was written by [[Øyvind Bjørnson]]. The third volume, ''Gjennom kriser til makt. 1920–1935'' was written by [[Per Maurseth]]. The fourth volume, ''Klassen og nasjonen. 1935–1946'' was written by [[Tore Pryser]]. The fifthg volume, ''Storhetstid. 1945–1965'' was written by [[Trond Bergh]]. The sixth volume, ''Nye utfordringer. 1965–1990'' was written by [[Jostein Nyhamar]]. The volumes were published unevenly, with the first volume released in 1985, the third and fifth in 1987, the fourth in 1988, and the second and sixth in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ask.bibsys.no/ask/action/result?fid=serieobjektid&amp;term=851165133 List of volumes]&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Nihongo|'''Black Dragon Society'''|[[Kyūjitai]]; 黑龍會; [[Shinjitai]]: 黒竜会|kokuryūkai}}, or '''Amur River Society''', was a prominent [[paramilitary]], [[ultranationalist]] [[right-wing]] group in [[Japan]].

==History==
[[Image:Uchida Ryohei.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ryōhei Uchida]], founder of the Black Dragon Society]]
The ''Kokuryūkai'' was founded in 1901 by [[Ryōhei Uchida|Uchida Ryohei]] as a successor to his mentor [[Mitsuru Tōyama]]'s ''[[Gen'yōsha]]''.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KrstMVr1fQ0C&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Yakuza: Japan's Criminal Underworld |last=Kaplan |first=David |publisher=University of California Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-520-27490-7 |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name is derived from the translation of the [[Amur River]], which is called Heilongjiang or "Black Dragon River" in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (黑龍江[[Traditional Chinese|&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;]]), read as ''Kokuryū-kō'' in Japanese. Its public goal was to support efforts to keep the [[Russian Empire]] north of the Amur River and out of east Asia.

The ''Kokuryūkai'' initially made strenuous efforts to distance itself from the criminal elements of its predecessor, the ''Gen'yōsha''. As a result, its membership included Cabinet Ministers and high-ranking military officers as well as professional [[secret agent]]s. However, as time passed, it found the use of criminal activities to be a convenient means to an end for many of its operations.

The Society published a journal, and operated an espionage training school, from which it dispatched agents to gather intelligence on Russian activities in Russia, [[Manchuria]], [[Korea]] and [[China]]. It also pressured Japanese politicians to adopt a strong foreign policy. The ''Kokuryūkai'' also supported [[Pan-Asianism]], and lent financial support to revolutionaries such as [[Sun Yat-sen]], and [[Emilio Aguinaldo]].

During the [[Russo-Japanese War]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|annexation of Korea]] and [[Siberian Intervention]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] made use of the ''Kokuryūkai'' network for [[espionage]], [[sabotage]] and [[assassination]]. They organized Manchurian guerrillas against the Russians from the Chinese [[warlord]]s and bandit chieftains in the region, the most important being Marshal [[Chang Tso-lin]]. The Black Dragons waged a very successful [[psychological warfare]] campaign in conjunction with the Japanese military, spreading disinformation and [[propaganda]] throughout the region. They also acted as interpreters for the Japanese army.

The ''Kokuryūkai'' assisted the Japanese spy, Colonel [[Motojiro Akashi]]. Akashi, who was not directly a member of the Black Dragons, ran successful operations in China, Manchuria, Siberia and established contacts throughout the Muslim world. These contacts in [[Central Asia]] were maintained through [[World War II]]. The Black Dragons also formed close contact and even alliances with [[Buddhist]] sects throughout Asia.

During the 1920s and 1930s, the ''Kokuryūkai''  evolved into more of a mainstream political organization, and publicly attacked liberal and leftist thought. Although it never had more than several dozen members {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} at any one time during this period, the close ties of its membership to leading members of the government, military and powerful business leaders gave it a power and influence far greater than most other ultranationalist groups.

Initially directed only against Russia, in the 1930s, the ''Kokuryūkai'' expanded its activities around the world, and stationed agents in such diverse places as [[Ethiopia]], [[Turkey]], [[Morocco]], throughout [[southeast Asia]] and [[South America]], as well as [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].

The ''Kokuryūkai'' was officially disbanded by order of the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|American Occupation authorities]] in 1946. According to [[Brian Victoria|Brian Daizen Victoria]]'s book, ''Zen War Stories'', the Black Dragon Society was reconstituted in 1961 as the Black Dragon Club (''Kokuryū-Kurabu''.) The Club never had more than 150 members to succeed in {{vague|reason= sounds most likely to be an utterly incompetant translation into English.|date=May 2018}}{{ambiguous|reason = i'd never consciously noted that we native speakers apparently avoid utterances where it's hard to resolve the ambiguity between the two def'ns of "succeed", which are "serve to replace [a person or org'n]" (i.e. "be the successor to") and "have success [at or in something]" [(i. e., fulfilling the performance of a task, which has to have been named, or otherwise explicated, by earlier wording].

==Activities in the United States==

The organization was an influence on seditious [[black nationalism|black nationalists]], aiming to foment racial unrest.&lt;ref name="TimeUSAtWar"&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=October 5, 1942 |title=U.S. At War: Takcihashi's Blacks |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,773723,00.html |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; African-Americans liked the symbolism of the black [[dragon]] fighting against the [[Bald eagle#National bird of the United States|American eagle]] and [[Royal Arms of England|British lion]].&lt;ref name="reginaldkearney"&gt;Reginald Kearney, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GjTmRdaYgYoC&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''African American Views of the Japanese: Solidarity or Sedition?''], SUNY Press, 1998, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party''' ({{lang-pl|Organizacja Bojowa Polskiej Partii Socjalistycznej}}, abbreviated ''OBPPS''), also translated as Fighting Organization of the Polish Socialist Party; also known as ''bojówki'' ([[paramilitary|paramilitary units]]); ''Organizacja Spiskowo-Bojowa PPS'' (''PPS'' Underground-Combat Organization); ''Koła Bojowe Samoobrony Robotniczej'' (Workers' Self-Defense Combat Circles) and ''Koła Techniczno-Bojowe'' (Combat-Technical Circles), was an illegal Polish [[guerrilla]] organization founded in 1904 by [[Józef Piłsudski]].

Its operations reached their zenith about 1904–1908, when it numbered over 2,000 members, including over 700 paramilitary personnel, and carried out over 2,500 operations. The organization had over 5,000 members at the height of its power. Afterwards it declined and was dissolved in 1911. Its goal was to create an armed [[resistance movement]] against the [[Imperial Russia]]n authorities in [[partitions of Poland|partitioned Poland]]. Its most notable operations included the [[Bloody Wednesday (Poland)|Bloody Wednesday]] of 15 August 1906; the failed [[assassination]] attempt against the [[Governor-General]] of [[Warsaw]], [[Georgi Skalon]], 18 August 1906; and [[Bezdany raid]], a major [[train robbery]], 26 September 1908.

==History==

The first action of the Organizacja Bojowa took place soon after the PPS started to organize an increasing number of demonstrations (mostly in [[Warsaw]]). On October 28, 1904, Russian [[Cossack]] cavalry trampled the participants in one of the demonstrations; in revenge, on November 13 the 'Bojówki' opened fire on the Russian police and military during a new demonstration.&lt;ref name="PPS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zamoyski-330"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Urb 113-116"/&gt; First concentrating on fighting the spies and informants, in March 1905 'Bojówki' started using [[bomb]]s to [[assassinate]] selected members of Russian police, both regular and secret ([[Okhrana]]) responsible for [[Political repression|repression]] of [[Poles]] in the [[partitions of Poland|partitioned Poland]].&lt;ref name="Urb 117-118"/&gt; 'Bojówki' also assaulted Russian transports of money leaving the Polish territories.&lt;ref name="Zamoyski-332"/&gt; Among the most famous of these was the [[Bezdany raid|raid at Bezdany]] near Vilna in 1908, led by Piłsudski himself.&lt;ref name="Urb 121-122"/&gt; The loot from that single raid (200,812 [[Russian ruble|ruble]]s–or approximately $100,000&lt;!--current or 1908 dollars?--&gt;) was a virtual fortune in contemporary Eastern Europe and equaled the amount 'Bojówki' had looted in the two previous years.&lt;ref name="Urb 121-122"/&gt;

In 1906 alone, the 800-strong ''Bojówki'', operating in five-man units in [[Congress Poland]], killed 336 Russian officials; the number of casualties declined in the coming years; while the number of its members increased (to around 2,000 in 1908)&lt;ref name="Zamoyski-332"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Urb 121-122"/&gt; but started declining significantly after 1908; in 1910 it numbered only 77 members.&lt;ref name="Urb 141"/&gt;

Organizacja Bojowa as a military arm of the PPS was viewed unfavourably by the other Polish political force, the [[right-wing]] ''[[endecja]]''. During the "[[Łódź insurrection (1905)|June Days]]", as the [[Łódź]] uprising in 1905 came to be known in Poland, armed clashes broke out between gunmen loyal to Piłsudski's PPS and those loyal to [[Roman Dmowski]]'s [[National Democratic Party (Poland)|National Democratic Party]] (''Endeks'').&lt;ref name="Zamoyski-330"/&gt; It was also not unanimously supported by all members of the PPS; in November 1906, a faction of the party split off in protest of Piłsudski's leadership.&lt;ref name="Zamoyski-332"/&gt; The Piłsudski's faction was known as ''Old Faction'' or the ''Revolution Faction'' (Starzy, [[Polska Partia Socjalistyczna - Frakcja Rewolucyjna|Frakcja Rewolucyjna]]), while their opponents were known as the ''Young Faction'', ''Moderate Faction'' or the ''Left Wing'' (Młodzi, ''Frakcja Umiarkowana'', [[Polska Partia Socjalistyczna - Lewica|Lewica]]). The Youngs sympathized with the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] and believed that the priority should be cooperation with Russian revolutionaries in toppling the [[tsardom]] and creating a [[socialist]] [[utopia]] first, and negotiation for independence would be easier later.&lt;ref name="PWN"/&gt; Piłsudski with his supporters from the revolutionary faction of the PPS, continued to plan a revolution against tsarist Russia.&lt;ref name="Poland.gov"/&gt; However, since then Organizacja Bojowa (temporarily known as Organizacja Bojowa PPS – Frakcja Rewolucyjna)&lt;ref name="PPS"/&gt; – and Piłsudski – acted increasingly independent from the PPS, whose revolutionary faction would try to organize a more controlled organization called 'Milicja Robotnicza'. Nonetheless the Young faction would soon disappear and Piłsudski's faction would again take the leading role within the PPS.&lt;ref name="Urb 131"/&gt;

Piłsudski anticipated a coming European war and the need to organize the officers of a future Polish army that could help win Poland's independence from the three empires that had [[partitions of Poland|partitioned her out of political existence in the late 18th century]]. One of the main goals of Organizacja Bojowa, other than providing funds for continuing activity and demonstrating the strength of Poland's underground, was to prepare a future cadre for the [[Polish Army]]. In 1906, Piłsudski, with the connivance and support of the Austrian authorities, founded a military school in [[Kraków]] for the training of ''Bojówki''.&lt;ref name="Zamoyski-332"/&gt;

In 1908, Piłsudski transformed the "Combat Teams" to "''[[Związek Walki Czynnej]]''" (Association for Active Struggle), headed by three of his associates, [[Władysław Sikorski]], [[Marian Kukiel]], and [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]].&lt;ref name="Zamoyski-332"/&gt; ZWC was not the last paramilitary organization created by Piłsudski, who would go on to create the Związek Strzelecki ([[Riflemen's Association]]) and the [[Polish Military Organization]] before his final goal, Polish independence, was achieved in 1918.&lt;ref name="Zamoyski-332"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cienciala"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cienciala |first=Anna M. |authorlink=Anna M.

==Notable operations==
Its operations reached their zenith about 1904–1908, when it numbered over 2,000 members, including over 700 paramilitary personnel, and carried out over 2,500 operations.&lt;ref name="PPS"/&gt; According to [[Leon Wasilewski]], the organization had over 5,000 members at the height of its power.&lt;ref name="O kształt niepodległej"/&gt; Afterwards it declined and was dissolved in 1911. Its goal was to create an armed [[resistance movement]] against the [[Imperial Russia]]n authorities in [[partitions of Poland|partitioned Poland]].&lt;ref name="Zamoyski-330"/&gt;

{{History of war}}
A '''command hierarchy''' is a group of people who carry out orders based on others [[authority]] within the group.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}  It can be viewed as part of a [[power structure]], in which it is usually seen as the most vulnerable and also the most powerful part. {{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

==Chain of command==
{{Redirect|Chain of command}}
{{Military ranks}}
In a [[military]] context, the '''chain of command''' is the line of authority and responsibility along which orders are passed within a [[military unit]] and between different units. Orders are transmitted down the chain of command, from a higher-[[military rank|ranked]] [[soldier]], such as a [[commissioned officer]], to lower-ranked personnel who either execute the order personally or transmit it down the chain as appropriate, until it is received by those expected to execute it. "Command is exercised by virtue of office and the special assignment of members of the Armed Forces holding military rank who are eligible to exercise command." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whs.mil/library/mildoc/AR%20600-20,%2020%20August%201986.pdf|title=Army Regulation 600-20 20AUG86|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, military personnel give orders only to those directly below them in the chain of command and receive orders only from those directly above them. A service member who has difficulty executing a duty or order and appeals for relief directly to an officer above his immediate commander in the chain of command is likely to be disciplined for not observing the chain of command. Similarly, an officer is usually expected to give orders only to his or her direct subordinate, even if it is just to pass an order down to another service member lower in the chain of command than said subordinate.

The concept of chain of [[Command and control|command]] also implies that higher rank alone does not entitle a higher-ranking service member to give commands to anyone of lower rank. For example, an officer of unit "A" does not directly command lower-ranking members of unit "B", and is generally expected to approach an officer of unit "B" if he requires action by members of that unit. The chain of command means that individual members take orders from only one superior and only give orders to a defined group of people immediately below them.

If an officer of unit "A" does give orders directly to a lower-ranked member of unit "B", it would be considered highly unusual (a faux pas, or extraordinary circumstances, such as a lack of time or inability to confer with the officer in command of unit "B") as officer "A" would be seen as subverting the authority of the officer of unit "B". Depending on the situation or the standard procedure of the military organization, the lower-ranked member being ordered may choose to carry out the order anyway, or advise that it has to be cleared with his or her own chain of command first, which in this example would be with officer "B". Refusal to carry out an order is almost always considered [[insubordination]], the only exception usually allowed is if the order itself is illegal (i.e., the person carrying out the order would be committing an illegal act). (See [[Superior Orders]].)

In addition, within [[combat]] units, [[line officer]]s are in the chain of command, but officers in specialist fields (such as medical, dental, legal, supply, and [[chaplain]]) are not, except within their own specialty. For example, a medical officer in an [[infantry]] [[battalion]] would be responsible for the [[combat medics]] in that unit but would not be eligible to command the battalion or any of its subordinate units.

The term is also used in a [[civilian]] [[management]] context describing comparable [[hierarchical]] structures of authority.

==Sociology==
In [[sociology]] command hierarchy is seen as the most visible element of a "power network", {{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}.  In this model, [[social capital]] is viewed as being mobilized in response to orders that move through the hierarchy leading to the phrase "command and control".&lt;ref&gt;[http://usacac.army.mil/sites/default/files/publications/15-12_0.pdf usacac.army.mil]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features===
{{Military units}}
Regardless of the degree of control or results achieved, and regardless of how the hierarchy is justified and rationalized, certain aspects of a command hierarchy tend to be similar:
* rank – especially [[military rank]] – "who outranks whom" in the [[power structure]]
* strict [[accountability]] – those who issue orders are responsible for the consequences, not those who carry them out
* strict [[feedback]] rules – complaints go up the hierarchy to those with power to deal with them, not down to those who do not have that power
* detailed rules for [[decision making]] – what criteria apply and when
* standardized language and terminology
* some [[ethics]] and key beliefs in common, usually enforced as early as recruiting and screening of recruits

===Problems===
However, people of such compatible views often have similar [[systemic bias]]es because they are from the same culture.  Such problems as [[groupthink]] or willingness to accept one standard of evidence internal to the group, but require drastically higher evidence from outside, are common.

In part to address these problems, much modern [[management science]] has focused on reducing reliance on command hierarchy especially for [[information flow]], since the cost of communications is now low, and the cost of management mistakes is higher—especially under [[globalization]]—than at any point in the past. It is also easier to replace [[Management|managers]], so they have a personal interest in more distributed responsibility and perhaps more [[consensus decision making]].

Ubiquitous command and control posits for military organizations, a generalisation from hierarchies to networks which allows for the use of hierarchies when they are appropriate, and non-hierarchical networks when they are inappropriate. This includes the notion of ''mission agreement'', to support "edge in" as well as "top-down" flow of intent.

The word '''denature''' is used in two food-related contexts.

==Protein==
When preparing proteins for consumption, there are three ways of denaturing the proteins: heating, acids, and mechanical force (e.g. whisking eggs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corriher|first1=Shirley O.|title=Cookwise: the hows and whys of successful cooking|date=1997|publisher=William Morrow|isbn=0-688-10229-8|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGee|first1=Harold|title=On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen|date=2004|publisher=Scribner|isbn=0-684-80001-2|page=806|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three methods have the same result: [[hydrogen bonds]] in the proteins are broken allowing the proteins to "unwind". When the proteins are unwound, they have been altered from their natural state and are considered denatured. Once denatured, the proteins are free to interact with other chemicals in the food like the [[Maillard reaction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGee|first1=Harold|title=On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen|date=2004|publisher=Scribner|isbn=0-684-80001-2|pages=778–779}}&lt;/ref&gt; or recombine with itself to [[coagulate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corriher|first1=Shirley O.|title=Cookwise: the hows and whys of successful cooking|date=1997|publisher=William Morrow|isbn=0-688-10229-8|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGee|first1=Harold|title=On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen|date=2004|publisher=Scribner|isbn=0-684-80001-2|pages=808–809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preventing consumption ==
To render food unpleasant or dangerous to consume, it is denatured by adding a substance known as a denaturant. [[Aversive agent]]s—primarily [[bitterant]]s and [[pungent|pungent agents]]—are used to produce an unpleasant flavor. For example, the bitterant [[denatonium]] might be added to food used in a [[laboratory]], where such food is not intended for human consumption. A [[poison|poisonous substance]] may be added as an even more powerful deterrent. For example, [[methanol]] is blended with [[ethanol]] to produce [[denatured alcohol]]. The addition of methanol, which is poisonous, renders [[denatured alcohol]] unfit for consumption, as ingesting denatured alcohol may result in serious injury or death. Thus [[denatured alcohol]] is not subject to the taxes usually levied on the production and sale of [[alcoholic beverages]]. [[Aniline]] was used to denature [[colza oil]] in the 1980s.

[[File:Rosler-LeFlaneur.jpg|thumb|Paul Gavarni, ''Le Flâneur'', 1842]]

'''''Flâneur''''' ({{IPA-fr|flɑnœʁ|pron}}), from the French noun ''flâneur'', means "stroller", "lounger", "saunterer", or "loafer". ''Flânerie'' is the act of strolling, with all of its accompanying associations. A near-synonym is '''boulevardier'''.

The flâneur was, first of all, a literary type from 19th-century [[France]], essential to any picture of the streets of [[Paris]]. The word carried a set of rich associations: the man of [[leisure]], the idler, the urban explorer, the connoisseur of the street. It was [[Walter Benjamin]], drawing on the poetry of [[Charles Baudelaire]], who made this figure the object of scholarly interest in the 20th century, as an emblematic archetype of urban, modern experience.&lt;ref name="shaya2004"&gt;Gregory Shaya, "[https://www.academia.edu/1430722/Erratum_The_Fl%C3%A2neur_the_Badaud_and_the_Making_of_a_Mass_Public_in_France_circa_1860_1910_ The Flâneur, the Badaud, and the Making of a Mass Public in France, circa 1860–1910]", ''American Historical Review'' 109 (2004), par 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Benjamin, the flâneur has become an important symbol for scholars, artists and writers.

==Etymology ==
[[Image:Étienne Carjat, Portrait of Charles Baudelaire, circa 1862.jpg|thumb|upright|Charles Baudelaire]]

Flâneur in English is via French from the Old Norse verb flana "to wander with no purpose".

The terms of ''flânerie'' date to the 16th or 17th century, denoting strolling, idling, often with the connotation of wasting time. But it was in the 19th century that a rich set of meanings and definitions surrounding the ''flâneur'' took shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turcot|first=Laurent|title=Le promeneur à Paris au XVIIIe siècle|year=2008|publisher=Gallimard|location=Paris|isbn=2070783669|pages=10–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''flâneur'' was defined in a long article in Larousse's ''[[Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle]]'' (in the 8th volume, from 1872). It described the ''flâneur'' in ambivalent terms, equal parts curiosity and laziness and presented a taxonomy of ''flânerie''—''flâneurs'' of the boulevards, of parks, of the arcades, of cafés, mindless ''flâneurs'' and intelligent ''flâneurs''.&lt;ref name="gdu"&gt;"[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k205356p ''Grand dictionnaire universel'']", vol. 8, v. ''flâneur'' and ''flânerie''.&lt;/ref&gt;

By then, the term had already developed a rich set of associations. [[Sainte-Beuve]] wrote that to ''flâne'' "is the very opposite of doing nothing".&lt;ref name="gdu"/&gt; [[Honoré de Balzac]] described ''flânerie'' as "the gastronomy of the eye".&lt;ref name="gdu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futurelab.net/blog/2012/02/fl%C3%A2neurs-and-gastronomy-eye Flâneurs and the "Gastronomy of the Eye"] at [http://www.futurelab.net Future Lab]&lt;/ref&gt; Anaïs Bazin wrote that "the only, the true sovereign of Paris is the ''flâneur''".&lt;ref name="gdu"/&gt; Victor Fournel, in ''Ce qu'on voit dans les rues de Paris'' (''What One Sees in the Streets of Paris'', 1867), devoted a chapter to "the art of ''flânerie''". For Fournel, there was nothing lazy in ''flânerie''. It was, rather, a way of understanding the rich variety of the city landscape. It was a moving photograph ("un daguerréotype mobile et passioné") of urban experience.&lt;ref name="fournel"&gt;Victor Fournel, ''[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k757298 Ce qu'on voit dans les rues de Paris,]'' p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s, in the midst of the rebuilding of Paris under [[Napoleon III]] and the [[Baron Haussmann]], [[Charles Baudelaire]] presented a memorable portrait of the ''flâneur'' as the artist-poet of the modern metropolis:

{{quote|text=The crowd is his element, as the air is that of birds and water of fishes. His passion and his profession are to become one flesh with the crowd. For the perfect ''flâneur'', for the passionate spectator, it is an immense joy to set up house in the heart of the multitude, amid the ebb and flow of movement, in the midst of the fugitive and the infinite. To be away from home and yet to feel oneself everywhere at home; to see the world, to be at the centre of the world, and yet to remain hidden from the world—impartial natures which the tongue can but clumsily define. The spectator is a prince who everywhere rejoices in his incognito. The lover of life makes the whole world his family, just like the lover of the fair sex who builds up his family from all the beautiful women that he has ever found, or that are or are not—to be found; or the lover of pictures who lives in a magical society of dreams painted on canvas. Thus the lover of universal life enters into the crowd as though it were an immense reservoir of electrical energy. Or we might liken him to a mirror as vast as the crowd itself; or to a kaleidoscope gifted with consciousness, responding to each one of its movements and reproducing the multiplicity of life and the flickering grace of all the elements of life.|sign=Charles Baudelaire|source="The Painter of Modern Life", (New York: Da Capo Press, 1964). Orig. published in ''Le Figaro'', in 1863.}}

Drawing on Fournel, and on his analysis of the poetry of Baudelaire, [[Walter Benjamin]] described the ''flâneur'' as the essential figure of the modern urban spectator, an amateur detective and investigator of the city. More than this, his ''flâneur'' was a sign of the alienation of the city and of capitalism. For Benjamin, the ''flâneur'' met his demise with the triumph of [[consumer capitalism]].&lt;ref name="benjamin"&gt;Walter Benjamin, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XYsqAQAAIAAJ&amp;q Charles Baudelaire: A Lyric Poet in the Era of High Capitalism]'', Harry Zohn, trans. (London, 1983), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In these texts, the ''flâneur'' was often juxtaposed to the figure of the ''[[badaud]]'', the gawker or gaper. Fournel wrote: "The ''flâneur'' must not be confused with the ''badaud''; a nuance should be observed there…. The simple ''flâneur'' is always in full possession of his individuality, whereas the individuality of the ''badaud'' disappears. It is absorbed by the outside world…which intoxicates him to the point where he forgets himself. Under the influence of the spectacle which presents itself to him, the ''badaud'' becomes an impersonal creature; he is no longer a human being, he is part of the public, of the crowd."&lt;ref name="fournel270"&gt;Victor Fournel, ''[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k757298 Ce qu'on voit dans les rues de Paris]'', (Paris, 1867), p. 270. See Shaya 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades since Benjamin, the ''flâneur'' has been the subject of a remarkable number of appropriations and interpretations. The figure of the ''flâneur'' has been used—among other things—to explain modern, urban experience, to explain urban spectatorship, to explain the class tensions and gender divisions of the nineteenth-century city, to describe modern alienation, to explain the sources of mass culture, to explain the postmodern spectatorial gaze.&lt;ref&gt;See, among others, Buck-Morss, 1986; Buck-Morss, 1989; Wolff, 1985; Charney and Schwartz, 1995; Tester, 1994; Ferguson, 1994; Prendergast, 1992; Feathersone, 1998; Friedberg, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; And it has served as a source of inspiration to writers and artists.

The female counterpart of the ''flâneur'', the ''passante'' (French for 'walker', 'passer-by'), appears in particular in the work of [[Marcel Proust]]. He portrayed several of his female characters as elusive, passing figures, who tended to ignore his obsessive (and at times possessive) view of them. Increasing freedoms and social innovations such as industrialisation later allowed the ''passante'' to become an active participant in the 19th century metropolis, as women's social roles expanded away from the domestic and the private and into the public and urban spheres.

==Urban life==
[[File:Gustave Caillebotte - Paris Street; Rainy Day - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Gustave Caillebotte. ''[[Paris Street, Rainy Day]]'', 1877. [[Art Institute of Chicago]].]]
[[File:Caillebotte-PontdeL'Europe-Geneva.jpg|thumbnail|Gustave Caillebotte, ''[[Le Pont de l'Europe]]'', oil on canvas, 1876. [[Musée du Petit Palais]], Geneva.]]
While Baudelaire characterized the ''flâneur'' as a "gentleman stroller of city streets,"&lt;ref name=NYM&gt;{{cite news|last=Saltz|first=Jerry|title=Modern Machinery|url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/49958/|accessdate=9 May 2011|newspaper=New York Magazine|date=Sep 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; he saw the ''flâneur'' as having a key role in understanding, participating in, and portraying the city. A ''flâneur'' thus played a double role in city life and in theory, that is, while remaining a detached observer. This stance, simultaneously part of and apart from, combines sociological, anthropological, literary, and historical notions of the relationship between the individual and the greater populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turcot|first=Laurent|title="Promenades et flâneries à Paris du XVIIe au XXIe siècles: la marche comme construction d'une identité urbaine ", Marcher en ville. Faire corps, prendre corps, donner corps aux ambiances urbaines|editor=Rachel Thomas|year=2010|publisher=Ed. des Archives Contemporaines|location=Paris|language=French|isbn=9782813000262|pages=70–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period after the [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 Revolution in France]], during which the Empire was reestablished with clearly bourgeois pretensions of "order" and "morals", Baudelaire began asserting that traditional art was inadequate for the new dynamic complications of modern life. Social and economic changes brought by industrialization demanded that the artist immerse himself in the metropolis and become, in Baudelaire's phrase, "a botanist of the sidewalk".&lt;ref name=NYM/&gt; [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] asserts that "Baudelaire would be torn the rest of his life between the stances of ''flâneur'' and [[dandy]], a disengaged and cynical voyeur on the one hand, and man of the people who enters into the life of his subjects with passion on the other".&lt;ref&gt;''Paris: Capital of Modernity'' 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The observer–participant [[dialectic]] is evidenced in part by the dandy culture. Highly self-aware, and to a certain degree flamboyant and theatrical, dandies of the mid-nineteenth century created scenes through self-consciously outrageous acts like walking turtles on leashes down the streets of Paris. Such acts exemplify a ''flâneur'''s active participation in and fascination with street life while displaying a critical attitude towards the uniformity, speed, and anonymity of modern life in the city.

The concept of the ''flâneur'' is important in academic discussions of the phenomenon of [[modernity]]. While Baudelaire's aesthetic and critical visions helped open up the modern city as a space for investigation, theorists such as [[Georg Simmel]] began to codify the urban experience in more sociological and psychological terms. In his essay "[[The Metropolis and Mental Life]]", Simmel theorized that the complexities of the modern city create new social bonds and new attitudes towards others. The modern city was transforming humans, giving them a new relationship to time and space, inculcating in them a "blasé attitude," and altering fundamental notions of freedom and being:

{{quote|text=The deepest problems of modern life derive from the claim of the individual to preserve the autonomy and individuality of his existence in the face of overwhelming social forces, of historical heritage, of external culture, and of the technique of life. The fight with nature which primitive man has to wage for his bodily existence attains in this modern form its latest transformation. The eighteenth century called upon man to free himself of all the historical bonds in the state and in religion, in morals and in economics. Man's nature, originally good and common to all, should develop unhampered. In addition to more liberty, the nineteenth century demanded the functional specialization of man and his work; this specialization makes one individual incomparable to another, and each of them indispensable to the highest possible extent. However, this specialization makes each man the more directly dependent upon the supplementary activities of all others. Nietzsche sees the full development of the individual conditioned by the most ruthless struggle of individuals; socialism believes in the suppression of all competition for the same reason. Be that as it may, in all these positions the same basic motive is at work: the person resists being leveled down and worn out by a social-technological mechanism. An inquiry into the inner meaning of specifically modern life and its products, into the soul of the cultural body, so to speak, must seek to solve the equation which structures like the metropolis set up between the individual and the super-individual contents of life.|sign=[[Georg Simmel]]|source="The Metropolis and Mental Life"}}

Writing in 1962, [[Cornelia Otis Skinner]] suggested that there was no English equivalent of the term: "there is no Anglo-Saxon counterpart of that essentially Gallic individual, the deliberately aimless pedestrian, unencumbered by any obligation or sense of urgency, who, being French and therefore frugal, wastes nothing, including his time which he spends with the leisurely discrimination of a gourmet, savoring the multiple flavors of his city."&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornelia Otis Skinner]], ''Elegant Wits and Grand Horizontals'', 1962, Houghton Mifflin, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture and urban planning==
The concept of the ''flâneur'' has also become meaningful in [[architecture]] and [[urban planning]], describing people who are indirectly and unintentionally affected by a particular design they experience only in passing.

In 1917, the Swiss writer [[Robert Walser (writer)|Robert Walser]] published a short story called "Der Spaziergang" ("The Walk"), a veritable outcome of the flâneur literature.

[[Walter Benjamin]] adopted the concept of the urban observer both as an analytical tool and as a lifestyle. From his [[Marxism|Marxist]] standpoint, Benjamin describes the ''flâneur'' as a product of modern life and the [[Industrial Revolution]] without precedent, a parallel to the advent of the [[tourism|tourist]]. His ''flâneur'' is an uninvolved but highly perceptive [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] dilettante. Benjamin became his own prime example, making social and aesthetic observations during long walks through Paris. Even the title of his unfinished ''[[Arcades Project]]'' comes from his affection for covered shopping streets.

{{quote|text=The crowd was the veil from behind which the familiar city as phantasmagoria beckoned to the ''flâneur''. In it, the city was now landscape, now a room. And both of these went into the construction of the department store, which made use of ''flânerie'' itself in order to sell goods. The department store was the ''flâneur's'' final coup. As ''flâneurs'', the intelligensia came into the market place. As they thought, to observe it—but in reality it was already to find a buyer. In this intermediary stage [...] they took the form of the bohème. To the uncertainty of their economic position corresponded the uncertainty of their political function.|sign=Walter Benjamin|source="Paris: the capital of the nineteenth century" (1935), in ''Charles Baudelaire: a lyric poet in the era of high capitalism''}}

In the context of modern-day architecture and urban planning, designing for ''flâneurs'' is one way to approach issues{{which|date=March 2014}} of the psychological aspects of the built environment.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Photography==
The ''flâneur's'' tendency toward detached but aesthetically attuned observation has brought the term into the literature of photography, particularly [[street photography]]. The street photographer is seen as one modern extension of the urban observer described by nineteenth century journalist Victor Fournel before the advent of the hand-held camera:

{{quote|text=This man is a roving and impassioned [[daguerreotype]] that preserves the least traces, and on which are reproduced, with their changing reflections, the course of things, the movement of the city, the multiple physiognomy of the public spirit, the confessions, antipathies, and admirations of the crowd.
|sign=Victor Fournel|source=''Ce qu'on voit dans les rues de Paris'' (''What One Sees on the Streets of Paris'')}}

The most notable application of ''flâneur'' to street photography probably comes from [[Susan Sontag]] in her 1977 collection of essays, ''[[On Photography]]''. She describes how, since the development of hand-held cameras in the early 20th century, the camera has become the tool of the ''flâneur'':

{{quote|text=The photographer is an armed version of the solitary walker reconnoitering, stalking, cruising the urban inferno, the voyeuristic stroller who discovers the city as a landscape of voluptuous extremes. Adept of the joys of watching, connoisseur of empathy, the flâneur finds the world "picturesque."|sign=[[Susan Sontag]]|source=''On Photography'', p. 55}}

==Other uses==
The flâneur concept is not limited to someone committing the physical act of a peripatetic stroll in the Baudelairian sense, but can also include a "complete philosophical way of living and thinking", and a process of navigating erudition as described by [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]]'s essay on "why I walk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taleb|first=Nassim Nicholas|origyear=2007|year=2010|title=The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable|location=New York|publisher=Random House|edition=2nd|isbn=978-1-4000-6351-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taleb further set this term with a positive connotation referring to anyone pursuing open, flexible plans, in opposition to the negative "touristification", which he defines as the pursuit of an overly orderly plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taleb|first=Nassim Nicholas|origyear=2007|year=2010|title=Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder|location=New York|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0812979688}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis Menand, in seeking to describe the poet [[T.S. Eliot]]'s relationship to English literary society and his role in the formation of modernism, describes Eliot as a flâneur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Practical Cat|journal=The New Yorker|date=September 19, 2011|pages=81–89?|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/09/19/practical-cat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in one of Eliot's well-known poems "The Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock", the protagonist takes the reader for a journey through his city in the manner of a flâneur.

In "[[De Profundis (letter)|De Profundis]]", [[Oscar Wilde]] writes from prison about his life regrets, stating "I let myself be lured into long spells of senseless and sensual ease. I amused myself with being a flaneur, a dandy, a man of fashion. I surrounded myself with the smaller natures and the meaner minds."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Wilde |first=Oscar |title=[[De Profundis (letter)|De Profundis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish music journalist and writer Pat Carty occasionally uses the title ''Le Flâneur''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pat Carty, Contributor Bio|journal=Hot Press|url=http://www.hotpress.com/authors/author_bio.php?id=19788129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Harem Conspiracy''' was a plot to murder the Egyptian pharaoh [[Ramesses III]]. The principal figure behind the plot was one of the pharaoh's secondary wives, [[Tiye (20th dynasty)|Tiye]], who hoped to put her son [[Pentawere]] on the throne instead of the heir [[Ramesses IV]]. The plan was organized by the court official [[Pebekkamen]]. The plot was apparently successful in causing the death of the pharaoh, but failed in its main objective of establishing Pentawere on the throne. In the aftermath, the leading conspirators were convicted and executed.

==Ramesses III==
{{Details|Ramesses III}}
[[Ramesses III]] was born during the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]] to his father Pharaoh [[Setnakhte]] and mother Queen [[Tiy-merenese]]. His father Setnakhte came to the throne by rescuing [[Egypt]] from the hands of foreign powers. After [[Ramesses II]] or Ramesses The Great outlived twelve of his sons, Egypt was put in the hands of others. Setnakhte led Egypt into the Twentieth Dynasty. It is said that Ramesses III "entered life destined for the kingship and remained at the pinnacle of society and power throughout".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Redford|first=Susan|title=The Harem Conspiracy|year=2002|publisher=Northern Illinois Press|location=|isbn=|pp=XXIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramesses III ruled Egypt for 32 years before his life was cut short. He had recently relocated to [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] to celebrate the [[Heb-Sed]], the rejuvenation festival that occurs after a king rules for thirty years and it continues to take place every three years thereafter. It was in Thebes where this great conspiracy was performed.&lt;ref&gt;Redford, pp. I-XXIV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy==
[[File:M-Ramses IV.jpg|thumb|130px|Ramesses IV, the appointed heir of Ramesses III]]
In early April 1155 BC, Ramesses III was enjoying an evening in the royal [[harem]] when an attempt on his life was made. One of the king's wives, Queen [[Tiye (20th dynasty)|Tiye]], wished for her son, [[Pentawere]], to take the throne over [[Ramesses IV]]; to effect this she had to remove Ramesses III as well as Ramesses IV. Tiye enlisted a group of officials throughout the administration as well as servants to help deliver messages beyond the harem. Tiye was also able to convince many of these officials to help act out the two-fold conspiracy. One of the pantry chiefs, [[Pebekkamen]], was given the responsibility of becoming Tiye's ally as well as moving much of the information around. Pebekkamen received help from a butler named Mastesuria, the cattle overseer Panhayboni, and two administrators named Panouk and Pentua. Since the harem had very restricted access Panhayboni sought out the overseer of the King's treasury, Pairy, to gain access to the harem.

The conspirators believed that their plot would be aided by the use of [[black magic]] to deceive the guards at the harem and to allow certain messages to be delivered. Magical spells were also used to make Ramesses III more vulnerable, making him an easy target for assassination. The plotters enlisted the court magician Prekamenef and Ramesses III's personal physician Iyroy to conjure the magic. Spells and incantations were performed while the attempt to take the life of Ramesses III was happening.

There has been some dispute about how Ramesses was killed. It was once thought that poison was the most likely weapon, as the king seems to have survived the initial attack, only to die some days later. Recent study of his mummy, however, strongly suggests that Ramesses III's throat was cut, as revealed by a [[CAT scan]].&lt;ref name="BMJ"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hawass |first=Zahi |last2=Ismail |first2=Somaia |last3=Selim |first3=Ashraf |last4=Saleem |first4=Sahar N. |last5=Fathalla |first5=Dina |last6=Wasef |first6=Sally |last7=Gad |first7=Ahmed Z. |last8=Saad |first8=Rama |last9=Fares |first9=Suzan |last10=Amer |first10=Hany |last11=Gostner |first11=Paul |last12=Gad |first12=Yehia Z. |last13=Pusch |first13=Carsten M. |last14=Zink |first14=Albert R. |display-authors=2 |date=December 17, 2012 |title=Revisiting the harem conspiracy and death of Ramesses III: anthropological, forensic, radiological,and genetic study |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e8268 |journal=BMJ |publisher=BMJ Publishing Group Ltd. |volume=345 |pages=e8268 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.e8268 |access-date=8 February 2016 |pmid=23247979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the attack on his father, the heir Ramesses IV quickly took control. The conspirators were unable to muster the support needed to oust the heir. Ramesses picked twelve [[magistrate]]s to investigate and judge the case.  The [[Judicial Papyrus of Turin]], the main source of information for this event, is the court document, which states the outcome of the case for each conspirator. The document includes the punishment of seven magistrates who were [[blackmail|blackmailed]] by military associates into betraying the king. They were also caught and charged.

==Judicial Papyrus of Turin==
{{Details|Judicial Papyrus of Turin}}
[[File:Papyrus judicial Turin.jpg|thumb|The Judicial Papyrus. Turin, [[Museo Egizio]]]]
The [[Judicial Papyrus of Turin]] is the main source of evidence that the harem conspiracy occurred. Written over 3,000 years ago, it is one of the few surviving papyri relating to the event. The Papyrus is a combination of several papyri, the Papyrus Rollin, Papyrus Varzy, Papyrus Lee, Papyrus Rifaud and Papyrus Rifaud II. The text was originally separated by a [[thief]] who carefully cut the document, making sure to not do much damage to the text itself.&lt;ref&gt;Redford, pp. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt; The Judicial Papyrus was completely translated in 1937 by A. de Buck. There are multiple translations of the Judicial Papyrus of Turin, but most authors still refer to de Buck's translation. The document contains the entire list of those who participated in the [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]], as well as their [[verdict]] and [[punishment]] they received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Buck |first=A.|title=The Judicial Papyrus of Turin |jstor=3854420|journal=JEA |publisher=Egyptian Exploration Society|year=1937|volume=23|issue=2 |pages=152–164 |doi=10.2307/3854420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Judicial Papyrus of Turin captures the situation in Egypt at the time, as well as many cultural tendencies. The Judicial Papyrus of Turin by Ramesses III says: "As for the statements which the people made, I don't know anything about them. Proceed. And they will go and they will examine them and they will allow the one whom they would put to death to die by their own hands" (2:6–2:7). The passage describes how it is not the magistrates' or the king's responsibility that the conspirators had to be killed, it was the conspirators' fault. Further in the text it describes how some of the great criminals will have their punishments executed upon them but it also discusses how some conspirators, including Pentawere, [[Suicide|take their own life]]. Overall the Judicial Papyrus of Turin contains a list of 27 men and 6 women who were charged with [[high treason]], 5 men charged with [[corruption]]. Historians do not know what happened to Queen Tiye. Her son may have committed suicide, but nothing is known about the outcome of her trial or even if she had one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vernus|first=Pascal|title=Affairs and Scandals in Ancient Egypt|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=|isbn=|pp=109–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Union of Socialist Youth''' ('''IUSY''') is an international organization, founded in 1907, whose activities include publications, support of member organizations and the organization of meetings. It was formed as the youth wing of the [[Second International]] under the name Socialist Youth International. IUSY now has 145 member organisations - including 122 full members and 23 observer members - from 106 countries.&lt;ref name="iusy-home"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iusy.org/category/home/memberorganisations/|title=International Union of Socialist Youth|author=International Union of Socialist Youth|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; IUSY gained status as an international youth NGO with UN ECOSOC consultative status in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=List of non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council as of 1 September 2011|url=http://csonet.org/content/documents/E2011INF4.pdf|publisher=Economic and Social Council, United Nations|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On 24–27 August 1907, a meeting of 20 youth representatives from 13 countries met in the German city of [[Stuttgart]] and founded the Socialist Youth International as the youth organization of the Second International.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite book | author = JUSOS &amp; Die Falken | title = 100 Years of Struggle for Peace and Equality | date = August 2007|place=Berlin|page= 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its international office was located in Vienna and it has remained there to this day except for a few brief extraordinary periods.

The socialist youth organizations, just like their mother parties, were confronted by the growing influence of nationalism and militarism in Europe. When the First World War broke out in 1914, even though the vast majority of the socialist parties openly supported their country's war efforts, the Socialist Youth International remained steadfast in their principled opposition to war and militarism.&lt;ref name="chambers"&gt;{{cite book | author = JUSOS &amp; Die Falken | title = 100 Years of Struggle for Peace and Equality | date = August 2007|place=Berlin|page= 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization had to move its offices to [[Zurich]] and from there it published its journal, ''Youth International'', calling for peace, which had to be distributed illegally given the circumstances. The struggle for peace subsequently became a hallmark of the socialist youth organization.

The formation of [[Communist International|the Communist International]] in [[Moscow]] in 1919 officially split the worker's and youth movement into two sides. The representatives of the socialist and social-democratic current reconvened the International Socialist Youth Movement in 1921.

In 1925, in the wake of the fascist takeover of Italy, the youth organization from the country was forced to stop participating in the work of the ISYM. This marked the beginning of the organization's fight against fascism.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite book | first = Sven | last = Frye (ed.) | title = !00 Years of International Socialist Youth, Struggle for Peace and Equality in the World | publisher = vorwarts buch | date = 2007|page= 29 | displayauthors = et al }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, the Berlin office was evacuated to Prague.

After the Second World War, on 30 September 1946, at the congress in Paris the organization formally became known as the International Union of Socialist Youth. It began to accept a growing number of youth organizations from outside of Europe and by the beginning of the 1950s IUSY included 73 member organizations from 50 countries. Since that time, the organization has more than doubled.

Following the Paris congress and up through the 1960s, IUSY focused on supporting decolonisation efforts and struggles for independence, especially in Africa and Asia.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book | first = Sven | last = Frye (ed.) | title = !00 Years of International Socialist Youth, Struggle for Peace and Equality in the World | publisher = vorwarts buch | date = 2007|place=Berlin|page =37 | displayauthors = et al }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the organization was active in drawing attention to the human rights violations by military governments in South America and building up international solidarity campaigns, especially against Pinochet in Chile and Somoza in Nicaragua.

IUSY was cautiously supportive of the democratization process in Eastern Europe because the organization wanted these changes to benefit the general population, not just a tiny elite. Although the nuclear arms race ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the transition from authoritarian regimes has brought about new conflicts in these regions. Human trafficking and refugees, resulting from civil conflicts, became the new focus of efforts on the part of IUSY. IUSY formed the Balkan Roundtable and Black Sea Area Committees to facilitate dialogue and cooperation among the different countries.

Looking towards the future, there remains much work to be done. IUSY is committed to working with the member youth organizations to develop effective tools for the treatment and prevention of the HIV-AIDS pandemic. The advancement of individual human rights and liberties in many places is a special concern. The recent events have highlighted the basic economic inequality that exists throughout the world and drawn attention to the struggle for social justice and equality.

==Activities==
IUSY's main field of activity is in the promotion of democracy, human rights, and youth policy. IUSY works by engaging international institutions, such as the Council of Europe, United Nations, Socialist International, European Youth Forum, and others, and directly targeting policy makers and media representatives at an international level to advocate for equal opportunities and the right to social and political participation for youth all over the world. Furthermore, IUSY trains activists at the grassroots level in the international political debate and policy development by organizing conferences and supporting political campaigns and initiatives on a regional and global level.

IUSY works to strengthen its member organizations by providing a broad network of support and facilitating educational workshops and training seminars, aimed at increasing their capacity to fight for political change in their respective countries.

The IUSY Congress is the highest decision-making body within the organization. It elects the President, the Secretary General, the Presidium and the Control Commission. The IUSY Congress and IUSY Council take place every second year on an alternating basis. The IUSY coordinates its activities on two levels – regional and global. 

The global Presidium is composed of the President, the Secretary General and 19 Vice-Presidents, who meet regularly to discuss and develop policy.

The IUSY has five regional committees – American, African, Asian-Pacific, European, and Mediterranean – that meet annually. Also, IUSY has two permanent working groups – Feminism and LGBT – that deal with issues involving those specific themes.

The IUSY Secretariat, led by the Secretary General, organizes all activities and is responsible for finances, communication, and the daily work of the organization. IUSY's working languages are English, French, and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;IUSY Statues - http://iusy.org/category/home/documents/iusy-statues/&lt;/ref&gt;

The IUSY World Festival brings together activists and is organized approximately every two or three years.

'''Jewish Voice for Labour''' ('''JVL''') is an organisation for [[British Jews|Jewish]] members of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. It was formed in 2017 as an alternative to the [[Jewish Labour Movement]]&lt;ref name="Sugarman"/&gt; with the stated aims being to "tackle allegations of [[Antisemitism in the UK Labour Party|antisemitism in the Labour Party]]",&lt;ref name="Welch"/&gt; "to uphold the right of supporters of justice for Palestinians to engage in solidarity activities" and "opposing attempts to widen the definition of antisemitism beyond its meaning of hostility towards, or discrimination against, Jews as Jews."&lt;ref name="Sugarman"/&gt;

==Premise and organisation==

Such manifestations draw on stereotypes – characteristics which all Jews are presumed to share."&lt;ref name="timesofisrael"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/jewish-voice-for-labour-offer-new-anti-semitism-definition/|title=Jewish Voice for Labour offer new anti-Semitism definition|work= |location= |publisher=''[[Jewish News]]''|date=17 May 2018|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, JVL said in a statement about Labour's code of conduct that defines antisemitism which was adopted by the [[National Executive Committee]] (NEC) for the purposes of disciplinary cases brought before the National Constitutional Committee that it "offers a constructive framework for moving forward in this difficult area" and it encouraged "free speech on issues to do with Israel and its treatment of the Palestinians, and with Zionism" but "much will depend on how this code of conduct is applied in practice, particularly in disciplinary cases.

In August, JVL complained to the [[BBC]] director-general [[Tony Hall, Baron Hall of Birkenhead|Baron Tony Hall]] and news and current affairs director [[Francesca Unsworth]] by criticising and demonstrating against the BBC's "lack of impartiality and inaccuracies" and "biased" coverage of Labour MP [[Margaret Hodge]]'s allegations of antisemitism against Jeremy Corbyn.&lt;ref name="Sabin"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sabin|first=Lamiat|url=https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/article/bbcs-‘lack-impartiality-and-inaccuracies’-reporting-hodges-claims-against-corbyn-condemned|title=BBC cornered over 'biased' coverage of anti-semitism row|work= |location= |publisher=''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]]''|date=7 August 2018|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blakelock"&gt;{{cite news |last=Blakelock|first=Pamela|url=https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/article/letter-bbc-about-biased-and-inaccurate-reporting-anti-semitism-allegations-towards-jeremy-0|title=Letter to the BBC about biased and inaccurate reporting of anti-semitism allegations towards Jeremy Corbyn|work= |location= |publisher=''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]]''|date=7 August 2018|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, JVL jointly with Free Speech on Israel published a declaration on antisemitic misconduct.&lt;ref name="MansonLevane"/&gt; JVL contributed to the consultation on Labour's code of conduct rejecting suggestions that comparisons between Israel and "features of pre-war [[Nazi Germany]]" or [[apartheid]]-era South Africa were "inherently antisemitic", arguing that "Drawing such parallels can undoubtedly cause offence; but potent historical events and experiences are always key reference points in political debate. Such comparisons are only anti-Semitic if they show prejudice, hostility or hatred against Jews as Jews."&lt;ref name="jewishnews"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/expelled-activist-tells-jvl-meeting-that-witchhunt-is-plot-to-topple-corbyn/|title=Expelled activist tells JVL meeting that ‘witchhunt’ is plot to ‘topple’ Corbyn|work= |location= |publisher=''[[Jewish News]]''|date=25 September 2018|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their guidelines on antisemitism include questions of Israel and Zionism such as "Jews, Israelis and Zionists are separate categories that are too frequently conflated by both supporters and critics of Israel. This conflation can be anti-Semitic. Holding all Jews responsible for the actions of the Israeli government is anti-Semitic. Many Jews are not Zionist."&lt;ref name="Gill"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gill|first=Joe|url=https://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/h-did-you-hear-about-anti-semitic-bomb-threat-labour-conference-1771265636|title=Labour bomb threat: When pro-Palestine Jews are targeted, the media is silent|work= |location= |publisher=''[[Middle East Eye]]''|date=1 October 2018|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation also questioned whether "discussion and education, rather than a formal disciplinary approach" could be more appropriate in some cases of antisemitism.&lt;ref name="jewishnews"/&gt;

In September, at the [[Labour Party Conference (UK)#2018_Liverpool|Labour Party Conference]], JVL hosted two fringe events: "Israel/Palestine: Antisemitism" and "Fighting The Far Right".&lt;ref name="Chaplain"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chaplain|first=Chloe|url=https://www.inews.co.uk/news/politics/labour-party-conference-highlights-schedule-full-events-world-transformed/|title=Labour party conference highlights: The essential details of the event in Liverpool|work= |location= |publisher=''[[iNews]]''|date=21 September 2018|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; JVL also organised and hosted the premier of the documentary film ''The Political Lynching of Jackie Walker'' where 200 people were evacuated after a bomb threat.&lt;ref name="ThomasKirkham"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thomas|first1=Joe|last2=Kirkham|first2=Jenny|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/film-screening-hosted-jewish-voices-15200721|title=Labour party conference highlights: The essential details of the event in Liverpool|work= |location=Liverpool|publisher=''[[Liverpool Echo]]''|date=25 September 2018|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rawlinson"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rawlinson|first=Kevin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/25/jewish-event-at-labour-conference-abandoned-after-bomb-scare|title=Jewish event at Labour conference abandoned after bomb scare|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=25 September 2018|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement the organisation said the film "is an incisive and chilling exposé of attempts to silence critics of Israel, in particular those who support the socialist project of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.

'''Kurt Patrick Wise''' (born 1959) is an American [[young Earth creationism|young earth creationist]] who serves as the Director of Creation Research Center at [[Truett McConnell University]]. He has a PhD in [[paleontology]] from [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/magazine/25wwln-geologists-t.html?mcubz=1| title=Rock of Ages, Ages of Rock |publisher=[[New York Times Magazine]] | year=1998 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He writes in support of creationism and works for the [[Creation Museum]].

==Biography==
In 1989, Wise earned a Ph.D. in [[paleontology]] from [[Harvard University]]. In addition, he has an M.A. in [[geology]] from Harvard University and a B.A. Geology from the [[University of Chicago]]. In 1998, [[Robert Schadewald]] described Wise as influential on "modern creationism as it is practiced at its higher levels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/rncse/18/3/1998-international-conference-creationism | title=The 1998 International Conference on Creationism |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] | year=1998 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in fall 2009 he has been the director of [[Truett McConnell University]]'s newly created Creation Research Center in [[Cleveland, Georgia]].&lt;ref name="Truett-McConnellAnnouncement"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.truett.edu/article-list/428-creation-research-center-established-at-tmc.html | title=Creation Research Center has been established | publisher=[[Truett-McConnell College]] | year=2009 | first= | last= | accessdate=2014-04-09 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413145602/http://www.truett.edu/article-list/428-creation-research-center-established-at-tmc.html | archivedate=2014-04-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between August 2006 and May 2009 he taught at [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]] as director of the school's Center for Theology and Science, a job in which he was preceded by [[intelligent design]] advocate [[William Dembski]].&lt;ref name=sbts&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sbts.edu/academics/Faculty/Theology/Kurt_Wise.aspx  | title=Kurt P.

He served as consultant to the [[Answers in Genesis]] [[Creation Museum]] which opened in 2007.&lt;ref name=heaton&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/rncse/27/1-2/visit-to-new-creation-museum | title=A Visit to the New Creation 'Museum' |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] | year=2007 | first=Timothy | last=Heaton | accessdate = 2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timothy H. Heaton]], another scientist who studied under [[Stephen Jay Gould]], knows Wise as "a less propaganda-oriented creationist" than [[Ken Ham]], the leader of Answers in Genesis, and said that Wise's influence on the displays was apparent.&lt;ref name=heaton/&gt;

==Views and criticism==
Wise has said he believes, according to a [[Biblical literalism|literal reading of the Bible]], "that the earth is young, and the universe is young, I would suggest that it's less than ten thousand years in age."  He believes that science can be used to support and demonstrate these claims.&lt;ref name=telling&gt;"[http://www.abc.net.au/science/kelvin/files/s194.htm 'Telling Lies for God'? One Man's Crusade]". ''Quantum''. July 17, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite believing that science supports his position, Wise has written that:
{{quote|Although there are scientific reasons for accepting a young earth, I am a young age creationist because that is my understanding of the Scripture. As I shared with my professors years ago when I was in college, if all the evidence in the universe turns against creationism, I would be the first to admit it, but I would still be a creationist because that is what the Word of God seems to indicate.&lt;ref name=six&gt;Kurt Wise. [http://creationontheweb.com/content/view/4044/ ''In Six Days: Why 50 Scientists Choose to Believe in Creation'']. John Ashton, Ed. Accessed May 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
As a young child interested in science, Wise tentatively adopted an [[old Earth creationism|old Earth creationist]] point of view after doing a science fair project on the [[geologic column]], but was not completely satisfied with that decision:

{{quote|What nagged me was that even if the days were long periods of time, the order was still out of whack. After all, science said the sun came before the earth—or at least at the same time—and the Bible said that the earth came three days before the sun. Whereas science said that the sea creatures came before plants and the land creatures came before flying creatures, the Bible indicated that plants preceded sea creatures and flying creatures preceded land creatures. On the other hand, making the days millions of years long seemed to take away most of the conflict. I thus determined to shelve these problems in the back recesses of my mind. It didn't work. Over the next couple of years, the conflict of order nagged me.&lt;ref name=six/&gt;}}

Later, as a sophomore in high school, he took a newly purchased Bible and a pair of scissors and cut out every verse which could not be interpreted literally if scientific determinations on the [[age of the earth]] and [[evolution]] were true.  He pursued this task with a flashlight under the covers of his bed for several months; at the end, he had removed so much material that "with the cover of the Bible taken off, I attempted to physically lift the Bible from the bed between two fingers. Yet, try as I might, and even with the benefit of intact margins throughout the pages of Scripture, I found it impossible to pick up the Bible without it being rent in two."&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;  Wise decided to reject evolution instead of Biblical literalism, deciding:

{{quote|...that the rejection of evolution does not necessarily involve the rejection of all of science. In fact, I have come to learn that science owes its very existence and rationale to the claims of Scripture. On the other hand, I have also learned that evolution is not the only claim of modern science which must be rejected if Scripture is assumed to be true.&lt;ref name=six/&gt;}}

Biologist and popular [[atheism|atheist]] author [[Richard Dawkins]] called Wise a truly honest creationist because he is willing to accept creationism even if he admitted "all the evidence in the universe" was against it.&lt;ref name="Dawkins"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://scepsis.net/eng/articles/id_2.php | title=Sadly, an Honest Creationist | publisher=[[Scepsis]] | year=2001 | first=Richard | last=Dawkins | accessdate=2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins, referring to Wise's testimony, criticized what he perceived as [[intellectual dishonesty]]:

{{quote|Kurt Wise doesn't need the challenge; he volunteers that, even if all the evidence in the universe flatly contradicted Scripture, and even if he had reached the point of admitting this to himself, he would still take his stand on Scripture and deny the evidence. This leaves me, as a scientist, speechless... We have it on the authority of a man who may well be creationism's most highly qualified and most intelligent scientist that no evidence, no matter how overwhelming, no matter how all-embracing, no matter how devastatingly convincing, can ever make any difference.&lt;ref name="Dawkins"/&gt;}}

===Paul Weston arrest===

Weston is a former [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) candidate who left that party over what he described as its failure to address issues related to [[Islam in the United Kingdom|Islam in Britain]], and then joined the [[British Freedom Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10792895/Election-candidate-arrested-over-Churchill-speech.html |title=Election candidate arrested over Churchill speech |first=Martin |last=Evan |date=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's candidate was Jack Buckby, who was a member of the youth division of the [[British National Party]] (BNP) under [[Nick Griffin]] before leaving the party. He says he left because he believed that the BNP was too racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cowburn|first1=Ashley|title=Jo Cox: Liberty GB Move to Contest Labour MP's Former Seat Branded 'Obscene' and 'Contemptible'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jo-cox-death-labour-mp-seat-batley-and-spen-by-election-liberty-gb-bnp-jack-buckby-a7091141.html|website=www.independent.co.uk|accessdate=21 June 2016|date=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buckby polled just over 1% of the vote; he lost his deposit, as did all the candidates except the winner, the Labour candidate [[Tracy Brabin]].

==Later career==

In 1944 Louise McLaren moved to [[New York City]] where she served as organizer for the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] Political Action committee. She held various positions eventually retiring from a teaching and research position with the American Labor Education Service. She was part of a network of reform-minded women that met in the 1920s and later became academic social scientists (including Marie Algor, [[Hilda Worthington Smith|Hilda (Jane) Smith]], Mary C. Barker, Ernestine Friedmann, Alice Shoemaker, Amy Bruce, and Eleanor G. Coit). Some were former YWCA industrial and executive secretaries whom went on to establish summer schools, taught workers' education programs, did research and field work, and also held seminars and conferences for workers' education. Throughout the years of cooperative work in the field they managed to stay in touch and this resulted in lasting friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch00224|title=Coit, Eleanor G. Papers, 1894-1971: A Finding Aid|work=harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She died in East Stroudsburg, Pa. in 1968 of heart disease at age 83. She had a vision of industrial society and with an unfailing sense of optimism and with hard work and dedication inspired several generations of southern working women.

A '''military imposter''' is a person who makes false claims about his or her [[military service]] in civilian life.&lt;ref name="Holzer2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Mark Holzer|title=Fake Warriors: Identifying, Exposing, and Punishing Those Who Falsify Their Military Service|date=August 9, 2012|publisher=Madison Press|isbn=978-0985243784}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SternerPam2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sterner, Doug|author2=Sterner, Pam|title=Restoring Valor: One Couple's Mission to Expose Fraudulent War Heroes and Protect America's Military Awards System|date=February 4, 2014|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Company, Incorporated|isbn=978-1626365513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbsn_Fake"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Fake War Stories Exposed | author =  | work = cbsnews.com | date = 11 November 2005 | accessdate = 2015-04-07 | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fake-war-stories-exposed/ | language =   | quote = Civil War }}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes claims by people that have never been in the military as well as lies or embellishments by genuine veterans. Some individuals who do this also wear privately obtained uniforms or medals which were never officially issued to them.

In British military slang, such imposters are called "Walts", based on [[James Thurber|James Thurber's]] fictional character, [[Walter Mitty#British military slang|Walter Mitty]], who daydreamed of being a war hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Homeless Veterans appeal: UK needs new law to stop ‘Walter Mittys’ posing as war heroes | work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/campaigns/homeless-veterans/homeless-veterans-appeal-uk-needs-new-law-to-stop-walter-mittys-posing-as-war-heroes-10014591.html?origin=internalSearch | date=30 January 2015 | accessdate=30 January 2015 | author=Green Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[United States]] since the early 2000s, the term "stolen valor" has become popular slang for this kind of behavior, so named for the 1998 [[Stolen Valor|book of that name]].&lt;ref name="Burkett1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard Gary Burkett|title=Stolen Valor: How the Vietnam Generation was Robbed of Its Heroes and Its History|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Verity Press|isbn=978-0-9667036-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other terms include "fake warriors",&lt;ref name="fake_THEF"/&gt; "military phonies",&lt;ref name="GehringPPPQ"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Phonies, Fakes, and Frauds - and the Social Harms They Cause |journal=Philosophy and Public Policy Quarterly |year=2003 |last=Gehring |first=Verna V. |volume=23 |issue=1/2 |url=http://journals.gmu.edu/PPPQ/article/view/395 |accessdate=2015-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "medal cheats",&lt;ref name="anzm_Home"/&gt;and "military posers".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guardianofvalor.com|title=Guardian Of Valor|website=Guardian Of Valor|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lying about military service or wearing a uniform or medals that were not earned is criminalized in some circumstances, especially if done with the goal of obtaining money or any other kind of tangible benefit, though laws vary by country.&lt;ref name="medals"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8454715.stm | title=Is it illegal to wear medals you weren't awarded? | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=13 January 2010 | accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behaviors==
Military impostors engage in a broad range of deceptive behaviors, all intended to achieve recognition from others. An impostor may make verbal statements, written claims, or create deceptive impressions through actions, such as wearing a uniform, rank insignia, unit symbols, medals, or patches.&lt;ref name="Holzer2003"/&gt;  

Generally impostors fall into two broad categories: civilians who have never been in any branch of the military, and real veterans who make false claims exaggerating their experiences or accomplishments. Impostors in the latter category may claim any of the following:  

* Being the recipient of awards that were not earned
* Having a longer service duration
* Having a more favorable [[Military discharge|discharge]]
* Holding a higher rank than one actually held
* Having served with a different branch of the military
* Having served with a different unit that is more famous
* Being a different role or [[Military Occupational Specialty]]
* Involvement in a war or specific engagement one was not present for
* Performing a brave or valorous act that never happened
* Participation in "[[special forces|special]]" or "[[black ops|secret]]" operations
* Being a [[prisoner of war]] (POW).&lt;ref name="nbcn_AP:M"&gt;{{Cite web | title = AP: More POW claimants than actual POWs | author =  | work = msnbc.com | date =  | accessdate = 2015-04-07 | url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/30168352/ns/us_news-military/t/ap-more-pow-claimants-actual-pows/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many individuals outright fabricate some or all of their military service history, others employ [[equivocation]] tactics or similarly misleading language that avoids making a technically false statement, but still gives a deceptive impression. A common example is stating one was in a branch of the military during a specific war. In many contexts, such a statement ''implies'' that the speaker was deployed to a combat zone, even if in reality never left their home country. A similar misleading statement is boasting about being a member of a branch or unit that is well known for its combat prowess and heroic achievements, when the speaker was purely in a logistical role without any combat experience. Imposters also frequently claim to be part of "[[Classified information|classified]]" operations as an excuse for why they cannot provide details or, when confronted, why there is no record of their actions or service.&lt;ref name="app._Staf"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Stafford mayor's 'stolen valor' problem | author = Erik Larsen  | work = Asbury Park Press | date = 13 February 2015 | accessdate = 2015-04-03 | url = http://www.app.com/story/news/local/ocean-county/2015/02/13/stafford-mayors-stolen-valor-problem/23390119/ | quote = He told people, including reporters, that he had been sent on secret missions as a self-described "spook," and that his true service record remained classified 40 years after the war. When asked how he could acknowledge being a spy if his service record was still classified, he simply stopped talking about the matter. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations==
Reasons for posing as a member of the military or exaggerating one's service record vary, but the intent is almost always about gaining the respect and admiration of others.&lt;ref name="Holzer2003"/&gt;  Philosophy professor Verna V. Gehring describes such people as "virtue imposters," in that they don't necessarily adopt the identity of another person, but instead adopt a false history for themselves to impersonate virtues and characteristics.&lt;ref name="GehringPPPQ"/&gt;  Many are only motivated by social recognition, attempting to exploit the reverence and respect for veterans in their country. These individuals often become absorbed in a [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] of being a veteran that they attempt to live out in real life, sometimes even inserting themselves into public events or ceremonies, or volunteering for interviews with journalists about their alleged experiences.&lt;ref name="Holzer2003"/&gt; Others are motivated by more direct gains, such as impressing employers, casting directors, audiences, investors, voters in political campaigns or romantic interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fantasist wore haul of fake medals on Remembrance Day march 'to impress his young wife' |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=13 January 2010 |accessdate=29 April 2015 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1242608/Fantasist-Roger-Day-wore-haul-fake-medals-Remembrance-Day-march-impress-young-wife.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally imposters use their claims in an attempt to intimidate others, such as claiming to be a trained sniper or ex-special forces, or use their fabricated experiences as a [[argument from authority|pretense of authority]] for their opinions on political matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brian Ross and Vic Walter|title=Anti-War YouTube 'Vet' Admits He Is Faker|publisher=ABC News|date=September 21, 2007|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/09/anti-war-youtub.html|accessdate=2007-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  False claims of military service are also used by [[panhandlers]] to increase their take, sometimes coupled with real or fake injuries that are implied to be combat-related.&lt;ref name="abc7_Army"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Army veteran confronts Florida panhandler for posing in military uniform | author =  | work = ABC7 Los Angeles | date =  | accessdate = 2015-04-03 | url = http://abc7.com/society/army-veteran-confronts-panhandler-over-stolen-valor/595408/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection==
Military imposters are frequently caught and exposed due to mistakes and inconsistencies in their story or behavior. For example, they may be too young or too old to have been in the war they say they were or too young for the rank they claim to be, might inadvertently claim to have been in two different places at once, or might state factually incorrect information about the war they allegedly were part of. Among imposters that wear uniforms, they often make mistakes about the placement of patches, insignia and medals, and may have some from the wrong branch or from old campaigns they could not possibly have been in.&lt;ref name="just_USAt"&gt;{{Cite web | title = US Attorney's Office - Eastern District of NC | author =  | work = justice.gov | date =  | accessdate = 2015-05-06 | url = http://www.justice.gov/usao/nce/press/2005/2005-Apr-07.html | language =  | quote = The indictment alleges that the Air Force uniform that PHILLIPS wore was decorated with the following military medals and ribbons:...[[European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140115094848/http://www.justice.gov/usao/nce/press/2005/2005-Apr-07.html | archivedate = 2014-01-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Real veterans often can spot mistakes more readily, especially if they were part of the same branch the imposter claims to have been in.&lt;ref name="fox6_Stol"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Stolen valor?

Some countries have ways of verifying military service and certain claims within it. In the United States, any real veteran that has been separated from the military for any reason has a [[DD Form 214]] they can present, which indicates their branch, rank, unit, [[Military Occupational Specialty|MOS]], awards, and other information. Alternatively, requests can also be made to the [[National Personnel Records Center]] using the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] to verify service. Other claims can be verified against public lists, such as recipients of the [[Medal of Honor]] or the [[prisoner of war]] list from the [[Vietnam War]]. Several websites are specifically devoted to verifying the claims of alleged military imposters, and if discovered to have lied, proceed to shame the perpetrator publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guardianofvalor.com|title=Guardian Of Valor|website=Guardian Of Valor|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fake_THEF"&gt;{{Cite web | title = The Fake WarriorsS Project | author = Henry Mark Holzer, Erika Holzer | work = fakewarriors.org | date =  | accessdate = 2015-04-03 | url = http://www.fakewarriors.org/ | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anzm_Home"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Australian &amp; New Zealand Military Imposters (ANZMI) | author =  | work = anzmi.net | date =  | accessdate = 2015-04-29 | url = http://www.anzmi.net/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="this_Stol"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Stolen Valor | author = Jonn Lilyea | work = This ain't Hell, but you can see it from here | date =  | accessdate = 2015-04-03 | url = http://thisainthell.us/blog/?page_id=30655 | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shute"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Shute |first=Joe |date=21 February 2015 |title=The Walter Mitty Hunters exposing fake veterans |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=29 April 2015 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/11425203/The-Walter-Mitty-Hunters-exposing-fake-veterans.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stol_Stol"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Stolen Valour Canada | author =  | work = stolenvalour.ca | date =  | accessdate = 2015-04-29 | url = http://www.stolenvalour.ca/ | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===False accusations===
Accusations do occasionally backfire, with real veterans accused of being imposters.&lt;ref name="CBSLocal"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Sacramento Marine Vet Says He Was Beaten Over Mistaken Case Of Stolen Valor | author =  | work = CBS Sacramento | date =  | accessdate = 2016-06-02 | url = http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2015/10/28/sacramento-marine-vet-says-he-was-beaten-over-mistaken-case-of-stolen-valor/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doug Sterner, a Vietnam War veteran who catalogs military awards, and ''Stolen Valor'' author B.G.

==Criminal laws==
Laws vary between countries regarding false statements about military service and/or wearing of uniforms or medals.

=== United States ===

In the United States, the [[Stolen Valor Act of 2013]] makes it a [[federal offense]] to falsely claim to have received any of several major military awards with the intention of obtaining money, property, or other tangible benefits.&lt;ref name="USlaw18-704"&gt;{{Cite web | title = 18 U.S. Code § 704 - Military medals or decorations {{!}} LII / Legal Information Institute | author =  | work = law.cornell.edu | date =  | accessdate = 2015-05-31 | url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/704 | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are additional laws criminalizing the altering or forging of discharge documents,&lt;ref name="USlaw18-498"&gt;{{Cite web | title = 18 U.S. Code § 498 - Military or naval discharge certificates {{!}} US Law {{!}} LII / Legal Information Institute | author =  | work = law.cornell.edu | date =  | accessdate = 2015-05-31 | url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/498 | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempting to obtain veteran's benefits from the government.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the United Kingdom, it was an offense under the Army Act 1955 to wear real or replica military decorations with intent to deceive.  However, this law was superseded by the [[Armed Forces Act 2006]], which lacks this prohibition.&lt;ref name="Shute" /&gt;  

It is still a crime in the UK for a civilian to wear a uniform of the armed forces without authorization under the Uniforms Act 1894,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK |type=act |year=1894 |act=Uniforms Act |section=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and false claims of military service used to obtain money or other enrichment are prosecuted under the general crime of [[fraud]].&lt;ref name="Shute" /&gt; In November 2016, the [[Defence Select Committee]] recommended making the wearing of unearned medals a criminal offence punishable by up to six months imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bingham |first=John |date=22 November 2016 |title=MPs back new ‘Walter Mitty’ medals law to criminalise ‘military imposters’ |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/22/mps-back-new-walter-mitty-medals-law-criminalise-military-imposters/ |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===

Under the Australia's [[Defence Act|Defence Act, 1903]], as amended, it is a federal crime to falsely claim to be a returned soldier, sailor or airman. It is also a crime to wear any service decoration one has not earned.

=== Canada ===

In Canada, section 419 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] makes it a crime to wear a uniform from the Canadian Forces without authority as well as any awards or marks not earned. It additionally makes it a crime to possess any fraudulent discharge papers, commissions, warrants or military ID, including those that are forged, altered or belong to someone else.&lt;ref name="laws_Crim"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Criminal Code - 419 Unlawful use of military uniforms or certificates | author =  | work = laws.justice.gc.ca | date =  | accessdate = 2015-05-19 | url = http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-200.html#docCont | quote = Canadian Forces }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DeposeAbian.svg|thumb|200px|"Million Voices against Corruption, President Chen Must Go" Campaign logo, with "DEPOSE" slogan]]
'''Million Voices against Corruption, President Chen Must Go''' (百萬人民反貪腐倒扁運動) was a Taiwanese mass campaign led by former [[Democratic Progressive Party]] Chairperson [[Shih Ming-teh]] to pressure [[President of the Republic of China|the Taiwanese President]] [[Chen Shui-bian]] to resign in 2006.

==Background==
Taiwan's political scene is divided into two major groups. On one side are the [[Pan-Blue Coalition|pan-Blues]], consisting of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang, or KMT)]] and two spin-off parties, the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] (PFP), and the [[New Party (Republic of China)|New Party]]. Facing them are the [[Pan-Green Coalition|pan-Greens]], led by the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP), and its ally the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]] (TSU). Since the accession of Chen Shui-bian of the DPP to the Presidency in 2000, the Blue-controlled legislature had struggled to oust him, making changes to the impeachment process early in his administration, and attempting to recall him several times.

The latest round of recalls by the Blue side began in the summer of 2006, following a series of accusations of corruption against Chen and members of the first family. Allegations include [[insider trading]] by Chen's son-in-law, buying and selling of [[Share (finance)|share]]s, and improper use of government funds. The recall motion was defeated due to a lack of votes.

Chen has denied any wrongdoing and not been found guilty by the Taiwanese judicial system. But his approval ratings fell, though the polls that show this is either from pro-Blue news media (which put him at about ~20%) or of completely unsupportable methodology, such as the notorious TSU poll that had him at just 5.8%. Hence, the actual extent of the decline is unknown. There have been calls from within his own party calling for his resignation, since there was some fear among the Greens that the scandals will affect the [[Republic of China legislative election, 2008|legislative election]] and the [[Republic of China presidential election, 2008|Presidential election in 2008]].

The "Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign began in August 2006 when former DPP chairman and long-time democracy and independence activist Shih Ming-te announced that he would launch a protest campaign to force the President to resign. Shih had stepped down as chairman of the DPP in 1995, and began a long political drift from the Green side over to the Blue. According to his own version, he left the DPP in 1999, though party members said they kicked him out in 2000, blaming his grandstanding and repeated public attacks on his colleagues. In 2001 he became convener of a local pro-Blue thinktank called the Mountain Alliance, along with two other DPP turncoats, [[Sisy Chen]] and [[Hsu Hsin-liang]]. He ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Kaohsiung, garnering 1% of the vote, and also lost legislative elections in Taipei, both times running against DPP candidates. Shih's political career appeared to be in eclipse. Several years passed.

In August 2006 Shih came back to prominence. During questioning at the Presidential Office on the afternoon of 7 August 2006, the president detailed to the prosecutor how he spent the fund and presented relevant receipts and bank remittance statements. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118190500/http://english.www.gov.tw/TaiwanHeadlines/index.jsp?categid=8&amp;recordid=99228|title=TaiwanHeadlines - Politics - Chen, Wu questioned in August over fund use|author=|date=18 January 2008|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, [[Shih Ming-te]], a former ally of Chen, wrote a letter to Chen urging him to resign from office and to admit wrongdoing so as to "set a good example for the Taiwanese people". The proposal was rejected. On August 8 Shih announced his intention to open a bank account and collect NT$100 from supporters, which would be used to fund a protest in Taipei aimed at ousting the President.

==Preparations==
On 10 August 2006, Shih Ming-te began to plan the ''"Million Voices against Corruption, President Chen Must Go"'' campaign. Shih offered to lead the [[Taiwanese people]] in street demonstrations if he were able to raise at least 100,000,000 [[New Taiwan Dollar]]s (NTD) in fundraising for his campaign.

In the meantime the [[Pan-Green]] supporters criticized the actions of Shih Ming-Te. Initially they recovered letters from his past begging the government for mercy when he was a political prisoner, but such tactics were widely seen as unseemly. More effective was the fact that Shih, supposedly battling against corruption, had personal connections to former Tuntex Group chairman Chen Yu-hao, one of the island's most famous embezzlers, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/08/19/2003323802|title=KMT confirms Ma, Shih meeting, denies conspiracy - Taipei Times|author=|date=|website=www.taipeitimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a connection that Shih boasts of. Chen Yu-hao is widely known to be strongly opposed to President Chen. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2004/03/19/2003106911|title=Shen fails to clarify his position in scandal - Taipei Times|author=|date=|website=www.taipeitimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greens also raised questions about Shih's own finances, and made allegations that Shih was a tool of the People's Republic of China. Security agencies found no connections, however.

Shih Ming-te called for various prominent Taiwanese (Republic of China) politicians to join in demonstrating for the resignation of Chen Shui-bian. However, although the demonstration was attended by all the major Blue politicians, no prominent Green politicians appeared.

==Demonstrations==

===Early sit-in protests===

[[Image:Million Voices against Corruption, President Chen Must Go Volunteer at Taipei Main Station.jpg|200px|thumb|left|A volunteer of the protest helping to hand out red ribbons to other protesters on 16 September 2006]]
On 9 September 2006, the demonstration began as a gathering in front of the presidential office. Demonstrators were organized into the shape of a compass (as viewed from the sky) to symbolize the protesters' demands for integrity within government. Free meals were offered to the demonstrators by the organizers, and various events were held, including performances by children reciting [[Great Learning|Daxue]], an ancient [[China|Chinese]] text by [[Confucius]] and his followers. Organizers estimated the number of participants to be around 300,000 at the start of the campaign (the police estimated the number to be closer to 90,000).  Demonstrators were dressed in red as a sign of anger, gestured [[thumbs-down]] as a sign of disapproval, and chanted "Ah-Bian, step down!  Ah-Bian, step down!" ({{zh|「阿扁，下台！」}})&lt;ref&gt;"Ah Bian" (阿扁) is a nickname given to Chen Shui Bian by the public.&lt;/ref&gt; as they marched through downtown [[Taipei]].

Various pro-Blue national celebrities and pan-Blue politicians (current and former) took part in the event. Demonstrators consist of Taiwanese (ROC) citizens and foreign nationals of all age groups, including students from various international schools located in Taipei and a number of Japanese-immigrated ROC expatriates.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} However, as numerous sources pointed out, the bulk of Shih's followers were not disappointed moderates from across the political spectrum, as campaign planners claimed, but longtime Blues. Shih himself would later concede this in an interview published in the New York Times on Sept. 28, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/28/world/asia/28taiwan.html|title=Protesters Fuel a Long-Shot Bid to Oust Taiwan’s Leader|first=Keith|last=Bradsher|date=|website=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Surround the City" protest===

[[Image:Peopledeposeabian.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The "surround the city" protest march on 15 September 2006]]
On the night of 15 September 2006, demonstrators organized an effort to "surround the city"  ({{zh|c=圍城|p=Weíchéng}}) with people holding [[glowsticks]] (especially red ones), in order to "block" Chen from leaving the city, as well as to relocate the demonstrations from its original location near the presidential office to [[Taipei Main Station]]. The event proved successful despite the inclement weather. Demonstrators in red shirts held glowsticks as they marched from GongYuan Rd. to the station, filling the entire road.

[[Taipei Rapid Transit System|MRT]] officials announced that additional trains would run until 1 A.M. The next day, the Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation announced a new record of 1.51 million passengers passing in and out of the stations during the night of the protest. Currently, it seems the Main Station has become the most popular public resting place for the protesters past midnight because of its proximity to the protest center as well as conveniences the station provides, including shelter, food, and hygiene facilities. Critics of the demonstrations have pointed out that the protests have increased MRT ridership congestions, as the daily commuters now must cope with the additional riders. In addition, the protests have also caused havoc on Taipei's already congested traffic, and the cost of the protests has become burdensome for the city's residents.

===The "Surround the Island" protest===

After the 15 September 2006 demonstrations, Shih led a team of people through every major city in Taiwan ({{zh|c=環島遍地開花|p=Huándaŏ Piàndì Kaīhuā}}) using tour buses to join local demonstrations. Organizers claim that anti-Chen protests occurred every day in October. The protests were mainly peaceful. Nonetheless, minor incidents of violence erupted when the protesters entered the Pan-Green leaning regions of southern Taiwan.
[[Image:Taiwan's demonstrators1.JPG|thumb|right|The "Besiege the Presidential Office" demonstration on 10 October 2006]]

===The "Besiege the Presidential Office" demonstration===

On 10 October 2006, ROC (Taiwan)'s National Day, the protesters returned to Ketagalan Avenue for another "Besiege the Presidential Office" demonstration ({{zh|c=天下圍攻|p=Tiānxià Weígōng}}) without first seeking demonstration permits from the police. Chen was heckled by opposition legislators of the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] during a state ceremony attended by foreign dignitaries. There were also isolated, minor incidents of violence, including fist fights between Pan-Blue and Pan-Green legislators. In response, President Chen threatened to cancel the National Day celebration for 2007 because "everyone has different opinions and doesn't care"{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Chen also stated his commitment to clean politics and his intolerance of governmental corruption.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061010/ap_on_re_as/taiwan;_ylt=A9FJqZbagixF7xkABgQBxg8F;_ylu=X3oDMTBjMHVqMTQ4BHNlYwN5bnN1YmNhdA--_recNo=3&lt;/ref&gt; After the ceremony, the government criticized the demonstrators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president.gov.tw/php-bin/prez/shownews.php4?_section=3&amp;_recNo=1|title=中華民國總統府|author=|date=|website=www.president.gov.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt; characterizing the demonstrations as disrespectful and illegal. Notably, while attending the ceremony, the AIT ([[American Institute in Taiwan]]) top official (and de facto United States ambassador) asked the protesters "to maintain politeness".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ettoday.com/2006/10/10/10844-2001261.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
Demonstrators claim that the guards protecting and surrounding the office wore red underwear underneath their uniforms, signifying solidarity with the protesters, though they could not display the color on their guard uniforms.

==Aftermath==
Shih, a former political prisoner, has vowed to demonstrate indefinitely outside the presidential office, even until March 2008, when [[Taiwan]] ([[Republic of China]]) is due to hold the next presidential election, or until Chen, [[Chen Shui-Bian|also a former political prisoner]], resigns. However, in December 2006 Shih went back on this pledge, instead retiring to an apartment near the train station and promising to remain there until Chen's term was over.

On 14 October 2006, the Taipei Police repealed Shih's petition for further protest on Ketagalan Avenue because the protests on 10 October 2006 had violated the city law. Afterward, Shih agreed to shrink the size of their demonstration before planning another massive campaign.

The anti-Chen campaign achieved its intended effect of ousting the DPP from power, and returning the former Kuomintang to power. The efforts of the Pan-Blue red shirts have been widely praised by Chinese government media and various media outlets controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/taiwan/2008/taiwan-080322-cna02.htm|title=Decisive election win puts KMT back in power|first=John|last=Pike|date=|website=www.globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 November 2006, Chen's wife [[Wu Shu-chen]] (吳淑珍) and three other high-ranking officials of the Presidential Office were indicted of forgery and embezzlement of [[New Taiwan dollar|NTD]] 14.8 million (US$450,000) of government funds using faked documents. Due to the protection from the Constitution against prosecution of the sitting president, Chen could not be prosecuted until he left office, and he was not indicted, but was alleged to be an accomplice on his wife's indictment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6112668.stm|title=Taiwan's Chen in corruption case|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2006-11-03|accessdate=2006-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecutor of the case has indicated that once Chen leaves office, his office will start the procedures to press charges against Chen. His wife Wu becomes the first sitting [[First Lady]] of the [[Republic of China]] to face criminal charges since the foundation of the Republic in 1911.

The indictment filed by prosecutors states that the indicted persons obtained government funds earmarked for secret foreign affairs, yet of six supposed secret diplomatic missions, there was sufficient evidence presented for only two. Of the remaining four, it was concluded that one did not exist, and in the case of the other three, the invoices presented were not found to be related to the secret missions.

The [[Pan-Blue coalition]], after receiving the news, demanded to call for another recall motion unless Chen resigned immediately. Another small party that backed Chen previously, Taiwan Solidarity Union, founded by former KMT Chairman and ROC President [[Lee Teng-hui]], said Friday they would likely to support the upcoming recall measure. However, the TSU said it would only support the new recall motion if "concrete evidence concerning corruption is presented." If the recall passed, it would be up to the voters to decide Chen's fate in an island-wide referendum.

Leaders of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] met together on Friday to discuss the unfavorable charges. The meeting ended when party leaders demanded Chen to explain the accusation within three days. There has long been rumbles inside the DPP that Chen has become their liability and that they should recall him before the presidential election. If Chen resigned, he would be the first Taiwanese president to step down and the outspoken vice president [[Annette Lu]] would likely take power.

After the prosecutor announced the indictment news, the campaign leader Shih proclaimed in a rally in Friday that the indictment was the historical high point in [[Taiwan]] and the month long campaign was a success. Then, Shih led the protesters back to Ketagalan  Boulevard for more sit-in demonstrations.

In a press conference 5 November 2006, Chen rebutted the charges against his wife and members of his Presidential office. He said that Taiwan government offices advised him to prepare the receipts in such a fashion, and that after 6 years of doing so, it is strange that they would never mention an irregularity if it wasn't the right way to do it. He promised that all of the money actually went to diplomatic missions and did not go into any private pockets. Furthermore, he mentioned that when he took office, he thought his salary was so excessive that he cut his own salary in half, and that reduction is more than the amount he is accused of embezzling, so there is no need for him to take those money. In addition, he said that if the charges against his wife were proven in a court of law just as they were charged, then he would at that time step down as President of the Republic of China.

The First Lady claimed to have fainted during a press conference, and is currently staying in the NTU Hospital. However, many dispute that Wu truly lost consciousness, as she grabbed a bodyguard after she collapsed.

===Anniversary===
On 9 September 2007, thousand of protesters gathered at Ketagalan Boulevard to mark the one-year anniversary of the campaign. More than 1000 police officers were deployed, but no clashes were reported in the candle-lit vigil. Campaign leader Shih Ming-teh also appeared at the vigil to address the crowd. He reassured that their persistence would pay off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ir_uPHYEK85enfF56_GLU37uNoUw  Thousands protest against Taiwan's graft-tainted president] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207175832/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ir_uPHYEK85enfF56_GLU37uNoUw |date=2012-02-07 }}, AFP&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monklandsgate''' was the name of a [[Political scandals in the United Kingdom|political scandal]] in the former Scottish local government [[Districts of Scotland|district]] of [[Monklands, Scotland|Monklands]] (now part of [[North Lanarkshire]]) which dominated the [[Monklands East by-election, 1994|Monklands East by-election]] in 1994.

Monklandsgate consisted of allegations of [[sectarianism]] spending discrepancies between [[Protestant]] [[Airdrie, North Lanarkshire|Airdrie]] and [[Roman Catholicism in Scotland|Catholic]] [[Coatbridge]], fuelled by the fact that all 17 of the ruling [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] group were Roman Catholics.

Accusations included: £21m spent on capital projects in [[Coatbridge]] while only £2m was spent in Airdrie; councillors handing out green job application forms while the job centre handed out white ones; and also accusations of [[nepotism]] as dozens of council workers were related to Labour councillors. The accusations were of increased interest to the media as the [[Monklands West (UK Parliament constituency)|Monklands West]] MP was [[Tom Clarke (politician)|Tom Clarke]], former Monklands District [[Provost (civil)|Provost]] and one time Shadow [[Secretary of State for Scotland]], while the [[Monklands East (UK Parliament constituency)|Monklands East]] MP was the Labour leader, [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]]. The allegations of [[sectarianism]] were found to be untrue, however allegations of [[nepotism]] proved to be true.

Despite the allegations [[Helen Liddell]] narrowly retained the seat for Labour, against a strong swing to [[Kay Ullrich]] of the [[Scottish National Party]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/345780.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Women's Party of Turkey''' ({{lang-tr|Türkiye Ulusal Kadınlar Partisi}}, TUKP for short) was a former [[Turkey|Turkish]] political party.

It was founded on 17 November 1972 by [[Mübeccel Göktuna|Mübeccel Göktuna Törüner]] in [[İstanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://yyusozluk.com/sozluk.php?process=word&amp;q=t%FCrkiye%20ulusal%20kad%FDnlar%20partisi]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s [[Women in Turkish politics|women's participation in Turkish politics]] was very low. For example, in the 1969 elections only 5 women MPs were elected to the 450-seat lower house of the  parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/haber.aspx?id=109330 Hürriyet newspaper {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the goal of the party was to increase women's participation in politics.

However the party faced with legal barriers. In order to enter the elections, the party had to form branch offices in at least 15 provinces which the party failed to achieve. Before they were able to fulfill the legal requirements to enter the election however, the activities of all Turkish parties were suspended as a result of the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état]]. On 16 September 1981 the party (like all other parties) was closed by the military rule. Unlike main parties, the National Women's party was not revived after Turkey returned to civilian democracy in 1983. In June 2014, however, women's rights activists (led by Benal Yazgan) submitted a petition to the Interior Ministry for a new Woman Party (''Kadın Partisi'') to be formally registered as a political party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkeys-first-womens-party-to-be-established-.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=68369&amp;NewsCatID=338 Turkey’s first ‘women’s party’ to be established]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Japanese name| Shiōden }}
{{nihongo|'''Nobutaka Shiōden'''|四王天 延孝|Shiōden Nobutaka| 2 September 1878 – 8 August 1962}} was a  [[lieutenant general]] in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], [[legislator]] in the [[Diet of Japan]], and [[propagandist]] of a [[Jewish]] [[conspiracy theory]] during and after [[World War II]].

==Biography==
A native of [[Saitama Prefecture]], Shiōden was a graduate of the 11th class of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] in November 1899, and was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Imperial Guard of Japan]]. He served in various postings with the Imperial Guard, including some time with the Japanese garrison force in China, and also served in a number of administrative and staff positions within the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]]. He graduated from the [[Army War College (Japan)|Army Staff College]] in 1909.

During [[World War I]], from 1914-1918 Shiōden was sent to [[France]] as a [[military attaché]] and official Japanese military observer. While in [[Paris]], he was exposed to the common theory that an international [[Jewish conspiracy]] was behind the war, thereafter he began to research into issues related to [[Freemasonry]], and the so-called “Jewish-problem”, as a result of which he became a fervent [[anti-Semite]] and leading voice of anti-Semitic propaganda in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, ''Jews in the Japanese Mind''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, Shiōden was assigned to the [[Harbin]] special operations office within the [[Kwantung Army]]. Harbin was home to a large population of [[Russian people|Russians]], including many [[Jew]]s. A strong supporter of [[military aviation]] from his first-hand experiences in World War I, Shiōden returned to Japan in 1922 to assume command of the Army Aviation School. He later served on the Military Aviation Bureau within the General Staff.

In 1924, Shiōden was promoted to [[major general]].

In 1936, Shiōden translated "[[The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]]" into [[Japanese language|Japanese]].&lt;ref&gt;Renolds, ''Japan in the Fascist Era''&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1928, he served on the staff of the [[IJA 16th Division]] and [[IJA 3rd Division]]. He was promoted to [[lieutenant general]] in 1929, and entered the reserves the same year. He subsequently served in the largely honorary post as Chairman of the Imperial Aviation Association, which promoted the development of Japanese military aviation and ran donation campaigns for the funding of new aircraft. From 1942-1945, he served as a member of the [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]] in the [[Diet of Japan]].

After the [[surrender of Japan]], Shiōden was arrested by the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|American occupation authorities]], but was not prosecuted for any [[war crimes]] and was released in 1947.

The '''Oregon Citizens Alliance''' ('''OCA''') was a  [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Christianity|Christian]] political activist organization, founded by Lon Mabon in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]]. It was founded in 1986 as a vehicle to challenge then–[[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Bob Packwood]] in the Republican primaries,&lt;ref name="wweekanniv"&gt;{{cite news

   }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and was involved in Oregon politics from the late 1980s into the 1990s.

==Legislative activism==
In 1988 the group sponsored [[Oregon Ballot Measure 8 (1988)|Measure 8]], an initiative that repealed [[Governor of Oregon|Governor]] [[Neil Goldschmidt]]'s executive order banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in the executive branch of state government. The measure not only repealed the executive order, but also put a statute on the books that prohibited any job protection for gay people in state government. The measure was approved by the voters, 52.7 percent to 47.3 percent.  It was the OCA's only statewide victory.

Afterwards, the OCA turned its attention to abortion. It placed [[Oregon Ballot Measure 10 (1990)|Measure 10]] on the 1990 general election ballot, which would have required parental notification for a minor's abortion. The measure was defeated, 52.2 percent to 47.8 percent.

In 1992 the OCA returned to the issue of homosexuality, when it proposed [[Oregon Ballot Measure 9 (1992)|Measure 9]]. This [[initiative]] would have amended the [[Oregon Constitution]] to prevent what the OCA called "special rights" for [[homosexual]]s and [[bisexual]]s, by adding a provision that the state "recognizes homosexuality, pedophilia, sadism and masochism as abnormal, wrong, unnatural, and perverse." The ballot measure was defeated, 56 percent to 44 percent. That same year, the [[Oregon Court of Appeals]] declared Measure 8 unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;''Merrick v. Board of Higher Education'', 116 Or App 258, 841 P2d 646 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result, the OCA's only statewide victory was nullified.

The OCA promoted similar measures at the local level, both before and after the 1992 election, but those measures were ultimately invalidated by the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]]. It also promoted similar statewide measures with language softer than that of Measure 9.&lt;!--

The organized opposition to 1992's Measure 9 formed the basis of much of the current [[LGBT rights]] movement in Oregon, including the organization [[Basic Rights Oregon]].&lt;ref name="wweekanniv"/&gt;

After failing to pass [[Oregon Ballot Measure 9 (1992)|Measure 9]] in 1992, the OCA turned its attention to passing anti-discrimination bans at the county and municipal level. Couching the debate in terms of forbidding LGBT people from receiving so-called "special rights," the OCA sought not only to block ordinances in these communities but to bar them from spending money to "promote homosexuality."&lt;ref name="junction"&gt;{{cite news

The OCA was successful in passing over two dozen initiatives. However, in 1993 the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] passed a law prohibiting local governments from considering LGBT rights measures so the ordinances had no legal force.&lt;ref name="org1111"&gt;{{cite news

==Hands Off Washington==
In 1993, the OCA intervened in Washington state politics by introducing two ballot measures that would have threatened the employability of persons who were LGBT, or were perceived to be. An ''ad hoc'' grassroots movement called [[Citizens for Fairness Hands Off Washington|Hands Off Washington]] was organized in opposition to the measures. The Hands Off Washington campaign repelled both efforts.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

== 1996 Senate race ==
In [[United States Senate special election in Oregon, 1996|the 1996 U.S. Senate special election]] to succeed Senator Packwood, the OCA endorsed [[Gordon Smith (politician)|Gordon Smith]] over [[Ron Wyden]] in the race. Critics faulted Smith for failing to take a strong stand against the OCA, and he was defeated by Wyden. When Smith made a [[United States Senate election in Oregon, 1996|second run for the Senate]] a few months later after incumbent [[Mark Hatfield]] had retired, Mabon ran against Smith. ''[[The Oregonian]]'' cited Mabon's candidacy as a key component of Smith's attempt in the second race to establish himself as a [[centrism|centrist]], contributing to his victory over [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Tom Bruggere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{United States Senate}}

The '''Senate Majority and Minority Leaders''' are two [[United States Senate|United States Senators]] and members of the [[party leadership of the United States Senate]]. These leaders serve as the chief Senate spokespeople for the [[Political party|political parties]] respectively holding the majority and the minority in the [[United States Senate]], and manage and schedule the legislative and executive business of the Senate. They are elected to their positions in the Senate by their respective party [[Party caucuses and conferences in the United States Congress|caucuses]], the [[Democratic Caucus of the United States Senate|Senate Democratic Caucus]] and the [[Republican Conference of the United States Senate|Senate Republican Conference]].

By rule, the [[Presiding Officer of the United States Senate|Presiding Officer]] gives the Majority Leader priority in obtaining recognition to speak on the floor of the Senate. The Majority Leader customarily serves as the chief representative of their party in the Senate, and sometimes even in all of [[United States Congress|Congress]] if the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and thus the office of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] is controlled by the opposition party.

The Assistant Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate (commonly called Senate Majority and Minority [[Whip (politics)|Whips]]) are the second-ranking members of each party's leadership. The main function of the Majority and Minority Whips is to gather votes on major issues. Because they are the second ranking members of the Senate, if there is no [[floor leader]] present, the whip may become acting floor leader. Before 1969, the official titles were Majority Whip and Minority Whip.

==Current floor leaders==
The Senate is [[Current members of the United States Senate|currently composed]] of 51 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], 47 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], and 2 [[independent politician|independents]], both of whom [[Democratic Caucus of the United States Senate|caucus with the Democrats]].

The current leaders are long-time Senators [[Mitch McConnell]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]) from [[List of United States Senators from Kentucky|Kentucky]] and [[Chuck Schumer]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]) from [[List of United States Senators from New York|New York]]. The current Assistant Leaders/Whips are long-time Senators [[John Cornyn]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]) from [[List of United States Senators from Texas|Texas]] and [[Dick Durbin]] ([[United States Democratic Party|D]]) from [[List of United States Senators from Illinois|Illinois]].

==History==
Democrats began the practice of electing floor leaders in 1920 while they were in the minority. [[John W. Kern]] was a Democratic Senator from Indiana. While the title was not official, he is considered{{by whom|date=July 2017}} to be the first Senate party leader from 1913 through 1917 (and in turn, the first Senate Democratic Leader), while serving concurrently as Chairman of the Senate Democratic Caucus. In 1925 the majority (at the time) Republicans also adopted this language when [[Charles Curtis]] became the first (official) Majority Leader{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}, although his immediate predecessor [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] is considered the first (unofficial) Senate Majority Leader.

The Constitution designates the [[Vice President of the United States]] as [[Vice President of the United States#Roles of the vice president|President of the United States Senate]]. The Constitution also calls for a [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore]] to serve as the leader of the body when the President of the Senate (the Vice President) is absent. In practice, neither the Vice President nor the President ''pro tempore''—customarily the most senior (longest-serving) Senator in the majority party—actually presides over the Senate on a daily basis; that task is given to junior Senators of the majority party.  Since the Vice President may be of a different party than the majority and is not a member subject to discipline, the rules of procedure of the Senate give the presiding officer very little power and none beyond the presiding role.  For these reasons, it is the Majority Leader who, in practice, manages the Senate.  This is in contrast to the House of Representatives where the elected Speaker of the House has a great deal of discretionary power and generally presides over votes on bills.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==List of party leaders==
The Democratic Party first selected a leader in 1920. The Republican Party first formally designated a leader in 1925.

Accordingly, the minutes of the [[Republican Conference of the United States Senate|Republican Conference]] for the period state: "On motion of Senator Hastings, duly seconded and carried, it was agreed that no Assistant Leader or Whip be elected but that the chairman be authorized to appoint Senators from time to time to assist him in taking charge of the interests of the minority." A note attached to the conference minutes added: "The chairman of the conference, Senator McNary, apparently appointed Senator Austin of Vermont as assistant leader in 1943 and 1944, until the conference adopted Rules of Organization."

Hawken was active in the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref name="Sea Change"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paul Hawken Part II: Cultivating Progress|url=http://www.cchange.net/2014/11/11/progress/|accessdate=15 June 2016|publisher=Sea Change|date=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently lives in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

==Writing==
Hawken has authored articles, op-eds, and peer-reviewed papers, and has written seven books, including: ''The Next Economy'' (Ballantine 1983), ''Growing a Business'' (Simon and Schuster 1987), ''The Ecology of Commerce'' (HarperCollins 1993), and ''Blessed Unrest'' (Viking 2007).&lt;ref name="Sustainable Brands Bio"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paul Hawken|url=http://www.sustainablebrands.com/users/paul_hawken#|accessdate=15 June 2016|publisher=Sustainable Brands|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Ecology of Commerce'' was voted the #1 college text on business and the environment by professors in 67 business schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Solutions Summit Event|url=http://northstar.environment.umn.edu/events/solutions-summit/paul-hawken/|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The businessman and environmentalist [[Ray Anderson (entrepreneur)|Ray Anderson]] of [[Interface, Inc.]] credited ''The Ecology of Commerce'' with his environmental awakening. He described reading it as a “spear in the chest experience,” after which Anderson started crisscrossing the country with a near-evangelical fervor, telling fellow executives about the need to reduce waste and carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vitello|first=Paul|title=Ray Anderson, Businessman Turned Environmentalist, Dies at 77|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/business/ray-anderson-a-carpet-innovator-dies-at-77.html?_r=1|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]'' (Little Brown, September 1999), co-authored with [[Amory Lovins]], popularized the now standard idea of [[natural capital]] and direct accounting for [[ecosystem services]].  It has been read and referred to by several heads of state including [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] who called it one of the five most important books in the world today, stating "Natural Capitalism basically proves beyond any argument that there are presently available technologies, and those just on the horizon, which will permit us to get richer by cleaning, not by spoiling, the environment.&lt;ref name="Natural Capitalism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawken|first1=Paul|title=Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution|date=1997|publisher=Little Brown|isbn=978-0-316-35300-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;" ''Natural Capitalism'' has been translated into 14 other languages. Together with ''The Ecology of Commerce'' these books have been described as being "among the first to point the way towards a sustainable global economy".&lt;ref name="Marc Gunther 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gunther|first1=Marc|title=First look: environmental entrepreneur Paul Hawken's long-awaited new book|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/22/first-look-environmental-entrepreneur-paul-hawkens-long-awaited-new-book|accessdate=15 June 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Blessed Unrest|Blessed Unrest, How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming]]'', published in May 2007, argues that a vast “movement with no name” is forming involving environmental, social justice, and indigenous rights organizations. He conceives of this "movement" as developing not by [[ideology]] but rather through the identification of what is and is not humane, and has compared it to humanity's collective [[immune system]].&lt;ref name="Blessed Unrest"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawken|first1=Paul|title=Blessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming|date=2007|publisher=Viking|location=New York|isbn=978-0-670-03852-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Growing a Business'' became the basis of a 17-part [[PBS]] series, which Hawken hosted and produced. The program, which explored the challenges and pitfalls of starting and operating socially responsible companies, appeared on television in 115 countries and reached more than 100 million people.&lt;ref name="Why Paul Hawken is teaching MBAs" /&gt;

==Business==
Hawken founded several companies, starting when he took over a small retail store in Boston in 1967 called Erewhon (after [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s  1872 [[Erewhon|utopian novel]]) and turned it into the Erewhon Trading Company, a natural-foods wholesaler, and one of the first in the US that relied solely on sustainable agricultural methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heritage of Health Foods: Erewhon History|url=http://www.attunefoods.com/company-history-of-gluten-free-cereal-with-high-fiber|accessdate=15 June 2016|publisher=Attune Foods}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he left the company in the 1970s, it had over 30,000 acres of organically grown food under contract. He co-founded the [[Smith &amp; Hawken]] garden supply company in 1979, a retail and catalog business.&lt;ref name="Smith &amp; Hawken Mercury News"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Welte|first1=Jim|title=Smith &amp; Hawken to close; going-out-of-business sales started Thursday|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/topstories/ci_12798190|accessdate=15 June 2016|publisher=The Mercury News|date=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Hawken founded OneSun, an energy company focused on ultra low-cost solar based on green chemistry and biomimicry.&lt;ref name="GreenBiz Winning Investment Strategy"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gunther|first1=Marc|title=Paul Hawken's Winning Investment Strategy|url=http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2010/02/11/paul-hawkens-winning-investment-strategy|accessdate=15 June 2016|publisher=GreenBiz|date=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1994 up until 1998 Hawken founded and headed up The Natural Step USA. From 1996 to 1998, Hawken was Co-chairman of The Natural Step International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bio Paul Hawken|url=http://www.natcap.org/images/other/NCbios.pdf|publisher=The Rocky Mountain Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Natural Step was founded in 1989 by Swedish scientist and medical doctor, [[Karl-Henrik Robèrt]] in order to create shared frameworks for understanding sustainable development. Its purpose is to teach and support environmental systems thinking in corporations, cities, governments, unions, and academic institutions through a dialogue process rooted in basic science.&lt;ref name="The Natural Step"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Natural Step About Us|url=http://www.thenaturalstep.org/about-us/|website=The Natural Step|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Hawken created the Natural Capital Institute (NCI) located in [[Sausalito, California]]. Its main focus was [[wiser.org]], an open-source database of activists and civil society organizations focused on environmental and social justice.&lt;ref name="Treehugger wiser.org"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grover|first1=Sami|title=WISER Earth: User Created Directory of 'the Largest Movement on Earth'|url=http://www.treehugger.com/culture/wiser-earth-user-created-directory-of-the-largest-movement-on-earth.html|accessdate=15 June 2016|publisher=Treehugger|date=21 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawken is currently the Executive Director of Project Drawdown which is working towards the [[Drawdown (climate)|drawdown]] of greenhouse gases to reduce [[Climate change|climate change]].&lt;ref name="Drawdown 'Our Team'"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Team|url=http://www.drawdown.org/our-team/|website=Project Drawdown|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
In 1965, Hawken worked with [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s staff in Selma, Alabama prior to the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|historic March on Montgomery]]. As press coordinator, he registered members of the press, issued credentials, gave dozens of updates and interviews on national radio, and acted as marshal for the final march. That same year, he worked in New Orleans as a staff photographer for the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], focusing on voter registration drives in [[Bogalusa, Louisiana]] and the panhandle of Florida, and photographing the Klan in Meridian Mississippi after three civil rights workers were tortured and killed. In Meridian, he was assaulted and seized by Ku Klux Klan members, but escaped due to FBI surveillance and intervention.&lt;ref name="James C. Stephens"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stephens|first1=James C.|title=Climate Change: An Encyclopedia of Science and History|pages=849|edition=Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15971">'''Personal Independence Payment''' (abbreviated to '''PIP''' and usually pronounced as one word) is a [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare benefit in the United Kingdom]] that is intended to help with the extra costs of living with a long-term health condition or a disability. 

It is non-[[means-tested]], [[National insurance contributions|non-contributory]] and tax-free; it is not linked to a person's ability to work and it is available equally to people in or out of work. It is not intended to be a substitute for a person's earnings, unlike [[Employment and Support Allowance]] (ESA) or ESA's predecessor, [[Incapacity Benefit]].

Eligibility for PIP is based upon the practical effects of a condition on a person's life, rather than the condition itself. It is not currently available to children; it can be claimed by adults under the State Pension age, and people already on the benefit will continue to receive it after they retire. PIP and the benefit it replaces are predominantly received by older people, because increasing age is the main risk factor for developing disabling diseases.

PIP was introduced by the [[Welfare Reform Act 2012]] and began to replace [[Disability Living Allowance]] (DLA) for new claims from 8 April 2013, by means of an initial pilot in selected areas of north-west and north-east England. A full roll-out across Great Britain was planned for October 2013.&lt;ref name=disabilityrights-pip&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Independence Payment (PIP)|url=http://www.disabilityrightsuk.org/personal-independence-payment-pip|work=Factsheet F60|publisher=Disability Rights UK|accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dwp-pip&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Independence Payment|url=http://www.dwp.gov.uk/policy/disability/personal-independence-payment/|publisher=Department for Work and Pensions|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this roll-out was delayed – primarily because the main contractor, Atos, wanted to ensure that the process was as reliable as possible; also, the assessments took much longer than expected, and assessors were hard to recruit - and as a result ministers announced that the roll-out would happen more gradually than originally planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disability Welfare Changes Delayed by assessment process|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24680366|accessdate=26 October 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although PIP was expected to cut costs by 20% over the longer term, costs were forecast to rise by £1billion to £15.4billion in 2015-16, partly due to a rise in mental health issues and learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/georgeosborne/12191676/George-Osborne-clears-path-for-tax-cuts-in-Budget-with-1bn-benefits-raid.html |title=George Osborne clears path for tax cuts in Budget with £1bn benefits raid}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35864438 |title=Pensions stance creates budgetary mayhem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New rules were introduced in 2017 and many charities say disabled people will be left without support.  The Disability Benefits Consortium (DBC) (comprising charities including [[Parkinson's UK]], the [[Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain|MS Society]] and [[Mind (charity)|Mind]]) claimed about 160,000 people receiving PIP would be affected by proposed changes.  Phil Reynolds of the consortium said, "Across the DBC we have had our helpline and advice services inundated by calls about PIP since it was introduced.  Instead of supporting disabled people, the benefits system seems increasingly rigged against them.  The whole system needs urgent improvement, in order to accurately assess the support they need. Disabled people cannot afford to wait."  Charities that represent mental health and learning disability groups claim the changes do not recognise that the costs connected with those conditions are as severe as for other impairments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39275787 Charities' plea over Personal Independence Payments] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claiming PIP ==
Claims will usually but not always be started over the phone. Most people claiming PIP are required to undergo assessments to prove their eligibility for the benefit.  Payments are varied according to the severity of disability as decided by the tests and relate to ability to carry out daily living activities and level mobility. Claimants are also required to undergo periodic re-assessments to ensure ongoing eligibility for the benefit; depending on the type of disability, a person may be given a short award of up to two years or longer PIP award which would last for up to five or ten years.&lt;ref name=disabilityrights-pip /&gt;

PIP is not available to children under sixteen and PIP claimants must apply before they turn sixty five years old as new PIP claims cannot be made after that age. DLA continues for children, and for existing recipients aged sixty four or over on 8 April 2013; other people currently receiving DLA will be asked to claim PIP instead at some point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Independence Payment|url=https://www.gov.uk/pip|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responsibility for the tests has been [[outsourcing|outsourced]] by the DWP to two private companies, Independent Assessment Services (formerly known as [[Atos Healthcare]]) in the north of England, London, southern England and Scotland, and [[Capita Group|Capita Business Services Ltd]] in central England, Wales and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name=disabilityrights-pip /&gt;

The PIP Assessment Guide (Updated on 1 May 2016) states: 'It would not be practical for the assessment to take account of the impact of a health condition or impairment on all everyday activities, nor to seek to include all possible areas where extra costs may be generated.'

===Eligibility===
To qualify for PIP you must be between 16 and 64 and living in Great Britain and also:
* have had difficulties with daily living or getting around (or both) for at least 3 months
* expect these difficulties to continue for at least 9 months (unless you’re terminally ill with less than 6 months to live)&lt;ref name=eligibilitygov&gt;https://www.gov.uk/pip/eligibility&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction and analysis==
In April 2013 [[Iain Duncan Smith]], the sponsor of the Welfare Reform Act, expressed his support for the changes to disability benefits brought about by the new law. He was critical of the older system of disability benefits which awarded an allowance to claimants with no further systematic checks to assess if the claimant's condition had improved or worsened. Iain Duncan Smith stated that, by requiring claimants to undergo periodic assessments, the system could be targeted at those most in need whilst preventing payments being made to people who had recovered from a temporary disability.&lt;ref name=ids-ridiculous&gt;{{cite news|title=Last-minute rush to avoid tough new test for disability benefit as Iain Duncan Smith praises reform of 'ridiculous' system|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2305556/Last-minute-rush-avoid-tough-new-test-disability-benefit.html|accessdate=8 April 2013|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK [[disability rights movement|disability rights]] organisation [[Scope (charity)|Scope]] has been critical of PIP and, while it expressed support in principle for assessing claimants more carefully, took the view that the assessment criteria were flawed, would cause undue hardship to disabled people and were too strongly focused on cutting welfare budgets.&lt;ref name=bbc-pip&gt;{{cite news|title=Disability Living Allowance replaced by PIP scheme|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22058059|accessdate=8 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the introduction of PIP, work capability assessments carried out by the private contractor Atos were subjected to critical scrutiny in Parliament following a number of controversial decisions in which disabled individuals were denied benefits and required to look for work, work they could not do due to their disability.&lt;ref name=guardian-atos&gt;{{cite news|title=Atos comes under attack in emotional Commons debate|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jan/17/atos-attack-emotional-commons-debate|accessdate=8 April 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014 the [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] expressed the view that the implementation of the PIP scheme had been ''"nothing short of a fiasco"'', a charge rejected by the Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Disabled benefit delays a 'fiasco', say MPs|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27926419|date=20 June 2014|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain]] produced a report about its members experiences of the test in September 2015.  1,780 participated. 42% of those who had a face-to-face assessment said the hidden symptoms of the condition had not been taken into account. More than a third said face-to-face assessments had caused their condition to relapse or deteriorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MS: Enough|url=http://www.mssociety.org.uk/msenough|accessdate=14 September 2015|publisher=MS Society|date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Daily living component==

There are two components of PIP: daily living and mobility needs. Each component can be paid at standard or enhanced rates.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/pip/what-youll-get&lt;/ref&gt;

* preparing or eating food
* washing, bathing and using the toilet
* dressing and undressing
* reading and communicating

The [https://www.motability.co.uk/about-the-scheme/personal-independence-payment/ Enhanced rate of the mobility component of PIP] can be exchanged for a vehicle or scooter on the [https://www.motability.co.uk Motability Scheme].

Over 50,000 claimants lost their cars because they can walk 20 metres even if they cannot walk 50 metres.  Many claimants had the full benefit reinstated on appeal but they lost their cars while they were waiting to appeal and possibly lost their job as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39575293 Thousands have disability vehicles taken away] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award duration==

PIP is usually awarded for a fixed period, after which the claimant will have to re-apply if necessary. The exception is for the minority of claimants for whom PIP is awarded ongoing as their situation is not expected to improve or get worse.

* Shorter term awards: Up to two years.
* Longer term awards: Up to ten years.

All awards, including ongoing awards, are subject to review at any time.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/180954/pip-briefing-award-durations.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Campaigners have expressed concern for patients with progressive, incurable conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease are made to attend reassessments though it is unlikely they will get better and they will probably only get worse.  [[Carol Monaghan]] said she would challenge four cases of patients with multiple sclerosis being called for reassessment despite their illness worsening. “MS is a progressive condition. They’re never going to be any better than they are at the moment, so they should never be asked to go for a reassessment.  Some of these people are still able to walk to a certain extent, so they get themselves in, just about, and then they’re being told, ‘You look fine,’” she said.  Phil Reynolds of Parkinson's UK said about a quarter of British people with Parkinson’s lost some or all their benefit after reassessments, but got payments reinstated after appeal. “It’s absolutely crucial that the DWP looks again at the broken PIP assessment to ensure people with long-term conditions get the support they so desperately need, rather than rigging the system against them,” he said.  Almost half multiple sclerosis patients claiming PIP must be reassessed inside two years, the [[Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain|MS Society]] claims. “We’re concerned about the number of people with MS being inappropriately reassessed, especially when we know assessments can cause stress and anxiety, and in some cases exacerbate MS symptoms.  With more than 100,000 people living with MS in the UK, the PIP system needs to accurately reflect the realities of living with a fluctuating and progressive condition. Having a disability like MS is hard enough. People should be able to rely on support without fear of having it taken away,” said Laura Wetherly of the MS Society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/10/stop-pip-reassessments-for-patients-with-progressive-diseases-campaigners-say  Stop PIP reassessments for patients with progressive diseases, campaigners say] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pietro Valpreda''' (22 June 1933 – 6 July 2002) was an [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchist]], poet, dancer and novelist. 

He was sentenced to prison on charges of being responsible of the December 1969 [[Piazza Fontana bombing]]; in 1987 was acquitted by the [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Italy)|Supreme Court of Cassation]] for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name="free"&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1987/01/28/strage-di-piazza-fontana-azzerati-17-anni.html?ref=search "STRAGE DI PIAZZA FONTANA AZZERATI 17 ANNI DI INDAGINI"], ''[[la Repubblica]]'', January 28, 1987 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Valpreda came from a poor working-class family in [[Milan]], and, after the end of his formal education, attended dance school. He made his living as a minor dancer on stage. He moved to [[Rome]] in 1969 where he frequented the "[[Bakunin]] Circle", before founding with several friends the "{{ill|22 March Circle|it|Circolo anarchico 22 marzo}}".

Following the December 12, 1969 [[Piazza Fontana bombing]], carried out in the middle of the ''[[autunno caldo]]'' of 1969 (Hot Autumn), he was arrested by the police. A taximan testified having seen him on the Piazza a short time before the bombing,&lt;ref name="tassista"&gt;[[Giorgio Bocca]], [http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2009/12/11/quella-sera-in-piazza-fontana.html "Quella sera in piazza Fontana"], ''[[la Repubblica]]'', December 11, 2009 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which left 17 dead and 88 injured. His testimony was not considered reliable, even if made in good faith.&lt;ref&gt;[[Indro Montanelli]] and [[Mario Cervi]], ''L'Italia degli anni di piombo 1965-1978'', Rizzoli, 1991 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another anarchist, [[Giuseppe Pinelli]], was also arrested for the bombing, and died a few days later while he was illegally detained by the police.&lt;ref name="Pinelli"&gt;Guido Crainz, [http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2009/12/11/piazza-fontana.html "PIAZZA FONTANA"], ''[[la Repubblica]]'', December 11, 2009 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Pietro Valpreda's name was splashed across the media as "the monster of Piazza Fontana"&lt;ref name="film"&gt;Paolo D'Agostini, [http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2009/12/12/piazza-fontana-il-film.html "Piazza Fontana il film"], ''[[la Repubblica]]'', December 12, 2009 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the television reporter [[Bruno Vespa]] claimed that "the guilty man has been found".&lt;ref name="Pinelli" /&gt; For three years, he languished in jail, awaiting trial. All over Italy, there were huge pro-Valpreda demonstrations and the trial was moved to the deep south, to avoid "political interference". Valpreda published his prison diaries, entitled ''It Is Him'' – the words used by the alleged witness, taxi driver Cornelio Rolandi.

The criminal trial started at [[Rome]] on February 23, 1972:&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Zavoli, ''La notte della Repubblica'', Nuova Eri, 1992 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Italian [[Judiciary]] took 15 years to conclude that Valpreda was acquitted for lack of evidence&lt;ref name="free"/&gt; and 29 years to find someone else guilty of the bombing.&lt;ref&gt;"Tre ergastoli per la strage di piazza Fontana", ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', July 1, 2001 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Maria Maggi, Giancarlo Rognoni and [[Delfo Zorzi]], sentenced to life imprisonment, were acquitted by the Appeal Court in 2004, and by the Supreme Court of Cassation in 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later found out that neofascists were [[Ordine Nuovo]]'s members.

As it emerged later, most probably Valpreda was mistaken for {{ill|Antonio Sottosanti|it}}, an extremist, close to the neofascist scene, and who was a lookalike of the anarchist.&lt;ref&gt;"Sul taxi della strage il sosia di Valpreda", ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', June 19, 2000 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his release, Valpreda continued to work as a dancer and opened a bar in Milano. He wrote four books with {{ill|Piero Colaprico|it}}.&lt;ref name="Colaprico"&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2008/10/13/colaprico-racconta-come-nasce-un-noir.html "Colaprico racconta come nasce un noir"], ''[[la Repubblica]]'', October 13, 2008 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Prince v. Massachusetts''''', 321 U.S. 158 (1944), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that the government has broad authority to regulate the actions and treatment of children. Parental authority is not absolute and can be permissibly restricted if doing so is in the interests of a child's welfare. While children share many of the rights of adults, they face different potential harms from similar activities.

== Background ==
A [[Jehovah's Witness]] woman named Sarah Prince was convicted for violating child labor laws. She was the guardian of a nine-year-old girl, Betty M. Simmons, whom she had brought into a downtown area to preach on the streets. The preaching involved distributing literature in exchange for voluntary contributions. The child labor laws that she was charged with violating stipulated that no boys under 12 and no girls under 18 were permitted to sell literature or other goods on public thoroughfares.

There were three complaints filed against Prince:

#Refusal to disclose her child's identity and age to a public officer whose duty was to enforce the statutes;
#Furnishing the girl with magazines, knowing she was to sell them unlawfully, that is, on the street; and
#As child's custodian, permitting her to work contrary to law.

Both Prince and her husband were ordained ministers and commonly took their children out to distribute religious literature. Prince argued that the state's child labor laws violated her Fourteenth Amendment rights to exercise her religion and her equal protection rights, in particular because the children themselves were ministers of their religion as well.

== Decision ==
In a 5–4 decision, with Justice [[Wiley Blount Rutledge|Rutledge]] writing the majority opinion, the Supreme Court upheld the Massachusetts laws restricting the abilities of children to sell religious literature. The decision asserted that the government has broad authority to regulate the actions and treatment of children. Parental authority is not absolute and can be permissibly restricted if doing so is in the interests of a child's welfare. While children share many of the rights of adults, they face different potential harms from similar activities.

One issue that the Court considered was whether a parent's presence makes it permissible for the child to engage in actions that would otherwise be prohibited. Noting that the dangers would still exist, the Court decided that the state was free to legislate against this activity, even if adults were allowed to engage in them. The opinion noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The family itself is not beyond regulation in the public interest, as against a claim of religious liberty. And neither the rights of religion nor the rights of parenthood are beyond limitation…. The right to practice religion freely does not include the right to expose the community or the child to communicable disease or the latter to ill-health or death....
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Parents may be free to become martyrs themselves. But it does not follow they are free, in identical circumstances, to make martyrs of their children before they have reached the age of full and legal discretion when they can make that choice for themselves. Massachusetts has determined that an absolute prohibition, though one limited to streets and public places and to the incidental uses proscribed, is necessary to accomplish its legitimate objectives. Its power to attain them is broad enough to reach these peripheral instances in which the parent's supervision may reduce but cannot eliminate entirely the ill effects of the prohibited conduct. We think that with reference to the public proclaiming of religion, upon the streets and in other similar public places, the power of the state to control the conduct of children reaches beyond the scope of its authority over adults, as is true in the case of other freedoms, and the rightful boundary of its power has not been crossed in this case.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Dissenting opinions===
Justice [[Frank Murphy]] dissented: "Religious freedom is too sacred a right to be restricted or prohibited in any degree without convincing proof that a legitimate interest of the state is in grave danger."

Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]], joined by Justices [[Owen Roberts]] and [[Felix Frankfurter]], also dissented. They agreed with the judgment of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.

[[File:Gorn-1922.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Gorn'' (Furnace), an official organ of Proletkult]]
'''Proletkult''' ({{lang-rus|Пролетку́льт|p=prəlʲɪtˈkulʲt}}), a [[portmanteau]] of the Russian words "proletarskaya kultura" ([[proletarian culture]]), was an experimental Soviet artistic institution that arose in conjunction with the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917. This organization, a federation of local cultural societies and [[avant-garde]] artists, was most prominent in the visual, literary, and [[drama]]tic fields. Proletkult aspired to radically modify existing artistic forms by creating a new, revolutionary [[working class|working-class]] aesthetic, which drew its inspiration from the construction of modern industrial society in backward, agrarian Russia.

Although funded by the [[People's Commissariat for Education]] of [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]], the Proletkult organization sought autonomy from state control, a demand which brought it into conflict with the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] hierarchy and the Soviet state bureaucracy. Some top party leaders, such as [[V.I. Lenin]], sought to concentrate state funding on the basic education of the working class rather than on whimsical artistic endeavors. He and others also saw in Proletkult a hotbed of [[bourgeois]] intellectuals and potential political oppositionists.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

At its peak in 1920, Proletkult had 84,000 members actively enrolled in about 300 local studios, clubs, and factory groups, with an additional 500,000 members participating in its activities on a more casual basis.

== History ==

=== Factional background ===
[[File:A A Bogdanov.jpg|thumb|[[Bolshevik]] philosopher [[Alexander Bogdanov]], one of the founding fathers of the Proletkult movement]]

The earliest roots of the Proletarian Culture movement, better known as Proletkult, are found in the aftermath of the failed [[Revolution of 1905|1905-1907 Revolution]] against [[Nicholas II of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Mally, ''Culture of the Future: The Proletkult Movement in Revolutionary Russia.'' Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1990; pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[censorship]] apparatus of the Tsarist regime had stumbled briefly during the upheaval, broadening horizons, but the revolution had ultimately failed, resulting in dissatisfaction and second-guessing, even within [[Bolshevik Party]] ranks.

In the aftermath of the Tsar's reassertion of authority a radical political tendency known as the "[[Left Bolsheviks]]" emerged, stating their case in opposition to party leader [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].&lt;ref name=Mally4&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  This group, which included such luminaries as philosophers [[Alexander Bogdanov]] and [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] and writer [[Maxim Gorky]], argued that the [[intelligentsia]]-dominated Bolsheviks must begin following more inclusive tactics and working to develop more [[working class]] political activists to assume leadership roles in the next round of anti-Tsarist revolution.&lt;ref name=Mally4 /&gt;

Among the Left Bolsheviks, Anatoly Lunacharsky in particular had been intrigued with the possibility of making use of art as a means to inspire revolutionary political action.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, together with the celebrated Gorky, Lunacharsky hoped to found a "human religion" around the idea of [[socialism]], motivating individuals to serve a greater good outside of their own narrow self-interests.&lt;ref name=Mally5&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Working along similar lines simultaneously was Lunacharsky's brother-in-law Bogdanov, who even in 1904 had published a weighty philosophical tome called ''Empiriomonism'' which attempted to integrate the ideas of non-Marxist thinkers [[Ernst Mach]] and [[Richard Avenarius]] into the socialist edifice.&lt;ref name=Mally5 /&gt;  (Lunacharsky had studied under Avenarius in Zurich and was responsible for introducing Bogdanov to his ideas.)  Bogdanov believed that the socialist society of the future would require forging a fundamentally new perspective of the role of science, ethics, and art with respect to the individual and the state.&lt;ref name=Mally5 /&gt;

Together all these ideas of Bogdanov, Lunacharsky, Gorky, and their co-thinkers came to be known in the language of the day as "god-building" ''(bogostroitel'stvo).''&lt;ref name=Mally5 /&gt;

These ideas did not exist in a vacuum; there was a political component as well. During the period between the failure of the 1905 revolution and the outbreak of [[World War I]], Alexander Bogdanov stood as the chief rival to Lenin for leadership of the Bolshevik party.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks: Lenin and His Critics.'' Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1986; pg. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the intellectually rigid Lenin, Bogdanov was not only a political rival, but also a positive threat to the [[ideology]] of [[Marxism]]. Lenin saw Bogdanov and the "god-building" movement with which he was associated as purveyors of a reborn [[Idealism|philosophical idealism]] that stood in diametrical opposition to the fundamental [[materialism|materialist]] foundation of Marxism. So disturbed was Lenin that he spent much of 1908 combing more than 200 books to pen a thick polemical volume in reply — ''[[Materialism and Empirio-criticism|Materialism and Empirio-Criticism: Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy]].''&lt;ref&gt;For ''Materialism and Empirio-Criticism,'' see: V.I. Lenin, ''Collected Works: Volume 14.'' Abraham Fineberg, trans. Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1962; pp. 17-361. Details of Lenin's writing process may be found in the same volume, page 366, footnote 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenin ultimately emerged triumphant in the struggle for hegemony of the Bolshevik faction. Relations between them in Western European exile remained tense. During the first decade of the 20th Century Bogdanov wrote two works of [[utopianism|utopian]] [[science fiction]] about socialist societies on [[Mars]], both of which were rejected by Lenin as attempts to smuggle "Machist idealism" into the radical movement.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks,'' pp. 169-170.&lt;/ref&gt; The second of these, a book called ''Engineer Menni'' (1913), was pronounced by Lenin to be "so vague that neither a worker nor a stupid editor at ''Pravda'' [a rival publication] could understand it."&lt;ref name=Williams170&gt;Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks,'' pg. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 Bogdanov, a student of the [[Scientific management|Taylor system]] of factory work-flow rationalization, published a massive work on the topic, ''General Organizational Science,'' which Lenin liked no better.&lt;ref name="Williams170"/&gt;

The pair went their separate ways, with Bogdanov dropping out of radical politics at the end of 1913, returning home with his wife to [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks,'' pg. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; He would later be reinvigorated by the course of events to become a leading figure in the Moscow Proletkult organization — a fact which emphasizes the tension between that organization and state authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Mally argues that this traditional emphasis on Alexander Bogdanov as the "best known leader" of Proletkult helps obscure the fact that Proletkult's ongoing battle for "autonomy" ''(samostoiatel'nost')'' was in essence a fight with the state bureaucracy rather than the Communist Party, per se. See: Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The birth of Proletkult===
[[File:Moscow SpiridonovkaStreet Morozova Palace 01-2017.jpg|thumb|right|Morozova Palace, home of Proletkult]]
====Preliminary conference====
[[File:Anatoly Lunacharsky.jpg|thumb|left|Anatoly Lunacharsky, a founding father of the Proletkult organization, was People's Commissar of Education of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1929.]]

The [[February Revolution|February Revolution of 1917]] which overthrew the Tsarist regime came comparatively easily. So, too, did the [[October Revolution]] which followed, events which overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government]] of [[Alexander Kerensky]] and brought Lenin and the Bolsheviks to the seat of power. The [[Russian Civil War]] was another matter altogether — a long and brutal struggle which strained every sinew.

The radical intelligentsia of Russia was mobilized by these events. Anatoly Lunacharsky, who had briefly broken with Lenin and the Bolshevik Party to become a [[newspaper correspondent]] in [[France]] and [[Italy]], returned to Russia in May 1917 and rejoined the party in August.&lt;ref name=Fitz310&gt;Sheila Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment: Soviet Organization of Education and the Arts under Lunacharsky.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1970; pg. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the October Revolution, Lunacharsky was appointed Commissar of Education of the new regime.&lt;ref name=Fitz310 /&gt;

Lunacharsky's factional ally, Alexander Bogdanov, remained sharply critical of Lenin and his political tactics and never rejoined the Communist Party, however.&lt;ref name=Fitz295&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he served at the front as a doctor during World War I, returning home to Moscow in 1917 and becoming involved there as a founder of the Proletarian Culture organization, Proletkult.&lt;ref name=Fitz295 /&gt;

The aim of unifying the cultural and educational activities of the Russian labour movements first occurred at the Agitation Collegium of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet which met on 19 July 1917 with 120 participants. It was attended by many different currents, and when the [[Menshevik]] Dementiev suggested that the meeting just be confined to public lectures and that the [[Bolsheviks]] should be excluded, but this was soundly rejected. Consequently, the Central Council of [[Factory committee|Factory Committee]]s was instructed to work with the [[Petrograd Soviet]] to organise a second conference of "proletarian cultural-educational organizations" to bring them together in a centralized organization.&lt;ref name=Fitz89&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; A first conference of these groups was held in [[Petrograd]] from October 16 to 19, 1917 &lt;small&gt;(O.S.)&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref name=Fitz89 /&gt; The conclave was called by Lunacharsky in his role as head of the Cultural-Educational Commission of the Petrograd Bolshevik organization and was attended by 208 delegates representing Petrograd trade unions, factory committees, army and youth groups, city and regional dumas, as well as the Petrograd Committee of the Bolshevik and [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Socialist-Revolutionary]] parties.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pp. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

This October 1917 conference elected a Central Committee of Proletarian Cultural-Educational Organizations of Petrograd which included among its members Lunacharsky, Lenin's wife [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]], talented young journalist [[Larisa Reisner]], and a long-time [[Vpered]] associate of Bogdanov and Lunacharsky named [[Fedor Kalinin]], among others.&lt;ref name=Fitz90&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Also playing a key role was [[Pavel Lebedev-Polianskii]], another former member of Bogdanov and Lunacharsky's émigré political group.&lt;ref name=Fitz306&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these would be catapulted into leading roles in the People's Commissariat of Education following the Bolshevik seizure of power which followed less than two weeks later.&lt;ref name=Fitz90 /&gt;

====After the Bolshevik seizure of state power====

The October Revolution led to a marked increase in the number of new cultural organizations and informal groups.&lt;ref name=Mally33&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Clubs and cultural societies sprung up affiliated with newly empowered factories, unions, cooperatives, and [[soviet (council)|workers' and soldiers' councils]], in addition to similar groups attached to more formal institutions such as the [[Red Army]], the Communist Party, and [[Komsomol|its youth section]].&lt;ref name=Mally33 /&gt; The new government of Soviet Russia was quick to understand that these rapidly proliferating clubs and societies offered a potentially powerful vehicle for the spread of the radical political, economic, and social theories it favored.&lt;ref name=Mally33 /&gt;

The chief cultural authority of the Soviet state was its People's Commissariat of Education ([[Narkompros]]), a bureaucratic apparatus which quickly came to include no fewer than 17 different departments.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Headed by Anatoly Lunacharsky, this organization sought to expand adult literacy and to establish a broad and balanced general school curricula, in opposition to pressure from the trade unions and the [[Supreme Council of National Economy]], which sought to give preference to [[vocational education]].&lt;ref name=Mally35&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The as-yet loosely organized Proletkult movement emerged as another potential competitor to the primacy of Narkompros.

This confusing welter of competing institutions and organizations was by no means unique to the cultural field, as historian Lynn Mally has noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"All early Soviet institutions struggled against what was called 'parallelism,' the duplication of services by competing bureaucratic systems. The revolution raised difficult questions about governmental organization that were only slowly answered during the first years of the regime. Political activists disputed the authority of the central state, the role of the Communist Party within it, and the influence national agencies should wield over local groups. Altercations over scarce resources and institutional authority were intertwined with theoretical debates over the ideal structure of the new policy."&lt;ref name=Mally34&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, in the early revolutionary period control over local institutions by the central government of the Soviet state was weak, with factory workers often ignoring their trade unions and teachers the curriculum instructions of central authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt; In this political environment any centrally-devised scheme for a division of authority between Narkompros and the federated artistic societies of Proletkult remained largely a theoretical exercise. In the early days of the Bolshevik regime the local apparatus of Proletkult retained the most powerful hand.&lt;ref name=Mally36&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With its adherent Anatoly Lunacharsky at the helm of Narkompros, the Proletkult movement had an important patron with considerable influence over state policy and the purse. This did not mean an easy relationship between these institutions, however. Early in 1918 leaders of Petrograd Proletkult refused to cooperate with an effort by Narkompros to form a citywide theatre organization, declaring their refusal to work with non-proletarian theatre groups.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moscow Proletkult, in which Alexander Bogdanov played a leading role, attempted to extend its independent sphere of control even further than the Petrograd organization, addressing questions of food distribution, hygiene, vocational education, and issuing a call for establishment of a proletarian university at its founding convention in February 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Some hardliners in the Proletkult organization even insisted that Proletkult be recognized as the "ideological leader of all public education and enlightenment."&lt;ref&gt;Vasilii Ignatov, writing in ''Griadushchee'' (The Future) 1918, no. 4 (April 1918), pg. 15. Quoted in Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, however, the vision of Proletkult as the rival and guiding light of Narkompros fell by the wayside, subdued by the Proletkult's financial reliance on the Commissariat for operational funding.&lt;ref name=Mally44&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Proletkult received a budget of 9.2 million gold rubles for the first half of 1918 — nearly one-third of the entire budget for Narkompros's Adult Educational Division.&lt;ref name=Mally44 /&gt; Requisitioned buildings were put to the organization's use, with the Petrograd organization receiving a large and posh facility located on one of the city's main thoroughfares, [[Nevsky Prospect]] — the name of which was actually changed to "Proletkult Street" ''(Ulitsa Proletkul'ta)'' in the organization's honor.&lt;ref name=Mally44 /&gt;

===Development===
[[File:Plakat mayakowski gross.jpg|thumb|The poet as graphic artist: "proletarian art" in a civil war era poster by the [[Russian futurism|futurist]] poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], published by Narkompros. Mayakovsky makes use of stencil, simple agitational poetry, and primitive workerist graphics to create an almost [[folk art]] effect.]]

While the Proletkult movement began as independent groups in Petrograd (October 1917) and Moscow (February 1918), it was not long before the group's patrons in the Soviet state intervened to help forge a national organization.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet government itself moved from Petrograd to Moscow in March 1918 and the center of Proletkult's own organizational gravity shifted simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Mally45&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lines became blurred between the Proletkult organization and the Division for Proletarian Culture of the People's Commissariat of Education, headed by Proletkult activist Fyodor Kalinin.&lt;ref name=Mally45 /&gt; While the organization retained its staunch supporters in the Narkompros apparatus seeking to coordinate activities, it also contained no small number of activists like Alexander Bogdanov who tried to promote the organization as an independent cultural institution with a homogeneous working class constituency.&lt;ref name=Mally45 /&gt;

In September 1918 the first national conference of Proletkult was convened in Moscow, including 330 delegates and 234 guests from local organizations from around Soviet Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; While no delegate list has survived, the stenogram of the conference indicates that the bulk of attendees hailed from trade unions, factory organizations, cooperatives, and workers' clubs.&lt;ref name=Mally46&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates were split between those favoring an autonomous and leading role for the organization in general education in Soviet society and those who favored a more narrow focus for the group as a subordinate part of the Narkompros bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

While those favoring autonomy were in the majority at the first national conference, the ongoing problem of organizational finance remained a real one, as historian Lynn Mally has observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Although the Proletkult was autonomous, it still expected Narkompros to foot the bills. The government would supply the central Proletkult with a subsidy, to be distributed among provincial affiliates. But because financial dependence on the state clearly contradicted the organization's claims to independence, the central leaders held out the hope that their affiliates would soon discover their own means of support."&lt;ref name=Mally48&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proletkult and its desire for autonomy also had another powerful patron in the person of [[Nikolai Bukharin]], editor of ''[[Pravda]].''&lt;ref name=Fitz94&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Bukharin provided favorable coverage for Proletkult during the organization's formative period, welcoming the idea that the group represented a "laboratory of pure proletarian ideology" with a legitimate claim to independence from Soviet governmental control.&lt;ref name=Fitz94 /&gt;

Proletkult made use of different organizational forms. In large industrial cities, the organization set up an elaborate bureaucratic apparatus resembling that of Narkompros.&lt;ref name=Fitz98&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow Proletkult, for example, had departments for literary publishing, theatre, music, art, and clubs.&lt;ref name=Fitz98 /&gt; In addition to this central bureaucracy, Proletkult established factory cells attached to the highly concentrated mills and manufacturing facilities.&lt;ref name=Fitz98 /&gt; Finally, Proletkult established "studios" — independent facilities in which workers learned and developed the techniques of the various arts.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narkompros, for its part, sought to influence Proletkult to concentrate its efforts upon the expansion of the network of studios.&lt;ref name=Fitz99&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1919 People's Commissar of Education Lunacharsky declared that Proletkult "should concentrate all its attention on studio work, on the discovery and encouragement of original talent among the workers, on the creation of circles of writers, artists, and all kinds of young scholars from the working class..."&lt;ref&gt;A. Lunacharsky, "Once Again on Proletkult and Soviet Cultural Organizations," ''Izvestiia VTsIK,'' No. 80 (April 13, 1919), pg. 2. Quoted in Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proletkult and its studios and clubs gained a certain measure of popularity among a broad segment of the urban Russian population, particularly factory workers.&lt;ref name=Siegelbaum&gt;Lewis H. Siegelbaum, ''Soviet State and Society Between Revolutions, 1918-1929.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1992; pg. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1918 the organization counted 147 local affiliates, although the actual number of functioning units was probably somewhat fewer.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 51. See especially footnote 57 on that page.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the peak of the organization's strength in 1920, Proletkult claimed a total of 84,000 members in 300 local groups, with an additional 500,000 more casual followers.&lt;ref&gt;Siegelbaum, ''Soviet State and Society Between Revolutions, 1918-1929,'' pp. 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 15 different Proletkult periodicals were produced over the course of the organization's short existence,&lt;ref name=Maguire157&gt;Robert A. Maguire, ''Red Virgin Soil: Soviet Literature in the 1920s.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1968; pg. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; including most importantly ''Proletarskaia kultura'' (Proletarian Culture — 1918 to 1921) and ''Gorn'' (Furnace — 1918 to 1923).&lt;ref&gt;[http://feb-web.ru/feb/litenc/encyclop/le9/le9-5192.htm "Пролеткульт,"] (Proletkult). Fundamental Electronic Library of Russian Literature and Folklore, feb-web.ru/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideology===

Historically the relationship between the Russian liberal [[intelligentsia]] and the working class was that of teacher and student.&lt;ref name=CultFront19&gt;Sheila Fitzpatrick, ''The Cultural Front: Power and Culture in Revolutionary Russia.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1992; pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; This situation presumed a "higher" level of culture on the part of the aristocratic teachers — an accepted premise of the Bolsheviks themselves during the pre-revolutionary period.&lt;ref name=CultFront19 /&gt;

Under Marxist theory, however, culture was conceived as a part of the [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] associated with the dominant class in society — in the Russian instance, that of the [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref name=CultFront20&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Cultural Front,'' pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Under a workers' state, some [[theoretician (Marxism)|Marxist theoreticians]] believed, the new proletarian ruling class would develop its own distinct class culture to supplant the former culture of the old ruling order.&lt;ref name=CultFront20 /&gt; Proletkult was seen as a primary vehicle for the development of this new "proletarian culture."

The nature and function of Proletkult was described by [[Platon Kerzhentsev]], one of the movement's top leaders in 1919:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The task of the 'Proletkults' is the development of an independent proletarian spiritual culture, including all areas of the human spirit — science, art, and everyday life. The new socialist epoch must produce a new culture, the foundations of which are already being laid. This culture will be the fruit of the creative efforts of the working class and will be entirely independent. Work on behalf of proletarian culture should stand on a par with the political and economic struggle of the working class.

"But in creating its own culture, the working class by no means should reject the rich cultural heritage of the past, the material and spiritual achievements, made by classes which are alien and hostile to the proletariat. The proletarian must look it over critically, choose what is of value, elucidate it with his own point of view, use it with a view to producing his own culture. *  *  *

"This work on a new culture ought to proceed along a completely independent path. 'Proletkults' should be class-restricted, workers' organizations, completely autonomous in their activities."&lt;ref&gt;V. Kerzhentsev, ''Oktiabr'skii perevorot i diktatura proletariata'' (The October Overturn and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat). Moscow: 1919;  pp. 154-161. Reprinted in William G. Rosenberg (ed.), ''Bolshevik Visions: First Phase of the Cultural Revolution in Soviet Russia.'' Second Edition. Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 1990; pp. 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proletkult's theorists generally espoused a hardline [[economic determinism]], arguing that only purely working class organizations were capable of advancing the cause of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; An early editorial from the official Proletkult journal ''Proletarskaia Kultura'' (Proletarian Culture) demanded that "the proletariat start right now, immediately, to create its own ''socialist forms of thought, feeling, and daily life,'' independent of alliances or combinations of political forces."&lt;ref&gt;"From the Editors," ''Proletarskaia Kul'tura,'' 1918, no. 3 (March 1918), pg. 36. Emphasis in original. Quoted in Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the view of Alexander Bogdanov and other Proletkult theoreticians, the arts were not the province of a specially gifted elite, but rather were the physical output of individuals with a set of learned skills.&lt;ref name=Maguire157 /&gt; All that was required, it was assumed, was for one to study basic artistic technique in a very few lessons, after which anyone was capable of becoming a proletarian artist.&lt;ref name=Maguire157 /&gt; The movement by Proletkult to establish a network of studios in which workers could enroll was seen as an essential part of training this new cohort of proletarian artists.&lt;ref name=Maguire157 /&gt;

Despite the organization's rhetoric about its proletarian exclusivity, however, the movement was guided by intellectuals throughout its entire brief history, with its efforts to promote workers from the bench to leadership positions largely unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Siegelbaum, ''Soviet State and Society Between Revolutions, 1918-1929,'' pg. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on the various arts===

====Literature====

Proletkult expended great energy in attempting to launch a wave of worker-poets, with only limited artistic success. The insistence upon developing new poets of questionable talent led to a split of the Proletkult in 1919, when a large group of young writers, most of whom were poets, broke from the organization due to what they believed to be a stifling of individual creative talent.&lt;ref name=Maguire158&gt;Maguire, ''Red Virgin Soil,'' pg. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

These defectors from Proletkult initially formed a small, elite organization called Kuznitza (The Forge) before again launching a new [[mass organization]] known as the [[All-Russian Association of Proletarian Writers]] (VAPP) a year later.&lt;ref name=Maguire158 /&gt;

====Theater====
{{main|Proletcult Theatre}}
The Proletkult organizations of Petrograd and Moscow controlled their own dramatic theatrical network, including under its umbrella a number of smaller city clubs maintaining their own theatrical studios.&lt;ref name=Acts31&gt;Lynn Mally, ''Revolutionary Acts: Amateur Theater and the Soviet State, 1917-1938.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2000; pg. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrograd Proletkult opened a large central studio early in 1918 which staged a number of new and experimental works with a view to inspiring similar performances in other amateur theaters around the city.&lt;ref name=Acts31 /&gt; Moscow Proletkult opened its own central theater several months later.&lt;ref name=Acts31 /&gt;

Proletkult constituted the leading center of a radical minority within the theatrical community of the day which aspired to promote so-called "proletarian theater."&lt;ref name=Acts22&gt;Mally, ''Revolutionary Acts,'' pg. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Development of this new form was defined in one early conference resolution as "the task of workers themselves, along with those peasants who are willing to accept their ideology."&lt;ref name=Acts22 /&gt; Conventional modes of performance were discouraged, in favor of unconventional stagings designed to promote "mass action" — including public processions, festivals, and social dramas.&lt;ref name=Acts22 /&gt;

===Contemporary criticism===

Artists in the Proletkult movement, while not by any means a homogeneous bloc, were influenced to a great extent by the [[iconoclasm]], technological orientation, and revolutionary enthusiasm bound up in the thematic movements of the day, [[Russian futurism|futurism]] and [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]].&lt;ref name=Fitz100&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite lip service paid to classical forms of poetry, drama, writing, sculpture, and painting, strong encouragement was given to the use of new techniques and forms in so-called "proletarian art," including the use of photography, cinematography, and collage.&lt;ref name=Fitz100 /&gt;

This commitment to experimentalism drew the fire of those party leaders who preferred more classical modes of artistic expression. Petrograd Communist Party leader [[Grigory Zinoviev]]  took the lead at a conference of "proletarian writers" held in that city in the fall of 1919, declaring that while previously "we allowed the most nonsensical futurism to get a reputation almost as the official school of Communist art" and let "doubtful elements attach themselves to our Proletkults."&lt;ref name=Zin&gt;Quoted in Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; it was henceforth "time to put an end to this," Zinoviev demanded.&lt;ref name=Zin /&gt;

Also among those critical of the Proletkult movement and its vision to create a wholly new proletarian culture was top Soviet party leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]. At a public speech in May 1919 Lenin declared any notions of so-called "proletarian culture" to be "fantasies" which he opposed with "ruthless hostility."&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Lenin, ''Polnoe sobranie sochineniia: Tom 38, Mart—Iiun' 1919.'' Moscow: Politizdat, 1969; pp. 368-369. Quoted in Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, Lenin had profound misgivings about the entire institution of Proletkult, viewing it as (in historian [[Sheila Fitzpatrick|Sheila Fitzpatrick's]] words) "an organization where futurists, idealists, and other undesirable bourgeois artists and intellectuals addled the minds of workers who needed basic education and culture..."&lt;ref name=CultFront22&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Cultural Front,'' pg. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin also may have had political misgivings about the organization as a potential base of power for his long-time rival [[Alexander Bogdanov]] or for ultra-radical [[Left communism|"Left Communists"]] and the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] dissidents who comprised the [[Workers' Opposition]].&lt;ref name=CultFront22 /&gt;

===Dissolution===
[[File:Vintage Potemkin.jpg|thumb|The ethic of Proletkult is found in the early cinematic works of Sergei Eisenstein. This promotional poster for his 1926 film ''The Battleship Potemkin'' making use of indistinct masses of people and diagonal lines is exemplary of [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]].]]

By the fall of 1920 it became increasingly clear that the Soviet regime would emerge from the Russian Civil War victorious. With fall of the [[White movement|Whites]], a common enemy which united disparate factions around the Soviet banner, much unity was loosened. Dissident groups such as the so-called Workers' Opposition and the [[Group of Democratic Centralism|Democratic Centralists]] emerged in the Communist Party, widespread dissatisfaction among the [[peasantry]] over forced grain requisitioning resulted in isolated uprisings. All of these factors prompted a wave of debate about the institutions that had sprung up in Soviet society during wartime, including Proletkult.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its short history, Proletkult had sought both autonomy from state control and hegemony in the cultural field. This had created a substantial number of critics and rivals. These included leaders of the Soviet trade union movement, who saw the management of workers' cultural opportunities as part of their own purview; local Communist Party committees, which sought centralization under their own direction rather than a hode-podge of autonomous civic institutions; and the People's Commissariat of Education (Narkompros), which believed its own mission included the cultural training of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 196-197.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, Narkompros proved the most outspoken and unyielding in its criticism.&lt;ref name=Mally197&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since 1918 [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]] — the wife of Vladimir Lenin — had sought to reign in Proletkult and integrate it under the agency in which she herself played a leading role, the Adult Education Division of Narkompros.&lt;ref name=Mally197 /&gt; A May 1919 conference of adult education workers had, spurred on by Krupskaya, determined that Proletkult was an adult education agency owing to its studio system, and therefore rightfully part of Narkompros.&lt;ref name=Mally197 /&gt;

Bureaucratic wrangling between top leaders of Proletkult and the Adult Education Division of Narkompros had produced a working agreement in the summer of 1919 bringing Proletkult formally under the auspices of the latter, albeit with its own separate budget.&lt;ref name=Mally198&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; This proved, however, to be a stop-gap and institutional conflict remained.&lt;ref name=Mally198 /&gt;

Proletkult leaders subsequently made an effort to expand their movement on an international basis at the [[2nd World Congress of the Comintern|2nd World Congress of the Communist International]] in August 1920, founding [[Kultintern]], an international organization headed by Anatoly Lunacharsky.&lt;ref name=Mally200&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; The group's grandiose vision and practical efforts to expand the Proletkult movement globally was particularly concerning to Lenin, himself a man of staid and traditional cultural tastes who had already come to see Proletkult as utopian and wasteful.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 199, 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spurred to action by Lenin, in the fall of 1920 the governing Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) &lt;!---this is the correct name and capitalization for the organization---&gt; began to take an active interest in the relationship of Proletkult with other Soviet institutions for the first time.&lt;ref name=Mally198 /&gt; Lenin sought and obtained information from [[M. N. Pokrovsky|M.N. Pokrovsky]], second in command at Narkompros, and top Proletkult leaders about the organization's budget and semi-independent status and pushed through a decision to absorb Proletkult into Narkompros to end the situation of parallelism once and for all.&lt;ref name=Mally201&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

The already scheduled National Congress of Proletkult, held in Moscow from October 5 to 12, 1920, was to be the occasion for the announcement.&lt;ref name=Mally201 /&gt; While Lunacharsky, head of Narkompros but a patron of Proletkult and its interests, dragged his feet on the merger, the congress eventually — following long debate and a stern appeal to party discipline — formally approved the Central Committee's decision to directly integrate Proletkult into Narkompros.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 201-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The integration was not a smooth one, however, and Proletkult activists fought to the last ditch to retain organizational autonomy even within Narkompros.&lt;ref name=Mally203&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Committee reacted with a scathing decree denouncing Proletkult that was published in ''Pravda'' on December 1, 1920.

===Legacy===

Despite its formal termination as an organization, the Proletkult movement continued to influence and inform early Soviet culture. Historian Peter Kenez has noted the heavy influence of the Proletkult ethic in the work of pioneer Soviet filmmaker [[Sergei Eisenstein]], director of the classic films ''[[Strike (1925 film)|Strike]]'' (1925), ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1926), and ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World]]'' (1927):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The intellectual content of [Eisenstein's] early films was profoundly influenced by his earlier association with Proletkult, a complex politicocultural movement that reached the height of its influence during the revolutionary period.... [Its leaders] argued that the new, socialist culture would be profoundly different from what it replaced. In their view there could be no accommodation with the old world; the proletariat on the basis of its experience would create a new culture that would reflect the spirit of the collective. It followed that the new art had to emphasize not the accomplishments of individuals but those of the workers and peasants. Eisenstein was attracted to this movement because it justified the necessity of a complete break with the art of the '[[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]' world. All of his early films expressed, though in his own idiom, the ideology of Proletkult."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kenez, ''Cinema and Soviet Society, 1917-1953.'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992; pg. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3920">The '''''Reichserbhofgesetz(hereditary)''''' (Eng: land heritage law or the State Hereditary Farm Law of 1933) was a Nazi law to implement principles of [[Blood and Soil|blood and soil]], stating that its aim was to: "preserve the farming community as the blood-source of the German people" (''Das Bauerntum als Blutquelle des deutschen Volkes erhalten''). A Greater [[Aryan certificate]] was required to receive its benefits, similar to the requirements for becoming a member of the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP).

Selected lands were declared hereditary, as an ''Erbhof'', to pass from father to son, and could not be mortgaged or alienated, and only these farmers were entitled to call themselves ''Bauern'' or "farmer peasant", a term the Nazis attempted to refurbish from a neutral or even pejorative to a positive term.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Grunberger]], ''The 12-Year Reich'', pp 156-7, {{ISBN|0-03-076435-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regional custom was only allowed to decide whether the eldest or the youngest son was to be the heir. In areas where no particular custom prevailed, the youngest son was to be the heir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verfassungen.de/de/de33-45/reichserbhof33.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gFkXIIikjbIC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=%22Reichserbhofgesetz%22+%22j%C3%BCngsten+sohn%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wB8sUGZbwO&amp;sig=kjo_5QrR5Uxespf_v_jzLYpjQ1s&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2jNaUeH8KYirOrn0gdgE&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Reichserbhofgesetz%22%20%22j%C3%BCngsten%20sohn%22&amp;f=false Daniela Münkel, Nationalsozialistische Agrarpolitik und Bauernalltag] p.116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/3/465.full.pdf G.K.

As peasants appeared in Nazi ideology as a source of economics and racial stability, the law was implemented to protect them from the forces of modernization.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=1550 The Hereditary Farm Law (September 29, 1933)]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Only about 35% of all farming units were covered by it.&lt;ref name="Schoenbaum164"&gt;[[David Schoenbaum]], ''Hitler's Social Revolution: Class and Status in Nazi Germany, 1933-1939'', p 164 Garden City, NY Doubleday, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;  In theory, any farm of 7.5 to 125 hectares (19–309&amp;nbsp;acres) could be declared ''Erbhof'', as the size needed to maintain a family and act as a productive unit; larger farms would have to be subdivided.&lt;ref name="Schoenbaum164"/&gt;

[[Richard Walther Darré]], in accordance with his strong "[[blood and soil]]" beliefs, did much to promote it as the Reich Minister of Food and Agriculture and ''Reichsbauernführer''.

The '''Romanian Socialist Party''' ({{lang-ro|Partidul Socialist Român}}) was a minor Romanian political party with a socialist ideology. It was briefly represented in the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]] after two deputies, elected on the [[Greater Romania Party]] list, joined the organisation in 2002. The two MPs would leave the party the following year in order to create the [[United Socialist Party (Romania)|United Socialist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mesca si Neacsu si-au facut partid nou|url=http://adevarul.ro/news/politica/mesca-neacsu-si-au-facut-partid-nou-1_50abad967c42d5a6637e55d3/index.html|website=Adevărul.ro|publisher=[[Adevărul|Adevărul Holding]]|accessdate=8 September 2016|date=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Romanian legislative election, 2008|2008 elections]], it won 0.01% of the vote in the Chamber of Deputies and 0.02% in the Senate.

The '''rule of thirds''' is a [[rule of thumb]] used when planning for the deployment and usage of a [[military organisation]], according to which one third of the total military forces involved should be available for operations, one third should be preparing for operations and the final third, having been on operations, should be recuperating. Ideally, units and individuals regularly will rotate through each of the three phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holmes|first=Charles|title=The One Thirds Two Thirds 1/3 – 2/3 Rule for Military Leaders|url=http://www.part-time-commander.com/the-one-thirds-two-thirds-13-23-rule-for-military-leaders/|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grimes|first=Major Gary R.|title=Battle Staff Drill for Logisticians|url=http://www.almc.army.mil/alog/issues/jul97/MS099.htm|publisher=Army Logistics University|accessdate=19 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327144146/http://www.almc.army.mil/alog/issues/jul97/MS099.htm|archivedate=27 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations and implications==
Different nations and militaries will vary the rule of thirds according to their own financial and manpower situations. 

At times of financial constraint, rather than increasing the total number of forces, one temptation of politicians is to attempt to increase available manpower by folding together the preparation and recuperation phases, creating a ''rule of halves''. A rule of halves was actually the basis of British Army planning during the British Empire,{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} with each regiment consisting of a pair of battalions which would take turns recruiting, training and recuperating in the UK, and then being deployed overseas. However, because of the nature of transportation in the past, each of the phases at that time were longer (being a year or more) than is currently the case. Departing from a three-phase rotation for short periods is not impossible, but prolonged deployment is detrimental both to the psychological health of service personnel, and to the operational life of equipment, leading to an unwanted turnover in personnel, and to premature failure of equipment. For those military operations that are able to afford it, going to a four- or five-phase rotation schedule actually increases a nation's ability to conduct sustained military operations, even though it may appear that the majority of its servicemen are not doing anything{{Citation needed||date=April 2018}}.

As a critical cornerstone of their defence policies, the British and French [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] forces uses a ''rule of fourths'',{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} where one submarine is on patrol, one is preparing to go on patrol, one returns from patrol, and the fourth is in [[preventive maintenance|maintenance]]. This force structure ensures that they will always have at least one ballistic missile boat on patrol at any one time.

The United States, in order to keep the maximum number of its submarines available at any one time, assigns two crews, called gold and blue, to each of its submarines, with the submarines themselves having a turnaround time that is as short as possible.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} However, the United States is one of the few nations that can afford both the manpower costs of doing this, while still being able to ensure that enough boats are in service to have the ability regularly to stagger boats out for deep maintenance without appreciably affecting the total number available.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

'''Self-censorship''' is the act of [[censorship|censoring]] or [[Classified Information|classifying]] one's own [[discourse]]. This is done out of fear of, or deference to, the sensibilities or preferences (actual or perceived) of others and without overt pressure from any specific party or institution of authority. Self-censorship is often practiced by [[film producer]]s, [[film director]]s, [[publisher]]s, [[news anchor]]s, [[journalist]]s, [[musician]]s, and other kinds of [[author]]s including individuals who use [[social media]].

In [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries, creators of artworks may remove material that their government might find controversial for fear of sanction by their governments. In [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] [[capitalism|capitalist]] countries, repressive [[judicial activism|judicial lawmaking]] can also cause widespread [[River crab (Internet slang)|"rivercrabbing"]] of Western media.&lt;ref name="RC"&gt;{{Cite web |author= Steven Swinford | title = Ryan Giggs: from golden boy to tarnished idol | work = The Telegraph | date = 23 May 2011 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/8532042/Ryan-Giggs-from-golden-boy-to-tarnished-idol.html | accessdate = 28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-censorship can also occur in order to conform to the expectations of the market. For example, the editor of a periodical may consciously or unconsciously avoid topics that will anger advertisers, customers, or the owners in order to protect her or his livelihood either directly (i.e., fear of losing his job) or indirectly (e.g., a belief that a book will be more profitable if it does not contain offensive material). This phenomenon is referred to as [[Independent Media#Soft censorship|soft censorship]].

Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] guarantees [[freedom of speech]] from all forms of censorship. Article 19 explicitly states that “everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”&lt;ref&gt;University of Salzburg, 
[http://www.salzburg.umd.edu/media-innovation/journalism-self-censorship Journalism Self-Censorship, Global Self-Censorship Struggles: Lebanon, Mexico, China, Hong Kong and Slovakia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209093642/http://www.salzburg.umd.edu/media-innovation/journalism-self-censorship |date=December 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Freedom of Expression ==
[[File:Males-2358244 1920.jpg|thumb]]
People often communicate to affirm one’s identity and sense of belonging.  People may express their opinions or withhold their opinions due to the fear of exclusion or unpopularity.  Shared social norms and beliefs create a sense of belonging, but they can also create a suppression of expression in order to comply or belong.  People may adjust their beliefs or opinions to go along with the majority attitude.  There are different factors that contribute to self-censorship such as gender, age, education, political interests and media exposure.  For some, the reason for their change in beliefs and opinions are rooted in fear of isolation and exclusion.  The risk of negative reactions is greater than expressing one’s true beliefs. 

==Journalism==
{{See also|Freedom of the press}}
Journalists often censor themselves due to threats against them or their interests from another party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/06/29/milk.security/index.html |title=Milk-threat study issued over objections |publisher=CNN.com |author=Jeanne Meserve |date=June 29, 2005 |accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; editorial instructions from their supervisor[s], perceived conflicts of interest with a media organization's economic sponsors, advertisers or shareholders,&lt;ref name="Noam Chomsky 1994"&gt;Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky ''Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media'', Vintage, 1994, {{ISBN|0-09-953311-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.). Self-censorship occurs when journalists deliberately manipulate their expression out of fear of, or deference to, the sensibilities or preferences (actual or perceived) of others and without overt pressure from any specific party or institution of authority. Self-censorship of journalists is most pervasive in societies where governments have official [[media censorship]] policies and where journalists will be jailed, fined, or simply lose their job if they do not follow the censorship rules.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
Organizations such as ([[Media Matters for America]],&lt;ref&gt;Media Matters for America: [http://mediamatters.org/items/200407140002 33 internal Fox editorial memos reviewed by MMFA reveal]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]],&lt;ref&gt;FAIR: [http://www.fair.org/media-woes/censorship.html Censorship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050118214825/http://www.fair.org/media-woes/censorship.html |date=2005-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]) have raised concerns about news broadcasting stations, particularly [[Fox News]], censoring their own content to be less controversial when reporting on certain types of issues such as the [[War on Terror]].

In their book ''[[Manufacturing Consent]]'' (1988), [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Edward S. Herman|Edward Herman]] argue that corporate ownership of news media very strongly encourages systematic self-censorship owing to market forces.&lt;ref name="Noam Chomsky 1994"/&gt; In this argument, even with supposedly liberal media, bias and (often unconscious) self-censorship is evident in the selection and omission of news stories, and the framing of acceptable discussion, in line with the interests of the corporations owning those media.

The [[journalism|journalists]] have actively sought censorship advice from military authorities in order to prevent the inadvertent revelation of military secrets. In 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' succeeded in suppressing news of a reporter's abduction by [[Terrorist|militants]] in [[Afghanistan]] for seven months until his escape from captivity in order to 'reduce danger to the reporter and other hostages'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090620/ap_on_re_as/as_afghan_nyt_reporter |title=New York Times reporter escapes Taliban captivity |publisher=Associated Press |author=JASON STRAZIUSO |date=June 20, 2005 |accessdate=2009-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623101727/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090620/ap_on_re_as/as_afghan_nyt_reporter |archivedate=June 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists have sometimes self-censored publications of news stories out of concern for the safety of people involved. Jean Pelletier, the Washington D.C. correspondent for the Montreal ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' newspaper, uncovered a covert attempt by the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]] to smuggle US diplomats out of [[Iran]] during the [[Iranian Hostage Crisis]] before the "[[Canadian Caper]]" had reached its conclusion. In order to preserve the safety of those involved, he refused to allow the paper to publish the story until the hostages had left Iran, despite the considerable news value to the paper and writer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Self-censorship became a quite frequent practice in Russia after 2000's government take-overs and consolidation of media, further deepened after 2014-2015 laws on 'undesirable organisations'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Russia's 'Undesirables' Law Expected to Boost Media Self-Censorship {{!}} News|url = http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russias-undesirables-law-expected-to-boost-media-self-censorship/522228.html|accessdate = 2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newspaper censors its own interview with Russian opposition leader, removing criticism of Putin and others|url = https://meduza.io/en/news/2015/09/07/newspaper-censors-its-own-interview-with-russian-opposition-leader-removing-criticism-of-putin-and-others|accessdate = 2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.gwu.edu/~ieresgwu/assets/docs/demokratizatsiya%20archive/GWASHU_DEMO_22_2/Q0004344847N3648/Q0004344847N3648.pdf|title = Coercion or Conformism?

===Europe===
As for Europe, threats to media freedom have shown a significant increase in recent years. Journalists and whistleblowers have experienced physical and psychological intimidation and threats. Self-censorship is one of the major consequences of such circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/human-rights-rule-of-law/-/new-study-on-intimidation-of-journalists-and-self-censorship-in-europe?desktop=false|title=New study on intimidation of journalists and self-censorship in Europe|last=|first=|date=20 April 2017|work=Council of Europe.

A study published in 2017 by the [[Council of Europe]] found that in the period 2014-2016 that 40% of journalists involved in the survey experienced some kind of unwarranted interference, in particular psychological violence, including slandering and smear campaigning, cyberbulling. Other forms of unwarranted interference include intimidation by interest groups, threats with force, intimidation by political groups, targeted surveillance, intimidation by the police, etc. In terms of geography, cases of physical assault were more common in the South Caucasus, followed by Turkey, but were present in othe region as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Politics==

[[James Gomez]] writes about this phenomenon in his book [https://monash.academia.edu/JamesGomez/Books/157922/Self-Censorship--Singapore-s-Shame/ ''Self-Censorship: Singapore's Shame'']. He argues that citizens and foreigners in Singapore practice self-censorship that results in the censorship of others when it comes to political matters.

==Religion==
[[File:Bible-2167783 1920.jpg|thumb]]
Religious affiliation is a topic that many occupational fields and areas that may be a source of self-censorship.  One particular area is psychology.  From the origins of psychology, the field has frequently viewed religion with distrust. Psychologists and therapists often refrain from claiming to be part of any religion believing in the possibility that any expressions of any devout faith may be viewed as markers for mental illness or distress.  A 2013 survey from the American Psychological Association (APA) found that “relative to the general population, psychologists were more than twice likely to claim no religion, three times more likely to describe religion as unimportant in their lives, and five times more likely to deny belief in God.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosik, Christopher H.; Teraoka, Nicole A.; Moretto, James D|first=|date=2016|title=Religiously-based prejudice and self-censorship: Perceptions and experiences among Christian therapists and educators|url=|journal=Journal of Psychology and Christianity|volume=|pages=52-67|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a religious movement it is more common among fundamentalist believers like [[Wahhabism]], [[Islamism]], [[Calvinism]], and [[Hasidic Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0378.2006.00241.x/abstract|title=Religion in the Public Sphere | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0378.2006.00241.x | volume=14|journal=European Journal of Philosophy|pages=1–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

==Science==

Self-censorship in scientific publications that have been criticized as politically motivated include scientists under the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] withholding findings that disagreed with the commonly held beliefs in differences between races, or the refusal of these scientists under [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] to support [[General Relativity]] (which got the reputation as "Jewish science"). More recently, certain scientists have withheld their findings related to [[climate change]]s caused by pollution and to endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/11/tech/main673232.shtml |title=Scientific Method: Self-Censorship, Study Finds Researchers Shy Away From Controversial Projects |publisher=CBS News |author=Ayaz Nanji |date=February 11, 2005  |accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-scientists10feb10,0,4954654.story?coll=la-home-nation |title=U.S. Scientists Say They Are Told to Alter Findings |publisher=Los Angeles Times |author=Julie Cart |page=A-13 |date=February 10, 2005 |accessdate=2008-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050224091757/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-scientists10feb10,0,4954654.story?coll=la-home-nation |archivedate=February 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/17/60minutes/main1415985.shtml |title=Rewriting The Science, Scientist Says Politicians Edit Global Warming Research |publisher=CBS News |author=Daniel Schorn |date=July 30, 2006 |accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Heinz Klatt]] argues that [[hate speech|hate laws]], [[speech code]]s, cowardice, and [[political correctness]] have resulted in an intellectually repressive atmosphere in modern-day academic circles, with widespread self-censorship on topics like homosexuality, (learning) disabilities, Islam, and genetic differences between human races and sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/article.cfm?section=Opinions&amp;articleID=1099 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221043937/http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/article.cfm?section=Opinions&amp;articleID=1099 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 21, 2009 |title=Self-censorship the bane of academic life |publisher=The Gazette (University of Western Ontario) |author=Heinz Klatt |date=October 27, 2006 |accessdate=2008-09-27 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Risks from scientific publications===

In the early days of [[atomic physics]], it was realized that discoveries regarding [[nuclear fission]] and the chain reaction might be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes - on the one hand, such discoveries could have important applications for medicine and energy production, however on the other hand, they might also lead to the production of unprecedented [[weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schweber|first1=Silvan S.|title=In the Shadow of the Bomb: Oppenheimer, Bethe, and the Moral Responsibility of the Scientist|isbn=978-0691127859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leo Szilard argues that if dangerous discoveries were kept secret, the development and use of such weapons might be avoided.&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite web|last1=Selgelid|first1=Michael J.|title=Governance of dual-use research: an ethical dilemma|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/9/08-051383/en/|publisher=World health Organization|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to nuclear fission findings in the field of medicine and biotechnology could facilitate production of biological weapons of mass destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The darker bioweapons future|url=https://fas.org/irp/cia/product/bw1103.pdf|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=15 February 2016|date=November 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Broad|first1=William J.|title=Bioterror Researchers Build A More Lethal Mousepox|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/01/us/bioterror-researchers-build-a-more-lethal-mousepox.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=15 February 2016|date=November 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nowak|first1=Rachel|title=Killer mousepox virus raises bioterror fears|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn311-killer-mousepox-virus-raises-bioterror-fears/|publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=15 February 2016|date=10 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 members of the Journal Editors and Authors Group, 32 leading journal editors, perceived the threat from [[biological warfare]] as sufficiently high to warrant a system of self-censorship on the public dissemination of certain aspects of their community's research. The statement agreed on declared:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Units/spru/hsp/documents/Reactions%20to%20Selfcensorship.pdf | title=Reactions to Self-censorship | date=2003 | accessdate=15 February 2016 | author=McLeish, C.A. | pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We recognize that the prospect of [[bioterrorism]] has raised legitimate concerns about the potential abuse of published information… We are committed to dealing responsibly and effectively with safety and security issues that may be raised by papers submitted for publication, and to increasing our capacity to identify such issues as they arise…[O]n occasions an editor may conclude that the potential harm of publication outweighs the potential societal benefits… the paper should be modified, or not be published…&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Taste and decency==
[[Taste (sociology)|Taste]] and [[decency]] are other areas in which questions are often raised regarding self-censorship. Art or journalism involving images or footage of [[murder]], [[terrorism]], [[war]] and [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacres]] may cause complaints as to the purpose to which they are put.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} [[Curator]]s and [[Editing|editors]] will frequently censor these images to avoid charges of [[prurience]], [[shock tactic]]s or [[invasion of privacy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  When the director of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, for example, was interviewed regarding his decision to whitewash an antiwar mural showing dollar-draped military coffins, he speculated that the mural would have offended the community in which it was placed.  He then added that "there were zero complaints, because I took care of it right away,"&lt;ref name=deitch&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-1214-moca-mural-20101214,0,4436829.story |title=Museum of Contemporary Art commissions, then paints over, artwork |author=Finkel, Jori |publisher=''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' |date=2010-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; a comment that practically defines the present topic.

In management and engineering, [[groupthink]] exists regarding matters of taste as they affect what products are acceptable for use by the public, but is not usually recognized as such.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Self-censorship can be considered as a method of [[Preventive healthcare|preventive medicine]] and health maintenance: it stands in connection with the development of the [[information society]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/events/infoday/2007/gares.shtml Resolution A/RES/60/252, dated 27 April 2006, adopted by the UN General Assembly on World Summit on the Information Society].&lt;/ref&gt; [[information overload]] and [[information pollution]], the evolving [[information ecology]] and is associated with [[informational hygiene]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240515256_Information_ecology__a_viewpoint?ev=prf_pub Eryomin A.L.

'''Sovietization''' ({{lang-ru|Советизация|italic=yes}}) is the adoption of a political system based on the model of [[soviet (council)|soviet]]s (workers' councils) or the adoption of a way of life and mentality modelled after the [[Soviet Union]].

A notable wave of Sovietization (in the second meaning) occurred in [[Mongolia]] and later during and after [[World War II]] in [[Central Europe]] (Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland etc.). In a broad sense, this included (voluntary and involuntary) adoption of Soviet-like institutions, laws, customs, traditions and the Soviet way of life, both on a national level and in smaller communities. This was usually promoted and sped up by [[propaganda]] aimed at creating a common way of life in all states within the [[Soviet sphere of influence]]. In many cases, Sovietization was also accompanied by forced resettlement of large categories of "[[class enemies]]" ([[kulak]]s, or ''[[osadnik]]s'', for instance) to the [[Gulag]] [[labor camp]]s and [[Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union|exile settlements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author =various authors | coauthors = | title =Demography and National Security | year =2001 | editor =[[Myron Weiner]], Sharon Stanton Russell | pages =308–315 | chapter =Stalinist Forced Relocation Policies | chapterurl =https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN157181339X&amp;id=J9nuv7MGQ5MC&amp;pg=PA309&amp;lpg=PA309&amp;dq=Sovietization&amp;sig=QTVI52AN1LIHVn13mJYNqUyNCNw | publisher =Berghahn Books | location = | isbn =1-57181-339-X| url = | format = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a narrow sense, the term ''Sovietization'' is often applied to mental and social changes within the population of the Soviet Union and its satellites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author =[[Józef Tischner]] | coauthors = | title =Etyka solidarności oraz Homo sovieticus | year =2005 | editor =  | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =Znak | location =Kraków | isbn =83-240-0588-9 | url = | format = | accessdate =| page =295 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to creation of the ''[[new Soviet man]]'' (according to its supporters) or ''[[Homo Sovieticus]]'' (according to its critics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author =[[Aleksandr Zinovyev]] | coauthors = | title =Homo sovieticus | year =1986 | editor = | pages = | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =Grove/Atlantic | location = | isbn =0-87113-080-7 | url = | format = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Stored Communications Act''' ('''SCA''', [[codification (law)|codified]] at [[Title 18 of the United States Code|18 U.S.C.]] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-121 Chapter 121] §§&amp;nbsp;2701–2712) is a law that addresses voluntary and compelled disclosure of "stored wire and electronic communications and transactional records" held by third-party [[internet service providers]] (ISPs). It was enacted as Title II of the [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] of 1986 (ECPA).

The [[Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] protects the people's right "to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures". However, when applied to information stored online, the Fourth Amendment's protections are potentially far weaker. In part, this is because the Fourth Amendment defines the "right to be secure" in spatial terms that do not directly apply to the "reasonable expectation of privacy" in an online context. The Fourth Amendment protects "the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures."&lt;ref&gt;4. U.S. CONST. amend. IV&lt;/ref&gt; The Fourth Amendment has been stressed as a right that protects people and not places, which leaves the interpretation of the amendment's language broad in scope. In addition, society has not reached clear consensus over expectations of privacy in terms of more modern (and developing, future) forms of recorded and/or transmitted information.

Furthermore, users generally entrust the security of online information to a third party, an ISP. In many cases, Fourth Amendment doctrine has held that, in so doing, users relinquish any expectation of privacy. The [[Third-Party Doctrine]] holds "that knowingly revealing information to a third party relinquishes Fourth Amendment protection in that information."&lt;ref name=Kerr1&gt;Kerr, Orin S., "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1138128 The Case for the Third-Party Doctrine]", ''Michigan L. Rev''., Vol. 107, 2009; GWU Legal Studies Research Paper No. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; While a [[search warrant]] and [[probable cause]] are required to search one's home, under the third party doctrine only a subpoena and prior notice (a much lower hurdle than probable cause) are needed to subject an ISP to disclose the contents of an email or of files stored on a server.&lt;ref name=Kerr2&gt;Kerr, Orin S., "[http://ssrn.com/abstract=421860 A User's Guide to the Stored Communications Act, and a Legislator's Guide to Amending It]", ''George Washington L. Rev''. (2004). Available at {{DOI|10.2139/ssrn.421860}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As per request by the House Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Justice, as well as the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs asking the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) to create a report about protections surrounding electronic communications, it was found that individuals were at risk. This risk identified current protections for electronic mail as being "weak, ambiguous, or nonexistent."&lt;ref&gt;Orin S. Kerr, "A User's Guide to the Stored Communications Act, and a Legislator's Guide to Amending It," 72 ''GEO. WASH. L. REV''. 1208, 1211–12 (2004). 6 For further discussion of statutory protections afforded to private messages and wall posts, see infra Part II.B.1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The report concluded that "[t]he existing statutory framework and judicial interpretations thereof do not adequately cover new and emerging electronic surveillance technologies."&lt;ref&gt;For a defense of this doctrine, see Orin S. Kerr, "The Case for the Third-Party Doctrine," 107 ''MICH. L. REv''. 561 (2009). OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT, OTA-CIT-293, FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE AND CIVIL LIBERTIES (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Congress acknowledged the fact that traditional Fourth Amendment protections were lacking. As a result, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act was enacted in 1986 as an update on the Federal Wiretap Act of 1968, which addressed protections on telephone (land) line privacies. The provisions are distributed into 3 titles, with Title II being the Stored Communications Act.

The SCA creates Fourth Amendment-like privacy protection for email and other digital communications stored on the internet. It limits the ability of the government to compel an ISP to turn over content information and noncontent information (such as logs and "envelope" information from email). In addition, it limits the ability of commercial ISPs to reveal content information to nongovernment entities.

== Overview ==
Section 2701 [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2701%20(18%20U.S.C.%20§%202701) (18 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;2701)] of the SCA provides criminal penalties for anyone who "intentionally accesses without authorization a facility through which an electronic communication service is provided or … intentionally exceeds an authorization to access that facility; and thereby obtains, alters, or prevents authorized access to a wire or electronic communication while it is in electronic storage in such system shall be punished ... ."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2701&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2702 [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2702%20(18%20U.S.C.%20§%202702) (18 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;2702)] of the SCA targets two types of online service, "electronic communication services" and "remote computing services." The statute defines an electronic communication service as "any service which provides to users thereof the ability to send or receive wire or electronic communications." A remote computing service is defined as "the provision to the public of computer storage or processing services by means of an electronic communications system." Also describes conditions under which a public ISP can voluntarily disclose customer communications or records. In general, ISPs are forbidden to "divulge to any person or entity the contents of any communication which is carried or maintained on that service." However, ISPs are allowed to share "non-content" information, such as log data and the name and email address of the recipient, with anyone other than a governmental entity. In addition, ISPs that do not offer services to the public, such as businesses and universities, can freely disclose content and non-content information.&lt;ref name=Kerr2 /&gt; An ISP can disclose the contents of a subscriber's communications authorized by that subscriber.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sec_18_00002701----000-.html 18 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;2701(c)(2)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2703 [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703 (18 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;2703)] of the SCA describes the conditions under which the government is able to compel an ISP to disclose "customer or subscriber" content and non-content information for each of these types of service:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Electronic communication service.''' If an unopened email has been in storage for 180 days or less, the government must obtain a search warrant. There has been debate over the status of opened emails in storage for 180 days or less, which may fall in this category or the "remote computing service" category.&lt;ref name=Kerr2 /&gt;
* '''Remote computing service.''' If a communication has been in storage for more than 180 days or is held "solely for the purpose of providing storage or computer processing services" the government can use a search warrant, or, alternatively, a subpoena or a "specific and articulable facts" court order (called a 2703(d) order) combined with prior notice to compel disclosure. Prior notice can be delayed for up to 90 days if it would jeopardize an investigation. Historically, opened or downloaded email held for 180 days or less has fallen in this category, on the grounds that it is held "solely for the purpose of storage."&lt;ref name=Kerr2 /&gt;
This section also addresses the requirements for a court order for disclosure. It also addresses that no cause of action shall lie in any court against the provider under this chapter.

Section 2704 [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2704 (18 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;2704)] of the SCA describes backup preservation such that an entity operating under 2703(b)(2) may ask for a backup copy of the electronic communications in order to preserve the communications. This backup may be included in the subpoena or court order requirement requested from the ISP.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2704&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2705(b) ({{USC|18|2705(b)}}) also provides for [[gag order]]s, which direct the recipient of a 2703(d) order to refrain from disclosing the existence of the order or investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/Published/115151.p.pdf In Re: Application of the United States of America for an Order Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(d)] of January 25, 2013, p. 4, from the [[Wikileaks-related Twitter subpoenas]]&lt;/ref&gt; The court will be able to delay the notification for ninety days if it determines that there is a reason that the court order could have adverse results.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2705&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2706 [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2706 (18 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;2706)] of SCA addresses cost reimbursement such that a government entity obtaining communications and records under 2702,2703, or 2704 of the title should pay the party providing the information for incurred costs. The amount should be mutually agreed upon. This requirement is exempt when section (a) does not apply to the records held by the communications carrier.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2706&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2707 [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2707 (18 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;2707)] of SCA describes cause of civil action under this title, reliefs in a civil action, damages assessed in a civil action, administrative discipline, defence, limitation, and improper disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2707&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2708 [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2708 (18 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;2708)] of SCA states that the remedies and sanctions are the only judicial remedies and sanctions for violations of the chapter that are not constitutional violations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2708&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2709 ({{USC|18|2709}})Is in regards to counterintelligence access to telephone toll and transactional records. Subsection (a) says that a wire or electronic communication service should comply with any request for information, records, electronic communications made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation Director with required certification (b).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2709&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2710 [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2710 (18 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;2710)] of SCA describes wrongful disclosure of videotape or sale records and resulting civil action in district court in the event of a violation under this section.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2710&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2711 [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2711 (18 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;2711)] of SCA provides definitions for the chapter. The terms defined are those in section 2510 of the title, "remote computing service," "court of competent jurisdiction," and "government entity."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2711&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2712 [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2712 (18 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;2712)] of SCA discusses civil actions against the United States. Any party who has claims violation of the chapter or chapter 119 of the title may take action against U.S. District Court to recover money damages.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2712&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constitutionality of Compelled Government Disclosure ==
With respect to the government's ability to compel disclosure, the most significant distinction made by the SCA is between communications held in electronic communications services, which require a search warrant and probable cause, and those in remote computing services, which require only a subpoena or court order, with prior notice. This lower level of protection is essentially the same as would be provided by the Fourth Amendment—or potentially less, since notice can be delayed indefinitely in 90-day increments. Orin Kerr argues that, "the SCA was passed to bolster the weak Fourth Amendment privacy protections that applied to the Internet. Incorporating those weak Fourth Amendment principles into statutory law makes little sense."&lt;ref name=Kerr2 /&gt; In ''Warshak v U.S.'' (2007)&lt;ref name=Warshak2007&gt;Warshak v United States (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; this point of view found fleeting support from a panel of the Sixth Circuit, which ruled that a reasonable expectation of privacy extends to emails that would otherwise fall under the SCA's lower level of protection: "Where the third party is not expected to access the e-mails in the normal course of business, however, the party maintains a reasonable expectation of privacy, and subpoenaing the entity with mere custody over the documents is insufficient to trump the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement." Subsequently, the Sixth Circuit ''en banc'' vacated the panel's ruling and remanded for dismissal of the constitutional claim, reasoning that, because the Court had "no idea whether the government will conduct an ''ex parte'' search of Warshak's e-mail account in the future and plenty of reason to doubt that it will," the matter was not ripe for adjudication.&lt;ref name=Warshak2008&gt;''Warshak v. United States'', [http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0252p-06.pdf 532 F.3d 521] (6th Cir. 2008) (''en banc'')&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marc Zwillinger|Zwillinger]] and Sommer&lt;ref&gt;Marc Zwillinger, Jacob Sommer. "Warshak Decision: Sixth Circuit's En Banc Reversal in Warshak Sidesteps Constitutionality of Stored Communication Act's Delayed Notification Provision," [http://www.sonnenschein.com/docs/docs_icdp/PSL_080408.pdf], BNA Privacy &amp; Security Law Report, Vol. 7, No. 31, (Aug. 4, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; observed that this decision erected a barrier to "prospective" challenges by individuals with reason to believe they will be targets of surveillance. While Warshak's civil case ended without a resolution to this issue, his criminal case provided another opportunity. In ''[[United States v. Warshak]]'' (2010)&lt;ref name=Warshak2010&gt;''[http://crt.li/x/VPf United States v. Warshak]'', No. 08-3997 (6th Cir. Dec. 14, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; the Sixth Circuit found that email users have a Fourth Amendment-protected reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of their email accounts and that "to the extent that the SCA purports to permit the government to obtain such emails warrantlessly, the SCA is unconstitutional."&lt;ref name=Warshak2010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Bankston, ''[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/12/breaking-news-eff-victory-appeals-court-holds Breaking News on EFF Victory: Appeals Court Holds that Email Privacy Protected by Fourth Amendment]'', EFF DeepLinks (Dec. 14, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[In re Application of the United States for Historical Cell Site Data]]'', 724 F.3d 600 (5th Cir. 2013), the Fifth Circuit held that court orders under the Stored Communications Act compelling cell phone providers to disclose historical cell site information are not per se unconstitutional.  However, in ''[[Carpenter v. United States]]'' the Supreme Court ruled that the government violates the Fourth Amendment by accessing such information without a search warrant or exception to the warrant requirement such as exigent circumstances.

== Extraterritoriality ==
Many ISPs have server farms and data centers where their users' electronic data is stored, with locations chosen globally to bolster server performance. As a result, data could potentially be outside of U.S. Jurisdictional reach.&lt;ref&gt;MLAT: A Four-Letter Word in Need of Reform, ACCESSNOW.&lt;/ref&gt; The application of SCA to [[Extraterritoriality|extraterritorial]] jurisdiction became a point of contention, as the statute is debatably applicable to conducting searches outside of the United States, even over parties not physically in the United States. In support of this, the Bank of Nova Scotia Doctrine, or BNS, allows for "a grand jury subpoena ... used to compel a company subject to U.S. jurisdiction to produce evidence stored outside of the United States if the evidence is within the company's possession,custody, or control."&lt;ref&gt;In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Bank of Nova Scotia), 740 F.2d 817 (11th Cir. 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; With these applications come arguments for the use of an appropriate Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT).&lt;ref&gt;U.S.-Ire. MLAT, supra note 20, art. 1(2)(b).&lt;/ref&gt; It is ultimately the interpretation of the courts on which dictates how the warrant is carried out.

In light of an earlier ruling upholding extraterritorial application of the SCA in In Re Warrant of a Certain E-mail Account Controlled and Maintained by Microsoft Corporation, a new bill called the LEADS Act, was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;n re Warrant I Mag. J., supra note 5; Transcript of July 31 Order, supra note 11; In re Warrant II C.J., supra note 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill "preclude the use of U.S. warrants to obtain communications content stored outside the [United States] unless the content is in the account of an American." This means that disclosure of private communications on servers abroad through a judicial warrant can only occur if the user of such emails is a U.S. Citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Nojeim, LEADS Act Extends Important Privacy Protections, Raises Concerns, CTR. FOR DEMOCRACY &amp; TECH. (Sept. 18, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Microsoft Corporation v. United States of America'' ===
{{main|Microsoft Corp. v. United States}}

On December 4, 2013, government authorities obtained a SCA warrant from Magistrate Judge Francis in the Southern District of New York's case ''[[Microsoft Corporation v. United States of America|In re Warrant to Search a Certain E-Mail Account Controlled &amp; Maintained by Microsoft Corp]].''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;In re Warrant I Mag. J., supra note 5, at 468.&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft identified that the requested account was served on a server in Ireland. Microsoft filed a motion to quash the warrant based on the extraterritorial application of the warrant.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; This motion was denied by the court and the SCA warrant was explained as a "hybrid order", which is "executed like a subpoena in that it is served on the ISP in possession of the information and does not involve government agents entering the premises of the ISP to search its servers and seize the email account in question."&lt;ref&gt;In re Warrant I Mag. J., supra note 5, at 471.&lt;/ref&gt; The court also confirmed that a call to utilize MLAT would not be necessary in the case. The case resulted in Microsoft voluntarily being held in contempt for non-compliance with the SCA warrant. This was meant to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit as soon as they could.&lt;ref&gt;Zach Wittaker &amp; Larry Seltzer, "Microsoft Refuses to Comply After Judge Revives Overseas Data Search Warrant," ZDNET (Aug. 31, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft claimed that they would not comply unless an appellate review was conducted, at minimum.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipkin, Microsoft Admits Contempt, Sets Up Appeal On Email Warrant, LAW360 (Sept. 8, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 14, 2016 a three-judge panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] decided in favor of Microsoft that the SCA warrant cannot be seen as "hybrid order" and the SCA's warrant provisions do not apply extraterritorially.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6ea15ef5-3b7c-476b-9c80-bfed8029ebf7/4/doc/14-2985_complete_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6ea15ef5-3b7c-476b-9c80-bfed8029ebf7/4/hilite/&lt;/ref&gt; A 4-4 split decision on an [[en banc]] rehearing by the full Second Circuit left the panel's decision for the case. The U.S. Department of Justice appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], which has heard the case. A decision was expected by June 2018, but the [[CLOUD Act]] may render the question moot. The case is considered to highlight issues related to the antiquated nature of the SCA compared to modern Internet technologies.&lt;ref name="bloomberg scotus oct2017"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-16/microsoft-email-access-fight-with-u-s-gets-supreme-court-review | title = Microsoft Email-Access Fight With U.S. Gets Top Court Review | first = Greg | last = Stohr | date = October 16, 2017 | accessdate = October 16, 2017 | work = [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social Media and the SCA ==
At the time of the SCA's creation, social media platforms were not present in the context in that the legislation addressed. The SCA's limits are that of electronic communications that are not supposed to be available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;S. REP. NO. 99–541, at 35 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3589&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, court's decisions like ''Crispin v. Christian Audigier, Inc'' evidence that SCA granted protections can be allocated to certain social media communication channels. ECS and RCS identification is necessary in a decision regarding the SCA's social media application. The courts in the Crispin c. Christian Audigier, Inc. stated "messages that have not yet been opened ... operate as ECS providers and the messages are in electronic storage because they fall within the definition of "temporary, intermediate storage" under §&amp;nbsp;2510(17)(A) ... messages that have been opened and retained ... [on social networking websites] operate as RCS providers providing storage services under §&amp;nbsp;2702(a)(2).&lt;ref name="Crispin, 717 F. Supp. at 982"&gt;Crispin, 717 F. Supp. at 982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wall postings and comments are not considered protectable as forms of temporary, intermediate storage. Wall posts and comments are stored for backup protection purposes, which means they are covered under SCA subsections (B).&lt;ref name="Crispin, 717 F. Supp. at 982" /&gt; Wall posts and comments have been court-classified as electronic bulletin board service, or BBS. BBS, terminology used in the 1986 history of the SCA, defines BBS as communication networks by computer users to transfer information among computers that may be noncommercial systems being operated by users with shared interests.&lt;ref name="S. REP. NO 1986"&gt;S. REP. NO. 99-541, at 8–9 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3572– 73.&lt;/ref&gt; BBS available to the public is not covered by the SCA due to public access granted by the facilitator.&lt;ref name="S. REP. NO 1986" /&gt; However, if a user is restrictive of access to these communications on the account, then those communications are subject to SCA coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Crispin, 717 F. Supp. at 991.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unknown the level of specific BBSs privacy is sufficient for SCA protection. A numerical upper limit to the number of users, or "friends" a profile is connected to would be "arbitrary line drawing" leading to "anomalous result(s)."&lt;ref&gt;Crispin, 717 F. Supp. at 990.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] found that the SCA did not prevent the [[personal representative]]s of a deceased person from accessing his emails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook journal |first=|last=Note| title=Recent Case: Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Holds that Personal Representatives May Provide Lawful Consent for Release of a Decedent’s Emails| volume=131 | journal=[[Harvard Law Review|Harv. L. Rev.]] | page=2081 | url=https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2081-2088_Online.pdf| year=2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Crispin v. Christian Audigier, Inc.'' ==
In May 2010, a federal district court applied the SCA, for the first time, to data on social networking sites.&lt;ref name="Crispin v. Christian Audigier 2010"&gt;''Crispin v. Christian Audigier, Inc.'', 717 F. Supp. 2d 965, 971 (C.D. Cal. 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The case intended to determine if the defendants could subpoena the plaintiff's electronic communications from the social media platforms Facebook, Media Temple, and MySpace.&lt;ref name="Crispin v. Christian Audigier 2010" /&gt; Buckley Crispin, the plaintiff, filed action against Christian Audigier, Christian Audigier, Inc., and their sublicensees. Crispin claimed that the defendants used his art in violation in which the defendants served subpoenas on the three aforementioned social media platforms.&lt;ref name="Crispin v. Christian Audigier 2010" /&gt; Crispin argued that these subpoenas sought electronic communications that ISPs do not have the authority to disclose under the SCA. When the judge claimed that social media platforms are not subject to the SCA, Crispin filed a motion to reconsider in the Central District of California.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Crispin v. Christian Audigier, Inc.'', 717 F. Supp. 2d 965, 972 (C.D. Cal. 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this, determination of ECS or RCS had to be made for Facebook, Media Temple, and Myspace. The courts in this case held Facebook and MySpace to be RCS providers in regard to comments and wall posts as open messages.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Crispin v. Christian Audigier, Inc.'', 717 F. Supp. 2d 965, 982 (C.D. Cal. 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Though these communications are not temporary or intermediate storage under subjection (A), the courts found that comments and wall posts are stored for purposes of backup protection. This means that they are covered by subsection (B) of the title.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Crispin v. Christian Audigier, Inc.'', 717 F. Supp. 2d 965, 981-82 (C.D. Cal. 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Robbins v. Lower Merion School District'' ==
The Act was invoked in the 2010 ''[[Robbins v. Lower Merion School District]]'' case, where plaintiffs charged two suburban Philadelphia high schools with secretly spying on students by surreptitiously and remotely activating webcams embedded in school-issued laptops the students were using at home, violating their right to privacy. The schools admitted to secretly snapping over 66,000 webshots and screenshots, including webcam shots of students in their bedrooms.&lt;ref name="USATODAY"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/02/school-district-accused-of-issuing-webcam-laptops-to-spy-on-students/1|author=Doug Stanglin|title=School district accused of spying on kids via laptop webcams|date=February 18, 2010|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=February 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;[http://lmsd.org/documents/news/100503_l3_report.pdf "Initial LANrev System Findings"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615100827/http://lmsd.org/documents/news/100503_l3_report.pdf |date=2010-06-15 }}, LMSD Redacted Forensic Analysis, L-3 Services – prepared for [[Ballard Spahr]] (LMSD's counsel), May 2010. Retrieved August 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms of SCA ==
The language and provisions set during the 1986 year of the SCA do not comprehensively apply to modern day technology and the advancements. The SCA has led to ambiguity in compliance for ISPs as the legislation is outdated. This causes technology companies to take risks and alter their businesses to appease both domestic and international users who wish to access servers.

Courts have become unsure of the way that SCA can apply to modern service providers, being given flexibility of interpretation. The result could be little protection actually offered.&lt;ref&gt;http://law.loyno.edu/sites/law.loyno.edu/files/Sossamon-FE-printer-ready-02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Flexibility dictates that a court decision may come down to a rhetoric, like if a server is a storage site or a communications center (which could happen in the case of Gmail.) This makes it so that broad principles and interpretations are meant to keep pace with technology.

A societal criticism{{by whom|date=January 2018}} of the SCA is that the courts should be looking at the intents of parties, rather than access to communications. This brings into question the role of service providers as neutral repositories for content.&lt;ref name="Grady v. Superior Court 2006"&gt;''O'Grady v. Superior Court'', 44 Cal. Rptr. 3d 72, 88 (Cal. Ct. App. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern space, service providers are unclear on if applying SCA would be a violation of user privacy rights. As a result, non compliance to subpoena could have a legal and economic impact on service providers.&lt;ref name="Grady v. Superior Court 2006" /&gt;

The SCA is driven by case law and court interpretation. This can be criticized as an unstable grounds for an established standard. The SCA becomes less applicable as interpretations are stretched to meet new technology. Individual case law interpretations have the potential to leave undesirable political, social, and economic impacts both in the U.S. and globally.

Absence of Congressional legislative SCA reform since its 1986 enactment has been its biggest criticism due to historical and projected technological growth.

==Wednesday Night Clinic==
In 2004, the Coalition saw 740 patients, more than 600 of which came from the immediate surroundings of [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[Carrboro, North Carolina|Carrboro]], and [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]]. Of the total seen, 83% reported that they were not insured, and that the clinic was their only source of [[Primary health care|primary care]].  Since its establishment in 1968, SHAC has attempted to redress differences in health indices between minorities and [[North Carolina|North Carolina’s]] [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] population; in 2004, almost 60% of the patients seen were [[Hispanic]], and the majority of patients seen had at most a high-school-level of education.

==Education and outreach==
In addition to providing basic medical services, the Coalition performs the essential function of educating patients about healthy behaviors. The organization relies heavily on the training and resources available to its public health students for one-on-one patient counseling regarding diet, exercise, smoking cessation and sexual health. Annual educational and disease screening projects include well child clinics, ''Fiesta del Pueblo,''&lt;ref name="outreach 1"&gt;{{cite web

==HIV testing and counseling==
SHAC also provides free, no-needle, rapid HIV testing services by trained counselors. HIV/AIDS education and personalized risk reduction is provided for all clients through pre- and post-test counseling. HIV testing is available for clinic patients and walk-in clients. In 2007, it tested over 400 people. The Coalition also provides services for those that test positive. It has firm links to both UNC Infectious Disease Clinic and social services for HIV positive people.&lt;ref name="hivcounseling"&gt;{{cite web

==Pediatric healthcare==
The Coalition receives and implements grants from North Carolina's branch of ''Reach Out and Read'', which the organization uses to educate patients about child literacy and to provide pediatric patients with free reading materials. In 2004, SHAC performed clinic referrals for over a third of the patients seen, a fact which indicates the organization’s interest in connecting the patients it serves with other established medical organizations. It is also dedicated to integrating its patients into the existing primary healthcare system, and has been enrolling patients in the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] for several years.

'''''Sublimis Deus''''' (English: ''The sublime God'';&lt;ref&gt;http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Paul03/p3subli.htm&lt;/ref&gt; erroneously cited as '''''Sublimus Dei''''') is a [[papal encyclical]] promulgated by [[Pope]] [[Paul III]] on June 2, 1537, which forbids the enslavement of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] (called Indians of the West and the South) and all other people.&lt;ref&gt;Latin and English in Joel S. Panzer: The Popes and Slavery (New York: Alba House, 1996), pp. 79-81 "Sublimis Deus sic delexit humanum genus" (The exalted God loved the human race so much)&lt;/ref&gt; It goes on to state that the Indians are fully rational human beings who have rights to [[freedom]] and [[private property]], even if they are [[Pagan|heathen]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/origins-of-global-humanitarianism/proindigenist-advocacy-in-the-iberian-atlantic/E892EFB3D7B39D69C6A113A7F0A6FEEA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/A_History_of_Latin_America_to_1825.html?id=MTlK0Mx1a38C&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1103&amp;context=si_pubs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Origins_of_Global_Humanitarianism.html?id=GMS8ngEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Lost_Chronicles_of_the_Maya_Kings.html?id=_WZ6J_OAcGIC&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Encyclopedia_of_Christianity.html?id=Da65PwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/Encyclopedia_of_the_United_States_Consti.html?id=f7m713xwK58C&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt; It strengthens the recent decree issued by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] of Spain in 1530 in which the King prohibited the enslavement of Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell 1975, p.58, 68-71&lt;/ref&gt; Another related document is the ecclesiastical letter [[Pastorale Officium]], issued May 29, 1537, and usually seen as a companion document to ''Sublimis Deus''.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=yjIeYmzv3CkC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=sublimis+deus+Indians+were+fully+rational+human&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3hfdOmW_g5&amp;sig=ORl32q1pLFkM_P-M7gPNgMnCId0&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU353I9YzaAhWDK5oKHQ4iBRM4ChDoAQglMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sublimis%20deus%20Indians%20were%20fully%20rational%20human&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

There is still some controversy about how this bull is related to the documents known as ''Veritas Ipsa'', ''Unigenitus Deu''s, and ''[[Pastorale Officium]]'' (May 29, 1537). Alberto de la Hera (see footnote 1){{citation needed|date=November 2016}} believes that ''Veritas ipsa'' and ''Unigenitus Deus'' are simply other versions of ''Sublimis Deus'', and not separate bulls. Joel Panzer  (''The Popes and Slavery'' [New York: Alba House, 1996] p.&amp;nbsp;17){{citation needed|date=November 2016}} sees ''Veritas Ipsa'' as an earlier draft of ''Sublimis Deus''. While some scholars see'' Sublimis Deus'' as a primary example of Papal advocacy of Indian rights, others see it as part of an inconsistent and politically convenient stance by Paul III, who later rescinded ''Sublimis Deus'' or the ''Pastorale'' in 1538.

In ''Sublimis Deus'', Paul III unequivocally declares the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] to be rational beings with souls, denouncing any idea to the contrary as directly inspired by the "[[hostis humani generis|enemy of the human race]]" ([[Satan]]). He goes on to condemn their reduction to [[slavery]] in the strongest terms, declaring it null and void for any people known as well as any that could be discovered in the future, entitles their right to liberty and property, and concludes with a call for their evangelization.

The bull had a strong impact on the [[Valladolid debate]], and its principles eventually became the official position of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[King of Spain]], although it was often ignored by the colonists and [[conquistador]]es themselves. The executing brief for the bull ("Pastorale Officium") was annulled by Paul in 1537 at the request of the Spanish who had rescinded the decree previously issued by Charles.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell 1975, p. 68-70&lt;/ref&gt; The bull is cited at times as evidence of a strong condemnation by the church of slavery in general, but some scholars point out that Paul sanctioned slavery elsewhere after the issuing of Sublimis Deus.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell 1975, Stogre 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In late spring of 1452 Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine XI]] wrote to Pope Nicholas for help against the impending siege of Constantinople  by Ottoman Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror]]. Nicholas issued the bull ''[[Dum Diversas]]'' (18 June 1452) authorizing King [[Alfonso V of Portugal]] to "attack, conquer, and subjugate Saracens, pagans and other enemies of Christ wherever they may be found." Issued less than a year before the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, the bull may have been intended to begin another crusade against the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="sardar"&gt;Sardar, Ziauddin, and Davies, Merryl Wyn. 2004. ''The No-Nonsense Guide to Islam''. Verso. {{ISBN|1-85984-454-5}}. p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the bull ''[[Romanus Pontifex]]'' (1455) gave the right of taking for reason of punishment for crime [[saracens]] (who, as Muslims in general were slavers themselves, often capturing Christians) and [[paganism|pagans]] as perpetual slaves.

With the realization that the Americas represented regions of the Earth of which the Europeans were not aware earlier, there arose intense speculation over the question whether the natives of these lands were true humans or not. Together with that went a debate over the (mis)treatment of these natives by the Conquistadores and colonists.

A substantial party believed that these newfound peoples were not truly human. This party speculated that since Christendom was not permitted by God to become aware of their existence and thus bring the [[Gospel]] to them until so late, it was only because they were not human or possessed no souls, so they could not attain salvation. The [[New Testament]] says that the gospel has been preached to all nations;&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:23&amp;version=49 Colossians 1:23], [http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2016:25-26;&amp;version=49; Romans 16:25-26]&lt;/ref&gt; since the gospel had not been preached to the Native Americans, perhaps they did not count. In addition, Christians understood humanity to be divided into three distinct races (Europeans, Asians, and Africans), one for each of the [[sons of Noah]]. Native Americans did not fit among these divisions.

The main impetus for ''Sublimis Deus'' was a council held by prominent Missionaries in Mexico in 1537, including Archbishop [[Juan de Zumárraga]],  [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]] and Bishop of Puebla Julian Garcés. They discussed the methods of converting the natives, especially the Franciscan practice of mass baptism. Basing a recommendation to the pope on Las Casas' treatise on how to convert the Indians, "De Unico Vocationis Modo", they sent a letter to Rome with Dominican friar named Bernardino de Minaya (born ca. 1489).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Giménez Fernández, Manuel   |year=1971 |chapter=Fray Bartolomé de Las Casas: A Biographical Sketch |editor=Juan Friede and Benjamin Keen (eds.) |title=Bartolomé de las Casas in History: Toward an Understanding of the Man and his Work |series=Collection spéciale: CER|location=DeKalb |publisher=[[Northern Illinois University Press]] |pages=67–126|isbn=0-87580-025-4 |oclc=421424974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1537, Minaya arrived in Rome and pleaded his case on behalf of the Indians.

In response, Paul issued ''Sublimis Deus'' on June 2, 1537.  "Pastorale officium", a papal brief apparently used in conjunction with the ''Sublimis Deus'' by Minaya, declared automatic excommunication for anyone who failed to abide by the new ruling.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Encyclopedia Of Christianity'', p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; Stogre (1992) notes that ''Sublimis Deus'' is not present in [[Denzinger]], the authoritative compendium of official teachings of the Catholic Church, and that the executing brief for it ("Pastorale officium") was annulled the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Stogre, p. 115, fn. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Davis (1988) asserts it was annulled  due to a dispute with the Spanish crown.&lt;ref&gt;"The problem of slavery in Western culture", P. 170, fn. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of The West Indies and the Crown concluded that the documents broke their patronato rights and the Pope withdrew them, though they continued to circulate and be quoted by La Casas and others who supported Indian rights.&lt;ref&gt;Lampe, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Falkowski (2002) ''Sublimis Deus'' had the effect of revoking the bull of [[Pope Alexander VI]] ''[[Inter Caetera]]'' but still leaving the colonizers the duty of converting the native people.&lt;ref&gt;Thornberry 2002, p. 65, fn. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Prein (2008) observes the difficulty in reconciling these decrees with ''Inter Caetera''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Father Gustavo Gutierrez describes ''Sublimis Deus'' as the most important papal document relating to the condition of native Indians and that it was addressed to all Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Father Joel S Panzer, 2008. Also see Hanke, Lewis. “Pope Paul III and the American Indians.” ''Harvard Theological Review'' 30, no. 2 (April 1, 1937): 65–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell (1975) notes that the bull did not change the traditional teaching that the enslavement of Indians was permissible if they were considered "enemies of Christendom" as this would be considered by the Church as a "just war". Stogre (1992) further argues that the Indian nations had every right to self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;Stogre, p. 115-116&lt;/ref&gt; Rodney Stark (2003) describes the bull as "magnificent" and believes the reason that, in his opinion, it has belatedly come to light is due to the neglect of Protestant historians.&lt;ref&gt;Stark 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Falola asserts that the bull related to the native populations of the New World and did not condemn  the transatlantic slave trade stimulated by the Spanish monarchy and the Holy Roman Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Falola, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The wording of ''Sublimis Deus'' was a general pronouncement, framed in terms that applied not only to Indians but to all unknown peoples. The principal passage reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The enemy of the human race, who opposes all good deeds in order to bring men to destruction, beholding and envying this, invented a means never before heard of, by which he might hinder the preaching of God's word of Salvation to the people: he inspired his satellites who, to please him, have not hesitated to publish abroad that the Indians of the West and the South, and other people of whom We have recent knowledge should be treated as dumb brutes created for our service, pretending that they are incapable of receiving the Catholic Faith.

We, who, though unworthy, exercise on earth the power of our Lord and seek with all our might to bring those sheep of His flock who are outside into the fold committed to our charge, consider, however, that the Indians are truly men and that they are not only capable of understanding the Catholic Faith but, according to our information, they desire exceedingly to receive it. Desiring to provide ample remedy for these evils, We define and declare by these Our letters, or by any translation thereof signed by any notary public and sealed with the seal of any ecclesiastical dignitary, to which the same credit shall be given as to the originals, that, notwithstanding whatever may have been or may be said to the contrary, the said Indians and all other people who may later be discovered by Christians, are by no means to be deprived of their liberty or the possession of their property, even though they be outside the faith of Jesus Christ; and that they may and should, freely and legitimately, enjoy their liberty and the possession of their property; nor should they be in any way enslaved; should the contrary happen, it shall be null and have no effect.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Tokkeitai'''|特警隊||short for {{Nihongo2|特別警察隊}} ''Tokubetsu Keisatsutai'', "Special Police Corps", or Naval [[Secret police|Secret Police]]}} was the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s [[military police]], equivalent to the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s ''[[Kempeitai]]''. It was also the smallest military police service.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

The original ''Tokkeitai'' was known as the [[General Affairs Section]] and concerned itself with police and [[personnel]] work within the Navy: personnel, discipline and records. It took a more active role, partly to keep the ''Kempeitai'' and the Army from meddling in Navy affairs. Smaller and more low-key than its rival, it was no less brutal.

It was especially active in the areas of the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] and the [[Naval Control Area]] and was as pervasive as the ''Kempeitai''. It had the same [[commissar]] roles in relation to exterior enemies or suspicious persons, and it watched inside units for possible defectors or traitors under the security doctrine of ''[[Kikosaku]]''.

Attached to navy units, they served as [[Colonial police]] in some occupied [[Pacific]] areas. Later accusations of [[war crimes]] were made against them in that role for such acts as coercion of women from Indonesia, Indochina and China into [[comfort women|sexual slavery]].
{{Wikisource|Enforced prostitution in Western Borneo during Japanese Occupation}}

In addition to its police responsibilities, it was the operative branch of the Secret Service Branch of the Imperial Japanese Navy ({{nihongo|Information Office|情報局|[[Jōhō-kyoku]]}}, which was responsible for recovering and analyzing information and for the execution of undercover operations. Its members also provided local security near [[naval base]]s. In the final weeks of the [[Pacific War]], it was among the security units prepared for combat against the proposed [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Operation Downfall|invasion of Japan]].

The '''Union Saint-Jean-Baptiste d'Amérique (USJB)''', also referred to by its member organizations as the '''Société de Saint-Jean-Baptiste d'Amérique''' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} '''"Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society of America"'''), was a [[Franco-American]] [[benefit society]] first organized in 1899 when the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society of [[Holyoke]] invited several other so-named independent organizations to form a national committee. Its first meeting was held on February 26, 1899; in the following year its first national congress was held on March 27, 1900, and the national organization was officially incorporated on May 7, 1900 in [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Worcester Magazine|title=L'Union St. Jean Baptiste d'Amerique|pages=184–185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XHcWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA184|publisher=Worcester Chamber of Commerce; Belisle Printing &amp; Publishing|year=1915|volume=XVIII}}&lt;/ref&gt; While L'Union was primarily formed for the purpose of creating sick, disability, and death funds for American French-speaking [[Roman Catholic|Catholics]], the organization would also provide scholarships, civic education, and held cultural events including celebrations on [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day]], parades, culinary and musical events, including [[French opera]] performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|page=5|title=Nearly 5000 in Line in Colorful Holyoke Parade|date=October 13, 1925|work=Springfield Republican|location=Springfield, Mass}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a period of decline, the organization's [[mutual organization|mutual]] functions were merged with Catholic Financial Life in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sjbef.org/?page_id=15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423025048/https://www.sjbef.org/?page_id=15|archive-date=April 23, 2017|title=About Us|website=Saint-Jean-Baptiste Educational Foundation|accessdate=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The beginnings of the Franco-American colony in Woonsocket, Rhode Island|publisher=Assumption College Insitut Français|year=1997|page=552|author1=Marie Louise Bonier|author2=Raymond H.

'''White separatism''' is a [[Separatism|separatist]] political and social movement that seeks the separation of [[white people]] from people of other [[race (human categorization)|races]] and [[ethnicity|ethnicities]], the establishment of a [[white ethnostate]] by removing non-whites from existing communities or by forming new communities elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_200607/ai_n16855771/pg_9/ |title=The Strategy of White Separatism |journal=Journal of Political and Military Sociology |date=Summer 2006 |last1=Dobratz |first1=Betty A. |last2=Shanks-Meile |first2=Stephanie L. |lastauthoramp=yes|volume=34 |number=1 |pages=49–80 }}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A study of the white separatist movement in the United States reported that adherents usually reject [[Interracial marriage|marriage "outside the white race"]]. The authors also noted "a distinction between the [[White supremacy|supremacist]] desire to dominate (as in [[apartheid]], [[slavery]], or [[Racial segregation|segregation]]) and complete separation by race".&lt;ref&gt;Dobratz, Betty A. &amp; Shanks-Meile, Stephanie L. (2000) ''The White Separatist Movement in the United States: "White Power, White Pride!''. Baltimore: JHU Press. pp.vii, 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary scholars disagree over whether white separatism is distinct from white supremacist beliefs: the [[Anti-Defamation League]] argues that white supremacists use the phrase because they believe it has fewer negative connotations than the term ''white supremacist''. &lt;ref name="ADL_def"&gt;{{cite web |title=ADL: White Separatism |url=https://www.adl.org/resources/glossary-terms/white-separatism |website=adl.org |publisher=The Anti-Defamation League |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have argued that, while many white separatists are also white supremacists, contemporary white separatists reject the view that returning to a system of segregation is possible or desirable in the United States. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Dobratz |first1=Betty A. |last2=Shanks-Meile |first2=Stephanie L. |lastauthoramp=yes|year=1997 |title=The White Separatist Movement in the United States: White Power, White Pride! |location=New York |publisher=Twayne Publishers |isbn=9780805738650 |oclc=37341476 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r59bGyH4lOAC|pages=ix,12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
