'''''al-ʿIqd al-Farīd''''' ('''''The Unique Necklace''''', {{lang-ar|العقد الفريد}}) is an anthology attempting to encompass 'all that a well-informed person had to know in order to pass in society as a cultured and refined individual' (or ''[[Adab (literature)|adab]]''),&lt;ref&gt;Issa J. Boullata, 'Translator's Introduction', in Ibn ʿAbd Rabbih, ''The Unique Necklace: Al-ʿIqd al-Farīd'', trans. by Issa J. Boullata, Great Books of Islamic Civilization, 3 vols (Reading: Garnet, 2007-2011), p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; composed by [[Ibn ʿAbd Rabbih]] (860–940), a Moorish writer and poet associated with [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordova]], now in [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Alvarez. (1998). Ibn `Abd Rabbih. In ''Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature'' (Vol. 1, pp. 302-303). Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

The anthology is divided into 25 sections. The 13th section is named the middle jewel of the necklace, and the chapters on either side are named after other jewels. It is an [[Adab (literature)|adab]] book resembling [[Ibn Qutaybah]]'s ''`Uyun al-akhbar'' (The Fountains of Story) and the writings of [[al-Jahiz]] from which it borrows largely.&lt;ref&gt;L. Alvarez, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Montgomery Watt, Pierre Cachia. (1996)''A History of Islamic Spain''. p. 73. Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he spent all his life in al-Andalus and did not travel to the East like some other Andalusian scholars, most of his book's material is drawn from the East Islamic world. Also, Ibn Abd Rabbih quoted no Andalusian compositions other than his own. He included in his book his 445-line ''Urjuza'', a poem in the meter of the ''[[rajaz]]'' in which he narrates the warlike exploits of [[Abd al-Rahman al-Nasir]], along with some of his eulogies of the Umayyads of al-Andalus.&lt;ref&gt;Boullata ,2007&lt;/ref&gt; A major study of its sources was undertaken by Werkmeister.&lt;ref&gt;Werkmeister, W. (1983), Quellenuntersuchungen zum Kitāb al-’Iqd al-farīd des Andalusiers Ibn ʻAbdrabbih (246/860–328/940), Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

The Būyid vizier [[Sahib ibn Abbad]] 'is commonly quoted to illustrate the alleged lackluster reception the book met in the Orient': he is alleged to have said '“this is our merchandise brought back to us.” I thought this book contained some information about their country [Andalusia]. But it rather contains information about ours. We have no need for it' (alluding to Koran [[Yusuf (sura)|12]]:65).&lt;ref&gt;Issa J. Boullata, 'Translator's Introduction', in Ibn ʿAbd Rabbih, ''The Unique Necklace: Al-ʿIqd al-Farīd'', trans. by Issa J. Boullata, Great Books of Islamic Civilization, 3 vols (Reading: Garnet, 2007-2011), I xiv; Isabel Toral-Niehoff, 'The “Book of the Pearl on the Ruler” in ''The Unique Necklace'' by Ibn ʻAbd Rabbih: Preliminary Remarks', https://www.academia.edu/7399721, pp. 134-51 (p. 139).&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was widely copied—about 100 manuscripts are known—and was frequently excerpted. It was also among the earliest ''adab'' works to be printed and has been printed at least ten times since in different editions.&lt;ref&gt;Isabel Toral-Niehoff, 'The “Book of the Pearl on the Ruler” in ''The Unique Necklace'' by Ibn ʻAbd Rabbih: Preliminary Remarks', https://www.academia.edu/7399721, pp. 134-51 (p. 140).&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was not, however, translated until scholarly European translations of portions began in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Issa J.

[[File:Ama.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|An ''ama'']]
{{Nihongo|'''''Ama'''''|海人||women {{nihongo2|海女}}; men {{nihongo2|海士}};}}, '''''uminchu''''' (in [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]]) or  '''''kaito''''' (in the [[Izu Peninsula]]) are [[Japan]]ese [[Underwater diving|divers]], famous for collecting [[pearl]]s.  The majority of ''ama'' are women.

''Ama'' means "sea woman".

== History ==
Japanese tradition holds that the practice of ''ama'' may be 2,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rahn |first=H. |author2=Yokoyama, T. |title=Physiology of Breath-Hold Diving and the Ama of Japan. |year=1965 |publisher=National Academy of Sciences - National Research Council |location=United States |isbn=0-309-01341-0 |page=369 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3279 |accessdate=2008-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, and even as recently as the 1960s, ''ama'' dived wearing only a loincloth. Even in modern times, ''ama'' dive without [[Scuba set|scuba gear]] or [[Diving cylinder|air tanks]], making them a traditional sort of [[free-diver]].

Records of the female pearl divers, or ama, date back as early as 927 AD in Japan's [[Heian period]]. Early ama were known to dive for seafood and were honored with the task of retrieving abalone for shrines and imperial emperors. Ama traditionally wear white as it was believed to ward off sharks. Early divers wore only a loin cloth but in the 20th century the divers adopted an all-white sheer diving uniform in order to be more presentable while diving.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Legends of the Deep: Japan|last=Wallace|first=Sue|date=July 2010|work=Sun Herald|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl diving ama were considered rare in the early years of diving, however, [[Mikimoto Kōkichi|Mikimoto Kokichi]]’s discovery and production of the cultured pearl in 1893 produced a great demand for ama. Nowadays, the pearl diving ama are viewed as a tourist attraction at Mikimoto Pearl island.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Ancient art of pearl diving breathes its last: Japanese women who mine seabed one lungful of air at a time are last of their kind|last=McCurry|first=Justin|date=August 2006|work=The Guardian|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of ama continue to dwindle as this ancient technique becomes less and less practiced due to disinterest in the new generation of women and the dwindling demand for the diving women. In the 1940s 6000 ama were reported active along the coasts of Japan while today ama practice at numbers more along the scale of 60 or 70 divers in a generation.

== Activities ==
Women began diving as ama as early as 12 and 13 years old, taught by elder ama. Despite their early start, divers are known to be active well into their 70s and are rumored to live longer due to their diving training and disciplines. In Japan, women were considered to be superior divers due to the distribution of their fat and their ability to hold their breath.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As described above, the garment of the ama have changed throughout time from the original loincloth to white sheer garb and eventually to the modern diving wetsuit. The world of the ama is one marked by duty and superstition. One traditional article of clothing that has stood the test of time is their headscarves. The headscarves are adorned with symbols such as the ''seiman'' and the ''douman'' which have the function of bringing luck to the diver and warding off evil. The ama are also known to create small shrines near their diving location where they will visit after diving in order to thank the gods for their safe return.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The ama were expected to endure harsh conditions while diving such as freezing temperatures and great pressures from the depths of the sea. Through the practice, many ama were noted to lose weight during the months of diving seasons. Ama practiced a breathing technique in which the divers would release air in a long whistle once they resurfaced from a dive. This whistling became a defining characteristic of the ama as this technique is unique to them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== In culture ==

* The [[NHK]] [[Asadora|morning television drama]] ''[[Amachan]]'' is about the ama.
* ''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife]]'', an 1814 woodblock print by Japanese artist [[Hokusai]], depicts a young ama diver entwined sexually with a pair of [[octopus]]es.

She is well remembered for her character roles in ''Samsaram Oka Chadarangam'', ''Muthyamantha Muddu'', ''Swargam Narakam'', ''Assembly Rowdy'' and acted in almost all of the 1980s movies with [[Chiranjeevi]] as lead hero namely ''Donga'', ''Chattamtho Porattam'', ''Sangarshana'', ''Raakshashudu'', ''Trinetrudu'', ''Marana Mrudangam'','' Khaidi No 786'', and ''Jwala''.

She also acted in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] movies such as ''Nadodi Pattukkaran'', and ''Varavu Nalla Uravu'' etc. and in [[Hindi]] movies such as ''Waqt Ka Shahenshah'', and ''Kanoon Ki Hathkadee''. With couple of years gap, she started her second innings in 2007 with Telugu movies ''Evadithe Nakenti'' and ''Godava'' as mother and grand mother respectively.

Annapoorna who played the role of heroine to [[Mohan Babu]] in ''[[Swargam Narakam]]'' movie also played the role of mother to [[Mohan Babu]] in ''[[Assembly Rowdy]]'' movie released in 1991. Both the movies were blockblusters in the history of Telugu film industry. Now (2016) she is playing  grandmother for Heroine in Nikhils latest film Ekkada ki pothavu chinnavaada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.totaltollywood.com/profiles/profiles.php?category=1&amp;id=mohanbabu ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922104302/http://www.totaltollywood.com/profiles/profiles.php?category=1&amp;id=mohanbabu |date=22 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Automatic and controlled processes''' ('''ACP''') are the two categories of cognitive processing. All cognitive processes fall into one or both of those two categories. The amounts of "processing power", [[attention]], and effort a process requires is the primary factor used to determine whether it's a controlled or an automatic process. An automatic process is capable of occurring without the need for attention, and the awareness of the initiation or operation of the process, and without drawing upon general processing resources or interfering with other concurrent thought processes.&lt;ref name="Bargh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bargh|first=John|title=Unintended Thought|year=1989|publisher=Guilford Publications|author2=James S. Uleman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Put simply, an automatic process is unintentional, involuntary, effortless (not consumptive of limited processing capacity), and occurring outside awareness. Controlled processes are defined as a process that is under the flexible, intentional control of the individual, that he or she is consciously aware of, and that are effortful and constrained by the amount of attentional resources available at the moment.&lt;ref name=Bargh /&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Automatic processes===
When examining the label "automatic" in social psychology, we find that some processes are intended, and others require recent conscious and intentional processing of related information. That being said automatic effects fall into three classes: Those that occur prior to conscious awareness (preconscious); those that require some form of conscious processing but that produce an unintended outcome (postconscious); and those that require a specific type of intentional, goal directed processing (goal-dependent).

Preconscious automaticity requires only the triggering [[proximal]] stimulus event, and occur prior to or in the absence of any conscious awareness of that event.&lt;ref name=Bargh /&gt; Because they occur without our conscious awareness they are unnoticeable, uncontrollable, and nearly effortless. Many previous studies suggest that the mere perception of the physical behaviors of others, as well as abstract categories (race, gender, role-related) that occurs passively in person perception results in increased tendencies to behave in the same way oneself.&lt;ref name=Yale&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bargh|first=John|author2=Kay L. Schwader |author3=Sarah E. Hailey |author4=Rebecca L. Dyer |author5=Erica J. Boothby |title=Automaticity in social-cognitive processes|year=2012|location=Yale University, Department of Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt; So basically a stimulus may that be person, object, or an action will unconsciously affect one's response and or behavior without one's knowledge. In a study they subliminally exposed one of the participants with an African American face or a Caucasian face before the participants engaged in a verbal game.&lt;ref name="Chen + Bargh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Mark|author2=John Bargh|title=Nonconscious Behavioral Confirmation Processes: The Self-Fulfilling Consequences of Automatic Stereotype Activation|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=2 January 1997|doi=10.1006/jesp.1997.1329|volume=33|pages=541–560}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that when participants were subliminally exposed to the African American faces they were significantly more aggressive in the verbal game than those exposed to the Caucasian face.&lt;ref name="Chen + Bargh" /&gt; In a study related to this the participants were required to play a video game that depicted a real-life situation that involved deciding to shoot a man with a gun. Participants were shown pictures of both Caucasian and African American men with or without a gun or another object in hand. The participants had to respond "Shoot" or "Not Shoot" within milliseconds. The results were that participants significantly decided to shoot faster when African Americans had a gun versus Caucasians.&lt;ref name=Correll&gt;{{cite journal|last=Correll|first=Joshua|author2=Charles M. Judd |author3=Bernd Wittenbrink |title=The Police Officer's Dilemma: Using Ethnicity to Disambiguate Potentially Threatening Individuals|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2002|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.6.1314|volume=83|pages=1314–1329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postconscious automaticity depends on recent conscious experience for its occurrence.&lt;ref name=Bargh /&gt; This postconscious influence on processing can be defined as the non-conscious consequences of conscious thought.&lt;ref name=Bargh /&gt; The conscious experience may be intentional, or it may be unintentional, what is important is that the material be in awareness.&lt;ref name=Bargh /&gt; Most things we are aware of are driven by the environment, and one does not intend or control the flood of these [[perceptual]] experiences, yet they still result in postconscious effects. In other words, we need to consciously engage in something and depending on the experience we will unconsciously think, and or behave a certain way. In the classic [[Bobo doll experiment]] a child watches a video of an adult acting aggressive towards a Bobo doll. Later when the child is put in the room with that same doll, the child was more likely to also engage in that act, versus children who didn't watch the video. In a study participants were [[priming (psychology)|primed]] with the stereotype of professors by being told to imagine a typical professor for 5&amp;nbsp;min and to list (a conscious act) the behaviors, lifestyle, and appearance attributes of this typical professor.&lt;ref name=DJJ&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dijksterhuis|first=AP|author2=Ad van Knippenberg|title=The Relation Between Perception and Behavior, or How to Win a Game of Trivial Pursuit|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1998|location=University of Nijmegen|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.4.865|volume=74|pages=865–877|pmid=9569649}}&lt;/ref&gt; After they were primed they had to perform a general knowledge task. The results were that the participants in the professor condition outperformed those in the control conditions (those not primed at all).&lt;ref name=DJJ /&gt;

Goal-dependent automaticity concerns skill and thought processes that require a goal to engage in them. This process is much similar to postconscious in that it requires conscious awareness to be initiated, but after that it can be guided outside of awareness by the [[unconscious mind]]. A good example would be driving a car: in order to drive a car, one needs to consciously have a goal to drive somewhere. When engaged in driving (only with enough practice) one can almost operate the car almost entirely without conscious awareness.&lt;ref name=Yale /&gt; However, more attentional control and decision making are needed when introduced to novel (reference) situations like driving through an unfamiliar town. The process needs to be learned enough that it can be automatic, requiring little conscious thought as to how to do it.

===Controlled processes===
One definition of a controlled process is an intentionally-initiated sequence of cognitive activities.&lt;ref name=Scneider&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Shiffrin|title=Controlled Automatic Human Information Processing|year=1977|issue=I. Detection, Search, and Attention.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, when attention is required for a task, we are consciously aware and in control. Controlled processes require us to think about situations, evaluate and make decisions. An example would be reading this article. We are required to read and understand the concepts of these processes and it takes effort to think conceptually. Controlled processes are thought to be slower, since by definition they require effortful control; therefore, they generally cannot be conducted simultaneously with other controlled processes without task-switching or impaired performance. So the drawback of controlled processes is that humans are thought to have a [[Cognitive load|limited capacity]] for overtly controlling behavior. Being tightly capacity-limited, controlled processing imposes considerable limitations on speed and the ability to [[Human multitasking|multitask]]. In a study, participants were randomly assigned into two conditions, one requiring one task (small cognitive load) and one requiring two tasks (heavy cognitive load). In the one-task condition, participants were told that they would hear an anti- or pro-abortion speech and would have to diagnose the speaker's attitude toward abortion. The two-task condition had the same first assignment, but they were required to switch spots with the speaker and take their place after that. Even after being specifically told that they would be given further instructions at the next step, their cognitive load was affected in this study. Participants in the two-task condition performed more poorly than the one-task condition simply because they had the next task on their mind (they had extra cognitive load). Basically, the more tasks someone tries to manage at the same time, the more their performance will suffer.

===Processes with ambiguous categorization===
Some cognitive processes are difficult to categorize as distinctly automatic or controlled, either because they contain components of both types of process or because the phenomena are difficult to define or observe. An example of the former is driving a car. An example of the latter is [[Flow (psychology)|flow]].

===Flow===
{{main|Flow (psychology)}}
Flow has been described as involving highly focused attention on the task at hand, loss of self-consciousness, and distorted time [[perception]], among other cognitive characteristics. Some people report that during flow states they are less aware of [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] responses such as hunger, fatigue, and discomfort. Some researchers hypothesize that because of this, some challenging tasks can counterintuitively require less effort to perform.&lt;ref name="Moller"/&gt;

Flow has been difficult to study, however, because it is difficult to produce in a controlled laboratory setting. Most experiments have relied heavily on correlating the presence of flow with various attributes of the task and the subjects' reported experiences. Of those correlations, subjects experiencing flow generally report that they perceive a good match between the task requirements and their skills (e.g. a professional basketball player in a professional basketball game.) Task structure and the clarity of the goal of the task are also thought to be related to when flow occurs.&lt;ref name="Moller"/&gt; All of these aspects of flow imply that there must be an opportunity to suppress other controlled processes, as well as inhibit certain types of automatic processes.

A study involving [[video game]] performance showed that flow in participants (determined based on a self-report survey of flow characteristics) strongly correlated with performance in the game. A related study attempted to inhibit and induce flow by biasing the moods of participants. The experimenters found that flow could be inhibited by a negative mood, but could not be induced by a positive mood.&lt;ref name="Moller"/&gt;

"A person does not need to be told to pay attention to a stimulus that captures attention quickly and effortlessly.&lt;ref name=Scneider /&gt; In many cases, explicitly directing one's own or another's attention is necessary due to the presence of another stimulus that more easily captures attention. In the case of flow, however, an action that would normally grab one's attention is ignored, and many automatic processes are either suppressed (such as stimulus-driven attention changes) or ignored (such as discomfort.)

On the other hand, situations in which autonomy is encroached upon (for example, if the individual must always control his/her actions to abide by rules imposed by the task) are thought to inhibit flow.&lt;ref name="Moller"&gt;Moller, A. C., Meier, B. P., &amp; Wall, R. D. 2010. Developing an experimental induction of flow: Effortless action in the lab. In B. Bruya (Ed.), Effortless attention: A new perspective in the cognitive science of attention and action (pp. 191–204). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that another requirement of flow is to be free from constraints that force controlled processes to be used. Additionally, several areas of research indicate that during a state of flow an otherwise-controlled process becomes automatic allowing it to behave dominant over all other automatic processes.

'''Babuzai''' (also spelled: Babozai)([[Pashto Language|Pashto]]: بابوزي) is a [[Pashtun tribes|Pashtun tribe]].
[[File:Babuzai Family Tree.tif|thumb|The image describes Family lineage of Pashtun Tribe Babuzai.]]

== History ==
Babuzai is named after '''Babu''' (Often called: '''Baizai'''). There is a tradition among [[Pashtuns]] that they name the tribe after the name of that person from whom the clan or tribe has been initiated, the descendant are named after their first ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ag-afghanistan.de/files/glatzer/tribal_system.pdf |title=The Pashtun Tribal System |last1=Glatzer |first1=Bernt |date=2002 |publisher=Concept Publishers |location=New Delhi |accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, Babu is the name of a person, his descendant until now are called Babuzai.

'''Casebook PBC''' is a US [[cloud computing]] [[public-benefit corporation]] headquartered in [[New York City]]. Incubated by the [[Annie E. Casey Foundation]], the company initially developed child welfare solutions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aecf.org/blog/new-casey-web-tool-has-potential-to-transform-case-management |title=New Casey Web Tool May Transform Case Management in Child Welfare |last=|first=|date= |year=2011 |publisher= Annie E. Casey Foundation |accessdate= 23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since expanded to provide a SaaS platform servicing the whole of [[Human Services]].

== History ==
Casebook initially started as a project of the Annie E. Casey Foundation under the leadership of Kathleen Feely, who was Vice-President for Innovation at the foundation. After early success with private service providers, the software was spun out into its own non-profit organization, known as Case Commons.

In 2012, Indiana's Department of Child Services was the first state agency to implement Casebook as a mobile and web-based solution for its child welfare caseworkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethsimonenoveck/2014/04/21/the-technology-we-need-to-protect-children-21st-century-citizen-services/#565bbf354a9d |title= The Technology We Need to Protect Children: 21st Century Citizen Services |last=|first= |date=21 April 2014|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gcn.com/articles/2015/07/07/indiana-tech-success.aspx|title=Indiana: A showcase for the integration of visualization, mobility and analytics|last=|first=|date=7 July 2015|publisher=GCN|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effort led to the organization receiving the Design for Experience Award in 2014 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uxmag.com/articles/announcing-winners-in-the-2014-design-for-experience-awards|title=Announcing Winners in the 2014 Design for Experience Awards |last=|first= |date= |year=2014 |publisher= UX Magazine |accessdate= 23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Code for America Technology Award in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://awards.codeforamerica.org/2015/winner/Casebook/

In 2017, the organization helped the state of California's Child Welfare Digital Services agency learn how to build and ship software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://cwds.ca.gov/posts/how-we-put-users-at-the-heart-of-our-work|title=How we put users at the heart of our work |last=|first= |date= |year=2017 |publisher=California Child Welfare Digital Services Agency |accessdate= 23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, under the leadership of a new CEO, [[Tristan Louis]], Casebook PBC entered into a national partnership with [[KPMG]], allowing KPMG to leverage the Casebook platform as its exclusive solution for the child welfare vertical&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://home.kpmg.com/us/en/home/media/press-releases/2017/10/kpmg-case-commons-announce-alliance-to-aid-agencies-upgrading-child-welfare-and-juvenile-justice-systems.html |title= KPMG, Case Commons Announce Alliance to Aid Agencies Upgrading Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice Systems|date= October 23, 2017 |website= KPMG.com |accessdate= 6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rebranded from Case Commons to Casebook PBC.

== Products ==
The company offers the Casebook Platform, a set of core components that can be used for a variety of Human Services software developments. Because of its historical background in the Child Welfare space, the company also offers a suite of applications that, when put together, can allow states to assemble a CCWIS-ready child welfare system.

'''Crime in spain
''' is combated by [[Law enforcement in Spain|Spain's law enforcement agencies]].

== Crime by type ==
===Murder===
{{See|List of countries by intentional homicide rate}}

In 2012, Spain had a murder rate of 0.8 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; There were a total of 364 murders in Spain in 2012.&lt;ref name=UNODC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/index.html|title=UNODC: Global Study on Homicide|first=|last=agt|website=www.unodc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drug-related crime ===
Spain is the principal route of entry of drugs and narcotics into the European Union. Indeed, about half of the cocaine found by law enforcement agencies in Europe is found by Spanish police.&lt;ref name="tremlett2005"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/sep/07/spain.drugstrade|title=Spain tops table of cocaine use|last=Tremlett|first=Giles|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=15 August 2011|location=London|date=7 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain has a high number of drug users, leading the table of cocaine users in Europe.&lt;ref name="tremlett2005"/&gt;

==== Cocaine importation ====
Cocaine usage in Spain is high by world standards.&lt;ref name="Tremlett"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/sep/07/spain.drugstrade | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Giles | last=Tremlett | title=Spain tops table of cocaine use | date=7 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain is a major transit point for cocaine entering Europe.&lt;ref name="Tremlett"/&gt; After arrival in Spain, much of the cocaine is then trafficked to other countries.&lt;ref name="Tremlett"/&gt; In 2005, over 50% of the cocaine found by police in Europe was found by Spanish police.&lt;ref name="Tremlett"/&gt; The so-called [[Galician mafia]] is the main trafficker of cocaine into [[Spain]] and to European countries such as the [[United Kingdom]].

=== Background level of crime against tourists ===
The [[US Department of State]]'s [[Bureau of Consular Affairs]] advised travellers in 2011 that Spain had a "moderate rate of crime".&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1024.html|title=Spain and Andorra Country Specific Information |website=travel.state.gov |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130214020345/https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1024.html |archive-date=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Street crimes against tourists occur in the principal tourist areas.&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov"/&gt; Madrid and Barcelona, in particular, report incidents of "pick-pocketing, mugging, and occasional violent attacks".&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov"/&gt;
In Madrid, incidents have been reported in "all major tourist areas, including the area near the Prado Museum, near Atocha train station, in Retiro Park, in areas of old Madrid including near the Royal Palace, and in Plaza Mayor".&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov"/&gt; In Barcelona, the largest number of incidents reported also occurred in major tourist areas.&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov"/&gt;

== Crime statistics ==
Crime statistics for Spain are published annually by the [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística (Spain)|Instituto Nacional de Estadística]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.es/inebmenu/mnu_justicia.htm|title=Datos de Seguridad y Justicia|website=Instituto Nacional de Estadística|language=Spanish|accessdate=15 August 2011|location=Madrid}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different agencies of Spain and the [[European Union]] conduct analysis of the crime data in Spain. Statistics show Spain is one of the European countries with the lowest crime rate, according to a 2005 Gallop Europe research study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hampshire|first=David|title=Living and Working in Spain: Survival Handbook|edition=Third|series=Survival Handbooks|year=2000|publisher=Survival Books|isbn=978-1-901130-41-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup-europe.be/euics/Xz38/downloads/EUICS%20-%20The%20Burden%20of%20Crime%20in%20the%20EU.pdf|title=The Burden of Crime in the EU|first1=Jan |last1=van Dijk |first2=Robert |last2=Manchin |first3=John |last3=van Kesteren |first4=Sami |last4=Nevala |first5=Gergely |last5=Hideg|publisher=Galluo Europe|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/199011/0/delincuencia/europa/gallup/|title=Un informe europeo clasifica a España como el país de Europa con menos delincuencia común|last=Gómez|first=Ignacio|publisher=Diario 20 Minutos|language=Spanish|accessdate=15 August 2011|location=Madrid|date=2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Europeworld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeword.com/blog/europe/european-crime-rates/|title=European Crime Rates|last=Europeworld|publisher=Europe World|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1541699/Britain-tops-European-crime-league.html|title=Britain tops European crime league|last=Johnston|first=Philip|date=6 February 2007|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=23 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of [[contravention|misdemeanour]]s and [[crime]]s in Spain was 46 per 1,000 people in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/delincuencia/2009/fue/baja/decada/Interior/elpepuesp/20100309elpepunac_11/Tes|title=La delincuencia en 2009 fue la más baja de la década, según Interior|journal=El País|author=J.

==Population==
The estimated population of {{UN_Population|Year}} is {{UN_Population|Anguilla}} ({{UN_Population|source}}).
[[Image:Anguilla population pyramid 2006.png|thumb|425px|[[Population pyramid]] of Anguilla.]]

72% of the population is Anguillian while 28% is non-Anguillian (2001 census). Of the non-Anguillian population, many are citizens of the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[St Kitts &amp; Nevis]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Nigeria]].

2006 and 2007 saw an influx of large numbers of [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Indian people|Indian]], and [[Mexican people|Mexican]] workers, brought in as labor for major tourist developments due to the local population not being large enough to support the labor requirements.

[[File:Thursfield Street, Salford.jpg|thumb|rught|Boarded-up housing in [[City of Salford|Salford]].]]

'''Empty dwelling management orders''' ('''EDMOs''') are a legal device used in [[England and Wales]], which enable [[local authority|local authorities]] to put an unoccupied property back into use as [[House|housing]]. EDMOs were created by the [[Housing Act 2004]], with the relevant legislation coming into effect in mid-2006;&lt;ref&gt;Sections 132 through 138; see also Schedule 7 of the Act.&lt;/ref&gt; in the three and a half years to the end of 2010, however, only 43 had been issued.

==Background==

A significant number of residential properties in Britain are empty at any one time; whilst a large proportion of these are empty on a temporary basis, for example during refurbishment or during changes in ownership, many remain unoccupied for long stretches of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More than 11,000 UK homes empty for 10 years|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42536418|accessdate=1 January 2018|agency=BBC News|date=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These properties pose a problem in two ways; they tend to decrease the quality of life in their area, by becoming magnets for vandalism and the like, and they indirectly contribute to the problem of [[homelessness]] by limiting the pool of available housing.

Local authorities have traditionally had a number of powers to force abandoned buildings back into use, most notably the power of [[compulsory purchase in England and Wales|compulsory purchase]] and [[enforced sale]]. In the first of these cases, the property is purchased by the council; in the second, the owner is compelled to offer it for sale in the open market. However, both of these required a forcible change of ownership, and especially with an enforced sale, there was no guarantee that the building would actually be put back into use.

In 2001, the [[Empty Homes Agency]] suggested that rather than force the properties to be sold, the local authorities could instead force them to be rented out to tenants, a "compulsory leasing" process. A parliamentary select committee adopted the idea, but government support for legislation was limited. In 2003, as the government drafted plans for housing reform, it issued consultation papers on a proposed form of "empty homes management orders", but they were not made part of the final [[Housing Act 2004|Housing Bill]]. They were added to the bill, now titled as "empty dwelling management orders", in an amendment by [[David Kidney]] MP, with broad cross-party support.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Story So Far...", ''Guide to Empty Dwelling Management Orders''&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst they had broad parliamentary support, the EDMOs were strongly criticised in some sections of the media, with the ''[[Daily Express]]'' reporting that the government wanted to seize 250,000 homes, and a columnist in the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' declaring that Britain had become a "communist country".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The legislation first came into force in 2006, but no orders were issued that year. As of June 2009, 24 interim EDMOs had been approved, "nearly half" of which had been approved in the preceding twelve months;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2009-06-24a.290.3 House of Lords written answer by Lord McKenzie of Luton], 24 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; by the end of 2010, a total of 43 had been approved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2011-02-01a.36676.h House of Commons written answer by Andrew Stunell], 1 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers==
A local authority wishing to use an EDMO must apply to a [[residential property tribunal]] for approval of an interim order, the first stage in the process. The tribunal must be satisfied that the property has been empty for at least two years, as well as being heavily vandalised or actively used for "antisocial" purposes.&lt;ref name="Pickles"&gt;[https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wms/?id=2011-01-10a.1WS.4 House of Commons statement by Eric Pickles], 10 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations originally stated that a house simply had to be unoccupied for six months and not likely to be occupied in the near future, with a good chance that if an EDMO was granted it would be put back into use.&lt;ref&gt;''Empty Dwelling Management Orders: Guidance for residential property owners'', p.3&lt;/ref&gt; However, this period was extended by the Coalition government following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010]],&lt;ref name="Pickles"/&gt; with the new policy coming into force in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Wendy (2012). [http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN04129/empty-dwelling-management-orders-edmos ''Empty Dwelling Management Orders (EDMOs) - Commons Library Standard Note''].&lt;/ref&gt; The new regulations also require that the property be "causing a nuisance for the community", and that there is local support for the use of an EDMO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.practicallaw.com/uklegislation/uksi/2012/2625/made?view=plain The Housing (Empty Dwelling Management Orders) (Prescribed Period of Time and Additional Prescribed Requirements) (England) (Amendment) Order 2012]. Statutory Instrument 2012 no. 2625.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain classes of property are completely exempt – houses temporarily unoccupied because the resident is in care, for example, or holiday homes. Properties in the process of being sold or let are likewise exempt. The tribunal is not required to grant requests which comply with the requirements, and where it does grant the request there is an appeals process for property owners.&lt;ref&gt;''Empty Dwelling Management Orders: Guidance for residential property owners'', p.4&lt;/ref&gt; The orders cannot be granted for partly occupied buildings – so it cannot be used on an empty set of lodger's rooms within a house – or for non-residential properties.&lt;ref name="Empty Dwelling Management Orders p.5"&gt;''Empty Dwelling Management Orders: Guidance for residential property owners'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Once an interim EDMO has been granted, it lasts for up to twelve months, during which the authority works with the owner to try and agree a way to put the property back into use. The authority is considered legally in [[possession (law)|possession]] (in control) of the property during this time, but does not gain legal ownership; it can change the locks but not sell the house. If no agreement is reached during this time, and the building remains unoccupied, the authority may make a final EDMO, which lasts for up to seven years.&lt;ref name="Empty Dwelling Management Orders p.5"/&gt; A final EDMO differs from an interim EDMO in that the authority is not required to obtain the owner's consent before finding a tenant for the property.&lt;ref&gt;''Empty Dwelling Management Orders: Guidance for residential property owners'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt; If the authority fails to find an occupier for the property, or decides it cannot reasonably get the property occupied, it must hand back possession to the owner.&lt;ref name="Empty Dwelling Management Orders p.5"/&gt;

When a tenant has been found under the EDMO, the rent is paid to the local authority, who are able to recover any costs they may have incurred by taking possession of the property and making it habitable, as well as the routine costs of maintenance and letting. However, any money over and above these costs is to be paid to the owner of the property.&lt;ref&gt;''Empty Dwelling Management Orders: Guidance for residential property owners'', p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fidel Urbina''' (born April 24, 1975)&lt;ref name=FBI /&gt; is a Mexican national&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; former fugitive who was added to the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] list in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/06/fidel-urbina-chicago-murd_n_1573997.html|title=Fidel Urbina, Chicago Murder Suspect, Added To FBI's 10 'Most Wanted' List|date=2012-06-06|publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Urbina is a Mexican national who was working in Chicago as a car mechanic. In March 1998, he allegedly raped a [[Chicago]] waitress in her car and home.&lt;ref name=AMW /&gt; Seven months later—while free on bond—he sexually assaulted and murdered 22-year-old Gabriella Torres, whose body was found in the trunk of a burned-out car in a Chicago alley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2012/june/urbina_060512/urbina_060512 |title=FBI — New Top Ten Fugitive |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
Urbina had been the subject of a manhunt since 1999 despite reported sightings in Mexico. A $100,000 reward was offered for information leading to Urbina's arrest.

Urbina was apprehended September 22, 2016 in Chihuahua, Mexico after 17 years on the run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/chicago/news/press-releases/fbi-top-ten-most-wanted-fugitive-fidel-urbina-arrested |title=FBI — FBI Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitive Fidel Urbina Arrested |publisher=Fbi.gov |date=September 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7380">'''Gogodala''' is the name of an ethnic/language group from the [[Middle Fly District, Western Province|Middle Fly District]] of the [[Western Province (Papua New Guinea)|Western Province]] of [[Papua New Guinea]]. It is one of about a thousand distinct ethnic groups in the country, each which has its own language and culture.  

==Overview==

The Gogodala are a tribe of approximately 25,000, located in 33 villages in Papua New Guinea. Their territory extends from the [[Aramia River]] to the lower [[Fly River]], and it is the most populous Local-Level Government area in the province. Their territory is divided into West, East and Fly areas. The Gogodala occupy mostly the flat terrain and the floodplain areas. (Wilde 2004)

==Culture==
[[Canoe]]s are a very important part of the Gogodala culture. "The Gogodala use of dugout canoes for everyday activities such as fishing, collecting firewood, carrying house posts, transporting sago and garden produce, people also characterize themselves as metaphorically 'being inside', or standing inside, their clan canoe." (Wilde 2004) Canoes are an important means of transport and an aid to hunting. The tribe is located along a river in order to have access to this transportation, in addition to fishing and using the river for water. The network of rivers and water channels enable the Gogodola to have access to a wide area. 

Their origin story says that the Gogodala ancestors traveled to this area in large canoes. The Gogodala trace their lineage to the original members of clans who settled in the area at the time. They also trace their lineage to the canoes which their ancestors used to travel there. (Wilde 2004)

Until the mid-twentieth century, Gogodala villages typically consisted of a single communal thatched-roof longhouse, often more than 100 m. in length.  The longhouse at Isago, constructed in the 1950s, was three stories tall and 127.7 m. long. It was pulled down in 1979.  The Gogodala now live in smaller one- or two-room thatched huts scattered about the village site. (Baldwin 1989)

The Gogodala have a clan-based kinship system. They trace their origins to the eight clans said to originate from Ibali, the father of the Gogodala. It is said that he gave a powerful canoe to each of his eight sons, who were the patriarchs of eight clans. "Within each of the eight clans, people are further divided into several sub-clans, or canoes, which trace their lineage back to the primary ancestor and clan canoe. The premise of this clan and canoe system is a marriage practice that continues to be organized along the lines of a prescribed clan exchange system, referred to elsewhere as 'sister-exchange'." (Wilde 2004)

For males in the Gogodala tribe, their lives are determined by their power or strength, which they call ''kamali.'' "An entity that resides in blood, kamali is the substance responsible for bodily efficacy and health." (Wilde 2004) From this notion the Gogodala derived that a person's ''kamali'' is seen through his work. Vllagers are characterized by how they work in activities such as house-building, [[sago]] making, [[hunting]] and [[gardening]].

==Economy==
In the Gogodala tribes, work is divided along gender lines, with responsibilities based around extended families. Both men and women work and provide assistance when it is needed. Work for men ranges from paid employment in Balimo to hunting, making gardens, building houses, constructing canoes, clearing land, and cutting grass. Jobs for women include rearing children, "cooking, fishing, making [[sago]], sago bags, grass mats and [[fishing basket]]s, collecting firewood and other bush materials for use in the house, caring for animals and maintaining the house." (Wilde 2004) Although the Gogodala "desire the benefits of money, clothes, food, houses, water tanks, electricity and store goods that town people enjoy, town people lament the loss of freedom afforded by the village lifestyle". (Wilde 2004)

The production and preparation of sago, for which women are normally responsible, is important work. Since Gogodala villages are normally near swamps and lagoons, they have access to the proper conditions for growing sago palms. The women often have to travel distances to reach their areas for cultivating the palms.  "Women are primarily responsible for the production and preparation of sago, from cutting down the palm, to cooking and preparing the sago flour for eating." (Dundon 2002) According to the oral history of the people, a male ancestor brought the original sago with him and cultivated it in certain areas for others to collect. If eaten correctly, Sago gives energy. It is very important in Gogodala culture to consume sago. (Dundon 2002)

==Law and religion==
Since the Gogodala are a part of Papua New Guinea, they are governed by a [[National Parliament of Papua New Guinea|Parliament]] that follows [[English common Law]]. The main goal of the courts was to determine certain customs that could be established throughout the whole country but that at the same time would not infringe on the many cultures. Because of the many different cultures in Papua New Guinea, it is extremely difficult to properly enforce the law.

Since the law remains tough to enforce, cultures rely mainly on [[religion]] to establish norms and customs. The main religion in Gogodala tribes is that of [[Christianity]]. While originally there was a very strong opposition to the establishment of the churches, because of [[missionaries]] and the creation of the [[Evangelical Church of Papua]], in 2003 over 90% of the 25,000 Gogodala claimed to be Christian. Ever since its establishment, Christianity has caused immense changes on the Gogodala.

As Christianity became established, missionaries banned [[tobacco smoking]] and drinking of ''i sika'' or ''kava,'' all of which were grown locally. Missionaries also determined that objects and dances that were associated with male initiatory processes, mainly those associated with Aida ceremonies, were not suitable for Christianity. Thus, missionaries and Gogodala Christians traveled to neighboring villages and emphasized that these traditions and objects be banned and destroyed. (Dundon 2002)

'''Guerret El Anz''' is the time of the year, according to the berber calendar, between February 14 and February 19.

This period is known by its cruel cold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalistesfaxien.tn/%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AA/%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%91%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%86%D8%B2/ ماذا تعني “قرّة العنز”؟]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word "Guerret" comes from the [[French language|French]] word "guerre" which means "war" in [[English language|English]].
"El Anz" is an [[Arabic]] word which means "[[goats]]".

This expression describe the intense cold during this period like a war endured by the goats who are not very resistant to the cold due to their fine skins.

== History ==
In [[Tunisia]], it is usual to say "Tjamber Koul w Gamber" ([[Arabic]]: تجمبر كول وقمبر). It is an expression that expresses the need to collect the "oula" and vegetables during "Guerret El Anz".

While in private practice, he was a partner in the law firm of Brackey, Finkelstein and Dallas, and specialized in criminal defense.  In 1987, Finkelstein's license to practice law was suspended after he pleaded no contest to drug possession and driving under the influence.  Prosecutors also accused him of using his position as an attorney to obtain a court order that allowed him to retrieve drugs confiscated from a client.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Reuss,  [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-11-19/news/8702060372_1_henning-possession-prescription-drugs Attorney Given Probation, Fine For Drug Charges], [South Florida Sun-Sentinel],&lt;/ref&gt;

As a public defender for most of the past 34 years, he has represented clients charged with crimes ranging from misdemeanors to murder. As a Chief Assistant Public Defender, Howard was instrumental in forming the first drug court in Florida &lt;ref&gt;Karla D Shore,  [http://www.sfltimes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1339&amp;Itemid=1 Broward Public Defender Praised], [South Florida Times],&lt;/ref&gt; and initiating a misdemeanor and felony mental health court in Broward County.

He also serves as the on-air legal analyst for WSVN Channel 7 News for the past 17 years.  In that capacity he has provided gavel to gavel legal commentary in the case of the State of California vs. O.J. Simpson and has provided ongoing commentary during the U.S. vs. Timothy McVeigh Oklahoma bombing trial, the President Clinton impeachment proceedings, the Princess Diana investigation, Bush vs Gore legal battle for the Presidency, the "nanny" murder trial, INS vs Elian Gonzalez, the Terry Schiavo right to die case and the Marv Albert and Michael Jackson trials.

[[Niger]] is a source, transit, and destination country for children and women subjected to [[trafficking in persons]], specifically [[forced labor]] and [[forced prostitution]]. [[Caste]]-based [[slavery]] practices, rooted in ancestral master-slave relationships, continue primarily in the northern part of the country. [[Child trafficking|Children are trafficked]] within Niger for forced begging by religious instructors known as [[marabout]]s; forced labor in gold mines, agriculture, and stone quarries; as well as for [[involuntary servitude|involuntary]] [[domestic servitude]] and forced [[prostitution]]. The ILO estimates at least 10,000 children work in gold mines in Niger, many of whom may be forced to work. Nigerien children, primarily girls, are also subjected to [[commercial sexual exploitation]] along the border with Nigeria, particularly in the towns of Birni N'Konni and Zinder along the main highway, and boys are trafficked to [[human trafficking in Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[Human trafficking in Mali|Mali]] for forced [[begging]] and [[manual labor]]. There were reports Nigerien girls entered into "[[sham marriage|false marriages]]" with citizens of Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates: upon arrival in these countries, the girls are often forced into involuntary domestic servitude. [[Child marriage]] was a problem, especially in rural areas, and may have contributed to conditions of human trafficking. Niger is a transit country for women and children from [[Human trafficking in Benin|Benin]], [[Human trafficking in Burkina Faso|Burkina Faso]], [[Human trafficking in Gabon|Gabon]], [[Human trafficking in Ghana|Ghana]], Mali, Nigeria, and [[Human trafficking in Togo|Togo]] en route to Northern Africa and Western Europe; some may be subjected to forced labor in Niger as domestic servants, forced laborers in mines and on farms, and as mechanics and welders. To a lesser extent, Nigerien women and children are sometimes trafficked from Niger to North Africa (even if "very few people are involved in human trafficking through the [[Sahara Desert|Sahara]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Julien|last=Brachet|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0002716217744529|title=Manufacturing Smugglers: From Irregular to Clandestine Mobility in the Sahara'|work=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=676|number=1|date=2018|pages=16–35|doi=10.1177/0002716217744529}}&lt;/ref&gt;) the Middle East, and Europe for involuntary domestic servitude and forced commercial [[sexual exploitation]]."&lt;ref name="dos"&gt;"Niger". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142761.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Niger]] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts, including two convictions for traditional [[slavery]] offenses, the Nigerien government lagged in enforcing sentences and in providing victim assistance, particularly to victims of traditional slavery, during the last year.

The [[U.S. State Department]]'s [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2 Watchlist"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The Government of Niger demonstrated improved but limited [[law enforcement]] efforts to address child trafficking and traditional slavery. Niger prohibits slavery through a 2003 amendment to Article 270 of its penal code, and prohibits forced and compulsory labor through Article 4 of its labor code. Penal code Articles 292 and 293 prohibit procurement of a child for [[child prostitution|prostitution]], and Article 181 prohibits encouraging child begging or profiting from child begging. Niger does not, however, prohibit other forms of trafficking, such as forced prostitution of adults. The prescribed penalty of 10 to 30 years' [[imprisonment]] for slavery offenses is sufficiently stringent. The penalty prescribed for forced labor, a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] ranging from $48 to $598 and from six days to one month's imprisonment, is not. The lack of clear anti-trafficking legislation impeded law enforcement efforts: a draft [[law]] prohibiting human trafficking written in 2007 remained pending.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

In the last year, law enforcement authorities arrested several individuals suspected of trafficking children: two suspects were released without being charged, and others were charged with the [[Child abduction|abduction]] of minors. In one case, police and [[prosecutor]]s rescued 78 trafficked children, but made no [[arrest]]s because the children had been sent by their families to look for work. Marabouts arrested for [[Child exploitation|exploiting children]] for economic purposes were released after their [[Pretrial detention|pretrial custody]]. Two alleged trafficking offenders arrested for recruiting six girls and two boys for a prostitution ring in Nigeria were released after serving two months in jail; it is unclear whether this was imprisonment imposed post-conviction or was pretrial detention. In November 2009, the Tribunal of N'Guigmi sentenced a man to five years' imprisonment in addition to a fine of $20,000 in damages to the victim and $2,000 both to the government and an anti-slavery [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]. The defendant was found guilty of maintaining the victim as a slave in his village: at the year's end, the defendant had not [[appeal (law)|appealed]] the sentence and had not paid the amounts ordered by the court.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

There were further developments in the slavery case of Hadidjtou Mani Koraou vs. Souleymane Naroua. In October 2008, the [[Economic Community of West African States|ECOWAS]] Court of Justice ruled the Government of Niger had failed to protect the victim, a former slave, and ordered damages in the amount of $20,000. In July 2009, a local Nigerien court [[conviction|convicted]] and sentenced the defendant to a two-year [[suspended sentence|suspended prison term]], and ordered him to pay $2,000 in damages to the woman he had enslaved and $1,000 to the Government of Niger. The defendant complained the sentence was excessive and filed an appeal before the Court of Appeals of Niamey: the same day, a [[human rights]] NGO also appealed before the same court, claiming the sentence against the trafficking offender was not sufficiently stringent. No date has been set for hearings, and the status of seven other women – who reportedly remained enslaved by the trafficking offender after the complaining victim's escape – is unknown. The whereabouts of the victim's two children, who were also enslaved by the trafficking offender, is also unknown. There were no reported developments in the 2006 slavery case Midi Ajinalher vs. Hamad Alamine.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

Nigerien authorities collaborated with Malian, Togolese, and Nigerian officials in human trafficking investigations, and transferred one suspected trafficker to the custody of [[Interpol]]. A local NGO trained 30 [[police officer|law enforcement officers]] in identifying and assisting trafficking victims. There is no evidence Nigerien officials were complicit in human trafficking crimes.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The Government of Niger demonstrated limited efforts to provide care to child trafficking victims and victims of traditional slavery practices. Authorities identified child trafficking victims in partnership with NGOs and international organizations, but did not report efforts to proactively identify victims of traditional slavery practices. The [[Ministry of the Interior (Niger)|Ministry of the Interior]] continued to operate a program to welcome and provide temporary shelter – for about one week – to [[repatriation|repatriated]] Nigeriens, some of whom may be trafficking victims. While ministry officials interviewed these citizens to assist with their reintegration, they did not attempt to identify trafficking victims among them. Due to lack of resources, the government did not operate its own victim shelter, but refers child trafficking victims to [[NGO]]'s for assistance. While the government lacked a formal system for identification and referral of trafficking victims, authorities referred trafficking victims to NGOs for care on an ad hoc basis. In Agadez, local authorities partnered with [[UNICEF]] and a local NGO to rescue and assist 78 exploited children. In partnership with another local NGO working in Makalondi and Niamey and international organizations, authorities rescued, rehabilitated, and returned to their families 141 exploited children. Out of these 219 children assisted by these two NGOs in 2009, 138 were Nigerien, and the remaining 77 children were from neighboring countries. During the previous year, authorities and NGOs reported assisting 81 child trafficking victims.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

During the year, government officials reported no efforts to assist individuals subjected to traditional slavery practices, compared with providing assistance to 40 such victims during the previous reporting period. The government provided some basic [[health care]] to child trafficking victims and assisted in returning them to their home villages. Authorities encouraged trafficking victims to participate in investigations and [[prosecution]]s, and NGOs assisted victims in filing [[lawsuit]]s and seeking legal action. The government did not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face hardship or [[Revenge|retribution]]. Identified victims were not inappropriately incarcerated or fined for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The Government of Niger made limited efforts to prevent human trafficking through campaigns to educate the public about child trafficking during the reporting period. The government forged partnerships with NGOs and [[international organization]]s, and officials attended workshops and training sessions organized by these entities. During the reporting period, authorities supported a group of local NGOs and associations in organizing a conference on trafficking and exploitation. A multi-agency anti-trafficking commission and a national commission against forced labor and [[discrimination]] existed on paper, but were not fully operational. In 2008, the government partnered with UNICEF to establish regional committees to prevent child trafficking, although the outcome and actions of these committees remained unclear. A 2006 draft anti-trafficking agreement between Niger and Nigeria remained unsigned. The Nigerien government did not take measures to reduce demand for commercial sex acts during the year. Authorities did not report providing [[Army of Niger|Nigerien troops]] deployed abroad as part of [[international peace]]keeping missions with human trafficking awareness training prior to deployment.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2698">The '''Institute for the Study of Academic Racism''' ('''ISAR''') is an organization that monitors "changing intellectual trends in academic [[racism]], biological determinism, and eugenics." ISAR states that in this capacity it "acts as a resource service for students, academics, journalists, legislators and civil rights activists." ISAR was founded by [[Barry Mehler]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/inthebalance/archives/ourgenes/genes_on_trial/genes_meet_mehler.html|title=Our Genes / Our Choices . Genes On Trial . Meet The Participants - PBS|work=www.pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute maintains an online presence housed by, but independent from, [[Ferris State University]].

== Criticism ==
Proponents of [[eugenics]] such as the late [[Glayde Whitney]] accused Mehler of using what they perceive as "inquisition-like" tactics in order to discredit controversial scientists such as [[Raymond Cattell]] and [[Richard Lynn]] on what they considered to be nonscientific grounds. Whitney stated that Mehler combats those he accuses of racism primarily through popular rather than scientific channels (for example TV programs, such as ''[[Geraldo]]'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4852">'''Professor K. V. Gopalaswamy''' (or '''Kurma Venu Gopalaswamy''') ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]: కూర్మా వేణు గోపాలస్వామి) (1903–1983) was an [[Advocate]], [[Playwright]] and Administrator in India. He was first Professor of Law in Andhra University and the first Honorary Professor of Theatre Arts &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andhrauniversity.info/arts/theatrearts/index.html Department of Theatre Arts Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; and Chairman of the Faculty of Arts.

He was born on the December 19, 1903. He was the son of Sir [[Kurma Venkata Reddy Naidu]], the former Governor of [[Madras Presidency]]. He has one sister. He did Bar-at-Law. He was educated at the Oxford Balliol College where he did his Masters. He was later called to the Bar of the Inner temple of United Kingdom.

He was the Private Secretary to the Agent General of India in South Africa in 1930. He came back to India to serve in Andhra University and was appointed as the Registrar, a post he held till his retirement for about 22 years (April 1942 to February 1964).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andhrauniversity.info/reglist.html List of Registrars of Andhra University at AU website.]&lt;/ref&gt; Andhra University was inaugurated in temporary premises at Bezawada in 
the year 1926 by Lord Goschen, the first Chancellor. Goschen was
the Governor of Madras Presidency from April 1924 to June 1929. He was
succeeded by Lord Erskine who was in the chair up to March 1940 except
for a brief interregnum from 18-06-1936 to 01-10-1936. During this period
Kurma Venkata Reddy Naidu was the Governor and ex-officio Chancellor
of Andhra University. Reddy Naidu was also the Chief Minister of the state
for a little over three months in 1937. In April 1942, his son  Kurma
Venugopalaswamy was appointed the Registrar of Andhra University which
post he held till his retirement in February 1964. Thus a father and son
occupied high positions associated with the Andhra University, a rare
phenomenon in the annals of this university. The younger Kurma took active
interest in amateur theatre and it was due to his efforts,the Department of
Theatre Arts was established. The open air theatre known to earlier batches
of students as 'Erskine Square' is now named after him - Kurma 
Venugopalaswamy Arubayalu Rangasthalam, a name as lengthy as the
tenure of his office of the Registrar of Andhra Vishwa Kala Parishat.


He is most remembered for his significant contribution to the world of amateur theatre in [[South India]]. Department of Theatre Arts was established in [[Andhra University]] as a result of his efforts. The Andhra Week celebrations which became famous all over the State were ably organised because of the personal interest evinced by the Vice-Chancellor and the Registrar. Gopalaswamy used to take special care in the conduct of the week-long celebrations every year.

After retirement he held the position of Director of the [[Indian Institute of Management and Commerce]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] in 1973 until 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iimchyderabad.com/profile.html Profile of Indian Institute of Management and Commerce]&lt;/ref&gt;

He played [[Field hockey|hockey]] and [[tennis]] and was the Captain of the Madras Christian College Lawn Tennis Association. He played hockey against many international teams and had the proud privilege of partnering the late Shri [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]] in an international tennis tournament in France.

His birth [[centenary]] celebrations were organised by a committee headed by the AU Vice-Chancellor, [[Y.C. Simhadri]]. They were inaugurated on December 19, 2003, and concluded with the valedictory on January 29, 2004. A souvenir was released with contributory articles from his students and beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2005/02/05/stories/2005020500240200.htm |title=Metro Plus Visakhapatnam / Arts &amp; Crafts : Metro cultural round-up |publisher=The Hindu |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded Honorary Doctorate (D.Litt) by Andhra University in recognition of his services and intellectual contributions on the occasion of the fiftieth convocation in 1977.

Andhra University Open-Air Theatre was named after him by the university authorities as a token of gratitude.

Prof. K.V. Gopalaswamy Memorial All India Playlets Competitions was held organized annually.

He died in 1983.

==Distribution and names==
The Madhiban are a part of the Somali ethnic group found in the [[Horn of Africa]] region, particularly in modern Somalia, Ethiopia, northeastern Kenya, Djibouti and Eritrea.&lt;ref name=madhibanca/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis1999v"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.

According to a 1960 count, they numbered around 20,000 out of 640,000 Somalis in parts of Somalia that were within the then British Protectorate. Their numbers in other parts of Somalia and other Somali regions were unknown.&lt;ref name="Lewis99"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.M.|title=A Pastoral Democracy: A Study of Pastoralism and Politics Among the Northern Somali of the Horn of Africa|date=1999|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=3825830845| pages=7, 14 with footnotes |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=yoMBQCr4LysC|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms Madhiban, Muse Dheri, Midgan or Midgaan for this Somali caste are found in historic literature, but in modern discourse, the term Gaboye is increasingly common. This caste is distinct from the Tumal and Yibir outcast communities because each is accused of things different from each other in Somali society.&lt;ref name=enogaboye/&gt;

==Discussion==
The Madhiban were historically hunters, but now engage in occupations like [[leather work]] ([[shoemaking]]). They also are the traditional circumcision performers for both males,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David F.

According to Lee Gunderson, Dennis Murphy Odo and Reginald D'Silva, the Midgan have traditionally been treated as a low caste, scorned and reviled.&lt;ref name="GundersonOdo2013p98"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lee Gunderson|author2=Dennis Murphy Odo|author3=Reginald D'Silva|title=ESL Literacy Instruction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nak3AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-05238-6|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Midgan-Madiban has been deemed as polluting and therefore avoided as a taboo in the Somali society.&lt;ref name="GundersonOdo2013p98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leonard2013p255"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas M.

Under Somalia's military administration, some Madhiban were appointed to positions within the government to promote integration. The Madhiban have since obtained wider political representation. Their general social status has also improved with the expansion of urban centers.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=I.M.|title=Understanding Somalia and Somaliland: Culture, History, Society|year=2008|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0231700849|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description from 1890==
In 1890 [[Élisée Reclus]], in his extensive work "The Earth and its Inhabitants: AFRICA" (Vol. IV, South and East Africa) described the Madhiban (Midgan) as follows: ''In still greater contempt are held the Midgans, called also Rami, that is to say "Archers," who are universally regarded as the lowest of the low. They worship trees and snakes, and eat all the prohibited food, such as fish, fowl, eggs, hares, and gazelles. They are also daring hunters, fearlessly attacking the lion and the elephant, whom they pierce with their poisoned arrows. Like the Yebirs, the Midgans also practise medicine, and have the reputation of being extremely clever charlatans. According to the Somali legends, the lower castes are the issue of crossings between Abyssinian women and maleficent genii, while the Midgans are of still more degraded origin, their ancestors having been the slaves of these Abyssinian women.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/earthanditsinha01keangoog "The Earth and its Inhabitants: AFRICA", Vol. IV, South and East Africa]. By Élysée Reclus. Edited by A.H. Keane &lt;small&gt;B.A.&lt;/small&gt;, New York, D. Appleton and Company., 1890 (page 399).&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Law==
Under the 1951 UN convention, several legal proceedings have ruled that Midgan as a low caste in Somalia are "akin to [[Dalit]]s or the untouchables in India".&lt;ref name="Dörschner2011p398"/&gt;

==Cognate castes in Horn of Africa==
The Madhiban caste is not an exception limited to the Somali ethnic group, and equivalent cognate caste is found in numerous ethnic groups in [[Horn of Africa]] and [[East Africa]].&lt;ref name=levine57/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shack1964p50"/&gt; According to [[Donald N. Levine|Donald Levine]] – a professor of Sociology specializing in Ethiopian and Horn of Africa studies, similar caste groups in different languages and ethnic groups have been integral part of societies of this region.&lt;ref name=levine57&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald N. Levine|title=Greater Ethiopia: The Evolution of a Multiethnic Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZHeBQAAQBAJ |date=10 December 2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-22967-6|pages=57, 169–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; These strata have featured all the defining characteristics of caste, states Levine, characteristics such as "endogamy, hierarchy, status, concepts of pollution, restraints on commensality, a traditional occupation and membership by birth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald N. Levine|title=Greater Ethiopia: The Evolution of a Multiethnic Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZHeBQAAQBAJ |date=10 December 2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-22967-6|pages=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In east African ethnic groups, such as the [[Oromo people]], cognates to Somali castes have been recorded in 16th century texts, states Cornelius Jaenen.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius J.

[[File:Gynaecology-1822.jpg|thumb|Various methods have been used to protect patient's privacy. This drawing by [[Jacques-Pierre Maygnier]] (1822) shows a "compromise" procedure, in which the [[physician]] is kneeling before the woman but cannot see her genitalia.]]

'''Medical privacy''' or '''health privacy''' is the practice of maintaining the [[Confidentiality|security and confidentiality]] of [[patient]] records. It involves both the conversational discretion of [[Health professional|health care providers]] and the security of [[Medical record|medical records]]. The terms can also refer to the physical [[privacy]] of patients from other patients and providers while in a [[Health facility|medical facility]]. Modern concerns include the degree of disclosure to [[insurance companies]], employers, and other third parties. The advent of [[Electronic medical record|electronic medical records]] (EMR) and patient care management systems (PCMS) have raised new concerns about privacy, balanced with efforts to reduce duplication of services and [[medical errors]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hiller|first=Mare|date=1982|title=“Patient Care Management Systems, Medical Records, and Privacy: A Balancing Act.”|url=|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=97|pages=332-45|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Amalia|date=2009|title=“Privacy Protection and Technology Diffusion: The Case of Electronic Medical Records.”|url=|journal=Management Science|volume=55|pages=1077–1093|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Many countries - including Australia, Canada, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, New Zealand, and the Netherlands - have enacted laws that try to protect people's privacy. However, many of these laws have proven to be less effective in practice than in theory. The United States has passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|(HIPAA]]) as an attempt to increase privacy precautions within medical institutions.

== History of Medical Privacy  ==
Prior to the technological boom, many people relied on a paper medium to file individual's medical data; however, nowadays their information is stored within [[Electronic database|electronic databases]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alpert|first=Sheri|date=1993|title=“Smart Cards, Smarter Policy Medical Records, Privacy, and Health Care Reform.”|url=|journal=The Hastings Center Report|volume=23|pages=13-23|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that it is safer to have information stored within a paper medium as it is harder to physically steal data, yet, now, hackers are able to access large amounts of information without the owner’s knowing online.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In order to reform the healthcare privacy issues in the early 1990's, researchers looked into the use of credit cards and “smart” cards to allow access to their medical information without fear of stolen information. The “smart” card allowed the storage and processing of information to be stored in a singular microchip, yet people were fearful of having so much information stored in a single spot that could easily be accessed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This “smart” card included an individual’s social security number; this is an important piece of identification that can lead to identity theft if  data bases are breached.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, there was a fear that people would target these medical cards because they have information that can be of value to many different third parties including employers, pharmaceutical companies, drug marketers, and insurance reviewers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In response to the lack of medical privacy, there was a movement to create better medical privacy protection, but nothing has been officially passed. The [[Medical Information Bureau]] was thus created to prevent insurance fraud, yet it has since become a significant source of medical information for over 750 life insurance companies; thus, it is very dangerous as it is a target of privacy breachers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although the electronic filing system of medical information has increased efficiency and administration costs have been reduced, there are negative aspects to consider. The electronic filing system allows for individual’s information to be more susceptible to outsiders; even though their information is stored on a singular card. Therefore, the medical card serves as a false sense of security as it does not protect their information completely.

=== Emergence of the Insurance System ===
The emergence of the insurance system was part of the growing democratic movement of the working-class movement.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lengwiler|first=Martin|date=2006|title=“Insurance and Civil Society: Elements of an Ambivalent Relationship.”|url=|journal=Contemporary European History|volume=15|pages=397-416|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the idea of traditional insurance policies was soon overtaken by corporate and social insurance companies who wanted to take advantage of individuals.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; This ultimately caused many individuals to lose the social assistance they needed from the government. This marginalization of individuals ultimately shaped many of the institutions of many civil insurance practices.

In the nineteenth century, insurance policies were not as formal as they currently are, instead there was an ambivalent relationship between democratic institutions and civil policies.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Society was primarily characterized by principles of democracy and elitism which, in theory, should create equality. However, power was concentrated among the elite, causing a feeling of mutuality and exclusivity.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Therefore, many of the policies that should have created inclusivity ultimately caused more people to be marginalized. Realizing this was an issue, there was a call for inclusivity and sociability which led to new cautions regarding medical privacy and ability to access individual information.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

As a result, during the twentieth century, there was a change within the insurance industry which caused a new development of medical policies on how to handle individual's medical information.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; There was a shift from being selective to broadening the qualifications of being able to receive insurance help. With the end of exclusiveness within the insurance market, the government started to regulate the market more and thus emerged the fear of lack of privacy.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Ideas of transparency caused many people to become wary of privacy violation rights. This led to modern day advocacy groups that argued for larger protections and regulations of insurance companies.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; As a result, in today's society, the government plays a large role in enforcing these roles within society. Since then, the government has had the role of enforcing these regulations to protect individual’s information and data.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

=== Patient care management systems (PCMS) ===
With the technological boom, there has been an expansion of the record filing system and many hospitals have therefore adopted new PCMS.&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hiller|first=Mare|date=1982|title=“Patient Care Management Systems, Medical Records, and Privacy: A Balancing Act.”|url=|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=97|pages=332-45|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCMS are large medical records that hold many individual's personal data. These have become critical to the efficiency of storing medical information because of high volumes of paperwork, the ability to quickly share information between medical institutions, and the increased mandatory reporting to the government.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt; PCMS have ultimately increased the productivity of data record utilization and have created a large dependence on technology within the medical field.

Yet, it has also led to social and ethical issues because of the basic human rights that can be a casualty for this expansion of knowledge. Hospitals and health information services are now more likely to share information with third party companies.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt; Thus, there needs to be a reform to specify the rules of the hospital personnel who have the access to medical records. This has led to the discussion of privacy rights and created safeguards that will help data keepers understand situations where it is ethical to share an individual’s medical information, provide ways for individuals to gain access to their own records, and determine who has ownership of those records.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt; Additionally, it is used to ensure that a person’s identity is kept confidential in research or statistical purposes and understand the process to make individual’s aware that their health information is being used.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt; Thus, a balance between privacy and confidentiality must occur in order to limit the amount of information disclosed and keep the occupations of physicians in check by constricting the information flow

=== Electronic Medical Records (EMR) ===
[[Electronic Medical Records|Electronic medical records]] (EMR) are a more efficient way of storing medical information, yet there are many negative aspects of this type of filing system as well. Hospitals are willing to adopt this type of filing system, yet only if they are able to ensure the protection of patient information.&lt;ref name=":73"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Amalia|date=2009|title=“Privacy Protection and Technology Diffusion: The Case of Electronic Medical Records.”|url=|journal=Management Science|volume=55|pages=1077–1093|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers found that state legislation and regulation of medical privacy laws reduce the amount of hospitals that adopt EMR by more than 24%.&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt; This is ultimately due to the decreasing positive network externalities that are created by additional state protections.&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt; With increases in restrictions against the diffusion of medical information, hospitals have neglected to adopt the new EMR’s because privacy laws restrict health information exchanges. With decreasing amounts of medical institutions adopting the EMR filing system, the federal government’s plan to have a national health network will be stopped.&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt; The national network will ultimately cost the US $156 billion in investments, yet in order for this to happen, the government needs to place higher emphasis on protecting individual medical privacy.&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt; Many politicians and business leaders find that EMR’s allow for more efficiency in both time and money, yet they neglect to address the decreasing privacy protections, demonstrating the significant trade off between EMR’s and individual privacy.&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt;

==== Privacy and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) ====
The three goals of [[information security]], including electronic information security, are [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]], and [[availability]]. Organizations are attempting to meet these goals, referred to as the [[Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act|C.I.A. Triad,]] which is the "practice of defending information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction."

In a 2004 editorial in the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', U.S. Senators [[Bill Frist]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] supported this observation, stating "[patients] need...information, including access to their own health records... At the same time, we must ensure the privacy of the systems, or they will undermine the trust they are designed to create". A 2005 report by the [[California Health Care Foundation]] found that "67 percent of national respondents felt 'somewhat' or 'very concerned' about the privacy of their personal medical records".

The importance of privacy in electronic health records became prominent with the passage of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] (ARRA) in 2009. One of the provisions (known as the [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act|Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health]] [HITECH] Act) of the ARRA mandated incentives to clinicians for the implementation of electronic health records by 2015.Privacy advocates in the United States have raised concerns about unauthorized access to personal data as more medical practices switch from paper to electronic medical records. The [[Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology]] (ONC) explained that some of the safety measures that EHR systems can utilize are passwords and pin numbers that control access to such systems, encryption of information, and an audit trail to keep track of the changes made to records.

Providing patient access to EHRs is strictly mandated by HIPAA's Privacy Rule. One study found that each year there are an estimated 25 million compelled authorizations for the release of personal health records. Researchers, however, have found new security threats open up as a result. Some of these security and privacy threats include [[Hacker|hackers]], [[Computer virus|viruses]], and [[Computer worm|worms]]. These privacy threats are made more prominent by the emergence of "[[cloud computing]]", which is the use of shared computer processing power. Health care organizations are increasingly using cloud computing as a way to handle large amounts of data. This type of [[Data storage tag|data storage]], however, is susceptible to [[Natural disaster|natural disasters]], [[cybercrime]] and [[Cyberterrorism|technological terrorism]], and hardware failure. Health information breaches accounted for the 39 percent of all breaches in 2015.

==== Health screening cases ====
Although privacy issues with the health screening is a great concern among individuals and organizations, there has been little focus on the amount of work being done within the law to maintain the privacy expectation that people desire.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simms|first=Michele|date=1994|title=“Defining Privacy in Employee Health Screening Cases: Ethical Ramifications Concerning the Employee/Employer Relationship.”|url=|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=13|pages=315-325|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these issues lie within the abstractness of the term “privacy” as there are many different interpretations of the term, especially in the context of the law.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Prior to 1994, there had been no cases regarding screening practices and the implications towards an individual’s medical privacy, unless it was regarding HIV and drug testing.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Within ''Glover v Eastern Nebraska Community Office of Retardation'', an employee sued her employer against violating her [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th amendment]] rights because of unnecessary [[HIV Testing|HIV testing]].&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; The court ruled in favor of the employer and argued that it was unreasonable search to have it tested. However, this was only one of the few precedents that people have to use. With more precedents, the relationships between employees and employers will be better defined. Yet with more requirements, testing among patients will lead to additional standards for meeting health care standards.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; [[Screening (medicine)|Screening]] has become a large indicator for diagnostic tools, yet there are concerns with the information that can be gained and subsequently shared with other people other than the patient and healthcare provider

=== Third party issues ===
One of the main dangers to an individual’s privacy are private corporations because of the profits they can receive from privacy-violating information.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Etzioni|first=Amitai|date=2000|title=“The New Enemy of Privacy: Big Bucks.”|url=|journal=Challenge|volume=43|pages=91-106|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy merchants are made up of two groups - one that tries to collect people’s personal information while the other focuses on using client’s information to market company products.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Subsequently, privacy merchants purchase information from other companies, such as health insurance companies, if there is not sufficient information from their own research.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Privacy merchants target health insurance companies because, nowadays, they collect huge amounts of personal information and keep them in large databases. They often require patients to provide more information that is needed for purposes other than that of doctors and other medical workers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Additionally, people’s information can be linked to other information outside of the medical field. For example, many employers use insurance information and medical records as an indicator of work ability and ethic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The selling of privacy information can also lead employers to make lots of money; however, this happens to many people without their consent or knowledge.

Within the United States, in order to define clear privacy laws regarding medical privacy, Title 17 thoroughly explains the ownership of one’s data and adjusted the law so that people have more control over their own property.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zittrain|first=Jonathan|date=2000|title=“What the Publisher Can Teach the Patient: Intellectual Property and Privacy in an Era of Trusted Privication.”|url=|journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=52|pages=1201-50|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Privacy Act of 1974 offers more restrictions regarding what corporations can access outside of an individual’s consent.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

States have created additional supplements to medical privacy laws. With HIPAA, many individuals were pleased to see the federal government take action in protecting the medical information of individuals. Yet when people looked into it, there was proof that the government was still protecting the rights of corporations.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Many rules were seen as more of suggestions and the punishment for compromising the privacy of its patients were minimal.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Even if release of medical information requires consent, blank authorizations can be allowed and will not ask for individuals for additional consent later on.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Although there is a large group of people who oppose the selling of individual’s medical information, there are groups such as the Health Benefits Coalition, the [[Healthcare Leadership Council]], and the [[America's Health Insurance Plans|Health Insurance Association of America]] that are against the new reforms for data protection as it can ruin their work and profits.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, it is not the government that is the reason for many issues with medical privacy, but it is the large corporations that are trying to make profits off of our data.

==== Recent Efforts to Protect Health Information ====
With the lack of help from the Department of Health and Human Services there is a conflict of interest that has been made clear. Some wish to place individual betterment as more important, while others focus more on external benefits from outside sources. The issues that occur when there are problems between the two groups are also not adequately solved which leads to controversial laws and effects.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van der Goes, Jr.|first=Peter|date=1999|title=“Opportunity Lost: Why and How to Improve the HHS-Proposed Legislation Governing Law Enforcement Access to Medical Records.”|url=|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|volume=147|pages=1009-1067|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual interests take precedence over the benefits of society as a whole and are often viewed as selfish and for the gain of capital value. If the government does not make any more future changes to the current legislation, countless organizations and people will have access to individual medical information.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

In 1999, the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act|Gramm-Leach-Biley]] Act (GLBA) addressed the insurance privacy debate regarding medical privacy.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zielezienski|first=Stephen|date=2002|title="Insurance Privacy after Gramm-Leach-Bililey- Old Concerns, New Protections, Future Challenges|url=|journal=Tort &amp; Insurance Law Journal|volume=37|pages=1139-1179|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, there were many issues with the implementation. One issue was that there were inconsistent regulation requirements within the different states due to preexisting laws.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Secondly, it was difficult to combine the pre-existing laws with the new framework.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; And thirdly, in order for the federal government to implement these new rules, the they needed state legislature to pass it.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

GLBA aimed to regulate financial institutions so that corporations could not affect people’s insurance. Because of the difficulty of the implementation of the GBLA, state legislatures are able to interpret the laws themselves and create initiatives to protect the medical privacy.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; When states are creating their own independent legislature, they create standards that understand the impact of the legislation.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; If they stray from the standard laws, they must be valid and fair. The new legislation must protect the rights of businesses and allow them to continue to function despite federally regulated competition. Patients gain benefits from these new services and standards through the flow of information that is considerate with medical privacy expectations. &lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

These regulations should focus more on the consumer versus the benefits and political exploitation. Many times, regulations are for the personal gain of the corporation, therefore, state legislatures be wary of this and try to prevent it to the best of their abilities.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Medical privacy is not a new issue within the insurance industry, yet the problems regarding exploitation continue to reoccur; there is more focus on taking advantage of the business environment for personal gain.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

In 2001, President George W. Bush passed additional regulations to [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] in order to better protect the privacy of individual medical information.&lt;ref name=":142"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gostin|first=Lawrence|date=2002|title=“The Nationalization of Health Information Privacy Protections .”|url=|journal=Tort &amp; Insurance Law Journal|volume=37|pages=1113-1138|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new regulations were supposed to safeguard health information privacy by creating extensive solutions for the privacy of patients. The new regulation goals included being notified once an individual's information is inspected, amend any medical records, and request communication opportunities to discuss information disclosure.&lt;ref name=":142" /&gt;

However, there are exceptions to when the disclosure of PHI can be inspected. This includes specific conditions among law enforcements, judicial and administrative proceedings, parents, significant others, public health, health research, and commercial marketing.&lt;ref name=":142" /&gt; These aspects of lack of privacy have caused an alarming amount of gaps within privacy measures.

Ultimately, there is still an issue on how to ensure privacy securities; in response, the government has created new regulations that makes trade offs between an individual's privacy and public benefit. These new regulations, however, still cover individually identifiable health information - any data that contains information unique to an individual.&lt;ref name=":142" /&gt; However, non identifiable data is not covered as the government claims it will cause minimal damage to a person’s privacy. In addition, it also covers all health care organizations, covers businesses as well.

Additionally, under new HIPAA additions, the state legislation is more protective than national laws because it created more obligations for organizations to follow. Ultimately, the new rules called for expansive requirements that created better safety measures for individuals.&lt;ref name=":142" /&gt; Yet, there are still ways that businesses and healthcare organizations can be exempt from disclosure rules for all individuals. Thus, the HHS needs to find more ways to balance personal and public trade offs within medical laws. This creates a need for extra government intervention to enforce legislation and new standards to decrease the amount of threats against an individual’s privacy of health data.

== Effects of changing medical privacy laws ==

=== Physician-Patient Relationships ===
Patients want to be able to share medical information with their physicians, yet they worry about potential privacy breaches that can occur when they release financial and confidential medical information.&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hosek|first=Susan|date=2013|title=“Privacy of Individual Health Information.”|url=|journal=Patient Privacy, Consent, and Identity Management in Health Information Exchange: Issues for the Military Health System|volume=|pages=19-30|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to ensure better protection, the government has created frameworks for keeping information confidential - this includes being transparent about procedures, disclosure and protection of information, and monitoring of these new rules to ensure that people’s information..&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hosek|first=Susan|date=2013|title=“Privacy of Individual Health Information.”|url=|journal=Patient Privacy, Consent, and Identity Management in Health Information Exchange: Issues for the Military Health System|volume=|pages=19-30|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effects of Technological Advances regarding physician-patient relationships ====
Recently physicians and patients have started to use email as an additional communication tool for treatment and medical interactions. This way of communication is not “new”, but its effects on doctor patient relationships has created new questions regarding legal, moral, and financial problems.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wieczorek|first=Susan|date=2010|title=“From Telegraph to E-mail: Preserving the Doctor-Patient Relationship in a High-Tech Environment"|url=|journal=ETC: A Review of General Semantics|volume=67|pages=311–327|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Medical Informatics Association]] has characterized medical emails as way to communicate “medical advice, treatment, and information exchanged professionally”; yet, the “spontaneity, permanence, and information power characterizing” role is significant because of its unknown affects.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt; However, the use of emails allows for increased access, immediate aid, and increased interactions between patients and doctors.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt; There are many benefits and negative aspects of using emails; doctors feel a new sense of negative responsibility to respond to emails outside of the office, but also find benefits with facilitating rapid responses to patient’s questions.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt;

Additionally, the use of email between physicians and their patients will continue to grow because of the increasing use of the Internet. With the Internet, patients are able to ask for medical advice and treatment, yet issues regarding confidentiality and legal issues come up.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt; Ultimately, emails between a physician and patient are supposed to be used as a supplement for face to face interactions, not for casual messages. If used properly, physicians could use emails as a way to supplement interactions and provide more medical aid to those who need it immediately.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt;

==== Traditional beliefs on doctor-patient relationship that spur fear ====
Although many people believe that the technological changes are the reason for fear of sharing medical privacy, there is a theory that states that institutional ideals between doctors and their patients have created the fear of sharing medical privacy information.&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradburn|first=Norman|date=2001|title=“Medical Privacy and Research.”|url=|journal=The Journal of Legal Studies|volume=30|pages=687–701|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although levels of confidentiality are changing, individuals often feel the need to share more information with their doctors in order to get diagnosed correctly.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt; Because of this, people are concerned with how much information their physicians have. This information could be transferred to other third party companies. However, there is a call for smaller emphasis on sharing and confidentiality in order to rid patients from their fears of information breaching.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt; There is a common belief that the confidentiality of one’s information also only protects the doctors and not the patients, therefore there is a negative stigma towards revealing too much information.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt; Thus it causes patients to not share vital information relevant to their illnesses.

=== Australia – eHealth ===
{{Tone|section|date=June 2015}}
On July 1, 2012, the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] launched the [[Personally Controlled Electronic Health Record]] (PCEHR) (eHealth) system.&lt;ref name="PCEHR Governance"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Government - Department of Health and Ageing|url=http://www.yourhealth.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publishing.nsf/Content/pcehr-governance#.UZbkq5UWFFJ|website=PCEHR Governance|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the system is fully implemented, it will incorporate an electronic summary prepared by nominated healthcare providers along with consumer-provided notes. Further, the summary will include information on the individual's allergies, adverse reactions, medications, immunizations, diagnoses, and treatments. The consumer notes will operate as a personal medical diary that only the individual can view and edit.&lt;ref name="NEHTA"&gt;{{cite web|title=National E-Health Transition Authority (NEHTA)|url=http://www.nehta.gov.au/our-work/pcehr|website=Our Work - PCEHR|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[opt-in]] system gives people the option to choose whether to register for the eHealth record or not.&lt;ref name="opt-in model"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Government - Department of Health and Ageing|url=http://www.yourhealth.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publishing.nsf/Content/pcehr-benefits#.UZcW8pUWHFJ|website=Expected benefits of the national PCEHR system|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Privacy – Governance ====
The [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012A00063 Personally Controlled Electronic Health Records Act 2012] and [[Privacy Act 1988]] governs how eHealth record information is managed and protected.&lt;ref name="ComLaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Government - ComLaw|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012A00063|website=Personally Controlled Electronic Health Records Act 2012|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PCEHR System Operator abides by the [http://www.privacy.gov.au/materials/types/infosheets/view/6541 Information Privacy Principles] in the Privacy Act 1988 (Commonwealth) as well as any applicable State or Territory privacy laws.&lt;ref name="IPPs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Government - Office of the Australian Information Commissioner|url=http://www.privacy.gov.au/materials/types/infosheets/view/6541|website=Information Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [http://www.ehealth.gov.au/internet/ehealth/publishing.nsf/Content/ehealth_privacy Privacy Statement] sets out the application of the collection of personal information by the System Operator.

==== Privacy – Security measures ====
Security measures include audit trails so that patients can see who has accessed their medical records along with the time the records were accessed. Other measures include the use of encryption as well as secure logins and passwords. Patient records are identified using an [http://www.nehta.gov.au/our-work/healthcare-identifiers-hi Individual Health Identifier (IHI)], assigned by [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]], the IHI service provider.&lt;ref name="Privacy Statement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Showell"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Showell|first=CM|title=Citizens, patients and policy: a challenge for Australia's national electronic health record|journal=Health Information Management Journal|year=2011|volume=40|issue=2|pages=39–43|doi=10.1177/183335831104000206|pmid=28683627}} [http://www.himaa.org.au/members/journal/HIMJ_40_2_2011/HIMJ%2040-2%20Showell%20Challenge%20for%20national%20e-health%20record.pdf http://www.himaa.org.au/members/journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Privacy – Issues ====
A 2012 nationwide survey in Australia assessed privacy concerns on patients' health care decisions, which could impact patient care.  Results listed that 49.1% of Australian patients stated they have withheld or would withhold information from their health care provider based on privacy concerns.&lt;ref name="ANJ"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anonymous|title=e-Health|journal=Australian Nursing Journal|year=2012|volume=20|issue=2|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''How does consent impact privacy?'''

One concern is that personal control of the eHealth record via consent does not guarantee the protection of privacy. It is argued that a narrow definition, 'permission' or 'agreement', does not provide protection for privacy and is not well represented in Australian legislation. The PCEHR allows clinicians to assume consent by consumer participation in the system; however, the needs of the consumer may not be met. Critics argue that the broader definition of 'informed consent' is required, as it encompasses the provision of relevant information by the healthcare practitioner, and understanding of that information by the patient.&lt;ref name="Spriggs"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/medethics-2011-100413 |pmid=22573881 |title=Ethical questions must be considered for electronic health records |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=38 |issue=9 |pages=535–539 |year=2012 |last1=Spriggs |first1=Merle |last2=Arnold |first2=Michael V |last3=Pearce |first3=Christopher M |last4=Fry |first4=Craig |url=http://vuir.vu.edu.au/10529/ |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Is it legitimate to use personal information for public purposes?'''

Data from the PCEHR is to be predominantly used in patient healthcare, but other uses are possible, for policy, research, audit and public health purposes.  The concern is that in the case of research, what is allowed goes beyond existing privacy legislation.&lt;ref name="Spriggs" /&gt;

*'''What are ‘illegitimate’ uses of health information?'''

The involvement of pharmaceutical companies is viewed as potentially problematic. If they are perceived by the public to be more concerned with profit than public health, public acceptance of their use of PCEHRs could be challenged. Also perceived as problematic, is the potential for parties other than health care practitioners, such as insurance companies, employers, police or the government, to use information in a way which could result in discrimination or disadvantage.&lt;ref name="Spriggs" /&gt;

*'''What are the potential implications of unwanted disclosure of patient information?'''
  
Information 'leakage' is seen as having the potential to discourage both patient and clinician from participating in the system. Critics argue the PCEHR initiative can only work, if a safe, effective continuum of care within a trusting patient/clinician relationship is established. If patients lose trust in the confidentiality of their eHealth information, they may withhold sensitive information from their health care providers. Clinicians may be reluctant to participate in a system where they are uncertain about the completeness of the information.&lt;ref name="Liaw et al"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21843131 |url=https://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/195_04_150811/lia10586_letter_fm.html |year=2011 |last1=Liaw |first1=S. T |title=Can we trust the PCEHR not to leak? |journal=The Medical Journal of Australia |volume=195 |issue=4 |pages=222 |last2=Hannan |first2=T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Are there sufficient safeguards for the protection of patient information?'''

Security experts have questioned the registration process, where those registering only have to provide a [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] card number, and names and birth dates of family members to verify their identity. Concerns have also been raised by some stakeholders, about the inherent complexities of the limited access features. They warn that access to PCEHR record content, may involve transfer of information to a local system, where PCEHR access controls would no longer apply.&lt;ref name="Showell" /&gt;

===Canada===

The privacy of patient information is protected at both the [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act|federal level]] and [[Personal Health Information Protection Act|provincial level]] in [[Canada]].  The health information legislation established the rules that must be followed for the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health information by healthcare workers known as "custodians". These custodians have been defined to include almost all healthcare professionals (including all physicians, nurses, chiropractors, operators of ambulances and operators of nursing homes). In addition to the regulatory bodies of specific healthcare workers, the provincial privacy commissions are central to the protection of patient information.

Much of the current legislation concerning privacy and patient information was enacted since 2000 as a result of the proliferation of the use electronic [[Mobile device|mobile devices]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=27054136 |pmc=4806754 |year=2016 |last1=Chan |first1=N |title=Should 'smart phones' be used for patient photography? |journal=Plastic Surgery (Oakville, Ont.) |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=32–4 |last2=Charette |first2=J |last3=Dumestre |first3=D. O |last4=Fraulin |first4=F. O }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, both large and small private businesses created smartphone and [[Electronic Medical Record|EMR]] solutions that comply with applicable legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://about.telus.com/community/english/news_centre/news_releases/blog/2013/03/04/telus-health-is-now-canada-s-largest-electronic-medical-record-provider|title=About TELUS|website=about.telus.com|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===

The privacy of patient information is guaranteed by articles 78 and 100 of legal code 5510.

On the other hand, the [[Social Security Institution]] (SGK), which regulates and administers state-sponsored social security / insurance benefits, sells patient information after allegedly anonimizing the data, confirmed on October 25, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Sağlık Bakanlığı SGK bilgilerini sattığını doğruladı: İsim vermeden sattık" ("The Miistry of Health confirms the sale of information [to third parties] through SGK database: 'We sold [data] without [patients'] names'")|url=http://www.birgun.net/news/view/saglik-bakanligi-sgk-bilgilerini-sattigini-dogruladi-isim-vermeden-sattik/7770|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026172611/http://www.birgun.net/news/view/saglik-bakanligi-sgk-bilgilerini-sattigini-dogruladi-isim-vermeden-sattik/7770|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 October 2014|website=Birgün|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The [[National Health Service]] is increasingly using [[electronic health record]]s, but until recently, the records held by individual NHS organisations, such as General Practitioners, [[NHS Trust]]s, dentists and pharmacies, were not linked. Each organisation was responsible for the protection of patient data it collected. The [[Health and Social Care Information Centre#care.data|care.data]] programme, which proposed to extract anonymised data from GP surgeries into a central database, aroused considerable opposition.

In 2003, the NHS made moves to create a centralized electronic registry of medical records. The system is protected by the UK's [[UK government websites|Government Gateway]], which was built by [[Microsoft]].  This program is known as the Electronic Records Development and the Implementation Programme (ERDIP). The NHS [[NHS Connecting for Health|National Program for IT]] was  criticized for its lack of security and lack of patient privacy. It was one of the projects that caused the [[Information Commissioner's Office|Information Commissioner]] to warn{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} about the danger of the country "sleepwalking" into a [[mass surveillance|surveillance society]]. Pressure groups{{according to whom|date=April 2015}} opposed to [[ID card]]s also campaigned against the centralized registry.

Newspapers feature stories about lost computers and memory sticks but a more common and longstanding problem is about staff accessing records that they have no right to see.  It has always been possible for staff to look at paper records, and in most cases, there is no track of record.  Therefore, electronic records make it possible to keep track of who has accessed which records. [[NHS Wales]] has created the National Intelligent Integrated Audit System which provides "a range of automatically generated reports, designed to meet the needs of our local health boards and trusts, instantly identifying any potential issues when access has not been legitimate".  [[Maxwell Stanley Consulting]] will use a system called Patient Data Protect (powered by VigilancePro) which can spot patterns – such as whether someone is accessing data about their relatives or colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paperless NHS supplement: Data protection – it's a breach of trust|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/resource-centre/supplements/paperless-nhs-supplement-data-protection-its-a-breach-of-trust/5083120.article#.VT_-Zoq4_eM|accessdate=28 April 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Nurse using paper shredder on confidential records.jpg|thumbnail|right|A nurse shredding papers in order to be compliant with the physical safeguard section of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).]]Se''e: [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996]]''

Since 1974, numerous federal laws have been passed in the United States to specify the privacy rights and protections of patients, physicians, and other covered entities to medical data. Many states have passed its own laws to try and better protect the medical privacy of their citizens.

An important national law regarding medical privacy is the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996]] (HIPAA), yet there are many controversies regarding the protection rights of the law.

==== Oregon-Specific Laws ====
The Oregon Genetic Privacy Act (GPA) states that “an individual’s genetic information is the property of the individual”.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Everett|first=Margaret|date=2007|title=“The ‘I’ in the Gene: Divided Property, Fragmented Personhood, and the Making of a Genetic Privacy Law.”|url=|journal=American Ethnologist|volume=34|pages=375-86|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of an individual’s DNA being compared to property occurred when research caused an individual’s privacy to be threatened. Many individuals believed that their genetic information was “more sensitive, personal, and potentially damaging than other types of medical information.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Thus, people started calling for more protections. People started to question the how their DNA would be able to stay anonymous within research studies and argued that the identity of an individual could be exposed if the research was later shared. As a result, there was a call for individuals to treat their DNA as property and protect it through property rights. Therefore, individuals can control the disclosure of their information without extra questioning and research.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Many people believed that comparing one’s DNA to property was inappropriate, yet individuals argued that property and privacy are interconnected because they both want to protect the right to control one’s body.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Many research and pharmaceutical companies showed opposition because they were worried about conflicts that might arise regarding privacy issues within their work. Individuals, on the other hand, continued to support the act because they wanted protection over their own DNA.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As a result, lawmakers created a compromise that included a property clause, that would give individuals protection rights, but also included provisions that would allow research to be done without much consent, limiting the benefits of the provisions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Afterwards, a committee was created to study the effects of the act and how it affected the way it was analyzed and stored.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; They found that the act benefited many individuals who did not want their privacy being shared with others and therefore the law was officially implemented in 2001.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In order to solve HIPAA issues within Connecticut, state legislatures tried to create better provisions to protect the people living within the state.&lt;ref name=":132"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butera|first=Adam|date=2002|title="HIPAA Preemption Implications for Covered Entities Under State Law"|url=|journal=Tort &amp; Insurance Law Journal|volume=37|pages=1181–1211|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the issues that Connecticut tried to solve were issues with consent. Within the consent clause, health plans and health care clearinghouses do not need to receive consent from individuals because of a general provider consent form with gives healthcare providers permission to disclose all medical information.&lt;ref name=":132" /&gt; The patient thus does not get notification when their information is being shared afterwards.&lt;ref name=":132" /&gt;

Connecticut, like many other states, tried to protect individual’s information from disclosure of information through additional clauses that would protect them from businesses initiatives.&lt;ref name=":132" /&gt; In order to do so, Connecticut legislature passed the Connecticut Insurance Information and Privacy Protect Act, which provides additional protections of individual medical information. If third parties neglect to follow this law, they will be fined, may face jail time, and may have their licenses suspended.&lt;ref name=":132" /&gt; Yet, even in these additional provisions, there were many holes within this legislation that allowed for businesses agreements to be denied and subsequently, information was compromised. Connecticut is still working to shift its divergent purposes to creating more stringent requirements that create better protections through clear provisions of certain policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://medcitynews.com/2013/09/10-things-need-know-hipaa-omnibus-final-rule/|title=10 things you need to know about HIPAA Omnibus final rule|last=Baum|first=Stephanie|date=2013-09-23|website=MedCity News|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== California-Specific Laws ====
In [[California]], the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA), provides more stringent protections than the federal statutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eff.org/issues/law-and-medical-privacy|title=The Law and Medical Privacy|newspaper=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIPAA expressly provides that more stringent state laws like CMIA, will override HIPAA's requirements and penalties. More specifically, CMIA prohibits providers, contractors and health care service plans from disclosing PHI without prior authorization.

These medical privacy laws also set a higher standard for health IT vendors or vendors of an individual's [[Personal health record|personal health record (PHR)]] by applying such statutes to vendors, even if they are not business associates of a covered entity. CMIA also outlines penalties for violating the law. These penalties range from liability to the patient (compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, costs of litigation) to civil and even criminal liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=60736ad0-ee84-48d0-a03c-d62d51f80309|title=What you don't know about California's Confidentiality of Medical Information Act might hurt you! {{!}} Lexology|last=Henry|first=Davis Wright Tremaine LLP-Karen A.|last2=Keville|first2=Terri D.|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, California's Insurance Information and Privacy Protection Act&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=INS&amp;division=1.&amp;title=&amp;part=2.&amp;chapter=1.&amp;article=6.6.|title=California Legislative Information|last=|first=|date=|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; (IIPPA) protects against unauthorized disclosure of PHI by prohibiting unapproved information sharing for information collected from insurance applications and claims resolution.

=== Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) ===
The most comprehensive law passed is the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996]] (HIPAA), which was later revised after the Final Omnibus Rule in 2013. HIPAA provides a federal minimum standard for medical privacy, sets standards for uses and disclosures of [[Protected health information|protected health information (PHI)]], and provides civil and criminal penalties for violations.

Prior to HIPAA, only certain groups of people were protected under medical laws such as individuals with HIV or those who received Medicare aid.&lt;ref name=":133"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butera|first=Adam|date=2002|title="HIPAA Preemption Implications for Covered Entities Under State Law"|url=|journal=Tort &amp; Insurance Law Journal|volume=37|pages=1181–1211|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIPAA provides protection of health information and supplements additional state and federal laws; yet it should be understood that the law’s goal is to balance public health benefits, safety, and research while protecting the medical information of individuals. Yet many times, privacy is compromised for the benefits of the research and public health.

According to HIPAA, the covered entities that must follow the law's set mandates are health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers that electronically transmit PHI. Business associates of these covered entities are also subject to HIPAA's rules and regulations.

In 2008, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act|Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA)]], which aimed to prohibit [[genetic discrimination]] for individuals seeking health insurance and employment. The law also included a provision which mandated that genetic information held by employers be maintained in a separate file and prohibited disclosure of genetic information except in limited circumstances.

In 2013, after GINA was passed, the HIPAA Omnibus Rule amended HIPAA regulations to include genetic information in the definition of Protected Health Information (PHI). This rule also expanded HIPAA by broadening the definition of business associates to include any entity that sends or accesses PHI such as [[Health information technology|health IT]] vendors.

==== Controversies regarding HIPAA ====
Contrary to the popular belief, the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) does not provide strong medical privacy protections as it only provides regulations that disclose certain information.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sobel|first=Richard|date=2007|title=“The HIPAA Paradox: The Privacy Rule That’s Not.”|url=|journal=Hastings Center Report|volume=37|pages=40-50|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government authorizes the access of an individual’s health information for “treatment, payment, and health care options without patient consent”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, HIPAA rules are very broad and do not protect an individual from unknown privacy threats. Additionally, a patient would not be able to identify the reason for breach due to inconsistent requirements.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because of limited confidentiality, HIPAA facilitates the sharing of medical information as there is little limitation from different organizations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Information can easily be exchanged between medical institutions and other non-medical institutions because of the little regulation of HIPAA - some effects  include job loss due to credit score sharing or loss of insurance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Additionally, doctors are not required to keep patients information confidential because in many cases patient consent is now optional. Patients are often unaware of the lack of privacy they have as medical processes and forms do not explicitly state the extent of how protected they are.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Physicians believe that overall, HIPAA will cause unethical and non-professional mandates that can affect a person’s privacy and therefore, they in response have to provide warnings about their privacy concerns.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because physicians are not able to ensure a person’s privacy, there is a higher chance that patients will be less likely to get treatment and share what their medical concerns are.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Individuals have asked for better consent requirements by asking if physicians can warn them prior to the sharing of any personal information.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hosek|first=Susan|date=2013|title=“Privacy of Individual Health Information.”|url=|journal=Patient Privacy, Consent, and Identity 
Management in Health Information Exchange: Issues for the Military Health System,|volume=|pages=19-30|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients want to be able to share medical information with their physicians, yet they worry about potential breaches that can release financial information and other confidential information and with that fear, they are wary of who may have access.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In order to ensure better protection, the government has created frameworks for keeping information confidential - some of which include being transparent about procedures, disclosure and protection of information, and monitoring of these new rules to ensure that people’s information is not affected by breaches.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although there are many frameworks to ensure the protection of basic medical data, many organizations do not have these provisions in check. HIPAA gives a false hope to patients and physicians as they are unable to protect their own information. Patients have little rights regarding their medical privacy rights and physicians cannot guarantee those.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sobel|first=Richard|date=2007|title=The HIPAA Paradox: The Privacy Rule That’s Not|journal=Hastings Center Report|volume=37|pages=40-50|doi=10.1353/hcr.2007.0062|jstor=4625762|pmid=17844923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== HIPAA and Hurricane Katrina =====
HIPAA does not protect the information of individuals as the government is able to publish certain information when they find it necessary. The government is exempted from privacy rules regarding national security. HIPAA additionally allows the authorization of [[protected health information]] (PHI) in order to aid in threats to public health and safety as long as it follows the good faith requirement - the idea that disclosing of information is necessary to the benefit of the public.&lt;ref name=":123"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parver|first=Corrine|date=2006|title=“Lessons From Disaster: HIPAA, Medicaid, and Privacy Issues- The Nation's Response to Hurricane Katrina.”|url=|journal=Administrative Law Review|volume=58|pages=651-662|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Model State Emergency Powers Act (MSEHPA) gives the government the power to “suspend regulations, seize property, quarantine individuals and enforce vaccinations” and requires that healthcare providers give information regarding potential health emergencies".&lt;ref name=":123" /&gt;

In regards to [[Hurricane Katrina]], many people in Louisiana relied on Medicaid and their PHI was subsequently affected. People’s medical privacy rights were soon waived in order for patient’s to get the treatment they needed. Yet, many patients were unaware that their rights had been waived.&lt;ref name=":123" /&gt; In order to prevent the sharing of personal information in future natural disasters, a website was created in order to protect people’s medical data.&lt;ref name=":123" /&gt; Ultimately, Katrina showed that the government was unprepared to face a national health scare.

===== Medical data outside of HIPAA =====
Many patients mistakenly believe that HIPAA protects all health information. HIPAA does not usually cover fitness trackers, social media sites and other health data created by the patient. Health information can be disclosed by patients in emails, blogs, chat groups, or social media sites including those dedicated to specific illnesses, "liking" web pages about diseases, completing online health and symptom checkers, and donating to health causes. In addition, credit card payments for physician visit co-pays, purchase of [[Over-the-counter drug|over the counter]] (OTC) medications, home testing products, tobacco products, and visits to alternative practitioners are also not covered by HIPAA.

A 2015 study reported over 165,000 health apps available to consumers. Disease treatment and management account for nearly a quarter of consumer apps. Two-thirds of the apps target fitness and wellness, and ten percent of these apps can [[Personally identifiable information (PII) gathering|collect data]] from a device or sensor. Since the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) only regulates medical devices and most of these applications are not medical devices, they do not require FDA approval. The data from most apps are outside HIPAA regulations because they do not share data with healthcare providers. "Patients may mistakenly assume that mobile apps are under the scope of HIPAA since the same data, such as heart rate, may be collected by an application that is accessible to their physician and covered by HIPAA, or on a mobile app that is not accessible to the physician and not covered by HIPAA.

===== Recent Attempts to improve HIPAA =====
In 2000, there was a new surge to add new regulations to HIPAA.

It included the following goals: to protect individual medical information by providing secure access and control of their own information, improving healthcare quality by creating a more trust between consumers and their healthcare providers and third party organizations, and improve the efficiency of the medical system through new rules and regulations put forth by the local governments, individuals, and organizations.&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woody|first=Robert|date=2002|title="Health Information Privacy: The Rules Get Tougher"|url=|journal=Tort &amp; Insurance Law Journal|volume=37|pages=1051–1076|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation of these new goals was complicated by the change in administrations (Clinton to Bush), so it was difficult for the changes to be successfully implemented.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt; HIPAA, in theory, should apply to all insurance companies, services, and organizations, yet there are exceptions to who actually qualifies under these categories.

Yet, within each category, there are specific restrictions that are different in every category. There are no universal laws that can be easily applied that are easy for organizations can follow. Thus, many states have neglected to implement these new policies. Additionally, there are new patient rights that call for better protection and disclosure of health information. However, like the new rules regarding insurance companies, the enforcement of the legislation is limited and not effective as they are too broad and complex.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt; Therefore, it is difficult for many organizations to ensure the privacy of these people. Enforcing these new requirements also causes companies to spend many resources that they are not willing to use and enforce, which ultimately leads to further problems regarding the invasion of an individual's medical privacy.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt;

==== New Zealand ====
In [[New Zealand]], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20061001112804/http://www.privacy.org.nz/privacy-act/health-information-privacy-code-1994 Health Information Privacy Code (1994)] sets specific rules for agencies in the health sector to better ensure the protection of individual privacy. The code addresses the health information collected, used, held and disclosed by health agencies. For the health sector, the code takes the place of the information privacy principles.

===Netherlands===
The introduction of a nationwide system for the exchange of medical information and access to electronic patient records led to much discussion in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=EPD enquête|url=http://epd-enquete.nl|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112023145/http://epd-enquete.nl/|archive-date=2016-01-12|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Privacy for research participants==
{{Main article|Privacy for research participants}}
In the course of having or being part of a medical practice, doctors may obtain information that they wish to share with the medical or research community. If this information is shared or published, the privacy of the patients must be respected. Likewise, participants in [[medical research]] that are outside the realm of direct patient care have a right to privacy as well.

{{Populism sidebar}}
The '''Narodniks''' ({{lang-ru|народники}}, {{IPA-ru|nɐˈrodʲnʲɪkʲɪ|pron}}) were a politically conscious movement of the [[Russia]]n middle class in the 1860s and 1870s, some of whom became involved in revolutionary agitation against [[tsarism]]. Their ideology was known as ''Narodnichestvo'' ({{lang|ru|народничество}}), from the Russian народ, ''narod'', "people, folk", so it is sometimes translated as "peopleism" or, more commonly, "[[populism]]". A common slogan among the Narodniks was "{{lang|ru|хождение в народ}}" (''khozhdeniye v narod''), meaning "going to the people".&lt;ref&gt;B. S. Itenberg, "[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/sie/19413/ХОЖДЕНИЕ Khozhdenie v narod]'', in ''Sovetskaia istoricheskaia entsiklopediya'' (Moscow: 1973–1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Though their movement achieved little in its own time, the Narodniks were in many ways the intellectual and political forebears of the [[socialist]] revolutionaries who went on to greatly influence Russian history in the 20th century.

==History==
The Narodnik position was mostly held by intellectuals who read the works of [[Alexander Herzen]] (1812–1870) and of [[Nikolay Gavrilovich Chernyshevsky]] (1828–1889), whose convictions were refined by [[Nikolay Mikhaylovsky]] (1842–1904). In the late 19th century, [[socialism]] and [[capitalism]] were slowly becoming the primary theories of Russian political thought, and Mikhaylovsky, realizing this shift in thought, began to tweak his original ideas of Narodnism, such that two groups of Narodniks emerged: the so-called "Critical Narodniks" and "Doctrinaire Narodniks". Critical Narodniks followed Mikhaylovsky, and assumed a very flexible stance on capitalism, whilst adhering to their basic orientation. The more well-known Doctrinaire Narodniks had a firm belief that capitalism had no future in Russia or in any [[agrarian country]].

Narodnism arose after the [[emancipation reform of 1861|emancipation of the serfs]] in 1861 under Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], which signalled the end of [[feudalism]] in Russia. Arguing that freed serfs were being sold into [[wage slavery]], in which the [[bourgeoisie]] had replaced [[landowner]]s, Narodnism aimed to become a political force opposed to the phenomenon. Narodniks viewed aspects of the past with [[nostalgia]]: although they resented the former land ownership system, they opposed the uprooting of [[peasant]]s from the traditional ''[[obshchina]]'' system of [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]]s.

Narodniks focused upon the growing conflict between the peasantry and the so-called ''[[kulaks]]'' (more prosperous landowning farmers). The groups which formed shared the common general aims of destroying the [[Russian Empire|Russian monarchy]] and the ''kulaks'', and of distributing land fairly among the peasantry. The Narodniks generally believed that it was possible to forgo the capitalist phase of Russia's development and proceed directly to [[socialism]].

The Narodniks saw the peasantry as the [[Working class|revolutionary class]] that would overthrow the monarchy, and perceived the village commune as the embryo of socialism. However, they also believed that the peasantry would not achieve revolution on their own, insisting instead that history could only be made by [[Great man theory|outstanding personalities]], who would lead an otherwise passive peasantry to revolution. Vasily Vorontsov called for the Russian [[intelligentsia]] to "bestir itself from the mental lethargy into which, in contrast to the sensitive and lively years of the seventies, it had fallen and formulate a scientific theory of Russian economic development".&lt;ref&gt;
Von Laue, Theodore H. "The Fate of Capitalism in Russia: The Narodnik Version". ''American Slavic and Easy European Review'' 13, no. 1 (1954): 11–28.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Narodnik intellectuals called for an immediate revolution that went beyond philosophical and political discussion.
 
In the spring of 1874, the Narodnik intelligentsia left the cities for the villages, "going to the people" in an attempt to teach the peasantry their [[moral imperative]] to revolt. They found almost no support. Given the Narodniks' generally [[Middle class|middle-]] and [[upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] social background, they found difficulty relating to the impoverished peasants and their culture. They spent much of their time learning peasant customs, such as clothing and dancing. Narodniks were viewed with suspicion by many Russian peasants, who were completely removed from the more [[Modernization|modernized]] culture of the urban sphere. The authorities responded to the Narodniks' attempt with repression: revolutionaries and their peasant sympathizers were imprisoned and exiled.

[[File:Arrest of a Propagandist.jpg|250 px|thumb|''Arrest of a Propagandist'' (1892) by [[Ilya Repin]].]]

One response to this repression was the formation of Russia's first organized revolutionary party, ''[[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]]'' ("People's Will"), in June 1879. It favoured [[secret society]]-led [[terrorism]], justified “as a means of exerting pressure on the government for reform, as the spark that would ignite a vast peasant uprising, and as the inevitable response to the regime's use of violence against the revolutionaries”.&lt;ref name=Pearl&gt;
Pearl, Deborah. “The People’s Will”. ''Encyclopedia of Russian History''. Ed.: James R. Millar (2003). Tomson Gale. p.1162–1163.
&lt;/ref&gt; The attempt to get the peasantry to overthrow the Tsar proved unsuccessful, due to the peasantry's idolisation of the latter as someone "on their side". Narodism therefore developed the practice of terrorism: the peasantry, they believed, had to be shown that the Tsar was not [[supernatural]], and could be killed. This theory, called "direct struggle", intended "uninterrupted demonstration of the possibility of struggling against the government, in this manner lifting the revolutionary spirit of the people and its faith in the success of the cause, and organising those capable of fighting".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]]'' program of 1879.&lt;/ref&gt; On March&amp;nbsp;1, 1881, they succeeded in [[Alexander_II_of_Russia#Assassination|assassinating Alexander II]]. This act backfired on a political level, because the peasantry were generally horrified by the murder, and the government had many Narodnaya Volya leaders hanged, leaving the group unorganized and ineffective.&lt;ref name=Pearl/&gt;

However, these events did not mark the end of the movement, and the later [[Socialist-Revolutionaries]], [[Popular Socialists]], and [[Trudoviks]] all pursued similar ideas and tactics to the Narodniks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/ ''Glossary of Terms and Organisations'']. [[Marxists.org]]. Retrieved 21 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy and actions of the Narodniks therefore helped prepare the way for the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|Russian revolutions of 1905]] and [[Russian Revolution (1917)|1917]].

==Failure==
The Narodnik movement was a populist initiative to engage the rural classes of Russia in a political debate that would overthrow the [[Tsar]]’s government in the nineteenth century. Unlike the [[French Revolution]] or the [[European Revolutions of 1848]], the “to the people” movement was political activism primarily from wealthier individuals. These individuals were generally anti-capitalist, and they believed that they could facilitate both an economic and a political revolution amongst rural Russians by “going to” and educating the peasant classes. The Narodniks during in the 1870s failed to initiate a peasant revolution against the Russian autocracy because (1) they manufactured an idealized image of the peasant classes that was not reflected in reality, (2) there was a lack of unity within the movement, (3) the peasants could not economically or intellectually relate to the Narodniks and (4) the government repressed the movement.

The concept of the narod, like the [[Volk (German word)|volk]] in [[Germany]], was an attempt to establish a new national identity in Russia that was both nationalistic and liberal. [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] said that “none of us like the narod as they actually are, but only as each of us has imagined them.” Russian political activists and government officials often claimed to be working to improve the lives of Russian peasants; in reality, they were manipulating the image of the peasant to further their own political objectives. Narodniks saw the peasant commune as a Russia that had not been tainted by western influence; [[Alexander Herzen]] wrote that the narod was “the official Russia; the real Russia.”&lt;ref&gt;Frierson, Cathy A. Peasant Icons: Representations of Rural People in Late 19th Century Russia. New York, New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  By having a biased understanding of the peasantry, the Narodniks struggled to relate to the peasantry. A populist desire to think only the best of the narod led to unbound faith in the Narodnik system of propagandizing; that faith led to naivety and ultimately failure.

Idealizing the narod caused the Narodniks to make mistakes with how they approached rural Russians. Rural Russians were typically highly devoted to the Tsar and to the [[Orthodox Church]]; not understanding this, the Narodnik rhetoric blamed the Tsar and centralized religion for the peasants’ lack of land and material resources.&lt;ref&gt;Field, Daniel. Peasants and Propagandists in the Russian Movement to the People in 1874. London, U.K.: Garland Publishing Company, 1992. 157-180.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example of the cultural disconnect between the intelligentsia and the peasants in the “to the people” movement was the Narodniks propagandizing through pamphlets when virtually all poor Russians were illiterate.&lt;ref&gt;Venturi, Franco. "Chaikovskists and Movement "To Go To The People." In Roots of Revolution. London. Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1960. 62-70.&lt;/ref&gt;  In essence, the Narodnik movement in 1874 failed because they approached the peasants as though the peasants were intellectuals like themselves. Radicals in the latter part of the 1870s would learn that their concept of the narod was flawed, and intellectuals would have to instead make themselves into peasants to have success in the movement and begin a revolution against the government of Alexander II.&lt;ref&gt;Wortman, Richard. "The City and the Countryside." In The Crisis of Russian Populism. London: Cambridge U.P., 1967. 87-111.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]]’s “anthropological principle” held that all humans, regardless of class, have many intrinsic similarities, and intellectuals saw in the peasants a purified version of themselves that could be radicalized; time demonstrated that this was simply not the case.&lt;ref&gt;Wortman, City and Countryside, 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second cause of Narodnik failure—disunity—is best demonstrated by the split in the movement between Bakunists and Lavrists. The former believed revolution among the peasantry and populist uprisings in Russia would begin in the immediate future, the latter believed that propaganda should precede revolution, and the process would be more gradual.&lt;ref&gt;Pedler, Anne, The Slavonic Review, Vol. 6, No. 16 (Jun., 1927), pp. 130-141 Published by: the Modern Humanities Research Association and University College London, School of Slavonic and East European Studies&lt;/ref&gt;  Bakunists believed that the peasants were ready to revolt with little propagandizing, whereas the Lavrists thought that considerable effort would be needed for the uprisings to begin. A lack of ideological unity resulted in varied approaches to the movement, and because of this the Narodniks no longer presented a united front to rural Russia. Some Narodniks believed in propagandizing by staying in one area for an extended period of time and assimilating into a commune that they were trying to revolutionize (“settled” propaganda), and others practiced propagandizing by using pamphlets and literature to maximize the number of people that the message reached (“flying” propaganda). Both methods had their weaknesses; settled propaganda fostered mistrust because of cultural and religious differences between the intellectuals and the peasants, while flying propaganda simply lacked depth.&lt;ref name="Pedler, Slavonic Review, 130-141"&gt;Pedler, Slavonic Review, 130-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disunity was prevalent even though Narodniks only traveled in three directions: either towards [[Volga River|Volga]], [[Dnieper]], or [[Don River (Russia)|Don]].&lt;ref name="Pedler, Slavonic Review, 130-141"/&gt;  Many Narodniks felt extremely lonely among the peasantry—they longed for their lives in the cities and for the company of other intellectuals. These longings weakened the motivation of many Narodniks and removed much optimism from the movement. Most important, however, was the failure of the Narodniks to present a unified message when going “to the people.” All Narodniks resented foreign intervention into Russia, wanted Russian communes to control their own economic policies, and believed that the emancipation of serfs in 1861 caused peasants to become further impoverished. A lack of unity inhibited these messages.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore H. von Laue American Slavic and East European Review, Vol. 13, No. 1 (Feb., 1954), pp. 11-28&lt;/ref&gt;  Narodniks believed that the Tsar had crippled the peasants, but Narodniks should have understood how highly the peasants regarded the Tsar. They believed that like them, they were a victim of the Russian bureaucrat. By failing to present a disciplined message and avoid directly attacking the Tsar, the Narodnik message was often simply ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Siljak, Ana. The "Girl Assassin." In Angel of Vengeance: The Girl Who Shot the Governor of St. Petersburg and Sparked the Age of Assassination. New York: Griffin ; 2010. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not until the formation of Narodnaya Volya in 1879 that young revolutionaries saw the need for organization and a disciplined message.&lt;ref&gt;Thaden, Edward C. Russia since 1801: the making of a new society. New York: Wiley-Interscience, 1971. 335-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

This lack of unity is responsible for the third reason that the “going to the people movement” failed; the peasants did not receive the intellectuals well. The reception that the [[intelligentsia]] received in the communes was so poor that it destroyed their idealized image of the peasant that was so common prior to 1874. The Narodniks saw peasants as a unified body; they thought that all peasants dressed poorly, so intellectuals dressed as poorly as was possible in order to fit in. In actuality, the peasants saw a poorly dressed person as a person with no authority or credibility. Accordingly, intellectuals dressing as they imagined the peasant dressed had an adverse effect; it actually made peasants suspicious of the intellectuals. Furthermore, Narodnik propaganda failed to address the more mundane, ordinary concerns of the peasantry. The everyday troubles of a rural Russian—a lack of material goods, poor healthcare, etc.—left  little time for discussions of [[socialism]] or [[Egotism|egoism]].&lt;ref&gt;See Frierson, Cathy A. Peasant Icons: Representations of Rural People in Late Nineteenth Century Russia. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminism]] in the Narodnik movement was also hard for the peasantry to accept. Pre-Marxist revolutionaries believed in an unusually strong [[Gender equality|equality of sex]], and educated noblewomen played major roles in radical movements in the latter decades of the nineteenth century. Russian revolutionary literature in the 1840s and 1850s linked the causes of emancipation of [[serfs]] with the emancipation of the Russian woman—this literature was manifest in the Narodnik movement. The Narodniks promulgated Chernyshevskyan ideas of chaste cohabitation—that men and women should live together with no sexual interactions—and gender equality. These concepts were extremely odd to most peasants, and they did not generally react well to them. Furthermore, Narodniks often lived in communes where non-married men and women slept and lived in the same rooms. To Orthodox Russian peasants in the 1870s, such disregard of gender norms were both offensive and off-putting. When you consider the fact that nearly 60% of Narodnik women were from wealthy classes it becomes clear why the Russian peasant could not relate to most intellectuals in the movement intellectually, economically or socially.&lt;ref&gt;Information on sex in the Narodnik movement was drawn from Robert H. McNeal Journal of Social History, Vol. 5, No. 2 (Winter, 1971-1972), pp. 143-163 Published by: Oxford University Press Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3786408&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian Dmitri Pisarev writes that “sensing their inability to act alone, the intelligent radical made the peasantry the instrument to realize their hopes.” The peasants did not readily welcome being a vessel for the revolutionaries. The Narodniks believed that the peasants were the class in Russia most prone to revolution, yet the peasants were not ready for revolutionary action.&lt;ref&gt;See http://s4ss.org/342/remembering-nikolai-tchaikovsky-lessons-from-the-narodniks/&lt;/ref&gt;

Government oppression denied the Narodniki an audience, and this was the final reason that the “going to the people” movement was not successful in beginning a peasant revolution against the autocracy. As historian Daniel Field wrote, “Narodniks found that the peasant desire for land was not accompanied by a wish to rebel.”&lt;ref&gt;See Field, Daniel. Peasants and Propagandists in the Russian Movement to the People in 1874. London, U.K.: Garland Publishing Company, 1992. 423.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Russian government did not look favorably on the Narodniks advocating their overthrow, and peasants would only abide Narodniks so long as no criminal connections could be drawn to them.

Between 1873 and 1877, the Russian police arrested 1,611 propagandists, of whom 15% were women. Radicals in the movement focused on Russia’s oppressive taxation and land laws, and their propaganda was viewed as a threat by Tsar Alexander II. He ordered the arrest and trial of known Narodniks and Narodnik sympathizers in the peasantry; peasants were known to have reported Narodniks to the authorities to escape persecution themselves.  Beginning in 1877, a long and slow trial of 193 Narodniks was conducted. The Narodnik effort to begin a peasant revolution could not be successful when propagandists had to either operate covertly or face imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics on the trials of Narodniks were borrowed from Watson, Hugh. The Russian Empire, 1801-1917. Oxford: Clarendon P., 1967. 205-225.&lt;/ref&gt;

The more the government tried to repress the Narodniks, the more radical the Narodniks became. They grew increasingly selective in their membership, and their Zemlya i Volya (Land and Freedom) members would eventually evolve to form more terroristic organizations: [[Narodnaya Volya]] (The People’s Will) and Chornyperedel (Black Repartition).&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/403562/Narodnik&lt;/ref&gt;  These groups sought to begin a revolution through violence, and when members of Narodnaya Volya killed Tsar Alexander in 1881, the larger Narodnik movement lost virtually all support in the communes and rural parts of Russia. Government oppression further radicalized the Narodniks, and the peasants could not support enhanced radicalization of the already radical intelligentsia.

==Influence==

''Narodnichestvo'' had a direct influence on politics and culture in [[Romania]], through the writings of [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]] and the advocacy of the [[Bessarabia]]n-born [[Constantin Stere]] (who was a member of ''Narodnaya Volya'' in his youth). The latter helped found various groups, included one formed around the [[literary magazine]] ''[[Viața Românească]]'', which he published along with [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]] and Paul Bujor.

Stere and the ''[[Poporanism|Poporanist]]'' (from ''popor'', [[Romanian language|Romanian]] for "people") movement eventually rejected revolution altogether. Nevertheless, he shared the Narodnik view that capitalism was not a necessary stage in the development of an agrarian country. This perspective, which contradicted traditional Marxism, also influenced [[Ion Mihalache]]'s [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]] and its successor, the [[National Peasants' Party]], as well as the philosophy of [[Virgil Madgearu]].

The Marxist historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] detected a Narodnik influence on Bolshevist method. "Lenin’s Bolsheviks owe more than they have sometimes admitted to the experience and methods of work of the Buonarrotist-Narodnik tradition, though Marxist antiritualism has done its best to establish an atmosphere of deliberate and extreme matter-of-factness and colourlessness even in cloak-and-dagger activities which, as their popular name shows, tend to compensate for the extreme tension in which participants are involved by a certain amount of romanticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hobsbawm |first=Eric |title=Primitive Rebels |location=Manchester, U.K. |publisher=University of Manchester Press |year=1959 |isbn=0-7190-0493-4 |page=173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Polesia map - topography.jpg|thumb|right|Polesia (dark green), current borders]]

During and after [[World War II]], the Poleshuks developed a strong sense of identity and currently the ethnic group of Poleshuks is considered one of the distinct cultural and ethnic identities in the area, while most of the population of the Belarusian, Polish and Ukrainian parts of the region of [[Polesie]] have assimilated with the respective nations.&lt;ref name="LSI"/&gt;

At the end of the 1980s, there was a minor campaign in [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Byelorussia]] for the creation of a separate "[[Polesian language]]" based on the dialects of Polesia launched by [[Belarus]]ian [[philologist]] Nikolai Shelyagovich ({{lang-be|Мікола Шаляговіч}}, Mikola Shalyagovich) and his associates. However, they received almost no support and the campaign eventually melted away.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

'''Rail Riders''', originally called '''Great Rail Club'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srpublicity.co.uk/brs/brs19.htm|title=British Railways Publicity|accessdate=16 February 2015|date=20 May 2013|work=Southern Railway Publicity}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a club for young [[rail enthusiast]]s run by [[British Rail]] in the United Kingdom between 1981 and 1991.  Membership entitled children aged 5-15 to discounted rail travel, receipt of a regular quarterly magazine called '''''Rail Riders Express''''' and free entry to the '''Rail Riders World''' [[model railway]] exhibit at [[York railway station]].

The organisation used the slogans ''the happiest club in the land'' and ''travel, action, fun!''  It was promoted by [[Keith Chegwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railforums.co.uk/showthread.php?t=42981&amp;page=2|title=RailRiders|date=18 March 2011|accessdate=16 February 2015|work=RailForums}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Logistics for the club were contracted to '''Trainlines for Britain''' based in [[Wetherby]], West Yorkshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railforums.co.uk/showthread.php?t=28622|title=Rail riders|date=5 December 2009|accessdate=16 February 2015|work=Rail Forums|quote=…Mum actually worked for Rail Riders - everything for it was done by a company called 'Trainlines for Britain' which was based in Wetherby}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During 1981/82 the British Rail Passenger Marketing Services department considered the future promotion of the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C11001912|title=Promotion of the Rail Riders Club for children aged 5-15: includes proposals for future operation|work=AN 185 - British Railways Board: Passenger Marketing Services: Records|publisher=National Archives|date=1 August 1981|issue=PM-MISC-R-002|format=AN 185/85}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The logo was based on a side-profile of the [[British Rail Class 370]] [[Advanced Passenger Train]] (APT), and a [[knitting pattern]] for a pullover with the logo was made by Robin wools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/offer-listing/B00O2EO1P0|title=Knitting Pattern Child's DK Rail Riders Motif Sweater 24-34" To Knit Robin 13374|work=Amazon UK website|accessdate=2 June 2015|author=Robin|quote=Knitting Pattern Leaflet Robin 13374: Instructions To Make Sweater With Rail Riders Motif.

==Mileage competition==
The club ran an annual mileage competition. In 1989, this competition was won by Jonathan Carter, who set a world record of {{convert|125,386|mi|km}} travelled by train in one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=1,650 miles in one day?

==Rail Riders World==
The Rail Riders World model railway was opened by British Rail in April 1984 inside the old tea rooms at [[York railway station]].  It was advertised by British Rail as "Britain's best model railway".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6oFDAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Q1kMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5443%2C6939142|title=Medieval York offers the tourist a grand old time|work=Glasgow Herald|first=Bill|last=McLean|date=25 February 1988|accessdate=2 June 2015|page=23|quote=Another poster enthused about "Britain's Best Model Railway at Rail Riders World in York Station,"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[privatisation of British Rail]] the layout was sold off.  It was subsequently renamed '''York Model Railway'''.

In 2011 the model railway exhibit was moved by its owner William Heron to a new location in [[Hemswell Cliff]] in Lincolnshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/2146198.end_of_line_for_model_railway/|title=End of line for model railway?|work=[[The Press (York)]]|date=26 March 2008|accessdate=16 February 2015|first=Gavin|last=Aitchison}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scunthorpetelegraph.co.uk/County-model-railway/story-11184166-detail/story.html|title=Model Railway heading to Lincolnshire after 27 years at York Station|date=10 January 2011|accessdate=16 February 2015|newspaper=Scunthorpe Telegraph|quote=York Model Railway is making tracks to Lincolnshire after 27 years in its current home.

==Locomotives==

The club sponsored two [[British Rail Class 47|Class 47]] locomotives, one from 1981 to 1988 and another from 1988 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marsden|first=Colin J.|author2=Ford, Darren|title=Encyclopaedia of Modern Traction Names|pages=198|url=http://www.therailwaycentre.com/Nemeplates/Book_PDFs/Names-R.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These were 47406 ''Rail Riders'' and 47488 ''Rail Riders''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwayforum.net/showthread.php?t=8245|title=Rail rider class 47... |work=Railway Forum|date=31 July 2010|access-date=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locomotive 47406 was named by nine-year-old competition winner David Atkins at [[Newcastle railway station|Newcastle Central station]] on 10 December 1981 with an additional full-colour circular plate with the Rail Riders logo added on 12 November 1985 in recognition of increasing membership numbers.&lt;ref name="appleby-47406"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.class47.co.uk/c47_numbers.php?s_loco=47406|title=47 406|date=2 October 2014|access-date=2 June 2015|first=Paul|last=Appleby|work=Class 47 website|quote=Newcastle Central station by David Atkins (aged 9), winner of a Rail Riders competition December 10th 1981 ~ A crest representing the Rail Riders club badge was added on November 12th 1985 to celebrate a 4-fold increase in Rail Riders club membership ~ Plates removed in May 1988.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 1988 the plates were removed in preparation for installation on locomotive 47488, which took place on 9 August 1988 at [[Crewe Diesel TMD]] with the plates removed in August 1992.&lt;ref name="appleby-47406"/&gt;&lt;ref name="appleby-47488"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.class47.co.uk/c47_numbers.php?s_loco=47488|title=47 488|date=2 October 2014|access-date=2 June 2015|first=Paul|last=Appleby|work=Class 47 website|quote=Crewe Diesel TMD without ceremony.

'''Sepia Mutiny''' was a [[blog]] and discussion forum, initially conceived by a group of mostly second generation [[Indian American]] students and young professionals in August 2004. The site had had an exponential growth rate and according to its [[FAQ]], as of May 2007 had amassed over five million readers since inception.&lt;ref name="sepia faq"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sepia Mutiny FAQ|url=http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/faq.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the posts on the site were authored by its founding [[bloggers]], though many posts were also authored by "regular contributors." The site also functioned as a public forum on South Asian issues and boasted a wide range of commenters hailing from diverse geographic locations, although predominantly the [[United States]] and [[England]]. On March 15, 2012, the site announced its closure starting April 1, 2012,&lt;ref name="sepiamutiny.com"/&gt; citing diversified evolution of blogosphere and personal engagements of its writers as reasons for shutting down.

The title is a pun on the [[Sepoy Mutiny]], or [[First War of Indian Independence]] in 1857, a violent widespread movement by [[sepoys]] against the [[British Raj]] during the latter's imperialist rule in India. [[Sepia (color)|Sepia]], a shade of brown, was intended as a [[tongue-in-cheek]] reference to the tone of [[South Asian]] skin.[http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/004614.html]

==Social context==

Sepia Mutiny discussed issues facing first and second generation immigrants from the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The goal of the site was in effect to capture the position of the Indian-American [[diaspora]] as it emigrates to foreign nations and primarily North America.&lt;ref name="sepia faq" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Asian Indian Population in Metropolitan Areas in the US|author=India Network Foundation Incorporated|year=2000|url=http://www.indnet.org/census/metropop.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sepia Mutiny had become a focal point of discussion for [[Desi]]s on the Internet in the United States and, to some extent, other parts of the South Asian diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alternet Mix the Message|author=Ahmed, Tanzila|date=September 9, 2006|url=http://www.alternet.org/wiretap/33078/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sepia Mutiny's emergence was part of the increase in mainstream diasporic Desi writing and creative arts outside the traditional genres — the effects of which can be seen in [[Indian subcontinent]] and spills over to the [[United States|America]], [[Canada]], and the [[United Kingdom]], given the presence of Desis. A similar trend was seen at sites like [[Badmash.org|Badmash]], an online comic that gained notice for its [[Amitabh Bachchan|Amitabh for President]] campaign, South Asian magazines such as [http://www.abcdlady.com ABCDlady], as well as the greater prominence of [[Bollywood]] films in the United States. Crossovers movies such as ''[[Bride and Prejudice]]'', ''[[Bollywood/Hollywood]]'' and ''[[Monsoon Wedding]]'' have helped the western audience understand the desi culture.  The blog also addressed the growing prominence of South Asian Americans like [[Bobby Jindal]], [[Russell Peters]], [[Sanjay Gupta]], [[Neel Kashkari]] and [[Kal Penn]], among others, as they enter the mainstream of American culture.

==South Asians and American politics==

Part of the focus of Sepia Mutiny was to bring attention to the expanding involvement of South Asian Americans as a political body in the United States, especially in the 2004 and 2006 congressional and presidential elections. A lot of attention was given to the controversy surrounding [[Virginia United States Senate election, 2006]], a scandal that erupted due to comments by former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] for [[Virginia]], [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]], in which he used the word [[macaca (term)|macaca]] to refer to [[S.R. Sidarth]], an Indian American aide working for his opponent's Senatorial campaign. Sepia Mutiny also drew attention to other public figures in America who have used racial slurs against Indians in the past such as Vice-President Joe Biden and major radio personalities in [[Philadelphia]] and [[New York City]].

The bloggers at Sepia Mutiny often focused on the emergence of Indian-Americans in the Western political structure. The site served as fertile ground for discussion regarding the actions of these politicians in the United States, ranging from [[Bobby Jindal]] to [[Nikki Haley]] to [[Shahid Malik]].

==Violence against South Asians==

Another focus of the blog had been to highlight violence against South Asians — a phenomenon which has become more common since the September 11 attacks on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asata.org/issue/hateviolence/content Hate violence | Alliance of South Asians Taking Action (ASATA)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410011000/http://www.asata.org/issue/hateviolence/content |date=2007-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site, however, broadened its awareness of violence beyond simple [[hate crimes]]. The recent tragedy at [[Virginia Tech]] was discussed from a South Asian perspective with posts about South Asian shooting victims Professor [[G. V. Loganathan]] and student [[Minal "Minu" Panchal]], victims the mainstream media failed to talk in depth about. They also were one of the few media sources that addressed the recent assault of a young Indian American [[National Lawyer's Guild]] observer Sanjukta Paul during the [[The Los Angeles May Day Mêlée|Los Angeles May Day Mêlée]] at [[MacArthur Park]] by a member of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://accidentalblogger.typepad.com/accidental_blogger/2007/05/may_day_up_clos.html Accidental Blogger: May Day : Up Close and Personal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Police Terror in the Park|author=Leslie Radford|url=http://la.indymedia.org/news/2007/05/197899.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Asian literature, music, and the arts==

In the spring and summer of 2006, a number of Sepia Mutiny posts debated the allegations of [[plagiarism]] in [[Kaavya Viswanathan]]'s novel, ''[[How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life]]''. Posts related to Viswanathan were widely cited by other blogs and the mass-media, including ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-05-01"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/01/business/media/01link.html?_r=1 |title=In Internet Age, Writers Face Frontier Justice |first=Tom |last=Zeller Jr. |work=New York Times |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=May 1, 2006 |accessdate=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Washington Post]]''. The site has also highlighted South Asian authors that have come to attention in the United States and abroad, including [[Booker Prize]] winners [[Salman Rushdie]] and [[Kiran Desai]], and [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novelist [[Jhumpa Lahiri]].

There was considerable discussion about South Asians in the music industry, ranging from recent [[Bollywood]] soundtracks to mainstream Western musicians, such as recent ''[[American Idol]]'' contestant [[Sanjaya Malakar]]. The site also provides coverage of the long history in the music industry of fusing Eastern and Western styles of music, as can be seen through the work of artists like [[Panjabi MC]], [[Raghav]], and [[Talvin Singh]], and unique new niche genres such as [[Desi Ska]] and [[Hindu Rock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/003422.html|title=Going Multi-tone: Desi Ska Music|author=Amardeep Singh|date=May 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition Indian American film and television were highlighted on the blog. Be it mainstream releases to American audiences like [[Harold and Kumar]], [[Salaam Bombay]], and the [[Elements Trilogy]], or lesser known work such as the cult-classic [[American Desi]], Sepia Mutiny bloggers covered it.

==South Asian Americans and the Indian subcontinent==

In addition to being aware of issues faced by South Asians outside of India, Sepia Mutiny was also cognizant of current events within the subcontinent as well. Many posts discuss current events in India, including controversial topics such as [[terrorism]], communal tensions, [[AIDS]], and even the rapid evolution of the [[Bollywood]] film industry. Sepia Mutiny's comprehensive international awareness served to highlight that the changing South Asian culture in the Western world is often mirrored by reciprocal evolution on the Indian subcontinent itself.

From January 14 to February 26, 1926, all grades of the African workers within the Railway Department of the Sierra Leone Government participated in a strike.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This strike represented the first time a trade union in Sierra Leone was effective in politically organizing with a set organizational structure. It is also the first strike and act of political disobedience in which the Krio elite identified with and supported the strikers and the working class against the British colonizing power.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Historical background ==
The financial situation in Sierra Leone in the mid-1920s following [[World War I]] was not dire. While the deficit for 1921 reached £343,171, by 1923, it was at a surplus of £116,926.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wyse|first=Akintola J.G.|year=1981|title=The 1926 Railway Strike and Anglo-Krio Relations: An Interpretation|url=|journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies|volume=14| issue =  1|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high unemployment rate after the war had gradually been reduced, but the wage rates of the majority of government artisan workers, throughout this improving economic situation, had remained stagnant.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conway|first=H.E.|year=1968|title=Labour Protest Activity in Sierra Leone during the Early Part of the Twentieth Century|url=|journal=Labour History|volume=15|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, this engendered a railway strike, where the railway workers tried to build alliances with other government workers and persuaded 2,000 workers of the police force to join them in a strike for higher wages.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=2Wn7BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=Gambian+sailors'+strike+of+1929&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kYkgZyP28o&amp;sig=TAi4f6DnlIFlqdTMbRCF4_Ff3MA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiltOCKy8LRAhUCCpoKHaMjAcAQ6AEILjAG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A History of Pan-African Revolt|last=James|first=Cyril Lionel Robert|last2=James|first2=C.

In order to make the railway more financially profitable, railway rates were increased in 1919 and subsequent years, which did not yield greater profits and raised food prices and those of goods transported via the railway. Thus, the working class conditions, which included the majority of the railway workers, did not improve. In another attempt at improving the financial efficiency of the railway in Sierra Leone, Colonel Hammond, a railway expert, was invited to inspect the Sierra Leone Railway in 1922 and 1924. Following Hammond's second visit, Governor [[Alexander Slater|Alexander Ransford Slater]], approved a proposal by the general manager, G.R. Webb, imposing an efficiency bar examination for African clerks trying to qualify for salary increases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The attempt to introduce the examination was met by protest on the side of the clerks, who criticized the European staff being exempt from the examination and the failure to give Africans generally permanent appointments. This attempt at introducing a discriminatory policy by the government helped to unify middle class, white-collar Creole clerks, who might otherwise not have been such strong voices in the union, and more manual daily-wage laborers in their discontent and subsequent activism in the railway union.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Artisans and clerks, part of the Railway Skilled Artisan Union, had regularly sent petitions to the railway administration. In March 1925, for example, they petitioned the general manager to introduce a grading system, in order to create more jobs and generate greater efficiency. The petitioners were met with contempt and discouragement by the administration, which promptly dismissed key workers for their "inefficiency."

In April 1925, this finally led to the Railway Workers Union being formed "for the improvement of the conditions of all members of the Railway Department." Its members spanned clerks, artisans, and others who joined and adopted the principle of collective responsibility. It was this union, the aligning of clerks and daily-paid workers, who otherwise would advocate separately for their interests, which channeled and articulated the grievances of its members.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On January 12, 1926, at a meeting between the chief mechanical engineer, Malthus, and the president of the Railway Workers Union, the administration insisted on the efficiency bar exams and failed to address the workers' requests outlined in their petitions, which finally resulted in [[A.E. Richards,]] the workers' leader, verbally notifying the administration of the workers' intention to strike.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== The strike ==

=== Union background and workers' involvement ===
On January 14, 1926, the strike officially began and the government, adopting a staunch resistance policy, placed [[Freetown]] under police and military surveillance, prohibiting te sale of intoxicating liquors for specific periods, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the days that followed, starting on January 17, strikers were arrested for acts of violence and other perceived misconducts and on January 18 the railway management began dismissing many strikers from their posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Achola|first=Milcah Amolo|year=1990|title=Labour Metropolitan Capital and the Colonial State: A Case Study of the Labour Policies of the Sierra Leone Development Company, 1930-38|url=|journal=Transafrican Journal of History|volume=19|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the strike, the strikers employed different methods of revolt that included removing the rails in front of the general manager's train, removing the rails on curves or steep banks and at the approach to a bridge, pulling down telegraph poles and cutting wires, inhibiting telegraphic communication with the protectorate and other ways of showing their discontent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Nonetheless, applications to fill the posts of strikers who had been dismissed were opened, dismissals which contributed to a surplus of the already abundantly available labor force in Sierra Leone.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibrahim|first=Abdullah|year=1992|title=Profit versus Social Reproduction: Labor Protests in the Sierra Leonean Iron-Ore Mines, 1933-38|url=|journal=African Studies Review|volume=35| issue =  3|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite government claims about the damage incurred by the railway due to the strike, thirteen telegraphists from the [[Ghana|Gold Coast]], who arrived on January 20, helped maintain communication between Freetown and the rest of the colony, and volunteers maintained goods trains functioning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Governor Slater perceived the strike as a challenge to and revolt against colonial (civil) authority. On January 21, the Executive Council set the terms, which the strikers would have to abide by to return to the railway service: 
# Daily wage workers would receive reduced pay and be expected to work extra hours to compensate for the strike. Those dismissed would not be re-employed. 
# Pensionable staff would also receive reduced pay—their grades and increments were reduced on being accepted—and they would still be required to take the efficiency bar examinations 
# All returnees would be expected to work additional hours to make up for the strike.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
The terms set forth by the Executive Council were communicated to the general manager on January 26, and conveyed to the workers in a meeting on January 27. The government insisted on the terms set out by the Executive Council on January 21, until the end of the strikes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Involvement of the colonized elite ===
In 1926, in contradistinction to the strike in 1919, the Krio [[intelligentsia]], the majority of the municipality, openly supported the workers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This may also have been because, relevant to the dynamics of Anglo-Krio relations, the atmosphere was very racially charged during the time of the 1926 strikes, which underscored the racial division between the African workers and their mostly white industrial employers, more so than in 1919.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At the turn of the century, thinly-veiled racialism evoked by the application of Darwin's evolutionary theory to scientifically establish the superiority of the white races, had solidified racial authority and given rise to particular dynamics between the colonizers and the colonized elite, where the colonizing Europeans did not disguise their contempt for the abilities of educated, though racially "inferior" Africans.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fyfe|first=Christopher|year=1987|title=1787-1887-1987: Reflections on a Sierra Leone Bicentenary|url=|journal=Africa|volume=57|pages=416|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War I, this yielded an increasing number of racially motivated instances of physical violence against Krio citizens which were seemingly condoned by the government;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wyse|first=Akintola J.G.|year=1987|title=The Dissolution of Freetown City Council in 1926: A Negative Example of Political Apprenticeship in Colonial Sierra Leone|url=|journal=Africa|volume=57|pages=423|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the 1926 case of Barber, an African customs officer who was assaulted by an assistant district commissioner, [[A.H. Stocks]], for alleged insolence (an incident also known as the Stocks affair). Other examples of the increasing divide between the Krio elites and the colonial authority include the racial segregation in Freetown due to establishing an exclusive European residential area at Hill Station in 1904 with its own railway.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, the racial discrimination experienced by the Krio elite gradually caused them to identify with the grievances of the working class as common sufferers against the colony from which they benefitted.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Through the more obvious demonstrations of racialism, it also became clearer that the strike was a symptom of the conflict between [[Cultural imperialism|white imperialism]] and nascent [[African nationalism]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The city council on January 15 proposed to discuss strikers' grievances with them, but this was shut down by the colonial secretary [[H.C. Luke]] on behalf of Slater, because giving the City Council permission to intervene would have legitimized the grievances of the strikers. Local newspapers, such as the Sierra Leone Weekly News and other publications, published editorials on the chronology of the strike and criticizing the governmental violent attempts to intimidate the workers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On January 21, a meeting of ratepayers and citizens took place at Wilberforce Memorial Hall and was chaired by the deputy mayor, the veteran politician [[J.A. Songo-Davies]]. At the meeting a committee of ten Africans and five Europeans was set up to negotiate terms with the government to end the strike. Another committee of seven citizens, including two Europeans, and seven workers' representatives was set up to meet and negotiate with the manager of the railway. Governor Slater was informed of these resolutions, but on February 15 he rejected the workers' counter-proposal to have the secretary of state establish a Commission of Enquiry and return working conditions to the status quo ante.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Given that the government held the monopoly of coercive forces, neither the strikers nor the elite had any leverage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Nonetheless, the elite via the press, and public organizations, exhausted the options available to them—such as setting up a Strike Relief Fund at a "Support the Strike Meeting" on February 8, 1926—to support the workers' demands and show solidarity with their strike. By the end of March, the Strike Relief Fund had supported the strikers with nearly £500 of donations, from the [[Sierra Leone Friendly Society]] in [[Lagos]], [[Nigerians|Nigerian]] allies; Sierra Leoneans residing in [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Sekondi]]; Gold Coast and Creoles in [[Kumasi]]; as well as Sierra Leoneans in [[Monrovia]], among others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the end, the Strike Relief Fund came too late to sustain the strike, especially given the real material needs of the workers on strike.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== End of the strike ===
On February 26, after six weeks of strike, the workers returned to work, forced to accept the government's terms. Less than a dozen people were arrested. Of the 200 people dismissed during the strike, 37 were pensionable workers, some with over twenty years' worth of experience, and twenty daily wagers were dismissed from the railway. The Secretary of the Railway Workers' Union, President of the Bo branch, and other Protectorate workers, were also dismissed. The President of the union was demoted and reassigned, and ended up resigning from the department. The job vacancies were filled with West Indian and local workers. Three months after the strike ended, all worker-paid daily wages were returned to their previous incremental rates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After the end of the strike, the union suffered from a lack of  leadership and was replaced by a government-approved Railway Staff Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=JGpaUuhxAf4C&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=sierra+leone+1926+railway+strike&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PgjmSFs8Rg&amp;sig=wWHIYh-_UCTN7wmgPKx2P6XORrc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ6fyhm8TRAhXBwxQKHRi9CxMQ6AEIOjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=sierra%20leone%201926%20railway%20strike&amp;f=false|title=Colonialism, Class Formation, and Underdevelopment in Sierra Leone|last=Mukonoweshuro|first=Eliphas G.|date=1993-01-01|publisher=University Press of America|year=|isbn=9780819182838|location=|pages=112|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the strike was a capitulation to superior forces, but this was one of the first instances of defiance and protest against the British in Sierra Leone, which presented a major challenge to the colonial government.

== Political consequences ==
As a consequence of their support for the strikes, the elites, especially those serving in political functions, such as Dr. [[Herbert Bankole-Bright|H.C Bankole-Bright]] and [[Ernest Beoku-Betts|E.S. Beoku-Betts]], who served as the first elected African members in the Legislative Council,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; received severe backlash.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These hostile relations only served to galvanize the intelligentsia and the workers in an act of national resistance. This led to the government cracking down on the African elected members of various councils in the following ways: 
# Because the Krio elite had supported the strikers, after the end of the strike, the colonial government considered suspending the 1924 constitution, with which Africans had been able to gain representative power, since a number of Africans were elected to the Legislative Council.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
# The city council, an important political organ for aspiring Krio politicians, was dissolved in December 1926 in a political act expressing unbridled British discontent with the Krio elite;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; prior attempts to dissolve the city council had been blocked by the secretary of state for the colonies. Since the city council was a largely African-controlled political apparatus, its members served both on the Legislative and the city council, the colonial government perceived its political sway in favor of strikers as threatening.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; From then on, for the next twenty-two years, the municipality was directly administered by the colonial government.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
# In a further backlash against educated Africans, African civil servants were condemned for their part in defiance of the colonial authority and discriminated against, with the promotion of Africans, declining noticeably after 1926.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
In the end, according to academics such as [[Martin Kilson]], this institutionally violent and repressive response of the government to the strikers, brought them, and the urban masses, into direct contact with its coercive power, providing an important insight to the workers, in their attempt at civil disobedience, into the role of force in maintaining colonial authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Change in a West African State|last=Kilson|first=Martin|publisher=Atheneum Press|year=1969|isbn=|location=New York|pages=106|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Labor unions in Sierra Leone ==
With the 1926 railway strike, the Railway Union set a strong precedent for political action and civil disobedience; the railways and mines became the focus for unionization, political organization and strike action.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stirling|first=John|year=2011|title=Trade unions in a fragile state: the case of Sierra Leone|url=|journal=Industrial Relations Journal|volume=42|pages=236–253|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this are the 1935 and 1938 strikes by workers at the then newly opened [[Sierra Leone Development Company]] (DELCO), mining iron ore at [[Marampa]]. Inspired by 1926 railway workers' strike against the unjust practices of the European industrial employers, they went on strike for better working conditions and compensation.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/844041468302424273/pdf/834250WP0Polit0Box0382086B00PUBLIC0.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Unions, such as the carpenter or shipwright union subsequently also arose around artisanal trades.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This broad structure of trade unions, in addition to public sector workers, still exists and twenty-six organizations constitute the [[Sierra Leone Labour Congress]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Social peer-to-peer processes''' are interactions with a [[peer-to-peer]] dynamic. These peers can be humans or computers. Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a term that originated from the popular concept of the P2P distributed computer application architecture which partitions tasks or workloads between peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What does Peer-to-Peer Architecture (P2P Architecture) mean?|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/454/peer-to-peer-architecture-p2p-architecture|publisher=Techopedia Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}} This application structure was popularized by [[file sharing]] systems like [[Napster]], the first of its kind in the late 1990s.

The concept has inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction. P2P human dynamic affords a critical look at current [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[centralization|centralized]] social structures. Peer-to-peer is also a political and social program for those who believe that in many cases, peer-to-peer modes are a preferable option.

== Definition ==
P2P is a specific form of relational dynamic, based on the assumed [[equipotent|equipotency]] of its participants, organized through the free cooperation of equals in view of the performance of a common task, for the creation of a common good, with forms of decision making and autonomy that are widely distributed throughout the network.

There are several fundamental aspects of social P2P processes:
* [[peer production]] - the collaborative production of use value is open to participation and use to the widest possible number (as defined by [[Yochai Benkler]], in his essay Coase's Penguin);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.yale.edu/yalelj/112/BenklerWEB.pdf | title = Coase's Penguin, or, Linux and The Nature of the Firm | first = Yochai | last = Benkler | publisher = The Yale Law Journal | format = PDF | date =  | accessdate = 2010-04-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101010152105/http://www.yale.edu/yalelj/112/BenklerWEB.pdf | archivedate = 2010-10-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* peer governance - production or project is governed by the community of producers themselves, not by market allocation or corporate hierarchy;
* peer property - the use-value of property is freely accessible on a universal basis; peer services and products are distributed through new modes of property, which are not exclusive, though recognize individual authorship (i.e. the [[GNU General Public License]] or the [[Creative Commons]] licenses).

Peer production does not produce commodities for exchange value, and does not use the [[price mechanism]] or [[corporate]] [[hierarchy]] to determine the allocation of resources. It must therefore be distinguished from both the [[capitalist]] [[Market (economics)|market]] (though it can be linked and embedded in the broader market) and from production through state and corporate planning; as a mode of [[governance]] it differs from traditional [[linear]] hierarchies; and as a mode of property it differs from both traditional private property and state-based collective [[public property]]; it is rather the common property of its producers and users and the whole of humankind. Unlike [[private property]], peer property is inclusive rather than exclusive — its nature is to share ownership as widely, rather than as narrowly, as possible.

== Characteristics ==
P2P processes are not structureless, but are characterized by dynamic and changing structures which adapt themselves to phase changes. Its rules are not derived from an external authority, as in hierarchical systems, but are generated from within. It does not deny ‘authority’, but only fixed forced hierarchy, and therefore accepts authority based on expertise, initiation of the project, etc. P2P may be the first true [[meritocracy]]{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. P2P eliminates most, if not all, barriers to entry. The threshold for participation is kept as low as possible. Equipotency means that there is no prior formal filtering for participation, but rather that it is the immediate practice of cooperation which determines the expertise and level of participation. Communication is not top-down and based on strictly defined reporting rules, but feedback is systemic, integrated in the protocol of the cooperative system. Techniques of 'participation capture' and other social accounting make automatic cooperation the default scheme of the project. Personal identity becomes partly generated by the contribution to the common project. P2P characterists have been studied by [[Howard Rheingold]] ''et al.'''s Cooperation Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rheingold.com/cooperation/CooperationProject_3_30_05.pdf |title=The Cooperation Project: Objectives, Accomplishments, Proposals |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

P2P is a network, not a linear or 'pyramidal' hierarchy (though it may have elements of it); it is 'distributed', though it may have elements of [[centralization]] and 'decentralisation'; intelligence is not located at any center, but everywhere within the system. Assumed equipotency means that P2P systems start from the premise that ‘it doesn’t know where the needed resource will be located’, it assumes that ‘everybody’ can cooperate, and does not use formal rules in advance to determine its participating members. Participants are expected to self-select the module that corresponds best to their expertise. Equipotency, i.e. the capacity to cooperate, is verified in the process of cooperation itself. [[Data validation|Validation]] of knowledge, acceptance of processes, are determined by the collective through the use of digital rules which are embedded in the project's basic protocol. Cooperation must be free, not forced, and not based on neutrality (i.e. the buying of cooperation in a monetary system). It exists to produce something. It enables the widest possible participation. These are a number of characteristics that we can use to describe P2P systems ‘in general’, and in particular as it emerges in the human lifeworld. Whereas participants in hierarchical systems are subject to the panoptism of the select few who control the vast majority, in P2P systems, participants have access to holoptism, the ability for any participant to see the whole.

== Infrastructure ==
The first requirement to facilitate the emergence of peer-to-peer processes is the existence of a technological infrastructure that enables distributed access to fixed capital. Individual computers that enable a universal machine capable of executing any logical task are a form of distributed fixed capital, available at low cost to many producers. The internet, as a point to point network, was specifically designed for participation by the edges (computer users) without the use of obligatory hubs. Although it is not fully in the hands of its participants, the internet is controlled through distributed governance, and outside the complete hegemony of particular private or state actors. The Internet's hierarchical elements, such as the stacked [[IP protocol]]s and [[Domain Name System]], do not deter participation. Viral communicators, or meshworks, are a logical extension of the internet. With this methodology, devices create their own networks through the use of excess capacity, bypassing the need for a pre-existing infrastructure. [[Wireless community network]]s, Open Spectrum advocacy, file-serving television, and alternative meshwork-based telecommunication infrastructures are exemplary of this trend.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"&gt;{{cite news  |url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=499
  |title=The Political Economy of Peer Production
  |date=2005-01-12
  |author=
  |publisher=CTheory
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second requirement is alternative information and communication systems which allow for [[autonomous]] communication between cooperating agents. The web (in particular the Writeable Web and the [[Web 2.0]] that is in the process of being established) allows for the universal autonomous production, dissemination, and 'consumption' of written material while the associated [[podcasting]] and [[webcasting]] developments create an 'alternative information and communication infrastructure' for audio and audiovisual creation. The existence of such an infrastructure enables autonomous content production that may be distributed without the intermediary of the classic publishing and broadcasting media (though new forms of mediation may arise).&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

The third requirement is the existence of a 'software' infrastructure for autonomous global cooperation. A growing number of collaborative tools, such as blogs and wikis, embedded in [[social networking]] software facilitate the creation of trust and [[social capital]], making it possible to create global groups that can create [[use-value]] without the intermediary of manufacturing or distribution by for-profit [[Business|enterprises]].&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

The fourth requirement is a legal infrastructure that enables the creation of use-value and protects it from private [[appropriation (economics)|appropriation]]. The [[General Public License]] (which prohibits the appropriation of software code), the related [[Open Source Initiative]], and certain versions of the [[Creative Commons]] license fulfill this role. They enable the protection of common use-value and use viral characteristics to spread. [[GPL]] and related material can only be used in projects that in turn put their adapted source code in the [[public domain]].&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

The fifth requirement is cultural. The diffusion of mass intellectuality, (i.e. the distribution of human intelligence) and associated changes in ways of feeling and being ([[ontology]]), ways of knowing ([[epistemology]]) and value constellations ([[axiology]]) have been instrumental in creating the type of cooperative individualism needed to sustain an [[ethos]] which can enable P2P projects.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

== In the economy ==

=== Capitalism ===
There are two important aspects to the emergence of P2P in the economic sphere. On the one hand, as format for peer production processes, it is emerging as a 'third mode of production' based on the cooperation of autonomous agents. Indeed, if the first mode of production was [[laissez-faire]] based [[capitalism]], and the second mode was the model of a [[Central planning|centrally-planned]] economy, then the third mode is defined neither by the motor of profit, nor by central planning: to allocate resources and make decisions, it does not use market and pricing mechanisms, or managerial commands, but instead uses [[social relations]]. Peer production is a significant part of the [[mainstream]] economy, even if it is not much advertised as such in mainstream economic literature.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

Despite significant differences, P2P and the capitalist market are highly interconnected. P2P is dependent on the market and the market is dependent on P2P. Peer production produces [[use-value]] through mostly [[Intellectual capital|immaterial]] production, without directly providing an income for its producers. Participants cannot live from peer production, though they derive meaning and value from it.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

The market and capitalism are also dependent on P2P. Capitalism has become a system relying on distributed networks, in particular on the P2P infrastructure in computing and communication. Productivity is highly reliant on cooperative [[teamwork]], most often organized in ways that are derivative of peer production's governance. The support given by major IT companies to [[open-source software development|open-source development]] is a testimony to the use derived from even the new common property regimes. The general [[business model]] seems to be that businesses use the P2P [[infrastructure]], and create a surplus value through services, which can be packaged for [[exchange value]]. For-profit enterprises mostly use partial implementations of P2P. [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] built itself around user reviews,{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} [[eBay]] lives on a platform of worldwide distributed auctions, and [[Google]] is constituted by [[user-generated]] content. Value creation today is no longer confined to the enterprise, but beholden to the mass intellectuality of [[knowledge worker]]s, who through their lifelong learning/experiencing and systemic connectivity, constantly innovate within and without the enterprise.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt; Yet more recently, in the last decade, peer-to-peer exchanges have become even more prevalent in the so-called "[[sharing economy]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The rise of the sharing economy|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21573104-internet-everything-hire-rise-sharing-economy|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also termed an "access economy" or a "peer exchange economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Popularity of Peer-to-Peer Exchanges in the Last Decade|url=http://www.gearpeers.com/blog/the-popularity-of-peer-to-peer-exchanges-in-the-last-decade/|publisher=Gear Peers|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, businesses such as [[Uber]], [[Lyft]], and [[Airbnb]] are all based on peer-to-peer physical exchanges. This sharing economy is projected by some analysts to encompass $335 billion by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Car Sharing Economy|url=http://www.drivemycar.com.au/Long-term-rental-in-the-car-sharing-economy|publisher=DriveMyCar|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zhuo|first1=TX|title=Airbnb and Uber Are Just the Beginning. What's Next for the Sharing Economy.|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/244192|publisher=Entrepreneur|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer-to-peer systems contribute to more specific forms of distributed capitalism. The massive use of [[open source software]] in business, enthusiastically supported by [[venture capital]] and large IT companies such as [[IBM]], is creating a distributed software platform that will drastically undercut the [[monopolistic]] rents enjoyed by companies such as [[Microsoft]] and [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], while [[Skype]] and [[VoIP]] will drastically redistribute the [[Telecommunications service provider|telecom]] infrastructure. In addition, it also points to a new business model that is 'beyond' products, focusing instead on services associated with the nominally free FS/OS software model. Industries are gradually transforming themselves to incorporate user-generated innovation, and a new intermediation may occur around user-generated media. Many knowledge workers are choosing non-corporate paths and becoming mini-entrepreneurs, relying on an increasingly sophisticated participatory infrastructure, a kind of digital corporate commons.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

=== Market economy ===
Social P2P systems are different from [[market economy]]:&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt; neither market pricing nor managerial command are required for P2P processes to make decisions regarding the allocation of [[resources]]. There are further differences:

* Market economy is similar to insect-like [[swarm intelligence]]. There are autonomous agents in a distributed environment, but each individual only sees his own immediate benefit.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;
* Markets are based on 'neutral' cooperation, and not on [[synergistic]] cooperation: no [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]] is created.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;
* Markets operate on the production and exchange of value to generate [[Profit (economics)|profit]], not [[production for use]].
* Whereas P2P aims at full participation, markets only fulfill the needs of those with [[purchasing power]].

Markets do not function well for common needs that do not involve direct payment&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt; ([[national security|national defense]], general policing, [[education]] and [[public health]]). In addition, they fail to take into account [[negative externalities]]&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt; (the environment, social costs, future generations).

=== P2P economic system ===
In ''The Political Economy of Peer Production'' Bauwens regards P2P phenomena as an emerging alternative to capitalist society. P2P economy may be seen as extending or already existing outside the sphere of free/open source software production and other non-rival immaterial goods. Peer production effectively enables the free cooperation of producers, who have access to their own means of [[Production (economics)|production]], and the resulting use-value of the projects supersedes for-profit alternatives.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

Historically, though forces of higher [[productivity]] may be temporarily embedded in the old productive system, they ultimately lead to deep upheavals and reconstitutions of the [[political economy]]. The emergence of capitalist modes within the [[feudal system]] is a case in point. This is particularly significant because leading sectors of the for-profit economy are deliberately slowing down productive growth (through patents and [[Monopoly|monopolization]]) and trying to outlaw P2P production and sharing practices.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

== In politics ==

=== Governance ===
[[Government]]s of countries are composed of a specialized and privileged body of individuals, who [[monopolize]] political decision-making. Their function is to enforce existing laws, [[legislate]] new ones, and arbitrate conflicts via their monopoly on violence. Legislation can be open to the general [[citizenry]] through [[open source governance]], allowing policy development to benefit from the collected wisdom of the people as a whole.

[[Michel Bauwens]] has stated, that society is not a peer group with an [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] [[consensus]], but rather a [[decentralized]] structure of competing groups and [[representative democracy]] cannot be replaced entirely by peer governance.&lt;ref name="Re-public"&gt;{{cite news

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer projects which evolve beyond a certain scale and start facing issues of decisions about scarce [[resources]], will probably adapt some representational mechanisms. Representative and [[bureaucratic]] [[decision-making]] can and will in some places be replaced by global governance networks which may be self-governed to a large extent, but in any case, it will and should incorporate more and more [[Multistakeholder Model]]s (i.e. [[collaborative e-democracy]]), which strives to include all groups that could be affected. This group-based partnership model is different, but related in spirit, to the individual-based peer governance, because they share an [[ethos]] of participation.&lt;ref name="Re-public"/&gt;

=== Open source movements ===
Many new movements are taking on P2P organizational formats, such as the [[alter-globalization]] movement and the [["Occupy" protests|"Occupy"]] movement (i.e. [[Occupy Wall Street]]). The movements see itself as a network of networks that combines players from a wide variety of fields and opinion, who, despite the fact that they do not see eye to eye in all things, manage to unite around a common [[Computing platform|platform]] of action around certain key events.

They are able to mobilize vast numbers of people from every [[continent]], without having at their disposal any of the traditional [[news media]], such as television, radio or newspapers. Rather, they rely almost exclusively on the P2P technologies described above. Thus, Internet media are used for communication and learning on a continuous basis, prior to the mobilizations, and also during the mobilizations.

Independent Internet media platforms such as [[Indymedia]], as well as the skillful use of mobile phones, are used for real-time response management, undertaken by small groups that use buddy-list technologies, and sometimes open source programs that have been explicitly designed for political activism such as TextMob.

Many reports have appeared, including those described in Howard Rheingold's [[Smart Mob]]s, about the political significance of [[SMS]] in organizing successful protests and ‘democratic revolutions’. The network model allows for a more fluid organization that does not fix any group in a permanent adversarial position. Various temporary coalitions are created on an [[ad hoc]] basis depending on the issues.

'''Social science fiction''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[science fiction]], usually (but not necessarily) [[soft science fiction]], concerned less with [[technology in science fiction|technology]]/[[space opera]] and more with speculation about society. In other words, it "absorbs and discusses anthropology" and speculates about human behavior and interactions.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;"[http://archaeology.about.com/od/fictionstoriesandnovels/Archaeology_in_Fiction_Stories_and_Novels.htm Archaeology in Fiction, Stories, and Novels]". [[about.com]]. May 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploration of fictional societies is a significant aspect of science fiction, allowing it to perform predictive (''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895); ''[[The Final Circle of Paradise]]'', 1965) and precautionary (''[[Brave New World]]'', 1932; ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', 1949; ''[[Childhood's End]]'',  ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', 1953) functions, to criticize the contemporary world (''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', 1726; the [[Alexander Gromov|works of Alexander Gromov]], 1995 - Present) and to present solutions (''[[Walden Two]]'', ''[[Freedom™]]''), to portray alternative societies (''[[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky#Noon Universe|World of the Noon]]'') and to examine the implications of ethical principles, as for example in the [[Sergei Lukyanenko bibliography|works]] of [[Sergei Lukyanenko]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== In English ==

'''Social fiction''' is a broad term to describe any work of [[speculative fiction]] that features social commentary (as opposed to, say, hypothetical technology) in the foreground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/social-science-fiction|title=Social Science Fiction - Dictionary definition of Social Science Fiction - Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social science fiction is a subgenre thereof, where social commentary (cultural or political) takes place in a sci-fi universe. [[Utopian and dystopian fiction]] is a classic, polarized genre of social science fiction, although most works of science fiction can be interpreted as having social commentary of some kind or other as an important feature. It is not uncommon, therefore, for a sci-fi work to be labeled as social sci-fi as well as numerous other categories.

[[Thomas More]]'s book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516) represents an early example of the genre.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Another early classic writer, [[Jonathan Swift]], penned critical views on current society—his most famous work, ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1726), is an example of a novel that is partially social science fiction (with such classic sci-fi elements as pioneering in strange new worlds and experimenting with variations of the human anatomy) and partially high fantasy (e.g., fantastical races that satirize various sectors of society).

One of the writers who used science fiction to explore the sociology of  near-future topics was [[H. G. Wells]], with his classic ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895) revealing the human race diverging into separate branches of [[Eloi]]s and [[Morlock]]s as a consequence of [[Social class|class inequality]]: a happy pastoral society of Elois preyed upon by the Morlocks but yet needing them to keep their world functioning—a thinly veiled criticism of capitalist society, where the exploiter class, or the bourgeoisie, is symbolized by the useless, frivolous Elois, and the exploited working class, or the proletariat, is represented by the subterranean-dwelling, malnourished Morlocks. Wells' ''[[The Sleeper Awakes]]'' (1899, 1910) predicted the spirit of the 20th century: technically advanced, undemocratic and bloody. Next to prognoses of the future of society if current social problems persisted, as well as depictions of alien societies that are exaggerated versions of ours (exemplified by ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' of 1897), Wells also heavily criticized the then-popular concept of vivisection, experimental "psychiatry" and research that was done for the purpose of restructuring the human mind and memory (clearly emphasized in ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'', 1896).

Other early examples of influential novels include ''[[Vril|Vril, the Power of the Coming Race]]'' (1871) by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]],  ''[[Erewhon]]'' (1872) by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], [[Looking Backward|''Looking Backward: 2000-1887'']] (1888) by [[Edward Bellamy]] and ''[[News from Nowhere]]'' (1890) by [[William Morris]]

In the U.S. the new trend of science fiction away from gadgets and space opera and toward speculation about the human condition{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} was championed in pulp magazines of the 1940s by authors such as [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and by [[Isaac Asimov]], who coined the term "social science fiction" to describe his own work.&lt;ref&gt;In his essay appearing in ''Modern Science Fiction: Its Meaning and Its Future'' (ed. [[Reginald Bretnor]], 1953).&lt;/ref&gt; The term is not often used today except in the context of referring specifically to the changes that took place in the 1940s,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} but the subgenre it defines is still a mainstay of science fiction.

Utopian fiction eventually gave birth to a negative and often more cynical genre, known as [[dystopia]]n: [[Aldous Huxley]]'s "negative utopia" ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) and, ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945) and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) by [[George Orwell]]. "The thought-destroying force" of [[McCarthyism]] influenced [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1953). Examples of [[young adult fiction|young adult]] dystopian fiction include ''[[The Hunger Games (novel)|The Hunger Games]]'' (2008) by [[Suzanne Collins]], ''[[The House of the Scorpion]]'' (2002) by [[Nancy Farmer]], ''[[Divergent (novel)|Divergent]]'' (2011) by [[Veronica Roth]], ''[[The Maze Runner]]'' (2009) by [[James Dashner]], and ''[[Delirium (Lauren Oliver novel)|Delirium]]'' (2011) by [[Lauren Oliver]].

''[[The Chrysalids]]'' (1955) by [[John Wyndham]] explored the society of several telepathic children in a world hostile to such differences. [[Robert Sheckley]] studied polar civilizations of criminal and stability in his 1960 novel ''[[The Status Civilization]]''.

The modern era of social science fiction began with the 1960s,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} when authors such as [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Brian Aldiss]], [[William Gibson]] and [[Frank Herbert]] wrote novels and stories that reflected real-world political developments and ecological issues, but also experimented in creating hypothetical societies of the future or of parallel populated planets. Ellison's main theme was the protest against increasing militarism. [[Kurt Vonnegut]] wrote ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' (1969), which used the science-fiction storytelling device of [[time travel in fiction|time-travel]] to explore anti-war, moral, and sociological themes. [[Frederik Pohl]]'s series ''[[Gateway (novel)|Gateway]]'' (1977–2004) combined social science fiction with [[hard science-fiction]]. Modern exponents of social science fiction in the [[John W. Campbell|Campbellian]]/[[Robert A. Heinlein|Heinlein]] tradition include [[L. Neil Smith]] who wrote both ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' (1981) and ''[[Pallas (Heinlein)|Pallas]]'', which dealt with [[Alternate future|alternative "sideways in time" futures]] and what a libertarian society would look like. He is considered{{by whom|date=March 2015}} the heir to [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s [[individualism]] and [[libertarianism]] in science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Fitting, Peter. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20719029 "Utopias Beyond Our Ideals: The Dilemma of the Right-Wing Utopia."] Utopian Studies. Vol. 2, No. 1/2, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Today, the tradition is continued, although the term may be out of use. --&gt;[[Kim Stanley Robinson]] explored different models of the future in his ''[[Three Californias Trilogy]]'' (1984, 1988, 1990)&lt;!-- and carried out extensive studies of Mars colonization in ''[[Mars trilogy]]'' (1992, 1993, 1996) --&gt;.

''[[The Saga of Recluce]]'' (1991–present), by [[L. E. Modesitt, Jr.]] represents a fusion of science fiction and [[fantasy]] that can be described{{by whom|date=March 2015}} as social science fiction. The 13 books of the series describe the changing relationships between two technologically advanced cultures and the cultures of a primitive world to which each is involuntarily transported. Themes of gender stereotyping, sexism, ethics, economics, environmentalism and politics are explored in the course of the series, which examines the world through the eyes of all its protagonists.

[[Doris Lessing]] won the 2007 Nobel Prize for literature. Although mostly known for her mainstream works, she wrote numerous notable works of social science fiction, including ''[[Memoirs of a Survivor]]'' (1974), ''[[Briefing for a Descent into Hell]]'' (1971), the ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series (1974–1983), and ''[[The Cleft]]'' (2007).

'''South Jutlandic''' or '''South Jutish''' (South Jutish: ''Synnejysk''; {{lang-da|Sønderjysk}}; {{lang-de|Südjütisch or Plattdänisch}}) is a dialect of the [[Danish language]]. South Jutlandic is spoken in [[Southern Jutland]] (''Sønderjylland''; also called [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig or Slesvig]]) on both sides of the border between Denmark and Germany.

Variants of the dialect include Western and Eastern South Jutlandic (including Alsisk). The former variant in [[Angeln]] and [[Schwansen]] was known as ''Angel Danish''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dialekt.ku.dk/dialekter/hvor_mange_danske_dialekter/ Københavsn Universitet: Hvor mange dialekter er der i Danmark]&lt;/ref&gt;

The other dialects classified as belonging to the [[Jutlandic]] or [[Jutlandic dialect|Jutish]] (''Jysk'') group of dialects are [[West Jutlandic|West]], [[East Jutlandic|East]], and [[North Jutlandic]].

[[Image:Sønderjylland.png|thumb|right|Map of Northern and Southern Schleswig (Southern Jutland)]]

=== Northern Slesvig ===
Many older people will still speak a distinct South Jutlandic dialect, both in towns and rural areas. Younger people and children are more likely to use a dialect-tinted version of Standard Danish, but everything ranging from relatively pure dialect to Standard Danish can be found. Many are able to switch between both varieties.

A renewed popular interest in preserving the South Jutlandic dialect has been seen in recent years. This revival has been fuelled by the works of several local artists and authors as well as  Æ Synnejysk Forening, a society working for the promotion of the dialect.

Several schools now offer the dialect as an optional subject, but ''Rigsdansk'', the official Danish, remains a compulsory subject.

Members of the South Jutlandic minority on the German side of the border tend to emphasize their South Jutlandic identity. Many members of this minority are in one way or another connected with agriculture, the dialect being more prevalent in rural communities. The German minority usually speak South Jutlandic with each other and with Danish-minded people alike, but prefer German for writing and official occasions such as meetings. Standard Danish is mastered as well and is taught in schools, along with Standard German.

=== Southern Slesvig ===
South Jutlandic is still spoken to some degree in villages up to about 15&amp;nbsp;km south of the Danish-German border, but hardly in the major city of Flensburg, where the Danish speakers speak Standard Danish. Most people will be able to speak or understand Low German and sometimes North Frisian. All will know High German, often being the only language of young people and children. Members of the Danish minority are taught Standard Danish as well in schools, but often choose to communicate in German in everyday life.

Language (and especially spoken language) is not necessarily linked with national identification. Family ties and informal local contact across the border used to be very common, with South Jutlandic being the first language of both Danish minded and German minded people. Sometimes the purest South Jutlandic may be found among older people who identify as German. Since they have not attended Danish schools, their speech is not influenced by Standard Danish. With urbanisation in the recent decades this crisscross of dialects and national sentiment has faded, High German becoming the first choice everywhere, but often some South Jutlandic words are retained in the vocabulary.

==History==
Historically, the Danish language had a much larger extension in South Slesvig than today. South Jutlandic was spoken down to the [[Danevirke]] wall south of Schleswig town, close to the Viking town of [[Hedeby]], and to [[Eckernförde]] on the east coast. South of this was a sparsely inhabited area which after the [[Viking age]] became populated with [[Saxons|Saxon]] settlers whose language is now better known as [[Low German]]. The western islands and the west coast were settled by [[Frisians]]. A little further inland Frisians and Danes were mixed.

With the [[Reformation in Denmark|reformation]] in the 16th century the national language was installed in church instead of Latin. In Slesvig this meant not the language of the peasantry, but that of the dukes and gentry, being first Low German and later High German. German was the language of administration in all of Slesvig. In Northern Slesvig, however, priests were educated at the chapter of [[Haderslev]] and Danish was spoken in church. The church language border was very similar to the present-day Danish-German border which was created by [[plebiscite]] in 1920.

During the 17th and the 18th centuries, the population in the area south of the [[Schlei]] (Sli) inlet switched to Low German, few details being known about their former South Jutlandic dialect. The people of [[Angeln]] (Danish ''Angel''), the countryside between Flensburg and the Schlei where the [[Angles]] who settled England also originally came from, kept to their South Jutlandic dialect for a longer time, but often had some knowledge of [[Low German]] as well.

The Angel dialect became extinct around 1900. A few records of it exist and show that it was similar to the South Jutlandic of the [[Sønderborg]] area in North Slesvig, across the [[Flensburger Förde|Flensborg Fjord]]. The Low German dialect of Angel still has a great deal of Danish words and grammatical influence, which makes it difficult to understand for other Low German speakers.&lt;ref&gt;For an extensive discussion of the interaction between South Jutish and Low German with lots of examples from the now extinct South Jutish dialects of Angeln, Viöl, Flensburg &amp;c. see BOCK, KARL NIELSEN. Niederdeutsch auf dänischem Substrat. Studien zur Dialektgeographie Südostschleswigs. Mit 51 Abbildungen und einer Karte. Kph., 1933, 351 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century the South Jutlandic dialect had a status inferior to Low German, and parents started to encourage their children to speak Low German, so they would be better prepared for school, where education was in High German. Some scholars assume that centuries with German spoken in church made people identify with the German nationality, even if they still spoke a Danish vernacular at home.

The Danish government, for political reasons, wished to halt this [[language shift]] from Danish to German. After the [[First War of Schleswig]], in 1851, the government issued the Slesvig Language Rescripts, ordering the school language to be Danish in areas that  the peasantry spoke Danish and even in an area stretching further south, into the Low German speaking area. Church language would alternate between Danish and German.&lt;ref&gt;[[Laurence M. Larson]]: ''Prussianism in North Sleswick'', American Historical Review, Vol. 24, No. 2 (Jan., 1919), pp. 227-252, {{doi|10.2307/1835165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standard Danish had never been widely used in South Slesvig even where the populace spoke a Danish dialect. The dominant official language was German, and the measures of the government had quite the adverse effect, reinforcing anti-Danish sentiment. A pattern emerged, with the poorest in rural areas sticking to South Jutlandic, the wealthier peasants speaking Low German as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' and the educated townsmen speaking High German.

An interesting variety of South Jutlandic was spoken until the 1940s in an area west of the town of Schleswig, 40&amp;nbsp;km south of the present border. Called ''Fjoldedansk'' after the village [[Viöl|Fjolde]] (German: Viöl) or ''sydslesvigsk'' (southern Schleswigian), the dialect had many archaic features otherwise lost in Danish, such as verbs fully inflected in person and number. The village was isolated between surrounding moorland, creating a [[language island]], similar to the case of the [[Saterland Frisian language]].

== Place names ==
Place names in South Slesvig are of almost exclusively Danish origin, except in North Frisia and the southernmost area. Typical Scandinavian endings include ''-by, -bøl, -trup, -lund, -ved, -toft'' (in German form: ''-by, -büll, -trup, -lund, -witt, -toft''). In some cases the South Jutlandic form has been eradicated from the Standard Danish variety of the name, but is still visible in the Germanised version:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graenseforeningen.dk/artikel/3845 Stednavne&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061117081652/http://www.graenseforeningen.dk/artikel/3845 |date=2006-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many other cases the Germanised versions are out of [[etymology|etymological]] context. Examples include the Danish ending ''-næs'' (isthmus) being replaced by ''-nitz'', a Slavic ending which is common in eastern Germany. Such arbitrary translations were often made by the central Prussian government after the whole of Slesvig was ceded to [[Prussia]] after the [[Second War of Schleswig|war of 1864]].

The South Jutlandic name of the town of [[Schleswig]] (Slesvig), from which the region derives its name, was ''Sljasvig'' with the stress on the second syllable.

 .Re-use and fill the infobox from [[Xhosa language]]
 .Sort/separate infos about [[Ndebele language]] and [[Ndebele]] people,
  avoid confusion between the larger Ndebele (similar to Zulu/ Xhosa) people and the smaller Southern Ndebele people,

==Overview==
The Southern Transvaal Ndebele people's history has been traced back to King Ndebele, King Ndebele fathered King Mkhalangana, King Mkhalangana fathered King Mntungwa (not to be confused with the Khumalo Mntungwa, because he was fathered by Mbulazi), King Mntungwa fathered King Jonono, King Jonono fathered King Nanasi, King Nanasi fathered King Mafana, king Mafana fathered King Mhlanga and Chief Libhoko, King Mhlanga fathered King Musi and Chief Skhube.

Ndebele – Some of his sons were left behind with the Hlubi tribe&lt;br/&gt;
Mkhalangana – Some of his sons branched and formed the Kalanga tribe&lt;br/&gt;
Mntungwa – Founder of the amaNtungwa clan&lt;br/&gt;
Njonono – He died in Jononoskop near Ladysmith – Surname Jonono is in the Hlubi tribe&lt;br/&gt;
Nanasi – He died in Jononoskop near Ladysmith – Surname Nanasi is in the Hlubi tribe&lt;br/&gt;
Mafana – He died in Randfontein (Emhlangeni)&lt;br/&gt;
Mhlanga – He died in Randfontein (Emhlangeni)&lt;br/&gt;
Musi – He died in kwaMnyamana (Pretoria)

King Musi's kraal was based at eMhlangeni a place named after his father Mhlanga, the name of the place is currently known as Randfontein (Mohlakeng) and later moved to KwaMnyamana which is now called Emarula or Bon Accord in Pretoria.
King Musi was a polygamist and fathered the following sons, Skhosana (Masombuka), Manala (Mbuduma), Ndzundza (Hlungwana), Thombeni (Kekana or Gegana), Sibasa, Mhwaduba (Lekhuleni) and Mphafuli and others.

Southern Transvaal Ndebele is one of the eleven official languages in the Republic of South Africa. The language is a Nguni or Zunda classification (UN) spoken mostly in the Mpumalanga Province, Gauteng, Limpopo and the Northwest.

The expression "isikhethu" can be loosely translated to mean 'the Southern Ndebele way of doing or saying'. Isikhethu means Southern Ndebele the same way that sikitsi will mean Swazi and se harona will mean Sotho.
The language has been severely marginalised over the years. Until the formation of the apartheid Southern Ndebele [[bantustan|homeland]] ([[KwaNdebele]]), speaking the language publicly was discouraged. Most Southern Transvaal Ndebele speakers preferred Zulu especially because the latter was learned at school. Today the Southern Ndebele speakers, mostly those who are educated still prefer to use Southern Ndebele as home language for their children and will use Southern Ndebele as a language to communicate with other Southern Ndebele speakers.

[[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]]/ Zimbabwean Ndebele (Northern Ndebele) is part of the Zunda sub-group of the Nguni languages and is similar to Xhosa and Zulu, while the South African (or Southern Transvaal Ndebele), while maintaining its Nguni roots, has been more influenced by the Sotho languages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Skhosana, P.B. (2010) The Linguistic Relationship between Southern and Northern Ndebele, University of Pretoria, DLitt Thesis&lt;/ref&gt; Southern Transvaal Ndebele and [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]] are both part of the Nguni language group and are therefore share a few words in common.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northernndebele.blogspot.com www.northernndebele.blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The D'oh-cial Network'''" is the eleventh episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 23)|twenty-third season]] of the American animated sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on January 15, 2012. In the episode, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] is sad that she has no real friends. She discovers that it is easier to make friends on the Internet and therefore creates a [[social networking]] website called SpringFace. It becomes incredibly popular in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] and Lisa gets many online friends. However, they still ignore her in real life, and the website starts to cause trouble in the town when people use it while driving and cause accidents. Lisa is put on trial and the court orders her to close down SpringFace.

The episode is a satire of the social networking website [[Facebook]] and parodies the film ''[[The Social Network]]'', which tells the story of how Facebook was founded. The [[Winklevoss twins]], who sued Facebook founder [[Mark Zuckerberg]] for stealing their idea, are featured in the episode. Actor [[Armie Hammer]] portrayed the twins in both ''The Social Network'' and "The D'oh-cial Network". This episode also features a guest appearance by talk show host [[David Letterman]] as himself, appearing in the [[The Simpsons opening sequence|''Simpsons'' opening sequence]]. Since airing, "The D'oh-cial Network" has received generally mixed response from television reviewers, with criticism directed at its satire. Around 11.48 million Americans tuned in to watch the episode during its original broadcast.

==Plot==
The episode starts in a courtroom where [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] is on trial. The [[Blue-Haired Lawyer]] is accusing her of bringing devastation upon [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] because of her selfish desire to be accepted by others. Lisa starts telling everyone in the courtroom about her side of the story. A few months ago, she and [[Simpson family|her family]] went to the new mall in town. There, she encountered her schoolmates [[Sherri and Terri]] and asked them if she could spend some time with them at the mall. The two twins said no to Lisa, which made her realize that she has no real friends. Later, Lisa went on Homer's computer and discovered that it is easier to make friends online than in real life, and thus she started a [[social networking]] website called SpringFace to get friends. The site became instantly popular among all the citizens of Springfield and Lisa made over a thousand friends in a short period of time. However, Lisa soon noticed that these friends only talked to her on SpringFace and not in real life. She also discovered that the website grew too big to control, with people becoming so addicted to it that they even used it while driving their cars. This caused chaos in the town after numerous car crashes and deaths.

In the present time, the court orders Lisa to shut down SpringFace, and Lisa agrees to do this. The people of Springfield throw away their [[smartphone]]s and computers soon after the website is closed. When Lisa looks outside her window, she sees Sherri and Terri and a bunch of their friends playing [[Marco Polo (game)|Marco Polo]], and they invite Lisa to join them. [[Patty and Selma]] are then seen competing in a rowing race against the [[Winklevoss twins]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012 Olympics]], with Patty and Selma winning. This is followed by a short entitled "A Simpsons 'Show's Too Short' Story", animated in the dark, grim style of American artist [[Edward Gorey]].&lt;ref name=Ledesma-finishing/&gt; It tells the story of how [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] was a troublemaker from the day he was born, and shows him and [[Milhouse]] wrapping [[Springfield Elementary School]] in toilet paper.

"The D'oh-cial Network" was written by [[J. Stewart Burns]] and directed by [[Chris Clements (animation director)|Chris Clements]] as part of the twenty-third season of ''The Simpsons'' (2011–2012).&lt;ref name=Ledesma-dohcialnetwork/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The D'oh-cial Network |episodelink= |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits= |network=Fox |station= |airdate=2012-01-15 |season=23|seriesno= |number=11 |minutes=05:18–05:22 |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second episode written by Burns that season, the first being "[[Holidays of Future Passed]]".&lt;ref name=Childs/&gt; According to Hayden Childs of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', the episode satirizes the phenomenon of the social networking website [[Facebook]]. He commented that "the thrust of the satire can be summed up with the age-old cry of parents to their offspring to put that damn thing down and go outside already."&lt;ref name=Childs/&gt; Childs added that the episode points out "the most blatant of the many faults of Facebook—namely, its hypnotic ability to distract people in a semi-narcissistic haze [...]".&lt;ref name=Childs/&gt;

"The D'oh-cial Network" also parodies the 2010 drama film ''[[The Social Network]]'', which portrays the founding of Facebook by [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and the subsequent lawsuit by American rowers [[Winklevoss twins|Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss]] who claimed Zuckerberg stole their idea.&lt;ref name=Childs/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cole&gt;{{cite news|last=Cole|first=Tom|title=The Simpsons celebrate the London 2012 Olympics in The D'oh-cial Network|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-08-03/the-simpsons-celebrate-the-london-2012-olympics-in-the-doh-cial-network|accessdate=2012-08-12|newspaper=[[Radio Times]]|date=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hewett|first=Emily|title=The Simpsons special sees Patty and Selma in London 2012 Olympics|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/907155-the-simpsons-special-sees-patty-and-selma-in-london-2012-olympics|accessdate=2012-08-12|newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Social Network'', like the episode, features a scene in which the Winklevoss twins are seen rowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hammer brings Social Network role to Simpsons|url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/2011/0723/simpsons.html|accessdate=2012-08-12|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]]|date=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, it was announced in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that American actor [[Armie Hammer]] would make a guest appearance in "The D'oh-cial Network", playing the Winklevoss twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/07/armie-hammer-will-once-again-take-on-the-role-of-both-winklevoss-twins-but-this-time-it-wont-be-in-a-cineplex-itll-be-on.html|title= Armie Hammer to play Winklevoss twins again on 'The Simpsons'|first=Nathan|last=Olivarez-Giles|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=2011-07-22|accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/22/armie-hammer-reprises-win_n_907243.html|title=Armie Hammer Reprises Winklevei Role On Simpsons|work=[[Huffington Post]]|publisher=[[Arianna Huffington]]|date=2011-07-22|accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hammer previously attained that role in ''The Social Network''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oarsome Simpsons|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4467283/The-Simpsons-Patty-and-Selma-join-the-Olympics-as-they-row-the-Thames-in-new-episode.html|accessdate=2012-08-12|newspaper=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|date=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Simpsons parody the London Olympics|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9449248/Simpsons-parody-the-London-Olympics.html|accessdate=2012-08-12|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Wook|title=Rings ‘n’ Things: 10 Best Facts About the Olympics in Pop Culture|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/08/03/rings-n-things-10-best-facts-about-the-olympics-in-pop-culture/slide/the-simpsons/#the-simpsons|accessdate=2012-08-12|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Simpsons'' [[showrunner]] [[Al Jean]], the staff of the show decided not to ask the  Winklevoss twins to guest star in the episode as themselves because "We [the staff] were like, 'Wait, [Hammer] played them, that's who people think they are, we should just get him.'"&lt;ref name="hammer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/07/22/armie-hammer-simpsons/|title=Armie Hammer to play the Winklevoss twins again... on 'The Simpsons'!|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Snierson, Dan|accessdate=2011-07-22|date=2011-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hammer met with the producers of the series in May 2011 to record his lines.&lt;ref name="hammer"/&gt;

''The Simpsons'' music editor Chris Ledesma wrote on his blog that there was originally a discussion among the staff of the show about how the sequence would be [[Film score|scored]]. According to Ledesma, Jean "wanted something hustly-bustly that represented New York City. Thoughts immediately turned to the music of [[George Gershwin]]. [[Woody Allen]] had used 'Rhapsody in Blue' to great effect in ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' and probably connected forever in people’s minds the black &amp; white images of New York with the melodies of that piece."&lt;ref name=Ledesma-finishing/&gt; Ledesma wrote that acquiring the license to use the musical piece was expensive, but Jean thought "it would be the perfect piece to use for the couch gag."&lt;ref name=Ledesma-finishing/&gt; The [[dark cabaret]] band [[Tiger Lillies]] performed their version of the [[The Simpsons Theme|''Simpsons'' theme]] over the closing credits of the episode.&lt;ref name=Ledesma-finishing&gt;{{cite web|last=Ledesma|first=Chris|title=Finishing 'Politically Inept with Homer Simpson' &amp; 'The D’oh-cial Network' and Starting 'Moe Goes from Rags to Riches'|url=http://simpsonsmusic500.wordpress.com/2012/01/17/finishing-politically-inept-with-homer-simpson-the-doh-cial-network-and-starting-moe-goes-from-rags-to-riches/|publisher=Simpsons Music 500|accessdate=2012-07-23|date=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]], a fan of the band, was responsible for recruiting its members to the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Simpsons theme tune performed by The Tiger Lillies!|url=http://www.tigerlillies.com/904247/news/the-simpsons-theme-tune-performed-by-the-tiger-lillies|publisher=The Tiger Lillies|accessdate=2012-08-11|date=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The episode originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on January 15, 2012.&lt;ref name=Ledesma-dohcialnetwork&gt;{{cite web|last=Ledesma|first=Chris|title=Starting 'The D’oh-cial Network'|url=http://simpsonsmusic500.wordpress.com/2011/12/22/starting-the-doh-cial-network/|accessdate=2011-12-23|date=2011-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was watched by approximately 11.48 million people during this broadcast, and in the [[Nielsen ratings#Demographics|demographic for adults aged 18–49]], the episode received a 5.4 [[Nielsen ratings#Ratings/share and total viewers|Nielsen rating]] and a thirteen percent [[Nielsen ratings#Ratings/share and total viewers|share]].&lt;ref name=ratings2&gt;{{cite web|last=Gorman|first=Bill|title=Sunday Final Ratings: 'The Good Wife' Adjusted Up; 'Pan Am' Adjusted Down + Giants/Packers, Unscrambled Fox|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/01/18/sunday-final-ratings-the-good-wife-adjusted-up-pan-am-adjusted-down-giantspackers-unscrambled-fox/116808/|publisher=[[TV by the Numbers]]|accessdate=2012-08-07|date=2012-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a large increase over the previous episode of the series, "[[Politically Inept, with Homer Simpson]]", which received a 2.3 rating. However, "The D'oh-cial Network" was preceded by a popular [[2011–12 NFL playoffs|National Football League playoffs]] game that helped improve its rating.&lt;ref name=ratings1&gt;{{cite web|last=Gorman|first=Bill|title=Updated TV Ratings Sunday: 'Golden Globes' Down Slightly, FOX Animation Scores Big After Football, 'Once Upon A Time,' 'Housewives,' 'Good Wife' Fall|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/01/16/tv-ratings-sunday-golden-globes-steady-ish-fox-animation-scores-big-after-football-once-upon-a-time-housewives-good-wife-fall/116567/|publisher=[[TV by the Numbers]]|accessdate=2012-08-05|date=2012-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode became the highest-rated broadcast in Fox's [[Animation Domination]] lineup that night in terms of both total viewers and in the 18–49 demographic, finishing ahead of new episodes of  ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[Napoleon Dynamite (TV series)|Napoleon Dynamite]]''.&lt;ref name=ratings2/&gt; For the week of {{nowrap|January 9–15, 2012,}} "The D'oh-cial Network" placed third in the ratings among all prime-time broadcasts in the 18–49 demographic, being beaten only by two football games.

The reception of "The D'oh-cial Network" by television critics has been generally mixed. ''[[The Guardian]]'' reviewer Sam Wollaston called the episode "lovely", arguing that while "''The Simpsons'' perhaps doesn't deliver as often as it once did," this episode proved "it still can, after all this time."&lt;ref name=Wollaston&gt;{{cite news|last=Wollaston|first=Sam|title=TV review: Exploring China: A Culinary Adventure; The Dark: Nature's Nighttime World; The Simpsons|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/05/tv-review-exploring-china-culinary?newsfeed=true|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2012-08-07|date=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Evening Herald]]''{{'}}s Pat Stacey wrote that it has "been a while since ''The Simpsons'' delivered a gold medal-standard performance, yet at least there were satisfying flashes of silver [in this episode]."&lt;ref name=Stacey/&gt; She added that she "liked the moment when [[Hans Moleman]] is hit by Homer's car and frantically hammers the 'Dislike' button as he sails through the air."&lt;ref name=Stacey&gt;{{cite news|last=Stacey|first=Pat|title=TV dreams are made of this|url=http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/tv-dreams-are-made-of-this-3190555.html|newspaper=[[Evening Herald]]|accessdate=2012-08-07|date=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayden Childs of ''The A.V. Club'' thought the episode was less successful at satirizing Facebook compared to the episode "Holidays of Future Passed". He explained that there is "a moment in 'Holidays' when Lisa steps into the future version of the Internet and is immediately besieged by a mountain of friend requests. That was a small yet sharp parody of Facebook’s ubiquity, but ['The D'oh-cial Network'] lays into the same topic with a less deft touch."&lt;ref name=Childs/&gt; Childs added that the episode "has a few good jokes to keep the proceedings moving along, but not enough to rescue [it] from mediocrity."&lt;ref name=Childs/&gt; He concluded that he thought the story ended too fast with Lisa shutting down her website and the citizens of Springfield returning to their everyday technology-lacking life:  "That’s a bit too quick a turn, [...] slapping a moralistic tone onto all of the preceding satire."&lt;ref name=Childs/&gt; David Crawford of ''[[Radio Times]]'' commented that "The D'oh-cial Network" features "a rather thin attempt to parody ''The Social Network''".&lt;ref name=Crawford&gt;{{cite news|last=Crawford|first=David|title=Series 23 – 10.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1804">In the 1880s, the '''Thirteen Club''' was created to debunk the [[superstition]] of "13 at a table" being unlucky. This belief states that when 13 people are seated together at a table, one will die within a year. They met on the 13th of the month for a dinner served to 13 people at each table.

By 1887, the Thirteen Club was 400-strong, over time gaining five [[U.S. Presidents]] as honorary members: [[Chester Arthur]], [[Grover Cleveland]], [[Benjamin Harrison]], [[William McKinley]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]].  

The "13 at a table" superstition may take its origin from [[The Last Supper]] wherein 13 people dined ([[Jesus]] and his twelve disciples) and Jesus died soon after, or from the Valhalla Banquet story in [[Norse mythology]]. That story tells about 12 gods invited to a banquet. [[Loki]], making thirteen, intrudes and [[Balder]], the favourite of the gods, is killed.

In New York at the December 13, 1886 meeting of the Thirteen Club, [[Robert Green Ingersoll]] ended his toast, "The Superstitions of Public Men":
{{cquote|We have had enough mediocrity, enough policy, enough superstition, enough prejudice, enough provincialism, and the time has come for the American citizen to say: "Hereafter I will be represented by men who are worthy, not only of the great Republic, but of the Nineteenth Century.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3988">'''Tunagate''' was a 1985 [[Canada|Canadian]] [[political scandal]] involving large quantities of [[tuna]] that had been declared unfit for human consumption that were sold to the public under order of the [[Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (Canada)|Minister of Fisheries and Oceans]], [[John Allen Fraser|John Fraser]].

The story broke on September 17 in the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] program ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV)|the fifth estate]]''. Fisheries inspectors had found that [[StarKist Tuna|StarKist]] tuna, made by a [[New Brunswick]] plant, had spoiled, and declared that it was “unfit for human consumption.”&lt;ref&gt;"Minister OK'd sale of rancid tuna: report; Overruled inspectors after call from Hatfield, CBC says. ''The Gazette.'' Sep 18, 1985. pg. A.14&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[St. Andrews, New Brunswick]] plant had processed the tuna, and the forced destruction of a million cans of tuna would likely cause the plant to close down. The owners of the plant thus lobbied fisheries minister Fraser. He decided the tuna should be allowed on store shelves. He later defended himself saying he felt the business owners were right that the inspectors were too severe, or that the inspectors could have made a mistake. He also stated that he had two other independent groups test the tuna, but the laboratory that did these tests later revealed that their testing was not complete when Fraser made his decision.&lt;ref&gt;"Tuna released before testing was complete, document says." Michael Harris. ''The Globe and Mail.'' Sep 21, 1985. pg. P.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after the story broke, both opposition parties attacked Fraser, and on Thursday, a recall of the tuna was announced. The following Monday Fraser resigned, mostly settling the affair. Rules were changed to make it impossible for ministers to overrule the decision of food inspectors.&lt;ref&gt;"Federal ministers to be stopped from overruling food inspectors." ''Toronto Star.'' Mar 7, 1986. pg. A.10&lt;/ref&gt;

The main unanswered question was how much Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] knew at the time. Fraser at first stated that he had informed the Prime Minister’s Office. Mulroney originally said so as well. Almost immediately afterwards both recanted and stated that Mulroney had not been informed until the story had broken. Mulroney was also accused of being less than truthful when he told the ''[[New York Times]]'' he had fired Fraser as soon as he had heard of the affair, when in fact it had taken six days.&lt;ref&gt;"Mulroney accused of lying over Fraser's tuna downfall." Joel Ruimy. ''Toronto Star.'' Mar 22, 1986. pg. A.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite intense national coverage for many weeks, in the end, the story ended up being mostly forgotten. Today there remains no evidence of any people getting sick from the tuna that was sold. Fraser’s career recovered and eventually he became [[Speaker of the House of Commons (Canada)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;"Fraser proves there's life after tuna." Don Braid. ''The Gazette.'' Oct 2, 1986. pg. B.3&lt;/ref&gt; The reputations of both StarKist Canada and the Mulroney government were hurt, however. StarKist, which had enjoyed a thirty-nine percent market share, saw it collapse to near zero, and in 1991, it pulled out of Canada. The four hundred employees of the New Brunswick plant were put out of work as one of the largest employers in [[Charlotte County, New Brunswick|Charlotte County]] shut down.&lt;ref&gt;Star-Kist to lay off 400 workers. ''The Ottawa Citizen.'' Sep 30, 1985. pg. A.2&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University Club of Washington, D.C.''', is an American [[gentlemen's club|private club]] in [[Downtown (Washington, D.C.)|downtown]] [[Washington, D.C.]], United States.

==History==

Established in 1904 simply as the University Club, its first president was then Secretary of War and future United States President [[William Howard Taft]].  In 1936, it merged with the '''Racquet Club of Washington''', and moved to its current location at 1135 Sixteenth Street NW, approximately three blocks north of the [[White House]].&lt;ref name="universityclubdc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityclubdc.com/Default.aspx?p=DynamicModule&amp;pageid=240299 |title=History - University Club of Washington DC |publisher=Universityclubdc.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Warren Court]] justices [[Earl Warren]] and [[Hugo Black]] would often use the Club's facilities to informally discuss and gather.&lt;ref name="universityclubdc" /&gt; 

==Reciprocity==
The Club has reciprocal agreements for its members with approximately 200 other athletic, country, and city clubs around the United States and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityclubdc.com/Default.aspx?p=DynamicModule&amp;pageid=240307 |title=Reciprocal Clubs - University Club of Washington DC |publisher=Universityclubdc.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trophy is presented jointly by The Tewaaraton Foundation and the University Club of Washington, D.C.. One trophy is presented to the top men's player, and one trophy is presented to the top women's player each year.

==Notable members==
Notable past and current Club members include former Speaker of the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] [[Tip O'Neill]],&lt;ref name="universityclubdc" /&gt; former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]],&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.muckety.com/2008/10/07/federal-judges-will-have-to-pay-for-golf-like-everyone-else/5571 |title=Supreme Court justices lose freebie memberships &amp;#124; Muckety - See the news |publisher=News.muckety.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; numerous [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justices,&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; former [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Homeland Security Secretary]] [[Tom Ridge]], and former [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zakheim |first=Roger I. |url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/article/129278#.UCftc2Oe7gI |title=Rummy is a University man |publisher=WashingtonExaminer.com |date=2007-11-13 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ursari''' (generally read as "bear leaders" or "bear handlers"; from the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''urs'', meaning "bear"; singular: ''ursar''; [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: урсари, ''ursari'') or '''Richinara''' are the traditionally [[nomad]]ic occupational group of [[Animal training|animal trainers]] among the [[Romani people]].

An [[Endogamy|endogamous]] category originally drawing the bulk of its income from [[busking]] performances in which they used [[dancing bear]]s, usually [[brown bear]]s and, in several instances, [[Old World monkey|Old world monkeys]], they have largely become settled after the 1850s. The Ursari form an important part of the [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma community]] in [[Romania]], where they are one of the 40 tribal groups,&lt;ref name="romiiromania"&gt;{{ro icon}} Centrul de Documentare şi Informare despre Minorităţile din Europa de Sud-Est, [http://adatbank.transindex.ro/html/cim_pdf452.pdf ''Romii din România''], at the [http://adatbank.transindex.ro/ Erdélyi Magyar Adatbank], retrieved June 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; as well as notable segments of the [[Bulgaria]]n [[Roma in Bulgaria|Roma population]] and of the one in [[Moldova]].

==History==
{{Main|Roma minority in Romania|Roma in Bulgaria}}

===Early migrations and slavery===
[[File:Tanzbär 1810.jpg|thumb|320px|Print showing of a dancing bear and its handlers in [[Hesse]], ca. 1810]]
Groups of bear-handlers are known to have existed during the population's transit through the [[Byzantine Empire]], as early as the 12th century, when they are mentioned in connection with the ''[[Melchisedechians|Athinganoi]]'' (Roma people) by [[Theodore Balsamon]].&lt;ref name="angusfraser"/&gt; In later decades, they were probably among the people collectively referred to as "[[Egyptians (Balkans)|Egyptians]]".&lt;ref name="angusfraser"/&gt;

The Ursari formed part of the [[Slavery|slave]] population in the [[Danubian Principalities]] ([[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]) before the [[Abolitionism|abolitions]] of the 1840s and 1850s. With the Boyash (including the gold-[[prospecting]] ''Zlătari''), the [[Kalderash]], and groups of Roma [[Smith (metalwork)|smiths]], Ursari formed the category of ''lăieşi'', who, unlike ''vătraşi'' slaves, were allowed to carry on with a nomadic lifestyle (being required by their [[boyar]] masters to pay various benefits in exchange for the permission).&lt;ref name="djuvara"&gt;[[Neagu Djuvara]], ''Între Orient şi Occident. Ţările române la începutul epocii moderne'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 1995, p.267-269. {{ISBN|973-28-0523-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pons"&gt;{{ro icon}} Emmanuelle Pons, [http://adatbank.transindex.ro/html/cim_pdf450.pdf ''De la robie la asimilare''], p.18-19, at the [http://adatbank.transindex.ro/ Erdélyi Magyar Adatbank], retrieved June 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early decades of the 19th century, most of the state-owned Roma were ''lăieşi'', as opposed to private-owned ones.&lt;ref name="grigoreantrop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="djuvara"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thouvenel"&gt;[[Édouard Antoine Thouvenel]], ''La Hongrie et la Valachie'', Arthus Betrand, Paris, 1840, p.242-243&lt;/ref&gt; The ''lăieşi'' were required to contribute an annual sum to the treasuries of Wallachia and Moldavia;&lt;ref name="pons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thouvenel"/&gt; [[Édouard Antoine Thouvenel]], a [[France|French]] diplomat who visited Wallachia during the period, indicated that, for Ursari families, this sum amounted to between twenty and thirty [[Turkish kuruş|piasters]],&lt;ref name="thouvenel"/&gt; and it is documented that the Boyash and the Ursari paid equivalent fees.&lt;ref name="pons"/&gt;

Like other nomadic Roma, Ursari are known to have traveled in large tribal groups during the 20th century,&lt;ref name="sendreazbacau"&gt;{{ro icon}} Eugen Şendrea, [http://www.ziaruldebacau.ro/index.php?articol=20889 "Distracţii de tîrgoveţi"], in ''[[Ziarul de Bacău]]'', May 26, 2007; retrieved June 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; although other sources indicate that they preferred to organize themselves on a tight and selective family-based structure.&lt;ref name="baerlein"&gt;Henry Baerlein (ed.), ''Romanian Oasis: A Further Anthology on Romania and Her People'', Frederick Muller Ltd., London, 1948, p.202&lt;/ref&gt; Ursari people and the Boyash-proper traditionally accompanied the Kalderash on their travels to [[Rumelia]], contributing to the birth of the ''Mechkara'' community.&lt;ref name="patrin"/&gt;

Thouvenel described the group's "miserable condition", and, in reference to their handling of brown bears, wrote: "[...] they reunite to give chase to [the bears], whom they [[Domestication|domesticate]] after capturing them in their youth, or whom they render unable to harm them. Bears in the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] are, after all, much smaller and of a less ferocious nature than those in the [[Nord (French department)|Nord]]; their leaders train them with relative ease and run around from village to village in order to collect a few ''[[Para (currency)|para]]'' as a result of peasant curiosity".&lt;ref name="thouvenel"/&gt;

Also according to Thouvenel, Ursari were known for "[[Veterinary medicine|veterinary]] skills", which, he argued, "the [[superstition]] of people in the countryside attributes to the possession of a [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] art".&lt;ref name="thouvenel"/&gt; In addition to bear handling, the community would occasionally trade in wild animals (specifically bear cubs),&lt;ref name="grigoreantrop"/&gt; and was known for keeping and training monkeys.&lt;ref name="patrin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fonseca, p.181&lt;/ref&gt; Female members of the community were known for their practice of [[fortune-telling]].&lt;ref name="sendreazbacau"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baerlein"/&gt;

===Emancipation===
[[File:Ursari in Transylvania 1869.jpg|thumb|220px|Ursari in [[Transylvania]], 1869 engraving]]
Speaking during the late 1880s, the historian and politician [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], who was responsible for the 1855 abolition of slavery in Moldavia under [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Grigore Alexandru Ghica]], claimed that: "aside from the [other] ''lăieşi'' Gypsies, who still live in part in Gypsy camps, and Ursari, who are presently working in the taming of wild beasts, but are nevertheless involved in working the land, almost all of the other classes of Gypsies have blended into the larger mass of the nation, and are only told apart by their swarthy and [[South Asia|Asian]]-like faces and the vividness of their imagination".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Dezrobirea_%C5%A3iganilor%2C_%C5%9Ftergerea_privilegiilor_boiere%C5%9Fti%2C_emanciparea_%C5%A3%C4%83ranilor ''Dezrobirea ţiganilor, ştergerea privilegiilor boiereşti, emanciparea ţăranilor''] (wikisource)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the creation of a [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Principality]], Ursari nonetheless remained a presence associated with [[busking]] and [[fair]]s, especially with those held in [[Bucharest]] and provincial cities such as [[Bacău]].&lt;ref name="sendreazbacau"/&gt;&lt;ref name="giurescu"&gt;[[Constantin C. Giurescu]], ''Istoria Bucureştilor. Din cele mai vechi timpuri pînă în zilele noastre'', [[Editura Pentru Literatură]], Bucharest, 1966, p.380. {{OCLC|1279610}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the rule of ''[[Domnitor]]'' [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]], they formed a staple of such spectacles, alongside the music-playing ''[[Lăutari]]'', the ''[[Căluşari]]'', and [[freak show]]s.&lt;ref name="giurescu"/&gt; At around the same time, they included a section of ''zavragii'', smiths who worked as [[day labor]]ers.&lt;ref name="grigoreantrop"/&gt; Also during the late 19th century, the Ursari came to be attested in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]]-ruled [[Bessarabia]], where the local population referred to them and to the ''lăieşi'' in general as ''şătraşi'' ("people living on campsites").&lt;ref name="grigoreantrop"/&gt;

Sometime after 1850, groups of Ursari, Kalderash and Lovari, most likely coming from [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] regions and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], moved westwards, and were mentioned for the first time as present in the [[North Brabant]] and other areas in the [[Netherlands]] (where their descendants still live).&lt;ref&gt;Lucassen, p.81-82, 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nikola Rašić, [http://www.kpcgroep.nl/assets/Paragraph/9264/Assets/6810/Downloaden%20(pdf).pdf ''Romanies in Netherlands''], at the [http://www.kpcgroep.nl/ KPC Groep], retrieved June 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A similar move originated in [[Serbia]], around [[Kragujevac]], with Boyash and Ursari moving into northern and central [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="pijatsromano"/&gt; In the Netherlands, central authorities reacted vehemently to the presence of Roma, labeling Ursari and the others with the loaded term "Gypsies"; the reaction of local authorities was more calm, and allowed Ursari to blend into Dutch society, even though most members of the latter community intended to settle in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;Lucassen, p.82, 83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Before and after the Porajmos===
In time, a significant number of Ursari joined [[circus]]es,&lt;ref name="pijatsromano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rombasecarneys"/&gt; while many others began manufacturing and trading bone objects and leather (as, respectively, ''[[Pieptănari]]'' and ''[[Ciurari]]''), or associating with the ''Lăutari''.&lt;ref name="grigoreantrop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="centereducation"&gt;[http://www.cedu.ro/programe/improvedu/res/program%20book.pdf ''Improving Education for Roma Children''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926101659/http://www.cedu.ro/programe/improvedu/res/program%20book.pdf |date=2007-09-26 }}, hosted by the [http://www.cedu.ro/despprofen.php Center Education 2000+] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827025646/http://www.cedu.ro/despprofen.php |date=2007-08-27 }}, retrieved June 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The bears were taught to make dancing moves to a [[tambourine]],&lt;ref name="rombasecarneys"/&gt;&lt;ref name="giurescu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="centereducation"/&gt; or trained to walk upright and perform tricks such as leaning on canes and rolling over.&lt;ref name="rombasecarneys"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sendreazbacau"/&gt; The use of iron rods and [[Nose ring (animals)|nose rings]] in the taming process, as well as other such practices, rose attention from [[animal welfare]] advocates, and have been the subject of criticism from as early as the 1920s, when [[Germany]] forbade the Ursari's trade.&lt;ref name="rombasecarneys"/&gt; It has been reported that bear training involved burning the paws of cubs to the rhythm of music.&lt;ref name="fonseca182"&gt;Fonseca, p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early stages of [[World War II]], as part of the repressive measures ordered by the [[Iron Guard]], the [[List of Romanian Ministers of the Interior|Minister of the Interior]] of the [[National Legionary State|Romanian Legionary Government]], [[Constantin Petrovicescu]], passed an order preventing Ursari from performing with bears in cities, towns, or villages.&lt;ref name="petcut"&gt;{{ro icon}} Petre Petcuţ, [http://www.idee.ro/holocaust/pdf/rromilor.pdf ''Samudaripenul (Holocaustul) rromilor în România''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710135029/http://www.idee.ro/holocaust/pdf/rromilor.pdf |date=2007-07-10 }}, at [http://www.idee.ro/ Idee Communication] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206012752/http://www.idee.ro/ |date=2012-02-06 }}, retrieved June 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The official explanation for the measure was that such patterns of movement were helping to spread [[typhus]].&lt;ref name="petcut"/&gt; Over the following years, under [[Ion Antonescu]]'s regime, members of the Ursari community were among the Roma people deported to [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]], as part of [[Holocaust in Romania|Romania's share in the Holocaust]] (''see also [[Romania during World War II]] and [[Porajmos]]'').&lt;ref name="romiiromania"/&gt;&lt;ref name="petcut"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fonseca, p.149&lt;/ref&gt;

Interdictions on performing with bears were legislated throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]].&lt;ref name="rombasecarneys"/&gt; In [[Communist Romania]], large groups of Ursari performers were prevented from entering cities,&lt;ref name="sendreazbacau"/&gt; and, under both [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] and [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], nomadic Roma were subject to settlement policies&lt;ref name="romiiromania"/&gt;&lt;ref name="flesner"&gt;{{ro icon}} Margareta Fleşner, Ioaneta Vintileanu, [http://www.edrc.ro/docs/docs/politia/047-094.pdf "Conflictele locale din judeţul Giurgiu şi implicarea forţelor de poliţie"], in Ioaneta Vintileanu, Gábor Ádám, [http://www.edrc.ro/docs/docs/politia/001-018.pdf ''Poliţia şi comunităţile multiculturale din România''], hosted by [http://www.edrc.ro/ Centrul de Resurse pentru Diversitate Etnoculturală], retrieved June 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fonseca150"&gt;Fonseca, p.150&lt;/ref&gt; (many were reportedly resettled as early as their return from Transnistria).&lt;ref name="fonseca150"/&gt;

===Post-Communism===

In April–June 1991, following the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Revolution of 1989]], Ursari in several localities of Romania's [[Giurgiu County]] &amp;mdash; [[Bolintin Deal]], [[Ogrezeni]] and [[Bolintin Vale]] &amp;mdash; were the target of ethnic violence. Ursari people were chased away, and many of their lodgings were burned to the ground.&lt;ref name="flesner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fonseca, p.148-155&lt;/ref&gt; In Bolintin Deal, where the first such actions took place, this came in retaliation for the murder of a Romanian student, Cristian Melinte, by a young Ursar [[Hitchhiking|hitchhiker]] who was later sentenced to 20 years in prison.&lt;ref name="romiiromania"/&gt;&lt;ref name="flesner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="barascu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Magda Bărăscu, [http://www.euractiv.ro/uniunea-europeana/articles%7CdisplayArticle/articleID_2822/Romii-din-Bolintin-vineaza-fondurile-UE.html  "Romii din Bolintin vînează fondurile UE"], in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', April 20, 2005, hosted by [http://www.euractiv.ro/index.html Euractiv.ro] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622164343/http://www.euractiv.ro/index.html |date=2007-06-22 }}; retrieved June 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fonseca, p.150-151&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[arson]]s were carried out by large groups of local inhabitants, who, according to [[United States|American]] author [[Isabel Fonseca]], acted methodically (they are alleged to have cut down the electrical wires leading to each Ursari house, so that the fire would be contained).&lt;ref&gt;Fonseca, p.152&lt;/ref&gt; In Ogrezeni, inter-communal violence was caused by the stabbing of a Romanian during a bar fight.&lt;ref name="romiiromania"/&gt;&lt;ref name="flesner"/&gt; In contrast, the violent acts in Bolintin Vale were unprovoked, and probably came as an effect of the Ogrezeni incident.&lt;ref name="flesner"/&gt;

Commentators have attributed these outbursts to the failure of settlement measures,&lt;ref name="flesner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fonseca154"&gt;Fonseca, p.154&lt;/ref&gt; with the perception that former nomads were among the privileged class during Communist times.&lt;ref name="fonseca154"/&gt; It was reported that many Romanians in Bolintin Deal believed the Ursari were stealing property and even, in Fonseca's account, that they had been organizing [[photo op]]s for Ceauşescu.&lt;ref&gt;Fonseca, p.153-154&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, criminal acts among the Ursari have been independently reported: among the Roma present in Bolintin Deal, the largely [[Unemployment|unemployed]] Ursari were not fully integrated; it was indicated that houses of non-Ursari Roma were not targeted during the 1991 events, and that, of the 27 criminal files instrumented in Bolintin between 1989 and 1991, 18 implicated Ursari people (with similar ratios in Ogrezeni).&lt;ref name="flesner"/&gt; It was also noted that the Bolintin Deal and Bolintin Vale mobs comprised not only Romanians, but also Roma belonging to traditionally settled communities.&lt;ref name="flesner"/&gt;

[[Romanian Police]] was criticized for its failure to intervene and prevent violence, despite being made aware of the potential for conflict&lt;ref name="flesner"/&gt; &amp;mdash; in Bolintin Deal, 22 out of 26 Ursari houses were burned before the [[Jandarmeria Română|Jandarmeria]] and fire service dispersed the mob.&lt;ref name="romiiromania"/&gt;&lt;ref name="flesner"/&gt; However, in Ogrezeni and Bolintin Vale, Police forces were themselves faced with violence from the mob, after allegations that they had vested interest in supporting the Roma community at large;&lt;ref name="flesner"/&gt; in Ogrezeni, 13 or 14 out of 15 Ursari houses were set on fire, and 11 were devastated in Bolintin Vale.&lt;ref name="romiiromania"/&gt;&lt;ref name="flesner"/&gt;

All members of the Ursari community in Bolintin Deal settled in either [[Bucharest]] or [[Giurgiu]], many of them after selling their plots of land; a group attempted to return in May 1991, but was chased away by the locals.&lt;ref name="romiiromania"/&gt;&lt;ref name="flesner"/&gt; Reportedly, authorities informed the Ursari that they had better to run away.&lt;ref name="romiiromania"/&gt; By 2005, several Ursari who had taken residence in [[Sector 4 (Bucharest)|Bucharest Sector 4]] requested to be issued [[deed]]s for formerly state-owned land in Bolintin Deal, which was then being allocated to residents; the local authorities denied their request, arguing that ownership of the land in question was still subject to dispute, and indicating that the Ursari could purchase other plots if they chose to do so.&lt;ref name="barascu"/&gt;

Despite measures taken against bear training and busking, these remained popular in countries of the Bloc, and Ursari were a seasonal presence on the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast|Black Sea Coast]] under the [[History of Communist Bulgaria|Bulgarian Communist regime]].&lt;ref name="fonseca182"/&gt; Though much rarer, bear leading is still practiced by nomadic groups of Ursari in various areas of Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="patrin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rombasecarneys"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fonseca182"/&gt;

As an aspect of their trade, the Ursari have established and encouraged various folk beliefs and customs involving the bear; these include displaying bears in the courtyards of village houses as a means to protect livestock from attack by smaller wild animals, and ''călcătura ursului'' ("the bear step") or ''călcătura lui Moş Martin'' ("Old Boy Martin's step", based on a common nickname for the animal), which involves allowing bears to tread on a person's back (in the belief that it can ensure the fertility of young people or chase away evil spirits).&lt;ref name="grigoreantrop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="centereducation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=c%C4%83lc%C3%A1&amp;source=12 călcá]'' in [[Alexandru Ciorănescu]], ''Dicţionarul etimologic român'', [[Universidad de la Laguna]], Tenerife, 1958-1966; retrieved September 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter custom was very popular among Romanians, who viewed it as a [[Home remedy|folk remedy]] for [[back pain]]; welcoming Ursari into one's household to perform the task formed part of a string of events leading to the celebration of [[Easter]], or part of customs ushering in [[Christmas]] and the [[New Year's Eve]].&lt;ref name="sendreazbacau"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Costin Anghel, [http://old.jurnalul.ro/articol_47473/vechi_datini_populare.html "Vechi datini populare"], in ''[[Jurnalul Naţional]]'', March 6, 2006; retrieved June 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the members of the Ursari community who manufactured objects of bone, it became widespread to treat the material with [[bear fat]], a [[luxury good]] which, they believed, helped make the products in question more durable.&lt;ref name="grigoreantrop"/&gt; The fat was also being sold to Romanians as medicine to combat [[rheumatism]] and [[List of skeletal disorders|skeletal disorders]], together with bear hairs that were a popular [[amulet]].&lt;ref name="sendreazbacau"/&gt;

The practices associated with bear training have again been the focus of [[animal welfare]] groups ever since the 1990s, and were subject to an adverse campaign in ''[[The International Herald Tribune]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fonseca, p.180&lt;/ref&gt; While noting the use of crude methods of training, [[Isabel Fonseca]], who visited the Ursari in places such as [[Bolintin Deal]] and [[Stara Zagora Province]], argued that, as the main bread-winners for Ursari families, bears were also the recipients of care, attention, and proper feeding.&lt;ref name="fonseca182"/&gt;

Several artists have portrayed Romani bear trainers and their animals in their work. Among them are the Romanian painter and graphic artist [[Theodor Aman]] and the [[United States|American]] sculptor [[Paul Wayland Bartlett]] (whose 1888 ''Bohemian Bear Tamer'' [[Bronze sculpture|bronze]] is on display at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]]).

While, ever since the 1850s, many Ursari musicians have contributed to ''[[Lăutari]]'' culture to the point where they have grown separated from their original environment,&lt;ref name="grigoreantrop"/&gt; traditional Ursari music survived as a separate genre; fused with [[electronic music]], was popularized in early 21st century Romania by the [[Shukar Collective]] project.&lt;ref name="shokarcollect"&gt;[http://www.shukar-collective.net/SITE%20FINAL/bios.htm Shukar Collective site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630130229/http://www.shukar-collective.net/SITE%20FINAL/bios.htm |date=2007-06-30 }}, retrieved June 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A chant used by Ursari trainers has passed into Romanian folklore as a [[nursery rhyme]]. It includes the lyrics:
{| width="100%"
|- valign="top"
|
Joacă, joacă Moş Martine,&lt;br&gt;
Că-ţi dau pâine cu măsline!&lt;ref name="sendreazbacau"/&gt;
|
Dance, dance Old Boy Martin,&lt;br&gt;
And I shall give you bread and olives!
|
|}

A longer version of it was still being sung by the Ursari in [[Bacău County]] by 2007:
{| width="100%"
|- valign="top"
|
Foaie verde pădureţ,&lt;br&gt;
Urcă ursule pe băţ,&lt;br&gt;
Urcă, urcă tot mai sus,&lt;br&gt;
Că şi miere ţi-am adus.&lt;br&gt;
Joacă, joacă Moş Martine,&lt;br&gt;
Că-ţi dau miere de albine.&lt;br&gt;
Joacă, joacă frumuşel,&lt;br&gt;
Si păşeşte mărunţel.&lt;br&gt;
Saltă, saltă cât mai sus,&lt;br&gt;
Căci stăpânu' ţi s-a dus!&lt;ref name="sendreazbacau"/&gt;
|
Green leaf of [[Malus|crabapple]],&lt;br&gt;
Climb, bear on the stick,&lt;br&gt;
Climb higher and higher still,&lt;br&gt;
For I brought you honey, too.&lt;br&gt;
Dance, dance Old Boy Martin,&lt;br&gt;
For I give you the honey of bees.&lt;br&gt;
Dance, dance nicely,&lt;br&gt;
And take little steps.&lt;br&gt;
Jump, jump, higher and higher,&lt;br&gt;
For your master has gone away!

'''Vikos doctors''' were folk [[Traditional healer|healers]] or practical medical practitioners from the [[Greece|Greek]] area of [[Zagori]] in the 18-19th century.

== Etymology ==
The [[Greek language|Greek]] word [[wikt:ἰατρός|ἰατρός]] (''iatrós'', doctor or healer) is often translated as [[physician]]. Vikos doctors ({{lang-el| βικογιατροί}}) were local doctors practicing a form of [[herbal medicine]] in the 18th and 19th century.

== History ==

The Vikos doctors&lt;ref&gt;Βασίλης Μηνακάκης ‘Ζαγοροχώρια’ (Vasilis Minakakis ‘Zagorochoria’) Explorer, Athens, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; hailed from the area of central [[Zagori]] and particularly from the villages of [[Tsepelovo]], [[Fraggades]], [[Papingo]], [[Skamneli]], [[Koukouli, Ioannina|Koukouli]], [[Monodendri, Ioannina|Monodendri]] and [[Kapesovo]]. They used local herbs to heal ailments of people as well as of livestock. These herbs and parts of some other plants were being collected from the [[Vikos|Vikos gorge]], hence the attribution. They were descendants of an ancient craft who in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period attained great fame. Some even served as advisors in the courts of the [[Ottoman Sultan]]s. One named Paschaloglou from [[Kapesovo]] even became a confidente of four [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultans]]: Abdul Hamit I, Suleiman III, Mustafa IV and Mahmut II.

One of the herbs used was the nightshade ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'' for [[cholic]][[spasm]]s. The drug [[atropine]] has been extracted from this plant which is medicinally used for this purpose to our own day. It is also said that two Vikos doctors, Pantazis Exarchou and Zonias, used fungi to treat infected wounds well before [[penicillin]] was discovered by [[Alexander Fleming]]. Other plants with suspected or known medicinal properties were also in their repertory and grow abundantly in the area, among them the lemon balm ''[[Melissa officinalis]]'', St John’s Wort ''[[Hypericum perforatum]]'', absinth ''[[Artemisia absinthium]]'' and the elder bush ''[[Sambucus nigra]]''

'''''Whip Inflation Now''''' ('''''WIN''''') was a 1974 attempt to spur a [[grassroots]] movement to combat [[inflation]] in the US, by encouraging personal savings and disciplined spending habits in combination with public measures, urged by [[U.S. President]] [[Gerald Ford]]. The campaign was later described as "one of the biggest government public relations blunders ever".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/28/AR2006122801002.html|title=Ford's WIN Buttons Remembered|last=CRUTSINGER|first=MARTIN|date=2006-12-28|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-07-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who supported the mandatory and voluntary measures were encouraged to wear "WIN" buttons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-OMNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QHkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7305%2C4218347|title=WIN buttons in high demand|last=Cormier|first=Frank|date=Oct 10, 1974|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps in hope of evoking in peacetime the kind of solidarity and voluntarism symbolized by the [[V sign#The V for Victory campaign and the victory.2Ffreedom sign|V-campaign]] during [[World War II]].  

==Campaign==

Ford had taken office in August 1974 amidst one of the worst economic crises in US history, marked by high unemployment and inflation rising to 12.3% that year following the [[1973 oil crisis]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a Republican, Ford favored the WIN campaign's emphasis on addressing the problem through voluntary actions of citizens, instead of price restrictions imposed centrally by a [[big government]] bureaucracy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The campaign began in earnest with the establishment by the [[93rd United States Congress|93rd Congress]] of the National Commission on Inflation, which Ford closed with an address to the American people, asking them to send him a list of ten inflation-reducing ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HHgsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0PoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7050%2C5980218|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120717055527/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HHgsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0PoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7050,5980218|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 17, 2012|title=WIN is losing|date=Dec 20, 1974|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=11 January 2010}} &lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later, Ford declared inflation "public enemy number one" before Congress on October 8, 1974, in a speech entitled "Whip Inflation Now", announcing a series of proposals for public and private steps intended to directly affect supply and demand to bring inflation under control. Suggested actions for citizens included [[Carpool|carpooling]], turning down thermostats, and starting their own vegetable gardens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

"WIN" buttons immediately became objects of ridicule; skeptics wore the buttons upside down, explaining that "NIM" stood for "No Immediate Miracles," "Nonstop Inflation Merry-go-round," or "Need Immediate Money."

[[Alan Greenspan]], as the Chairman of the [[Council of Economic Advisors]] during the Ford administration, went along reluctantly with the "Whip Inflation Now" campaign,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but would later recall in his book ''[[The Age of Turbulence]]'' that he was thinking, "This is unbelievably stupid" when the concept was first presented to the [[White House]]. According to historian Yanek Mieczkowski, the public campaign was never meant to be the centerpiece of the anti-inflation program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0-8131-2349-6|page=134|url=https://books.google.com/?id=m2JyHO1vNOEC&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=Russell%20Freeburg%20Whip%20inflation%20now&amp;pg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q=|accessdate=|author=Yanek Mieczkowski|year=2005|publisher=Univ.
