      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7944">In [[medicine]], describing a [[disease]] as '''acute''' [[denotation|denotes]] that it is of short [[wikt:duration#Noun|duration]] and, as a [[corollary]] of that, of recent [[wikt:onset#Noun|onset]]. The [[quantification (science)|quantitation]] of how much time constitutes "short" and "recent" varies by disease and by context, but the core denotation of "acute" is always [[qualitative property|qualitatively]] in contrast with "[[chronic condition|chronic]]", which denotes long-lasting disease (for example, in [[acute leukaemia]] and [[chronic leukaemia]]). In addition, "acute" also often [[connotation|connotes]] two other meanings: [[wikt:sudden#Adjective|sudden]] onset and [[wikt:severe#Adjective|severity]], such as in [[myocardial infarction|acute myocardial infarction]] (AMI), where suddenness and severity are both established aspects of the meaning. It thus often connotes that the condition is [[fulminant]] (as in the AMI example), but not always (as in acute [[rhinitis]], which is usually [[synonym]]ous with the [[common cold]]). The one thing that acute MI and acute rhinitis have in common is that they are not chronic. They can happen again (as in recurrent [[pneumonia]], that is, multiple acute pneumonia episodes), but they are not the same [[wikt:case#Noun|case]] ongoing for months or years (unlike [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], which is).

A [[mass noun|noncount]] sense of "acute disease" refers to the acute phase, that is, a short course, of any disease entity.&lt;ref name=pain2007&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Robert F. Schmidt |editor2=William D. Willis |title=Encyclopedia of pain|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-29805-2|page=Acute Pain, Subacute Pain and Chronic Pain (Chapter.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mosby1998&gt;{{cite book|editor=Kenneth N. Anderson|title=Mosby's medical dictionary : illustrated in full colour throughout|year=1998|publisher=Mosby|location=St. Louis|isbn=0815146310|edition=5th revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in an article on ulcerative [[enteritis]] in [[poultry]], the author says, "in acute disease there may be increased [[mortality rate|mortality]] without any obvious [[medical sign|signs]]",&lt;ref name="isbn_9780702028625"&gt;{{Citation |last=Pattison |first=Mark |year=2008 |title=Poultry Diseases |edition=6th |page=207 |isbn=9780702028625 |publisher=Saunders/Elsevier |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the acute form or phase of ulcerative enteritis.

== Meaning variations ==
Not all acute diseases or injuries are severe, and vice versa. For example, a mild [[stubbed toe]] is an acute injury. Similarly, many [[acute upper respiratory infections]] and [[acute gastroenteritis]] cases in adults are mild and usualln of several diseases, such as [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]], [[acute leukaemia]], [[acute myocardial infarction]], and [[acute hepatitis]]. This is often to distinguish diseases from their chronic forms, such as [[chronic leukaemia]], or to highlight the sudden onset of the disease, such as acute myocardial infarct.&lt;ref name="Mosby1998" /&gt;

[[Bhutan]] set up the program for the deaf in a hearing school in [[Thimbu]] ca. 2000, and the first dedicated school, in [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]], was approved in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallaudet.edu/news/bhutan_.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of government funding for deaf education includes developing '''Bhutanese Sign Language''' as the language of instruction.  Development includes at least creating vocabulary for technical subjects,&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgem.co.tz/showthread.php?t=938]&lt;/ref&gt; and deciding on which regional signs to use where they differ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deaftoday.com/news/archives/2003/05/bhutan_to_begin.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not clear if there are multiple sign languages in Bhutan, or merely local differences in vocabulary.  It is unknown whether Bhutanese Sign Language is related to the [[Indian Sign Language|Indian]] or [[Nepali Sign Language|Nepali]] sign languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joshuaproject.net/profiles/text/t19007_in.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Страшный суд.jpg|thumb|The [[Last Judgement]] by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]].]]
The [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] of [[white]] and [[black]] ([[light]] and [[darkness]], [[day]] and [[night]]) has a long tradition of [[metaphor]]ical usage, traceable to the [[Ancient Near East]], and explicitly in the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] ''[[Table of Opposites]]''.
In [[Western culture]] as well as in [[Confucianism]], the contrast symbolizes the moral dichotomy of [[good and evil]].

== Description ==

Day, Light, and Good are often linked together, in opposition to night, darkness, and evil. These contrasting metaphors may go back as far as human history, and appear in many cultures, including both the ancient Chinese and the ancient Persians. The philosophy of [[neoplatonism]] is strongly imbued with the metaphor of goodness as light.&lt;ref name=arnheim&gt;[[Rudolf Arnheim]]. (1974). Art and visual perception. Univ of California Press. "The Symbolism of Light" (pp. 324-5)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Religion and mythology ===

* The [[Genesis creation narrative]] has God "separate light from darkness" on the First Day.

*The Bible associates light with God, truth, and virtue; darkness is associated with sin and the Devil. Painters such as [[Rembrandt]] portrayed divine light illuminating an otherwise dark world.&lt;ref name="arnheim" /&gt;
*''[[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]'', part of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].
*The [[underworld]] ([[Hades]], [[Tartarus]]) was imagined as a [[chthonic]] place of darkness, contrasting with the [[Heaven|celestial]] realm of the [[gods]]. Christian notions of [[heaven]] and [[hell]] inherit this conception, as do the "[[fallen angel|dark angel]]s" vs. the unfallen [[angels]], often with [[aureola]] ([[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]]), in [[Christian mythology]].
*Day and night are personified as deities in various [[mythology|mythologies]] (i.e. [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[Dagr]] and [[Nótt]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Hemera]] and [[Nyx]], et cetera).

=== Dress ===

* White often represents purity or innocence in Western culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The [[Encyclopedia Americana]]: A Library of Universal Knowledge|publisher=Encyclopedia Americana Corp.|year=1918|page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly as white clothing or objects can be stained easily.  In most Western countries white is the color worn by brides at weddings.  [[Angels]] are typically depicted as clothed in white robes.
**In many [[Western (genre)|Hollywood Westerns]], bad cowboys wear [[black and white hat symbolism in film|black hats]] while the good ones wear white. 
**[[Melodrama]] villains are dressed in black and heroines in white dresses. 
**This can be reversed as a deliberate play on conventions, by having the evil character dress in white, as a symbol of their hypocrisy or arrogance.  For example, Don Fanucci in ''[[The Godfather, Part II]]'' is an evil character, but wears an expensive all-white suit as a sign of his esteem, power and prestige. Sometimes protagonists can wear black too, as in ''[[Return of the Jedi]],'' wherein [[Luke Skywalker]] wears black during the final battle.
**In [[computer security]], a [[Black hat hacking|black hat]] is an attacker with evil intentions, while a [[white hat (computer security)|white hat]] bears no such ill will.  (This is derived from the Western movie convention.)

=== Magic ===
* Healing or "good" paranormal magic is called [[magic (paranormal)|White magic]]. [[Black magic]] is a destructive or evil form of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].
** ''[[A Treatise on White Magic]]'' is a book by [[Alice Bailey]], a [[Neo-Theosophy|Theosophist]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''A Treatise on White Magic'' New York: 1934 Lucis Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[White witch]].
** Evil [[witches]] are stereotypically dressed in black and good [[fairies]] in white.

=== Popular Culture ===
* The [[Inventio#Topoi|topos]] of "light and darkness" is also reflected in numerous titles in popular culture, such as ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899), ''[[Light in My Darkness]]'' (1927), ''[[Darkness and the Light]]'' (1942), ''[[Creatures of Light and Darkness]]'' (1969), ''[[From Darkness to Light]]'' (1973), ''[[Darkness and Light (novel)|Darkness and Light]]'' (1989), ''[[The Lord of the Light and of the Darkness]]'' (1993), the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space 9]]'' episode "[[The Darkness and the Light (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|The Darkness and the Light]]" (1997), the ''[[Babylon 5]]'' episode "[[Between the Darkness and the Light]]" (1997), and ''[[Out of the Darkness, Into the Light]]'' (1998).
* In works of [[fantasy]] fiction, the main antagonist is often called a "[[Dark Lord (fiction)|Dark Lord]]", for example Sauron in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.
* [[George Orwell]] makes a bitterly ironic use of the "light and darkness" topos in his ''[[Nineteen Eighty Four]]''. In the early part of the book the protagonist gets a promise that "We will meet in the place where there is no darkness" – which he interprets as referring to a place where the oppressive totalitarian state does not rule. But the man who made the promise was in fact an agent of the [[Thought Police]] – and they eventually meet as prisoner and interrogator where there is indeed no darkness, in detention cells where the light remains on permanently, day and night, as an additional means of torturing detainees.

=== Other Examples ===
* The [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] vs. the [[Age of Enlightenment]].
* "[[False dilemma#Black-and-white thinking|Black and white thinking]]" is the [[false dichotomy]] of assuming anything not good is evil and vice versa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14023">In [[formal language theory]], a  '''context-free language''' ('''CFL''') is a [[formal language|language]] generated by a [[context-free grammar]] (CFG).

Context-free languages have many applications in [[programming languages]], in particular, most arithmetic expressions are generated by context-free grammars.

==Background==

===Context-free grammar===

Different context-free grammars can generate the same context-free language. Intrinsic properties of the language can be distinguished from extrinsic properties of a particular grammar by comparing multiple grammars that describe the language.

===Automata===

The set of all context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by [[pushdown automata]], which makes these languages amenable to parsing. Further, for a given CFG, there is a direct way to produce a pushdown automaton for the grammar (and thereby the corresponding language), though going the other way (producing a grammar given an automaton) is not as direct.

==Examples==

A model context-free language is &lt;math&gt;L = \{a^nb^n:n\geq1\}&lt;/math&gt;, the language of all non-empty even-length strings, the entire first halves of which are {{mvar|a}}'s, and the entire second halves of which are {{mvar|b}}'s. {{mvar|L}} is generated by the grammar &lt;math&gt;S\to aSb ~|~ ab&lt;/math&gt;.
This language is not [[regular language|regular]].
It is accepted by the [[pushdown automaton#Formal definition|pushdown automaton]] &lt;math&gt;M=(\{q_0,q_1,q_f\}, \{a,b\}, \{a,z\}, \delta, q_0, z, \{q_f\})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is defined as follows:&lt;ref group=note&gt;meaning of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;'s arguments and results: &lt;math&gt;\delta(\mathrm{state}_1, \mathrm{read}, \mathrm{pop}) = (\mathrm{state}_2, \mathrm{push})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\delta(q_0, a, z) &amp;= (q_0, az) \\
\delta(q_0, a, a) &amp;= (q_0, aa) \\
\delta(q_0, b, a) &amp;= (q_1, \varepsilon) \\
\delta(q_1, b, a) &amp;= (q_1, \varepsilon) \\
\delta(q_1, \varepsilon, z) &amp;= (q_f, \varepsilon)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Unambiguous CFLs are a proper subset of all CFLs: there are [[Inherently ambiguous language|inherently ambiguous]] CFLs. An example of an inherently ambiguous CFL is the union of &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^m c^m d^n | n, m &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^n c^m d^m | n, m &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt;. This set is context-free, since the union of two context-free languages is always context-free. But there is no way to unambiguously parse strings in the (non-context-free) subset &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^n c^n d^n | n &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt; which is the intersection of these two languages.{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=100|loc=Theorem 4.7}}

===Dyck language===

The [[Dyck language|language of all properly matched parentheses]] is generated by the grammar &lt;math&gt;S\to SS ~|~ (S) ~|~ \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==

===Context-free parsing===
{{main|Parsing}}

The context-free nature of the language makes it simple to parse with a pushdown automaton.

Determining an instance of the [[membership problem]]; i.e. given a string &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, determine whether &lt;math&gt;w \in L(G)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the language generated by a given grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;; is also known as ''recognition''. Context-free recognition for [[Chomsky normal form]] grammars was shown by Leslie G. Valiant to be reducible to boolean [[matrix multiplication]], thus inheriting its complexity upper bound of [[Big O notation|''O'']](''n''&lt;sup&gt;2.3728639&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport| author=Leslie Valiant| title=General context-free recognition in less than cubic time|date=Jan 1974| pages=11| institution=Carnegie Mellon University| url=http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2751&amp;context=compsci}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Leslie G. Valiant| title=General context-free recognition in less than cubic time| journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences| year=1975| volume=10| number=2| pages=308–315| doi=10.1016/s0022-0000(75)80046-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;In Valiant's papers, ''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2.81&lt;/sup&gt;) given, the then best known upper bound. See [[Matrix multiplication#Algorithms for efficient matrix multiplication]] and [[Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm]] for bound improvements since then.&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, Lillian Lee has shown ''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3−ε&lt;/sup&gt;) boolean matrix multiplication to be reducible to ''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3−3ε&lt;/sup&gt;) CFG parsing, thus establishing some kind of lower bound for the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Lillian Lee| title=Fast Context-Free Grammar Parsing Requires Fast Boolean Matrix Multiplication| journal=J ACM| year=2002| volume=49| number=1| pages=1–15| url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/papers/bmmcfl-jacm.pdf| doi=10.1145/505241.505242| arxiv=cs/0112018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical uses of context-free languages require also to produce a derivation tree that exhibits the  structure that the grammar associates with the given string. The process of producing this tree is called ''[[parsing]]''. Known parsers have a time complexity that is cubic in the size of the string that is parsed.

Formally, the set of all context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by pushdown automata (PDA). Parser algorithms for context-free languages include the [[CYK algorithm]] and [[Earley parser|Earley's Algorithm]].

A special subclass of context-free languages are the [[deterministic context-free language]]s which are defined as the set of languages accepted by a [[deterministic pushdown automaton]] and can be parsed by a [[LR parser|LR(k) parser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Knuth | first1 = D.

See also [[parsing expression grammar]] as an alternative approach to grammar and parser.

===Closure===
Context-free languages are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the following operations. That is, if ''L'' and ''P'' are context-free languages, the following languages are context-free as well:
*the [[union (set theory)|union]] &lt;math&gt;L \cup P&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' and ''P''{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=131|loc=Corollary of Theorem 6.1}}
*the reversal of ''L''{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=142|loc=Exercise 6.4d}}
*the [[concatenation]] &lt;math&gt;L \cdot P&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' and ''P''{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=131|loc=Corollary of Theorem 6.1}}
*the [[Kleene star]] &lt;math&gt;L^*&lt;/math&gt; of ''L''{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=131|loc=Corollary of Theorem 6.1}}
*the image &lt;math&gt;\varphi(L)&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' under a [[String operations#String homomorphism|homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=131-132|loc=Corollary of Theorem 6.2}}
*the image &lt;math&gt;\varphi^{-1}(L)&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' under an [[String operations#String homomorphism|inverse homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=132|loc=Theorem 6.3}}
*the [[circular shift#Applications|circular shift]] of ''L'' (the language &lt;math&gt;\{vu : uv \in L \}&lt;/math&gt;){{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=142-144|loc=Exercise 6.4c}}
*the prefix closure of ''L'' (the set of all [[Prefix (computer science)|prefix]]es of strings from ''L''){{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=142|loc=Exercise 6.4b}}
*the [[Quotient of a formal language|quotient]] ''L''/''R'' of ''L'' by a regular language ''R''{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=142|loc=Exercise 6.4a}}

====Nonclosure under intersection, complement, and difference====
The context-free languages are not closed under intersection.  This can be seen by taking the languages &lt;math&gt;A = \{a^n b^n c^m \mid m, n \geq 0 \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B = \{a^m b^n c^n \mid m,n \geq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, which are both context-free.&lt;ref group=note&gt;A context-free grammar for the language ''A'' is given by the following production rules, taking ''S'' as the start symbol: ''S'' → ''Sc'' | ''aTb'' | ''ε''; ''T'' → ''aTb'' | ''ε''. The grammar for ''B'' is analogous.&lt;/ref&gt; Their intersection is &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \{ a^n b^n c^n \mid n \geq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, which can be shown to be non-context-free by the [[pumping lemma for context-free languages]]. As a consequence, context-free languages cannot be closed under complementation, as for any languages ''A'' and ''B'', their intersection can be expressed by union and complement:  &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \overline{\overline{A} \cup \overline{B}} &lt;/math&gt;. In particular, context-free language cannot be closed under difference, since complement can be expressed by difference: &lt;math&gt;\overline{L} = \Sigma^* \setminus L&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Scheinberg.1960"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82210847.pdf | author=Stephen Scheinberg | title=Note on the Boolean Properties of Context Free Languages | journal=Information and Control | volume=3 | number= | pages=372&amp;ndash;375 | month= | year=1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, if ''L'' is a context-free language and ''D'' is a regular language then both their intersection &lt;math&gt;L\cap D&lt;/math&gt; and their difference &lt;math&gt;L\setminus D&lt;/math&gt; are context-free languages.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Decidability===
In formal language theory, questions about regular languages are usually decidable, but ones about context-free languages are often not. It is decidable whether such a language is finite, but not whether it contains every possible string, is regular, is unambiguous, or is equivalent to a language with a different grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1138|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following problems are [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] for arbitrarily given [[context-free grammar]]s A and B:
*Equivalence: is &lt;math&gt;L(A)=L(B)&lt;/math&gt;?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=203|loc=Theorem 8.12(1)}}
*Disjointness: is &lt;math&gt;L(A) \cap L(B) = \emptyset &lt;/math&gt; ?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=202|loc=Theorem 8.10}} However, the intersection of a context-free language and a ''regular'' language is context-free,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Salomaa|1973}}, p. 59, Theorem 6.7&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=135|loc=Theorem 6.5}} hence the variant of the problem where ''B'' is a regular grammar is decidable (see "Emptiness" below).
*Containment: is &lt;math&gt;L(A) \subseteq L(B)&lt;/math&gt; ?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=203|loc=Theorem 8.12(2)}} Again, the variant of the problem where ''B'' is a regular grammar is decidable,{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} while that where ''A'' is regular is generally not.{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=203|loc=Theorem 8.12(4)}}
*Universality: is &lt;math&gt;L(A)=\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; ?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=203|loc=Theorem 8.11}}

The following problems are ''decidable'' for arbitrary context-free languages:
*Emptiness: Given a context-free grammar ''A'', is &lt;math&gt;L(A) = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; ?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=137|loc=Theorem 6.6(a)}}
*Finiteness: Given a context-free grammar ''A'', is &lt;math&gt;L(A)&lt;/math&gt; finite?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=137|loc=Theorem 6.6(b)}}
*Membership: Given a context-free grammar ''G'', and  a word &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, does &lt;math&gt;w \in L(G)&lt;/math&gt; ? Efficient polynomial-time algorithms for the membership problem are the [[CYK algorithm]] and [[Earley parser|Earley's Algorithm]].

According to Hopcroft, Motwani, Ullman (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John E. Hopcroft |author2=Rajeev Motwani |author3=Jeffrey D. Ullman | title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation| year=2003| publisher=Addison Wesley}} Here: Sect.7.6, p.304, and Sect.9.7, p.411&lt;/ref&gt; 
many of the fundamental closure and (un)decidability properties of context-free languages were shown in the 1961 paper of Bar-Hillel, Perles, and Shamir&lt;ref name="Bar-Hillel.Perles.Shamir.1961"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Yehoshua Bar-Hillel |author2=Micha Asher Perles |author3=Eli Shamir | title=On Formal Properties of Simple Phrase-Structure Grammars| journal=Zeitschrift für Phonetik, Sprachwissenschaft und Kommunikationsforschung| year=1961| volume=14| number=2| pages=143–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages that are not context-free===

The set &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^n c^n d^n | n &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[context-sensitive language]], but there does not exist a context-free grammar generating this language.{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}} So there exist context-sensitive languages which are not context-free. To prove that a given language is not context-free, one may employ the [[pumping lemma for context-free languages]]&lt;ref name="Bar-Hillel.Perles.Shamir.1961"/&gt; or a number of other methods, such as [[Ogden's lemma]] or [[Parikh's theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/265/how-to-prove-that-a-language-is-not-context-free How to prove that a language is not context-free?]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Darruder.jpeg|thumb|250px|The [[War in the Vendée]] was a royalist uprising that was suppressed by the republican forces in 1796.]]
A '''counter-revolutionary''' or '''anti-revolutionary''' is anyone who opposes a [[revolution]], particularly those who act after a revolution to try to overturn or reverse it, in full or in part.&lt;ref name="VerhoevenJohnson2017"&gt;{{cite book|title=Anti-Jacobin Novels, Part I|date=29 September 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|language=English|isbn=9781351223331|page=64|author=W M Verhoeven, Claudia L Johnson, Philip Cox, Amanda Gilroy, Robert Miles}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective, "counter-revolutionary", pertains to movements that would restore the state of affairs, or the principles, that prevailed during a prerevolutionary era.

A counter-revolution can be positive or negative in its consequences; depending, in part, on the beneficent or pernicious character of the revolution that gets reversed, and the nature of those affected.  For example, the transitory success of [[Agis IV|Agis]] and [[Cleomenes III|Cleomenes]] of ancient Sparta in restoring the constitution of [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]] was considered by [[Plutarch]] to be counter-revolutionary in a positive sense.  During the French Revolution the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] saw the [[Revolt in the Vendée|Counter-revolution in the Vendée]] as distinctly negative, whilst it was strongly supported by the exiled Royalists, the Catholic Church, and the people of the provinces.

== England, France and elsewhere ==
{{Toryism}}
In some ways, the supporters of [[Jacobitism]] may be placed in this category.  The Jacobites were supporters of the Stuart house's claim to the English throne since 1688.  The Jacobites survive to this day in their support for the Stuart family's claim to the English throne.

The word "counter-revolutionary" originally referred to thinkers who opposed themselves to the 1789 [[French Revolution]], such as [[Joseph de Maistre]], [[Louis Gabriel Ambroise de Bonald|Louis de Bonald]] or, later, [[Charles Maurras]], the founder of the ''[[Action française]]'' monarchist movement. More recently, it has been used in France to describe political movements that reject the legacy of the 1789 Revolution, which historian [[René Rémond]] has referred to as ''[[légitimistes]]''. Thus, [[monarchist]] supporters of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' following the [[French Revolution]] were counter-revolutionaries, for example supporters of the [[Revolt in the Vendée]] and of the monarchies that put down the various [[Revolutions of 1848]]. The royalist [[legitimist]] counter-revolutionary French movement survives to this day, albeit marginally. It was active during the purported "''[[Révolution nationale]]''" enacted by [[Vichy France]], though, which has been considered by René Rémond not as a [[fascist]] regime but as a counter-revolutionary regime, whose motto was ''Travail, Famille, Patrie'' ("Work, Family, Fatherland"), which replaced the [[Republicanism|Republican]] motto ''[[Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité]]''.

After the French Revolution, anti-clerical policies and the execution of King Louis XVI led to the [[Revolt in the Vendee]].  This counter-revolution produced what is debated to be the first modern genocide. Monarchists and Catholics took up arms against the revolutionaries' French Republic in 1793 after the government asked that 300,000 Vendeans be conscripted into the Republican military. The Vendeans would also rise up against Napoleon's attempt to conscript them in 1815.

Many historians have held that the rise and spread of [[Methodism]] in Great Britain prevented the development of a revolution there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobsbawm|first=Eric|year=1957|title=Methodism and the Threat of Revolution in Britain|journal=[[History Today]]|volume=7|issue=5|language=English|quote=Historians have held that religious Revivalism in the late eighteenth century distracted the minds of the English from thoughts of Revolution.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to preaching the Christian Gospel, [[John Wesley]] and his Methodist followers visited those imprisoned, as well as the poor and aged, building hospitals and [[Dispensary|dispensaries]] which provided free healthcare for the masses.&lt;ref name="MaddoxVickers2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maddox|first1=Randy L.|last2=Vickers|first2=Jason E.|title=The Cambridge Companion to John Wesley|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=English |isbn=9780521886536|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist William H. Swatos stated that "Methodist enthusiasm transformed men, summoning them to assert rational control over their own lives, while providing in its system of mutual discipline the psychological security necessary for autonomous conscience and liberal ideals to become internalized, an integrated part of the 'new men' ... regenerated by Wesleyan preaching."&lt;ref name="Swatos1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Swatos|first=William H.|title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Society|year=1998|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Rowman Altamira]]|language=English|isbn=9780761989561|page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of [[temperance movement|temperance]] among Methodists, as well as their rejection of [[Gambling#Religious|gambling]], allowed them to eliminate [[secondary poverty]] and accumulate capital.&lt;ref name="Swatos1998"/&gt; Individuals who attended Methodist chapels and [[Sunday school]]s "took into industrial and political life the qualities and talents they had developed within Methodism and used them on behalf of the working classes in non-revolutionary ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomis|first1=Malcom I.  |last2=Holt|first2=Peter |title=Threats of Revolution in Britain 1789–1848|date=1 December 1977|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|language=English|isbn=9781349158171|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of the Methodist Church in Great Britain, author and professor Michael Hill states, "filled both a social ''and'' an ideological vacuum" in English society, thus "opening up the channels of social and ideological mobility ... which worked against the polarization of English society into rigid social classes."&lt;ref name="Swatos1998"/&gt; The historian [[Bernard Semmel]] argues that "Methodism was an antirevolutionary movement that succeeded (to the extent that it did) because it was a revolution of a radically different kind" that was capable of effecting social change on a large scale.&lt;ref name="Swatos1998"/&gt;

In Italy, after the conquer of the Napoleon's army in the late 18th century, there was a counter-revolution in all the [[French client republic]]s. The most well-known was the [[Sanfedismo]], reactionary movement led by the cardinal [[Fabrizio Ruffo]], which overthrew the [[Parthenopean Republic]] and allowed the [[House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|Bourbon]] dynasty to return to the throne of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. A resurgence of the phenomenon happened during the Napoleon's [[Italian and Swiss expedition|second Italian campaign]] in the early 19th century. Another example of counter-revolution was the peasants rebellion in Southern Italy after the [[Italian unification|national unification]], fomented by the Bourbon government in exile and the [[Papal States]]. The revolt, labelled as [[Brigandage in Southern Italy|brigandage]], resulted in a bloody civil war that lasted almost ten years.

The supporters of [[Carlism]] during the 19th century to the present day are perhaps the oldest surviving counter-revolutionary group in Spain.  Supporters uphold the legitimist view of royal succession, as well as regional autonomy under the monarchy, tradition and Catholicism. The Carlist cause began with the [[First Carlist War]] in 1833 and continues to the present.

The [[White Army]] and its supporters who tried to defeat the [[Bolshevik]]s after the [[October Revolution]], as well as the German politicians, police, soldiers and [[Freikorps]] who crushed the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]], were also counter-revolutionaries. General [[Victoriano Huerta]], and later the [[Felicistas]], attempted to thwart the [[Mexican Revolution]] in the 1910s.

In the late 1920s, Mexican Catholics took up arms against the Mexican Federal Government in what became known as the [[Cristero War]].  The President of Mexico, Plutarco Elias Calles, was elected in 1924. Calles began carrying out anti-Catholic policies which caused peaceful resistance from Catholics in 1926.  The counter-revolution began as a movement of peaceful resistance against the anti-clerical laws. In the Summer of 1926, fighting broke out. The fighters known as Cristeros fought the government due to its suppression of the Church, jailing and execution of priests, formation of a nationalist schismatic church, [[state atheism]], Socialism, Freemasonry and other harsh anti-Catholic policies.

The [[Spanish Civil War]] was in some respects, a counter-revolution. Supporters of [[Carlism]], monarchy, and nationalism (see [[Falange]]) joined forces against the (Second) Spanish Republic in 1936. The counter-revolutionaries saw the Spanish Constitution of 1931 as a revolutionary document that defied Spanish culture, tradition and religion. On the Republican side, the acts of the [[Communist Party of Spain]] against the rural collectives can also be considered counter-revolutionary.

More recently, the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] into [[Cuba]] was conducted by counter-revolutionaries who hoped to overthrow the revolutionary government of [[Fidel Castro]]. In the 1980s, the ''[[Contras|Contra]]-Revolución'' rebels fighting to overthrow the revolutionary [[Sandinista]] government in [[Nicaragua]]. In fact, the Contras received their name precisely because they were counter-revolutionaries.

The [[Black Eagles]], the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]], and other [[paramilitary]] movements of [[Colombia]] can also be seen as counter-revolutionary. These [[right-wing]] groups are opposition to the [[FARC]], and other [[left-wing]] [[guerrilla]] movements.

Some counter-revolutionaries are former [[revolutionary|revolutionaries]] who supported the initial overthrow of the previous regime, but came to differ with those who ultimately came to power after the revolution. For example, some of the Contras originally fought with the Sandinistas to overthrow [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle|Anastasio Somoza]], and some of those who oppose Castro also opposed [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]].

[[Plinio Correa de Oliveira]] has by far expanded on the idea of Revolution and Counter-Revolution.

== China ==
The anti-communist [[Kuomintang]] party in China used the term "counter-revolutionary" to disparage the communists and other opponents of its regime. [[Chiang Kai-shek]], the Kuomintang party leader, was the chief user of this term.

The Kuomintang had several influences left upon its ideology by revolutionary thinking. The Kuomintang, and Chiang Kai-shek used the words "[[feudal]]" and "counter-revolutionary" as synonyms for evil, and backwardness, and proudly proclaimed themselves to be [[revolutionary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IDbvAzXCBH8C&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=Dear+Ah+Feng,+the+Chinese+Revolution+is+yet+to+be+completed.+But+I,+a+revolutionary,+feel+down-hearted+and+am+unable+to+devote+my+full+energy+to+our+country.+I+only+want+you+to+promise+me+one+thing+and+then+I+shall+find+strength+again+to+work+hard+for+the+revolution.&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fTqmTPHmH8L7lwe7lp0Z&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Dear%20Ah%20Feng%2C%20the%20Chinese%20Revolution%20is%20yet%20to%20be%20completed.%20But%20I%2C%20a%20revolutionary%2C%20feel%20down-hearted%20and%20am%20unable%20to%20devote%20my%20full%20energy%20to%20our%20country.%20I%20only%20want%20you%20to%20promise%20me%20one%20thing%20and%20then%20I%20shall%20find%20strength%20again%20to%20work%20hard%20for%20the%20revolution.&amp;f=false|title=Chiang Kai-shek's secret past: the memoir of his second wife, Chʻen Chieh-ju|author=Jieru Chen, Lloyd E.

Chiang also crushed and dominated the merchants of Shanghai in 1927, seizing loans from them, with the threats of death or exile. Rich [[merchants]], [[industrialists]], and [[entrepreneurs]] were arrested by Chiang, who accused them of being "counter-revolutionary", and Chiang held them until they gave money to the Kuomintang. Chiang's arrests targeted rich millionaires, accusing them of communism and counter-revolutionary activities. Chiang also enforced an anti-Japanese boycott, sending his agents to sack the shops of those who sold Japanese made items and fining them. He also disregarded the internationally protected International Settlement, putting cages on its borders in which he threatened to place the merchants.  The Kuomintang's alliance with the [[Green Gang]] allowed it to ignore the borders of the foreign concessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZpVntUTZfkC&amp;dq=I+have+often+thought+that+i+am+the+most+clever+woman+that+ever+lived%2C+and+others+cannot+compare+with+me&amp;q=shanghai+merchants+executed#v=snippet&amp;q=shanghai%20merchants%20chiang%20mercy&amp;f=false|title=The last empress: Madame Chiang Kai-Shek and the birth of modern China|author=Hannah Pakula|year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=|page=160|isbn=1-4391-4893-7|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar term also existed in the [[People's Republic of China]], which includes charges such collaborating with foreign forces and inciting revolts against the government. According to Article 28 of the Chinese constitution, ''The state maintains public order and suppresses treasonable and other counter-revolutionary activities; It penalizes actions that endanger public security and disrupt the socialist economy and other criminal activities, and punishes and reforms criminals.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.people.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html|title=Constitution of the People's Republic Of China (Adopted on December 4, 1982)|publisher=www.people.com.cn|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term received wide usage during the [[Cultural Revolution]], in which thousands of intellectuals and government officials were denounced as "counter-revolutionaries" by the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]]. Following the end of the Cultural Revolution, the term was also used to label [[Lin Biao]] and the [[Gang of Four]].

== Usage of the term ==
The word ''counter-revolutionary'' is often used interchangeably with ''[[reactionary]]''; however, some reactionary people use the term ''counter-revolutionary'' to describe their opponents, even if those opponents were advocates of a revolution. In general, the word "reactionary" is used to describe those who oppose a more long-term trend of social change, while "counter-revolutionaries" are those who oppose a very recent and sudden change.

The clerics who took power following the [[Iranian Revolution]] became ''counter-revolutionaries''; after the revolution the Marxists were driven out of power by the mullahs.  Thousands of political prisoners who opposed the [[Islamist]] regime were killed especially during the [[1988 Massacre of Iranian Prisoners]].

Sometimes it is unclear who represents the revolution and who represents the counter-revolution. In Hungary, the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|1956 uprising]] was condemned as a ''counter-revolution'' by the ruling Communist authorities (who claimed to be revolutionary themselves). However, thirty years later, the events of 1956 were more widely known as a ''revolution''.

{{Quote box
 |quote  = [In Moscow] May Day, 1932, dawned clear and bright... Hour after hour they marched by [in the May Day Parade] ... When not otherwise occupied I have a subconscious habit of counting. It had not been difficult to estimate the number of the military because of the regularity of their formations... I arrived at an approximate total of the paraders. That evening, I dined with friends at the Metropol Hotel. Among them was a new acquaintance, a Communist official. Quite innocently, I asked how many people they estimated had marched in the day's demonstration. Three of the party guessed. Each said a million. I was surprised at such unanimity. "Do you know that three hundred thousand would be a fairly close estimate?" I asked. The atmosphere of the room changed instantly. There was a dead silence of extreme tension. Then, like a whiplash, came the voice of the Communist official. "'''That's counter-revolutionary mathematics'''!" [bolding added]
Startled for an instant, I laughed.
"Mathematics," I said, "is independent of social orders. It is vital to know the truth."
"Truth," sneered the Communist. "You do not understand truth as we do. With you it is only a bourgeois concept. With us it has a different meaning. 'Three hundred thousand' means nothing. When we go before the world and say a million workers marched in Red Square today, that means something. People understand the word 'million.' That is truth, from our point of view!"

'''Credibility gap''' is a term that came into wide use with journalism, political and public discourse in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s. At the time, it was most frequently used to describe public skepticism about the [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] administration's statements and policies on the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="american chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/6883|work=American Chronicle|date=March 15, 2006|title=Happy Anniversary to the first scheduled presidential press conference - 93 years young!|first=Robert|last=Rouse|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913094418/http://www.americanchronicle.com:80/articles/6883|archivedate=September 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in journalism as a euphemism for recognized lies told to the public by politicians. Today, it is used more generally to describe almost any "gap" between an actual situation and what politicians and government agencies say about it.&lt;ref name="Hoh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt;

==History==
The term "credibility gap" came against a background of the use of the term "[[missile gap]]", which the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] lists as first being used by then-Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] on 14 August 1958, when he stated: "Our Nation could have afforded, and can afford now, the steps necessary to close the missile gap."&lt;ref name=kennedy&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Preble|first1=Christopher A.|title="Who Ever Believed in the 'Missile Gap'?": John F. Kennedy and the Politics of National Security|journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly|date=December 2003|volume=33|issue=4|pages=801–826|doi=10.1046/j.0360-4918.2003.00085.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Doomsday gap" and "mineshaft gap" were the imagined post-apocalyptic continuations of this paranoia in the 1964 Cold War satire [[Dr. Strangelove]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove Dr. Strangelove - TV Tropes]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "credibility gap" was widely in use as early as 1963, according to ''Timetables of History''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Timetables of History: A Horizontal Linkage of People and Events|last=Gunn|first=Bernard Grun|edition=4|publisher=Touchstone|year=2005|isbn=9780743270038 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its association with the Vietnam War, in December 1962, at the annual meeting of the U.S. Inter-American Council, Senator [[Kenneth B. Keating]] (R-N.Y.) praised President John F. Kennedy's prompt action in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], but he said there was an urgent need for the United States to plug the "credibility gap" in U.S. policy on Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;(Source: Associated Press article dated December 10, 1962, available online at NewspaperArchive.com.)&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularized in 1966 by [[J. William Fulbright]], a Democratic Senator from Arkansas, when he could not get a straight answer from President Johnson's Administration regarding the war in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/Audio/1966/Vietnam-1966/|work=UPI|title=1966 Year in Review |author=|year=1966|accessdate=April 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Credibility gap" was first used in association with the Vietnam War in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' in March 1965, to describe then-president Lyndon Johnson's handling of the escalation of American involvement in the war. A number of events&amp;mdash;particularly the surprise [[Tet Offensive]], and later the 1971 release of the [[Pentagon Papers]]&amp;mdash;helped to confirm public suspicion that there was a significant "gap" between the administration's declarations of controlled military and political resolution, and the reality. These were viewed as examples of Johnson's and later [[Richard Nixon]]'s duplicity. Throughout the war, Johnson worked with his officials to ensure that his public addresses would only disclose bare details of the war to the American public. During the war the country grew more and more aware of the credibility gap especially after Johnson's speech at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in April 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam and America edited by [[Marvin Gettleman|Marvin E. Gettleman]], Jane Franklin, Marilyn Young and H. Bruce Franklin&lt;/ref&gt; An example of public opinion appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'' concerning the war. "The time has come to call a spade a bloody shovel. This country is in an undeclared and unexplained war in Vietnam. Our masters have a lot of long and fancy names for it, like escalation and retaliation, but it is a war just the same." - James Reston.

The advent of the presence of television journalists allowed by the military to report and photograph events of the war within hours or days of their actual occurrence in an uncensored manner drove the discrepancy widely referred to as "the credibility gap."

==Later usage==
After the Vietnam War, the term "credibility gap" came to be used by political opponents in cases where an actual, perceived or implied discrepancy existed between a politician's public pronouncements and the actual, perceived or implied reality. For example, in the 1970s the term was applied to Nixon's own handling of the Vietnam War&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,876891,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=April 5, 1971|title=Again, the Credibility Gap? |first= |last=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently to the discrepancy between evidence of [[Richard Nixon]]'s complicity in the [[Watergate]] break-in and his repeated claims of innocence.

Since 2017, the has been used to describe the [[Trump administration]], particularly in relation to the use of what [[White House Counsel]] [[Kellyanne Conway]] called [[alternative facts]].&lt;ref name="Hoh"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hohmann|first1=James|title=The Daily 202: It's bigger than Flynn.

== Cross-cultural communication ==

{{main|Cross-cultural communication}}

By the 1970s, the field of [[cross-cultural communication]] (also known as [[intercultural communication]]) developed as a prominent application of the cross-cultural paradigm, in response to the pressures of [[globalization]] which produced a demand for cross-cultural awareness training in various commercial sectors.

Cultural communication differences can be identified by 8 different criteria: 
# when to talk; 
# what to say; 
# pacing and pausing; 
# the art of listening; 
# intonation; 
# what is conventional and what is not in a language; 
# degree of indirectness; and 
# cohesion and coherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tannen|first=Deborah|title=Cross-cultural communication|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED253061&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED253061|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cross-cultural pedagogies ==

The appearance of the term "cross-cultural" in the titles of a number of college readers and writing textbooks beginning in the late 1980s can be attributed to a convergence of academic [[multiculturalism]] and the [[pedagogical]] movement known as [[Writing Across the Curriculum]], which gave educators in the social sciences greater influence in composition [[pedagogy]]. Popular examples included ''Ourselves Among Others: Cross-Cultural Readings for Writers'' (1988), edited by Carol J. Verburg, and ''Guidelines: A Cross Cultural Reading Writing Text'' (1990), ed. Ruth Spack.

==Cross-cultural studies==

Cross-cultural studies is an adaptation of the term ''cross-cultural'' to describe a branch of literary and [[cultural studies]] dealing with works or writers associated with more than one culture.  Practitioners of cross-cultural studies often use the term ''cross-culturalism'' to describe discourses involving cultural interactivity, or to promote (or disparage) various forms of cultural interactivity.

Cross-culturalism is nearly synonymous with [[transculturation]], a term coined by Cuban writer  [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] in the 1940s to describe processes of cultural [[hybridity]] in [[Latin America]].  However, there are certain differences of emphasis reflecting the social science derivation of ''cross-culturalism''.

The term "cross-culturalism" became prevalent in cultural studies in the late 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Trimmer and Tilly Warnock, ''Understanding Others: Cultural and Cross-Cultural Studies and the Teaching of Literature'' Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  An early proponent of the term was the Guyanese writer [[Wilson Harris]], who wrote in ''The Womb of Space'' (1983), that "cultural heterogeneity or cross-cultural capacity" gives an "evolutionary thrust" to the imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson Harris, ''The Womb of Space'' (Westport: Greenwood, 1983): xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson Harris, ''The Unfinished Genesis of the Imagination'', ed. Andrew Bundy.  London/New York: Routledge, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthropology]] exerted a strong influence on the development of cross-culturalism in literary and cultural studies.  French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] was a key figure in the development of [[structuralism]] and its successor, [[post-structuralism]].  Cross-influences between [[anthropology]] and literary/cultural studies in the 1980s were evident in works like [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] and [[George E. Marcus|George Marcus]]'s collection, ''Writing Culture: the Poetics and Politics of Ethnography'' (1986).  Harvard anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] was cited as an influence on literary critics like [[Stephen Greenblatt]], while other literary/cultural scholars turned to works by [[Victor Turner]] and [[Mary Douglas]].

Like multiculturalism, cross-culturalism is sometimes construed as ideological, in that it advocates values such as those associated with [[transculturation]], [[transnationalism]], [[cosmopolitanism]], [[interculturalism]], and [[globalism]].  Nevertheless, cross-culturalism is a fundamentally neutral term, in that favorable portrayal of other cultures or the processes of cultural mixing are not essential to the categorization of a work or writer as cross-cultural.

Cross-culturalism is distinct from [[multiculturalism]].  Whereas [[multiculturalism]] deals with [[cultural diversity]] within a particular nation or social group, cross-culturalism is concerned with exchange beyond the boundaries of the nation or cultural group.

Cross-culturalism in literary and cultural studies is a useful rubric for works, writers and  artists that do not fit within a single cultural tradition.  To the extent that cultures are national, the cross-cultural may be considered as overlapping the [[International|transnational]].  The cross-cultural can also be said to incorporate the [[Colonialism|colonial]] and the [[postcolonial]], since [[colonialism]] is by definition a form of cross-culturalism.  [[Travel literature]] also makes up a substantial component of cross-cultural literature.  Of the various terms, "cross-culturalism" is the most inclusive, since it is free of transnationalism's dependence on the nation-state and colonialism/postcolonialism's restriction to colonized or formerly-colonized regions.  This inclusiveness leads to certain definitional ambiguity (albeit one derived from the term [[culture]] itself).  In practice, "cross-cultural" is usually applied only to situations involving significant cultural divergence.  Thus, the term is not usually applied in cases involving crossing between European nations, or between Europe and the United States.  However, there is no clear reason why, for example, [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]'s ''[[Democracy in America]]'' or even [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (in which the protagonist experiences culture shock after traveling to [[Los Angeles]] from [[New York City]]) could not be considered cross-cultural works.

Although disagreement over what constitutes a "significant" cultural divergence creates difficulties of categorization, "cross-cultural" is nevertheless useful in identifying writers, artists, works, etc., who may otherwise tend to fall between the cracks of various national cultures.

=== Cross-cultural studies in the social sciences ===

{{main|Cross-cultural studies}}

The term "cross-cultural" emerged in the social sciences in the 1930s, largely as a result of the ''Cross-Cultural Survey'' undertaken by [[George Peter Murdock]], a [[Yale]] [[anthropologist]].  Initially referring to [[comparative studies]] based on [[statistical]] compilations of cultural data, the term gradually acquired a secondary sense of cultural interactivity.  The comparative sense is implied in phrases such as "a cross-cultural perspective," "cross-cultural differences," "a cross-cultural study of..." and so forth, while the interactive sense may be found in works like ''Attitudes and Adjustment in Cross-Cultural Contact: Recent Studies of Foreign Students'', a 1956 issue of ''[[Journal of Social Issues|The Journal of Social Issues]]''.  

Usage of "cross-cultural" was for many decades restricted mainly to the [[social sciences]].  Among the more prominent examples are the [[International Association for Cross-Cultural Psychology]] (IACCP), established in 1972 "to further the study of the role of cultural factors in shaping human behavior," and its associated ''[[Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology]]'', which aims to provide an [[interdisciplinary]] discussion of the effects of cultural differences.

A '''double closing''' is the simultaneous purchase and sale of a [[real estate]] property involving three parties: the original seller, an investor (middleman), and the final buyer.

The underlying reasons for having a double closing vary.  The most pressing and usual reason is to allow the middleman to use the purchasers funds to acquire the property from the original seller.  Another common reason for a double closing is to conceal the identity of the purchaser or seller.

Typically, a [[real estate]] investor first enters into a contract to purchase a property and then subsequently (before closing the purchase) enters into a contract to sell the property (hopefully for a higher price).  The investor then utilizes a double closing to close both transactions at approximately the same time.

==The mechanics==
The mechanics of a double closing vary, depending on who the buyer and seller are, who is providing the financing, and who is conducting the closing.  In the simplest form of double closing, the purchaser would pay the purchase monies to the middleman and they would complete a settlement statement ([[HUD-1]]) for their transaction.  The purchaser would have to wait while the middleman uses most of the purchase monies to purchase the property from the seller.  The seller and middleman would also complete a separate settlement statement for their transaction.  The middleman would then instruct the seller to deed the property directly to the purchaser.

To keep the purchaser and seller separate,the closing may be conducted in two different rooms or at two different times or locations. Success is more likely if the closing agent is friendly and accommodating.

To simplify the transaction, the middleman may make one settlement statement directly between the purchaser and seller and take his profit as a line item on the settlement statement.  This line item is usually on the purchaser's side of the statement as an assignment fee.  This may create a problem for the middleman, as assignment fees may be taxed at a different rate than short-term capital gains.

==Legal standpoint==
From a legal standpoint, most sale contracts stipulate that the seller may pay encumbrances out of the proceeds of the sale.  The fact that the original seller still owns the property is definitely an encumbrance. Also, contracts may be assignable, thus allowing the middleman to have the right to assign his purchase contract to the purchaser for a fee.

The '''Dvapara Yuga''', also spelled as '''Dwapara Yuga''', is the third out of four [[Yuga]]s, or ages, described in the scriptures of [[Hinduism]]. Dvapara in Sanskrit literally means "two ahead",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dvapara-yuga]&lt;/ref&gt; that is, something in the third place. The Dvapara Yuga follows the [[Treta Yuga]] and precedes the [[Kali Yuga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yukteswar|first1=Swami Sri|title=The Holy Science|date=1990|publisher=Self-Realization Fellowship|location=Los Angeles, CA|isbn=978-0-87612-051-4|page=9}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 August 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Puranas]], this yuga ended at the moment when [[Krishna]] returned to his eternal abode of [[Vaikuntha]]. According to the [[Bhagavata Purana]], the Dvapara Yuga lasts 864,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Bhāgavata Purāṇa}} 12.2.29-33&lt;/ref&gt;

There are only two pillars of religion during the Dvapara Yuga: compassion and truthfulness. [[Vishnu]] assumes the colour yellow and the [[Vedas]] are categorized into four parts: [[Rig Veda]], [[Sama Veda]], [[Yajur Veda]] and [[Atharva Veda]]. During these times, the Brahmins are knowledgeable of two or three of these but rarely have studied all the four Vedas thoroughly. Accordingly, because of this categorization, different actions and activities come into existence.

==The roles of the classes==
All people in the Dvapara Yuga are desirous of achievement of the scriptural dharma that is prescribed to each class, valiant, courageous and competitive by nature and are engaged only in penance and charity. They are kingly and pleasure-seeking. In this era, the divine intellect ceases to exist, and it is therefore seldom that anyone is wholly truthful. As a result of this life of deceit, people are plagued by ailments, diseases and various types of desires. After suffering from these ailments, people realize their misdeeds and perform penance. Some also organize [[Yajna|Yagya]] for material benefits as well as for divinity.

===Brahmana===
In this Yuga, the Brahmanas are involved in Yagya, self-study and teaching activities. They attain celestial bliss by engaging in penance, religion, control of senses, and restraint.

===Kshatriya===
The duties of [[Kshatriya]]s are the protection of their subjects. In this era, they are humble and perform their duties by controlling their senses. The Kshatriyas honestly execute all policies of law and order without being angry or cruel. They are devoid of injustice towards the ordinary citizens and consequently attain bliss.

The king avails the advice of the learned scholars and accordingly maintains law and order in his empire. The king who is addicted to vices will definitely end up defeated. One or two or all from [[Sāma, Dāna, Danda, Bheda]] and Upeksha is/are brought into use and help attain the desired. Kings are diligent in maintaining public decorum and order.

A few of the kings, however, surreptitiously plan a conspiracy along with the scholars. Strong people execute work where execution of policies is involved. The king appoints priests, etc. to perform religious activities, economists and ministers to perform monetary activities, impotents to take care of women, and cruel men to execute heinous activities.

There are two kshatriya dynasties, namely 'Surya Vansha' and 'Chandra Vansha'.

===Vaishya===
Vaishyas are mostly landowners and merchants. The duties of [[Vaishya]]s are trade and agriculture. Vaishyas attain higher planes through charity and hospitality. [[Krishna]], eighth [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] was brought up in a Vaishya family though he was a born [[Yadav]].

===Sudra===
The duty of [[Shudra|Sudra]]s is to perform tasks that demand highly physical work. vedas say everyone is a born shudra and with their deeds they can become a kshatriya, brahman or vaishya. For political reasons shudras had difficulty going up the ranks unless they were extraordinary. Vidura, the famous Prime Minister of Hastinapura was born in the Sudra community and attained the status of a Brahmin due to his wisdom, righteousness and learning.
Jathi and varna was a horizontal, flexible, dynamic system that built a reasonable harmonious society compared to other civilizations in the world.

==In modern culture==
In 1894, [[Swami Sri Yukteswar]], with his book [[The Holy Science]], broke from Hindu tradition in stating that the earth is not in the age of Kali Yuga, but has advanced to Dwapara Yuga. His proof was based on a new perspective of the precession of the equinoxes, correcting a problem of ''interpretation'' of the ancient texts.

In [[Namco]]'s [[Soul (series)|Soul]] series, [[Kilik]], the wielder of the [[Kali Yuga]] staff, also possess the mirror sash by the same name. In the end of the battle against [[Inferno (Soul Calibur)|Inferno]], he uses the mirror to extinguish the flames. In [[Soulcalibur II]], [[Soulcalibur III]], and [[Soulcalibur IV]] he wears a necklace that includes a piece of the Dvapara Yuga used as a pendant for rituals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6424">'''Egbert Richter''' (also publishing under the [[pen name]] of '''Richter-Ushanas''', after ''{{IAST|[[Ushanas|uśánas]]}}'', a Vedic [[rishi]]) is a German freelance writer and lecturer, author of [[self-published]] (''Egbert Richter Verlag'', registered in [[Bremen]]) treatises on [[Yoga]], [[Vedanta]], [[Esotericism]] and [[mythology]], translations of some [[Upanishads]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] as well as original poetry. Richter has also published various [[pseudo-scholarly]] claims, including decipherment of the [[Rongorongo]], [[Phaistos Disc decipherment claims|Phaistos Disc]] and [[Indus script]]s.

In his 1992 decipherment claim of the Indus script, he argues that the script is "based very largely on intuition, and this quality is also required for reading it", likening the process of "decipherment" to [[meditation]], concluding that the [[Rbhus]], who Richter alleges were priests of the [[Harappan civilization]], invented the Indus script under the influence of [[Sumerian cuneiform]]. [[Karel Werner|Werner]] (1999) confesses himself "at a loss how to evaluate" Richter's work, admitting the author has thorough knowledge of the various sources he uses, but at the same time completely lacks academic method, discipline or experience.

An '''ellipsis''' (plural '''ellipses'''; from the {{lang-grc|ἔλλειψις}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|élleipsis}}, 'omission' or '[[wikt:ellipsis|falling short]]') is a series of dots (typically three, such as "…") that usually indicates an intentional omission of a word, sentence, or whole section from a text without altering its original meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=ellipsis|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ellipsis|journal=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2017}}
The ellipsis is also called a '''suspension point''', '''points of ellipsis''', '''periods of ellipsis''', or ([[colloquialism|colloquially]]) "'''dot-dot-dot'''".&lt;ref name="Toner"&gt;{{cite book |first=Anne |last=Toner |title=Ellipsis in English Literature: Signs of Omission |location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2015 |page=151}} According to Toner it is difficult to establish when the "dot-dot-dot" phrase was first used. There is an early instance, which is perhaps the first in a piece of fiction, in Virginia Woolf's short story "An Unwritten Novel" (1920).&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on their context and placement in a sentence, ellipses can  indicate an unfinished thought, a leading statement, a slight [[Pausa|pause]], an echoing voice, or a nervous or awkward silence.  [[Aposiopesis]] is the use of an ellipsis to trail off into silence—for example: "But I thought he was …" When placed at the beginning or end of a sentence, the ellipsis can also inspire a feeling of melancholy or longing.

The most common form of an ellipsis is a row of three periods or full points&lt;!--Not full stop; the full stop is the role played by the full point in terminating a sentence.--&gt; (...) or a precomposed triple-dot glyph (…).  The usage of the [[em dash]] (—) can overlap the usage of the ellipsis, especially in dialogue. Style guides often have their own rules governing the use of ellipses. For example, ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'' (''Chicago'' style) recommends that an ellipsis be formed by typing three periods, each with a space on both sides (&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;), while the ''[[Associated Press Stylebook]]'' (''AP'' style) puts the dots together, but retains a space before and after the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Em Dashes and Ellipses: Closed or Spaced Out? |first=Karen |last=Yin |work=AP vs Chicago: Edit or Die |publisher=Quiet Press |date=2011 |url= https://apvschicago.com/2011/05/em-dashes-and-ellipses-closed-or-spaced.html |access-date=27 July 2018}} {{better source needed|date=July 2018|reason=Just some blog; better to get this from official AP materials, but this will do for now.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether an ellipsis at the end of a sentence needs a fourth dot to finish the sentence is a matter of debate; ''Chicago'' advises it,&lt;ref&gt;''The Chicago Manual of Style'', 17th edition (2017), §&amp;thinsp;13.51–52.&lt;/ref&gt; as does the ''[[Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association]]'' (APA style),&lt;ref&gt;Summarized here: {{cite web |first=Paige |last=Jackson |title=Ellipses–When and How? |date=22 April 2011 |work=Blog.APAStyle.org |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |url= http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/04/ellipses-when-and-how.html |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171210122450/http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/04/ellipses-when-and-how.html |archive-date=10 December 2017 |access-date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while some other style guides do not;{{citation needed|date=July 2018|reason=Should be easy to source, but we need to actually do it.}} the ''[[Merriam-Webster]] Dictionary'' and related works treat this style as optional, saying that it "may" be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Usage Notes: All About Ellipses – It's time to stop calling them 'dot dot dot' |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2017 |work=Merriam-Webster.com |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |url= https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/ellipses-definition-uses |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170531171513/https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/ellipses-definition-uses |archive-date=31 May 2017 |access-date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; More commonly, a normal full stop (period) terminates the sentence, then a {{em|separate}} three-dot ellipsis is used to indicate one or more subsequent elided sentences before continuing a longer quotation. ''[[Business Insider]]'' magazine suggests this style,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Here's how to use the four-dot ellipsis like a pro |first=Melia |last=Robinson |date=30 April 2016 |work=BusinessInsider.com |publisher=[[Insider Inc.]] / [[Axel Springer SE]] |url= https://www.businessinsider.com/when-to-use-the-four-dot-ellipsis-2016-4 |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171224064651/https://www.businessinsider.com/when-to-use-the-four-dot-ellipsis-2016-4 |archive-date=24 December 2017 |access-date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is also used in many [[academic journal]]s. Even the ''[[Associated Press Stylebook]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Using AP Style Ellipses Correctly |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=5 December 2017 |work=WordAgents.com |location=Lindenhurst, New York |publisher=Word Agents |url= http://wordagents.com/ap-style-ellipses/ |access-date=27 July 2018}} {{better source needed|date=July 2018|reason=Just some blog; better to get this from official AP materials, but this will do for now.}}&lt;/ref&gt; – notably hostile to punctuation that journalists may consider optional and removable to save newsprint column width – favors this approach.  It is consistent in intent if not exact form with the agreement among those in favor of a fused four-dot ellipsis that the first of them is a full stop terminating the sentence and the other three are the ellipsis.

==In writing==
In her book on the ellipsis, ''Ellipsis in English Literature: Signs of Omission'' (Cambridge University Press, 2015), Anne Toner suggests that the first use of the punctuation in the English language dates to a 1588 translation of [[Terence]]'s ''[[Andria (comedy)|Andria]]'', by [[Maurice Kyffin]].&lt;ref name="Toner" /&gt; In this case, however, the ellipsis consists not of dots but of short dashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/dot-dot-dot-how-the-ellipsis-made-its-mark |first=Alex |last=Buxton |title=… dot, dot, dot: How the ellipsis made its mark |work= Research |date=21 October 2015 |location=Cambridge, England |publisher=[[Cambridge University]] |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180104063312/https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/dot-dot-dot-how-the-ellipsis-made-its-mark |archive-date=4 January 2018 |access-date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Subpuncting" of [[medieval]] manuscripts also denotes omitted meaning and may be related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McNabb |first=Cameron Hunt |title=The Mysterious History of the Ellipsis, From Medieval Subpuncting to Irrational Numbers |url= http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2016/08/17/the_ellipsis_in_medieval_manuscripts_how_subpuncting_in_the_middle_ages.html |access-date=18 August 2016 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, an ellipsis was often used when a writer intentionally omitted a specific proper noun, such as a location: "Jan was born on .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;Street in Warsaw."{{CN|date=January 2018}}

As commonly used, this juxtaposition of characters is referred to as "dots of ellipsis" in the English language.&lt;ref name="HumezHumez2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Humez|first1=Alexander|last2=Humez|first2=Nicholas|title=On the Dot: The Speck that Changed the World|date=2 October 2008|isbn=9780190295943|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&amp;linkCode=qs&amp;keywords=9780190295943|accessdate=11 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811003951/https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&amp;linkCode=qs&amp;keywords=9780190295943|archivedate=11 August 2016|chapter=Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, it would be used in pulp fiction and other works of early 20th-century fiction to denote expletives that would otherwise have been censored.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Chandler, Frank MacShane. ''Raymond Chandler: Stories and Early Novels''. First Edition. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Library of America]]. 1995. ''Note on the Texts''.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ellipsis may also imply an unstated alternative indicated by context. For example, when Sue says "I never drink wine&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;", the implication is that she does drink something else{{mdash}}such as vodka.

In reported speech, the ellipsis can be used to represent an intentional silence.

In poetry, an ellipsis is used as a thought-pause or [[Line break (poetry)|line break]] at the [[caesura]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classroom.synonym.com/ellipses-poem-3994.html|title=What Are Ellipses in a Poem?|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or this is used to highlight sarcasm or make the reader think about the last points in the poem.

In news reporting, often associated with [[brackets]], it is used to indicate that a quotation has been condensed for space, brevity or relevance.

[[Herb Caen]], Pulitzer-prize-winning columnist for the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', became famous for his "three-dot journalism".&lt;ref name=Caen&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/492296/HERB-CAEN-WAY----HONORS-SF-COLUMNIST.html `HERB CAEN WAY . . .' HONORS S.F. COLUMNIST], in the ''[[Deseret News]]''; published May 29, 1996; retrieved September 5, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==In different languages==
{{anchor|In English|reason=Ellipsis in English redirects here.}}
===In American English===
''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'' suggests the use of an ellipsis for any omitted word, phrase, line, or paragraph from within but not at the end of a quoted passage. There are two commonly used methods of using ellipses: one uses three dots for any omission, while the second one makes a distinction between omissions within a sentence (using three dots:&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.) and omissions between sentences (using a period and a space followed by three dots:&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;...).

The [[Modern Language Association]] (MLA) used to indicate that an ellipsis must include spaces before and after each dot in all uses. If an ellipsis is meant to represent an omission, [[square bracket]]s must surround the ellipsis to make it clear that there was no pause in the original quote: [&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;]. Currently, the MLA has removed the requirement of brackets in its style handbooks. However, some maintain that the use of brackets is still correct because it clears confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, H. Ramsey, Jane E. Aaron, Murray McArthur. ''The Little, Brown Handbook''. Fourth Canadian Edition. [[Toronto]]: [[Longman|Pearson Longman]]. 2005. p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MLA now indicates that a three-dot, spaced ellipsis (&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;) should be used for removing material from within one sentence within a quote. When crossing sentences (when the omitted text contains a period, so that omitting the end of a sentence counts), a four-dot, spaced (except for before the first dot) ellipsis (.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;) should be used. When ellipsis points are used in the original text, ellipsis points that are not in the original text should be distinguished by enclosing them in square brackets (e.g. "text […] text").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uhv.edu/student-success-center/resources/e-p/ellipsis-use-in-mla-style/|last=Jones|first=Karalyn|title=Using Ellipsis in MLA Style|institution=[[University of Houston–Victoria]]|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://naropa.edu/documents/programs/jks/naropa-writing-center/citation-comparison.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Associated Press, the ellipsis should be used to condense quotations. It is less commonly used to indicate a pause in speech or an unfinished thought or to separate items in material such as show business gossip. The stylebook indicates that if the shortened sentence before the mark can stand as a sentence, it should do so, with an ellipsis placed after the period or other ending punctuation. When material is omitted at the end of a paragraph and also immediately following it, an ellipsis goes both at the end of that paragraph and at the beginning of the next, according to this style.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Norm, editor. "Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law". 2005. pp.328–329.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Robert Bringhurst's ''[[Elements of Typographic Style]]'', the details of typesetting ellipses depend on the character and size of the font being set and the typographer's preference. Bringhurst writes that a full space between each dot is "another Victorian eccentricity. In most contexts, the Chicago ellipsis is much too wide"—he recommends using flush dots, or [[thin space|''thin''-spaced]] dots (up to one-fifth of an [[em (typography)|em]]), or the prefabricated ellipsis character ({{unichar|1=2026|2=HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS|html=}}. Bringhurst suggests that normally an ellipsis should be spaced fore-and-aft to separate it from the text, but when it combines with other punctuation, the leading space disappears and the other punctuation follows. This is the usual practice in typesetting. He provides the following examples:

{| summary="six examples of setting ellipsis" style="margin-left:3em;"
|-
| style="width:5em;" | i&amp;nbsp;… j
| style="width:5em;" | k….
| style="width:5em;" | l…, l
| style="width:5em;" | l,&amp;nbsp;… l
| style="width:5em;" | m…?
| style="width:5em;" | n…!
|}

In legal writing in the United States, Rule 5.3 in the ''[[Bluebook]]'' citation guide governs the use of ellipses and requires a space before the first dot and between the two subsequent dots. If an ellipsis ends the sentence, then there are three dots, each separated by a space, followed by the final punctuation (e.g. Hah . . . ?). In some legal writing, an ellipsis is written as three [[asterisk]]s (*** or *&amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;*) to make it obvious that text has been omitted.
(...) is also used for awkward silence.

===In British English===

''The [[Hart's Rules|Oxford Style Guide]]'' recommends setting the ellipsis as a single character (…) or as a series of three (narrow) spaced dots (.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.), and surrounding it by spaces. If there is an ellipsis at the end of an incomplete sentence, the final full stop is omitted. However, it is retained if the following ellipsis represents an omission between two complete sentences.&lt;ref&gt;''New Hart's Rules: The Oxford Style Guide''. 2nd ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''The … fox jumps …''
: ''The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. … And if they have not died, they are still alive today.''

Contrary to ''The Oxford Style Guide'', the ''University of Oxford Style Guide'' demands an ellipsis not to be surrounded by spaces, except when it stands for a pause; then, a space has to be set after the ellipsis (but not before). An ellipsis is never preceded or followed by a full stop.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxford/University%20of%20Oxford%20Style%20Guide%20%28updated%20Hilary%20term%202016%29.pdf University of Oxford Style Guide: Hilary term 2016]'' (PDF). Oxford: University of Oxford, 2016. p. 15. Retrieved 18 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''The…fox jumps…''
: ''The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog…And if they have not died, they are still alive today.''
: ''It is not cold… it is freezing cold.''

===In Polish===
When applied in [[Polish language]] syntax, the ellipsis is called {{lang|pl|wielokropek}}, which means "multidot". The word ''wielokropek'' distinguishes the ellipsis of Polish syntax from that of [[mathematical notation]], in which it is known as an {{lang|pl|elipsa}}.

When an ellipsis replaces a fragment omitted from a quotation, the ellipsis is enclosed in parentheses or square brackets. An unbracketed ellipsis indicates an interruption or pause in speech.

The syntactical rules for ellipses are standardized by the 1983 Polska Norma document [[PN-83/P-55366]], {{lang|pl|Zasady składania tekstów w języku polskim}} ("Rules for setting texts in the Polish Language").

===In Russian===
The combination "ellipsis+period" is replaced by the ellipsis. The combinations "ellipsis+exclamation mark" and "ellipsis+question mark" are written in this way: !.. ?..

===In Japanese===
The most common character corresponding to an ellipsis is called ''3''-ten rīdā ("''3''-dot leaders", {{lang|ja|…}}). 2-ten rīdā exists as a character, but it is used less commonly. In writing, the ellipsis consists usually of six dots (two ''3''-ten rīdā characters, {{lang|ja|……}}). Three dots (one ''3''-ten rīdā character) may be used where space is limited, such as in a header. However, variations in the number of dots exist. In horizontally written text the dots are commonly vertically centered within the text height (between the [[Baseline (typography)|baseline]] and the ascent line), as in the standard Japanese [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] fonts; in vertically written text the dots are always centered horizontally. As the Japanese word for dot is pronounced "{{lang|ja-Latn|ten}}", the dots are colloquially called "{{lang|ja-Latn|ten-ten-ten}}" ({{lang|ja|てんてんてん}}, akin to the English "dot dot dot")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanspo.com/geino/news/20170605/geo17060514190023-n1.html |title=秋元順子、古希に得意のダジャレ　「あまり“コキ”使わないでください」 |date=2017-06-05 |website=SANSPO.COM |publisher=SANKEI DIGITAL Inc. |access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[manga]], the ellipsis by itself represents speechlessness, or a "[[pregnant pause]]". Depending on the context, this could be anything from an admission of guilt to an expression of being dumbfounded at another person's words or actions. As a device, the ''ten-ten-ten'' is intended to focus the reader on a character while allowing the character to not speak any dialogue. This conveys to the reader a focus of the narrative "camera" on the silent subject, implying an expectation of some motion or action. It is not unheard of to see inanimate objects "speaking" the ellipsis.

===In Chinese===
In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the ellipsis is six dots (in two groups of three dots, occupying the same horizontal or vertical space as two characters) (i.e. &lt;span lang="zh"&gt;……&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[[:zh-tw:省略号|省略号]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Spanish===
In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ellipsis is commonly used as a substitute of ''[[et cetera]]'' at the end of unfinished lists. So it means "and so forth" or "and other things".

Other use is the suspension of a part of a text, or a paragraph, or a phrase or a part of a word because it is obvious, or unnecessary, or implied. For instance, sometimes the ellipsis is used to avoid the complete use of expletives.

When the ellipsis is placed alone into a [[Bracket|parenthesis]] (...) or—less often—between [[bracket]]s […], which is what happens usually within a text [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]], it means the original text had more contents on the same position but are not useful to our target in the transcription. When the suppressed text is at the beginning or at the end of a text, the ellipsis does not need to be placed in a parenthesis.

===In French===
In [[French language|French]], the ellipsis is commonly used at the end of lists to represent ''et cetera''. In French typography, the ellipsis is written close up to the preceding word but has a space after it, for example: ''comme ça… pas comme ceci''. If, exceptionally, it begins a sentence, there is a space before and after, for example: ''Lui ? … vaut rien, je crois… ''.

However, any omitted word, phrase or line at the end of a quoted passage would be  indicated like this: [...] (space before and after the square brackets but not inside), for example: '' … à Paris, Nice, Nantes, Toulouse […] ''.

===In German===
In [[German language|German]], the ellipsis in general is surrounded by spaces, if it stands for one or more omitted words. On the other side there is no space between a letter or (part of) a word and an ellipsis, if it stands for one or more omitted letters, that should stick to the written letter or letters.

Example for both cases, using German style: ''The first el…is stands for omitted letters, the second … for an omitted word.''

If the ellipsis is at the end of a sentence, the final full stop is omitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rechtschreibrat.com/DOX/rfdr_regeln_inkl_Nachtraegen.pdf |title=Deutsche Rechtschreibung. Regeln und Wörterverzeichnis |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2010 |website= |publisher= Rat für deutsche Rechtschreibung |access-date=2015-10-18 |quote=$ 100: Stehen die Auslassungspunkte am Ende eines Ganzsatzes, so setzt man keinen Satzschlusspunkt. |page=100 |language=German |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Example: ''I think that …''

[[Image:Menu (computing) example.PNG|thumb|A [[drop-down menu]] of [[file operation]]s]]
== Usage in menus ==
In computer [[Menu (computing)|menu functions]] or [[button]]s, an appended ellipsis means that on selection another dialog will follow, where the user can or must make a choice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://developer.apple.com/macos/human-interface-guidelines/menus/menu-anatomy/ developer.apple.com: Menu and Menu Item Titles]&lt;/ref&gt; If the ellipsis is missing, the function is already executed on selection.
* "Save" – the file will be overwritten without further input.
* "Save as…" – in the following dialog, you can, for example, select another location, file name, or format.

==In mathematical notation==
An ellipsis is also often used in [[mathematics]] to mean "and so forth". In a list, between commas, or following a comma, a normal ellipsis is used, as in:

: &lt;math&gt;1,2,3,\ldots,100&lt;/math&gt;

or to mean an infinite list, as:

: &lt;math&gt;1,2,3,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

To indicate the omission of values in a repeated operation, an ellipsis raised to the center of the line is used between two operation symbols or following the last operation symbol, as in:

: &lt;math&gt;1+2+3+\cdots+100&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes, e.g. in Russian mathematical texts, normal, non-raised, ellipses are used even in repeated summations&lt;ref&gt;Мильчин А. Э. [http://slovari.yandex.ru/~книги/Издательский%20словарь/Многоточие%20в%20математических%20формулах/ Издательский словарь-справочник].— Изд. 3-е, испр. и доп., Электронное — М.: ОЛМА-Пресс, 2006. (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;.

The latter formula means the sum of all [[natural number]]s from 1 to 100. However, it is not a formally defined [[mathematical symbol]]. Repeated summations or products may similarly be denoted using [[Capital sigma notation|capital sigma]] and [[capital pi notation]], respectively:

: &lt;math&gt;1+2+3+\cdots+100\ = \sum_{n=1}^{100} n&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;1 \times 2 \times 3 \times \cdots \times 100\ = \prod_{n=1}^{100} n = 100!&lt;/math&gt; (see [[factorial]])

Normally dots should be used only where the pattern to be followed is clear, the exception being to show the indefinite continuation of an [[irrational number]] such as:

: &lt;math&gt;\pi=3.14159265\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes, it is useful to display a formula compactly, for example:

: &lt;math&gt;1+4+9+\cdots+n^2+\cdots+400&lt;/math&gt;

Another example is the set of [[Root of a function|zeros]] of the [[cosine]] [[Function (mathematics)|function]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\left\{\pm\frac{\pi}{2}, \pm\frac{3\pi}{2}, \pm\frac{5\pi}{2}, \ldots \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

There are many related uses of the ellipsis in [[set notation]].

The diagonal and vertical forms of the ellipsis are particularly useful for showing missing terms in [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], such as the size-''n'' [[identity matrix]]:

: &lt;math&gt;I_n = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The use of ellipses in mathematical proofs is often discouraged because of the potential for ambiguity.  For this reason, and because the ellipsis supports no systematic rules for symbolic calculation, in recent years some authors have recommended avoiding its use in mathematics altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Backhouse, ''Program Construction: Calculating Implementations from Specifications''.  Wiley (2003), page 138&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programming languages ==
A two- or three-dot ellipsis is used as an [[operator (programming)|operator]] in some [[programming language]]s. The precise meaning varies by language, but it generally involves something dealing with multiple items. One of its most common uses is in defining ranges or sequences. This is used in many languages, including Pascal, Modula, Oberon, Ada, Haskell, Perl, Python, Ruby, Bash shell and F#. It is also used to indicate so called [[variadic function]]s in the C, C++ and Java languages. ''See [[Ellipsis (programming operator)]]''.

===HTML and CSS===
The CSS &lt;code&gt;text-overflow&lt;/code&gt; property can be set to &lt;code&gt;ellipsis&lt;/code&gt;, which cuts off text with an ellipsis when it overflows the content area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-overflow|title=text-overflow|website=Mozilla Developer Network|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drafts.csswg.org/css-ui-3/#text-overflow|title=CSS Basic User Interface Module Level 3 (CSS3 UI)|website=drafts.csswg.org|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On the Internet and in text messaging==
The ellipsis is a non-verbal cue that is often used in computer-mediated interactions, in particular in synchronous genres, such as chat. The reason behind its popularity is the fact that it allows people to indicate in writing several  functions:
* The sign of ellipsis can function as a floor holding device, and signal that more is to come, for instance when people break up longer turns in chat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simpson|first=J|title=Meaning-making online: Discourse and CMC in a Language learning community|journal=Recent Research Developments in Learning Technologies|year=2005|citeseerx = 10.1.1.108.463}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dot-dot-dot can be used systematically to enact linguistic politeness, for instance indicating topic change or hesitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Erika|first=Darics|title=Relational work in synchronous text-based CMC of virtual teams|journal=Handbook of research on discourse behavior and digital communication: language structures and social interaction|year=2010|url=http://eprints.port.ac.uk/3682/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Suspension dots can be [[turn construction unit]]s to signal silence, for example when indicating disagreement, disapproval or confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ong|first=Kenneth Keng Wee|title=Disagreement, Confusion, Disapproval, Turn Elicitation and Floor Holding: Actions accomplished by Ellipsis Marks-Only Turns and Blank Turns in Quasisynchronous Chat|journal=Discourse Studies|year=2011|volume=13|issue=2|doi=10.1177/1461445610392138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although an ellipsis is technically complete with three periods (...), its rise in popularity as a "trailing-off" or "silence" indicator, particularly in mid-20th-century comic strip and comic book prose writing, has led to expanded uses online. Today, extended ellipsis anywhere from two to dozens of periods have become common constructions in Internet chat rooms and text messages.&lt;ref name=dots&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/facultyprofiles/files/publications/ADmanessj/Maness--The%20Power%20of%20Dots%28personal%29.pdf|title=The Power of Dots: Using Nonverbal Compensators in Chat Reference|first=Jack M.|last=Maness|year=2007|conference=Annual Meeting of ASIS&amp;T|conferenceurl=http://www.asis.org/Conferences/AM07/|booktitle=Proceedings of the 2007 Annual Meeting of ASIS&amp;T|publisher=University Libraries − [[University of Colorado at Boulder]]|format=PDF|accessdate=24 October 2011|doi=10.1002/meet.1450440341}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The extent of repetition in itself might serve as an additional contextualization or paralinguistic cue, to "extend the lexical meaning of the words, add character to the sentences, and allow fine-tuning and personalisation of the message".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kalman |first=Yoram M |last2=Gergle|first2=Darren|title=CMC cues enrich lean online communication: the case of letter and punctuation mark repetitions |url=http://www.kalmans.com/MCIS2010Cues.pdf |accessdate=9 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer representations==
In [[computing]], several ellipsis [[character (computing)|characters]] have been codified, depending on the system used.

In the [[Unicode]] standard, there are the following characters:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name !! Character !! Unicode !! UTF-8 !! [[HTML entity]] name or&lt;br/&gt;[[Numeric character reference]] !! Use

|}

In Windows, it can be inserted with {{key press|Alt|0}}{{key press|1}}{{key press|3}}{{key press|3}}.

In OS X, it can be inserted with {{key press|Opt|;}} (on an English language keyboard).

In some Linux distributions, it can be inserted with {{key press|AltGr|.}}, or alternatively {{key press|[[Compose key|Compose]]}} {{key press|.}} {{key press|.}} sequence can be used.

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and sometimes in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], ellipsis characters are made by entering two consecutive ''horizontal ellipsis'' (U+2026).{{clarify|date=February 2011}} In vertical texts, the application should rotate the symbol accordingly.

Unicode recognizes a series of three [[full stop|period]] characters (U+002E) as [[Unicode equivalence|compatibility equivalent (though not canonical)]] to the horizontal ellipsis character.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt UnicodeData.txt]: &lt;code&gt;2026;HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS;Po;0;ON;&amp;lt;compat&amp;gt; 002E 002E 002E;;;;N;;;;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[HTML]], the horizontal ellipsis character may be represented by the entity reference &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;hellip;&lt;/code&gt; (since HTML 4.0), and the vertical ellipsis character by the entity reference &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;vellip;&lt;/code&gt; (since HTML 5.0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110113/named-character-references.html#entity-vellip |title=W3C Working Draft: HTML5: 8.5 Named character references |year=2011 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, in HTML, [[XML]], and [[SGML]], a [[numeric character reference]] such as &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#x2026;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#8230;&lt;/code&gt; can be used.

In the [[TeX]] typesetting system, the following types of ellipsis are available:
{| class="wikitable"
! Name !! Glyph !! TeX markup
|-
| Lower ellipsis
|  style="text-align:center; vertical-align:bottom;"| &lt;math&gt;\ldots&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;\ldots&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| Centred ellipsis
| style="text-align:center;"| &lt;math&gt;\cdots&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;\cdots&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| Diagonal ellipsis
| style="text-align:center;"| &lt;math&gt;\ddots&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;\ddots&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| Vertical ellipsis
| style="text-align:center;"| &lt;math&gt;\vdots&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;\vdots&lt;/code&gt;
|}

In [[LaTeX]], note that the reverse orientation of &lt;code&gt;\ddots&lt;/code&gt; can be achieved with &lt;code&gt;\reflectbox&lt;/code&gt; provided by the &lt;code&gt;graphicx&lt;/code&gt; package: &lt;code&gt;\reflectbox{\ddots}&lt;/code&gt; yields [[File:Iddots black.svg|18px]].

With the &lt;code&gt;amsmath&lt;/code&gt; package from [[AMS-Latex|AMS-LaTeX]], more specific ellipses are provided for math mode.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/amsldoc.pdf#page=16 ''User's Guide for the &lt;code&gt;amsmath&lt;/code&gt; Package'']. American Mathematical Society, 1999, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Markup !! Usage || Example || Output
|-
| &lt;code&gt;\dotsc&lt;/code&gt; || dots with commas || &lt;code&gt;1, 2, \dotsc , 9&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;1, 2, \dotsc , 9&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;\dotsb&lt;/code&gt; || dots with binary operators/relations || &lt;code&gt;1 + 2 + \dotsb + 9&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;1 + 2 + \dotsb + 9&lt;/math&gt;

|}

The horizontal ellipsis character also appears in the following older character maps:
* in [[Windows code page|Windows-1250—Windows-1258]] and in IBM/MS-DOS [[Code page 874]], at [[code point|code]] 85 (hexadecimal)
* in [[Mac-Roman encoding|Mac-Roman]], [[Macintosh Central European encoding|Mac-CentEuro]] and several other Macintosh encodings&lt;!-- surely, in MacCyrillic, but I am not willing to check how many Mac CPs have … at this code point --Incnis Mrsi --&gt;, at code C9 (hexadecimal)
* in [[Ventura International encoding]] at code C1 (hexadecimal)

Note that [[ISO/IEC 8859]] encoding series provides no code point for ellipsis.

As with all characters, especially those outside the [[ASCII]] range, the author, sender and receiver of an encoded ellipsis must be in agreement upon what bytes are being used to represent the character. Naive text processing software may improperly assume that a particular encoding is being used, resulting in [[mojibake]].

The [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Style]] Q&amp;A recommends to avoid the use of '''…'''&amp;nbsp;(U+2026) character in manuscripts and to place three periods plus two nonbreaking spaces (.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.) instead, so that an editor, publisher, or designer can replace them later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/CMS_FAQ/SpecialCharacters/SpecialCharacters09.html |title=Chicago Style Q&amp;A: How do I insert an ellipsis in my manuscript? |year=2010 |work=[[The Chicago Manual of Style]], edition 16 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Abstract Syntax Notation One]] (ASN.1), the ellipsis is used as an extension marker to indicate the possibility of type extensions in future revisions of a protocol specification. In a type constraint expression like &lt;code&gt;A ::= INTEGER (0..127, ..., 256..511)&lt;/code&gt; an ellipsis is used to separate the extension root from extension additions. The definition of type A in version 1 system of the form &lt;code&gt;A ::= INTEGER (0..127, ...)&lt;/code&gt; and the definition of type A in version 2 system of the form &lt;code&gt;A ::= INTEGER (0..127, ..., 256..511)&lt;/code&gt; constitute an extension series of the same type A in different versions of the same specification. The ellipsis can also be used in compound type definitions to separate the set of fields belonging to the extension root from the set of fields constituting extension additions. Here is an example: &lt;code&gt;B ::= SEQUENCE { a INTEGER, b INTEGER, ..., c INTEGER }&lt;/code&gt; &lt;!-- Is the s.n. ellipsis defined as a "..." trigraph or something else?  This paragraph is a matter of syntax, not text *representation*, and therefore is misplaced. --Incnis Mrsi --&gt;

'''Esad Erbili''' or '''Mehmed Esad Efendi''' (1847–1931) was a [[shaykh]] of the [[Naqshbandi|Naqshi]]-[[Khalidi]] [[sufi order]] and brought a branch of the Naqshbandiyyah with him to Istanbul at the beginning of [[World War I]].

==Biography==

Esad Erbili was born in [[Arbil]] in Iraq in the year 1847 (1264), where he studied under Taha al-Hariri. After the death of Shaykh al-Hariri in 1875 he visited Istanbul for a short time. He was exiled to Arbil in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Türkiye Ekonomik ve Toplumsal Tarih Vakfı, ''Dünden Bugüne İstanbul Ansiklopedisi'', Kültür Bakanlığı, 1994, {{ISBN|978-975-7306-06-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dW9pAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Esad+Erbil%C3%AE,+faaliyetlerini+daha+farkl%C4%B1+bir+konumda+s%C3%BCrd%C3%BCrm%C3%BC%C5%9F%22&amp;dq=%22Esad+Erbil%C3%AE,+faaliyetlerini+daha+farkl%C4%B1+bir+konumda+s%C3%BCrd%C3%BCrm%C3%BC%C5%9F%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fzlXTvfiLbH3mAWVn4SODA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA p. 37.] {{Tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later returning in 1910 to established a Dergah (Tekke) in [[Üsküdar]]&lt;ref name="Altin"&gt;Yilmaz, H. Kamil:"Altin Silsile" ("Golden Chain"). Erkam Yayinlari (Istanbul). 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
Master M. Es’ad was rather tall, White bearded, had straining eyes, dark-skinned, smiling, endearmently and staid person. He had a very strong mind that he could know the person whom he talked years before, and he used to remember the topic they talked.

The 30th chain of the Golden Silsilah was again from Iraq, Arbil/Musul, was born in 1264/1847. He is “Sayyid” both from mother and father. His father is the Shaikh of Khalidî Tekke (lodge) in Arbil, named Master M. Saîd. His grandfather Master Hidayetullah is the khalifa where Mevlana Halid el-Baghdadi built the tekke in Arbil.
After completing his first education in Arbil and Deyr, while he was 23 (in 1287/1847), with a spiritual point, he became affiliated with Naqshi-Khalidi Shaikh Taha’l-Hariri. He completed his spiritual evolve in 5 years and got caliphate. Then he went to Hijaz in 1292/1875.

'''Arriving Istanbul'''

Returning from Hajj, and having lost his Shaikh, he came to Istanbul. He stayed at “Besiraga Dargah” as a guest  in Salkimsogut. After lovers and visitors of him increased a lot, he left there and settled the muezzin room of a mosque in Bayezid-Parmakkapi. He taught the “Khafiz Divan” and “Luccet-ul Asrar” of Mawlana Jamii in Fatih Mosque. Many people of knowledge and wisdom continued these lessons. Hodja Master Yekta and some other scholars recognized him in these lessons and became affiliated with him.

In a short time, his reputation encircled Istanbul and the son-in-law of the Sultan, Darwish Pashazade Khalid Pasha invited him to the Palace and learned Arabic and religious sciences from him. M. Es’ad Erbili was appointed to the member of Majles-I Mashayih by Sultan Abdul Hamid II. He used to go to Majles during the meetings, to the Fatih Mosque for lessons and sometimes used to go to the Palace.

In the meantime, he moved his house to one of the rooms which are over the gates of Bayezid Mosuqe. Moreover, he appealed for a “tekke”. At that time, “Kadirî Dargah” was free. Because this place is of a Kadirî Dargah, the Sheikh should have a Kadirî diploma (permit). Master M. Esad was appointed to this dargah after having diploma from one of the grandchilds of Abd el-Kader Gîlānî, named Abdulhameed er-Refqanî. There he first made Kadirî ritual and afterwards he made “Hatm-I Hacegan”

===Assembly of Shaykhs===

In 1914, Esad Erbili was appointed the chairman of the Assembly of Shaykhs&lt;ref&gt;Brian Silverstain, "Sufism and Modernity in Turkey: From the Authenticity of Experience to the Practice of Discipline," in M. van Bruinessen and J.

===Menemen Incident===

As part of the [[Atatürk's Reforms]], the tekke in Istanbul was closed. He was captured with his son Mehmed Efendi because they were thought to be involved in the [[Menemen Incident|1930 Menemen Incident]]. Esad Efendi was initially sentenced to death, later his penalty was reduced to life in jail because of his age&lt;ref&gt;[[Mustafa Armağan]], [http://www.mustafaarmagan.com.tr/menemen-olayinda-10-buyuk-suphe.html "Menemen olayında 10 büyük şüphe"], official personal webcite of Mustafa Armağan. {{Tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Touraj Atabaki, ''The State and the Subaltern: Modernization, Society and the State in Turkey and Iran'', I.B.Tauris, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-84511-339-1}},　[https://books.google.com/books?id=6rgGbKh3spgC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=%22Sentenced+initially+to+death,+Es%27ad+Efendi+%27s+penalty,+because+of+his+age,+was+commuted+to+a+life+sentence.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mjFXTu2QN_D1mAXs2eSnDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sentenced%20initially%20to%20death%2C%20Es%27ad%20Efendi%20%27s%20penalty%2C%20because%20of%20his%20age%2C%20was%20commuted%20to%20a%20life%20sentence.%22&amp;f=false p. 131.]&lt;/ref&gt; and he was poisoned and died shortly afterwards in a Military Hospital in Izmir.&lt;ref name="Altin"/&gt; The following couplet of him is considered as an oracle that he perceived that he will be martyrized:

"How possible it is to ablution the martyr with that much fire who was martyrized by burning with love? The body is fired, the shroud is fired, and also the water that is pouring out is fired".

{{Evidence law}}
In [[law]], a '''foundation''' is sufficient preliminary [[evidence (law)|evidence]] of the [[Authentication (law)|authenticity]] and [[relevance (law)|relevance]] for the [[admissible evidence|admission]] of material evidence in the form of exhibits or [[testimony]] of [[witness]]es.  [[Materiality (law)|Material]] evidence is important evidence that may serve to determine the outcome of a case.  Exhibits include [[real evidence]], illustrative evidence, [[demonstrative evidence]], and [[documentary evidence]].  The type of preliminary evidence necessary to lay the proper foundation depends on the form and type of material evidence offered.

The lack of foundation is a valid [[objection (law)|objection]] that an [[adverse party]] may raise during [[trial (law)|trial]].

{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2013}}
The '''Fourth Reich''' ({{lang-de|Viertes Reich}}) is a hypothetical future [[German Reich]] that is the successor to the [[Third Reich]] (1933–1945).

The term "Third Reich" was coined by [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck]] in his 1923 book ''[[Das Dritte Reich]]''. He defined the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (962–1806) as the "First Reich", and the [[German Empire]] (1871–1918) as the "Second Reich", while the "Third Reich" was an ideal state including all German peoples, including [[Austria]]. In the modern context the term refers to [[Nazi Germany]]. It was used by the Nazis to legitimize their regime as a successor state to the retroactively-renamed First and Second Reichs.

The term "Fourth Reich" has been used in a variety of different ways. [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazis]] have used it to describe their envisioned revival of an ethnically pure state, mostly in reference to, but not limited to, Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/all-american-nazis-628023/|title=All-American Nazis: Inside the Rise of Fascist Youth in the U.S.|last=Reitman|first=Janet|date=2018-05-02|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have used the term derogatorily, such as [[conspiracy theorists]] like Max Spiers, Dr. Joseph P. Farrell, [[Peter Levenda]], and [[Jim Marrs]] who have used it to refer to what they perceive as a covert continuation of Nazi ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/conspiracy-theorist-max-spiers-discussed-rise-of-fourth-reich-in-final-interview-before-mysterious-a3370686.html|title=Conspiracy theorist discussed 'Fourth Reich' in final interview|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Nazism==
[[File:Karte des Deutschen Reiches, Weimarer Republik-Drittes Reich 1919–1937.svg|thumb|250px|right|Map of Germany in 1933]]
In terms of [[neo-Nazism]], the Fourth Reich is envisioned as featuring [[Aryan race#Neo-Nazism|Aryan supremacy]], [[anti-Semitism]], ''[[Lebensraum]]'', aggressive [[militarism]] and [[totalitarianism]]. Upon the establishment of the Fourth Reich, German neo-Nazis propose that Germany should acquire [[nuclear weapons]] and use the threat of their use as a form of [[nuclear blackmail]] to re-expand to Germany's former boundaries as of 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Michael ''The New Reich—Violent Extremism in Germany and Beyond'', 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on pamphlets published by [[David Myatt]] in the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;These writings of Myatt included the 14 pamphlets in his ''Thormynd Press National-Socialist Series'', most of which were republished by Liberty Bell Publications (Reedy, Virginia) in the 1990s, and essays such as ''Towards Destiny: Creating a New National-Socialist Reich'' [archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20040712101315/http://www.geocities.com/myattns/newreich.html] and a constitution for the 'fourth Reich' [archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20041208070520/http://www.geocities.com/myattns/cons_reich.html]&lt;/ref&gt; many neo-Nazis came to believe that the rise of the Fourth Reich in [[Germany]] would pave the way for the establishment of the ''Western Imperium'', a [[Aryan race|pan-Aryan]] [[world empire]] encompassing all land populated by predominantly European-descended peoples (i.e., Europe, [[Russia]], [[Anglo-America]], [[Australia]], South America's [[Southern Cone]], [[New Zealand]], [[White South African|South Africa]]).&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas ''[[Black Sun (Goodrick-Clarke book)|Black Sun]]: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and The Politics of Identity'' New York: 2002--N.Y. University Press, See Chapters 4 and 11 for extensive information about the proposed "Western Imperium"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage to indicate German influence in the European Union==
Some commentators in various parts of Europe have used the term "Fourth Reich" to point at the influence that they believe Germany exerts within the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/15/the-fourth-reich-is-here---without-a-shot-being-fired/|title=The Fourth Reich is here - without a shot being fired|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=15 May 2016 |access-date=2017-02-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2015/04/26/merkels-tyskland-fjarde-riket |title=Merkels Tyskland - Fjärde Riket? |date=4 May 2016 |access-date=15 November 2018 |language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-power-in-the-age-of-the-euro-crisis-a-1024714.html|title='The Fourth Reich': What Some Europeans See When They Look at Germany - SPIEGEL ONLINE - International|newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]]|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frafra''' or Farefare, also known as '''Gurenɛ''', is the language of the [[Frafra people]] of northern Ghana, particularly the [[Upper East Region]], and southern Burkina Faso. It is a national language of Ghana, and is closely related to [[Dagomba language|Dagbani]] and other languages of Northern [[Ghana]], and also related to [[Mossi language|Mossi]], also known as Mooré, the national language of Burkina Faso.

Frafra consists of three principal dialects, Gurenɛ (also written ''Gudenne, Gurenne, Gudeni, Zuadeni''), Nankani (''Naani, Nankanse, Ninkare''), and Booni.  [[Nabit language|Nabit]] and [[Talni language|Talni]] have been mistakenly reported to be Frafra dialects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2015-014.pdf ISO change request]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francisco Balbi di Correggio''' (16 March 1505 – 12 December 1589), born in [[Correggio]] in the province of Province of [[Reggio Emilia]], Italy, was an  [[arquebus]]ier who served with the Spanish contingent during the [[Siege of Malta (1565)|Siege of Malta]]. Little is known about him other than that he maintained a journal throughout the siege, which he afterwards published.

Balbi's is the best-known eyewitness account of the siege (there is at least one other, in the form of a long poem by the knight Hipolito Sans), and all subsequent histories rely heavily upon it, including that of [[Giacomo Bosio]], the official historian of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St. John]], whose massive account first appeared in 1588.

Balbi's journal, apparently with some revisions after the fact, was first published in Spain in 1567. A second revised and extended edition was published in 1568.  The first English translation appeared in 1961 by Henry A. Balbi, who might have been a distant descendent of the author.  Another, less literal translation with some cuts was made by Ernle Bradford in 1965.

{{Table_Numeral_Systems}}
The system of '''Hebrew numerals''' is a quasi-decimal alphabetic [[numeral system]] using the letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]].
The system was adapted from that of the [[Greek numerals]] in the late 2nd century BCE.

The current numeral system is also known as the ''Hebrew alphabetic numerals'' to contrast with earlier systems of writing numerals used in classical antiquity. These systems were inherited from usage in the [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]] and [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] scripts, attested from c. 800 BC in the so-called [[Samaria ostraca]] and sometimes known as ''Hebrew-Aramaic numerals'', ultimately derived from the Egyptian [[Hieratic numerals]].

The Greek system was adopted in [[Hellenistic Judaism]] and had been in use in Greece since about the 5th century BC.
&lt;ref&gt; Stephen Chrisomalis, ''Numerical Notation: A Comparative History'', Cambridge University Press, 2010,
[https://books.google.ch/books?id=ux--OWgWvBQC&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 157]; Solomon Gandz, ''Hebrew Numerals'',  Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research
Vol. 4, (1932 - 1933), pp. 53-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this system, there is no notation for [[0 (number)|zero]], and the numeric values for individual letters are added together.  Each unit (1, 2, ..., 9) is assigned a separate letter, each tens (10, 20, ..., 90) a separate letter, and the first four hundreds (100, 200, 300, 400) a separate letter. The later hundreds (500, 600, 700, 800 and 900) are represented by the sum of two or three letters representing the first four hundreds. To represent numbers from 1,000 to 999,999, the same letters are reused to serve as thousands, tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands. [[Gematria]] (Jewish numerology) uses these transformations extensively.

In [[Israel]] today, the decimal system of [[Arabic numerals]] (ex. 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) is used in almost all cases (money, age, date on the [[civil calendar]]).  The Hebrew numerals are used only in special cases, such as when using the [[Hebrew calendar]], or numbering a list (similar to a, b, c, d, etc.), much as [[Roman numerals]] are used in the West.

==Numbers==
The Hebrew language has names for common numbers that range from zero to one million. Letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] are used to represent numbers in a few traditional contexts, for example in calendars. In other situations Arabic numerals are used. [[Cardinal numbers|Cardinal]] and [[ordinal numbers]] must agree in gender with the noun they are describing. If there is no such noun (e.g. telephone numbers), the feminine form is used. For ordinal numbers greater than ten the cardinal is used and numbers above the value 20 have no gender.

'''Note:''' For numbers greater than 20, gender does not apply. Officially, numbers greater than million were represented by the [[long scale]]; However, since January 21st, 2013, the modified [[short scale]] (under which the long scale milliard is substituted for the strict short scale billion), which was already the colloquial standard, became official.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hebrew-academy.org.il/2013/02/07/האקדמיה-ללשון-העברית-התכנסה-לישיבתה-ה-32/ http://www.hebrew-academy.org.il/2013/02/07/האקדמיה-ללשון-העברית-התכנסה-לישיבתה-ה-32/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speaking and writing===
Cardinal and ordinal numbers must agree in gender (masculine or feminine; mixed groups are treated as masculine) with the noun they are describing. If there is no such noun (e.g. a telephone number or a house number in a street address), the feminine form is used. Ordinal numbers must also agree in number and definite status like other adjectives. The cardinal number precedes the noun (e.g., ''shlosha yeladim''), except for the number one which succeeds it (e.g., ''yeled echad''). The number two is special: ''shnayim'' (m.) and ''shtayim'' (f.) become ''shney'' (m.) and ''shtey'' (f.) when followed by the noun they count. For [[ordinal number]]s (numbers indicating position) greater than ten the cardinal is used.

==Calculations==
The Hebrew numeric system operates on the additive principle in which the numeric values of the letters are added together to form the total.  For example, 177 is represented as קעז which (from right to left) corresponds to 100 + 70 + 7 = 177.

Mathematically, this type of system requires 27 letters (1-9, 10-90, 100-900).  In practice the last letter, ''tav'' (which has the value 400) is used in combination with itself and/or other letters from ''kof'' (100) onwards, to generate numbers from 500 and above.  Alternatively, the 22-letter Hebrew numeral set is sometimes extended to 27 by using 5 ''sofit'' (final) forms of the Hebrew letters.&lt;ref&gt;According to Gandz (p. 96), cited above, this use of the sofit letters was not widely accepted and soon abandoned.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key exceptions===
By convention, the numbers 15 and 16 are represented as ט״ו{{lrm}} (9 + 6) and ט״ז{{lrm}} (9 + 7), respectively, in order to refrain from using the two-letter combinations י-ה{{lrm}} (10 + 5) and י-ו{{lrm}} (10 + 6), which are alternate written forms for the [[Tetragrammaton|Name of God]] in everyday writing. In the calendar, this manifests every [[full moon]], since all Hebrew months start on a [[new moon]] (see for example: [[Tu BiShvat]]).

Combinations which would spell out words with negative connotations are sometimes avoided by switching the order of the letters. For instance, 744 which should be written as תשמ״ד{{lrm}} (meaning "you/it will be destroyed") might instead be written as תשד״מ or תמש״ד (meaning "end to demon").

===Use of final letters===
The Hebrew numeral system has sometimes been extended to include the five final letter forms—ך (500&amp;lrm;), ם (600&amp;lrm;), ן (700&amp;lrm;), ף (800&amp;lrm;) and ץ (900&amp;lrm;)—which are then used to indicate the numbers from 500 to 900.

The ordinary forms for 500 to 900 are: ת״ק (500&amp;lrm;), ת״ר (600&amp;lrm;), ת״ש (700&amp;lrm;), ת״ת (800&amp;lrm;) and תת״ק (900&amp;lrm;).

==Gershayim==
[[File:Baiersdorf Juedischer Friedhof 025 (cropped).JPG|thumb|upright|A tombstone from 1935 in [[Baiersdorf]], [[Germany]], reading:
&lt;poem style="text-align:center"&gt;נפטר ביום '''כׄ''' אייר
ונקבר ביום '''כׄגׄ''' אייר
שנת '''תׄרׄצׄהׄ''' לפׄק&lt;/poem&gt;
In English:
''&lt;poem style="text-align:center"&gt;Passed away on day '''20''' Iyar
And buried on day '''23''' Iyar
Year '''695''' without the thousands [i.e. year 5695]&lt;/poem&gt;''
Note the dots above each letter in each number.]]
[[Gershayim]] (U+05F4 in [[Unicode]], and resembling a [[double quote]] mark) (sometimes erroneously referred to as ''merkha'ot'', which is Hebrew for double quote) are inserted before (to the right of) the last (leftmost) letter to indicate that the sequence of letters represents a number rather than a word.  This is used in the case where a number is represented by two or more Hebrew numerals (''e.g.,'' 28 → כ״ח{{lrm}}).

Similarly, a single [[Geresh]] (U+05F3 in Unicode, and resembling a [[single quote]] mark) is appended after (to the left of) a single letter to indicate that the letter represents a number rather than a (one-letter) word.  This is used in the case where a number is represented by a single Hebrew numeral (''e.g.,'' 100 → ק׳{{lrm}}).

Note that [[Geresh]] and [[Gershayim]] merely indicate "''not a (normal) word.''" Context usually determines whether they indicate a number or something else (such as "''[[Hebrew abbreviations|abbreviation]]''").

An alternative method found in old manuscripts and still found on modern-day tombstones is to put a dot above each letter of the number.

==Decimals==
In print, Arabic numerals are employed in Modern Hebrew for most purposes.  Hebrew numerals are used nowadays primarily for writing the days and years of the [[Hebrew calendar]]; for references to traditional Jewish texts (particularly for Biblical chapter and verse and for Talmudic folios); for bulleted or numbered lists (similar to ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''etc.'', in English); and in numerology ([[gematria]]).

==Thousands and date formats==
Thousands are counted separately, and the thousands count precedes the rest of the number (to the ''right'', since Hebrew is read from right to left).  There are no special marks to signify that the “count” is starting over with thousands, which can theoretically lead to ambiguity, although a single quote mark is sometimes used after the letter.  When specifying years of the Hebrew calendar in the present millennium, writers usually omit the thousands (which is presently 5 [{{lang|he|ה}}]), but if they do not this is accepted to mean 5 * 1000, with no ambiguity. The current Israeli coinage includes the thousands.{{clarify|date=June 2014}}

'''Inversive activities''' are processes which self internalise the action concerned. For example, a person who has an Inversive personality [[Internalization|internalises]] his [[emotion]]s from any exterior source. An inversive heat source would be a heat source where all the heat remains within the object and is not subject to any format of [[transference]] or [[externalisation]].

Is the opposite of Transversive activities and objects which suggest by their very nature that the outcome is transferred to the [[secondary source]].

'''Itche Goldberg''' ([[Yiddish]]: איטשע גאָלדבערג; March 22, 1904 – December 27, 2006) was a Polish-born [[Yiddish]] language writer of children's books, poet, [[librettist]], educator, [[literary critic]], camp director, publisher, fundraiser, essayist, literary editor, Yiddish language and culture scholar, and left-wing political activist. He devoted his life to the preservation of the Yiddish language and secular Yiddish culture.

==Early years==
Goldberg was born in [[Opatow]], [[Poland]], and moved to [[Warsaw]] in 1914, attending Poznanski Teachers Seminary. In 1920 he moved to [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, studying [[philosophy]], [[German language|German]] and [[political science]] at [[McMaster University]]. While in Toronto, he taught Yiddish at [[The Workmen's Circle/Arbeter Ring]] school; it was in Toronto that his [[leftist]]/pro-[[communist]] sympathies matured.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/llt/49/05reiter.html historycooperative.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517191242/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/llt/49/05reiter.html# |date=2006-05-17 }}; accessed January 31, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He moved to [[New York City]] in the late 1920s, and continued teaching Yiddish there as well as in [[Philadelphia]], but left the [[socialist]] [[The Workmen's Circle/Arbeter Ring|Workmen's Circle]] schools for the more [[Radicalization|radical]] ''Arbeter Ordn Shuln''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laits.utexas.edu/gottesman/abord.html Chapter Five: Yiddish Schools] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505045743/http://www.laits.utexas.edu/gottesman/abord.html# |date=2006-05-05 }}, laits.utexas.edu; accessed January 31, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The education schism, with Goldberg and many schools leaving the ''Arbeter Ring'' to form the ''Ordn'' network, was part of an exceedingly vituperative break within the leftist Yiddish community between the communists and socialists (who the communists sometimes called "social fascists").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/1376/ Once-feuding Blood Relatives, United in a Marriage of Ideals] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108224243/http://www.forward.com/articles/1376/# |date=2009-01-08 }}, Forward.com; accessed January 31, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yiddishist==

Passing on the Yiddish tradition to future generations was a mainstay of his life. From 1937 to 1951 he was editor of ''Yunvarg'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/gottesman/childlit.html|title=Chapter Seven : Yiddish Children's Journals|website=Laits.utexas.edu|accessdate=31 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403142208/http://laits.utexas.edu/gottesman/childlit.html#|archive-date=2017-04-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a children's magazine. He wrote many children's stories, and his book, ''Yiddish Stories for Young People'', is still being used at Workmen's Circle schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workmenscircleboston.org/2nd.htm|title=Workmen's Circle|website=Workmenscircleboston.org|accessdate=31 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912023429/http://www.workmenscircleboston.org/2nd.htm#|archive-date=2005-09-12|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1970 to 1985 he was professor of Yiddish language and literature at Queens College (C.U.N.Y.). He may be currently best known as editor from 1964 to 2004 of the longest running journal of [[Yiddish literature]], ''Yidishe Kultur''. The frequency of publication went down during this period, as Yiddish writers and speakers gradually died off. The final edition was published in 2004. Yet, he clung to the notion that Yiddish can still be a living language.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite news | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/681958381.html?dids=681958381:681958381&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Aug+22%2C+2004&amp;author=David+Kohn&amp;pub=The+Sun&amp;desc=Working+to+nurture+a+language+ | title=Working to nurture a language ; Yiddish: A centenarian puts out a literary journal six times a year | first=David | last=Kohn | date=2004-08-22 | access-date=2017-07-06 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214075300/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/681958381.html?dids=681958381:681958381&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Aug+22,+2004&amp;author=David+Kohn&amp;pub=The+Sun&amp;desc=Working+to+nurture+a+language+# | archive-date=2012-02-14 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He saw in the Yiddish/Jewish culture of Eastern Europe humanistic and progressive values. He felt that these were important, not religious ritual. He even criticized Nobel Prize–winning author I.B. Singer for not portraying these ideals in his writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/obituaries/03goldberg.html|title=Itche Goldberg, Yiddish Advocate, 102, Dies|first=Ari L.|last=Goldman|date=31 January 2018|accessdate=31 January 2018|website=Nytimes.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201020122/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/obituaries/03goldberg.html#|archive-date=2018-02-01|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leftist==
Goldberg, a secular [[Jew]], had been closely associated with left-wing causes for many years. There were probably several threads to his attraction to a radical cause. His close associates in Toronto were Communists, including his brother-in-law, who shared his revolutionary world view of social justice.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt; 

He saw the Soviet Union as the salvation for the Jewish national and social problems.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Also, he described an embedded rebelliousness in those doubly alienated, "suffering and benefiting from 'rejection [and persecution] by the Gentiles, but also their own rejection of the narrowness of the rabbi and merchant dominated shtetl life'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usask.ca/relst/jrpc/br10-lowereastside.html|title=University of Saskatchewan|website=Usask.ca|accessdate=31 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204055707/http://www.usask.ca/relst/jrpc/br10-lowereastside.html#|archive-date=2012-02-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after moving to [[New York City]], he became director of the ''Arbeter Ordn Shuln'', and helped set up a nationwide network of these schools, reaching a peak number of 140.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt; Best described as supplemental schools, they aimed at promoting Yiddish identity, as well as inculcating the concepts of [[class consciousness]] and [[social justice]]. Goldberg saw two function of the ''shuln''; "to revolutionize Yiddish education and to separate religion from education for the first time in Jewish history; and on the other hand to ensure that progressive secularism is carried forward from generation to generation."&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishcurrents.org/2006-nov-stillman.htm|title=Jewish Currents November 2006 - Itche Goldberg on Khayim Zhitlovsky|first=Yankl|last=Stillman|website=Jewishcurrents.org|accessdate=31 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116041454/http://www.jewishcurrents.org/2006-nov-stillman.htm#|archive-date=2016-01-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For decades beginning in the 1920s, including two as director, he was associated with [[Camp Kinderland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinderland.org/campkinderland/directors/1935itchiegoldberg.jpg|format=JPG|title=Photographic image|website=Kinderland.org|accessdate=31 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303183418/http://www.kinderland.org/campkinderland/directors/1935itchiegoldberg.jpg#|archive-date=2016-03-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kinderland.org/campkinderland/directors/directors.htm Camp Kinderland Alumni Association] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122712/http://www.kinderland.org/campkinderland/directors/directors.htm# |date=2007-09-27 }}, kinderland.org; accessed January 31, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  known as a "[[red diaper baby]]" camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinderland.org/sylvanlake/pictures/hopnobbing/1949paulrobeson1.htm|title=Camp Kinderland Alumni Association|website=Kinderland.org|accessdate=31 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181924/http://www.kinderland.org/sylvanlake/pictures/hopnobbing/1949paulrobeson1.htm#|archive-date=2016-03-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinderland.org/sylvanlake/pictures/1930s/images/1932group.jpg|format=JPG|title=Photographic image|website=Kinderland.org|accessdate=31 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174811/http://www.kinderland.org/sylvanlake/pictures/1930s/images/1932group.jpg#|archive-date=2016-03-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1937-51, he was national school and cultural director of the [[Jewish People's Fraternal Order]], a branch of the pro-Communist [[International Workers Order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jewishcurrents.org/itche-goldberg-and-yiddishkayt/|title=Itche Goldberg and Yiddishkayt|date=2017-12-27|work=Jewish Currents|access-date=2018-02-22|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227021750/http://jewishcurrents.org/itche-goldberg-and-yiddishkayt/#|archive-date=2017-12-27|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak after [[World War II]] the JPFO had 50,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlib.nyu.edu:8083/tamwagead/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=iwo.xml&amp;style=saxon01t2002.xsl|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2006-05-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519132923/http://dlib.nyu.edu:8083/tamwagead/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=iwo.xml&amp;style=saxon01t2002.xsl|archivedate=2006-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the IWO was about to be liquidated during the Red Scare in 1954 by the Department of Insurance of New York State (IWO was a fiscally sound fraternal benefit insurance company with close 200,000 members in its peak years, 1946–47), Itche withdrew the Yiddish shules from the JPFO in order to preserve them, creating the independent Service Bureau for Jewish Education so that the schools could continue to function. In the anti-left atmosphere of the period, this effort was only partially successful.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Over time he made a transition to [[democratic socialism]], eventually seeing the [[Soviet Union]] as an anti-model. By the 1950s his enthusiasm for the Soviet Union had completely evaporated, particularly after the Soviets executed Jewish writers in 1952.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/?en/press/1216.htm Editor strives to save Yiddish journal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203914/http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/?en%2Fpress%2F1216.htm# |date=2007-09-27 }}, raoulwallenberg.net; accessed January 31, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, he remained a central figure in the [[Jewish left]] for decades. Goldberg wrote and lectured frequently on the proud Jewish content he found in the works of such Soviet Yiddish writers as [[Perets Markish]], [[Dovid Hofshteyn]], and [[Dovid Bergelson]]. The [[Yidisher Kultur Farband]] (YKUF) in whose leadership Goldberg served for many years published numerous works by these authors when other Yiddish publishers in the west rejected them as outside of the Yiddish canon.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Centenary== 
In honor of his 100th birthday the Jewish People's Philharmonic Chorus had a concert which included a musical adaptation of [[I.L. Peretz]]'s "''Oyb Nit Nokh Hekher''", with [[libretto]] by Itche Goldberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klezmershack.com/calendar/2004_06.php|title=KlezCalendar: June 2004 Archives|website=Klezmershack.com|accessdate=31 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425061420/http://www.klezmershack.com/calendar/2004_06.php#|archive-date=2018-04-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another 100th tribute, [[Jerrold Nadler]] honored him in the [[United States House of Representatives]] by saying: "''Mir shatsn op ayer vunderlekhe arbet l'toyves der yidisher kultur vos hot baraikhert dem gontsn Yiddishn yishev''." ([[English language|English]] translation ``We honor your wonderful work for the benefit of Yiddish culture which enriches all of Yiddish heritage.'')

==Death==
He died at age 102. His last book was ''Essayen Tsvey'' (''Essays Two'') in 2004, when he was 100 years. In honor of this publication, a commemoration of his life was held on July 25, 2006, sponsored by YIVO and League for Yiddish. A Josh Wiletsky documentary was made of his life at age 101, "Itche Goldberg, A Century Of Yiddish Letters",&lt;ref&gt;[http://savethemusic.com/yiddish/releases.html The Yiddish Music Hall: recent Releases] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129155147/http://www.savethemusic.com/yiddish/releases.html# |date=2006-11-29 }}, savethemusic.com; accessed January 31, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and was shown at this event.

'''Johannes Linnankoski''' (originally '''Vihtori Johan Peltonen''', 18 October 1869, [[Askola]] – 10 August 1913) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] author. His most famous work is the sensual ''Laulu tulipunaisesta kukasta''. His primary themes were exploring guilt, punishment and redemption as moral questions.

His books have been made into numerous major feature films with the most famous (or notorious) being ''Hilja maitotyttö'' (directed by [[Teuvo Tulio]]) and ''Laulu tulipunaisesta kukasta'' – "The Song of the Blood-Red Flower" – (directed by [[Mikko Niskanen]]). "The Song of the Blood-Red Flower" has also been filmed in Sweden, in three different versions by directors [[Mauritz Stiller]], [[Per-Axel Branner]] and [[Gustaf Molander]].

Linnankoski was also active in the cultural life of [[Eastern Uusimaa]]. He was one of the founders of the bank in [[Porvoo]] and also founded Finnish-language schools and daily newspapers such as ''[[Uusimaa (newspaper)|Uusimaa]]'', the first Finnish-language newspaper situated outside of the major towns of Uusimaa.

In 1938 a Linnankoski museum was opened, close to the [[sauna]] building where Linnankoski supposedly was born.

'''Lambdacism''' (from the [[Greek letter]] [[lambda|''λ'']]) is a [[medical condition]] or [[speech impediment]] related to the pronunciation of /[[l]]/ or related [[phoneme]]s. In general, /[[r]]/ is usually substituted instead of /l/, as seen in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and historically in [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]], where the reflexes of [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] phonemes /*l/ and /*r/ and their syllabic variants are all realized as /*r/ or /*r̥/.

A common form of lambdacism is [[lallation]], the substitution of /[[l]]/ for /[[ɹ]]/ in pronunciation. It is a common feature of [[Engrish|Japanese]] and Korean [[Non-native pronunciations of English|pronunciation of English]]. Substitution of /l/ for /n/ at the beginning of a word or syllable (or the reverse at the end) is also a feature in certain East Asian languages, such as Vietnamese (Northern dialect), [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] and [[Thai language|Thai]].

'''''Language As Symbolic Action: Essays on Life, Literature and Method''''' is a book by [[Kenneth Burke]], published in 1966 by the [[University of California Press]].&lt;ref&gt;Blakesley, David and Clarke Rountree.  “Works by Kenneth Burke.”  ''K.B. Journal''.  2010. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kbjournal.org/worksbykb |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115080432/http://www.kbjournal.org/worksbykb |archivedate=2010-11-15 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;   As indicated by the title, the book, Burke's 16th published work, consists of “many of Burke's essays which have appeared in widely diverse periodicals” and has thus been regarded as one of the most significant resources for studying and comprehending [[Kenneth Burke|Burke]]’s ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Nelson J. III.  “Review: [untitled].”  Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric 1.3 (1968): 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview of Book ==
''Language as Symbolic Action'' is divided into three parts:  (1) Five Summarizing Essays (2) Particular Works and Authors and (3) Further Essays on Symbolism in General.

=== Five Summarizing Essays ===
The first of [[Kenneth Burke|Burke]]’s five essays is the “[[Definition of man]]” which defines man as 

&lt;blockquote&gt;. . .the symbol-using (symbol-making, symbol-misusing) animal, inventor of the negative (or moralized by the negative), separated from his natural condition by instruments of his own making, goaded by the spirit of hierarchy (or moved by the sense of order), and rotten with perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth.  Language as Symbolic Action:  Essays on Life, Literature, and Method.  (Berkeley:  University of California Press, 1966) 16.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The next chapter “Poetics in Particular, Language in General” returns to a discussion of perfection continued from the previous chapter.  [[Kenneth Burke|Burke]] summarizes this chapter by stating: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The poetic motive does indeed come to a head in the principle of perfection . . . But the principle of perfection should not be viewed in too simple a sense.  We should also use the expression ironically . . . the motive of perfection may extend to areas far beyond the confines of poetry and poetics.&lt;ref&gt;Burke 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Osborn explains this concept further: “. . . a truly rigorous attempt to account for a single work on the grounds of poetics alone should force recognition that it is necessary to go beyond poetics-in-particular to language-in-general. . .”&lt;ref&gt;Osborn, Neal J.  “Toward the Quintessential Burke.”  The Hudson Review 21.2 (1968): 320.&lt;/ref&gt;   Perfection, according to Burke and similar scholars, is a motive that exists both in literature and beyond, as an underlying human desire that drives much symbolic action.

The third and often-referenced chapter “[[Terministic Screens]]” makes use of many key terms of Burke’s “dramatistic” approach to literary and rhetorical criticism.  [[Kenneth Burke|Burke]] begins the chapter by explaining the “scientistic” and the “dramatistic.”  “‘A scientistic approach begins with questions of naming, or definition’(44).  A ‘dramatistic’ approach stresses ‘language as an aspect of ‘action,’ that is, symbolic action’(44).”&lt;ref&gt;Wessels, Emanuelle, Justin Killian, and Sean Larson.  “Outlines of Kenneth Burke’s Writings: Language as Symbolic Action.”  Resources on Kenneth Burke. 12 May 2009. &lt; http://www.comm.umn.edu/burke/LASA.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;   Burke explains that, through the concept of [[terministic screens]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;“any nomenclature necessarily directs the attention into some channels rather than others.”  This can be obvious, such as how different academic subjects direct the attention, or more subtle.  Burke illustrates the latter point with an example of how photos of the same objects using different color filters reflected and deflected his attention in different ways, depending on the filter (45).&lt;ref&gt;Wessels, Emanuelle, Justin Killian, and Sean Larson.  “Outlines of Kenneth Burke’s Writings: Language as Symbolic Action.”  Resources on Kenneth Burke. 12 May 2009. &lt; http://www.comm.umn.edu/burke/LASA.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Terministic screens]] is significant to the process of rhetorical criticism, as well as understanding [[rhetoric]], because [[terministic screens]] are a conduit to understanding reality.

=== Particular Works and Authors ===

The 11 chapters comprising Part II engage in rhetorical criticism of, among others, [[Shakespeare]]’s ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', the ''[[Oresteia]]'', ''[[Faust]]'', and [[William Carlos Williams]].

=== Further Essays on Symbolism in General ===

Part III consists of eight chapters.  One of the more significant of these is chapter six, entitled “Medium as Message.”  [[Kenneth Burke|Burke]] takes one of his peers, [[Marshall McLuhan]], to task for focusing too much on the media rather than the symbolic resources of language.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;Burke’s main criticism of McLuhan stems from his most memorable slogan and the undue emphasis put on medium.  “If the medium is the message, obviously the important thing is not what somebody says in a given medium, but what medium he uses, regardless of what he says. . . The medium is the message.  Hence, down with content analysis” (413).&lt;ref&gt;Wessels, Emanuelle, Justin Killian, and Sean Larson.  “Outlines of Kenneth Burke’s Writings: Language as Symbolic Action.”  Resources on Kenneth Burke. 12 May 2009. &lt; http://www.comm.umn.edu/burke/LASA.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Kenneth Burke|Burke]] continues the discussion on the relative importance of medium to message by acknowledging the relationship as significant and stating that certain content can be better delivered by or suited to a specific medium.&lt;ref&gt;Wessels, Emanuelle, Justin Killian, and Sean Larson.  “Outlines of Kenneth Burke’s Writings: Language as Symbolic Action.”  Resources on Kenneth Burke. 12 May 2009. &lt; http://www.comm.umn.edu/burke/LASA.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

[[Kenneth Burke|Burke]]’s ideas, through these significant essays, have had widespread influence.  Burke scholar Nelson J. Smith III offered this review: “Much of what our current generation of rhetoricians accomplishes will be drawn from the preliminary and pioneer investigations into the sociology of ideology by Kenneth Burke.”&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Nelson J. III.  “Review: [untitled].”  Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric 1.3 (1968): 189.&lt;/ref&gt;   Frederick J. Hoffman also writes:  “[Burke’s] range and scope are truly remarkable. If there are predecessors and contemporaries in this respect, they are probably Remy de Gourmont. . .and Eric Auerbach. . . His fate is that of a man some years ahead of his time.”&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Frederick J. “Review: Kenneth Burke’s Great Range.” Poetry 111.6 (1968): 418.&lt;/ref&gt;   The range of critical ideas and practices included in ''Language as Symbolic Action'' help scholars explore this breadth.

The '''Lau language''' is a [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian group language]] spoken on northeast [[Malaita]] of the [[Solomon Islands]]. In 1999 it had about 16,937 first-language speakers, with a large number of second-language speakers through Malaitan communities in the Solomon Islands, especially in [[Honiara]].

{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}

The '''longest word''' in any given language depends on the [[word formation]] rules of each specific language, and on the types of words allowed for consideration. 

[[Agglutinative language]]s allow for the creation of long words via [[compound (linguistics)|compounding]].   Words consisting of hundreds, or even thousands of characters have been [[Neologism|coined]].  Even non-agglutinative languages may allow word formation of theoretically limitless length in certain contexts. An example common to many languages in the term for a very remote ancestor, "great-great-.....-grandfather", where the prefix "great-" may be repeated any number of times.

[[Systematic name]]s of [[chemical compound]]s can run to hundreds of thousands of characters in length. The rules of creation of such names are commonly defined by international bodies, therefore they formally belong to many languages.  The longest recognized systematic  name is for the protein [[titin]], at 189,819 letters.&lt;ref name="urlSarah McCulloch"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sarahmcculloch.com/luminary-uprise/2009/longest-word/ | title = Longest word in English | vauthors = McCulloch S |  work = Sarah McCulloch.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114221953/http://www.sarahmcculloch.com/luminaryuprise/longest-word.html |archivedate=2010-01-14 | accessdate = 2016-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   While [[List of lexicographers|lexicographers]] regard generic names of [[chemical compound]]s as ''verbal [[Chemical formula|formulae]]'' rather than words,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Oxford Word and Language Service team | title = Ask the experts - What is the longest English word? | publisher = AskOxford.com / [[Oxford University Press]] | url = http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutwords/longestword | accessdate = 2008-01-13 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080913173417/http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutwords/longestword | archive-date = 2008-09-13 | dead-url = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its sheer length the systematic name for titin is often included in longest-word lists.

Longest word candidates may be judged by their acceptance in major [[dictionaries]] such as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' or in record-keeping publications like ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', and by the frequency of their use in ordinary language.

{{TOC right}}

== Afrikaans ==
[[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], as it is a [[daughter language]] of the [[Dutch language]], is capable of forming compounds of potentially limitless length in the same way as in the Dutch language. According to the Total Book of South African Records, the longest word in the language is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenthal|first=Eric|title=Total Book of South African records|year=1982|publisher=Delta Books|isbn=0-908387-19-9|page=61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h_QMAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=editions:ISBN0908387199}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{lang|af|Tweedehandsemotorverkoopsmannevakbondstakingsvergaderingsameroeperstoespraakskrywerspersverklaringuitreikingsmediakonferensieaankondiging}} (136 letters), which means "issuable media conference's announcement at a press release regarding the convener's speech at a secondhand car dealership union's strike meeting". This word, however, is contrived to be long and does not occur in everyday speech or writing.

== Basque ==
The longest Basque [[toponym]] is ''{{lang|eu|Azpilicuetagaraicosaroyarenberecolarrea}}'' (39).&lt;ref&gt;{{eu}} Iñaki Arranz, ''Hitza azti'', Alberdania, 2006, 283 pages. (Zein da euskal hitzik luzeena?)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bulgarian ==
The Bulgarian online  etymological dictionary claims that longest word in Bulgarian to be the 39-letter-long {{lang|bg|непротивоконституционствувателствувайте}} (''{{lang|bg|neprotivokonstitutsionstvuvatelstvuvayte}}''),  introduced in the Constitution of Bulgaria of 1947 ([[Dimitrov Constitution]]). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rechnik.info/%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%83%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D1%83%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D1%83%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%B9%D1%82%D0%B5|title=непротивоконституционствувателствувайте|publisher=rechnik.info|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word means "do not perform actions against the constitution" (addressed to more than one person).

==Catalan==
The longest word in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] is considered to be ''{{lang|ca|Anticonstitucionalment}}'', an adverb meaning "[done in a way that is] against the constitution", however, the scientific word ''{{lang|ca|Psiconeuroimmunoendocrinologia}}'', related to [[endocrinology]] has been proposed by the [[University of Barcelona]] to be the true longest word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ub.edu/vocabularia/archives/3214|title=Psiconeuroimmunoendocrinologia: la paraula més llarga de la UB? – Vocabulària|website=www.ub.edu|language=ca|access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Danish ==
Longer words can be created as Danish grammar allows its user to put nouns together, forming brand new words, making it possible for a word to be arbitrarily long.

For instance, in the fairy tale [[The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep]], the author [[Hans Christian Andersen]] named one of the characters ''{{lang|da|Gedebukkebensoverogundergeneralkrigskommandersergenten}}'' ("General-clothes-press-inspector-head-superintendent-Goat-legs" or in literal translation "the goaty-legged-above-and-under-general-war-commanding-sergeant") as a parody on the long Danish military titles. This word is 54 letters long.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== Dutch ==
[[Dutch language|Dutch]], like many [[Germanic languages]], is capable of forming compounds of potentially limitless length. The 53-letter word ''Kindercarnavalsoptochtvoorbereidingswerkzaamhedenplan'', meaning "preparation activities plan for a children's carnival procession", was cited by the 1996 [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the longest Dutch word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francesfarmersrevenge.com/stuff/oddities/words11.html|title=A Collection of Word Oddities and Trivia|publisher=francesfarmersrevenge.com|accessdate=7 March 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427085234/http://www.francesfarmersrevenge.com/stuff/oddities/words11.html|archivedate=27 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest word in the authoritative [[Van Dale]] Dutch dictionary (2009 edition) ''in plural form'' is ''{{lang|nl|meervoudigepersoonlijkheidsstoornissen}}'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://levenslangleren.be/taal.php/wat-is-het-langste-woord-in-het-nederlands|title=Wat is het langste woord in het Nederlands|work=levenslangleren.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; 38 letters long, meaning "multiple personality disorders". The entry in the dictionary however is in the singular, counting 35 letters.

The free OpenTaal dictionary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opentaal.org|title=Welkom bij OpenTaal|work=opentaal.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been certified by the [[Dutch Language Union]] (the official Dutch language institute) and is included in many open-source applications, contains the following longest words, which are 40 letters long:
* ''{{lang|nl|vervoerdersaansprakelijkheidsverzekering}}'',  "carriers' liability insurance";
* ''{{lang|nl|bestuurdersaansprakelijkheidsverzekering}}'', "drivers' liability insurance";
* ''{{lang|nl|overeenstemmingsbeoordelingsprocedures}}'', "conformity assessment procedures" (38 letters)

The word often said to be the longest in Dutch – probably because of its funny meaning and alliteration – which has also appeared in print, is ''{{lang|nl|Hottentottensoldatententententoonstellingsbouwterrein}}'' ("construction ground for the Hottentot soldiers' tents exhibition"); counting 53 letters.

{{Main article|Longest word in English}}

The 45-letter word [[pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis]] is the longest English word that appears in a major dictionary.&lt;ref name= oxlong/&gt;

[[Antidisestablishmentarianism (word)|Antidisestablishmentarianism]], at 28 letters, is the longest non-coined, [[systematic name|non-systematic]] English word in  Oxford Dictionaries.&lt;ref name= oxlong&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/what-is-the-longest-english-word "What is the longest English word?"] (oxforddictionaries.com)&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to a 19th-century political movement that opposed the disestablishment of the [[Church of England]] as the [[State religion|state church]] of England.

[[wiktionary:floccinaucinihilipilification|Floccinaucinihilipilification]], at 29 letters and meaning the act of estimating something as being worth so little as to be practically valueless, or the habit of doing so, is the longest non-technical, coined word in Oxford Dictionaries of the English language.&lt;ref name= oxlong/&gt;

== Esperanto ==
The longest official [[Esperanto]] roots are 12 letters long, shown here with the added substantive "-o" ending:
*''{{lang|eo|administracio}}'' (administration),
*''{{lang|eo|aŭtobiografio}}'' (autobiography),
*''{{lang|eo|diskriminacii}}'' (to discriminate),
*''{{lang|eo|konservatorio}}'' (conservatory),
*''{{lang|eo|paleontologio}}'' (palaeontology),
*''{{lang|eo|paralelogramo}}'' (parallelogram), and

Since Esperanto allows word compounding, there are no limits on how long a word can theoretically become. A relatively short example is the 46-letter ''{{lang|eo|komencopaleontologiokonservatoriaĉestriĝontajn}}'', which is an (accusative and plural) adjective that means "about to begin to become the leader of a contemptible palaeontology conservatory". (Such clusters are not considered good style, but are permissible under the rules of [[Esperanto grammar]].){{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== Finnish ==
Three examples of long words that have been in everyday use in the Finnish language are {{lang|fi|kolmivaihekilowattituntimittari}} which means "three phase kilowatt hour meter" (31 letters), {{lang|fi|peruspalveluliikelaitoskuntayhtymä}} ("a public utility of a municipal federation for provision of basic services", 34 letters)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llky.fi/|title=Suupohjan peruspalveluliikelaitoskuntayhtymä – LLKY|work=llky.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|fi|lentokonesuihkuturbiinimoottoriapumekaanikkoaliupseerioppilas}} "airplane jet turbine engine auxiliary mechanic non-commissioned officer student" (61 letters), an actual military term, although one which has been deprecated. If conjugated forms are allowed, even longer real words can be made. Allowing derivatives and [[clitic]]s allows the already lengthy word to grow even longer, although the usability of the word starts to degrade. Because Finnish uses free forming of composite words, new words can even be formed during a conversation. One can add nouns after each other without breaking grammar rules.

If one allows artificial constructs as well as using clitics and conjugated forms, one can create even longer words: such as {{lang|fi|kumarreksituteskenteleentuvaisehkollaismaisekkuudellisenneskenteluttelemattomammuuksissansakaankopahan}} (102 letters), which was created by Artturi Kannisto.&lt;ref&gt;Karilas, Yrjö: Antero Vipunen, arvoitusten ja ongelmien, leikkien ja pelien sekä eri harrastelualojen pikkujättiläinen, p. 226, 20th edition. WSOY 2003. {{ISBN|9510121770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest non-compound (a single stem with prefixes and suffixes) Finnish word recognised by the Guinness Book of Records is {{lang|fi|epäjärjestelmällistyttämättömyydellänsäkäänköhän}} (see also [[Agglutination#Extremes]]), based on the stem {{lang|fi|järki}} (reason, sanity), and it means: I wonder if – even with his/her quality of not having been made unsystematized

{{lang|fi|[[Äteritsiputeritsipuolilautatsijänkä]]}} and a defunct bar named after it, {{lang|fi|Äteritsiputeritsipuolilautatsi-baari}}, are the longest place names in use.

==French==
{{main|Longest word in French}}

== German ==
In German, [[integer|whole numbers]] (smaller than 1 million) can be expressed as single words, which makes {{lang|de|siebenhundertsiebenundsiebzigtausendsiebenhundertsiebenundsiebzig}} (777,777) a 65 letter word. In combination with {{lang|de|-malig}} or, as an inflected noun, {{lang|de|(des …) -maligen}}, all numbers can be written as one word. A 79 letter word, {{lang|de|[[Donaudampfschiffahrtselektrizitätenhauptbetriebswerkbauunterbeamtengesellschaft]]}}, was named the longest published word in the German language by the 1972 [[Guinness Book of World Records]], but longer words are possible.  The word was the name of a prewar Viennese club for subordinate officials of the headquarters of the electrical division of the company named the {{lang|de|[[Donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaft]]}}, which operated steam boats on the [[Danube]] river.

The longest word that is not created artificially as a longest-word record seems to be {{lang|de|[[Rinderkennzeichnungs- und Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz|Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz]]}} at 63 letters. The word means "law delegating beef label monitoring" but as of 2013, it was removed from the books because European Union regulations have changed and that particular law became obsolete, leading to news reports that Germany "had lost its longest word".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/06/03/law_change_spells_end_for_germanys_longest_word_ap/|title=Law change spells end for Germany's longest word|author=Associated Press|work=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016 the 51-letter word ''{{lang|de|[[Bundespräsidentenstichwahlwiederholungsverschiebung]]}}'' ("deferral of the second iteration of the federal presidential run-off election") was elected the Austrian Word of the Year 2016.&lt;ref name="TheLocal"&gt;[http://www.thelocal.at/20161209/austria-chooses-its-word-of-the-year Austria chooses its Word of the Year], The Local, 9&amp;nbsp;Dec. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The jury called it a "descriptive word" which "in terms of its content as well as its length, is a symbol and an ironic form of commentary for the political events of this year, characterized by the very long campaign for the presidential election, the challenges of the voting process, and its reiteration."&lt;ref name="TheLocal" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oedeutsch.at/OEWORT/2016/01_Begr16/Pressemitteilung-Oewort%202016.pdf Presseerklärung der Jury zur Wahl des Österreichischen Worts des Jahres], Forschungsstelle Österreichisches Deutsch, 9&amp;nbsp;Dec. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Greek ==
In his comedy ''[[Assemblywomen]]'' (c. 392 BC), [[Aristophanes]] coined the 173-letter word {{lang|el|[[Lopadotemachoselachogaleokranioleipsanodrimhypotrimmatosilphioparaomelitokatakechymenokichlepikossyphophattoperisteralektryonoptekephalliokigklopeleiolagoiosiraiobaphetraganopterygon]]}}, a fictional food dish consisting of a combination of fish and other meat. The word is cited as the longest ancient Greek word ever written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = De Luca | first = Kenneth M. | title = Aristophanes’ male and female revolutions : a reading of Aristophanes’ Knights and Assemblywomen | publisher=Lexington Books | year = 2005 | location = Lanham, MD | pages = 124 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vXj70WVFw58C&amp;pg=PA124 | isbn = 978-0-7391-0833-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A modern Greek word of 22 letters is {{lang|el|ηλεκτροεγκεφαλογράφημα}} ({{lang|el|ilektroenkefalográfima}}) (gen. {{lang|el|ηλεκτροεγκεφαλογραφήματος}} ({{lang|el|ilektroenkefalografímatos}}), 25 letters) meaning "electroencephalogram".

== Hungarian ==
''{{lang|hu|Megszentségteleníthetetlenségeskedéseitekért}}'', with 44 letters is one example of a long word in the [[Hungarian language]] and means something like "for your [plural] continued behaviour as if you could not be desecrated". It is already morphed, since Hungarian is an [[agglutinative language]]. The language does not have a "longest word" due to its agglutinating nature. It is always possible to construct a longer one with enough creativity. For example, ''{{lang|hu|legösszetettebbszóhosszúságvilágrekorddöntéskényszerneurózistünetegyüttesmegnyilvánulásfejleszthetőségvizsgálataitokról}}'' (119 letters), which means: "About your investigations of the upgradeability of the manifestation of the syndrome of the neurosis about the need to decide which is the world record of the most complex longest word."{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The longest dictionary form word is the word in use (although it is constructed from the word: ''szent'' meaning: "saint"), ''{{lang|hu|megszentségteleníthetetlen}}'', with 25 characters, and means "something that cannot be desecrated".{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== Icelandic ==
Icelandic has the ability to form compounds of arbitrary length by stringing together [[genitive]]s ({{lang|is|eignarfallssamsetning}}), so no single words of maximal length exist in the language. However, {{lang|is|vaðlaheiðarvegavinnuverkfærageymsluskúr}} and {{lang|is|vaðlaheiðarvegavinnuverkfærageymsluskúraútidyralyklakippuhringur}} are sometimes cited as particularly long words;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Helgason|first=Haukur Már|title=Hvernig hljóðar lengsta orð í heimi á íslensku?|url=http://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=979|work=Vísindavefurinn|publisher=University of Iceland|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter has 64 letters and means "a keychain ring for the outdoor key of road workers shed in a moor called Vaðlaheiði".

Analysis of a corpus of contemporary Icelandic texts by Uwe Quasthoff, Sabine Fiedler and Erla Hallsteinsdóttir identified {{lang|is|Alþjóðaflutningaverkamannasambandsins}} ("of the International Transport Workers' Federation"; 37 letters) and {{lang|is|Norðvestur-Atlantshafsfiskveiðistofnunarinnar}} ("of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries' Organization"; 45 letters) as the longest unhyphenated and hyphenated words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Uwe|editor1-last=Quasthoff|editor2-first=Sabine|editor2-last=Fiedler|editor3-first=Erla|editor3-last=Hallsteinsdóttir|title=Frequency Dictionary Icelandic / Íslensk tíðniorðabók|date=2012-05-14|isbn=978-3-86583-656-4|publisher=Leipziger Universitätsverlag|oclc=808247819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest word occurring at least twice in the [[University of Leipzig]] ''isl-is_web_2015'' corpus is {{lang|is|Auðmannastjórnvaldaembættisstjórnmálaverkalýðsverðlausraverðbréfaábyrgðarlausrakvótaræningjaaftaníossaspilling}} (110 letters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cls.corpora.uni-leipzig.de/de/isl-is_web_2015/3.5.6_Longest%20Words.html|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Italian ==
The longest word in Italian is traditionally ''{{lang|it|precipitevolissimevolmente}}'', which is a 26-letter-long adverb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c_E9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA884 |title=Dizionario della lingua italiana ...|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is formed by subsequent addition of postfixes to the original root:
# ''{{lang|it|precipitevole}}'': "hasty";
# ''{{lang|it|precipitevolissimo}}'': "very hasty";
# ''{{lang|it|precipitevolissimevole}}'': "[of someone/something] that acts very hastily", (not grammatically correct);
# ''{{lang|it|precipitevolissimevolmente}}'': "in a way like someone/something that acts very hastily" (not grammatically correct, but nowadays part of the language).

The word is never used in every-day language, but in jokes. Nevertheless, it is an official part of Italian language; it was coined in 1677 by poet [[Francesco Moneti]]:
{{quote|''finché alla terra alfin torna repente /
precipitevolissimevolmente''|Francesco Moneti, ''Cortona Convertita'', canto III, LXV}}
The word technically violates Italian grammar rules, the correct form being ''precipitevolissimamente'', which is three letters and one syllable shorter. The poet coined the new word to have 11 syllables in the second verse.

Other words can be created with a similar (and grammatically correct) mechanism starting from a longer root, winding up with a longer word. Some examples are:
* ''{{lang|it|sovramagnificentissimamente}}'' (cited by [[Dante Alighieri]] in ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]''), 27 letters, "in a way that is more than magnificent by far" (archaic);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/dante/vulgar2.shtml|title=Dante: De Vulgari Eloquentia II|publisher=|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''{{lang|it|incontrovertibilissimamente}}'', 27 letters, "in a way that is very difficult to falsify";
* ''{{lang|it|particolareggiatissimamente}}'', 27 letters, "in an extremely detailed way";
* ''{{lang|it|anticostituzionalissimamente}}'', 28 letters, "in a way that strongly violates the constitution".

The longest accepted neologism is ''{{lang|it|psiconeuroendocrinoimmunologia}}'' (30 letters).{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.

Other long words are:
* ''{{lang|it|hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliofobia}}'' (35 letters)
* ''{{lang|it|nonilfenossipolietilenossietonolo}}''  (33 letters)
* ''{{lang|it|pentagonododecaedrotetraedrico}}''  (30 letters)
* ''{{lang|it|esofagodermatodigiunoplastica}}''  (29 letters)
* ''{{lang|it|elettroencefalograficamente}}''  (27 letters)
* ''{{lang|it|diclorodifeniltricloroetano}}''  (27 letters)
* ''{{lang|it|intradermopalpebroreazione}}''  (26 letters).

== Korean ==
There is some disagreement about what is the longest word in the [[Korean language]]. The longest word appearing in the ''Standard Korean Dictionary'' published by the [[National Institute of the Korean Language]] is {{lang|ko|청자양인각연당초상감모란문은구대접}} ({{lang|ko-Hani|靑瓷陽印刻蓮唐草象嵌牡丹文銀釦대접}}); [[Revised Romanization of Korean|Revised Romanization]]: ''{{lang|ko|cheongjayang-in-gakyeondangchosang-gammoranmuneun-gudaejeop}}'', which is a kind of ceramic bowl from the [[Goryeo]] dynasty; that word is 17 [[hangul#Morpho-syllabic blocks|syllable blocks]] long, and contains a total of 46 [[hangul]] letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=http://krdic.naver.com/detail.nhn?docid=37415500|chapter=청자양인각연당초상감모란문은구대접|title=Naver Dictionary|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;!-- this is for the definition --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.joins.com/news/article/article.asp?total_id=11709502&amp;ctg=1200|title=독일에서 가장 긴 단어 사라진다|trans-title=Longest word in Germany disappears|work=[[JoongAng Ilbo]]|date=4 June 2013|accessdate=6 August 2015}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;!-- this is the secondary source which states that it might be the longest word but there's a dispute --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The term {{lang|ko|니코틴아마이드 아데닌 다이뉴클레오타이드}} ({{lang|ko|nikotin-amaideu adenin dainyukeulle-otaideu}}), a phonetic transcription of "[[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]]", has a larger number of syllable blocks (19) but a smaller number of letters (41), and also might not qualify as a single word due to the spaces.

In [[proper noun]]s, many Korean monarchs have long [[posthumous name]]s built from many different Sino-Korean nouns describing their positive characteristics, for example [[Sunjo of Joseon]], whose full posthumous name is the 77-syllable-block {{lang|ko|순조선각연덕현도경인순희체성응명흠광석경계천배극융원돈휴의행소윤희화준렬대중지정홍훈철모건시태형창운홍기고명박후강건수정계통수력공유범문안무정영경성효대왕}} ({{lang|ko|sunjoseongag-yeondeoghyeondogyeong-insunhuicheseong-eungmyeongheumgwangseoggyeong-gyecheonbaegeug-yung-wondonhyuuihaengsoyunhuihwajunlyeoldaejungjijeonghonghuncheolmogeonsitaehyeongchang-unhong-gigomyeongbaghugang-geonsujeong-gyetongsulyeoggong-yubeommun-anmujeong-yeong-gyeongseonghyodaewang}}).{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The longest Lithuanian word is 40 letters long:
* ''{{lang|lt|nebeprisikiškiakopūstlapiaujančiuosiuose}}'' - "in those, of masculine gender, who aren't gathering enough wood sorrel's leaves by themselves anymore." - the plural locative case of past iterative active participle of verb ''{{lang|lt|kiškiakopūstlapiauti}}'' meaning "to pick wood-sorrels' leaves" (leaves of edible forest plant with sour taste, word by word translation "rabbit cabbage"). The word is attributed to software developer / writer Andrius Stašauskas.&lt;ref&gt;http://jeff560.tripod.com/words11.html{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teoti.com/geek/10217-loooooooong-words.html{{unreliable source?|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mongolian ==
Mongolian is an [[agglutinative]] language. Words can get longer by adding suffixes. So, the longest suffixed word in Mongolian is "{{lang|mn|Цахилгаанжуулалтыхантайгаа}}" ({{lang|mn|tsakhilgaanjuulaltykhantaigaa}}) which is 26 letters long. Here is a table showing, with translations, which suffixes are added.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== Ojibwe==

The longest word in [[Ojibwe language]] is "{{lang|oj|miinibaashkiminasiganibiitoosijiganibadagwiingweshiganibakwezhigan}}" (66 letters), meaning ''[[blueberry pie]]''. This literally translates to "blueberry cooked to jellied preserve that lies in layers in which the face is covered in bread".&lt;ref&gt;[http://anishinaabemodaa.com/lessons?category_id=17 "Grammar Pro"], a page of the  collaborative Anishinaabe language revitalization effort&lt;/ref&gt;

== Polish ==
Very long Polish words can be created as [[adjective]]s from [[numeral system|numerals]] and nouns. For example, ''{{lang|pl|Dziewięćsetdziewięćdziesięciodziewięcionarodowościowego}}'', 54 letters, is the genitive singular form of an adjective meaning roughly "of nine-hundred and ninety-nine nationalities". Similar words are rather artificial compounds, constructed within allowed grammar rules, but are seldom used in spoken language, although they are not nonsense words.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} It is possible to make even longer words in this way, for example:

''{{lang|pl|Dziewięćsetdziewięćdziesiątdziewięćmiliardówdziewięćsetdziewięćdziesiątdziewięćmilionówdziewięćsetdziewięćdziesiątdziewięćtysięcydziewięćsetdziewięćdziesięciodziewięcioletniego}}'' (176 letters, meaning "of 999,999,999,999 years old").

One of the longest common words is 31-letter ''{{lang|pl|dziewięćdziesięciokilkuletniemu}}'' – the dative singular form of "ninety-and-some years old one". Another common long word is ''{{lang|pl|pięćdziesięciogroszówka}}'' (23 letters), "a 50 [[grosz]]y coin".{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== Russian ==
Theoretically, it is possible to create Russian words of unlimited length, for example: {{lang|ru|прапрапра...дедушка}} (''{{lang|ru|praprapra...dedushka}}'', great great great...grandfather).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Most likely one of the longest, originally Russian words is {{lang|ru|превысокомногорассмотрительствующий}} (''{{lang|ru|prevysokomnogorassmotritel'stvuyushchiy}}''), which contains 35 letters. "[It] is an adjective in the bureaucratic language of the 19th century meaning a very polite form of addressing clerks, something like Your Excellency, Your Highness, Your Majesty all together"(Guinness World Records 2003{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}). Its [[dative]] [[singular number|singular]] form, {{lang|ru|превысокомногорассмотрительствующему}} (''{{lang|ru|prevysokomnogorassmotritel'stvuyushchemu}}'', with 36 letters) can be an example of excessively official vocabulary of the 19th century. 

Numeral compounds can be long as well, such as {{lang|ru|Тысячевосьмисотвосьмидесятидевятимикрометровый}} (''{{lang|ru|Tysyachevos'misotvos'midesyatidevyatimikrometrovyy}}''), which is an adjective containing 46 letters, meaning "1889-micrometer".{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

== Sanskrit ==
Sanskrit allows [[Sanskrit compounds|word compounding]] of arbitrary length. Nouns and verbs can be expressed in a sentence.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} 

The longest sentence ever used in Sanskrit literature is (in [[Devanagari]]):

Each hyphen separates every individual word this word is composed of.

The approximate meaning of this word is:
:"In it, the distress, caused by thirst, to travellers, was alleviated by clusters of rays of the bright eyes of the girls; the rays that were shaming the currents of light, sweet and cold water charged with the strong fragrance of cardamom, clove, saffron, camphor and musk and flowing out of the pitchers (held in) the lotus-like hands of maidens (seated in) the beautiful water-sheds, made of the thick roots of vetiver mixed with marjoram, (and built near) the foot, covered with heaps of couch-like soft sand, of the clusters of newly sprouting mango trees, which constantly darkened the intermediate space of the quarters, and which looked all the more charming on account of the trickling drops of the floral juice, which thus caused the delusion of a row of thick rainy clouds, densely filled with abundant nectar."

== Slovak ==
Traditionally, the word ''{{lang|sk|najneobhospodarovávateľnejšieho}}'' (31 letters) is considered as the longest Slovak word, but there are some longer artificial words. Most of them are compound adjectives in dative, instrumental or other grammatical case and derived from the [[iterative aspect|iterative]] or [[frequentative]] verbal form or the ability adjective form (like -able).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jazykovaporadna.sme.sk/q/1973/|title=Aké je najdlhšie slovo v slovenčine?|work=sme.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.juls.savba.sk/ediela/ks/2012/4/ks2012-4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial words, lexically valid but never used in language:
* ''{{lang|sk|najnerozkrasokorčuľovateľnejšieho}}'',  33 letters
* ''{{lang|sk|znajneprekryštalizovávateľnejšievajúcimi}}'', 44 letters, "through the least crystallised ones"
* ''{{lang|sk|znajnepreinternacionalizovateľnejšievať}}'', 39 letters

== Spanish ==
{{Main article|Longest word in Spanish}}
The longest word in Spanish is "{{lang|es|esternocleidomastoideitis}}" (inflammation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, 30 letters).&lt;ref name="Calzado"&gt;{{cite book |title=Me la juego a letras |last=Roldán Calzado |first=Juan Luis |year= |chapter=La palabra más larga |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUHuAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34  |page=34 |publisher=Lulu Press |isbn=978-1-4092-2893-6 |language=Spanish |access-date=2017-03-15 |via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Runners-up are "{{lang|es|anticonstitucionalmente}}" ([proceeding in a manner that is] contrary to the constitution) and "{{lang|es|electroencefalografistas}}" (specialists that do electrical scans on brains (electroencephalographists)), both 23 letters.

The word "{{lang|es|anticonstitucionalmente}}" is usually considered the longest word ''in general use''. This word can be made even longer by the addition of the absolute superlative suffix, rendering "'''anticonstitucionalísimamente'''" (i.e.: "very strongly against the constitution"). Some dictionaries (but not the [[Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española|RAE dictionary]]&lt;ref&gt;http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=anticonstitucional&lt;/ref&gt;) removed its root word ("anticonstitucional") in 2005, causing comments about it not "being a valid word anymore" and suggesting the use of "inconstitucional" as a replacement.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

== Swedish ==
''{{lang|sv|Realisationsvinstbeskattning}}'' (28 letters) is the longest word in [[Svenska Akademiens Ordlista]]. It means "capital gains taxation", and is usually shortened to ''{{lang|sv|Reavinstskatt}}'' (same meaning).
However, Swedish grammar makes it possible to create arbitrarily long words. One such word is ''{{lang|sv|Spårvagnsaktiebolagsskensmutsskjutarefackföreningspersonalbeklädnadsmagasinsförrådsförvaltarens}}'' (94 letters) which means: "[belonging to] The manager of the depot for the supply of uniforms to the personnel of the track cleaners' union of the tramway company".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Guinness Book of Records 1985|publisher=Guinness Books|page=89|ISBN=0-85112-419-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tagalog ==
Tagalog—an [[agglutinative]] language—can make long words by adding on affixes, suffixes, and other root words with a connector. 

The longest published word in the language is “pinakanakakapagngitngitngitngitang-pagsisinungasinungalingan,” with 59 letters. This compound word means “to keep making up a lie that causes the most extreme anger while pretending you are not.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tagaloglang.com/pinakanakakapagngitngitngitngitang-pagsisinungasinungalingan/|title=Pinakanakakapagngitngitngitngitang-Pagsisinungasinungalingan|date=2015-12-30|work=TAGALOG LANG|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Turkish ==
{{Main article|Longest word in Turkish}}
Turkish, as an [[agglutinative]] language, carries the potential for words of arbitrary length.

''{{lang|tr|Muvaffakiyetsizleştiricileştiriveremeyebileceklerimizdenmişsinizcesine}}'', at 70 letters, has been cited as the longest [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word.  It was used in a contrived story designed to use this word.&lt;ref name="yenimesaj"&gt;[http://www.yenimesaj.com.tr/index.php?haberno=8001752&amp;tarih=2008-03-08 Yeni Mesaj, Turkish newspaper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718172642/http://www.yenimesaj.com.tr/index.php?haberno=8001752&amp;tarih=2008-03-08 |date=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="papatyam"&gt;[http://www.papatyam.org/index.php?topic=1833.0;wap Papatyam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727163116/http://www.papatyam.org/index.php?topic=1833.0;wap |date=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word means "As if you would be from those we can not easily/quickly make a maker of unsuccessful ones" and its usage was illustrated as follows: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''{{lang|tr|Kötü amaçların güdüldüğü bir öğretmen okulundayız. Yetiştirilen öğretmenlere öğrencileri nasıl}} '''{{lang|tr|muvaffakiyetsizleştir}}'''{{lang|tr|ecekleri öğretiliyor. Yani öğretmenler birer}} '''{{lang|tr|muvaffakiyetsizleştirici}}''' {{lang|tr|olarak yetiştiriliyorlar.

''We are in a teachers' training school that has evil purposes. The teachers who are being educated in that school are being taught how to '''make unsuccessful ones''' from students. So, one by one, teachers are being educated as '''makers of unsuccessful ones'''. However, one of those teachers refuses to be '''maker of unsuccessful ones''', in other words, to be '''made a maker of unsuccessful ones'''; he talks about and criticizes the school's stand on the issue. The headmaster who thinks every teacher '''can be made easily/quickly into a maker of unsuccessful ones''' gets angry. He invites the teacher to his room and says "You are talking '''as if you were one of those we can not easily/quickly turn into a maker of unsuccessful ones''', right?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other well-known very long Turkish words are: &lt;ref&gt;[http://nasil.yazilir.com/cekoslavakyalilastiramadiklarimizdan-misiniz/ "{{lang|tr|Çekoslavakyalılaştıramadıklarımızdan mısınız?"}}]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''{{lang|tr|Çekoslovakyalılaştıramadıklarımızdanmışsınızcasına}}'' means "As if you are one of those people whom we could not turn into a Czechoslovakian".
*''{{lang|tr|Afyonkarahisarlılaştırabildiklerimizdenmişsinizcesine}}'' means "As if you are one of the people that we made resemble from Afyonkarahisar". ([[Afyonkarahisar]] is a city in Turkey.)

== Vietnamese ==
[[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] is an [[isolating language]], which naturally limits the length of a [[morpheme]]. The longest, at seven letters, is {{wikt-lang|vi|nghiêng}}, which means "inclined" or "to lean".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Lộ" sai sót mới tại CK Đường lên đỉnh Olympia 2012?|author1=Phan Ngọc Linh|author2=Phạm Thịnh|work=Dân Trí|accessdate=18 October 2013|url=http://dantri.com.vn/su-kien/lo-sai-sot-moi-tai-ck-duong-len-dinh-olympia-2012-612416.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the longest word that can be written without a space. However, not all words in Vietnamese are single morphemes. Indeed, {{lang|vi|nghiêng}} can be [[Reduplication|reduplicate]]d as {{wikt-lang|vi|nghiêng nghiêng}}.

The written language abounds with compound words in which each constituent word is delimited by spaces, just like any freestanding word. Moreover, the grammar lacks inflection to mark parts of speech, and prepositions are often optional. Therefore, the boundary between a word and a phrase is poorly defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vietnam and the Colonial Condition of French Literature|first=Leslie|last=Barnes|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|date=2014|page=125|isbn=978-0-8032-66759|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-iqrBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT125|via=Google Books|quote=The formal characteristics of Vietnamese compounds are not completely clear, however, and because no obvious graphic boundaries exist to demarcate one word from another, the distinction between word and phrase is often very difficult to discern.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this ambiguity include:

* {{wikt-lang|vi|chủ nghĩa phân biệt chủng tộc|Chủ nghĩa phân biệt chủng tộc}} ("racism"), which is composed of the words {{wikt-lang|vi|chủ nghĩa}} ("ideology"), {{wikt-lang|vi|phân biệt}} ("discriminate"), and {{wikt-lang|vi|chủng tộc}} ("race")
* {{lang|vi|Cơm gà xào sả ớt}}, which literally describes a dish of grilled chicken sauteed with lemongrass and peppers on rice
* {{wikt-lang|vi|ông bà anh chị em|Ông bà anh chị em}}, a polite [[Vietnamese pronouns|pronoun]] composed of five kinship terms

Unlike locally coined compound words, compound words in [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]] are less ambiguous, because of the use of [[Grammatical modifier|premodifier]]s (as in English) as opposed to the native postmodifiers. Long Sino-Vietnamese words include {{wikt-lang|vi|bách khoa toàn thư}} ("encyclopedia") and {{wikt-lang|vi|thủy động lực học}} ("hydrodynamics").

Loanwords and [[pronunciation respelling]]s from other languages can also result in long words. For example, "consortium" is {{wikt-lang|vi|côngxoocxiom}} (12 letters), and "[[Indonesia]]" may be left as-is or spelled {{wikt-lang|vi|In-đô-nê-xi-a}} (13 counting hyphens).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thông tin cơ bản về các nước, khu vực và quan hệ với Việt Nam|trans-title=Basic information on countries, regions, and relations with Vietnam|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Vietnam)|Vietnam Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]|url=http://www.mofahcm.gov.vn/mofa/cn_vakv/|language=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Encyclopedic Dictionary of Vietnam]]'' systematically respells foreign names, introducing long names into an official Vietnamese lexicon:

* {{lang|vi|Kômixacjepxkaia}} ("[[Vera Komissarzhevskaya|Komissarzhevskaya]]", 15 letters)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=Kômixacjepxkaia V. F.|work=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Vietnam|year=2005|url=http://bachkhoatoanthu.vass.gov.vn/noidung/tudien/Lists/GiaiNghia/View_Detail.aspx?ItemID=12695|language=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|vi|Rôjơđextơvenxki}} ("[[Gennady Rozhdestvensky|Rozhdestvensky]]", 15 letters)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=Rôjơđextơvenxki G. N.|work=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Vietnam|year=2005|url=http://bachkhoatoanthu.vass.gov.vn/noidung/tudien/Lists/GiaiNghia/View_Detail.aspx?ItemID=23846|language=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|vi|Mêtơrôpôliten Ôpêra}} ("[[Metropolitan Opera]]", 18 letters)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=Mêtơrôpôliten Ôpêra|work=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Vietnam|year=2005|url=http://bachkhoatoanthu.vass.gov.vn/noidung/tudien/Lists/GiaiNghia/View_Detail.aspx?ItemID=16335|language=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long [[Acronym#Vietnamese|initialisms in Vietnamese]] include:

* {{wikt-lang|vi|CHXHCNVN}} ({{lang|vi|Cộng hòa Xã hội chủ nghĩa Việt Nam}}, "[[Vietnam|Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]", 8 characters)
* {{wikt-lang|vi|MTDTGPMNVN}} ({{lang|vi|Mặt trận Dân tộc Giải phóng miền Nam Việt Nam}}, "[[Viet Cong]]", 10 characters)

In modern Vietnamese, compound words can be identified fairly easily within [[title case]]d text: a morpheme that begins with a capital letter followed by one or more morphemes that begin with a lowercase letter. For example, {{wikt-lang|vi|xã hội chủ nghĩa}} ("socialism") is capitalized as one component within {{lang|vi|Cộng hòa Xã hội chủ nghĩa Việt Nam}}.

== Welsh ==
{{lang|cy|[[Llanfairpwllgwyngyll]]gogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch}}, a railway station on the island of [[Anglesey]] in Wales, is the longest place name in the [[Welsh language]]. At 51 letters in the [[Welsh alphabet]] (the digraphs ''ll'' and ''ch'' are each collated as single letters) the name can be translated as  "St Mary's church in the hollow of the white hazel near to the rapid whirlpool and the church of St Tysilio of the red cave". However, it was artificially contrived in the 1860s as a publicity stunt, to give the station the longest name of any railway station in the United Kingdom.

Long words are comparatively rare in Welsh. Candidates for long words other than proper nouns include the following (the digraph ''dd'' is also treated as a single letter, as is ''ng'' in many instances including in the last word below):

&lt;!--Replace these with longer words, if any exist--&gt;
* ''{{lang|cy|gwrthddatgysylltiadaeth}}'' (antidisestablishmentarianism)
* ''{{lang|cy|microgyfrifiaduron}}'' (microcomputers)
* ''{{lang|cy|tra-arglwyddiaethasant}}'' (they predominated)
* ''{{lang|cy|cyfrwngddarostynedigaeth}}'' (intercession)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0011&amp;L=welsh-l&amp;D=1&amp;O=A&amp;T=0&amp;P=739|title=LISTSERV 15.5 – WELSH-L Archives|work=heanet.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; (-''au'' can be added to form the plural)

'''Maningrida''', also known as '''Burarran''', is a small family of [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] spoken in northern Australia. It includes four languages, none closely related:
* [[Burarra language|Burarra]]
* [[Guragone language|Gurr-goni]]
* [[Djeebbana language|Ndjébbana]]
* [[Nakkara language|Na'kara]]

Green established the family by reconstructing the [[tense–aspect–mood]] inflections of Proto-Maningrida, and demonstrated common developments that set them apart from other [[Arnhem languages]].{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=369–424}}{{sfn|Koch|2004|p=44}}

A '''medical sign''' is an [[Objectivity (science)|objective]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition: 'Sign'|url=http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=81800|work=Stedman's Medical Dictionary|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins via Medilexicon International Ltd.'s website, medilexicon.org|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; indication of some medical fact or characteristic that may be detected by a patient or anyone, especially a [[physician]], before or during a [[physical examination]] of a [[patient]]. For example, whereas a tingling [[paresthesia]] is a [[symptom]] (only the person experiencing it can directly observe their own tingling feeling), [[erythema]] is a sign (anyone can confirm that the skin is redder than usual). Symptoms and signs are often [[sensitivity and specificity|nonspecific]], but often combinations of them are at least suggestive of certain [[diagnosis|diagnoses]], helping to narrow down what may be wrong. In other cases they are specific even to the point of being [[pathognomonic]].

Some signs may have no meaning to the patient, and may even go unnoticed, but may be meaningful and significant to the healthcare provider in assisting [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]].

Examples of signs include [[hypertension|elevated blood pressure]], a [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]] of the ends of fingers (which may be a sign of lung disease, or many other things), a staggering [[gait (human)]] and [[arcus senilis]] of the eyes.

The term ''sign'' is not to be confused with the term ''[[Indication (medicine)|indication]]'', which in medicine denotes a valid reason for using some treatment.

==Semiotics==
The art of interpreting clinical signs was originally called ''semiotics'' (a term now used for [[Semiotics|the study of sign communication in general]]) in English. This term, then written ''semeiotics'' (derived from the Greek adjective σημειωτικός: ''semeiotikos'', "to do with signs"), was first used in English in 1670 by [[Henry Stubbes]] (1631&amp;ndash;1676), to denote the branch of medical science relating to the interpretation of signs:

:...nor is there any thing to be relied upon in Physick, but an exact knowledge of medicinal phisiology (founded on observation, not principles), semeiotics, method of curing, and tried (not excogitated, not commanding) medicines....&lt;ref&gt;Stubbe, H. ([[Henry Stubbes]]), ''The Plus Ultra reduced to a Non Plus: Or, A Specimen of some Animadversions upon the Plus Ultra of Mr. Glanvill, wherein sundry Errors of some Virtuosi are discovered, the Credit of the Aristotelians in part Re-advanced; and Enquiries made...'' (London), 1670, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versus symptoms==
Signs are different from symptoms, the ''subjective'' experiences, such as [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], that patients might report to their examining physician.

For convenience, signs are commonly distinguished from symptoms as follows: Both are something abnormal, relevant to a potential medical condition, but a ''symptom'' is experienced and reported by the patient, while a ''sign'' is discovered by the physician during examination or by a clinical scientist by means of an [[in vivo]] examination of the patient.&lt;ref name="King 1982"&gt;{{Cite book |author=King, Lester S. |title=Medical Thinking: A Historical Preface |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |year=1982 |isbn=0-691-08297-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75}}

A slightly different definition views signs as any indication of a medical condition that can be objectively observed (i.e., by someone other than the patient), whereas a symptom is merely any manifestation of a condition that is apparent to the patient (i.e., something consciously affecting the patient).  From this definition, it can be said that an asymptomatic patient is uninhibited by disease.  However, a doctor may discover the sign hypertension in an asymptomatic patient, who does not experience "dis-ease", and the sign indicates a disease state that poses a hazard to the patient.  With this set of definitions, there is some overlap &amp;ndash; certain things may qualify as both a sign and a symptom (e.g., a bloody nose).

Lester S. King, author of ''Medical Thinking'', argues that an "essential feature" of a sign is that there is both a sign [or "signifier"] and a "thing signified". And, because "the essence of a sign is to convey information", it can only be a sign, properly speaking, if it has meaning. Therefore, "a sign ceases to be a sign when you cannot read it".&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{rp|73&amp;ndash;74}} A person, who has and exercises the knowledge required to understand the significance or indication or meaning of the sign, is necessary for something to be a complete sign. A physical phenomenon that is not actually interpreted as a sign pointing to something else is, in medicine, merely a symptom. Thus, King rejects "these present-day views [distinguishing signs from symptoms based on patient-subjective versus clinician-objective], however widely accepted, as quite faulty, at variance not only with ordinary usage but with the entire history of medicine."&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{rp|77}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[A] symptom is a phenomenon, caused by an illness and observable directly in experience. We may speak of it as a '''manifestation''' of illness. When the observer reflects on that phenomenon and uses it as a base for further inferences, then that symptom is transformed into a sign. As a sign it points beyond itself — perhaps to the present illness, or to the past or to the future. That to which a sign points is part of its meaning, which may be rich and complex, or scanty, or any gradation in between. In medicine, then, a sign is thus a phenomenon from which we may get a message, a message that tells us something about the patient or the disease. A phenomenon or observation that does not convey a message is not a sign. The distinction between signs and symptom rests on the meaning, and this is not perceived but inferred."&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{Rp|81}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Types==
Medical signs may be classified by the type of inference that may be made from their presence, for example:

* '''[[Prognostic]] signs''' (from ''progignṓskein'', προγιγνώσκειν, "to know beforehand"): signs that indicate the outcome of the current bodily state of the patient (i.e., rather than indicating the name of the disease).&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{rp|80}} Prognostic signs always point to the future. Perhaps the most famous prognostic sign is the [[facies Hippocratica]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[If the patient's facial] appearance may be described thus: the nose sharp, the eyes sunken, the temples fallen in, the ears cold and drawn in and their lobes distorted, the skin of the face hard, stretched and dry, and the colour of the face pale or dusky.… and if there is no improvement within [a prescribed period of time], it must be realized that this sign portends death."&lt;ref name="Chadwick 1978"&gt;{{cite book |author=Chadwick, J. &amp; Mann, W.N.(trans.) |title=Hippocratic writings |publisher=Penguin |location=Harmondsworth, UK |year=1978 |pages=170&amp;ndash;171 |isbn=0-14-044451-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* '''[[Medical history|Anamnestic]] signs''' (from ''anamnēstikós'', ἀναμνηστικός, "able to recall to mind"): signs that (taking into account the current state of a patient's body), indicate the past existence of a certain disease or condition.&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{rp|81}} Anamnestic signs always point to the ''past''. (As King (1982) explains, whenever we see a man walking with a particular gait, with one arm paralysed in a particular way, we say "This man has had a stroke"; and, if we see a woman in her late 50s with one arm distorted in a particular way, we say "She had polio as a child".&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{rp|81}})
* '''[[medical diagnosis|Diagnostic]] signs''' (from ''diagnōstikós'', διαγνωστικός, "able to distinguish"): signs that lead to the recognition and identification of a disease (i.e., they indicate the '''name''' of the disease).&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{rp|81}}
*"'[[List of eponymously named medical signs]]"': signs named after people.
* '''[[Pathognomonic]] signs''' (from ''pathognomonikós'', παθογνωμονικός, "skilled in diagnosis", derived from ''páthos'', πάθος, "suffering, disease", and ''gnṓmon'', γνώμον, "judge, indicator"): the particular signs whose presence means, beyond any doubt, that a particular disease is present.&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{rp|99&amp;ndash;100}} They represent a marked intensification of a diagnostic sign. (An example would be the palmar [[xanthoma]]ta seen on the hands of people suffering from [[hyperlipoproteinaemia]].) Singular pathognomonic signs are relatively uncommon.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Symptoms become signs when they permit inference. Ordinarily, one single symptom by itself—such as pain or swelling, or discoloration, or bloody discharge—would not permit any specific inference, but when symptoms occur in clusters and form a pattern, then the aggregate might point to a particular disease. The pathognomonic sign, however, does not need any other manifestation to lead the physician to the correct diagnosis. It constitutes a one-to-one relationship—the sign and the disease are uniquely related. The pathognomonic sign was the "clincher", the datum that established the diagnosis unequivocally."&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{Rp|100}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Technological development creating signs detectable only by physicians==
Prior to the nineteenth century there was little difference in the powers of observation between physician and patient. Most medical practice was conducted as a joint co-operative interaction between the physician and his aristocratic patient as equals; this was gradually replaced by a "monolithic consensus of opinion imposed from within the community of medical investigators".&lt;ref name="Jewson 1974"&gt;Jewson, N. D., "[http://soc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/8/3/369 Medical Knowledge and the Patronage System in 18th Century England]", ''Sociology'', Vol.8, No.3, (1974), pp. 369&amp;ndash;385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewson 1976"&gt;Jewson, N. D., "[http://soc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/10/2/225 The Disappearance of the Sick Man from Medical Cosmology, 1770&amp;ndash;1870]", ''Sociology'', Vol.10, No.2, (1976), pp. 225&amp;ndash;244.&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst each noticed much the same things, the physician had a more informed interpretation of those things: "the physicians knew what the findings meant and the layman did not".&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{rp|82}}

===Advances in the 19th century===
However, the patient was gradually removed from the medical interaction&lt;ref name="Jewson 1974" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewson 1976" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid3413276"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tsouyopoulos N |title=The mind-body problem in medicine (the crisis of medical anthropology and its historical preconditions) |journal=Hist Philos Life Sci |volume=10 Suppl |issue= |pages=55–74 |year=1988 |pmid=3413276 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to significant technological advances such as:

* The 1808 introduction of the [[percussion (medicine)|percussion]] technique, "the process through which "the physician can assess the state of the underlying lung by sensing the character of vibrations by gentle taps on the chest wall [something which] greatly facilitated the diagnosis of pneumonia and other respiratory diseases".&lt;ref name="Weatherall"&gt;{{cite book |author=Weatherall, D. |title=Science and the Quiet Art: The Role of Medical Research in Health Care |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |year= 1996|pages=46 |isbn=0-393-31564-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques, which had been first described by the Viennese physician [[Leopold Auenbrugger]] (1722&amp;ndash;1809) in 1761, became far more widely known following the publication of [[Jean-Nicolas Corvisart]]'s (French) translation of Auenbrugger's (Latin) work in 1808.
* The 1819 introduction by [[René Laennec]] (1781&amp;ndash;1826) of the technique of [[auscultation]] (using a [[stethoscope]] to listen to the circulatory and respiratory functions of the body). Laennec's publication was translated into English, 1821&amp;ndash;1834, by [[John Forbes (physician)|John Forbes]].
* The 1846 introduction by surgeon [[John Hutchinson (surgeon)|John Hutchinson]] (1811&amp;ndash;1861) of the [[spirometer]], an apparatus for assessing the mechanical properties of the lungs via measurements of forced exhalation and forced inhalation. (The recorded [[lung volumes]] and air flow rates are used to [[Spirometry|distinguish between]] restrictive disease (in which the lung volumes are decreased: e.g., [[cystic fibrosis]]) and obstructive diseases (in which the lung volume is normal but the air flow rate is impeded; e.g., [[emphysema]]).)
* The 1851 invention by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1821&amp;ndash;1894) of the [[ophthalmoscope]], which allowed physicians to examine the inside of the human eye.
* The (c.1870) immediate widespread clinical use of [[Clifford Allbutt|Sir Thomas Clifford Allbutt's]] (1836-1925) six inch (rather than twelve inch) pocket [[Medical thermometer|clinical thermometer]], which he had devised in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Allbutt, T.C., "Medical Thermometry", British and Foreign Medico-Chirurgical Review, [https://archive.org/stream/britishforeignme45londuoft#page/428/mode/2up Vol.45, No.90, (April 1870), pp.429-441]; [https://archive.org/stream/britishforeignme46londuoft#page/144/mode/2up Vo.46, No.91, (July 1870), pp.144-156.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1882 introduction of bacterian cultures by [[Robert Koch]], initially for the [[tuberculosis]], being the first laboratory test to confirm bacterial infections.
* The 1895 clinical use of [[X-ray]]s which began almost immediately after they had been discovered that year by [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen]] (1845&amp;ndash;1923).
* The 1896 introduction of the [[sphygmomanometer]], designed by [[Scipione Riva-Rocci]] (1863&amp;ndash;1937), to measure [[blood pressure]].

===Alteration of the relationship between physician and patient===
The introduction of the techniques of percussion and auscultation into medical practice altered the relationship between physician and patient in a very significant way, specifically because these techniques relied almost entirely upon the physician listening to the sounds of the patient's body.

Not only did this development greatly reduce the patient's capacity to observe and contribute to the process of diagnosis, it also meant that the patient was often instructed to stop talking, and remain silent.

As these sorts of evolutionary changes continued to take place in medical practice, it was increasingly necessary to uniquely identify data that was accessible only to the physician, and to be able to differentiate those observations from others that were also available to the patient, and it just seemed natural to use "signs" for the class of physician-specific data, and "symptoms" for the class of observations available to the patient.

King proposes a more advanced notion; namely, that a sign is something that has meaning, regardless of whether it is observed by the physician or reported by the patient:
{{quote|The belief that a symptom is a subjective report of the patient, while a sign is something that the physician elicits, is a 20th-century product that contravenes the usage of two thousand years of medicine. In practice, now as always, the physician makes his judgments from the information that he gathers. The modern usage of signs and symptoms emphasizes merely the source of the information, which is not really too important. Far more important is the use that the information serves. If the data, however derived, lead to some inferences and go beyond themselves, those data are signs. If, however, the data remain as mere observations without interpretation, they are symptoms, regardless of their source. Symptoms become signs when they lead to an interpretation. The distinction between information and inference underlies all medical thinking and should be preserved.&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{rp|89}}}}

==As tests==
In some senses, the process of diagnosis is always a matter of assessing the ''likelihood'' that a given condition is present in the patient. In a patient who presents with [[haemoptysis]] (coughing up blood), the haemoptysis is very much more likely to be caused by respiratory disease than by the patient having broken their toe. Each question in the history taking allows the medical practitioner to narrow down their view of the cause of the symptom, testing and building up their hypotheses as they go along.

Examination, which is essentially looking for clinical signs, allows the medical practitioner to see if there is evidence in the patient's body to support their hypotheses about the disease that might be present.

A patient who has given a good story to support a diagnosis of [[tuberculosis]] might be found, on examination, to show signs that lead the practitioner away from that diagnosis and more towards [[sarcoidosis]], for example. Examination for signs ''tests'' the practitioner's hypotheses, and each time a sign is found that supports a given diagnosis, that diagnosis becomes more likely.

Special tests (blood tests, [[radiology]], scans, a [[biopsy]], etc.) also allow a hypothesis to be tested. These special tests are also said to show signs in a clinical sense. Again, a test can be considered pathognonomic for a given disease, but in that case the test is generally said to be "diagnostic" of that disease rather than pathognonomic. An example would be a history of a fall from a height, followed by a lot of pain in the leg. The signs (a swollen, tender, distorted lower leg) are only very strongly suggestive of a fracture; it might not actually be broken, and even if it is, the particular kind of fracture and its degree of dislocation need to be known, so the practitioner orders an x-ray — and, for example, if the x-ray were to show a fractured [[tibia]], the film would be diagnostic of the fracture.

The '''point of sale''' ('''POS''') or '''point of purchase''' ('''POP''') is the time and place where a retail transaction is completed.  At the point of sale, the merchant calculates the amount owed by the customer, indicates that amount, may prepare an [[invoice]] for the customer (which may be a cash register printout), and indicates the options for the customer to make payment.  It is also the point at which a customer makes a payment to the merchant in exchange for goods or after provision of a service.  After receiving payment, the merchant may issue a [[receipt]] for the transaction, which is usually printed but is increasingly being dispensed with or sent electronically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paperless Receipt Solution (PRS) System|url=http://www.jamesdysonaward.org/projects/paperless-receipt-solution-prs-system/
 |publisher=James Dyson Foundation|accessdate=August 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Transmission of Prescriptions|url=https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pharmacies-gp-practices-and-appliance-contractors/prescribing-and-dispensing/electronic-prescription-service-eps

To calculate the amount owed by a customer, the merchant may use various devices such as [[weighing scale]]s, [[barcode]] scanners, and [[cash register]]s.  To make a payment, [[payment terminal]]s, touch screens, and other hardware and software options are available.

The point of sale is often referred to as the point of service because it is not just a point of sale but also a point of return or customer order.   POS terminal software may also include features for additional functionality, such as [[inventory management]], [[Customer relationship management|CRM]], financials, or [[warehouse|warehousing]].

Businesses are increasingly adopting POS systems, and one of the most obvious and compelling reasons is that a POS system does away with the need for [[price tag]]s.  Selling prices are linked to the [[Universal Product Code|product code]] of an item when adding stock, so the cashier merely needs to scan this code to process a sale.  If there is a price change, this can also be easily done through the inventory window. Other advantages include the ability to implement various types of discounts, a loyalty scheme for customers, and more efficient stock control.

==Terminology==
Retailers and marketers will often refer to the area around the checkout instead as the '''point of purchase''' ('''POP''') when they are discussing it from the retailer's perspective. This is particularly the case when planning and designing the area as well as when considering a marketing strategy and offers.

Some point of sale vendors refer to their POS system as "retail management system" which is actually a more appropriate term given that this software is no longer just about processing sales but comes with many other capabilities such as inventory management, membership system, supplier record, bookkeeping, issuing of purchase orders, quotations and stock transfers, hide barcode label creation, sale reporting and in some cases remote outlets networking or linkage, to name some major ones.

Nevertheless, it is the term ''POS system'' rather than ''retail management system'' that is in vogue among both end-users and vendors.

The basic, fundamental definition of a POS System, is a system which allows the processing and recording of transactions between a company and their consumers, at the time in which goods and/or services are purchased.

==History==

===Software before the 1990s===
[[File:McDonalds keyboard 6.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[McDonald's]] POS device by Brobeck]]

Early electronic [[cash register]]s (ECR) were controlled with proprietary software and were limited in function and communication capability. In August 1973, IBM released the IBM 3650 and 3660 store systems that were, in essence, a mainframe computer used as a store controller that could control up to 128 IBM 3653/3663 point of sale registers. This system was the first commercial use of client-server technology, [[peer-to-peer]] communications, [[local area network]] (LAN) simultaneous backup, and remote initialization. By mid-1974, it was installed in [[Pathmark]] stores in New Jersey and [[Dillard's]] department stores.

One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for [[McDonald's|McDonald's Restaurants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent

Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, [2] Vanilla Shake, [1] Large Fries, [3] BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item. By pressing the [Grill] button, a second or third order could be worked on while the first transaction was in progress. When the customer was ready to pay, the [Total] button would calculate the bill, including sales tax for almost any jurisdiction in the United States. This made it accurate for McDonald's and very convenient for the servers and provided the restaurant owner with a check on the amount that should be in the cash drawers. Up to eight devices were connected to one of two interconnected computers so that printed reports, prices, and taxes could be handled from any desired device by putting it into ''Manager Mode''. In addition to the error-correcting memory, accuracy was enhanced by having three copies of all important data with many numbers stored only as multiples of 3. Should one computer fail, the other could handle the entire store.

In 1986, Gene Mosher introduced the first graphical point of sale software&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Comdex_1986.png#globalusage  |title = Graphical point of sale software introducer}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a [[touchscreen]] interface under the ViewTouch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viewtouch.com/|title=ViewTouch|publisher=ViewTouch|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; trademark on the 16-bit [[Atari 520ST]] color computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gigi Bisson |url=http://www.viewtouch.com/AtariStart.html |title=Getting Down To Business |publisher=Viewtouch.com |date=2008-04-25 |accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured a color [[touchscreen]] widget-driven interface that allowed configuration of widgets representing menu items without low level programming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv2n6/gettingdowntobusiness.html The ViewTouch restaurant system] by Giselle Bisson&lt;/ref&gt; The ViewTouch point of sale software was first demonstrated in public at Fall Comdex, 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Comdex_1986.png |title=File:Comdex 1986.png&amp;nbsp;— Wikimedia Commons |publisher=Commons.wikimedia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Las Vegas Nevada to large crowds visiting the Atari Computer booth. This was the first commercially available POS system with a widget-driven color graphic touch screen interface and was installed in several restaurants in the USA and Canada.

In 1986, [[IBM]] introduced its [[IBM 4680|468x]] series of POS equipment based on [[Digital Research]]'s [[Concurrent DOS 286]] and [[FlexOS]] 1.xx, a modular real-time multi-tasking multi-user operating system.

===Modern software (post-1990s)===

A wide range of POS applications have been developed on platforms such as Windows and Unix. The availability of local processing power, local data storage, networking, and graphical user interface made it possible to develop flexible and highly functional POS systems. Cost of such systems has also declined, as all the components can now be purchased off-the-shelf.

In 1993, IBM adopted [[FlexOS 2.32]] as the basis of their [[IBM 4690 OS]] in their 469x series of POS terminals. This was developed up to 2014 when it was sold to [[Toshiba]], who continued to support it up to at least 2017.

As far as computers are concerned, off-the-shelf versions are usually newer and hence more powerful than proprietary POS terminals. Custom modifications are added as needed. Other products, like touchscreen tablets and laptops, are readily available in the market, and they are more portable than traditional POS terminals.  The only advantage of the latter is that they are typically built to withstand rough handling and spillages; a benefit for food &amp; beverage businesses.

The key requirements that must be met by modern POS systems include high and consistent operating speed, reliability, ease of use, remote supportability, low cost, and rich functionality. Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane.

Reliability depends not wholly on the developer but at times on the compatibility between a database and an OS version.  For example, the widely used [[Microsoft Access|MS Access]] database system had a compatibility issue when Windows XP machines were updated to a newer Windows OS. Microsoft immediately offered no solution. Some businesses were severely disrupted in the process, and many downgraded back to Windows XP for a quick resolution. Other companies utilized community support, for a registry tweak solution has been found for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/88542372-0fcb-4521-87ec-e2ab72e688dd/access-2007-very-slow-on-windows-7?forum=officesetupdeploylegacy|title=Access 2007 very slow on Windows 7|website=social.technet.microsoft.com|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

POS systems are one of the most complex software systems available because of the features that are required by different end-users. Many POS systems are software suites that include sale, inventory, stock counting, vendor ordering, customer loyalty and reporting modules.  Sometimes purchase ordering, stock transferring, quotation issuing, barcode creating, bookkeeping or even accounting capabilities are included.  Furthermore, each of these modules is interlinked if they are to serve their practical purpose and maximize their usability.

For instance, the sale window is immediately updated on a new member entry through the membership window because of this interlinking.  Similarly, when a sale transaction is made, any purchase by a member is on record for the membership window to report providing information like payment type, goods purchased, date of purchase and points accumulated. Comprehensive analysis performed by a POS machine may need to process several qualities about a single product, like selling price, balance, average cost, quantity sold, description and department.  Highly complex programming is involved (and possibly considerable computer resources) to generate such extensive analyses.

POS systems are designed not only to serve the retail, wholesale and hospitality industries as historically is the case.  Nowadays POS systems are also used in goods and property leasing businesses, equipment repair shops, healthcare management, ticketing offices such as cinemas and sports facilities and many other operations where capabilities such as the following are required: processing monetary transactions, allocation and scheduling of facilities, keeping record and scheduling services rendered to customers, tracking of goods and processes (repair or manufacture), invoicing and tracking of debts and outstanding payments.

Different customers have different expectations within each trade. The reporting functionality alone is subject to so many demands, especially from those in the retail/wholesale industry.  To cite special requirements, some business's goods may include perishables and hence the inventory system must be capable of prompting the admin and cashier on expiring or expired products.  Some retail businesses require the system to store credit for their customers, credit which can be used subsequently to pay for goods. A few companies even expect the POS system to behave like a full-fledged [[inventory management]] system, including the ability to provide even FIFO (First In First Out) and LIFO (Last In First Out), reports of their goods for [[accounting]] and tax purposes.

In the hospitality industry, POS system capabilities can also diverge significantly.  For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.

It may be said that a POS system can be made to serve different things to different end-users depending on their unique business processes. Quite often an off-the-shelf POS system is inadequate for customers; some customization is required, and this is why a POS system can become very complex. The complexity of a mature POS system even extends to remote networking or interlinking between remote outlets and the HQ such that updating both ways is possible. Some POS systems even offer the linking of web-based orders to their sale window.  Even when local networking is only required (as in the case of a high-traffic supermarket), there is the ever-present challenge for the developer to keep most if not all of their POS stations running. This puts high demand not just on software coding but also designing the whole system covering how individual stations and the network work together, and special consideration for the performance capability and usage of databases. Due to such complexity, bugs and errors encountered in POS systems are frequent.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

With regards to databases, POS systems are very demanding on their performance because of numerous submissions and retrievals of data - required for correct sequencing the receipt number, checking up on various discounts, membership, calculating subtotal, so forth - just to process a single sale transaction.  The immediacy required of the system on the sale window such as may be observed at a checkout counter in a supermarket also cannot be compromised. This places much stress on individual enterprise databases if there are just several tens of thousands of sale records in the database. Enterprise database Ms SQL, for example, has been known to freeze up (including the OS) entirely for many minutes under such conditions showing a "Timeout Expired" error message.   Even a lighter database like Ms Access will slow to a crawl over time if the problem of database bloating is not foreseen and managed by the system automatically. Therefore, the need to do extensive testing, [[debugging]] and improvisation of solutions to preempt failure of a database before commercialization further complicates the development.

POS system accuracy is demanding, given that monetary transactions are involved continuously not only via the sale window but also at the backend through the receiving and inputting of goods into the inventory. Calculations required are not always straightforward.  There may be many discounts and deals that are unique to specific products, and the POS machine must quickly process the differences and the effect on pricing. There is much complexity in the programming of such operations, especially when no error in calculation can be allowed.

Other requirements include that the system must have functionality for membership discount and points accumulation/usage, quantity and promotional discounts, mix and match offers, cash rounding up, invoice/delivery-order issuance with outstanding amount.  It should enable a user to adjust the inventory of each product based on physical count, track expiry of perishable goods, change pricing, provide audit trail when modification of inventory records is performed, be capable of multiple outlet functionality, control of stocks from HQ, doubling as an invoicing system, just to name some.

It is clear that POS system is a term that implies a wide range of capabilities depending on the end-user requirements. POS system review websites cannot be expected to cover most let alone all the features; in fact, unless one is a developer himself, it is unrealistic to expect the reviewer to know all the nuts and bolts of a POS system.  For instance, a POS system might work smoothly on a test database during the review but not when the database grows significantly in size over months of usage. And this is only one among many hidden critical functionality issues of a POS system.

===Hardware interface standardization (post-1980s)===
Vendors and retailers are working to standardize development of computerized POS systems and simplify interconnecting POS devices. Two such initiatives are [[OPOS]] and [[JavaPOS]], both of which conform to the [[UnifiedPOS]] standard led by [[National Retail Foundation|The National Retail Foundation]].

'''OPOS''' ([[Object linking and embedding|OLE]] for POS) was the first commonly adopted standard and was created by [[Microsoft]], [[NCR Corporation]], [[Epson]] and [[Fujitsu|Fujitsu-ICL]]. OPOS is a [[Component object model|COM]]-based interface compatible with all COM-enabled [[programming language]]s for [[Microsoft Windows]]. OPOS was first released in 1996. '''JavaPOS''' was developed by [[Sun Microsystems]], [[IBM]], and [[NCR Corporation]] in 1997 and first released in 1999. JavaPOS is for [[Java (programming language)|Java]] what OPOS is for Windows, and thus largely platform independent.

There are several communication ways POS systems use to control peripherals such as:
* Logic Controls \ BemaTech
* Epson Esc/POS
* UTC Standard
* UTC Enhanced
* AEDEX
* ICD 2002
* Ultimate
* CD 5220
* DSP-800
* ADM 787/788
* HP

There are also nearly as many proprietary protocols as there are companies making POS peripherals. Most POS peripherals, such as displays and printers, support several of these command protocols in order to work with many different brands of POS terminals and computers.

==User interface design==

The design of the sale window is the most important one for the user. This [[user interface]] is highly critical when compared to those in other software packages such as word editors or spreadsheet programs where the speed of navigation is not so crucial for business performance.

For businesses at prime locations where real estate comes at a premium, it can be common to see a queue of customers. The faster a sale is completed the shorter the queue and hence the more room available in a store for customers to shop around and employees to do their work.  High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.

Although improving the [[ergonomics]] is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.

==Cloud-based (post-2000s)==
The advent of [[cloud computing]] has given birth to the possibility of POS systems to be deployed as [[software as a service]], which can be accessed directly from the [[Internet]] using any [[internet browser]]. Using the previous advances in the communication protocols for POS's control of hardware, cloud-based POS systems are independent from platform and operating system limitations. Cloud-based POS systems are also created to be compatible with a wide range of POS hardware and sometimes tablets such as Apple's [[IPad]]. Thus cloud-based POS also helped expand POS systems to [[mobile device]]s, such as [[tablet computer]]s or [[smartphone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scandit.com/mobile-point-of-sale-apps-redefining-the-industry/ | title=Mobile Point-of-Sale Apps: Redefining the Retail Industry | publisher=Scandit | date=10 May 2013 | accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These devices can also act as [[Barcode reader#Smartphones|barcode reader]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s using a built-in camera and as [[payment terminal]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s using built-in [[Near field communication|NFC]] technology or an external payment card reader. A number of POS companies built their software specifically to be cloud-based. Other businesses who launched pre-2000s have since adapted their software to evolving technology.



Cloud-based POS systems are different from traditional POS largely because user data, including sales and inventory, are not stored locally, but in a remote server. The POS system is also not run locally, so there is no installation required.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.primaseller.com/blog/cloud-traditional-point-of-sale/ Cloud vs Traditional Point of Sale] via Primaseller&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bonfire"&gt;[http://smallbusinessbonfire.com/online-pos-system-revolution The Online POS System Revolution] via Small Business Bonfire&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the POS vendor and the terms of contract, compared to traditional on-premises POS installation, the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of lesser bugs and errors.

Other advantages of a cloud-based POS are instant centralization of data (important especially to chain stores), ability to access data from anywhere there is internet connection, and lower start-up costs.&lt;ref name="bonfire" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bluebird-global.com/epos-systems/cloud-based-point-sale-works/ | title=How Cloud-Based POS Works | publisher=Bluebird | accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloud based POS requires an internet connection. For this reason it important to use a device which has its own 3G capability in case the device's primary internet goes down. In addition to being significantly less expensive than traditional legacy point of sale systems, the real strength of a cloud based point of sale system is that there are developers all over the world creating software applications for cloud based POS.  Cloud based POS systems are often described{{By whom|date=April 2017}} as future proof as new applications are constantly being conceived and built.

A number of noted emerging cloud-based POS systems came on the scene less than a decade or even half a decade back. These systems are usually designed for restaurants, small and medium-sized retail operations with fairly simple sale processes as can be culled from POS system review sites.  It appears from such software reviews that enterprise-level cloud-based POS systems are currently lacking in the market. "Enterprise-level" here means that the inventory should be capable of handling a large number of records, such as required by grocery stores and supermarkets. It can also mean that the system--software and cloud server--must be capable of generating reports such as analytics of sale against inventory for both a single and multiple outlets that are interlinked for administration by the headquarters of the business operation.

POS vendors of such cloud based systems should also have a strong contingency plan for the breakdown of their remote server such as represented by failover server support.  However, sometimes even a major data center can fail completely, such as in a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/power-cooling/overheating-brings-down-microsoft-data-center/74543.fullarticle|title=Overheating brings down Microsoft data center|website=DatacenterDynamics|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On-premises installations are therefore sometimes seen alongside cloud-based implementation to preempt such incidents, especially for businesses with very high traffic. However the on-premises installations may not have the most up-to-date inventory and membership information.

For such contingency, a more innovative though highly complex approach for the developer is to have a trimmed down version of the POS system installed on the cashier computer at the outlet.  On a daily basis the latest inventory and membership information from the remote server is automatically updated into the local database.  Thus should the remote server fail, the cashier can switch over to the local sale window without disrupting sales.  When the remote server is restored and the cashier switches over to the cloud system, the locally processed sale records are then automatically submitted to the remote system, thus maintaining the integrity of the remote database.

Although cloud-based POS systems save the end-user startup cost and technical challenges in maintaining an otherwise on-premises installation, there is a risk that should the cloud-based vendor close down it may result in more immediate termination of services for the end-user compared to the case of a traditional full on-premises POS system where it can still run without the vendor.

Another consideration is that a cloud-based POS system actually exposes business data to service providers - the hosting service company and the POS vendor which have access to both the application and database.  The importance of securing critical business information such as supplier names, top selling items, customer relationship processes cannot be underestimated given that sometimes the few key success factors or trade secrets of a business are actually accessible through the POS system. This security and privacy concern is an ongoing issue in [[cloud computing]].

==Retail industry==
{{Main article|Retail}}
The retail industry is one of the predominant users of POS terminals.
[[File:Cashier stand in a Nigerian Grocery store.jpg|thumb|Points of sale at a Grocery store in [[Ilorin, Kwara]]]]
A retail point of sale system typically includes a [[cash register]] (which in recent times comprises a computer, monitor, cash drawer, [[receipt printer]], customer display and a barcode scanner) and the majority of retail POS systems&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibosocial.com/riteshmehta/pressrelease.aspx?prid=586672|title=The Point of Sale Application System for Retail Industries all Over the World|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; also include a debit/credit card reader. It can also include a [[conveyor belt]], weight scale, integrated credit card processing system, a signature capture device and a customer pin pad device. While the system may include a keyboard and mouse, more and more POS monitors use touch-screen technology for ease of use, and a computer is built into the monitor chassis for what is referred to as an all-in-one unit. All-in-one POS units liberate counter space for the retailer. The POS system software can typically handle a myriad of customer based functions such as sales, returns, exchanges, layaways, [[gift cards]], gift registries, customer loyalty programs, promotions, discounts and much more. POS software can also allow for functions such as pre-planned promotional sales, manufacturer coupon validation, foreign currency handling and multiple payment types.

The POS unit handles the sales to the consumer but it is only one part of the entire POS system used in a retail business. "Back-office" computers typically handle other functions of the POS system such as inventory control, purchasing, receiving and transferring of products to and from other locations. Other typical functions of a POS system are: store sales information for enabling customer returns, reporting purposes, sales trends and cost/price/profit analysis. Customer information may be stored for receivables management, marketing purposes and specific buying analysis. Many retail POS systems include an accounting interface that "feeds" sales and cost of goods information to independent accounting applications.

A multiple point of sale system used by big retailers like supermarkets and department stores has a far more demanding database and software architecture than that of a single station seen in small retail outlets. A supermarket with high traffic cannot afford a systemic failure, hence each point of sale station should not only be very robust both in terms of software, database and hardware specifications but also designed in such a way as to prevent causing a systemic failure - such as may happen through the use of a single central database for operations.

At the same time updating between multiple stations and the backend administrative computer should be capable of being efficiently performed, so that on one hand either at the start of the day or at any time each station will have the latest inventory to process all items for sale, while on the other hand at the end of the day the backend administrative computer can be updated in terms of all sale records.

This gets even more complicated when there is a membership system requiring real-time two-way updating of membership points between sale stations and the backend administrative computer.

Retail operations such as hardware stores (lumber yards), electronic stores and so-called multifaceted superstores need specialized additional features compared to other stores. POS software in these cases handles special orders, purchase orders, repair orders, service and rental programs as well as typical point of sale functions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.primaseller.com/best-pos-software/ POS Software Features] via Primaseller&lt;/ref&gt; Rugged hardware is required for point of sale systems used in outdoor environments. Wireless devices, battery powered devices, all-in-one units, and Internet-ready machines are typical in this industry.

Recently new applications have been introduced, enabling POS transactions to be conducted using mobile phones and tablets. According to a recent study, mobile POS (mPOS) terminals are expected to replace the contemporary payment techniques because of various features including mobility, upfront low cost investment and better user experience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://securebox.comodo.com/blog/pos-security/guidelines-choosing-securing-mobile-point-sale-system/ Securing Mobile Point of Sale System] via Securebox&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-2000s, the blind community in the United States engaged in structured negotiations to ensure that retail point of sale devices had tactile keypads.  Without keys that can be felt, a blind person cannot independently enter her or his PIN.  In the mid-2000s retailers began using "flat screen" or "signature capture" devices that eliminated tactile keypads.  Blind people were forced to share their confidential PIN with store clerks in order to use their debit and other PIN-based cards. The blind community reached agreement with Walmart, Target, CVS and eight other retailers that required real keys so blind people could use the devices.

===Physical configuration===

Early stores typically kept merchandise behind a counter. Staff would fetch items for customers to prevent the opportunity for theft and sales would be made at the same counter.  Self-service grocery stores such as [[Piggly Wiggly]], beginning in 1916, allowed customers to fetch their own items and pass the point of sale on the way to the exit.  Many stores have a number of cash registers for checkout, possibly now including [[self-checkout]].  This requires customers to guess which line will move the fastest, if they want to minimize their wait times; they are often frustrated to be wrong or be stuck behind another customer who encounters a problem or who takes a long time to check out.  Some stores use a single, much longer but faster-moving line, that is served by multiple registers, which produces the same average wait time, but reduces the frustration and variance in wait time from person to person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/07/22/425377064/planet-money-asks-what-small-thing-would-you-do-to-improve-the-world|title=Planet Money Asks: What Small Thing Would You Do To Improve The World?|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless of the configuration, checkout lines usually pass by [[impulse buy]] items to grab the attention of otherwise idle customers.

==Hospitality industry==
{{Main article|Hospitality industry}}
[[File:System recepcyjny HORECA13.jpg|thumb|Reception desk POS]]
[[File:Terminale POS HORECA13.jpg|thumb|Restaurant POS]]
[[File:Tablet POS HORECA13.jpg|thumb|Tablet-based POS]]
Hospitality point of sale systems are computerized systems incorporating registers, computers and peripheral equipment, usually on a computer network to be used in restaurants, hair salons or hotels. Like other point of sale systems, these systems keep track of sales, labor and payroll, and can generate records used in accounting and [[bookkeeping]]. They may be accessed remotely by restaurant corporate offices, troubleshooters and other authorized parties.

Point of sale systems have revolutionized the restaurant industry, particularly in the fast food sector. In the most recent technologies, registers are computers, sometimes with touch screens. The registers connect to a server, often referred to as a "store controller" or a "central control unit". Printers and monitors are also found on the network. Additionally, remote servers can connect to store networks and monitor sales and other store data.

Typical restaurant POS software is able to create and print guest checks, print orders to kitchens and bars for preparation, process [[credit card]]s and other payment cards, and run reports. In addition, some systems implement wireless pagers and electronic signature-capture devices.

In the [[fast food restaurant|fast food]] industry, displays may be at the front counter, or configured for drive-through or walk-through cashiering and order taking. Front counter registers allow taking and serving orders at the same terminal, while drive-through registers allow orders to be taken at one or more drive-through windows, to be cashiered and served at another. In addition to registers, drive-through and kitchen displays are used to view orders. Once orders appear they may be deleted or recalled by the touch interface or by bump bars. Drive-through systems are often enhanced by the use of drive-through wireless (or headset) intercoms. The efficiency of such systems has decreased service times and increased efficiency of orders.

Another innovation in technology for the restaurant industry is wireless POS. Many restaurants with high volume use wireless handheld POS to collect orders which are sent to a server. The server sends required information to the kitchen in real time. Wireless systems consist of drive-through microphones and speakers (often one speaker will serve both purposes), which are wired to a "base station" or "center module." This, in turn, will broadcast to headsets. Headsets may be an all-in-one headset or one connected to a belt pack.

In hotels, POS software allows for transfer of meal charges from dining room to guest room with a button or two. It may also need to be integrated with property management software.

Newer, more sophisticated systems are getting away from the central database "file server" type system and going to what is called a "cluster database". This eliminates any crashing or system downtime that can be associated with the back office file server. This technology allows 100% of the information to not only be stored, but also pulled from the local terminal, thus eliminating the need to rely on a separate server for the system to operate.

Tablet POS systems popular for retail solutions are now available for the restaurant industry.  Initially these systems were not sophisticated and many of the early systems did not support a remote printer in the kitchen.  Tablet systems today are being used in all types of restaurants including table service operations.  Most tablet systems upload all information to the Internet so managers and owners can view reports from anywhere with a password and Internet connection.  Smartphone Internet access has made alerts and reports from the POS very accessible.  Tablets have helped create the Mobile POS system, and Mobile POS applications also include payments, loyalty, online ordering, table side ordering by staff and table top ordering by customers. Regarding the payments, mobile POS can accept all kinds of payment methods from contactless cards, [[EMV]] chip-enabled cards, and mobile NFC enabled cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epossystemsguide.co.uk/mpos|title=mPOS {{!}}  Market-Inspector|website=www.epossystemsguide.co.uk|language=da-DK|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile POS (AKA mPOS) is growing quickly with new developers entering the market almost on a daily basis.

With the proliferation of low-priced touchscreen tablet computers, more and more restaurants have implemented self-ordering through tablet POS placed permanently on every table.  Customers can browse through the menu on the tablet and place their orders which are then sent to the kitchen. Most restaurants that have iPad self-order menus include photos of the dishes so guests can easily choose what they want to order. This apparently improves service and saves manpower on the part of the restaurant.  However this depends on how intelligently the system has been programmed to be.


As a case in point, some self-ordering systems not requiring staff assistance may not properly recognize a subsequent order from the same customer at a table.  As a result, the customer is left waiting and wondering why his second order of food and drink is not being served.

Another example of how intelligent the system can be, is whether an order that has been placed but not yet been processed by the kitchen can be modified by the customer through the tablet POS. For such an unprocessed order the customer should be given the option to easily retrieve his order and modify it on the tablet POS.  But when his order is being processed this function should then be automatically disabled.

Self-ordering systems are not always free completely from intervention by the staff and for some good reasons.  For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so.  This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered.  If alcoholic drinks are ordered, it also becomes necessary for the waiter to first verify the age of the customer before sending the order.

The technical specifications for implementing such self-ordering system are more demanding than a single cashier-controlled POS station.  On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed.  The common database that serves this network must also be capable of serving many concurrent users - cashier, customers, kitchen and perhaps even a drink bar.

It is therefore to be noted by developers that some databases like popularly used Ms Access may have the specifications that it is capable of usage by multiple concurrent users.  However under the stress of a POS system, they can fail miserably resulting in constant errors and corruption of data.

POS systems are often designed for a variety of clients, and can be programmed by the end users to suit their needs. Some large clients write their own specifications for vendors to implement. In some cases, POS systems are sold and supported by third-party distributors, while in other cases they are sold and supported directly by the vendor.

The selection of a restaurant POS system is critical to the restaurant's daily operation and is a major investment that the restaurant's management and staff must live with for many years. The restaurant POS system interfaces with all phases of the restaurant operation and with everyone that is involved with the restaurant including guests, suppliers, employees, managers and owners. The selection of a restaurant POS system is a complex process that should be undertaken by the restaurant owner and not delegated to an employee. The purchase process can be summarized into three steps: Design, Compare and Negotiate. The Design step requires research to determine which restaurant POS features are needed for the restaurant operation. With this information the restaurant owner or manager can Compare various restaurant POS solutions to determine which POS systems meet their requirements. The final step is to Negotiate the price, payment terms, included training, initial warranty and ongoing support costs.&lt;ref name="POS process 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.net/newsroom/pr/00077555-restaurant-pos.html|title=Restaurant POS 3-Step Purchase Process|publisher=[[Newswire]]|first=Bob|last=Frazier|date=October 16, 2013|accessdate=February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accounting forensics==
{{Main article|Automated sales suppression device}}
POS systems record sales for business and tax purposes. Illegal software dubbed "zappers" can be used on POS devices to falsify these records with a view to evading the payment of taxes.

In some countries, legislation is being introduced to make cash register systems more secure. For example, the French treasury is estimated to be failing to collect approximately €14 billion of VAT revenue each year. The Finance Bill of 2016 is intended to address some of this loss by making it compulsory for taxpayers to operate on “secure systems”. Therefore, from 1 January 2018, all retail businesses in France are required to record customer payments using certified secure accounting software or cash register systems. 

A certified cash register system must provide for the (i) inalterability, (ii) security and (iii) storage and archiving of data. All businesses required to comply must obtain a certificate from the cash register system provider which certifies that the system meets these requirements. This is because VAT taxpayers may need to provide a certificate to the tax authorities showing that their cash management system fulfils the new requirements.

If the business cannot provide this certificate to the tax authorities, they may be fined. And, if the tax authorities can demonstrate fraudulent use of the system, both the business and the software provider can face tax penalties, fines, and criminal sanctions. Certification can be obtained either from: a body accredited by the French Accreditation Committee (Comité français d’accréditation or COFRAC) or the software provider of the cash register system.

==Security==
Despite the more advanced technology of a POS system as compared to a simple cash register, the POS system is still as vulnerable to employee theft through the sale window. A dishonest cashier at a retail outlet can collude with a friend who pretends to be just another customer. During checkout, the cashier can bypass scanning certain items or enter a lower quantity for some items thus profiting thereby from the "free" goods.

The ability of a POS system to void a closed sale receipt for refund purpose without needing a password from an authorized superior also represents a security loophole. Even a function to issue a receipt with a negative amount which can be useful under certain circumstances, can be exploited by a cashier to easily lift money from the cash drawer.

In order to prevent such employee theft, it is crucial for a POS system to provide an admin window for the boss or administrator to generate and inspect a daily list of sale receipts, especially pertaining to the frequency of cancelled receipts before completion, refunded receipts and negative receipts. This is one effective way to alert the company to any suspicious activity - such as a high number of cancelled sales by a certain cashier - that may be going on and to take monitoring action.

To further deter employee theft, the sale counter should also be equipped with a [[closed-circuit television]] camera pointed at the POS system to monitor and record all the activities.

At the backend, price and other changes like discounts to inventory items through the administration module should also be secured with passwords provided only to trusted administrators. Any changes made should also be logged and capable of being subsequently retrieved for inspection.

The sale records and inventory are highly important to the business because they provide very useful information to the company in terms of customer preferences, customer membership particulars, what are the top selling products, who are the vendors and what margins the company is getting from them, the company monthly total revenue and cost, just to name some.

It is therefore important that reports on these matters generated at the administrative backend be restricted only to trusted personnel.  The database from which these reports are generated should also be secured via passwords or via encryption of data stored in the database so as to prevent them from being copied or tampered with.

Despite all such precautions and more, the POS system can never be entirely watertight in security from internal misuse if a clever but dishonest employee knows how to exploit many of its otherwise useful capabilities.

News reports on POS system hacking show that hackers are more interested in stealing credit card information than anything else.  The ease and advantage offered by the ability of a POS system to integrate credit card processing thus have a downside. In 2011,  hackers were able to steal credit card data from 80,000 customers because Subway's security and POS configuration standards for PCI Compliance - which governs credit card and debit card payment systems security - were "directly and blatantly disregarded"  by Subway franchisees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2011/12/how-hackers-gave-subway-a-30-million-lesson-in-point-of-sale-security/|title=How hackers gave Subway a $3 million lesson in point-of-sale security|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, several hundred of Wendy's fast food restaurants had their POS systems hacked by an illegally installed malware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/wendys-point-of-sale-hack-grows/|title=Wendy's Point of Sale Hack Grows Bigger|first=Tara|last=Seals|date=13 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report goes on to say that "the number of franchise restaurants impacted by these cybersecurity attacks is now expected to be considerably higher than the 300 restaurants already implicated" and that the "hackers made hundreds of thousands of fraudulent purchases on credit and debit cards issued by various financial institutions after breaching Wendy's computer systems late last year".

Again, these exploits by hackers could only be made possible because payment cards were processed through the POS system allowing the malware to either intercept card data during processing or steal and transmit unencrypted card data that is stored in the system database.

In April 2017, security researchers identified critical vulnerabilities in point of sale systems developed by SAP and Oracle &lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |title=SAP point-of-sale systems were totally hackable with $25 kit |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/06/15/sap_patch_batch_fixes_3_yr_old_vuln/ |newspaper=The Register|date=29 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and commented, “POS systems are plagued by vulnerabilities, and incidents occurred because their security drawbacks came under the spotlight.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://erpscan.com/research/hacking-sap-pos/|title=How to buy MacBook for $1, or hacking SAP POS - SAP Cyber Security Solutions|website=erpscan.com|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SAP POS Flaw Allows Hackers to Change Pricing |url=https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/sap-pos-flaw-hackers-change-pricing/|newspaper=Info Security|date=25 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If successfully exploited, these vulnerabilities provide a perpetrator with access to every legitimate function of the system, such as changing prices, and remotely starting and stoping terminals. To illustrate the attack vector, the researchers used the example of hacking POS to change the price of a MacBook to $1. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP1xHUBnAEs&amp;feature=youtu.be/|title=How to buy a MacBook for $1, or hacking SAP POS|first=|last=ERPScan inc|date=24 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The security issues were reported to the vendor, and a patch was released soon after the notification. Oracle confirmed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/security-bug-affects-over-300-000-oracle-pos-systems/|title=Security Bug Affects Over 300,000 Oracle POS Systems

}}&lt;/ref&gt; security bug affects over 300,000 Oracle POS Systems

In some countries, credit and debit cards are only processed via [[payment terminal]]s.  Thus one may see quite a number of such terminals for different cards cluttering up a sale counter.  This inconvenience is however offset by the fact that credit and [[debit card]] data is far less vulnerable to hackers, unlike when payment cards are processed through the POS system where security is contingent upon the actions taken by end-users and developers.

With the launch of [[mobile payment]] particularly [[Android Pay]] and [[Apple Pay]] both in 2015, it is expected that because of its greater convenience coupled with good security features, this would eventually eclipse other types of payment services - including the use of payment terminals.  However, for mobile payment to go fully mainstream, mobile devices like smartphones that are [[Near Field Communication|NFC-enabled]] must first become universal. This would be a matter of several years from the time of this writing (2017) as more and more models of new smartphones are expected to become NFC-enabled for such a purpose. For instance, iPhone 6 is fully NFC-enabled for mobile payment while iPhone 5 and older models are not.  The aforesaid disastrous security risks connected with processing payment card usage through a POS system would then be greatly diminished.

{{Expand German|Questione Ladina|date=May 2016}}
The '''Questione Ladina''' asks whether the [[Romance languages|Romance languages or dialects]] spoken in the [[Alps]], namely [[Romansh language|Romansh]], [[Ladin language|Ladin]] and [[Friulian language|Friulian]], form a proper [[language family|language subfamily]] or should rather be regarded as a part of a wider [[Northern Italian languages|Northern Italian]] [[dialect continuum]].

== History ==
[[File:Rhaeto-Romance languages.png|250px|thumbnail|The Rhaeto-Romance languages]]
The beginning of the Questione Ladina is marked by the publication of the ''Saggi ladini'' by [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]] (1829–1907), who identified the area between the [[Oberalp Pass]] and the [[Gulf of Trieste]] as a specific language area, with some common characteristics, and called the idioms spoken there ''Ladin dialects''. The theory gained a large circulation with the publications of the Austrian linguist [[Theodor Gartner]], who, however, used ''[[Rhaeto-Romance languages|Rhaeto-Romance]]'' instead of ''Ladin'' as an umbrella term.&lt;ref&gt;Ricarda Liver (1999), ''Rätoromanisch – Eine Einführung in das Bündnerromanische'', Tübingen: Gunter Narr, {{ISBN|3-8233-4973-2}}, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a Ladin unity was strongly opposed by [[Carlo Battisti]] (1882–1977), who demonstrated, in several studies, that the whole range of dialects in question showed only a few common characteristics and was just as closely related to neighbouring [[Lombard language|Lombard]] and [[Venetian language|Venetian varieties]]. The dialectologist [[Carlo Salvioni]] held similar views.&lt;ref&gt;Ricarda Liver (1999), ''Rätoromanisch – Eine Einführung in das Bündnerromanische'', Tübingen: Gunter Narr, {{ISBN|3-8233-4973-2}}, p. 16−17&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the idea of a distinctive language sub-family and the denial of a Ladin unity still have strong proponents, the former especially among Swiss, German and Austrian, the latter among Italian linguists.&lt;ref&gt;
Ricarda Liver (1999), ''Rätoromanisch – Eine Einführung in das Bündnerromanische'', Tübingen: Gunter Narr, {{ISBN|3-8233-4973-2}}, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; A third position has been taken by other linguists (e.g. Heinrich Schmid, Andreas Schorta, Pierre Bec, Geoffrey Hull), who agree with the Italianists that the Rhaeto-Romance dialects are archaic variants of the adjacent vernaculars of Lombardy, Trentino and Venetia, but differ from them in considering the entire Rhaeto-Cisalpine or 'Padanian' linguistic unity to be an integral unit of Gallo-Romance and structurally not Italo-Romance, in spite of superficial Italian influences in certain areas (Liguria, the Veneto and Istria primarily, but also in Friuli and parts of Lombardy).&lt;ref&gt; For a description of the Rhaeto-Cisalpine system and a discussion of classifications, see especially Geoffrey Hull, ''The Linguistic Unity of Northern Italy and Rhaetia: Historical Grammar of the Padanian Language'', 2 vols. Sydney: Beta Crucis, 2017. {{ISBN|978-1-64007-053-0}}, {{ISBN|978-1-54987-998-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aspects ==
A characteristic is the commixture of grammatical and sociolinguistic aspects, as well as of linguistic and political-ideological convictions. Battisti and Salvioni's research was influenced by sympathies for the [[Italian irredentism]], leading to the demand that speakers of Romansh should accept Italian as a ''[[Dachsprache]]'' because of their ''Italianity'', and subsequently to linguistically justified political claims that the Romansh-speaking [[Graubünden]] should become part of Italy.&lt;ref name="Liver17"&gt;Ricarda Liver (1999), ''Rätoromanisch – Eine Einführung in das Bündnerromanische'', Tübingen: Gunter Narr, {{ISBN|3-8233-4973-2}}, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Swiss linguists regarded mere grammatical features as subordinated to sociolinguistic and historic considerations, and they strongly supported the idea of a separate "language".&lt;ref name="Liver17"/&gt;

{{Esperanto sidebar |expanded=Criticism}}
'''Reformed Esperanto''', or '''Esperanto 1894''', is an [[Esperantido]], a [[constructed language]] derived from [[Esperanto]]. It is notable as the only complete Esperantido created by the original creator of Esperanto, [[L. L. Zamenhof]]. Although Zamenhof's stated preference was to avoid any discussion of changes, he was put under considerable pressure, including financial, to respond to the diverse reforms proposed by others. Reluctantly he decided to present a reformed dialect himself and undertook to continue guiding the community, whether or not reforms were eventually agreed upon.

Although Zamenhof initially called his reform a systematic attempt to re-create the language in the light of more than six years of practical experience, scarcely any of the [[Esperanto community]] of the time accepted it as a whole. The majority voted to reject all changes. Zamenhof himself later rejected the whole project and referred to 1894 as 'a wasted year'. In 1907 he expressly refused permission to anyone wishing to re-publish the proposed reforms. In 1929 Johannes Dietterle cited this refusal as justification for omitting details of the reform project from his collection of Zamenhof's complete works, ''Originala Verkaro''.

Some of the proposed reforms from 1894 such as replacing the '''-oj''' plural with '''-i''', the removal of the [[diacritic]]s and adjectival agreement were used in the language reform project [[Ido (language)|Ido]] beginning in 1907, but these were not accepted by the Esperanto community either and Esperanto has changed relatively little since the publication of Zamenhof's ''[[Fundamento de Esperanto]]'' in 1905.

== Main proposed changes ==

# The accented letters would disappear, together with most of their sounds.
# The "c" would be pronounced like the old "ŝ"; "z" as the old "c", i.e. as {{IPA|/ts/}}.
# The letters "ĝ" and "ĵ" would be usually replaced by "g" and "j" respectively. 
# The definite article would be eliminated.
# The accusative would have the same form as the nominative and depend on position for clarity.
# A plural noun would replace "-o" with "-i", instead of adding "-j".
# Both adjectives and adverbs would take the ending "-e", be invariable, and depend on position for clarity.
# The number of participles would be reduced from six to two.
# The table of correlatives would be replaced with words or phrases taken from Romance languages.
# The roots of the language would be changed to reflect the new alphabet.
# The roots of the language not taken from Latin or Romance languages would be replaced by such.

'''Resistance''', in the context of the field of [[psychoanalysis]], refers to oppositional behavior when an individual's unconscious defenses of the [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] are threatened by an external source. [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of psychoanalytic theory, developed his concept of resistance as he worked with patients who suddenly developed uncooperative behaviors during sessions of [[talk therapy]]. He reasoned that an individual that is suffering from a psychological affliction, which Sigmund Freud believed to be derived from the presence of suppressed illicit or unwanted thoughts, may inadvertently attempt to impede any attempt to confront a subconsciously perceived threat. This would be for the purpose of inhibiting the revelation of any repressed information from within the [[unconscious mind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality Psychology: Domains of Knowledge About Human Nature|last=Larsen|first=Randy; Buss, David|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-110168-4|location=|pages=696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Having developed the theory of resistance through his direct experiences with patients undergoing therapy, Sigmund Freud noticed that patients would avoid subjects and topics that struck too closely to uncomfortable memories or unacceptable emotions and desires. Freud then integrated these findings with his previous theories concerning the functions of the [[id, ego and super-ego]]. As a result, he eventually advanced his concept of resistance by developing it into a multitude of individual forms that included repression, transference, ego-resistance, "working-through", and self-sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freudfile.org/psychoanalysis/resistance.html|title=Psychoanalysis - Resistances|website=www.freudfile.org|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common theory behind many of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic techniques, alluding to the fundamentals of psychoanalysis as a science, was that it is possible that memories that have been lost from consciousness provide hints of their existence by the means of prompting certain thoughts and behaviors.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ikonen|first=Pentti|last2=Absetz|first2=Kimmo|date=2002|title=The basic tools of psychoanalysis|url=|journal=The Scandinavian Psychoanalytic Review|volume=25|issue=1|pages=12–19|doi=10.1080/01062301.2002.10592721|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the aim of psychoanalysis is to bring what is unconscious or [[preconscious]] into consciousness through verbalization. Afterwards, the act of bringing such thoughts into consciousness prevents them from motivating behavior and thus allowing the individual to exert more personal control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bernstein|first1=June|title=Consciousness and interpretation in modern psychoanalysis|journal=Modern Psychoanalysis|date=2009|volume=34|issue=1|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its history, resistance has caused significant division between psychologists. It remains a debated issue as there are some who considered it to be merely a description of a patient’s temperament rather than a universal construct of the human mind. Nonetheless, the concept of resistance retains a firm place in the history of psychology and the development of modern [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Motivational Interviewing: Preparing People for Change, 2nd Edition|last=Miller, William R.|first=Stephen, Rollnick|publisher=Guilford Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1572305632|location=New York City|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms of resistance ==

=== Repression ===
{{main article|Psychological repression}}

[[Psychological repression|Repression]] is the form of resistance where the ego pushes offensive memories, ideas, and impulses down into the unconscious. Essentially, the patient is unconsciously hiding memories from the conscious mind.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolman|first1=Benjamin|title=The Unconscious Mind: The Meaning of Freudian Psychology|date=1968|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-13-935767-1|page=182|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transference ===
{{main article|Transference}}

Typically unconscious, [[transference]] is when the patient allows past experiences to affect present relationships. In therapy, this may come about if the therapist reminds the patient, either consciously or unconsciously, of someone in their past who may have had an early impact on their life. Subsequently, the patient may suddenly tend to regard the therapist in either a positive or negative manner, depending upon the nature of the past influence.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=edited by Glen O. Gabbard, Bonnie E. Litowitz, Paul|title=Textbook of psychoanalysis|date=2012|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub.|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9781585629794|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ego-resistance ===
This form of resistance is a neurotic regression to a proposed state of childlike safety. Usually, it involves the patient's attempts to gain attention and sympathy by emphasizing minor medical symptoms (i.e. headaches, nausea, and depression).&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=1926|isbn=978-0393008746|location=New York City|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working-through ===
{{main article|Working through}}
Derived from the id,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; this form of resistance reflects the unconscious desire for consistency in a manner that is based upon the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]]. Since the id is an innate portion of human instinct, interpretation of the conscious is an insufficient method, thus the psychoanalyst must first be able to surmount resistances by the means of deduction of patients' unconscious defenses that are presented through exploitation of the mechanism of transference.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Self-sabotage ===
The weakest form of resistance that reflects the moralistic sentiments of the superego.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Essentially, it is a manifestation of internal guilt that prompts personal punishment by the means of self-imposed impediment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Applications ==
[[Psychoanalysis]] is, altogether, considered to be a type of insight-oriented therapeutic program. Despite general initial reservations, these types of programs have since transitioned from being quite marginal to becoming more well-known and mainstream.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrington|first=Anne|last2=Dunne|first2=John|date=2015|title=When mindfulness is therapy: ethical qualms, historical perspectives|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/25757884/97605608.pdf?sequence=1|journal=American Psychologist|volume=70|issue=7|pages=621–631|doi=10.1037/a0039460|pmid=26436312|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In consideration to the theory of resistance itself, within a clinical setting, the expression of resistance is considered to be a significant stage to recovery because it reveals the presence of [[Psychological repression|repression]]. Additionally, it is indicative of progress in the effort of resolving any underlying issues that may be the cause of personal dysfunction. As resistance is theorized to be a manifestation of  the unconscious mind's attempts to protect the [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]], it is the task of the psychoanalyst to combat this opposition by directing the patient to confront the unacceptable desires or uncomfortable memories. By this course of action, the patient may reach a [[Catharsis|cathartic]] conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality Psychology: Domains of Knowledge About Human Nature|last=Larsen|first=Randy; Buss, David|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-110168-4|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
{{See also|Psychoanalysis#Criticism|Psychotherapy#General critiques}}
Psychologists remain divided with regard to the concept of resistance. Since Freud first developed his theory of resistance, he has been significantly criticized for using personally favorable and [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable methodology]]. For example, if a patient were to agree with a psychoanalyst's inference about themselves, it is a confirmation that there is something they are repressing. However, if the patient disagrees, it is also a sign they are engaged in repression, which means the psychoanalyst is correct in either scenario.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holowchak|first=Andrew|date=2012|title=The problem of unassailability: analogy and adequacy of constructions in freudian psychoanalysis|url=|journal=Psychoanalytic Psychology|volume=29|issue=2|pages=255–266|doi=10.1037/a0020863|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many psychologists believe that the success of psychoanalysis is not due its various explanatory systems or its reasoning for repression, but rather simply due to the process of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud (Psychopathology of Everyday Life, the Interpretation of Dreams, and Three Contributions To the Theory of Sex)|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|publisher=Modern Library|year=1938|isbn=978-0679601661|location=New York City|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:San Pellegrino University Foundation.jpg|thumbnail|San Pellegrino University Foundation]]

The '''San Pellegrino University Foundation''' (also referred to as FUSP or San Pellegrino) was established in 2010. It owes its academic heritage to the [[Servite Order]] which in 1973 founded the ''Liceo Linguistico San Pellegrino''&lt;ref name=Liceo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liceo|first1=FUSP|title=40 anni per il liceo linguistico San Pellegrino|url=http://www.riminitoday.it/cronaca/misano-40-anni-per-il-liceo-linguistico-san-pellegrino-sabato-una-grande-festa.html|website=www.riminitoday.it|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the San Pellegrino High School specialising in foreign languages) and in 1987 founded the ''Scuola Superiore per Interpreti e Traduttori'' (School for Translators and Interpreters).

Founding members of FUSP are the Order of the Servants of Mary, the Municipality of [[Misano Adriatico]] and the Nida Institute for Biblical Scholarship of [[New York City|New York]]. New partners include the [[:it:Gruppo Maggioli|Gruppo Maggioli]] (since 2014) and Uniformazione Vicenza (since 2013).

== Academics ==

FUSP offers an undergraduate program in Cultural Mediation at the Scuola Superiore per Mediatori Linguistici (SSML) in Misano Adriatico.

The degree program operates on a semester academic calendar with Fall semester running from October to December and Spring semester running from mid-February to early-May. The program focuses on perfecting one’s language skills through the acquisition of translation and interpreting skills. All alumni must take English as their first language and can then add up to two languages to their curriculum, choosing from [[Russian language|Russian]],&lt;ref name=Russo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russian Certifications|title=Il russo fra le lingue più studiate a Misano|url=http://www.newsrimini.it/2015/01/il-russo-tra-le-lingue-piu-apprezzate-da-studenti-san-pellegrino/|website=www.newsrimini.it|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]],  [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Brazilian Portuguese]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Core modules also include General Linguistics, Italian Linguistics, Translation Theory, Elements of Economics, Geography and Law. There is an entry level writing test in [[English language|English]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] prior to enrolment (end of September). Exam sessions take place in January, May–June and September–October.

Since 1987, SSML has actively participated in the [[Erasmus Programme]], the EU student exchange programme which enables students attending SSML to study abroad at its partner universities and/or work for partner companies in the [[European Union]] whilst receiving a bursary.

In 2014, FUSP inaugurated a separate branch of SSML located in the South of Italy, in [[Fasano]] (Brindisi), and in 2013 the SSML of [[Vicenza]] in the North also joined the Foundation, thus consolidating the Foundation’s presence across Italy.

== Professional programs and advanced training ==

In 2010, FUSP opened Traduzione Editoria, its Translation and Publishing Department which organises professional courses and advanced training for editorial translators. Its most popular programs are:

*''Master di Tradurre la Letteratura'' (the "Translating Literature" Advanced Training course): this advanced training program has been running for 20 years (so prior to the establishment of the Foundation) and in 2015 it will celebrate its 20th edition. This course is composed of two parallel activities: translation workshops and seminars given by professional translators and key figures of the publishing industry. The seminars focus on specific topics which range from literature for young adults to graphic novels, romance novels to historical fiction.
*''Avviamento all’interpretazione simultanea e consecutiva'' (Introduction to Simultaneous and Consecutive Interpreting), a course for aspiring interpreters wishing to learn the techniques of the trade or interpreters who wish to consolidate the skills they have already acquired.
*''Master traduzione editoriale–letteraria dall’arabo'' (Advanced training course in literary-editorial translation from Arabic into Italian)

== Research ==

Research has always been a pivotal activity at San Pellegrino and FUSP is currently conducting extensive research in the field of translation and is specifically involved in these projects:

*The Nida School of Translation Studies (NSTS)&lt;ref name=NSTS&gt;{{cite web|last1=NSTS|title=La Fondazione San Pellegrino "succursale" di New York|url=http://www.romagnagazzette.com/2013/02/16/misano-adriatico-la-fondazione-san-pellegrino-succursale-di-new-york/|website=www.romagnagazette.com|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a two-week event which takes place in Misano in May every year. Now in its ninth edition, this important research gathering provides post-doctoral scholars, along with a limited number of advanced doctoral students, with an intense program of lectures, workshops, readings and tutorials, bringing together experts from around the world to critically explore various aspects of translation theory, linguistics, semiotics and cultural studies.
*PETRA (Platforme Européenne pour la traduction littéraire) – FUSP is one of the Project Partners of a European-Union funded research project (2014-2016) for the creation of a European platform for translation. The aims of the project are to create open structures, at national and European level, to enable universities and higher education establishments to collaborate with non-academic organizations and associations and networks of professional literary translators without cumbersome administrative procedures, and to start a discussion on promising, long-term structures for the education and training of literary translators at a European level. This involves exchange and cooperation between academic and non-academic institutions on the contents of training, on practical issues and methods of teaching.
The fellow PETRA Project Partners are: [[Utrecht University|Universiteit Utrecht]] (UU) – Faculty of Humanities, [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] (KU LEUVEN) – Faculty of Arts, [[Dutch Language Union|Nederlandse Taalunie]] /The Dutch Language Union (NTU), [[Eötvös Loránd University]] (ELTE) – Department of Dutch Studies, British Centre for Literary Translation (BCLT) – [[University of East Anglia]] (UEA), [[:de:Deutscher Übersetzerfonds|Deutscher Übersetzerfonds]] (DÜF), Conseil Européen des Associations de Traducteurs Littéraires (CEATL).
*"Translation: an interdisciplinary journal" is an international peer-reviewed journal, which from January 2012 is published twice a year in print and online versions. The journal takes as its main mission the collection and representation of the ways in which translation as a fundamental element of culture transforms our contemporary world. Its ambition is to create a forum for the discussion of translation, offering an open space for debate and reflection on what is referred to as [[post-translation studies]], moving beyond disciplinary boundaries towards wider transdisciplinary discourses on the translational nature of societies which are increasingly hybrid, diasporic, border-crossing, intercultural, multilingual, and global.
*FUSP is also the venue for the Nida School of Biblical Translation (NSBT) which brings together biblical translators from all over the world in May every year.

== Additional Activities ==

Every year the Foundation organises important competitions and events which attract interest on a local, regional and national level:

*''Premio Fondazione San Pellegrino per la Traduzione'' (Translation Competition for High School students):&lt;ref name="Premio Fondazione"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Premio Fondazione|first1=San Pellegrino|title=Premio Fondazione San Pellegrino per la traduzione raddoppia i partecipanti|url=http://www.altarimini.it/News56040-premio-fondazione-san-pellegrino-per-la-traduzione-raddoppiati-i-partecipanti.php|website=www.altarimini.it|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; this annual competition has been taking place since 2012. It is open to all 5th year students from public or private high schools in the provinces of [[Rimini]] (RN), [[Pesaro]] (PU), [[Ravenna]] (RA) and [[Province of Forlì-Cesena|Forlì-Cesena]] (FC) and involves translating a text from English, French, Spanish or German into Italian. The competition takes place in April every year; the best translators and runners up receive prizes at the award ceremony in May.
*''Premio San Pellegrino "Looking for Talent"'' ("Looking for Talent" Language Competition for Middle School Students): this annual competition, which has been taking place since 2013, tests the English language skills of 3rd year middle school students (12-13 year olds). Pupils from public or private middle schools in the provinces of Rimini (RN) and Pesaro (PU) can take part. The competition takes places in November every year; the best candidates and runners up receive prizes at the award ceremony in December.
*''Le Giornate della Traduzione Letteraria''&lt;ref name="Le Giornate"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Literary Translation Days|title=XII Giornate della Traduzione Letteraria|url=http://www.intralinea.org/news/item/xii_giornate_della_traduzione_letteraria|website=www.intralinea.org|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Literary Translation Days): the Literary Translation Days take place every year in late September - early October in  the historic city of [[Urbino]]. This event, which has been running since 2003, is organised by FUSP in collaboration with the International Studies Department of History, Language and Culture at the "[[University of Urbino|Carlo Bo]]" University. The Literary Translation Days are three days of seminars and debates held by writers, scholars, translators and publishers who analyse current issues and future horizons of the translation trade. In addition, two prizes are handed out during the event: the [[:it:Zanichelli|Zanichelli]] award and [[Arnoldo Mondadori Editore|Harlequin Mondadori]] award. The former celebrates the career of a translator or person who has contributed significantly to the translator industry (previous award winners include [[Daniel Pennac]] and [[Luis Sepúlveda]]); the latter awards one of the participants of the event who is given the chance to translate a chapter from a romance novel from English into Italian.
*The New York Symposium&lt;ref name=NYU&gt;{{cite web|last1=NY|title=Misano Adriatico sigla partnership con NY|url=http://www.romagnagazzette.com/2015/01/15/misano-adriatico-siglata-partnership-tra-la-fondazione-san-pellegrino-e-luniversita-di-new-york/|website=www.romagnagazzette.com|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each fall since 2011, the [http://nsts.fusp.it/ Nida School of Translation Studies] has convened a high-level research symposium in [[New York City|New York]] City, seeking to bring into dialogue varied perspectives on an established theme in translation. At each gathering, two preeminent authorities in the field present their research and observations; two equally distinguished scholars are invited to respond. From September 2015, FUSP will be responsible for the organisation of this high-profile event.

A '''search warrant''' is a [[court order]] that a [[magistrate]] or [[judge]] issues to authorize [[Police|law enforcement]] officers to conduct a [[Search and seizure|search]] of a person, location, or vehicle for [[evidence]] of a [[crime]] and to [[Confiscation|confiscate]] any evidence they find.  In most countries a search warrant cannot be issued in aid of civil process.

Jurisdictions that respect the [[rule of law]] and a right to privacy constrain police powers, and typically require search [[warrant (law)|warrant]]s or an equivalent procedure for searches police conducted in the course of a [[criminal investigation]]. The laws usually make an exception for [[hot pursuit]]: a [[police officer]] following a criminal who has fled the scene of a crime has the right to enter a property where the criminal has sought shelter. This contrasts with [[authoritarian]] regimes, where police typically can search property and people without having to provide justification or secure [[court]] permission.

==United Kingdom==
In [[England and Wales]], a local [[Magistrate#United Kingdom|magistrate]] issues search warrants, which require that a [[constable]] provide evidence that supports the warrant application. In the majority of cases where police already hold someone in custody, police can search premises{{clarify|date=September 2012}} without a search warrant under Section 18 of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984|Police and Criminal Evidence Act]] (PACE), which requires only the authority of an [[Inspector#United Kingdom|inspector]].

Under Section 18(5)a of PACE, a constable can conduct a search immediately without an inspector's authorisation. This subsection allows a constable to search the home of a suspect(s) under arrest in their presence before they take the suspect to a police station (or other custody location). Under Section 32 of PACE, a constable who arrests a person who is on their own property or has just left their premises, may immediately search both the suspect and the immediate area.

In [[Scotland]], a country operating on the distinct legal system of [[Scots law]] compared to England and Wales - the restrictions governing the use and execution of search warrants are set out under Part XIII under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. Search warrants must be signed by a [[Sheriff (Scotland)|Sheriff]] after a petition from police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/46/section/296|title=Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995|last=|first=|date=|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=National Archives|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gas company officials may enter a home to inspect, repair, or replace [[gas meter]]s and gas appliances by obtaining a warrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Farin|title=Breaking and metering|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/watchdog/2010/04/breaking_and_metering.html|accessdate=27 October 2012|newspaper=BBC Watchdog|date=29 April 2010|quote=British Gas are legally entitled to enter anyone's home if the householder hasn't paid the bill and won't let them in, but they need a warrant from a magistrate, who must be satisfied the information British Gas shows them is correct. In most cases, British Gas also must have issued a prior warning.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
To get a warrant, police must present a judge with an ITO (information to obtain) form that contains reasonable and probable grounds to believe that an offence has been or is being committed, and that the authorization sought will afford evidence of that offence. This hearing is 'ex parte' meaning only the crown is present. This fact obliges the police to include any known facts that hurt their application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Faloney|first1=Bernard|title=Rules of Evidence|url=http://freelegalhelp.ca/evidence.html#toWarrants|website=freelegalhelp.ca|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a search the occupants have a copy of the warrant and may get hold of the ITO through crown disclosure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Faloney|first1=Bernard|title=Criminal Procedure|url=http://freelegalhelp.ca/procedure.html|website=freelegalhelp.ca|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; if the occupant(s) are charged. There are numerous different warrant procedures in the Criminal Code, some have specific requirements such as being served during daytime or having a named supervising officer present in the case of a home search.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1989/1989canlii109/1989canlii109.html  R. v. Genest  1 SCR 59 (1989) canlii]&lt;/ref&gt; If these(see link)&lt;ref&gt;[http://freelegalhelp.ca/evidence.html#toWarrants Canada search warrant &amp; ITO requirements]&lt;/ref&gt; requirements are not met by the police the evidence found may become inadmissible against the accused at trial.

==United States==
[[File:Request for Search Warrant - NARA - 285161.tif|thumb|right|220px|Request for a search warrant dated December 11, 1905]]

Under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], most police searches require a search warrant based on [[probable cause]], although there are exceptions. In the absence of valid consent or an exception to the warrant requirement, whether for purposes of effecting a search or an arrest, police entry in an individual's home always requires a warrant. The probable cause standard for obtaining a search warrant is lower than the [[Legal burden of proof|quantum of proof]] required for a later conviction, [[Reasonable doubt|proof beyond a reasonable doubt]].

Under the Fourth Amendment, search warrants must be reasonable and specific. This means that a search warrant must reasonably identify the items to be searched for and the place where law enforcement officials are authorized to search for those items. Unless an exception to the warrant requirement applies, the search of other buildings or areas of a building, persons or vehicles, or the search for additional items that do not reasonably fall under the original warrant, will normally require additional search warrants.

To obtain a search warrant, an officer must prove to a [[United States magistrate judge|magistrate]] or [[United States judge|judge]] that probable cause exists for the proposed search, based upon direct information (i.e., the officer's personal observation) or other reliable information. An application for a search warrant will often rely upon [[Hearsay in United States law|hearsay information]], such as information obtained from a confidential [[informant]], as long as probable cause exists based on the [[totality of the circumstances]]. Police can seize both property and persons under a search warrant.  The rationale is that evidence police collect without a search warrant may not be sufficient to convict, but may be sufficient to suggest that a warrant would allow police to find enough evidence to convict.

The issue of federal warrants is determined under [[Title 18 of the United States Code]]. The law has been restated and extended under Rule 41 of the [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 41. Search and Seizure|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_41|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal search warrants may be prepared on Form AO 93, Search and Seizure Warrant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscourts.gov/forms/AO093.pdf AO 93 (Rev. 12/09) Search and Seizure Warrant]. Uscourts.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the laws are broadly similar, each state has its own laws and rules of procedure governing the issuance of warrants.

Search warrants are normally available to the public.  On the other hand, they may be sealed if they contain sensitive information. &lt;ref&gt;[https://multimedia.journalism.berkeley.edu/tutorials/police-records/  Paul Grabowicz, “Tutorial: Police Records” UC Berkely Graduate School of Journalism – Advanced Media Institute, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exceptions===
{{main article|Warrantless searches in the United States}}

Certain searches don't require a search warrant. For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What Are Your Fourth Amendment Rights|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/fires/fourth_amendment.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=11 September 2017|date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Consent''': a warrant is not required when a person in control of the object or property gives [[consent]] for the search.
* '''[[Hot pursuit]]''' of a [[felony|felon]] (to prevent a felon's escape or ability to harm others);
* '''Imminent [[Spoliation of evidence|destruction of evidence]]''': where evidence might be destroyed before a warrant can be properly obtained;
* '''Emergency searches''': such as where someone is heard screaming for help inside a dwelling; or
* Search incident to arrest (to mitigate the risk of harm to the arresting officers specifically).&lt;ref&gt;[{{SCOTUS URL|oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/02-811.pdf}} ''Groh v. Ramirez'', 540 U.S. 551, 564-65 (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Public safety''': a warrantless search may be permissible in an emergency situation where the public is in danger.
* [[plain view doctrine|Plain view]]: evidence is in the plain view of law enforcement officers, from a lawful vantage point (with similar exceptions that include plain smell, where the officer detects an odor that clearly indicates the presence of contraband or criminal activity).

In a plain view case, the officer is legitimately on the premises, his observation is from a legitimate vantage point, and it is immediately obvious that the evidence is contraband. The plain view rule applies, for example, when the officer has pulled the suspect over for a seat belt violation and sees a [[syringe]] on the passenger seat.&lt;ref name="Findlaw1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fourth Amendment: Annotation Four|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment04/04.html|work=Annotations to the Fourth Amendment|publisher=FindLaw|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protective sweep====
If the subject is arrested in a home or vehicle, police may perform a protective search to make sure that there are no weapons within the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joseph|first1=Paul R.|title=The Protective Sweep Doctrine: Protecting Arresting Officers from Attack by Persons Other Than the Arrestee|journal=Catholic University Law Review|date=1983|volume=33|page=95|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/cathu33&amp;div=9&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, they may search for weapons the room where they arrested the subject of a warrant, and conduct a "protective sweep" of the premises if they reasonably suspect that other individuals may be hiding.

====Rental properties and hotel rooms====
With rented property, a [[landlord]] may refuse to allow law enforcement to search a tenant's apartment without a search warrant, and police must obtain a warrant under the same guidelines as if the tenant were the owner of the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Landlords, Tenants, and Police Civil Liability|journal=AELE Monthly Law Journal|date=June 2009|volume=101|issue=6|page=101|url=http://www.aele.org/law/2009all06/2009-06MLJ101.pdf|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who are occupying rooms at hotels or motels have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their rooms. However, a warrantless search may be possible if the hotel guest has property in their room a considerable period of time after the scheduled check-out time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Jason C.|title=Do Not Disturb: Fourth Amendment Expectations of Privacy in Hotel Rooms|journal=Seton Hall Circuit Review|date=2010|volume=7|page=269|url=http://scholarship.shu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1048&amp;context=circuit_review|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Motor vehicle exception====
As first established by ''[[Carroll v. United States]]'', police are allowed to [[automobile exception|search a vehicle without a search warrant]] when they have probable cause to believe that [[evidence]] or [[contraband]] is located in a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;Regini, L. A. (July 1999). "The Motor Vehicle Exception: When and Where to Search." ''[[FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin]]''. 68, 27-33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hendrie, E. (August 2005). "[https://www.fbi.gov/publications/leb/2005/august2005/august05leb.htm#page22 The Motor Vehicle Exception]." ''FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin'', 74.&lt;/ref&gt; When police arrest an individual shortly after the individual has exited a vehicle, the police may conduct a full search of the suspect's person, any area within that person's immediate reach, and the passenger compartment of the recently occupied vehicle for weapons or any other contraband. However, ''[[Arizona v. Gant]]'' limits such searches to circumstances where the arrested person could have accessed the vehicle, or when the vehicle could contain evidence of the crime the person is arrested for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arizona v. Gant, 556 US 332, 129 S. Ct. 1710, 173 L. Ed. 2d 485 (2009)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16930540025490515536|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per ''[[Collins v. Virginia]]'', the exception does not apply when the vehicle is on the private property of its owner.

====Border search exception====
{{main article|Border search exception}}
Under [[Border search exception|The Border Search Exception]] custom and immigration officers are not required to have a warrant or [[probable cause]] to conduct [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]] at [[Borders of the United States|international borders]] and their functional equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coletta|first1=Christine A.|title=Laptop searches at the United States borders and the border search exception to the fourth amendment|journal=Boston College Law Review|date=2007|volume=48|page=971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This doctrine is not actually an exception to the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], but rather to the Amendment's requirement for a warrant or probable cause. Balanced against the sovereign's interests at the border are the Fourth Amendment rights of entrants. Not only is the expectation of privacy less at the border than in the interior, the Fourth Amendment balance between the interests of the Government and the privacy right of the individual is also struck much more favorably to the Government at the border. This balance at international borders means that routine searches are "reasonable" there, and therefore do not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]'s [[proscription]] against "unreasonable searches and seizures".

===Delayed notice===
A [[sneak and peek warrant|sneak and peek search warrant]] (officially called a delayed notice warrant and also a covert entry search warrant or a surreptitious entry search warrant) is a search warrant authorizing the law enforcement officers executing it to effect physical entry into private premises without the owner's or the occupant's permission or knowledge and to clandestinely search the premises.

===Gag orders===
In California, the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act mandates that in certain cases concerning electronic search warrants that the court issue [[gag order]]s "[...] prohibiting any party providing information from notifying any other party that information has been sought [...]".&lt;ref&gt;See the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Sec. 1, codified at {{cite web|title=California Penal Code, Sec. 1546.2.|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=1546.2.|website=California Legislative Information|publisher=California State Legislature|accessdate=11 September 2017}} ("(b)(1) When a warrant is sought or electronic information is obtained in an emergency under Section 1546.1, the government entity may submit a request supported by a sworn affidavit for an order delaying notification and prohibiting any party providing information from notifying any other party that information has been sought. The court shall issue the order [....]")&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sentence-final particles''', including [[modal particle]]s,&lt;ref name="Lin1"&gt;{{cite book | last=Lin | first=Huey Hannah | title=Contextualizing Linguistic Politeness in Chinese  | url=http://www.ohiolink.edu/etd/send-pdf.cgi/Lin%20Huey%20Hannah.pdf?acc_num=osu1109961198 | year=2005 | publisher=The Ohio State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; interactional particles,&lt;ref name=Morita&gt;{{cite book | last=Morita | first=Emi | title=Negotiation of Contingent Talk:The Japanese interactional particles ''ne'' and ''sa''. | year=2005 | publisher=John Benjamins}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc., are minimal [[lexeme]]s (words) that occur at the end of a sentence and that do not carry [[referential]] meaning, but may relate to [[linguistic modality]], [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] or other [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] effects. Sentence-final particles are common in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], including particles such as [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] ''le'' 了, ''ne'' 呢, ''ba'' 吧,  ''ou'' 哦, ''a'' 啊, ''la'' 啦, ''ya'' 呀, and ''ma'' 嗎/吗, and [[Cantonese]] ''lo'' 囉 and ''ge'' 嘅. These particles act as [[Grammatical modifier|qualifiers]] of the clause or sentence they end. Sentence-final particles are also present in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;{{citation | last=Fox |first=Barbara | year=2007 | title=Principles shaping grammatical practices: an exploration. | publisher=Discourse Studies 9 | page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many East Asian languages, such as [[Thai language|Thai]], and especially in languages that have undergone heavy [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] influence, such as the [[Monguor|Monguor languages]].

==Examples==
{{Refimprove|date=April 2009}}

===Chinese===

[[Yuen Ren Chao]] has described sentence-final particles as "phrase suffixes": just as a word suffix is in construction with the word preceding it, a sentence-final particle or phrase suffix is "in construction with a preceding phrase or sentence, though phonetically closely attached to the syllable immediately preceding it".&lt;ref name="Chao"&gt;{{cite book | surname=Chao |given=Yuen Ren |author-link=Chao Yen Ren |title=A Grammar of Spoken Chinese |year=1968 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=0-520-00219-9 | page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Chao, the sentence-final particle is phonetically close to the last word before it, but syntactically it is equidistant from every word in the whole [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]].

While sentence-final particles usually do not carry meaning themselves or [[Denotation (semiotics)|denote]] anything explicit, they may be derived from words that do carry meaning when they occur in other contexts and serve different functions.&lt;ref name="Li &amp; Thompson"&gt;{{cite book |given1=Charles N. |surname1=Li |given2=Sandra A. |surname2=Thompson |author-link=Sandra Thompson (linguist) |title=Mandarin Chinese: A functional reference grammar |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-520-06610-6 |pages=238–318 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the sentence-final particles of [[Standard Chinese]] are unstressed and, unlike most syllables in the language, do not carry [[tone (linguistics)|tone]].&lt;ref name="Li &amp; Thompson"/&gt;

* ''le'' (了): expressing the currently state
* ''ne'' (呢): question particle for subjects already mentioned
* ''ba'' (吧): soliciting approval, polite suggestion
* ''ou'' (哦): friendly warning
* ''a'' (啊) or ''ya'' (呀): softening a question.  The combination ''le a'' may be contracted as ''la'' (啦).
* ''ma'' (嗎/吗): forming a [[tag question]]

A major use of sentence-final particles in Mandarin Chinese specifically is thought to be as a signal of the speaker's attitude, the intended [[Illocutionary act|force]] of the statement to which the particle is attached, and "how the utterance is to be taken by the hearer."&lt;ref name="Lin1"/&gt;  For example, the addition of a particle may soften the tone of a question that might sound presumptuous or inappropriate without the particle.  As such, sentence-final particles in this sense often perform an interpersonal function, rather than a grammatical one.  Nevertheless, there are cases in which sentence-final particles do perform grammatical functions, such as Mandarin ''ma'' 嗎/吗, the "question particle," which changes the grammatical mood of a sentence to [[Interrogative mood|interrogative]].  Likewise, even though sentence-final particles can usually be omitted from a sentence without making the sentence ungrammatical or changing its meaning,&lt;ref name="Lin1"/&gt; some particles do contain information critical to the interpretation of an utterance's meaning, such as Mandarin ''le'' 了.&lt;ref name="Li &amp; Thompson"/&gt;

===Japanese===
{{See also|Japanese particles}}
In Japanese, there are many sentence-final particles that are used in formal as well as colloquial speech. Some examples include:

* か ''ka'': question. It turns a declarative sentence into a question.
* っけ ''kke'': doubt. Used when one is unsure of something. For example, 昨日だったっけ？ (''kinō datta kke''), "Was it yesterday?".  Often used when talking to oneself.
* な ''na'': emotion. Used when one wants to express a personal feeling. May be used to state a fact in which one has emotional investment, to express one's admiration or emotional excitement, to soften an imperative, or to encourage agreement, as a mild imperative.
* なあ ''nā'': a lengthened version of the above, expresses strong emotion, either to encourage agreement, as above, or to express one's desires, e.g. 寿司を食べたいなぁ (''sushi wo tabetai naa''), "I want to eat sushi (so badly right now!)". 
* ね ''ne'': agreement. Used when the speaker wants to verify or otherwise show agreement, reach consensus, or build solidarity with the listener.
* の ''no'': emphatic/informal interrogative/indirect imperative. May be used to form informal questions, or to give some sort of emphasis to one's statement. Depending on intonation and context, it may soften a statement (particularly in women's language), or to strongly assert one's belief in something. In this sense, it may also act as an indirect imperative, by indicating what the speaker believes should happen, thus, what the listener is expected to do.
* さ ''sa'': casualness, assertiveness. Contrasts with ''ne'' in that, where ''ne'' helps build solidarity and agreement, ''sa'' is often used to assert the speaker's own ideas or opinions. It is often used repeatedly in conversation to retain a listener's attention.
* わ ''wa'': soft declarative or emphatic. Used primarily by women, this particle has a meaning similar to ''yo'', but it is less assertive.
* よ ''yo'': assertive. It means that you are asserting what preceded the particle as information you are confident in, particularly when supplying information the listener is believed not to know.
* ぜ ''ze'': informal hortative/emphatic. Used to push someone to do something, or to remind them of something. In certain contexts, it can carry a threatening overtone.
* ぞ ''zo'': assertive, emphatic. Used to strongly assert the speaker's decisions and opinions, and serves to discourage dissent or protest.

===English===

English also has some words and phrases that act somewhat like sentence final particles, but primarily only in colloquial speech.  However, there are others, called [[tag questions]], which are less colloquial and can be used for any situation.  All are generally [[discourse particle]]s rather than modal particles.  For example:
* "man" in "Don't do it, man."
* "right" in "The blue one, right?"
* "no" in "You want to go, no?" (slightly archaic)
* "don't you" in "You want to, don't you?"
* "are they" in "They're not hurt, are they?"
* "aren't they" in "They're here, aren't they?"
* "is it" in "The plate isn't broken, is it?"
* "isn't it" in "The plane is here, isn't it?"
All but the first are tag questions.  Notice how when the main sentence is affirmative, the tag question is negative, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;http://spanish.about.com/od/sentencestructure/g/question_tag_gl.htm Page is about Spanish, but mentions tag questions in English&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish===

In the same way that certain words and phrases are used as sentence final particles above in the section on [[English language|English]] (as [[discourse particles]]), some [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words and phrases can be used this way as well; once again, these are usually called [[tag question]]s.  For example:
* "verdad" (''right'') in "Te gustan los libros, ¿verdad?" (''You (informal) like books, right?'')
* "no" (''no'') in "Le toca pasar la aspiradora, ¿no?" (''It's your (formal) turn to vacuum, no?'')
* "no es verdad" (''isn't that right'') in "Eres de Perú, ¿no es verdad?" (''You're (informal) from Peru, isn't that right?'')
Note that in Spanish, the question marks are placed around the tag question, and not around the entire sentence (although English only uses the single final question mark, it is implied that the entire sentence, and not just the tag, is the question).&lt;ref&gt;http://spanish.about.com/od/sentencestructure/g/question_tag_gl.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In his writings, he harshly depicted [[Pune]], where he lived,  as a hub of [[Brahmin]] orthodoxy,.  He wrote several novels,  short stories, and essays, including award-winning novel ''Anandi Gopal'', which is a fictional account of the life of [[Anandi Gopal Joshi]]. The novel was later adapted into an award-winning play [[Anandi Gopal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-UjZlNCh-qwC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=Shrikrishna+Janardan+Joshi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=r1CjzUTi5K&amp;sig=BNprtZVamtksdWDKM4Gw1Got9ZY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwie3-3MseDVAhXFLFAKHfpMDYAQ6AEIWjAO#v=onepage&amp;q=Shrikrishna+Janardan+Joshi&amp;f=false|title=Making India: Colonialism, National Culture, and the Afterlife of Indian English Authority|first=Makarand R.|last=Paranjape|date=3 September 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|accessdate=18 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnmgc.com/gomu.php?menu=3&amp;id=203|title=Dr Anandibai Gopalrao Joshi|website=www.tnmgc.com|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{IPA|/m, p, b/}} are bilabial, whereas {{IPA|/f, ʋ/}} are labiodental.&lt;ref name="skp135"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Šuštaršič|Komar|Petek|1999|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/t, d, t͡s, s, z/}} and {{IPA|[d͡z]}} are dental {{IPA|[{{IPA link|t̪}}, {{IPA link|d̪}}, {{IPA link|t̪͡s̪}}, {{IPA link|s̪}}, {{IPA link|z̪}}, {{IPA link|d̪͡z̪}}]}},&lt;ref name="PreTok21"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pretnar|Tokarz|1980|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. {{IPA|/t, d/}} are [[Laminal consonant|laminal]] [[Denti-alveolar consonant|denti-alveolar]], while {{IPA|/t͡s, s, z/}} and {{IPA|[d͡z]}} are dentalized laminal [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], pronounced with the blade of the tongue very close to the upper front teeth, with the tip of the tongue resting behind lower front teeth.
* {{IPA|/n, l, r/}} are alveolar.&lt;ref name="PreTok21"/&gt; The first two are laminal denti-alveolar {{IPA|[{{IPA link|n̪}}, {{IPA link|l̪}}]}} before dental consonants. In addition, {{IPA|/n/}} is velar {{IPAblink|ŋ}} before velar consonants,&lt;ref name="PreTok21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="skp136"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Šuštaršič|Komar|Petek|1999|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it merges with {{IPA|/m/}} to a labiodental {{IPAblink|ɱ}} before labiodental consonants.&lt;ref name="skp136"/&gt;
** There is not a full agreement about the realization of {{IPA|/r/}}:
*** {{Harvcoltxt|Šuštaršič|Komar|Petek|1999}} consider it to be an alveolar tap {{IPAblink|ɾ}}.&lt;ref name="skp135"/&gt;
*** {{Harvcoltxt|Greenberg|2006}} states that it varies between an alveolar trill {{IPAblink|r}} and alveolar tap {{IPAblink|ɾ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Greenberg|2006|pp=17 and 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the book, he uses the latter symbol.
*** {{Harvcoltxt|Pretnar|Tokarz|1980}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Priestley|2002}} consider it to be an alveolar trill {{IPAblink|r}}.&lt;ref name="PreTok21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="priestley394"/&gt;
** {{IPA|/r/}} is [[Uvular consonant|uvular]] in a number of [[Upper Carniolan dialect group|Upper Carniolan]] and [[Carinthian dialect group|Carinthian]] dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Reindl|2008|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/r/}} may be [[Syllabic consonant|syllabic]]. {{IPA|/r̩/}} has also been described as the sequence {{IPA|/ər/}} (with an epenthetic {{IPA|[ə]}}). Jones (2002){{fix|text=full citation needed|date=December 2016}} found that a vocalic segment similar to {{IPA|[ə]}} occurs before (and occasionally after) both syllabic and non-syllabic {{IPA|/r/}}, and that it is shorter than epenthetic {{IPA|[ə]}}, leading to the conclusion that this is not epenthetic {{IPA|[ə]}}, but simply a feature of trill production in Slovene.
* {{IPA|/t͡ʃ, d͡ʒ, ʃ, ʒ/}} are palato-alveolar {{IPA|[{{IPA link|t͡ʃ}}, {{IPA link|d͡ʒ}}, {{IPA link|ʃ}}, {{IPA link|ʒ}}]}},&lt;ref name="skp135"/&gt; but they can be laminal [[Retroflex consonant|retroflex]] {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ʈ͡ʂ|ʈ̻͡ʂ̻}}, {{IPA link|ɖ͡ʐ|ɖ̻͡ʐ̻}}, {{IPA link|ʂ|ʂ̻}}, {{IPA link|ʐ|ʐ̻}}]}} for some speakers, particularly those living close to the Croatian border.

All [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] [[obstruent]]s are devoiced at the end of words unless immediately followed by a word beginning with a vowel or a voiced consonant. In consonant clusters, voicing distinction is neutralized and all consonants assimilate the voicing of the rightmost segment.  In this context, {{IPA|[v]}}, {{IPA|[ɣ]}} and {{IPA|[d͡z]}} may occur as voiced allophones of {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/t͡s/}}, respectively (e.g. ''vŕh drevésa'' {{IPA|[ˈʋərɣ drɛˈʋeːsa]}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Herrity|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA|/ʋ/}} has several [[allophones]] depending on context.
* Before a vowel, pronunciation is labiodental, {{IPAblink|ʋ}}&lt;ref name="skp136"/&gt; (also described as {{IPAblink|v}}).&lt;ref name="priestley394"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Priestley|2002|p=394}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gr18"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Greenberg|2006|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* After a vowel, pronunciation is bilabial {{IPAblink|w}} and forms a diphthong.&lt;ref name="skp136"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gr18"/&gt;
* At the beginning of a syllable, before a consonant (for example in ''vsi'' 'all'), the pronunciation varies more widely by speaker and area. Many speakers convert {{IPA|/ʋ/}} into a full vowel {{IPA|[u]}} in this position.&lt;ref name="skp136"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gr18"/&gt; For those speakers that retain a consonantal pronunciation, it is pronounced {{IPAblink|w}} before a voiced consonant and {{IPAblink|ʍ}} before a voiceless consonant.&lt;ref name="skp136"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gr18"/&gt; Thus, ''vsi'' may be pronounced as disyllabic {{IPA|[uˈsi]}} or monosyllabic {{IPA|[ʍsi]}}.

The preposition ''v'' is always bound to the following word; however its phonetic realization follows the normal phonological rules for {{IPA|/ʋ/}}.

The sequences {{IPA|/lj/}}, {{IPA|/nj/}} and {{IPA|/rj/}} occur only before a vowel. Before a consonant or word-finally, they are reduced to {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} respectively. This is reflected in the spelling in the case of {{IPA|/rj/}}, but not for {{IPA|/lj/}} and {{IPA|/nj/}}. The reduction of non-prevocalic {{IPA|/lj/}} and {{IPA|/nj/}} occurs in standard Slovene, but not for certain dialects, where speakers use {{IPAblink|ʎ}} and {{IPAblink|ɲ}} in this position instead.

Under certain (somewhat unpredictable) circumstances, historical {{IPA|/l/}} at the end of a syllable has become {{IPA|[w]}}, the allophone of {{IPA|/ʋ/}} in that position. This change has occurred in the endings of all past participles. For many derivatives of words ending in {{IPA|[w]}} that historically had {{IPA|/l/}}, both {{IPA|[l]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} can be used, sometimes depending on the context it is being used in.

== Vowels ==

[[Image:Slovenian vowel chart.svg|thumb|Vowels of Slovene, from {{Harvcoltxt|Šuštaršič|Komar|Petek|1999|p=137}}. {{IPA|/ɐ/}} is not shown.]]

Slovene has an eight-vowel&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Šuštaršič|Komar|Petek|1999|pp=136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Toporišič|2001|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; (according to Peter Jurgec nine-vowel)&lt;ref name="jurgec200712"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jurgec|2007|pp=1–2}}. He transcribes {{IPA|/ɐ/}} as {{IPA|/ʌ/}}, but the vowel chart on page 2 shows that the phonetically correct symbol is {{IPA|/ɐ/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jurgec2005912"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jurgec|2005|pp=9 and 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; system, in comparison to the five-vowel system of Serbo-Croatian.

* The close front vowel {{IPA|/i/}} is regularly pronounced as lax {{IPAblink|ɪ}} when {{IPA|/r/}} follows, so that e.g. ''mira'' 'myrrh' is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈmɪ̀ːɾa]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jurgec|2007|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The central vowels {{IPA|/ə/}} and {{IPA|/ɐ/}} are phonetically mid {{IPAblink|ə}} and near-open {{IPAblink|ɐ}}, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jurgec|2011|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurgec proposes the existence of a ninth vowel {{IPA|/ɐ/}} that in traditional pronunciation (see below under [[Slovene phonology#Prosody|Prosody]]) would rather be analyzed as a short {{IPA|/a/}}. However, since the more recent studies indicate that native speakers don't actually phonemically distinguish long and short vowels yet the distinction between {{IPA|/ɐ/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} is quite consistently perceived, and moreover there is a noticeable distinction in quality and a lesser distinction in quantity between these two vowels, there is reason to treat these two sounds as two different phonemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jurgec|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The near-open {{IPA|/ɐ/}} can only appear in the word-final stressed syllable before the syllable coda, as in ''čas'' {{IPA|[ˈt͡ʃɐs]}} 'time'. Due to the restrictions stated above, the open {{IPA|/a/}} usually appears in its place in other declinational forms of the same word: ''časa'' {{IPA|[ˈt͡ʃasa]}}, not {{IPA|[ˈt͡ʃɐsa]}}, 'time (gen.)'. The analysis as two different phonemes is also reinforced by the fact that in some words the phoneme {{IPA|/a/}} appears in the very same position that would permit {{IPA|/ɐ/}}, leading to a phonemic contrast: ''pas'' {{IPA|[ˈpas]}}, not {{IPA|[ˈpɐs]}}, 'belt'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jurgec|2011|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurgec also states that in the tonemic varieties of the language, the near-open vowel {{IPA|/ɐ/}} can carry only the high tone (see below), which is "parallel to the pattern for the [{{IPA|/ɛ/}}, {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and {{IPA|/ə/}}]." He also notes that similarly to {{IPA|/ɐ/}}, the schwa {{IPA|/ə/}} likewise only appears in closed syllables, i.e. as the nucleus before the syllable coda. On the basis of these observations he concludes that the near-open vowel {{IPA|/ɐ/}} "behaves in a systematic way within the vowel system of Slovenian."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jurgec|2011|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to {{Harvcoltxt|Jurgec|2007}}, {{IPA|/ə/}} is inserted epenthetically, and its distribution is fully predictable. He also says that "[d]escriptions of schwa distribution are offer[ed] in lexical rather than grammatical terms. These were also based on historical data and did not consider actual speech of educated speakers in Ljubljana, nowadays considered standard."&lt;ref name="jurgec20071"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jurgec|2007|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialectal distribution of {{IPA|/e/}} vs. {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} vs. {{IPA|/ɔ/}} is inconsistent with the distribution in Standard Slovene. This influences the way speakers of such dialects speak Standard Slovene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jurgec|2005|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slovene has been traditionally described as distinguishing vowel length, which correlates with stress and is therefore discussed in the prosody section, below. The distinction between {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/e/}}, and between {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} is only made when they are stressed and long. When short or unstressed, they are not distinguished: short stressed variants are realized as open-mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɛ}}, {{IPA link|ɔ}}]}}, while the unstressed variants are, broadly speaking, true-mid vowels {{IPA|[{{IPA link|e̞}}, {{IPA link|o̞}}]}}. In fact, however, the unstressed mid vowels have two realizations:
* Lowered close-mid (between close-mid and true-mid) {{IPA|[e̞, o̞]}} before a stressed syllable (as in ''v'''e'''likan'' 'giant' and '''''o'''glas'' 'advertisement').&lt;ref name="srebotrejec"&gt;{{cite web|title=On the vowel system in present-day Slovene|author=Tatjana Srebot-Rejec|url=http://nl.ijs.si/isjt98/zbornik/sdjt98-Srebot.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="solar54"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Šolar|1950|p=54}}, cited in Srebot-Rejec's paper&lt;/ref&gt;
* Raised open-mid (between true-mid and open-mid) {{IPA|[ɛ̝, ɔ̝]}} after a stressed syllable (as in ''medv'''e'''d'' 'bear' and ''pot'''o'''k'' 'stream').&lt;ref name="srebotrejec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="solar54"/&gt;
The unstressed mid vowels are never as close as the stressed close-mid vowels {{IPA|/e, o/}} and never as open as the stressed open-mid vowels {{IPA|/ɛ, ɔ/}}.&lt;ref name="srebotrejec"/&gt; However, {{Harvcoltxt|Šuštaršič|Komar|Petek|1999}} report true-mid allophones {{IPA|[{{IPA link|e̞}}, {{IPA link|o̞}}]}} of the close-mid vowels {{IPA|/e, o/}} occurring in the sequences {{IPA|/ej/}} and {{IPA|/oʋ/}}, but only if a vowel does not follow within the same word.&lt;ref name="skp138a"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Šuštaršič|Komar|Petek|1999|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; One could therefore argue that the unstressed mid vowels are simply allophones of the close-mid vowels, whereas the open-mid vowels do not occur in unstressed positions. Another argument for transcribing the unstressed mid vowels as {{IPA|/e, o/}} is that these symbols are easier to write than {{IPA|/ɛ, ɔ/}}.

In the colloquial spoken language, unstressed and most short stressed vowels tend to be reduced or elided. For example, ''kȕp'' ('heap') &gt; {{IPA|[kə́p]}}, ''právimo'' ('we say') &gt; {{IPA|[prâwmo]}}.&lt;ref name="priestley394"/&gt;

== Prosody ==

Scholars&lt;ref&gt;For example {{Harvcoltxt|Srebot-Rejec|1988}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Šuštaršič|Komar|Petek|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; have found that vowel length in standard Slovene is no longer distinctive,&lt;ref name="skp136"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jurgec20071"/&gt;&lt;ref name="srebotrejec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="srebotrejec1988"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Srebot-Rejec|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the only differences in vowel length are that the stressed vowels are longer than the unstressed ones,&lt;ref name="srebotrejec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="skp137"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Šuštaršič|Komar|Petek|1999|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that stressed open syllables are longer than stressed closed syllables.&lt;ref name="srebotrejec"/&gt; Stressed syllables are characterized by amplitude and pitch prominence.&lt;ref name="skp137"/&gt;

In tonemic varieties, stressed syllables also have a distinction of phonemic tone (high or low).

All dialects of Slovene have phonemic stress, but the same word can be accented quite differently in different dialects. Most words have a single syllable that carries stress. Some compounds, but not all, have multiple stresses, inherited from the parts that make up the compound. There are also a few small words and clitics, including prepositions, that have no inherent stress at all and attach prosodically to another word.

=== In traditional pronunciation ===

In non-final syllables, quantitative accent (increased syllable length) is also present in almost all words. In tonemic varieties, stressed syllables also have a distinction of phonemic tone (high or low). Stress and vowel length are closely intertwined:&lt;ref name="Priestley 2002 390"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Priestley|2002|p=390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A non-final syllable that bears stress will automatically have a long vowel. Conversely, at most one vowel in a Slovene word is long, and it automatically bears the stress.
* If a word has no long vowels, the stress usually falls on the final syllable. However, a limited number of words have non-final stress on short syllables.
* The combination {{IPA|/ər/}}, although phonetically short, may be stressed and behaves as a long vowel in that case. In particular, it may carry tonal distinctions.
* Schwa {{IPA|/ə/}} in other positions can also carry the stress, but does not have tonal distinctions and thus behaves as a short vowel.

Note that vowel length is clearly phonemic in stressed final syllables, which can be either long or short. In other syllables, however, whether vowel length or stress, or both, are phonemic depends on the underlying phonological analysis. Generally speaking, stress and length co-occur in all but the final syllable, so one feature or the other is phonetically redundant in those words.

=== Tone ===

The standard language has two varieties, tonemic and non-tonemic. These differ only in the presence of phonemic tonal distinctions on stressed syllables (i.e. [[pitch accent]]) in the former. Phonemic tone exists only in a north-south band of dialects in the center of the country (the [[Upper Carniolan dialect group|Upper]] and [[Lower Carniolan dialect group]]s and part of the [[Carinthian dialect group]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Priestley|2002|p=449}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because the Slovenian capital city [[Ljubljana]] is located within the central tonemic dialect area, phonemic tone was included in the standard language, and in fact the tonemic variety is more prestigious and is universally used in formal TV and radio broadcasts.

The exact distribution and phonetic realization of tonemes varies locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Greenberg|2006|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Standard Slovene, some words with the traditionally long vowels {{IPA|/aː, eː, oː, iː, uː/}} may have either a high or low tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Greenberg|2006|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless otherwise noted, this article discusses the tonemes as they are realized in Standard Slovene spoken in Ljubljana.

In the tonemic variety, the following additional rules apply to '''stressed''' vowels (unstressed vowels never carry tonal distinction):

* Long vowels as well as tautosyllabic stressed {{IPA|/ər/}} (i.e. stressed {{IPA|/ər/}} not directly followed by a vowel in the same word) can bear either a high or low tone. (The terms ''falling'' or ''circumflex'' are sometimes used in place of ''high''; likewise, ''rising'' or ''acute'' may be used in place of ''low''.)
* High-tone low-mid {{IPA|/ɛ́ː, ɔ́ː/}} are uncommon.
* Short vowels other than {{IPA|/ə/}} are always high-tone.
* {{IPA|/ə/}} (when not part of a stressed {{IPA|/ər/}} combination) is normally tonemically high in final syllables and low elsewhere.

This leads to the following possible combinations of tone, length and vowel quality:

Note that tautosyllabic stressed {{IPA|/ər/}} behaves like a long vowel in terms of the tones it can bear, and in fact it is notated as such in the tonemic writing system (see above). Examples: ''pr̂stnica'' ('phalanx') with high tone vs. ''pŕstanəc'' ('finger') with low tone. However, since it does not have any length distinction, it is equally valid to class it as a short vowel.

The non-tonemic system is identical to the tonemic system above in terms of vowel length and stress, but lacks any phonemic tone. This means that, for those dialects, the first and second rows merge, as do the third and fourth.

Similarly, for many&lt;ref name="skp136"/&gt;&lt;ref name="srebotrejec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="srebotrejec1988"/&gt; speakers who do not distinguish short and long vowels, the first and third rows merge, as do the second and fourth. An exception to this is the traditional {{IPA|/á/}}, which does not merge with {{IPA|/áː/}}. Instead, the former is realized as {{IPA|[ɐ́]}}.&lt;ref name="jurgec2005912"/&gt;

===Sample===
The sample text is a reading of the first sentence of [[The North Wind and the Sun]]. The transcription is based on a recording of two speakers, a female and a male, from Ljubljana.&lt;ref name="skp135"/&gt; It does not indicate tone.&lt;ref name="skp138a"/&gt;

====Phonemic transcription====
{{IPA|/ˈseʋərni ˈʋetər in ˈsont͡sɛ sta sɛ prɛˈpirala {{!}} kaˈteri ɔd ˈnjiju jɛ mɔt͡ʃˈnejʃi {{!}} kɔ jɛ ˈmimɔ priˈʃɛʋ pɔˈpotnik {{!}} zaˈʋit ʋ ˈtɔpəʋ ˈplaʃt͡ʃ/}}&lt;ref name="skp138b"&gt;Based on the transcription in {{Harvcoltxt|Šuštaršič|Komar|Petek|1999|p=138}}. Authors state that indicating both vowel length and stress is "considerably redundant".&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phonetic transcription====
{{IPA|[ˈseʋəɾni ˈʋetəɾ in ˈsont͡sɛ sta sɛ pɾɛˈpiɾala {{!}} kaˈteɾi ɔd ˈnjiju jɛ mɔt͡ʃˈnejʃi {{!}} kɔ jɛ ˈmimɔ pɾiˈʃɛw pɔˈpotnik {{!}} zaˈʋit u ˈtɔpəw ˈplaʃt͡ʃ]}}&lt;ref name="skp138b"/&gt;

'''Supergrass''' is a British [[slang]] term for an [[informant]] who [[Turn state's evidence|turns Queen's evidence]], often in return for protection and [[immunity from prosecution]]. In the British criminal world, police informants have been called "grasses" since the late 1930s, and the "super" prefix was coined by journalists in the early 1970s to describe those who [[turn state's evidence|witnessed against fellow criminals]] in a series of high-profile mass trials at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?62+Law+&amp;+Contemp.+Probs.+203+(Spring+1999)#F88 Jackson, John D. "THE JURY SYSTEM IN CONTEMPORARY IRELAND: IN THE SHADOW OF A TROUBLED PAST."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
The first known use of "grass" in that context is Arthur Gardner's [[crime novel]] ''Tinker's Kitchen'', published in 1932, in which a "grass" is defined as "an informer".&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Arthur. ''Tinker's Kitchen''; R. L. Allan; 1932; ASIN  B000S66R7Q&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the term "grass" being used as signifying a traitor, a person who informs on people he or she knows intimately, ostensibly can be traced to the expression "snake in the grass", which has a similar meaning.&lt;ref&gt;See ''McGraw-Hill Dictionary of American Idioms and Phrasal Verbs'', The McGraw-Hill Companies, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase derives from the writings of [[Virgil]] (in [[Latin language|Latin]], ''latet anguis in herba'') and has been known in the English language, meaning "traitor", since the late 17th century.&lt;ref name=phra&gt;[http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/grass-up.html "grass up" (v.)], Gary Martin, PhraseFinder online&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative claim is made for the term originating from [[rhyming slang]], whereby "grasshopper" is defined as "copper", meaning "policeman".&lt;ref name=slang&gt;
Farmer, John Stephen &amp; [[William Ernest Henley]] ''Dictionary of Slang''; 1893&lt;/ref&gt; The rhyming slang version was supported in 1950 by lexicographer Paul Tempest, who wrote&lt;ref&gt;Tempest, Paul ''Lag's lexicon: A comprehensive dictionary and encyclopaedia of the English prison to-day''; Routledge &amp; K.Paul; 1950; ASIN: B0000CHSO0&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Grasser. One who gives information. A "squealer" or "squeaker". The origin derives from rhyming slang: grasshopper – copper; a "grass" or "grasser" tells the "copper" or policeman.}}

==Usage in Northern Ireland==
In [[Northern Ireland]], the term "supergrass" especially refers to arrested paramilitaries who divulged the identities of their compatriots to the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]], possibly in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Sir [[John Hermon]] did not deny reports that inducements were paid but denied figures as high as £50,000 were involved.&lt;ref&gt;''Informers crippling IRA...''; [[The Times]]; 25 Mar 1982; pg1 col E&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term in Northern Ireland began with the arrest of [[Christopher Black (informer)|Christopher Black]] in 1981. After securing assurances that he would have protection from prosecution, Black gave statements which led to 38 arrests. On 5 August 1983, 22 members of the [[Provisional IRA]] were sentenced to a total of more than 4,000 cumulative years in prison, based on Black's testimonies alone (eighteen of these convictions were overturned on appeal on 17 July 1986).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

| date = 1983-08-05
| newspaper = BBC
| access-date = 2016-02-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1982, 25 more 'supergrasses' had surfaced contributing to the arrests of over six hundred people from [[paramilitary]] organizations, such as the Provisional IRA, the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) and the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]]. On 11 April 1983, members of the [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] Ulster Volunteer Force were jailed on the evidence of supergrass [[Joseph Bennett (informer)|Joseph Bennett]]. These convictions were all overturned on 24 December 1984. In October 1983, seven people were convicted on the evidence provided by supergrass [[Kevin McGrady]] although the trial judge Lord Chief Justice Robert Lowry had described McGrady's evidence as "bizarre, incredible and contradictory".&lt;ref&gt;''Fortnight: An Independent Review For Northern Ireland'', p.5, 2–15 June 1986 edition&lt;/ref&gt; The last supergrass trial finished on 18 December 1985, when 25 members of the INLA were jailed on the evidence of [[Harry Kirkpatrick]]. Twenty-four of these convictions were later overturned on 23 December 1986.

Many convictions based on supergrass testimony were later overturned, and the supergrass system was discontinued in 1985 until reintroduction in 2011. The first supergrass trial in 26 years began on 8 September 2011 for the murder of [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA) member [[Tommy English (loyalist)|Tommy English]]. In Northern Ireland the term "tout" is a popular alternative to "grass". The [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] have refused to use this term and prefer the term [[Assisting Offender]], based on the legislation that enables the use of such evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other usages==
The term has been used more recently to describe an informant with [[al-Qaeda]] links testifying at the trials for seven British men conspiring to cause explosions between 1 January 2003 and 31 March 2004, and again on 2 July 2007 in an article in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' describing a search for informants in the [[2007 Glasgow Airport attack]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=465481&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ct=5 "'Terror ringleader' is brilliant NHS doctor", 27 Aug 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134805/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=465481&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ct=5 |date=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used by ''[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]]'', a daily newspaper in Bermuda, a British dependent territory. An article in the paper uses the term to describe a Transport Control Department worker convicted of selling driver's licenses to Portuguese applicants lacking the necessary English skills to pass the multiple choice exam.  The worker was granted a conditional discharge in exchange for information on other Transport Control Department employees abusing the public trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalgazette.com/rg/Article/article.jsp?articleId=7d9a32f30030005&amp;sectionId=60 TCD worker gave exam passes to Portuguese drivers for bribes. 6 October 2009]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most prolific supergrasses in recent British history was [[Michael Michael]] whose evidence in 2001 led to 32 criminals being convicted, including his own mother, and the disruption of a £132 million drug ring.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120913025850/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-811197-britains-biggest-supergrass.do Britain's biggest supergrass]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Thai spelling reform of 1942''' was initiated by the government of Prime Minister Field Marshal [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]]. The prime minister's office announced a simplification of the [[Thai alphabet]] on 29 May 1942. The announcement was published in the ''Royal Gazette'' on 1 June 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1942 Thai spelling reform announcement|url=http://rikker.blogspot.com/2008/06/1942-thai-spelling-reform-announcement.html|website=Thai 101|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ประกาสสำนักนายกรัถมนตรี เรื่องการปรับปรุงตัวอักสรไทย|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2485/A/035/1137.PDF|website=Royal Gazette (Thailand)|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=1942-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reform was cancelled by the government of [[Khuang Aphaiwong]] on 2 August 1944. Following the November 1947 coup, Phibunsongkhram became prime minister for a second time, but did not revive the [[Thai language]] reform.

==Proposed simplification of the Thai writing system ==
The redundancy of the Thai writing system is retained, especially similar to [[Lao language]]. The changes to simplify Thai spelling were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Simplifed Thai spelling during World War II|url=http://rikker.blogspot.com/2008/02/simplifed-thai-spelling-during-world.html|website=Thai 101|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*All of วรรค ฎ (i.e., ฎ ฏ ฐ ฑ ฒ ณ), the section of the alphabet corresponding to the [[wikt:Indic|Indic]] [[retroflex consonant]]s, is gone, being replaced by their corresponding consonants in วรรค ด (ด ต ถ ท ธ น).
*ใ is uniformly replaced with ไ.
*ญ is replaced with ย in initial position (e.g., ใหญ่ &gt; ไหย่), but retained in final position without its "base" (ฐาน), as seen on the title page in the word สามัญ.
*Of the three high /s/ consonants, ศ ษ ส, only ส is retained (e.g., ศึกษา &gt; สึกสา).
*Initial /s/ cluster ทร is replaced by ซ (e.g., กระทรวง &gt; กะซวง).
*The leading อ in the four words อยาก อย่า อย่าง อยู่ is replaced by ห.
*Many silent consonants that do not add to the pronunciation are eliminated (e.g., จริง &gt; จิง, ศาสตร์ &gt; สาตร).
*Some clusters are reduced (e.g., กระทรวง &gt; กะซวง).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6373">The '''three-language formula''' for language learning was formulated in 1968 by the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development|Ministry of Education]] of the [[Government of India]] in consultation with the states. The formula as enunciated in the 1968 National Policy Resolution which provided for the study of "Hindi, English and modern Indian language (preferably one of the southern languages) in the Hindi speaking states and Hindi, English and the Regional language in the non-Hindi speaking States".&lt;ref name=nic&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Language Formula|url=http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/u/47/3X/473X0I01.htm|publisher=Government Of India Ministry Of Human Resource Development Department Of Education|accessdate=16 May 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222082907/http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/u/47/3X/473X0I01.htm|archivedate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula was formulated in response to demands from non-Hindi speaking states of the [[South India|South]], such as [[Karnataka]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and mainly [[Tamil Nadu]]. Currently, the three language system is not followed in Tamil Nadu due to efforts of former Chief Minister [[C. N. Annadurai]].

==History==
The first recommendation for a three-language policy was made by the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Education Commission]] in 1948–49, which did not find the requirement to study three languages to be an extravagance, citing the precedents of the Netherlands and Switzerland. While accepting that [[Hindi]] was itself a minority language, and had no superiority over others such as [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]],  [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]],[[Urdu]] and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] all of which had a longer history and greater body of literature, the commission still foresaw Hindi as eventually replacing English as the means by which every province may participate in Federal functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the University Education Commission (December 1948 – August 1949) Volume I|url=http://www.academics-india.com/Radhakrishnan%20Commission%20Report%20of%201948-49.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Education, Government of India|accessdate=16 May 2016|page=280|date=1962|quote=Every boy and girl must obviously know the regional language, at the same time he should be acquainted with the Federal language, and should acquire the ability to read books in English.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Education Commission of 1965–66 recommended a modified or graduated three-language formula. Following some debate, the original three-language formula was adopted by the [[India Parliament]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=Weinstein&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weinstein|first1=Brian|title=Language Policy and Political Development|date=1990|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-89391-611-0|page=95|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yrxjUJcgkHUC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;q=graduated+three-language+formula|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1986 National Policy on Education reiterated the 1968 formula.&lt;ref name=nic/&gt;

In 1972 the government launched a committee for promotion of Urdu under the chairmanship of [[I. K. Gujral]]. The committee's 1975 report recommended safeguards for significant (i.e. greater than 10 percent) Urdu-speaking minorities which included the use of Urdu for official purposes and as a medium of instruction. Following consideration of the report by the Cabinet in 1979, and by the Taraqqui-e-Urdu Board from 1979 to 1983, modified proposals from the Gujral committee were passed on to the state governments in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gujral Committee Report on Urdu|url=http://www.languageinindia.com/jan2009/gujralreport.html|website=Language In India|accessdate=16 May 2016|date=8 May 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new committee of experts was launched in 1990 under the chairmanship of [[Ali Sardar Jafri]] to  examine implementation of the Gujral committee recommendations. This committee recommended modifying the three-language formula to "In Hindi speaking States: (a) Hindi (with Sanskrit as part of the composite course); (b) Urdu or any other modern Indian language and (c) English or any other modern European language. In non-Hindi speaking States: (a) the regional language; (b) Hindi; (c) Urdu or any other modern Indian language excluding (a) and (b); and (d) English or any other modern European language".&lt;ref name=nic/&gt;

==Criticism==
[[C. N. Annadurai]], then [[Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu]], opposed the requirement to learn Hindi in Tamil Nadu, "What serves to link us with the outside world is certainly capable of rendering the same service inside India as well. To plead for two link languages is like boring a smaller hole in a wall for the kitten while there is a bigger one for the cat. What suits the cat will suit the kitten as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anna and the Dravidian Movement|url=http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/blogs/southasiamasala/2010/02/15/india-anna-and-the-dravidian-movement/|website=South Asia Masala|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics have noted the failure of the formula. Harold F. Schiffman, an expert on Dravidian culture at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], observed that the formula "has been honored in the breach more than in reality" and that due the lack of a symbolic national language, there is a tendency "for English to take over as the instrumental language" in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schiffman|first=Harold|title=Indian Linguistic Culture and the Genesis of Language Policy in the Subcontinent|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/540/handouts/indiapol/indic2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist Brian Weinstein of [[Howard University]] said that "neither Hindi nor non-Hindi speaking states followed the (1968) directive".&lt;ref name=Weinstein/&gt;
