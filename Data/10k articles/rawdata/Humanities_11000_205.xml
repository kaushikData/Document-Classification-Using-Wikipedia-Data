      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20823">In [[linguistics]], an '''''adverbial phrase''''' ("'''AdvP'''") is a multi-word expression operating [[adverbial]]ly: its [[syntax|syntactic function]] is to modify other expressions, including [[verb]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s, [[adverbial]]s, and [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]]. Adverbial phrases can be divided into two types: [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]] adverbs versus [[Grammatical modifier|modifier]] adverbs.&lt;ref name="Pullum"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pullum|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Huddleston|first2=Rodney|title=A student's introduction to English grammar|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=9780521612883|page=124|edition=3. printing.|url=http://113.190.240.60:8080/phamquangquyen/bitstream/123456789/1151/1/A-Students-Introduction-to-English-Grammar%20%281%29.pdf|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the sentence ''She sang very well'', the expression ''very well'' is an adverbial phrase, as it modifies the verb ''sing''.&lt;ref name="Pullum" /&gt; More specifically, the adverbial phrase ''very well'' contains two adverbials, ''very'' and ''well'': while ''well'' modifies the verb to convey information about the manner of singing (for example, ''She sang well'' versus ''She sang badly''), ''very'' is a degree modifier that conveys information about the degree to which the action of singing well was accomplished (for example, ''Not only did she sing well, she sang very well'').

==Types==
The following examples illustrate some of the most common types of adverbial phrases. All adverbial phrases appear in bold; when relevant, the head of each adverbial phrase appears in square brackets.

=== Degree adverbial phrases ===

The heads of each of the following adverbial phrases are degree adverbials (written "Deg" in syntactic trees). Degree adverbials modify adjacent adverbs (that is, an adverb that is lower in the syntactic tree than the degree adverbial).&lt;ref name="Brinton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brinton|first1=Laurel|last2=Brinton|first2=Donna|title=The linguistic structure of modern English|date=2010|publisher=John Benjamins Pub. Co.|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9789027288240|pages=196–200|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Degree adverbials are commonly used in English to convey the intensity, degree, or focusing of an adjacent adverb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adverbs of degree|url=http://www.ef.com/english-resources/english-grammar/adverbs-degree/|website=Education First|accessdate=6 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, a degree adverbial is used to modify an adverb in an adverbial phrase: for example, in (1) the degree adverbial ''very'' modifies the adverb ''quickly''; in (2) the degree adverbial ''extremely'' modifies the adverb ''hard''; in (3) the degree adverbial ''really'' modifies the adverb ''well''; and in (4), the degree adverbial ''so'' modifies the adverb ''soon''.&lt;ref name="Huddleston"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huddleston|first1=Rodney|last2=Pullum|first2=Geoffrey K.|title=The Cambridge grammar of the English language|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521431460|page=574|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      (1) ''They repaired my car '''[very] quickly'''.'''''
      (2) ''He worked '''[extremely] hard''' in the game.'''''
      (3) ''She did '''[really] well''' in her race.'''''
      (4) ''Why are you leaving '''[so] soon'''?'''''

=== Modifier adverbial phrases ===

[[Grammatical modifier|Modifier]] adverbial phrases combine with a sentence, and the removal of the adverbial phrase yields a well-formed sentence. For example, in (5) the  modifier adverbial phrase ''in an hour'' can be removed, and the sentence remains well-formed (e.g., ''I'll go to bed''); in (6) the modifier AdvP ''three hours late'' can be omitted, and the sentence remains well-formed (e.g., ''We arrived''); and in (7), the modifier AdvP ''later in the day'' can be omitted, and the sentence remains well-formed (e.g. ''The situation had resolved''). Just as [[adjective phrase]]s function attributively to give additional information about an adjacent noun, the modifier adverbial phrases illustrated in (5) to (7) function as secondary predicates that give additional temporal information about the sentence.

      (5) ''I'll go to bed '''in an hour'''''.
      (6) ''We arrived '''three hours late'''''.
      (7) '''''Later in the day''''' the situation had resolved.&lt;ref name="Huddleston" /&gt;

=== Complement adverbial phrases ===

As mentioned above, complement adverbial phrases are much less common than their modifier counterparts.&lt;ref name="Huddleston" /&gt; Adverbial phrases functioning as complements usually arise when an adverb licenses a complement as a selectional requirement. Nearly all of these complements license an adjoining prepositional phrase.&lt;ref name="Huddleston" /&gt; Below are a few examples of complement adverbial phrases.

      (8) ''Purchase of State vehicles is handled '''[similarly] to all State purchases'''''.&lt;ref name="Pullum" /&gt;
      (9) ''Foreign firms in US markets are treated '''[equally] with their US counterparts'''''.&lt;ref name="Huddleston" /&gt;

=== Distinguishing adverbs, adverbial phrases, and adverbial clauses ===

The following sentences illustrate the difference between [[adverbs]], adverbial phrases, and [[adverbial clause]]s. In the first example, "soon" is an [[adverb]] (as distinct from a [[noun]] or a [[verb]]), which is a type of [[adverbial]]. In the second sentence, the modifier "in an hour" has the same syntactic function (that is, to act adverbially and modify the base of the sentence "I'll go to bed"), though it does not contain an adverb. This modifier consists of a [[Preposition and postposition|preposition]] and a [[determiner phrase]], and functions as an adverbial, thus making it an adverbial phrase. In the third example, we see a whole [[clause]] functioning as an adverbial; it is termed an [[adverbial clause]].

      (10) ''I'll go to bed '''soon'''''.
      (11) ''I'll go to bed '''in an hour'''''.
      (12) ''I'll go to bed '''when I've finished my book'''''.

== Distribution ==

Functionally, the term [[adverbial]] refers to all structures that can take the position of an adverb on a phrase structure level.&lt;ref&gt;Sobin, N. (2011) Syntactic Analysis The Basics. Malden, MA: Blackwel&lt;/ref&gt;[[Adverb]]s modify the [[syntactic category|functional categories]] that occur in a sentence and may also be treated as [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]s which are functionally open and require one or more [[argument (linguistics)|arguments]] to be satisfied.&lt;ref name=Ojea&gt;Ojea Lopez, Ana I. (1995). "The Distribution of Adverbial Phrases in English", Atlantis, 17 (1-2), p. 181-206.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been argued that the distribution of [[adverb]]s is largely conditioned by their lexical nature or [[topic-comment|thematic properties]].&lt;ref name=Ojea/&gt;

===Classes of adverbials===
Main classes of adverbials are used to distinguish the functional properties of the adverbs within the phrase. Each class has subcategories, that refer more specifically to the syntactic and semantic properties of the adverbial.There is no distinct terminology for these classes used universally in literature, though adverbials are often classified into their functional categories.&lt;ref name="Hasselgård"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hasselgård|first1=Hilde|title=Adjunct adverbials in English|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-51556-6|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major classes of adverbials are adjunct, disjunct and conjunct.&lt;ref name="Greenbaum"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greenbaum|first1=Sidney|title=Studies in English adverbial usage|date=1969|publisher=Longmans|location=London|isbn=0582524008|edition=2. impression.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Adjunct (grammar)|Adjunct]]:
#:referring to information of the action or state in the clause or aspects of things within the real world. 
#[[Conjunction (grammar)|Conjunct]]:
#:contextualizes relationships between text. Provides a connective function. 
#:(ie. furthermore, to begin with, however) 
#[[Disjunct (linguistics)|Disjunct]]:
#:conveys speakers evaluation of something
#:( ie. probably, fortunately) 
#Subjunct: 
#:has a subordinate role relative to other clauses in the structure.
#:often referring to viewpoint, focus, or degree adverbials
The class of subjunct is usually placed within adjunct class as it is difficult to distinguish between the two.&lt;ref name="Hasselgård" /&gt;

The subcategories for adverbials have more universally used terminology and often refer to the nature of the adverb within each phrase.&lt;ref name="Hasselgård" /&gt; Most literature focuses on the specific categories of adjunct adverbials.&lt;ref name="Cinque"&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Guglielmo Cinque|Cinque]]|first1=Guglielmo|title=Adverbs and Functional Heads Cross-Linguistic Perspective, A. Oxford Studies in Comparitive Syntax.|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9781280454196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ernst"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ernst|first1=Thomas|title=Syntax of Adjuncts, The. Cambridge Studies in Linguistics: 96.|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781280429439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subcategories for adverbials ===
Adjunct adverbials are the most often discussed class of adverbials, when discussing distribution in English.&lt;ref name="Ernst" /&gt; Complement adverbials are also seen to display similar attributes as adjuncts. Distinguishing between these is a matter of the overt realization of the phrase and is discussed below. The most recognizable subcategories for adjunct adverbials would be.:
# Time (answers the question 'When?')
#:''She will be arriving '''in a short time.'''''
# Place (answers the question Where?')
#:''She is waiting '''near the wall.'''''
# Manner (answers the question 'How?')
#:''They are discussing the matter '''in a civilized way.'''''
::More possible subcategories of adjunct adverbials are: degree, speaker-oriented, duration, focusing, viewpoint, and frequency.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adverb phrases - English Grammar Today - Cambridge Dictionary|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/adjective-and-adverb-phrases/adverb-phrases|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conjunct adverbials, sometimes called linking adverbials, are used to connect clauses together and surface in a clause-initial position in English.&lt;ref name="Hasselgård" /&gt;

==== Linking ====

::: On Tuesday there is a big party; '''however''', I wasn't invited.

Disjunct adverbials, also refereed to as modal adverbials, have subcategories which relay a speakers interpretation of what appears lower in the clause.

==== Evaluative ====

:::'''In my opinion''', syntax is confusing.

Subjunct adverbials are not often discussed as a class of its own in literature. As the distinction of these subcategories as subjunctive depend on the role the adverbial takes within the phrase, a subordinate role, and when not in this structure will be in the adjunct class.&lt;ref name="Hasselgård" /&gt;

=== Adjuncts vs. complements ===
Adverbials can be adjuncts, complements, conjuncts, or disjuncts. Most commonly, adverbial phrases are either complements or adjuncts. [[Adjunct (linguistics)|Adjunct]] adverbial phrases provide additional information and are part of the structure of the clause, but are optional.&lt;ref&gt;Akmajian, A. and F. Heny. 1980. An introduction to the principle of transformational syntax. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Complement (linguistics)|Complements]] are elements of an utterance that complete the meaning of the noun or sentence in which it is being used. Unlike adjuncts, they are necessary to complete the meaning of a given sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heidari|first=Maryam|date=2016|title="Complement of adverb, adverbial phrase or Prepositional phrase?"|url=|journal=Literary Arts|volume=8|pages=193–204|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adverbial complement]] is the term used to identify an adverbial phrase that is necessary to the meaning of the verb or utterance. Adverbial complements always appear after the verb that they modify. If the verb is intransitive, the complement will appear directly after the verb; if the verb is transitive, the complement will appear after the verb’s direct object.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Adverbial-Complements.htm|title=Adverbial Complements|website=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A test to identify whether or not an adverbial phrase is a complement or adjunct is to remove the phrase in question from the sentence. If the sentence no longer makes sense or if its meaning is altered heavily, then the adverbial element is a complement. If the meaning is still intact, it is an adjunct.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Adverbial fronting==

One phenomenon occurring frequently in sentences that involve adverbial phrases is adverbial fronting, where the adverbial phrase moves to the front of a sentence. 
*''I will go on the cruise next year. 
*''Next year, I will go on the cruise.

Liliane Haegeman has done considerable work on both this phenomenon, as well as comparing the movement of adverbial phrases to this syntactic position to typical movement and [[topicalization]] of arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Haegeman, L. (2003). Notes on Long Adverbial Fronting in English and the Left Periphery. Linguistic Inquiry, 34(4), 640-649. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/stable/4179254&lt;/ref&gt; Haegeman mentions that there is a difference between fronted adjuncts (in this case, adverbial phrases) and topicalized arguments. Adverbial phrases behave as adjuncts, and that serves as particularly useful in discussions regarding adverbial phrases and their movement, as well as their integration into syntactic structure.

There are three primary reasons, according to Haegeman, why topicalized arguments and fronted adjuncts differ.

1. Fronted arguments block subject extraction, while fronted adjuncts do not. 
This is displayed in the following examples, which are given in "Notes on Long Adverbial Fronting in English and the Left Periphery":

*''*"This is the man who liberty would not grant to us". 
*''"John Prescott is the person who in future will be in charge of major negotiations."

2. Topicalized arguments determine island effects on extraction, while fronted adjuncts do not. What this means is that arguments cannot be extracted from an island and thereby fronted, whereas adjuncts, in this case adverbial phrases, can be extracted and fronted.

3. English fronted arguments are restricted to root clauses, while adjuncts are not. 
In regards to main and embedded clauses, topicalization of arguments cannot occur from an embedded to a root clause. However, adjuncts are free to make this movement and are not restricted by embedded clauses.

This third distinction between topicalized arguments and fronted adjuncts lends itself well to an explanation of long and short adverb fronting. Short adverb fronting is fronting of an adjunct such as an adverb within one clause, while long adverb fronting involves movement of an adjunct from a position in the embedded clause to a position in the root clause. 

According to Haegeman, instances of long adverb fronting appear to behave like fronted arguments, adhering to the three distinctions not typically expected of adjuncts such as adverbial phrases.  This is shown, Haegeman argues, as extracted adjuncts behave similarly to topicalized arguments in that long adjunct fronting blocks subject extraction, while short adjunct fronting does not. Additionally, in long adjunct fronting, long adjunct fronting means that the constituent which moves may change the meaning of the sentence or make it ungrammatical.

*''These are the investigators who I told there were never any illegitimate appropriations of money during my time as university president. 
*''These are the investigators who, during my time as university president, I told there were never any illegitimate appropriations of money.


It has also been proposed that temporal adverbial clauses, giving "when" information about time, can be derived from wh-movement in a sentence and be fronted in a similar manner. Typically, this is movement towards the left periphery, to the left of the subject position.&lt;ref&gt;Haegeman, L. (2009). The movement analysis of temporal adverbial clauses. English Language and Linguistics, 13(3), 385-408. doi:10.1017/S1360674309990165&lt;/ref&gt;

*''When I heard this song, I thought of my first love.

Previously discussed short fronting plays a role in the movement of temporal adverbial clauses. According to Haegeman's movement approach, short movement is commonly found in this temporal adverbial movement; however, long adverbial movement is also found in regards to temporal adverbial phrases using "when".

==In French vs English==
Adverbial phrases are different across languages, especially French. Like English, adverb phrases are the parts of a sentence that add circumstantial information. French often requires using adverbial phrases where English is satisfied with a simple adverb.

For example, where English uses just one adverb, French requires a full adverbial phrase:

*'''surprisingly → de manière surprenante'''
*'''forwards → vers l'avant or en avant'''
*'''hopefully → avec un peu d'espoir'''

Placements of adverbs in adverbial phrases is usually determined by the category of adverbs. In English, placement of adverbs can sometimes be arbitrary, where some adverbs may be found in front or after the verb or even at the beginning of the sentence, while French adverbs have much stricter rules and can be difficult.&lt;ref name="French Adverbs 101"&gt;{{cite web|title=French Adverbs 101|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/introduction-to-french-adverbs-1368802|website=ThoughtCo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a French adverb modifies a verb, it is placed after the conjugated verb, example:
::Nous avons '''bien''' mangé.
::We ate '''well'''.

When an adverb modifies an adjective or another adverb, it is placed in front of the 
word it is modifying, for example:

::Je suis '''profondément''' ému.
::I am '''deeply''' moved.

There is a contrast between verb–adverbial order in French and adverbial–verb order in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rowlett|first1=Paul|title=The Syntax of French|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.385.951&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adverbial expressions are formed in French, by combining prepositions with nouns (or noun phrases), adjectives (adjective + a noun), adverbs, or a series of words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adverbial Expressions|url=https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/french/french-i/french-i-adverbs/adverbial-expressions|website=www.cliffsnotes.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While movement is slightly different from English, suffixation is similar. Most French words that end in -ment is an adverb, and the majority of the time its English equivalent ends in -ly: généralement – generally.&lt;ref name="French Adverbs 101"/&gt;
In a brief overview on how adverbs are used in the overall phrase structure, in French there is an expansion in the word due to a derivation adjective adjective-to-adverb conversion process, namely, -ment suffixation. For example:

::'''Ferme → Fermement'''
::'''Patient→ Patiemment'''

Similarly, in English, words have the -ly suffication added at the end of adverbs in adverbial phrases. For example:

::'''Firm→ Firmly'''
::'''Patient→ Patiently'''

However, this process of adding suffixation at the end of the adverbial word in French, is not as productive as -ly suffixation in English, and some adjectives are incompatible with it. For example, the adverb 'interesting' would become ungrammatical if the -ment adverb suffixation were to be added:

::'''Intéressant→ *intéressamment'''

Additionally, French adverbials are derived from adjectives in a completely irregular fashion not even using the suffix -ment:

*'''bon → bien ("good" → "well")'''
*'''mauvais → mal ("bad" → "badly")'''
*'''meilleur → mieux ("better"-adjective → "better"-adverb)'''

}}The '''W. F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research''' ('''AIAR'''), is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] research institution located in East [[Jerusalem]]. It is the oldest American research center for ancient Near Eastern studies in the Middle East.  Founded in 1900 as the ''American School of Oriental Research'', it was renamed in 1970 after its most distinguished director and the father of [[Biblical archaeology]], [[William F. Albright]].  Its mission is to develop and disseminate scholarly knowledge of the literature, history, and culture of the Near East, as well as the study of civilization from pre-history to the early Islamic period.  
Today, the Albright Institute is one of three separately incorporated institutes affiliated with the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] (ASOR), the others being the American Center of Oriental Research –ACOR- in [[Amman]], Jordan, and the Cyprus American Archaeological Research Institute –CAARI- in [[Nicosia]], Cyprus.  
In 1948, the then [[American School of Oriental Research]], also known as  the Jerusalem School, played a significant role in the discovery and identification of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] (see below). Between 1981 and 1996,  the Albright Institute, together with the Institute of Archaeology, [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], excavated at the ancient [[Philistine]] site of Tel Miqne-[[Ekron]], one of the five Philistine capital cities mentioned in the [[Bible]]. With the appointment of the new Director, Matthew J. Adams (2014), the Institute is now engaged in the Jezreel Valley Regional Project, a long-term, multi-disciplinary survey and excavation project investigating the history of human activity in the [[Jezreel Valley]] from the Paleolithic through the Ottoman period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jezreelvalleyregionalproject.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in an historic 1920s-period building, now a Jerusalem landmark, the Albright maintains residential and research facilities including a 35,000 volume library, publications offices, and archaeological laboratories.

==Fellowships==

The Institute’s unique international fellowship program fosters a culture of intellectual integrity and respect. It provides an opportunity for students and scholars from all over the world including Israelis and Palestinians to interact and exchange information and ideas in a friendly and convivial environment, which is not duplicated in any other such institution in the region. It also promotes working relationships with related institutions in Israel and the Palestinian Authority. 
	More than 3,000 persons participate in the Albright Institute’s annual wide range of programs including lectures, reports, workshops, field trips, and social events. The Institute also supports 31 ASOR-affiliated and Albright-assisted excavation, survey, and publications projects. 
	In the current academic year, the Albright awarded over $340,000 in grants, fellowships, and fees. This year’s 64 Fellows include 34 Fellows with stipends and fee awards, and 30 Associate Senior, Post-Doctoral, and Research Fellows with funding from other sources.  In the academic year 2012-13, the Institute initiated the Seymour Gitin Distinguished Professorship, which is open to internationally recognized senior scholars of all nationalities who have made significant contributions to their field of study.

==The Dead Sea Scrolls==

The Institute played a significant role in the discovery and preservation of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. The Scrolls contain approximately eight hundred separate works written between the 2nd century BCE and the 1st century CE. They include the only Jewish Bible manuscripts from that period, including a manuscript of Exodus that dates to c. 250 BCE.   Manuscripts or fragments of every book in the Hebrew Bible except the [[Book of Esther]] were unearthed, as well as many other Jewish religious texts, many previously unknown.  Most scholars believe that the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] were the property of the [[Essenes]] who lived at the site of Khirbet Qumran.  The Essenes were a Jewish sect active in the last century BCE and the first century CE, at the same time as the [[Pharisees]] and the [[Sadducees]].

In the spring of 1948, the Institute was contacted by a representative of [[Mar Samuel]], the Metropolitan (Archbishop) of the Syrian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem, who wanted to authenticate four ancient scrolls that he had recently purchased from an antiquities dealer.
One of the younger scholars in residence at the Institute at that time, [[John C. Trever]] recognized the antiquity of the manuscripts and photographed three of the four scrolls in the basement of the Albright under very adverse conditions.  Trever was the first to photograph 1QIsaiah(a), a complete scroll of the book of Isaiah dating to approximately 100 BCE.   Trever sent copies of his photographs to his mentor—famed Near Eastern scholar and former Institute director [[William F. Albright]], who sent him a telegram congratulating him on the "greatest manuscript discovery of modern times!”

In early September 1948,  [[Mar Samuel]], contacted ASOR-currently the Albright Institute-in Jerusalem and the then Director Professor  [[Ovid R. Sellers]]. Samuel showed Sellers some additional scroll fragments that he had acquired. Sellers then focused on finding the cave in which the scrolls had been found. In late 1948, nearly two years after the discovery of the scrolls, scholars had yet to locate the cave where the fragments had been found. Conducting such a search was dangerous. When the British mandate in Palestine ended on May 15, 1948, war broke out immediately, and peace would not be restored until November. The cave was finally discovered on January 28, 1949, by a UN observer, and Sellers brought his box brownie camera to take the first photos of the cave, which were soon published in Life Magazine.

In 1952, [[Roland de Vaux]], the head of the French Biblical School in Jerusalem, organized a search of the caves in the cliffs above the Dead Sea near the site of [[Qumran]].  ASOR joined this expedition, and discovered Cave 3, the cave in which the famous [[Copper Scroll]] was found.  Cave 3 was the only Qumran cave to be completely excavated by professional archaeologists.

The Albright Institute continues to play a role in Scrolls scholarship to the present day.  In the 1990s, Board Chair Joy Ungerleider established a Dorot Dead Sea Scrolls fellowship at the Albright to enable young American scholars to work on the Scroll fragments in the nearby [[Rockefeller Museum]].  One of the first holders of this fellowship was Sidnie White Crawford, Board Chair and former president of the Institute, who lived and worked at the Albright from 1989-1991 on the editions of several Deuteronomy manuscripts from Cave 4, and the Reworked Pentateuch manuscripts, also from Cave 4.  The Albright has hosted many Scrolls scholars while they pursued their research, including Eugene C. Ulrich (University of Notre Dame), Mark Smith (New York University), and Eileen Schuller (McMaster University).  In addition, former fellow and trustee Jodi Magness (University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill) has produced the seminal work on Qumran archaeology in the twenty-first century.

==The Ekron Royal Dedicatory Inscription==
{{main|Ekron inscription}}
The Albright’s excavations at Tel Miqne [[Ekron]]  is a joint project with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and was excavated from 1981 until 1996 under the direction of the Albright’s Dorot Director and Professor of Archaeology, Seymour Gitin, and Professor Trude Dothan of the Hebrew University. The excavations have  led to one of the most important archaeological discoveries in Israel in the 20th century, perhaps second only to that of the  [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].  In 1996, a significant artifact for the corpus of Biblical Archaeology was recovered, a monumental dedicatory inscription of the seventh-century king of Ekron Ikausu. The inscription not only securely identifies the site by mentioned the name Ekron, but it gives a king-list of the rulers of [[Ekron]], fathers to sons: Ya'ir, Ada, Yasid, Padi, and Ikausu, and the name of the goddess Patgayah to whom the temple is dedicated.

Both Padi and Ikausu are mentioned in the seventh century BCE Neo-Assyrian Royal Annals as Kings of Ekron, thus providing a basis for dating their reigns.  This makes the Ekron Inscription prime documentary evidence for establishing the chronology of events relating to the late biblical period, especially the history of the [[Philistines]].  The Goddess Patgayah refers to the Aegean mother goddess of Delphi, and Ikausu meaning the Achaean or the Greek may point to the Greek heritage of the Philistines or reflect contact between the [[Philistines]] and their ‘homeland’ Greece in the Archaic period of the 7th century, during which there was intensive economic and cultural exchange.

'''''Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day''''', published in 1972, is an [[American Library Association|ALA Notable Children's Book]] written by [[Judith Viorst]] and illustrated by Ray Cruz.&lt;ref name="kc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/family/alexander/|title=Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day|accessdate=December 22, 2007|publisher=[[The Kennedy Center]]|year=2007|author=[[The Kennedy Center]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221032552/http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/family/alexander/|archive-date=2007-12-21|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ajc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/shared-blogs/ajc/outdoors/entries/2007/12/20/i_resolve_to_forget_fishing_in.html|title=I resolve to forget fishing in 2007|accessdate=December 22, 2007|publisher=[[Atlanta Journal Constitution]]|year=2007|author=Scott Bernarde|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225215241/http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/shared-blogs/ajc/outdoors/entries/2007/12/20/i_resolve_to_forget_fishing_in.html|archive-date=2007-12-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also won a George G. Stone Center Recognition of Merit, a Georgia Children's Book Award, and is a [[Reading Rainbow]] book. Viorst followed this book up with two sequels, ''Alexander, Who Used to be Rich Last Sunday'' {{ISBN|978-0-689-30602-0}}, and ''Alexander, Who's Not (Do You Hear Me? I Mean It!) Going to Move'' {{ISBN|0-689-31958-4}}.

==Plot==
From the moment Alexander wakes up, things just go wrong in his way. As he gets up, the chewing gum that was in his mouth last night somehow ends up in his hair. He trips on the skateboard and drops his sweater in the sink while the water is running. He finds out that it is going to be a terrible, horrible, no good very bad day. 

At the table, his brothers Nick and Anthony find prizes in their breakfast cereal boxes at breakfast time. Nick finds a decoder ring and Anthony finds a toy car. But as for Alexander, he only has breakfast cereal. 

In the carpool on the way to school, he does not get a window seat. At school, his teacher, Mrs. Dickens, says she likes Paul’s picture of a sailboat  rather than Alexander's picture of the invisible castle (which is actually just a blank sheet of paper). At singing time, she says that Alexander sang too loud. At counting time, she says that Alexander skipped the number [[16 (number)|16]]. Then Alexander (after he forgot "16") says that no one needs the number 16 ("Who needs sixteen?"). Then at recess, Alexander's best friend, Paul says that Alexander is no longer his best friend. He says that Phillip is his first best friend and Albert is his second best friend. But Alexander is only his third. Then Alexander says that he hopes Paul sits on a tack. He also says that he hopes the next time Paul gets a double decker strawberry ice cream cone, the ice cream falls off the cone part and it lands somewhere in Australia. At [[lunch]], Phillip has two [[cupcakes]] for dessert and Albert has a [[Hershey bar]] with [[almonds]]. And for Paul, his mother let him have a [[swiss roll|jelly roll]] with [[coconut]] [[sprinkles]]. But since Alexander's mother forgot to put in dessert, there is no dessert in his lunch bag.

After school, Alexander's mother takes both Alexander and his brothers Nick and Anthony to the dentist. The dentist Dr. Fields finds a cavity only in Alexander. He tells him he has a cavity and says he will see him next week and fix it. On the way down, the elevator door closes on Alexander's foot. Anthony pushes him into a mud puddle, and when Alexander cries because of the mud Nick says he is a crybaby. Then he punches Nick in response for calling him a “cry baby”. And at last, their mother comes back with the car. She then scolds Alexander for being muddy and fighting Nick.      
        
At the shoe store, Alexander wanted blue sneakers with red stripes, but they are out of Alexander's choice, so his mother has to buy him plain white ones, which he refuses to wear. At his father's office, he makes a mess of things when he fools around with everything there (the copying machine, the books, and the telephone). He tells Alexander to not play with his phone. But Alexander calls Australia. Then, the father gets to the point where he tells the family to stop picking him up from work by saying "Please don't pick me up anymore" to Alexander.

At home, they have lima beans for dinner (which he hates), Alexander watches kissing on TV (which he also hates), his bath-time is worst (the water being too hot, getting soap in his eyes, and his marble going down the drain), but the worst of all, he is forced to wear his railroad train pajamas (which he also hates). At bedtime, his [[Mickey Mouse]] [[nightlight]] burns out, he bites his tongue, Nick takes back a [[Pillow#Types|bed pillow]] he said Alexander could keep, and the cat says he wants to sleep with Anthony (but not Alexander).

In the end, Alexander says it has been a terrible, horrible, no good very bad day for him. His mother says to him that some days are like that, even in Australia. 

A [[running gag]] throughout the book is Alexander repeating several times that he wants to move to [[Australia]] because he thinks it is better there.&lt;ref name="kc"/&gt; It ends with his mother's assurance that everybody has bad days, even those who live there.&lt;ref name="kc"/&gt; In the Australian and New Zealand versions, he wants to move to [[Timbuktu]] instead. Alexander says tomorrow things must not get any worse.

==TV adaptation==

On Saturday, January 13, 1990, the book was adapted into a 30-minute animated musical [[television special]] that was produced by [[Klasky Csupo]] and aired on [[HBO]] in the United States. 

While the special is mostly true to the book, the following differences are:
* Aside from the running gag of Alexander making references to Australia, the producers added another running gag in the special: he searches everywhere for his favorite yo-yo, a purple glow-in-the-dark one.
* Alexander has red hair instead of orange.
* Dad has no mustache and has brown hair instead of blonde.
* Mom does not have a bandana.
* Nick has blonde hair instead of brown and wears glasses.
* Anthony has brown hair instead of blonde.
* The cat, unnamed in the book, is named Timothy.
* Phillip Parker is white instead of black and does not wear glasses.
* Albert Moyo is black instead of white.
* The [[Mickey Mouse]] night light is replaced with a lamp light, due to copyright from [[Disney]].
This special features 12 more bad things for Alexander:
* He opens a drawer too far, making it land on his right foot.
* He spills cereal on the floor while searching for a free prize.
* The kids laugh when Alexander says that he is being scrunched and smushed in the car
* He falls off of the seat when the carpool stops by his school.
* His friends will not let him play [[Monkey in the Middle]].
* He sings "roll" and "Mary Lee" while his class sings "[[Row, Row, Row Your Boat]]".
* His friends tease him multiple times when he draws a picture of an invisible castle, sings his song loudly and incorrectly, skips the number 16, gets no dessert, and explains why he refuses to play ball with them after school.
* His friends close the doors on him after school.
* He was forced by the dentist, Dr. Fields, to sit still for 30 seconds for messing around with the toothpaste, dental chair, and tray.
* His brothers pretend to be in pain when Alexander hops due to the elevator door closing on his foot.
* The shoe salesman turns down his alternate choice of sneakers (green ones).
* He is forced by his father to sit out on the couch for a [[Time-out (parenting)|time-out]] for playing with the copying machine and knocking the books off his father's desk.
The special also includes 4 good things to show the audience that even a bad day can have something good in it:
* Alexander's friends ask him if he wants to play ball with them before Alexander refuses.
* Anthony and Nick make up for what they did to Alexander while waiting for their mom to pick up the car.
* Mom finds Alexander's favorite yo-yo in the closet while turning off the bedroom light.
* Before the end credits, Timothy (the cat) changes his mind and sleeps with Alexander while talking about how Mom says everybody has bad days, even in Australia.
Although mentioned, the three following bad things are not shown in the special:
* The family has lima beans for dinner.
* Alexander watching kissing on TV.
* Alexander's bath making the evening worse.
The special also included three original songs:
* "So much to do, so little time in the morning"
* "If I could be the only child"
* "I've had a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day"

Other characters in it are Audrey, Becky, and many others.

In 2004, a stage adaptation was run at the [http://bstreettheatre.org/ B Street Theatre].

A [[Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day (film)|Disney live-action film adaptation]] was released in 2014.

==Characters==
Alexander and his two older brothers, Anthony and Nick, are based on Viorst's own three sons of the same names. But the film changed Nick to Emily, replacing the brother with a sister, and adds Trevor as well.&lt;ref name="mjs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=688766|title=Grandmother learns lesson in flexibility|accessdate=December 22, 2007|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|year=2007|author=Mary-Liz Shaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531161248/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=688766|archivedate=May 31, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
The phrase "terrible, horrible, no good, very bad . . ." has become an [[Internet meme]], often used by bloggers, and sometimes by mainstream media, to criticize, or characterize setbacks for, an individual or political movement.
The phrase is also used in the Stephen King miniseries Kingdom Hospital by the orderlies Abel and Christa.

When ‘gainst my truth thou should’st my errors poise,
Scorning remembrance of our vanish’d joys&lt;/poem&gt;}}

{{Quote|text=
POLWHELE, whose genius, in the colours clear&lt;br&gt;Of poesy and philosophic art,&lt;br&gt;Traces the sweetest impulse of the heart,&lt;br&gt;Scorn, for thy Muse, the envy-sharpen'd spear,&lt;br&gt;In darkness thrown, when shielded by desert&lt;br&gt;She seeks the lyric fane.

== History and applications ==

Anticipatory governance is a concept that has been derived from terms of similar meaning, like forward engagement and forward deployment, which was a primary focus for decisions made by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuerth|first=Leon S.|date=2009-07-17|year=|title=Foresight and anticipatory governance|journal=Foresight|volume=11|issue=4|pages=15–16|doi=10.1108/14636680910982412}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, anticipatory governance has become data oriented practice which allows citizens and governments to utilize data as contributions and evidence for decision making regarding various matters within society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iftf.org/uploads/media/SR-1272_anticip_govern-1.pdf|title=Anticipatory Governance|last=Institute for the Future|first=|date=2009–2010|publisher=Institute for the Future|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Finland has a Finnish parliamentary Committee for the Future, which takes advantage of foresight to predict and evaluate the impact of developments to the country.

Since 2001, the Millennium Project has initiated a project entitled the State of the Future Index, has been using a predictive methodology to foresee the future for global countries based on historical data, variables and indicators, such as GDP, annual population, literacy rates, population, and unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millennium-project.org/millennium/SOFI.html|title=State of the Future Index|last=Gordon|first=Theodore J.|date=2015|website=|publisher=The Millennium Project|access-date=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

=== Four part system ===

Anticipatory governance is a system with four components.  They allow the system to: use a foresight, have a networked system that integrates foresight and policy procedures, receive feedback in order to improve efficiency and knowledge, and allow for flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuerth|first=Leon S.|date=2009-07-17|year=|title=Foresight and anticipatory governance|journal=Foresight|volume=11|issue=4|pages=20|doi=10.1108/14636680910982412}}&lt;/ref&gt; By allowing for feedback, anticipatory governance can detect and assess the development of future programs and policy. Feedback can be done through audits, and assessments of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuerth|first=Leon S.|date=2009-07-17|year=|title=Foresight and anticipatory governance|journal=Foresight|volume=11|issue=4|pages=23|doi=10.1108/14636680910982412}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anticipatory system must adapt to consider possibilities that result from the data and may appear to be untraditional to allow the system to be effective and depend on pragmatic data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuerth|first=Leon S.|date=2009-07-17|year=|title=Foresight and anticipatory governance|journal=Foresight|volume=11|issue=4|pages=24–25|doi=10.1108/14636680910982412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indicators ===

Anticipatory governance utilizes various techniques to assess society which can evaluate the continuous information from knowledge based technologies, such as machine learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guston|first=David H.|year=2013|title=Understanding 'anticipatory governance'|journal=Social Studies of Science|volume=44|issue=2|page=219|doi=10.1177/0306312713508669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipatory governance also takes into consideration that the concept cannot predict the future certainly, however, it can account for several possible future avenues.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quay|first=Ray|year=2010|title=Anticipatory Governance: A Tool for Climate Change|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|publication-place=Chicago|volume=76|issue=4|page=498|doi=10.1080/01944363.2010.508428}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to determine these possible avenues the following list of indicators are required: "aggregated averages, risk assessment, sensitivity analysis of factors or decisions driving the scenarios, identification of unacceptable scenarios or worst cases, and assessment of common and different impacts among the scenarios."&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Big data ===

Anticipatory governance allows the state to use collected public information in order to determine predictive practices and draw conclusions based on this data.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; Data that is gathered by governments in large volumes can be considered [[Big data]]. Governments utilize predictive analytics to examine what kinds of behaviour and events that may occur as a result of this collected of data.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; Anticipatory governance can be used by enforcement agencies in order to proactively protect the public, for instance by estimating where future crimes may occur and identifying areas of improvement for law enforcement.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;

=== Variation ===

Anticipatory governance is not always focused on finding solution, rather it can be focused on a preventative method altogether.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guston|first=David H.|date=2013|title=Understanding 'anticipatory governance'|journal=Social Studies of Science|volume=44|issue=2|pages=223–224|doi=10.1177/0306312713508669}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this methodology, anticipatory governance, can be an alternative to having the bureaucracy form specific groups to address issues, whereby, the issue can be avoided due to precise foresight.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Furthermore, anticipatory governance can also be considered a precaution, in the sense that it is a practice for preparing for the possible future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guston|first=David H.|year=2013|title=Understanding 'anticipatory governance'|journal=Social Studies of Science|volume=44|issue=2|page=226|doi=10.1177/0306312713508669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Actors ===

Anticipatory governance involves a governing body to implement its practice, such as government institutions and policies. For example, education governance utilizes policy instrumentation in order to gather data about students as a means of creating predictions to improve future education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Ben|year=2016|title=Digital education governance: data visualization, predictive analytics, and 'real-time' policy instruments|url=|journal=Journal of Education Policy|volume=31: 2|issue=2|pages=125|doi=10.1080/02680939.2015.1035758}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, anticipatory governance can also be applicable in similar instances by private companies and by smaller organizations.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; For instance, Hewlett Packard can determine which employees will leave the company and they are able to identify ways of preventing this turnover.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;

Primarily, anticipatory governance relies on data in order to derive predictive analytical evidence to support its practice, therefore, it is necessary to have an infrastructure that sustains the produced data, such as databases, coding, computational power, and algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Ben|year=2016|title=Digital education governance: data visualization, predictive analytics, and 'real-time' policy instruments|journal=Journal of Education Policy|volume=31|issue=2|pages=126|doi=10.1080/02680939.2015.1035758|url=http://dspace.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/21746/1/Williamson_JEP_2016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These infrastructures can be provided by private companies that have the resources and technologies to acquire and create them.

=== Ethics ===
There is type of ethical analysis related to anticipatory governance known as nano ethics (see [[Impact of nanotechnology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huston|first=David H.|title=Understanding 'anticipatory governance'|journal=Social Studies of Science|publication-date=2013|volume=44|issue=2|page=220|doi=10.1177/0306312713508669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this category of nano ethics anticipatory governance falls under anticipatory ethics, which originated in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hester et al.|first=Karena|year=2015|title=Anticipation Ethics and Governance (AEG): Towards a Future Care Orientation Around Nanotechnology|url=|journal=Nanoethics|volume=9|issue=2|pages=124|doi=10.1007/s11569-015-0229-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipatory ethics and governance addresses the ethical repercussions associated with technologies in their beginning stages. It assesses the risks that the technology might present and therefore can affect future decision making of such technology (see [[Predictive analytics]]).&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Anticipatory governance in the concept of predictive analytics, data, and governing can be seen as controversial because its measures can be perceived as unethical.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; The practice of anticipatory governance presents its own ethical issues concerning the affects its methods have on the individuals that are influenced by it, such as discrimination and self-fulfilling prophecies.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Anticipatory governance can also allows the secondary use of information by governments, which in some cases can impede on citizen liberties.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; Based on the information and data that is gathered by governments, they can utilize this data in unintended ways and unbeknownst to the citizen in order to practice anticipatory governance.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

Due to the fact that anticipatory governance can be considered hypothetical the certainty of the future is not definite, thus, there is a measure of doubt associated with the practice. For example, following the Great Depression, measures were taken within the United States economy to prevent a depression from ever occurring again, however, the market crash in 2008 still occurred, despite these measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuerth|first=Leon S.|date=2009-07-17|year=|title=Foresight and anticipatory governance |journal=Foresight|volume=11|issue=4|pages=28|doi=10.1108/14636680910982412}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipatory governance also supersedes information about people that may never happen in actual reality.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; By drawing conclusions based on anticipatory predictions certain groups in society face the consequences of this practice and are subject to prejudices by others within society.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; For example, predictive policing can target specific individuals within a society because the information provided by such analytics and technology, supports recidivism. Recidivism is the concept that people that have committed crimes are likely to recommit offences, thus becoming individuals of interest in predictive policing data (see [[Predictive policing]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schlehahn|first=Eva|last2=Aichroth|first2=Patrick|last3=Mann|first3=Sebastian|last4=Schreiner|first4=Rudolf|last5=Lang|first5=Ulrich|last6=Shephard|first6=Ifan D.H.|last7=Wong|first7=B.L.

Anticipatory governance raises the concern regarding the need for traditional governments. If anticipatory governance and its associated technologies, information, and data are used to govern and make decisions within nation states, it can alter the responsibilities of government.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuerth|first=Leon S.|year=2009|title=Foresight and anticipatory governance|url=|journal=Foresight|volume=11|issue=4|pages=14|doi=10.1108/14636680910982412}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, without the use of anticipatory governance the alternative is to utilize a reactive form of governance, which results in a decision making process that can take longer and lead to implications that are difficult to predict and prevent.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

'''Behaviouralism''' (or '''behavioralism''') is an approach in [[political science]] that emerged in the 1930s in the United States. It represented a sharp break from previous approaches in emphasizing an objective, quantified approach to explain and predict political behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Guy, p. 58 says, "Behaviouralism emphasized the systematic understanding of all identifiable manifestations of political behaviour. But it also meant the application of rigorous scientific and statistical methods to standardize testing and to attempt value free inquiry of the world of politics... For the behaviouralist, the role of political science is primarily to gather and analyze facts as rigorously and objectively as possible."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petro, p. 6 says, "Behavioralists generally felt that politics should be studied much in the same way hard sciences are studied."&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with the rise of the [[behavioral sciences|behavioural sciences]], modeled after the [[natural sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy p. 58 says, "The term behaviouralism was recognized as part of a larger scientific movement occurring simultaneously in ''all'' of the social sciences, now referred to as the behavioural sciences."&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviouralism claims it can explain political behaviour from an unbiased, neutral point of view.

Behaviouralism seeks to examine the behaviour, actions, and acts of individuals – rather than the characteristics of institutions such as legislatures, executives, and judiciaries  – and groups in different social settings and explain this behavior as it relates to the political system.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
From 1942 through the 1970s, behaviouralism gained support. It was David Easton who started it in the study of political systems.  It was the site of discussion between traditionalist and new emerging approaches to political science.&lt;ref&gt;Eulau, pp 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of behaviouralism is often attributed to the work of [[University of Chicago]] professor [[Charles Merriam]] who in the 1920s and 1930s, emphasized the importance of examining political behaviour of individuals and groups rather than only considering how they abide by legal or formal rules.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a political approach ==
Prior to the "behaviouralist revolution", political science being a science at all was disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, p. 763&lt;/ref&gt; Critics saw the study of politics as being primarily qualitative and normative, and claimed that it lacked a scientific method necessary to be deemed a science.&lt;ref&gt;Guy, p. 57 says, "On the basis of the philosophical approach, traditionalists prescribe normative solutions to political problems. In their view, no political inquiry into social problems can remain neutral or completely free of normative judgements or prescriptions."&lt;/ref&gt;
Behaviouralists used strict methodology and empirical research to validate their study as a [[social science]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy p 58&lt;/ref&gt; The behaviouralist approach was innovative because it changed the attitude of the purpose of inquiry. It moved toward research that was supported by verifiable facts.&lt;ref&gt;Kegley, p 48&lt;/ref&gt; During its rise in popularity in the 1960s and '70s, behaviouralism challenged the realist and liberal approaches, which the behaviouralists called "traditionalism", and other studies of political behaviour that was not based on fact.

To understand political behaviour, behaviouralism uses the following methods: sampling, interviewing, scoring and scaling and statistical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Petro, p 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviouralism studies how individuals behave in group positions realistically rather than how they should behave. For example, a study of the [[United States Congress]] might include a consideration of how members of Congress behave in their positions. The subject of interest is how Congress becomes an 'arena of actions' and the surrounding formal and informal spheres of power.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, p 15&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning of the term ==
[[David Easton]] was the first to differentiate behaviouralism from [[behaviourism]] in the 1950s (behaviourism is the term mostly associated with psychology).&lt;ref&gt;Easton (1953) p 151&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1940s, behaviourism itself was referred to as a behavioural science and later referred to as behaviourism. However, Easton sought to differentiate between the two disciplines:&lt;ref name="Berndtson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/vol/tutkimus/julkaisut/verkko/behavior.htm|title=Behavioralism: Origins of the Concept|last=Berndtson|accessdate=2009-04-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514010256/http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/vol/tutkimus/julkaisut/verkko/behavior.htm|archivedate=14 May 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Behavioralism was not a clearly defined movement for those who were thought to be behavioralists. It was more clearly definable by those who were opposed to it, because they were describing it in terms of the things within the newer trends that they found objectionable. So some would define behavioralism as an attempt to apply the methods of natural sciences to human behavior. Others would define it as an excessive emphasis upon quantification. Others as individualistic reductionism. From the inside, the practitioners were of different minds as what it was that constituted behavioralism. [...] And few of us were in agreement.&lt;ref&gt;David Easton in Baer et al. eds, 1991 p 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With this in mind, behaviouralism resisted a single definition. [[Dwight Waldo]] emphasized that behaviouralism itself is unclear, calling it "complicated" and "obscure."&lt;ref&gt;Waldo, p 58&lt;/ref&gt; Easton agreed, stating, "every man puts his own emphasis and thereby becomes his own behaviouralist" and attempts to completely define behaviouralism are fruitless.&lt;ref&gt;Easton (1962) p 9&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, behaviouralism was a political, not a scientific concept. Moreover, since behaviouralism is not a research tradition, but a political movement, definitions of behaviouralism follow what behaviouralists wanted.&lt;ref name="Berndtson" /&gt; Therefore, most introductions to the subject emphasize value-free research. This is evidenced by Easton's eight "intellectual foundation stones" of behaviouralism:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staff.jccc.net/bwright1/Introreview2.htm|title=Introduction to Political Science. Exam 2 Study guide|accessdate=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riemer, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Regularities'' - The generalization and explanation of regularities.
# ''Commitment to Verification'' - The ability to verify ones generalizations.
# ''Techniques'' - An experimental attitude toward techniques.
# ''Quantification'' - Express results as numbers where possible or meaningful.
# ''Values'' - Keeping ethical assessment and empirical explanations distinct.
# ''Systemization'' - Considering the importance of theory in research.
# ''Pure Science'' - Deferring to pure science rather than applied science.
# ''Integration'' - Integrating social sciences and value.

Subsequently, much of the behavioralist approach has been challenged by the emergence of [[postpositivism]] in political (particularly international relations) theory.

== Objectivity and value-neutrality ==
According to David Easton, behaviouralism sought to be "analytic, not substantive, general rather than particular, and explanatory rather than ethical."&lt;ref name="Riemer, p. 101"&gt;Riemer, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the theory seeks to evaluate political behaviour without "introducing any ethical evaluations."  Rodger Beehler cites this as "their insistence on distinguishing between facts and values."&lt;ref name="Beehler p 91"&gt;Beehler p 91&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The approach has come under fire from both conservatives and radicals for the purported value-neutrality. Conservatives see the distinction between values and facts as a way of undermining the possibility of [[political philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Beehler p 91"/&gt;  Neal Riemer believes behaviouralism dismisses "the task of ethical recommendation"&lt;ref name="Riemer, p. 101"/&gt; because behaviouralists believe "truth or falsity of values (democracy, equality, and freedom, etc.) cannot be established scientifically and are beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;Somit, pp 176–180&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Bay]] believed behaviouralism was a pseudopolitical science and that it did not represent "genuine" political research.&lt;ref name="Riemer, p. 51"&gt;Riemer, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Bay objected to empirical consideration taking precedence over normative and moral examination of politics.&lt;ref name="Riemer, p. 51"/&gt;

Behaviouralism initially represented a movement away from "[[naive empiricism]]", but as an approach has been criticized for "naive scientism".&lt;ref&gt;Gilman, p 116&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, radical critics believe that the separation of fact from value makes the empirical study of politics impossible.&lt;ref name="Beehler p 91"/&gt;

===Crick's critique===
British scholar [[Bernard Crick]] in ''The American Science of Politics'' (1959), attacked the behavioural approach to politics, which was dominant in the United States, but little known in Britain.  He identified and rejected six basic premises and in each case argued the traditional approach was superior to behaviouralism:
#research can discover uniformities in human behaviour,
#these uniformities could be confirmed by empirical tests and measurements,
#quantitative data was of the highest quality, and should be analyzed statistically,
#political science should be empirical and predictive, downplaying the philosophical and historical dimensions,
#value-free research was the ideal, and
#social scientists should search for a macro theory covering all the social sciences, as opposed to applied issues of practical reform.&lt;ref&gt;"Crick, Bernard," in John Ramsden, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-century British Politics'' (2002)  p 174&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1611">The '''Burlington Boys' Choir''' was founded in 1959 in [[Burlington, North Carolina]] and serves as a performing choir and a training group for boys in the Burlington area.  The choir was founded by Eva A. Wiseman (1897-1994) who was at the time director of music for the Burlington City Schools.  Wiseman modeled the choir after the [[Vienna Boys Choir]].  Since the choir's founding, hundreds of boys have been educated in sacred and classical music.  Choir members range in age from nine to fourteen years, and are chosen not only for musical ability, but also for maturity, discipline, and high academic standing.  

The choir has traveled extensively both in the US and outside the US, has toured seven times in Europe, and performed three times in the [[White House]].  In the 2001-2002 season, the choir participated in the Canterbury Children's Choir Festival, in England, and sang ''Carmina Burana'' with the [[Greensboro]] Symphony Orchestra.  

The choir is currently directed by William Allred, who has previously served as an Assistant Director of the Winston-Salem Youth Symphony from 1995-96.  Accompanist for the choir is Woodson E. Faulkner, II.

The '''Caribbean Community''' ('''CARICOM''') is an organisation of fifteen [[Caribbean]] nations and dependencies whose main objective is to promote economic integration and cooperation among its members, to ensure that the benefits of integration are equitably shared, and to coordinate foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-15757--63-63--.html |title=CARICOM countries will speak with one voice in meetings with US and Canadian leaders |accessdate=2009-04-16 |first=Oscar |last=Ramjeet |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2009-04-16 |work=Caribbean Net News |pages= |quote= }}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation was established in 1973. Its major activities involve coordinating economic policies and development planning; devising and instituting [[Projects of the Caribbean Community|special projects]] for the less-developed countries within its jurisdiction; operating as a regional single market for many of its members (Caricom Single Market); and handling regional trade disputes. The secretariat headquarters is in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], [[Guyana]]. CARICOM is an official United Nations Observer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/en/sections/member-states/intergovernmental-organizations/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Established mainly by the English-speaking parts of the Caribbean, CARICOM has become multilingual in practice with the addition of [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] [[Suriname]] on 4 July 1995 and [[Haitian Creole|Haitian Kreyòl]]- and [[French language|French]]-speaking [[Haiti]] on 2 July 2002. Furthermore, it was suggested that [[Spanish language|Spanish]] should also become a working language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/speeches/awardceremony_outstandingstudents_applewhaite.jsp?null&amp;prnf=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608032533/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/speeches/awardceremony_outstandingstudents_applewhaite.jsp?null&amp;prnf=1 |archivedate=2011-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, CARICOM announced that they were considering making French and Dutch official languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2012/pres185_12.jsp "Communiqué Issued at the Conclusion of the Thirty-Third Regular Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community, 4-6 July 2012, Gros Islet, Saint Lucia"], "Heads of Government recognized that, although English was the official language of the Community, the facility to communicate in their languages could enhance the participation of Haiti and Suriname in the integration process. They therefore requested the conduct of a study to examine the possibilities and implications, including costs, of introducing French and Dutch."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the heads of government signed a revised [[Treaty of Chaguaramas]] that cleared the way to transform the idea of a [[common market]] CARICOM into a [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy|Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy]]. Part of the revised treaty establishes and implements the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]].

==Membership==
{{See also|Member states of the Caribbean Community}}
Currently CARICOM has 15 full members, 5 associate members and 8 observers. All of the associate members are [[British overseas territories]], and it is currently not established what the role of the associate members will be. The observers are states which engage in at least one of CARICOM's technical committees. Although the group has close ties with [[Cuba]], that nation was excluded due to lack of full democratic internal political arrangement. In 2017 Cuba and the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) bloc signed the "CARICOM-Cuba Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement"&lt;ref&gt;[https://caricom.org/Document-Library/view-document/caricom-cuba-trade-and-economic-cooperation-agreement CARICOM-Cuba Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement]&lt;/ref&gt; to facilitate closer ties.

'''The Caribbean Court of Justice''' (CCJ) is based in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and was chiefly developed to act as a settlement unit for disputes on the functioning of the [[Caribbean Single Market and Economy|Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy]] (CSME), (known as "original jurisdiction"). In addition, some of the region's Commonwealth Caribbean member states of CARICOM have opted to supplement original jurisdiction with "appellate jurisdiction" which by practice replaces the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] (in London, United Kingdom) with the CCJ.

As of 2018, the majority of member states continue to utilize the Privy Council as their final appellate court and three member states do not use the CCJ for either its original jurisdiction or its appellate jurisdiction because they have either not signed the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas (the Bahamas and Haiti) or are a current United Kingdom Overseas Territory (Montserrat).  A handful of various public [[propositions]] have been held in several countries of CARICOM polling on public support for transitioning of appellate jurisdiction to the CCJ, and to-date the majority of these measures held have failed.

===Associate institutions===
The six designated associate institutions of CARICOM are as follows:

==CARICOM Standard and Song==
The flag of the Caribbean Community was chosen and approved in November 1983 at the Conference of Heads of Government Meeting in Port of Spain, Trinidad. The original design by the firm of WINART Studies in Georgetown, Guyana was substantially modified at the July 1983 Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government.&lt;ref name="CARICOM Standard"&gt;[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community/caricom_standard.jsp?menu=community CARICOM Standard]&lt;/ref&gt; The flag was first flown on 4 July 1984 in Nassau, Bahamas at the fifth Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government.&lt;ref name="CRW Flags CARICOM"&gt;[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/int-cari.html Flag of the Caribbean Community and Common Market]&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag features a blue background, but the upper part is a light blue representing sky and the lower, a darker blue representing the Caribbean Sea. The yellow circle in the centre represents the sun on which is printed in black the logo of the Caribbean Community, two interlocking Cs. The two Cs are in the form of broken links in a chain, symbolising both unity and a break with the colonial past.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The narrow ring of green around the sun represents the vegetation of the region.&lt;ref name="CARICOM Standard"/&gt;

For CARICOM's 40th anniversary, a competition to compose an official song or anthem for CARICOM was launched in April 2013&lt;ref name="History created with new CARICOM song"&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2014/pres168_14.jsp 
|title=History created as new CARICOM song is launched
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; to promote choosing a song that promoted unity and inspired CARICOM identity and pride. A regional panel of judges comprising independent experts in music was nominated by member states and the CARICOM Secretariat. Three rounds of competition condensed 63 entries to a final three, from which judges chose ''Celebrating CARICOM'' by Michele Henderson of Dominica&lt;ref name="History created with new CARICOM song"/&gt; in March 2014.&lt;ref name="Song Factsheet"/&gt; Henderson won a US$10,000 prize.&lt;ref name="Song Competition Terms of Reference"&gt;

|title=CARICOM Song Competition: Terms of Reference}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Her song was produced by her husband, Roland Delsol Jr., and arranged by Earlson Matthew. It also featured Michael Ferrol on drums and choral input from the St. Alphonsus Choir. It was re-produced for CARICOM by Carl Beaver Henderson of Trinidad and Tobago.&lt;ref name="Song Factsheet"/&gt;

A second-place entry titled ''My CARICOM'' came from Jamaican Adiel Thomas&lt;ref name="History created with new CARICOM song"/&gt; who won US$5,000,&lt;ref name="Song Competition Terms of Reference"/&gt; and a third-place song titled ''One CARICOM'' by Carmella Lawrence of St. Kitts and Nevis,&lt;ref name="History created with new CARICOM song"/&gt; won US$2,500.&lt;ref name="Song Competition Terms of Reference"/&gt; The other songs from the top-ten finalists (in no particular order) were:

* ''One Region one Caribbean'' from Anguilla,
* ''One Caribbean Family'' from Jamaica, 
* ''CARICOM’s Light'' from St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines,
* ''We Are CARICOM'' from Dominica,
* ''Together As one'' from Dominica,
* ''Blessed CARICOM'' from Jamaica,
* ''Together We Rise'' from Jamaica.&lt;ref name="Song Factsheet"&gt;[http://tropicalfete.com/word-version-of-caricom-song-competition-fact-sheet/ WORD Version of CARICOM song competition Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first official performance of ''Celebrating CARICOM'' by Henderson took place on Tuesday 1 July 2014 at the opening ceremony for the Thirty-Fifth Regional Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government in Antigua and Barbuda.&lt;ref name="History created with new CARICOM song"/&gt;

==History==
CARICOM, originally the Caribbean Community and Common Market, was established by the [[Treaty of Chaguaramas]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caricomlaw.org/doc.php?id=21 Original Treaty of Chaguaramas] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011055645/http://www.caricomlaw.org/doc.php?id=21 |date=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which took effect on 1 August 1973. The first four signatories were [[Barbados]], [[Jamaica]], [[Guyana]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].

CARICOM superseded the 1965–1972 [[Caribbean Free Trade Association]] (CARIFTA) organised to provide a continued economic linkage between the English-speaking countries of the Caribbean after the dissolution of the [[West Indies Federation]], which lasted from 3 January 1958 to 31 May 1962.

A revised Treaty of Chaguaramas established the Caribbean Community including the CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME) and was signed by the [[CARICOM Heads of Government]] of the Caribbean Community on 5 July 2001 at their Twenty-Second Meeting of the Conference in Nassau, The [[Bahamas]].&lt;ref name=revised_chaguaramas&gt;[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community/revised_treaty-text.pdf Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110061815/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community/revised_treaty-text.pdf |date=2011-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The revised treaty cleared the way to transform the idea of a [[common market]] CARICOM into the [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy|Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy]].

Haiti's membership in CARICOM remained effectively suspended from 29 February 2004 through early June 2006 following the [[2004 Haitian coup d'état]] and the removal of [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] from the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; CARICOM announced that no democratically elected government in CARICOM should have its leader deposed. The fourteen other heads of government sought to have Aristide fly from Africa to Jamaica and share his account of events with them, which infuriated the interim Haitian prime minister, [[Gérard Latortue]], who announced he would take steps to take Haiti out of CARICOM. CARICOM thus voted on suspending the participation of Haitian officials from the councils of CARICOM.&lt;ref&gt;

|accessdate=2011-03-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the presidential election of [[René Préval]], Haitian officials were readmitted and Préval himself gave the opening address at the CARICOM Council of Ministers meeting in July.

Since 2013 the CARICOM-bloc and with the Dominican Republic have been tied to the [[European Union]] via an [[Economic Partnership Agreements]] signed in 2008 known as [[CARIFORUM]].&lt;ref name="cpdcngo.org"/&gt;  The treaty grants all members of the European Union and CARIFORUM equal rights in terms of trade and investment. Under Article 234 of the agreement, the [[European Court of Justice]] handles dispute resolution between CARIFORUM and European Union states.&lt;ref name="jamaica-gleaner.com"/&gt;

Barbados hosts a large diaspora population of Guyanese, of whom (in 2005) 5,032 lived there permanently as citizens, permanent residents, immigrants (with immigrant status) and Caricom skilled nationals; 3,200 were residing in Barbados temporarily under work permits, as students, or with "reside and work" status. A further 2,000-3,000 Guyanese were estimated to be living illegally in Barbados at the time.&lt;ref name="Guyanese, British and Americans in Barbados"&gt;[http://cnewsnow.tripod.com/id376.html Guyanese, British and Americans among illegal immigrants living in Barbados]&lt;/ref&gt; Migration between Barbados and Guyana has deep roots, going back over 150 years, with the most intense period of Barbadian migration to then-British Guiana occurring between 1863 and 1886, although as late as the 1920s and 1930s Barbadians were still leaving Barbados for British Guiana.&lt;ref name="When Barbadians emigrated to Guyana"&gt;[http://www.stabroeknews.com/2011/features/in-the-diaspora/08/01/mudheads-in-barbados-a-lived-experience/ Mudheads in Barbados, a lived experience]&lt;/ref&gt;

Migration between Guyana and Suriname also goes back a number of years. An estimated 50,000 Guyanese had migrated to Suriname by 1986&lt;ref name="Ethnologue Suriname"&gt;

===Association of Caribbean States===

CARICOM was instrumental in the formation of the [[Association of Caribbean States]] (ACS) on 24 July 1994. The original idea for the Association came from a recommendation of the West Indian Commission, established in 1989 by the CARICOM heads of state and government. The Commission advocated both deepening the integration process (through the CARICOM Single Market and Economy) and widening it through a separate regional organisation encompassing all states in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Evolution of the ACS"&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.sela.org/media/268462/evolution_of_the_association_of_caribbean_states_-acs.pdf 
|title=Evolution of the Association of Caribbean States
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

CARICOM accepted the commission's recommendations and opened dialogue with other Caribbean states, the Central American states and the Latin American nations of Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico which border the Caribbean, for consultation on the proposals of the West Indian Commission.&lt;ref name="Evolution of the ACS"/&gt;

At an October 1993 summit the heads of state and government of CARICOM and the presidents of the then-[[G-3 (Latin America)|Group of Three]] (Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela) formally decided to create an association grouping all states of the Caribbean basin. A work schedule for its formation was adopted. The aim was to create the association in less than a year, an objective which was achieved with the formal creation of the ACS.&lt;ref name="Evolution of the ACS"/&gt;

===Community of Latin American and Caribbean States===

CARICOM was also involved in the formation of the [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States]] (CELAC) on 3 December 2010. The idea for CELAC originated at the [[Rio Group]]–Caribbean Community Unity Summit on 23 February 2010 in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== European Union: Economic Partnership Agreements ===

Since 2013, the CARICOM-bloc and the Dominican Republic have been tied to the [[European Union]] via an [[Economic Partnership Agreements]] known as [[CARIFORUM]] signed in 2008.&lt;ref name="cpdcngo.org"&gt;[http://www.cpdcngo.org/barbados/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=102:caribbean-moves-afoot-to-restructure-cariforum&amp;catid=3:news&amp;Itemid=57 Caribbean moves afoot to restructure CARIFORUM],  Peter Richards, Tuesday April 12th 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The treaty grants all members of the European Union and CARIFORUM equal rights in terms of trade and investment.  Within the agreement under Article 234, the [[European Court of Justice]] also carries dispute resolution mechanisms between CARIFORUM and the European Union states.&lt;ref name="jamaica-gleaner.com"&gt;[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20091008/letters/letters1.html "Letter: Privy Council and EPA"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821110351/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20091008/letters/letters1.html |date=2014-08-21 }}, October 8, 2009, ''Jamaica Gleaner''&lt;/ref&gt;

===OHADAC Project===

In May 2016, Caricom's court of original jurisdiction, the CCJ, signed a  memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the [[African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States|ACP]] Legal Association based in Guadeloupe recognizing and supporting the goals of implementing a harmonized business law framework in the Caribbean through ACP Legal Association's [[OHADAC Project]].&lt;ref name="CCJ signs MOU on OHADAC"&gt;[http://today.caricom.org/2016/05/20/ccj-signs-mou-on-harmonising-business-law-in-caribbean/ CCJ signs MOU on harmonising business law in Caribbean]&lt;/ref&gt;

OHADAC is the acronym for the French "Organisation pour l'Harmonisation du Droit des Affaires en les Caraïbes", which translates into English as "Organisation for the Harmonization of Business Law in the Caribbean". The OHADAC Project takes inspiration from a [[OHADA|similar organisation in Africa]] and aims to enhance economic integration across the entire Caribbean and facilitate increased trade and international investment through unified laws and alternative dispute resolution methods.&lt;ref name="CCJ signs MOU on OHADAC"/&gt;

The '''Comandos Autónomos Anticapitalistas''' ('''CAA''' or '''CCAA''') ({{lang-eu|Komando Autonomo Antikapitalistak}}; "Autonomous Anticapitalist Commandos") were a [[Basque people|Basque]] armed group in Spain with [[Autonomism|Autonomist Marxist]] politics, defined as an [[anarchism|anarchistic]] breakaway of [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]].

The group was very active in the 1970s and 1980s. The most important attack was the assassination of [[Spanish Socialist Workers Party]] [[Senate of Spain|Senator]] [[Enrique Casas]] in 1984, which was rejected by all the political spectrum including ETA, which at the time, rejected violence against politicians.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
Soon after, one of the few operating CAA commandos was ambushed by the [[Guardia Civil]] at the bay of [[Pasaia]], killing four – all but one.

The ambush at Pasaia is dealt with in a documentary film called "Pasaiako Badia". [[Pasaiako Badia]] In this film, witnesses, relatives and others recount the arrest of Rosa Jimeno by the Spanish police, her torture and the trap set for the CAA, which included Rosa being tied up and a rendezvous with the members of CAA arranged. She was forced to set a date with CAA members near the harbor at Pasaia in March 1984.  Once the CAA members arrived in the harbor the armed police, shot Pelu and Pelitxo, killing both, and arrested two, ‘Txapas' and ‘Kurro', who were tortured and killed. Joseba Merino&lt;ref name="undefined" /&gt; and Rosa survived. The G.A.L. a paramilitary group including former francoist officers which used public funds and participated in the Spanish state's war on terrorism was allegedly involved in the ambush.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10676">Juvenile law pertains to those who are deemed to be below the [[age of majority]], which varies by country and culture. Usually, minors are treated differently under the law. However, even minors may be prosecuted as adults.

== Summary ==
In both [[France]] and the [[United States]], some actions are prohibited to minors, such as the underage consumption of alcohol or tobacco, truancy, running away from home, and ungovernability. A minor can thus become a [[status offender]].

===United States===
In the United States, the juvenile varies in definition from state to state. The system applies to anyone between the ages of 6 to 10, depending on the state, and 18;&lt;ref&gt;[[American juvenile justice system]]&lt;/ref&gt; except for 11 states (including Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, South Carolina, and Texas), where a juvenile is a person under 17 and New York and North Carolina, where it is under 15.&lt;ref&gt;[[juvenile law]]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, criminal majority begins at 16, 17, or 18.

The federal Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Act of 1974 set up four key requirements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncpa.org/ba/ba235.html The federal ''Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Act''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130182242/http://www.ncpa.org/ba/ba235.html |date=2006-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for US minors:
* Firstly, the deinstitutionalization of status offenders, moving them from juvenile hall to community-based or family-based environments.
* Secondly, segregation (sight and sound separation) between juvenile and adult offenders
* Thirdly,  strong limitation for the juvenile justice system to put juveniles in adult jails.
*Fourthly, the protection of minority groups from being overrepresented in high-security facilities.

All states participate except South Dakota and Wyoming.

===France===
France has three stages of minors:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://fr.jurispedia.org/index.php/Minorité_pénale_%28fr%29 Jurispedia, Minorité pénale]'' in French&lt;/ref&gt;
* The infant, still without a perception of acts yet, commits no offence and so cannot be convicted.
* A minor between 7/8 and 13 has his own discernment. No criminal punishment but only educative measures can be pronounced against him, according to a 2002 law.
* A minor between 13 and 18 who commits an offence can have punishment that is educational or, in special cases, criminal.

The criminal irresponsibility of children under 13 is defined by the Article 122-8 of the Criminal Code. Those between 13 and 18 are assumed to be irresponsible, but they can be involved in a criminal sentence if the circumstances and the juvenile's delinquent personality justify.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.senat.fr/lc/lc52/lc525.html Sénat]'' in French&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
According to Jean Pierre Rosenczveig, a children's judge in [[Bobigny]], near [[Paris]], the juvenile criminal law in France has six key requirements:&lt;ref&gt;Rosenczveig, Jean Pierre; ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011342/http://www.rosenczveig.com/Nanterre/Fac2%20-%202006-2007.pdf Droit pénal des mineurs, étude de]''&lt;/ref&gt;
# The specialization of the magistrate. Indeed, the juvenile criminal system has its own intervener: the children's judge, the court of assizes of minors, the court of appeal chamber of minors etc.
# Criminal relative responsibility begins at the age of 13.
# The priority is to educate, rather than punish. Article 2 of the order of February 2, 1945 imposes an educative-placing proposal to minors to whom a detention placing measure is considered.
# Parents have to be informed of their child's police custody. Moreover, Article 13 of the same order imposes an examination of the parents before the decision of the tribunal. Also, before the juvenile's police custody, the service for the legal protection of youth must be called.
# Requirement of an attorney for the juvenile. If he does not contact one, the jurisdiction has to do it for him.

In the US, the presence of an attorney is only recommended, not compulsory.

In most states, special courts try juveniles, but some like Colorado do not have them. Some crimes allow juvenile delinquents to be tried by the superior court (such as first-degree murderer or gang murder).

Juveniles also have special protections, in addition of juvenile courts, which are closed to the public in the US. In France, closing the court to the public (''huis clos'') is an option.  Just like in France, US parents or guardians have to be informed and to be present during the police questioning. At least, the names of juveniles are kept confidential when they are accused of a crime. Juvenile cases are heard by not a jury but a judge.

At least, the US criminal law system has a particular vocabulary for juveniles' cases. Indeed, juvenile offenders commit not a crime but a delinquent act. Also, courts use the term delinquent or not delinquent, instead of guilty or not guilty, just to show that a minor is different from a criminal.

Juveniles have the same rights as adults. They are assumed innocent, they are noticed of charges advance of any adjudication of delinquency, they have the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, and they have the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

After their arrest, in both countries, minors may be placed in provisory detention (until a [[European Convention on Human Rights]] case banned it in France) if the parents are prejudiced and informed. Provisory detention is done in a juvenile hall, separated from adults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0701/ijdf/frjacsdb.htm US Info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713074258/http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0701/ijdf/frjacsdb.htm |date=2007-07-13 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

US parents may be liable for the acts of their child if they failed their parent’s authority, an example being if the minor is involved in a gang offense. Also, juveniles have no right to bail.

As can be noted, UD and French procedures are not that different as they have a common goal: to protect, as much as possible, the interest of the minor offender. Nevertheless, except for detention (the separation from adults as well as parents' awareness), the priorities are different. The US prefers the confidentiality of minors, but France stresses accommodating the juvenile within the criminal system.

Both systems protect but not in the same way. In France, an attorney is compulsory. In the US, there is no jury.

As notef, the goal of the juvenile justice in France and the US is clearly to educate child offenders, rather than punish them, even if some measures can be severe.

== Sanctions incurred by minors ==
The order of February 2, 1945 relative to the childhood delinquency contains three measures to punish French minor offenders:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.senat.fr/lc/lc52/lc525.html Sénat]'' in French&lt;/ref&gt;
* Firstly, the educational measure can be an admonition, a particular educational placing, under legal protection (up to five years) or a supervised freedom.
* Secondly, the mediation-retrieval measure in which the minor is involved in the reparation of the damage he caused. The victim must approve. A minor between 16 and 18 may be submitted to a general interest working.
* Thirdly, the imprisonment measure that may not exceed half of the adult imprisonment term. However, oldest minors (over 16) may have the same penalty as adults if the offence is serious.

The punishment depends of minor's age. As aforesaid, if he is under 7 or 8, he can have no punishment. If he is between 8 and 13, the sentence is nothing more than an educational punishment. If he is over 13, he can have both an educational and a criminal punishment, but the tribunal has to explain its decision according to the minor's personality and the circumstances.

The US is less divided. The penalry is equal for each juvenile offender over 10, and there is no stage differentiation between measures. However, the measures&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoline.org/InformationLibrary/Documents/Juvenile%20Sanctions%20fj.asp Juvenile Sanctions, Info Online]&lt;/ref&gt; themsrlves are quite the same:
* Placing the delinquent in the care of an institution to take care of him
* Placing the delinquent in an alternative incarceration program
* Ordering the delinquent to participate in a treatment program
* Ordering the child to work in public buildings or private property
* Ordering the child to take part to the reparation of the damage he caused
* Committing the delinquent to the Department of Children and Families if his family is not adequate.

Since 1988, the death penalty for children who committed crimes has been outlawed. Also, in March 2005, the death penalty was outlawed for killers who committed their crimes before the age of 18. There were 72 peoples in [[death row]] concerned at the time.

As can be seen, the US and the French systems protect juvenile differently, but both protect effectively. There is also much stress on the prevention of delinquency in both countries.

There are several incidents involving '''controversial caricatures in the press media'''.

==International stories==
===Muhammed cartoons and response===
*The [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]], involving unflattering depictions of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] first published in [[Denmark]] in September 2005 and subsequently in other countries, lead to wide-scale protesting and rioting.

===The Arab world===
Many Muslim Middle Eastern newspapers have frequently published cartoons with allegedly [[anti-Semitic]] themes, or those created or inspired by [[Nazism|Nazi]]-style propaganda. These newspapers have generally claimed to be anti-Israeli but not anti-Jewish. Some examples:{{cn|date=April 2012}} 
*On June 6, 2002, Akhbar al-Khalij from Bahrain published a cartoon showing an Israeli Jew piercing a baby with a spear.
*On July 24, 2002 Al Watan from Qatar published a cartoon of [[Ariel Sharon]], the then [[Prime Minister of Israel]], drinking from a cup of Palestinian children's blood. 
*On December 17, 2001, Keyhan published a cartoon showing a Jewish Israeli Soldier in front of a Holocaust scenery, killing Arabs. 
*Almost all Israeli prime ministers in the last 15 years (Shamir, Peres, Rabin, Barak, Sharon) have been depicted as Nazis. Israeli Jews have been depicted as spiders,&lt;ref&gt;(Palestinian Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, Oct. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; octopuses,&lt;ref&gt;(Palestinian Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, April 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; scorpions,&lt;ref&gt;(Saudi Arabia, Al-Riyadh, Dec. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; snakes,&lt;ref&gt;Syria, Tishrin, April 30, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; thieves or other menacing-looking persons with exaggerated "Jewish" characteristics.  
*On May 17, 2001 the Palestinian Al Quds published a cartoon depicting then [[Prime Minister of Israel]], [[Ariel Sharon]], eating Palestinian children.

===Canada===
*On March 2, 2006, the Student newspaper [[the Sheaf]] from the [[University of Saskatchewan]], published a cartoon entitled "[[Capitalist Piglet]]" which featured [[Jesus]] performing a sexual act with a [[Pig]] (which was intended to represent [[Capitalism]]). The Cartoon was published in the wake of the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]], and the paper apologised for the incident four days later, and the editor resigned the following day.{{cn|date=April 2012}}

===France===

The text below it says: "History has a strange way of repeating itself!"{{cn|date=April 2012}}

===Indonesia===
On 27 March 2006, Indonesian daily [[Rakyat Merdeka]] [[West Papuan refugee crisis#Cartoons|published a cartoon]] on its front page depicting the Australian Prime Minister and Foreign minister as dingoes discussing the acquisition of the Indonesian province of [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]]. ''[[The Australian]]'' responded on 1 April with a [[Bill Leak]] cartoon depicting the Indonesian President as a dog copulating with a West Papuan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/cartoon-anger-fears/2006/04/01/1143441378824.html|newspaper=The Age|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=2 April 2006|first1=Tom|last1=Hyland|first2=Penelope|last2=Debelle|title=Cartoon anger fears|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002111754/http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/cartoon-anger-fears/2006/04/01/1143441378824.html|archivedate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
*In the [[Iran newspaper cockroach cartoon controversy]], on 23 May 2006, the Iranian government suspended publication of a state-owned newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5008420.stm Iranian paper banned over cartoon] BBC. 11;41 UC 23/05/2006 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
*Mexican cartoonists enjoy a broad freedom of speech, which has allowed the publication of cartoons which are ''normal'' in Mexico, but quite controversial in the American point of view. For example, two days after the [[September 11 attacks]], [[La Jornada]] newspaper published a cartoon where ''El Fisgon'' makes a comparison between the attacks and the multiple US military operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RJw4s5GzrD8C&amp;q=Jornada+%2213+september%22+#v=onepage&amp;q=Jornada%20%2213%20september%22&amp;f=false |title=And why? |author=El Fisgon |publisher=La Jornada}}&lt;/ref&gt; La Jornada also published in September 2001 another cartoon where ''Magu'' states that: "As the world (global) policemen of the new millennium, the Americans are using torture techniques invented by the Mexican police in the last century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RJw4s5GzrD8C&amp;q=Magu+Jornada#v=onepage&amp;q=Magu%20Jornada&amp;f=false |title=Security Reasons |author=Magu |publisher=La Jornada}}&lt;/ref&gt; The freedom of speech extends to other Mexican newspapers. [[El Universal (Mexico City)]] published several cartoons where ''Boligan'' criticizes American military operations in Iraq,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RJw4s5GzrD8C&amp;q=sorpresa+universal#v=onepage&amp;q=sorpresa%20universal&amp;f=false |title=Oh, Surprise |author=Boligan |publisher=El Universal}}&lt;/ref&gt; specially presenting a pair of soldiers as vultures who complain about the Mexican illegal immigration to the US, when at the same time they are invading Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RJw4s5GzrD8C&amp;q=ilegales+universal#v=onepage&amp;q=ilegales%20universal&amp;f=false |title=Illegals |author=Boligan |publisher=El Universal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===United Kingdom===
*On January 27, 2003, the day before Israeli elections, British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' published a cartoon&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031226013529/http://homepage.mac.com/cfj/.Pictures/independent-sharon-toon.jpg |date=December 26, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; depicting the Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon naked (with an Election badge acting as a Fig-leaf) sitting among bombed houses eating a baby while helicopters and tanks buzzed 'Vote Sharon', with Sharon saying "What's wrong, haven't you seen a politician kissing babies before". The cartoon was based on [[Goya]]'s [[Saturn Devouring His Son]] and was penned after a pre-election raid by Israeli missiles on [[Gaza City]]. The cartoon was eventually selected as the "Cartoon of the Year" by the United Kingdom's Political Cartoon Society. The Israeli embassy, backed by the Sharon government, issued a complaint saying the cartoon was [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]], however the Press Watchdog, the [[press complaints commission]], said of the cartoon; "There is nothing inherently anti-semitic about the Goya image or about the myth of Saturn devouring his children, which has been used previously to satirise other politicians accused of sacrificing their own 'children' for political purposes".{{cn|date=April 2012}}

===United States===
*[[Blackface|Racist caricatures]] of [[African American]]s have also appeared in the United States before the [[Civil Rights Movement]], and occasionally since then as well. 
*During [[World War II]], several American newspapers and major animated studios put out cartoons and films depicting the Japanese with exaggerated Asian features and as being untrustworthy or trickster figures, echoing the anti-Japanese racist sentiments common during the war period. 
*A cartoon in ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', published in October 2000, shows a Jew and a Muslim, praying at a wall where the stones are formed to read "Hate". Below the cartoon the inscription says "Worshiping their God". According to the cartoonist, it showed "BOTH Israelis AND Palestinians worshipping 'hate.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/outrage/hate.htm Barbara and David Mikkelson. "Hate" [[Snopes]]; November 28, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jesus Dress Up]] is a game that was created by artist [[Normal Bob Smith]] in 1991 as a black-and-white colorform, which he photocopied and distributed to friends.

'''Densa''' was originally a fictional association created in [[parody]] of [[Mensa International]]. Rather than belonging to the smartest 2% of the population (the criteria for membership eligibility for Mensa), members of Densa must be in the stupidest 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Boxer | first = Sarah | title = What's the Opposite of a Tree? Ask the Testers at Mensa's Gate. | pages = B13 | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1999-11-13 | quote = There is a special club for those who don't make it into Mensa, the high IQ society. It is called Densa (really). }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Queenan | first = Joe | title = You Wanna Be a Wacko, You Gotta Pay the Dues. | pages = 1 | publisher = [[The Wall Street Journal]] (Eastern edition) | date = 1989-03-28 | quote = Says Densa is one of many groups who are "the wacko patrol: the daffy, satirical organizations that never fail to tickle our funny bone with their zany antics." }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ward | first = Bruce | title = At Last: Mensa for Dummies | publisher = [[The Ottawa Citizen]] | date = 1999-05-17 }} Available on [[Lexis-Nexis]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Fisher | first = Sophie | title = Think You're Dumb?

There is no single formal Densa organisation; instead, various projects using that name exist as informal groups, usually meant by their founders as a joke rather than a serious organisation. Even within [[Mensa International|Mensa]] itself, a SIG (special interest group, an informal sub-group of Mensans sharing a particular common interest) has existed for Densa; which, like all Mensa SIGs, required Mensa membership for admission, while it was active.

The concept of an organization for the mentally dense originated in ''Boston &amp; Outskirts Mensa Bulletin (BOMB)'', August, 1974, in "A-Bomb-inable Puzzle II" by John D. Coons. The puzzle involved "The Boston chapter of Densa, the low IQ society". Subsequent issues had additional puzzles with gags about the group, and were widely reprinted by the bulletins of other Mensa groups, before the concept of a low [[IQ]] group gained wider circulation in the 1970s, with other people creating quizzes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Amyx | first = Meredy | editor-first = TJ |editor-last=Lundeen | title = The Origin of Densa | publisher = Interloc, a publication of American Mensa, Ltd. | date = June–July 2005 | url = http://www.metaphoricaldwelling.com/MetaDwelSite/Rants/index.html#densatag | accessdate = 2007-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A humor book called ''The Densa Quiz: The Official &amp; Complete Dq Test of the International Densa Society'' was written in 1983 by  Stephen Price and J. Webster Shields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Price | first = Stephen | first2 = J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7963">'''Dual power''' is a concept in the theory and practice of [[Leftism|leftist]] politics, proposed in different forms by communists and anarchists. The communist conception of dual power, advanced by Vladimir Lenin to describe the [[Dual power (Russian Revolution)|division of power during the Russian Revolution]], described the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] of workers and soldiers as an incipient state whose task was to remove and replace the formal government.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, Vladimir Ilyich. “The Dual Power.” Translated by Isaacs Bernard. Pravda, April 9, 1917. Lenin Internet Archive 1999 (2005). https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/apr/09.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; This notion has informed the strategies of subsequent [[communist]]-led revolutions, including the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] led by [[Mao Zedong|Mao]].

The anarchist conception envisions the steady creation of mechanisms of self-management separate from the state apparatus. This strategy aims to create a libertarian socialist economy and polity by means of incrementally establishing and then networking institutions of direct [[participatory democracy]] to contest the existing power structures of [[state-capitalism]]. Dual power strategy was advocated by anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in 1851: "Beneath the governmental machinery, in the shadow of political institutions, out of the sight of statemen and priests, society is producing its own organism, slowly and silently; and constructing a new order, the expression of its vitality and autonomy."&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, ''General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century.'' Translated by John Beverly Robinson. New York: Haskell House Publishers, Ltd., 1923, 1969 [1851]. p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; For some anarchists and libertarian socialists, this does not necessarily mean disengagement with existing institutions; for example, Yates McKee describes a dual power approach as "forging alliances and supporting demands on existing institutions — elected officials, public agencies, universities, workplaces, banks, corporations, museums — while at the same time developing self-organized counter-institutions."&lt;ref name='Yates'&gt;[http://www.wagingnonviolence.org/feature/art-after-occupy/ Yates McKee, "Art after Occupy — climate justice, BDS and beyond," July 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the strategy itself is sometimes also referred to as "'''counterpower'''" to differentiate it from the term's Leninist origins.

== Dual power and the Zapatista movement ==
[[File:Escuela Primaria Rebelde Autonoma Zapatista.jpg|thumb|right|Mural on the side of a "Zapatista Rebel Autonomous Primary School." The figure holds a book stating, "Autonomous education constructs different worlds into which many worlds can fit." Zapatista autonomous municipalities and their education and health systems have been described as exemplars of anarchist dual power.]]
With the growth of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista movement]], the system of local governance has been elaborated somewhat. Among the officials selected from each assembly, there are now commissioners for health and education, as well as a representative to a Clandestine Revolutionary Indigenous Committee (CCRI). The commissioners meet and coordinate with their peers on a regional basis, while there are four CCRIs, one for each language group in the area. The EZLN is subordinate to their decisions. This has fostered cooperation between community members and the EZLN, since "when a decision is made by the CCRI, it’s a decision based on consensus. It’s based on the agreement of dozens of families."&lt;ref&gt;"Conversations with Cecilia Rodriguez," ''Dark Night field notes'', no. 8 (winter/spring 1997), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

This local democracy has been extended by the creation of [[Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities]], systems of alternative institutions that effectively replace local structures of power. On February 3, 1994, Manuel Camacho Solís, the conciliator between the government and the Zapatistas, announced the creation of two free zones in which the International Red Cross would operate and the militaries would not, unwittingly providing the Zapatista communities with a bit of national territory. On December 19, 1995, the EZLN broke the Mexican Federal Army’s encirclement and carried out the political and military seizure of dozens of towns, demonstrating that its influence went far beyond the small existing conflict zone. In this expanded area, Zapatista communities formed 38 autonomous municipalities covering more than a third of the state of Chiapas.&lt;ref&gt;John Ross, ''Rebellion from the Roots: Indian Uprising in Chiapas'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Autonomous municipalities are the Zapatistas’ implementation of the 16 February 1996 San Andrés Accords, which the government abandoned in December 1996, after refusing to carry them out. The Accords guarantee the right of indigenous peoples to form and govern traditionally their own municipalities. In forming the municipalities, residents derecognize the official authorities and elect their own. They refuse federal government involvement and control. They name their "local health promoters [and] indigenous parliaments, and elaborate their own laws based on social, economic, political and gender equality among the inhabitants of diverse ethnic communities."  Councils are constituted to plan the various areas of community action and are joined by councils of elders and, increasingly, of women. These communities are accomplishing long-ignored aspirations, like building bilingual (Spanish and the local indigenous language) education systems, and providing to all what once was only provided in accordance with political patronage. A report from the Diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas finds: "At a local level municipal presidents imposed by the PRI are left governing only themselves, without being able to penetrate into the communities. Basically this means the slow destruction of…false democracy…and its replacement by communities and organizations that construct their own history first as autonomous municipalities and eventually as autonomous zones."&lt;ref&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/mexico/comment/auto_munc.html Mariana Mora, "The EZLN and Indigenous Autonomous Municipalities," April 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
This eroding of the status quo has proceeded despite the attacks by the Mexican Federal Army and their paramilitary allies, providing a dramatic demonstration of the effectiveness of grassroots dual power. Whatever its accomplishments, the EZLN sees itself as a temporary formation: A "mirror image of the Mexican Army," it is "entirely unqualified to replace it" since it includes the hierarchy and violence that it would remove from society altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Cleaver, "The Zapatistas and International Networks of Struggles," Dark Night field notes, no. 12/13, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; It will remain only "until the armed struggle becomes an absurdity and an obstacle for the revolutionary transformation of our country."&lt;ref&gt;EZLN, CCRI-GC and Subcommandante Marcos, communique to the Founding Congress of the FZLN, 13 September 1997. Quoted in Joshua Paulson, "The Zapatista March and the FZLN Congress," 8–20 September 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Icelandic name|''Eiríkr''|male}}

'''Eiríkr''' or '''Eiríkur Magnússon''' (1 February 1833 – 24 January 1913) was an [[Iceland]]ic scholar who was Librarian at the [[University of Cambridge]], taught [[Old Norse]] to [[William Morris]], translated numerous Icelandic sagas into English in collaboration with him, and played an important role in the movement to study the history and literature of the [[Norsemen]] in Victorian England.

==Biography==
Born in Berufjörður in the east of Iceland, Eiríkr was sent to England in 1862 by the Icelandic Bible Society,{{sfn|Litzenberg|1947|p=15}} and his first translations there were of mediaeval Christian texts.{{sfn|Wawn|2000|p=12}}

In 1871, with the assistance of [[Sir Henry Holland, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Holland]] and of [[Alexander Beresford Hope|Alexander Beresford-Hope]], MP for Cambridge, he became a librarian at the University of Cambridge,{{sfn|Wawn|2000|p= 57}}{{sfn|Wawn|1990|pp= 213-52; p. 234}} where he worked until the end of 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = University Intelligence | journal = The Times| date = 13 July 1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Report of the Library Syndicate| publisher = Cambridge University Library |date = 5 Mar 1913 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893 he also became lecturer in Icelandic.{{sfn|Einarsson|1933|p=194}}

Eiríkr lectured and organised famine relief for Iceland in 1875 and 1882{{sfn|Wawn|2000|pp= 11–12, 356}}{{sfn|Harris|1978|pp=31-41; pp. 32-33 }} and fell out with [[Guðbrandur Vigfússon]], a fellow Icelandic scholar who was at Oxford and had been his friend, over that{{sfn|Wawn|1990|p= 233}}{{sfn|Harris|1978|loc=pp. 38-39: Guðbrandur was not alone in doubting the famine was as bad as the Mansion House Committee had advertised, and published in ''The Times'' on 13 October 1882 arguing that "They are teaching my countrymen to beg and to play the pauper".}} and his preference for modernised Icelandic in translating the Bible; Guðbrandur was a purist.{{sfn|Wawn|2000|loc= p.356 ; Eiríkr wrote ''Mr. Vigfusson and the Distress in Iceland'' (1882) and ''Dr. Gudbrand Vigfusson's Ideal of an Icelandic New Testament Translation, or The Gospel of St. Matthew by Lawman Odd Gottskalksson'' (1879).}}

Like many Icelandic scholars in Britain at the time, Eiríkr gave Icelandic lessons as a source of income; his first pupil was probably [[Sir Edmund Walker Head, 8th Baronet|Sir Edmund Head]] in 1863, and he taught some by post.{{sfn|Wawn|2000|pp=358–59}} Another was George E.J. Powell, who had supported him financially when he first came to England and with whom he translated [[Jón Árnason (author)|Jón Arnason]]'s Icelandic folktales and worked on a translation of ''[[Hávarðar saga Ísfirðings]]'' that remained unpublished.{{sfn|Wawn|2000|p=361}}

Most famously, he taught William Morris and collaborated with him on translating a number of sagas. Within a year of Morris beginning his studies with Eiríkr, their ''Story of Grettir the Strong'' was published (1869). In 1870 they published the first English translation of ''[[Völsungasaga]]''. In 1871 Eiríkr and his wife accompanied Morris to Iceland, where Eiríkr went with Morris on a tour of "saga steads" and other places of interest.&lt;ref name="VP"&gt;{{citation| first = Richard L.|last =  Harris | jstor = 40001839 | title = William Morris, Eiríkur Magnússon, and Iceland: A Survey of Correspondence | journal = Victorian Poetry | volume =13| number = 3/4 | year = 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1891 and 1905 they published a six-volume Saga Library, which included ''[[Heimskringla]]'' and the first English translations of ''[[Hávarðar saga Ísfirðings]]'', ''[[Hænsa-Þóris saga]]'' and ''[[Eyrbyggja Saga]]''.{{sfn|Litzenberg|1947|p=13}}{{sfn|Wawn|2000|p=259}} Eiríkr defended Morris against [[Frederick York Powell|York Powell]]'s criticism of his archaic style.{{sfn|Wawn|2000|p=260; note 71}} Volume 6 of the Saga Library, volume 4 of the ''Heimskringla'', is an index that is entirely Eiríkr's work, published in 1905 after Morris's death.{{sfn|Litzenberg|1947|loc= p.9, note 19 : calls it "tremendous . . . It demonstrates Magnússon's erudition as completely as anything he wrote or translated"}}

Eiríkr was married to Sigríður Einarsdóttir,{{sfn|Einarsson|1933|p=12}} a descendant of [[Egill Skallagrímsson]].{{sfn|Wawn|2000|p=366}}  She campaigned to improve education for girls in Iceland.

He is buried in the [[Mill Road Cemetery, Cambridge|Mill Road cemetery]], Cambridge.

'''El Temblor''' is an archaeological site in [[Petén Department]], [[Guatemala]] which was once the location of a settlement of the [[Maya civilization]]. First recorded in 1974 by Ian Graham of [[Harvard University]]'s [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]], the little-known site represents a medium-sized and compact settlement about {{convert|18|km}} south-south-east of the ruined Mayan city of [[Tikal]] and about {{convert|13|km}} north-east of the ruins of [[Ixlu]]. It is situated in a wooded area called Paso del Carmen, a few kilometers east of the modern village of {{Interlanguage link multi|El Caoba|es|3=El Caoba (caserío)}}.&lt;ref name="Mayer"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Mexicon: Aktuelle Informationen und Studien zu Mesoamerika|volume=XX|date=December 1998|issue=6|title=The Maya ruins of El Temblor, Peten|last=Mayer|first=Karl H.|pages=116&amp;ndash;117|url=https://www.academia.edu/5239095/The_Maya_Ruins_of_El_Temblor_Peten}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is designated TMB in the ''Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.peabody.harvard.edu/files/cmhi/CMHI_SiteCodes_FINAL_2016.pdf|title=Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions Site Codes|last1=Graham|first1=Ian|last2=Mathews|first2=Peter|publisher=Peabody Museum|date=February 2016|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The ruins at El Temblor consist of at least three groups of collapsed structures or platforms on a north-south axis. The northernmost group, designated as Group A, is clustered in a wooded hilltop and includes a pyramid standing over {{convert|10|m}} high. A long structure similar to a palace, at least {{convert|5|m}} in length, is situated to its north-east. A damaged [[stela]] stands east of the pyramid.&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt;

Group B is located in a lower and flatter area to the south and includes at least five mounds or platforms. Group C is located further south along the site's main axis and comprises eight structures on a hill, possibly representing temples and palaces. A [[chultun]], a bottle-shaped underground storage chamber, is situated to the west of Group C.&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt;

The site is unguarded and has been badly damaged by [[Archaeological looting|looters]] who have dug trenches and mutilated stelae.&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt; Around 1970, two sawn-off inscribed sides from an El Temblor stela were offered for sale by a [[New York City]] art gallery which claimed it to be of unknown provenance, presumed to be from [[Belize]]. One side was purchased by the [[Nasher Museum of Art]] at [[Duke University]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. The other side was purchased privately and its whereabouts are unknown.&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt;

El Temblor has not yet been investigated archaeologically. However, its visible architectural features suggest that it dates from the Late Classic period (circa AD 600–909).&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt;

{{See also|Baroque painting}}

'''Flemish Baroque painting''' refers to the art produced in the [[Southern Netherlands]] during Spanish control in the 16th and 17th centuries. The period roughly begins when the [[Dutch Republic]] was split from the [[Habsburg Spain]] regions to the south with the Spanish recapturing of [[Antwerp]] in 1585 and goes until about 1700, when Habsburg authority ended with the death of [[Charles II of Spain|King Charles II]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe1"&gt;Vleighe, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Antwerp, home to the prominent artists [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Anthony van Dyck]], and [[Jacob Jordaens]], was the artistic nexus, while other notable cities include [[Brussels]] and [[Ghent]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe1" /&gt;

Rubens, in particular, had a strong influence on seventeenth-century visual culture. His innovations helped define Antwerp as one of Europe's major artistic cities, especially for [[Counter Reformation]] imagery, and his student Van Dyck was instrumental in establishing new directions in English portraiture. Other developments in Flemish [[Baroque]] painting are similar to those found in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]],&lt;ref name="vlieghe1" /&gt; with artists specializing in such areas as [[history painting]], [[portrait painting|portraiture]], [[genre painting]], [[landscape painting]], and [[still life]].
{{History of Dutch and Flemish painting}}

==General characteristics==
"Flemish", in the context of this and artistic periods such as the "Flemish Primitives" (in English now [[Early Netherlandish painting]]), often includes the regions not associated with modern [[Flanders]], including the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and the autonomous [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe1" /&gt; By the seventeenth century, however, Antwerp was the main city for innovative artistic production, largely due to the presence of Rubens. Brussels was important as the location of the court, attracting [[David Teniers the Younger]] later in the century.

[[File:Frans Hogenberg Bildersturm 1566.jpg|thumb|left|Frans Hogenberg, The Calvinist [[beeldenstorm|Iconoclastic Riot of August 20, 1566]] when many paintings and church decorations were destroyed and subsequently replaced by late [[Northern Mannerist]] and Baroque artists.]]

===Late Mannerism===
Although paintings produced at the end of the 16th century belong to general [[Northern Mannerist]] and Late [[Renaissance]] approaches that were common throughout Europe, artists such as [[Otto van Veen]], [[Adam van Noort]], [[Marten de Vos]], and the [[Francken]] family were particularly instrumental in setting the stage for the local Baroque. Between 1585 and the early 17th century they made many new [[altarpiece]]s to replace those destroyed during the [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] [[beeldenstorm|outbreaks of 1566]]. Also during this time [[Frans Francken the Younger]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] became important for their small [[cabinet painting]]s, often depicting [[Mythology|mythological]] and history subjects.

==="The Age of Rubens"===
[[Peter Paul Rubens]] (1577–1640), a student of both Otto van Veen and Adam van Noort, spent eight years in Italy (1600–1608), during which time he studied examples of [[classical antiquity]], the [[Italian Renaissance]], and contemporaries [[Adam Elsheimer]] and [[Caravaggio]]. Following his return to Antwerp he set up an important studio, training students such as Anthony van Dyck, and generally exerting a strong influence on the direction of Flemish art. Most artists active in the city during the first half of the 17th century were directly influenced by Rubens.

This painting is Flemish Baroque example of collaboration and specialization. Snyders, who specialized in animals, painted the eagle while Rubens painted the figure of Prometheus.]]

===Specializations and collaborations===
Flemish art is notable for the large amount of collaboration that took place between independent masters, which was partly related to the local tendency to specialize in a particular area. [[Frans Snyders]], for example, was an animal painter and Jan Brueghel the Elder was admired for his landscapes and paintings of plants. Both artists worked with Rubens, who often usually painted the figures, and other artists to create collaborative pieces.

[[File:Frans Francken d. J. 009.jpg|thumb|left|Frans Francken the Younger, ''Preziosenwand'' (''Wall of Treasures''), 1636. Kunsthistorischesmuseum, Vienna. This type of painting was one of the distinctly Flemish innovations that developed during the early 17th century.]]

===Innovations===
Flower [[still life]] painting, which developed around 1600 by artists such as Jan Brueghel the Elder, was partially a Flemish innovation,&lt;ref name="vlieghe207"&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 207–212.&lt;/ref&gt; echoed in the Dutch Republic in the works of the Antwerp-born [[Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder]] (1573–1621).&lt;ref&gt;Slive, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; In Antwerp, however, this new genre also developed into a specifically [[Catholic]] type of painting, the [[flower garland]]. Other types of paintings closely associated with Flemish Baroque include the monumental hunting scenes by Rubens and Snyders, and [[gallery paintings]] by artists such as [[Willem van Haecht]] and [[David Teniers the Younger]].

==History painting==
History painting, which includes biblical, mythological and historical subjects, was considered by seventeenth-century theoreticians as the most noble art. [[Abraham Janssens]] was an important history painter in Antwerp between 1600 and 1620, although after 1609 Rubens was the leading figure. Both Van Dyck and [[Jacob Jordaens]] were active painting monumental history scenes. Following Rubens's death, Jordaens became the most important Flemish painter. Other notable artists working in the idiom of Rubens include [[Gaspar de Crayer]], who was active in Brussels, [[Artus Wolffort]], [[Cornelis de Vos]], [[Jan Cossiers]], [[Theodoor van Thulden]], [[Abraham van Diepenbeeck]], and [[Jan Boeckhorst]]. During the second half of the century, history painters combined a local influence from Rubens with knowledge of [[classicism]] and Italian [[Baroque]] qualities. Artists in the vein include [[Erasmus Quellinus the Younger]], [[Jan van den Hoecke]], [[Pieter van Lint]], [[Cornelis Schut]], and [[Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert]]. Later in the century, many painters turned to Anthony van Dyck as a major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 98–104.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them were [[Pieter Thijs]], [[Lucas Franchoys the Younger]], and artists who were also inspired by Late Baroque theatricality such as [[Theodoor Boeyermans]] and [[Jan-Erasmus Quellinus]]. Additionally, a Flemish variant of ''[[Caravaggism]]'' was expressed by [[Theodoor Rombouts]] and [[Gerard Seghers]].

==Religious painting==
Rubens is closely associated with the development of the Baroque [[altarpiece]]. Painted for the Arquebusiers' [[guild]], the ''[[Descent from the Cross]]'' [[triptych]] (1611–14; [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp]])—with side wings depicting the ''[[Visitation (Christian)|Visitation]]'' and ''[[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Presentation in the Temple]]'', and exterior panels showing ''[[St. Christopher]] and the Hermit''—is an important reflection of Counter-Reformation ideas about art combined with Baroque naturalism, dynamism and monumentality.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, pp. 113–121.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger de Piles]] explains that "the painter has entered so fully into the expression of his subject that the sight of this work has the power to touch a hardened soul and cause it to experience the sufferings endured by Jesus Christ in order to redeem it."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Baroque'', pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles I of England.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Anthony van Dyck, ''Portrait of King Charles I'', 1635. Louvre, Paris.]]

==Portraiture==
Although not predominately a portrait painter, Rubens's contributions include early works such as his ''Portrait of Brigida Spinola-Doria'' (1606, [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]]), paintings of his wives (the ''[[Honeysuckle Bower]]'' and ''[[Het Pelsken]]''), and numerous portraits of friends and nobility. He also exerted a strong influence on Baroque portraiture through his student [[Anthony van Dyck]]. Van Dyck became court painter for [[Charles I of England]] and was influential on subsequent English portraiture. Other successful portraitists include [[Cornelis de Vos]] and [[Jacob Jordaens]]. Although most Flemish portraiture is life-sized or monumental, [[Gonzales Coques]] and [[Gillis van Tilborch]] specialized in small-scale group portraiture.
[[File:Adriaen Brouwer - The Bitter Potion - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Adriaen Brouwer, ''The Bitter Drink'', ''c''. 1630–1640. Brouwer's expressive peasants are typical of "low-life" genre painting.]]

==Genre painting==
[[Genre painting]]s, or scenes of everyday life, are common in the 17th century. Many artists follow the tradition of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] in depicting "low-life" peasant themes, although elegant "high-life" subjects featuring fashionably-dressed couples at [[Ball (dance)|balls]] or in gardens of love are also common. [[Adriaen Brouwer]], whose small paintings often show peasants fighting and drinking, was particularly influential on subsequent artists. Images of woman performing household tasks, popularized in the northern Netherlands by [[Pieter de Hooch]] and [[Jan Vermeer]], is not a significant subject in the south, although artists such as [[Jan Siberechts]] explored these themes to some degree.

===Bruegel tradition===
Flemish genre painting is strongly tied to the traditions of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] and was a style that continued directly into the 17th century through copies and new compositions made by his sons [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]]. Many of these are [[Kermesse (festival)|kermis]] paintings and scenes of peasants taking part in other outdoor enjoyments viewed from an elevated viewpoint. Artists in the Dutch Republic, such as the Flemish-born [[David Vinckboons]] and [[Roelandt Savery]], also made similar works, popularizing rustic scenes of everyday life closely associated with Dutch and Flemish painting.

===Adriaen Brouwer and his followers===
[[Adriaen Brouwer]] (1605 or 1606–1638) typically painted small scenes of ragged peasants fighting, gaming, drinking and generally expressing exaggerated and rude behaviour. Born in the Southern Netherlands, Brouwer spent the 1620s in [[Amsterdam]] and [[Haarlem]], where he came under the influence of [[Frans Hals|Frans]] and [[Dirk Hals]] and other artists working in a loose [[painterly]] manner. Upon his return to Antwerp around 1631 or 1632 he introduced a new, influential format in which the subjects were painted as interior, instead of exterior, scenes. He also painted expressive facial studies like ''The Bitter Drink'' (illustrated), a genre called [[tronie]]s ("faces"). Brouwer's art was recognized in his own lifetime and had a powerful impact on Flemish art. Rubens owned more works by him at the time of his death than any other painter, and artists such as [[David Teniers the Younger]], [[Jan van de Venne]], [[Joos van Craesbeeck]] and [[David Ryckaert III]] continued to work in a similar manner.

===Elegant company scenes===
Paintings of elegant couples in the latest fashions, often with underlying themes of love or the [[sense|five senses]], were commonly painted by [[Hieronymus Francken II|Hieronymus Francken the Younger]], [[Louis de Caullery]], [[Simon de Vos]], [[David Teniers the Younger]] and [[David Ryckaert III]]. Rubens's ''Garden of Love'' (''c''. 1634–5; [[Prado Museum]]) belongs to these traditions.

===Monumental genre scenes===
Whereas elegant company scenes and works by Brouwer and his followers were often small in scale, other artists looked to [[Caravaggio]] for inspiration and painted large-scale, theatrically inspired scenes in which musicians, cardplayers, and fortune tellers are pushed to the foreground of the composition. These paintings, like others by ''[[Caravaggism|Caravaggisti]]'', are generally illuminated by strong lighting effects. [[Adam de Coster]], [[Gerard Seghers]] and [[Theodoor Rombouts]] were the main exponents of this popular style in the early 17th century, which was popularized by Italian followers of Caravaggio like [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]] and [[Utrecht Caravaggisti]] like [[Gerrit van Honthorst]]. Rombouts was also influenced by his teacher [[Abraham Janssens]], who began incorporating Caravaggesque influences into his history paintings from first decade of the 17th century

[[File:Jakob Jordaens 001.jpg|thumb|left|Jacob Jordaens, ''The King Drinks''. Jordeans was well known for his large paintings of moralistic genre scenes, such as this depiction of an [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] feast.]]

===Jacob Jordaens===
Jacob Jordaens, who became Antwerp's most important artist after Rubens's death in 1640, is well known for his monumental genre paintings of subjects such as ''The King Drinks'' and ''As the Old Sing, So Pipe the Young''. Many of these paintings use compositional and lighting influences similar to those of the ''Caravaggisti'', while the treatment of the subjects inspired Dutch artists like [[Jan Steen]].

===Battle scenes===
Another popular type of painting invented in the [[Low Countries]] was landscapes with historical and fictional battles, as well as skirmishes and robberies. [[Sebastiaen Vrancx]] and his pupil [[Peter Snayers]] specialized in this genre, and Snayer's student [[Adam-Frans van der Meulen]] continued painting them in Antwerp, Brussels and [[Paris]] until the end of the century.
[[File:Sweerts, Michael -1649- - Wrestling Match.jpg|thumb|right|Michael Sweerts, ''Wrestling Match'', 1649. Karlsruhe, Staatliche Kunsthalle. Sweerts's style is influenced by his time in Rome, and in this painting he combines a genre subject with classical poses and Italian coloring]]

===Bamboccianti===
Following a time-honoured tradition, many northern artists travelled to Italy in the 17th century. Flemish artists such as [[Jan Miel]] (1599–1664), [[Michael Sweerts]] (1618–1664), [[Anton Goubau]] (1616–1698) and [[Willem Reuter]] (c.1642–1681) went to Rome where they worked for a period of time.  Here they were influenced by the works of the [[Genre works|genre painters]] active in Rome referred to as the [[Bamboccianti]].  The Bamboccianti comprised mostly [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Flemings|Flemish]] artists who had brought existing traditions of depicting peasant subjects from [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|sixteenth-century Netherlandish art]] with them to Italy,&lt;ref name=lev&gt;Levine, David A. (December 1988). "The Roman Limekilns of the Bamboccianti". The Art Bulletin. College Art Association. 70 (4), p. 570&lt;/ref&gt; and generally created small [[cabinet painting]]s or [[etching]]s of the [[everyday life]] of the lower classes in Rome and its countryside.&lt;ref name="haskell"&gt;Haskell, Francis (1993). "Chapter 8". Patrons and Painters: Art and Society in Baroque Italy. Yale University Press, pp. 132–134.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch painter [[Pieter van Laer]] who was nicknamed  "Il Bamboccio" (meaning "ugly doll" or "puppet" in Italian) had started this type of genre painting in Rome.  In general, genre painting was not well-accepted in Italy, especially by official organizations such as the [[Academy of St. Luke]].  Many of the painters were alsom members of the [[Bentvueghels]], the society of mainly Flemish and Dutch artists working in Rome. It acted as a support network for Netherlandish artists in Rome who were in need but is better-known for the "[[bohemian]]" lifestyle of its members and drunken festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, David A., "The Bentvueghels: 'Bande Académique"," in IL60: Essays Honoring Irving Lavin on his Sixtieth Birthday, ed. Marilyn Aronberg Lavin. New York: Italica Press, 1990, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landscape and seascape==

===Early landscape painting===
[[Gillis van Coninxloo]] was an innovative landscape painter in Antwerp in the late 16th century, who introduced a more natural view instead of the traditional [[world landscape]] popularized by earlier painters such as [[Joachim Patiner]]. He left a strong influence on northern landscape painting in general through his period in [[Amsterdam]] and as a founding member of the [[Frankenthal School]]. Forest and mountain landscapes were painted by [[Abraham Govaerts]], [[Alexander Keirincx]], [[Gijsbrecht Leytens]], [[Tobias Verhaecht]] and [[Joos de Momper]]. [[Paul Bril]] settled in Rome, where he specialized as a landscape painter decorating Roman villas and creating small [[cabinet painting]]s.
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - A View of Het Steen in the Early Morning.jpg|thumb|left|Peter Paul Rubens, ''Landscape with view of 'Het Steen''', 1636.]]

===Rubens and later painters===
[[Jan Wildens]] and [[Lucas van Uden]] painted natural landscapes inspired by Rubens, and frequently collaborated with figure painters or animal specialists to paint the backgrounds. Rubens turned to landscape painting in the 1630s, focusing on the area around his chateau, Het Steen. A well-known example is the ''Landscape with a view of 'Het Steen''' ([[National Gallery of London]]).

===Marine painting===
Small seascapes (''zeekens'') were another popular theme. Artists such as [[Bonaventura Peeters]] painted shipwrecks and atmospheric views of ships at sea, as well as imaginary views of exotic ports. [[Hendrik van Minderhout]], who was from [[Rotterdam]] and settled in Antwerp, continued this latter theme contemporaneous with developments of [[marine painting]] in the Dutch Republic.

==Architectural painting==
{{main|Architectural painting}}
Interior architectural views, usually of churches, developed out of the late sixteenth-century works of [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]]. Many were actual locations. [[Pieter Neeffs I]], for example, made numerous interiors of the [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp]]. [[Hendrik van Steenwijk II]], on the other hand, followed Vredeman's precedent in painting imaginary interiors. The genre continued in the later seventeenth century by [[Anton Ghering]] and [[Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg]], but the Flemish examples do not demonstrate the same level of innovation found in the Dutch perspectives of [[Pieter Jansz Saenredam]] or [[Emanuel de Witte]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe200"&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 200–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gallery and art collection painting==
Gallery paintings appeared in Antwerp around 1610, and developed—like architectural interiors—from the compositions of [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]].&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest innovators of this new genre was [[Frans Francken the Younger]], who introduced the type of work known as the ''Preziosenwand'' (wall of treasures). In these, prints, paintings, sculptures, drawings, as well as collectable objects from the natural world like shells and flowers are collected together in the foreground against a wall that imitates encyclopedic [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]]. A similar variation of these collections of artistic wealth are the series of the [[sense|five senses]] created by [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] and Rubens ([[Prado Museum]], [[Madrid]]). [[Willem van Haecht]] (1593–1637) developed another variation in which illustrations of actual artworks are displayed in a fantasy art gallery, while connoisseurs and art lovers admire them. Later in the century, [[David Teniers the Younger]], working in the capacity of court painter to [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria]], documented the archduke's collection of Italian paintings in Brussels as gallery painters as well as in a printed catalogue–the ''[[Theatrum Pictorium]]''. Flemish Gallery and art collection paintings have been interpreted as a kind of visual theory of art.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 202–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Such paintings continued to be made in Antwerp by [[Gerard Thomas]] (1663–1721) and [[Balthasar van den Bossche]] (1681–1715), and foreshadow the development of the [[veduta]] in Italy and the galleries of [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini]].

[[File:Jan Brueghel the Elder - Flowers in a Wooden Vessel - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Jan Brueghel the Elder, ''Flower Still Life'', 1606/7. Brueghel was an innovator of the flower still life genre.]]

==Still life and animal painting==

===Flower painting===
[[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] was one of the important innovators of the floral still life around 1600.&lt;ref name="vlieghe207"/&gt; These paintings, which presented immaculately observed arrangements and compositions, were imaginary creations of  flowers that bloom at different times of the years.&lt;ref name="vlieghe207" /&gt; They were popular with leading patrons and nobility across Europe, and generally have an underlying [[Vanitas]] motif. The compositions of Brueghel's paintings were also influential on later Dutch flower pieces.&lt;ref name="vlieghe208"&gt;Vlieghe, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Brueghel's sons [[Jan Brueghel the Younger]] and [[Ambrosius Brueghel]] were also flower specialists. [[Osias Beert]] (1580–1624) was another flower painter at the beginning of the 17th century. His paintings share many similarities with northern contemporaries such as [[Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe208" /&gt;

===Garland painting===
Closely related to the flower still life is the flower garland genre of painting that was invented by Jan Brueghel in collaboration with [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] [[Federico Borromeo]] in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;David Freedberg, "The Origins and Rise of the Flemish Madonnas in Flower Garlands, Decoration and Devotion", ''Münchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst'', xxxii, 1981, pp. 115–150.&lt;/ref&gt; The early versions of these paintings, such as the collaboration by Breughel and Rubens in Munich ([[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]]) show the [[Virgin Mary]] and [[Christ]] child surrounded by a garland of flowers. They have been interpreted as distinctly Counter Reformation images, with the flowers emphasizing the delicacy of the Virgin and Child–images of which were destroyed in large numbers during the [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] outbreaks of 1566.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg (1981), ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; Brueghel's student, the [[Jesuit]] painter [[Daniel Seghers]], also painted many of these types of works for an international clientele.&lt;ref name="vlieghe209"&gt;Vlieghe, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; In later versions, the fleshy Madonna and Child gave way to sculptural niches and even pagan themes.
[[File:Osias Beert - Oysters 1610.jpg|thumb|right|Osias Beert, ''Still life with oysters'', ''c''. 1610. Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart. Beert's still lifes are typical of the "breakfast" type painted early in the 17th century.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;]]

===Breakfast and banquet still life===
The ''ontbijtje'', or "little breakfast", is a type of still life that was popular in both the northern and southern Netherlands showing a variety of eating and drinking vessels and foods such as cheese and bread against a neutral background. [[Osias Beert]], [[Clara Peeters]], [[Cornelis Mahu]] and [[Jacob Foppens van Es]] (''c''. 1596–1666) were all artists who made these types of painting. More elaborate are the ''pronk'', or "sumptuous", still life. This style developed in the Dutch Republic, and was brought to Antwerp by [[Jan Davidsz de Heem]]. They show, on a larger scale than earlier works, complex compositions of expensive items, rare foods, and fleshy, peeling fruit. These paintings are related to [[vanitas]] and transience motifs.

[[File:Frans SNYDERS, The Pantry.JPG|thumb|left|Frans Snyders, ''The Pantry'', ''c''. 1620.]]

===Animal still life===
[[Frans Snyders]] (1579–1657) painted large still lifes focusing on dead game and animals. His compositions, along with those of his follower [[Adriaen van Utrecht]] (1599–1652). look back to the sixteenth-century paintings of [[Pieter Aertsen]] and [[Joachim Beuckelaer]], but instill that tradition with a High Baroque monumentality.&lt;ref name="vlieghe211"&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 211–216.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent artists, [[Jan Fyt]] and [[Pieter Boel]] further elaborated on this type by including a noticeable mixture of living animals and dead game. These latter paintings are closely related to images of the hunt, which came into fashion in Flemish painting during the 17th century.

[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 110.jpg|thumb|right|Peter Paul Rubens, ''Tiger and Lion Hunt'', ''c''. 1617–1618. Musée des Beaux Arts, Rennes. This painting is typical of Rubens's "exotic" hunts painted between about 1615 and 1625.]]
{{clear|left}}

==Hunting scenes==
Rubens introduced the monumental hunt to Flemish art, depicting on a large scale a close battle inspired by his study of classical antiquity and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|Battle of Anghiari]]''. These works show both noble hunts, such as the ''Wolf and Fox Hunt'' ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]), and exotic hunts, such as the ''Lion Hunt'' ([[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]]). [[Frans Snyders]] and [[Paul de Vos]] created similarly large paintings which are 
distinct from Rubens's works in their focus on the animals and absence of human participation.

==Cabinet painting==
Small, intricate paintings, usually depicting history and biblical subjects, were produced in great numbers in the Southern Netherlands throughout the 17th century. Many were created by anonymous artists, however artists such as [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]], [[Hendrik van Balen]], [[Frans Francken the Younger]] and [[Hendrik de Clerck]] were all successful [[cabinet painting|cabinet painters]] during the first half of the 17th century. These artists, as well as followers of [[Adam Elsheimer]] like [[David Teniers the Elder]], remained partly shaped by continued mannerist stylistic tendencies. However, Rubens influenced a number of later artists who incorporated his Baroque style into the small context of these works. Among them are [[Frans Wouters]], [[Jan Thomas van Ieperen]], [[Simon de Vos]], [[Pieter van Lint]], and [[Willem van Herp]]. These small paintings were traded widely throughout Europe, and by way of Spain to [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 105–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heritage trails''' are walking [[trails]] and driving routes in urban and rural settings that are identified in most cases by signage and guidebooks as relating to [[cultural heritage]].

The heritage might be built, or it can also be cultural heritage narrative.  In most cases it is in public space.

The nature of the trail can be seen to be beneficial for community development,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Southwestern Pennsylvania Heritage Preservation Commission.

In many countries heritage trails are self guided.  However for the interpretation of features and items of historical note, [[Walking tour|tour guides]] are required.

In many countries former [[Abandoned railway|railway formations]] are used as walking and heritage trails.

'''Historic Houses''' (formerly, and still for legal purposes, known as The Historic Houses Association or '''HHA''') is a not-for-profit organisation that represents more than 1,650 privately owned historic [[English country house|country house]]s, castles and gardens throughout the UK.  The association was established in 1973 to help owners maintain and conserve significant homes in the interests of the nation's heritage. It carries out important lobbying, advisory and marketing work on behalf of member properties and runs an access scheme for the general public. These are listed buildings or registered gardens, usually Grade I or II* and often rated as outstanding.

Around 500 of these properties open their doors to visitors for days out, special tours, school visits, film locations, weddings and events, or as memorable places to stay, attracting between them 14 million visitors each year.  Others open by appointment or for special visits, weddings or corporate events.  There are more privately owned historic houses open to the public than those in the care of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], [[English Heritage]] and their equivalents in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland put together.  Historic Houses works for the future of these houses, the heritage they conserve and the businesses, families and employees they support by lobbying at national, regional and local level.  It provides technical and specialist advice and guidance, seminars, networks and information for its member houses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historichouses.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Historic Houses offers a membership to the public, allowing card-holders free entry to around 320 of the association's member properties that open to the public as visitor attractions. Members also receive have access to tours of hundreds more houses which are not normally open. The association publishes a quarterly magazine, "Historic House."

'''James Ussher''' (or '''Usher'''; 4 January 1581&amp;nbsp;– 21 March 1656) was the [[Church of Ireland]] [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]] and [[Primate of All Ireland]] between 1625 and 1656. He was a prolific scholar and church leader, who today is most famous for his identification of the genuine letters of the church father, Ignatius, and for his chronology that sought to establish the time and date of the [[Genesis creation myth|creation]] as "the entrance of the night preceding the 23rd day of October... the year before Christ 4004"; that is, around 6 pm on 22 October 4004&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} according to the [[proleptic Julian calendar]].

==Education==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
Ussher was born in [[Dublin]] to a well-to-do family. His maternal grandfather, [[James Stanihurst]], had been speaker of the [[Irish House of Commons|Irish parliament]]. Ussher's father, Arland Ussher, was a clerk in chancery who married [[James Stanihurst]]'s daughter, Margaret (by his first wife Anne Fitzsimon), who was reportedly a Roman Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Stanyhurst, Richard|volume=54|first=Sidney|last=Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ussher's younger, and only surviving, brother, [[Ambrose Ussher|Ambrose]], became a distinguished scholar of [[Arabic]] and [[Hebrew languages|Hebrew]]. According to his chaplain and biographer, [[Nicholas Bernard]], the elder brother was taught to read by two blind, spinster aunts. A gifted [[Polyglot (person)|polyglot]], he entered Dublin Free School and then the newly founded (1591) [[Trinity College, Dublin]] on 9 January 1594, at the age of thirteen (not an unusual age at the time). He had received his Bachelor of Arts degree by 1598, and was a fellow and MA by 1600 (though Bernard claims he did not gain his MA till 1601). In May 1602, he was ordained in the Trinity College Chapel as a deacon in the [[Protestant]], [[state religion|established]], [[Church of Ireland]] (and possibly priest on the same day) by his uncle [[Henry Ussher]], the Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland.

Ussher went on to become [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|Chancellor]] of [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]] in 1605 and [[Prebendary|Prebend]] of [[Finglas]].  He became Professor of Theological Controversies at Trinity College and a Bachelor of Divinity in 1607, Doctor of Divinity in 1612, and then [[Vice-Chancellor]] in 1615 and vice-provost in 1616. In 1613, he married Phoebe, daughter of a previous [[Provost (education)|Vice-Provost]], Luke Challoner, and published his first work. In 1615, he was closely involved with the drawing up of the first [[confession of faith]] of the Church of Ireland.

==Early life and career== &lt;!-- Anchor from redirect from [Elizabeth Tyrrell]; caution. --&gt;
In 1619 Ussher travelled to England, where he remained for two years.  His only child was Elizabeth (1619–93), who married [[Sir Timothy Tyrrell]], of [[Oakley, Buckinghamshire]]. She was the mother of [[James Tyrrell (writer)|James Tyrrell]]. He became prominent after meeting [[James I of England|James I]]. In 1621 James I nominated Ussher [[Bishop of Meath]]. He became a national figure in Ireland, becoming [[Privy Councillor]] in 1623 and an increasingly substantial scholar. A noted collector of Irish manuscripts, he made them available for research to fellow-scholars such as his friend, [[Sir James Ware]].  From 1623 until 1626 he was again in England and was excused from his episcopal duties to study church history. He was nominated [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of All Ireland and [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]] in 1625 and succeeded [[Christopher Hampton (bishop)|Christopher Hampton]], who had succeeded Ussher's uncle Henry twelve years earlier.

==Primate of All Ireland==

[[File:Jacobus ussher.gif|thumbnail|left|Archbishop James Ussher (1581–1656)]]
After his consecration in 1626, Ussher found himself in turbulent political times.  Tension was rising between England and Spain, and to secure Ireland [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] offered Irish Catholics a series of concessions, including religious toleration, known as [[the Graces (Ireland)|The Graces]], in exchange for money for the upkeep of the army. Ussher was a convinced [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and viewed with dismay the possibility that people he regarded as anti-Christian papists might achieve any sort of power. He called a secret meeting of the Irish bishops in his house in November 1626, the result being the "Judgement of the Arch-Bishops and Bishops of Ireland".  This begins:

{{quote|The religion of the papists is superstitious and idolatrous; their faith and doctrine erroneous and heretical; their church in respect of both, apostatical; to give them therefore a toleration, or to consent that they may freely exercise their religion, and profess their faith and doctrine, is a grievous sin.}}

The Judgement was not published until it was read out at the end of a series of sermons against the Graces given at Dublin in April 1627.  In the end, the Graces were not confirmed by the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

During a four-year interregnum between Lord Deputies from 1629 on, there was an increase in efforts to impose religious conformity on Ireland. In 1633, Ussher wrote to the new [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[William Laud]], in an effort to gain support for the imposition of [[recusancy]] fines on Irish Catholics. [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth]], who arrived as the new Lord Deputy in Ireland in 1633, deflected the pressure for conformity by stating that firstly, the Church of Ireland itself would have to be properly resourced, and he set about its re-endowment. He settled the long-running primacy dispute between the sees of [[Armagh]] and [[Dublin]] in Armagh's favour. The two clashed on the subject of the theatre: Ussher had the usual Puritan antipathy to the stage, whereas Wentworth was a keen theatre-goer, and against Ussher's opposition, oversaw the foundation of Ireland's first theatre, the [[Werburgh Street Theatre]].

Ussher soon found himself at odds with the rise of [[Arminianism]] and Wentworth and Laud's desire for conformity between the [[Church of England]] and the more Calvinistic [[Church of Ireland]]. Ussher resisted this pressure at a [[convocation]] in 1634, ensuring that the English [[Thirty-Nine Articles|Articles of Religion]] were adopted as well as the Irish articles, not instead of them, and that the Irish [[Canon law|canons]] had to be redrafted based on the English ones rather than replaced by them. Theologically, he was a Calvinist although on the matter of the atonement he was (somewhat privately) a [[hypothetical universalist]]. His most significant influence in this regard was [[John Davenant]], later an English delegate to the [[Synod of Dort]], who managed to significantly soften that Synod's teaching regarding limited atonement.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, J.D. (2007) English Hypothetical Universalism, Cambridge: Eerdmans.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1633, Ussher had supported the appointment of [[William Laud|Archbishop Laud]] as Chancellor of the [[University of Dublin]]. He had hoped that Laud would help to impose order on what was, Ussher accepted, a somewhat mismanaged institution. Laud did that, rewriting the charter and statutes to limit the authority of the fellows, and ensure that the appointment of the provost was under royal control. In 1634, he imposed on the College an Arminian provost, [[William Chappell (bishop)|William Chappell]], whose theological views, and peremptory style of government, were antithetical to everything for which Ussher stood. By 1635, it was apparent that Ussher had lost de facto control of the church to [[John Bramhall]], Bishop of [[Derry]], in everyday matters and to Laud in matters of policy.

William M. Abbott, Associate Professor of History at [[Fairfield University]], argues that he was an effective and politically important bishop and archbishop.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, William M. (1990). "James Ussher and "Ussherian" episcopacy, 1640–1656: the primate and his Reduction manuscript." ''Albion'' xxii: 237–259.&lt;/ref&gt; The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography notes that he was reactive and sought conciliation rather than confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;''James Ussher'', [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The story that he successfully opposed attempts to reintroduce the [[Irish language]] for use in church services by [[William Bedell]], the Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kilmore|Kilmore]], has been refuted.&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan, W. S. (1968). "Review of R. B. Knox, James Ussher Archbishop of Armagh", ''Irish Historical Studies'' xvi: 215–19.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leerssen, J. (1982–1983). "Archbishop Ussher and Gaelic culture", ''Studia Hibernica'' xxii–xxiii: 50–58.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN, if any--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Ussher certainly preferred to be a scholar when he could be. He engaged in extensive disputations with Roman Catholic theologians, and even as a student he challenged a [[Jesuit]] relative, [[Henry Fitzsimon]] (Ussher's mother was Catholic), to dispute publicly the identification of the Pope with the [[Antichrist]]. [[File:Rare Small BX 5530 .U8 I4 1643 000005.tif|thumb|right|The title page of "Immanuel, or the Mystery of the Incarnation of the Son of God," authored in 1643.]] However, Ussher also wrote extensively on theology,&lt;ref&gt;e.g., [https://archive.org/details/nd613931085/page/n3 "Immanuel, or the mystery of Incarnation of God."]&lt;/ref&gt; patristics and ecclesiastical history, and these subjects gradually displaced his anti-Catholic work. After Convocation in 1634, Ussher left Dublin for his episcopal residence at [[Drogheda]], where he concentrated on his archdiocese and his research. In 1631, he produced a new edition of a work first published in 1622, his "Discourse on the Religion Anciently Professed by the Irish", a ground-breaking study of the [[Celtic Christianity|early Irish church]], which sought to demonstrate how it differed from Rome and was, instead, much closer to the later Protestant church. This was to prove highly influential, establishing the idea that the Church of Ireland was the true successor of the early Celtic church.

In 1639, he published the most substantial history of Christianity in Britain to that date, ''Britannicarum ecclesiarum antiquitates''&amp;nbsp;— the antiquities of the British churches. It was an astonishing achievement in one respect&amp;nbsp;— in gathering together so many previously unpublished manuscript sources. Ussher was very reluctant to arrive at firm judgements as to the sources' authenticity&amp;nbsp;— hence his devotion of a whole chapter to the imaginative but invented stories of [[King Lucius]] and the creation of a Christian episcopate in Britain.

==English Civil War==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
[[File:James Ussher portrait.jpg|thumb|left|In the years before the [[English Civil War]], James Ussher's reputation as a scholar and his moderate Calvinism meant that his opinion was sought by both King and Parliament.]]

In 1640, Ussher left Ireland for England for what turned out to be the last time. In the years before the [[English Civil War]], his reputation as a scholar and his moderate Calvinism meant that his opinion was sought by both King and Parliament. After Ussher lost his home and income through the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|Irish uprising]] of 1641, Parliament voted him a pension of £400 while the King awarded him the income and property of the vacant [[See of Carlisle]].

Despite  their occasional differences, he remained a loyal friend  to the [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Earl of Strafford]], and when the latter was sentenced to death by Parliament, pleaded with the King not to allow the execution of the verdict: unlike some of his episcopal colleagues, he insisted that the King was absolutely bound in conscience by his promise to Strafford that whatever happened his life would be spared. The King did not take his advice, but clearly  afterwards regretted not doing so, as is shown by his reference on the scaffold to Strafford's death as "that unjust sentence which I suffered to take effect".

In early 1641 Ussher developed a mediatory position on church government, which sought to bridge the gap between the Laudians, who believed that bishops were divinely ordained and a separate order from priests and deacons, and the presbyterians, who wanted to abolish episcopacy entirely. His proposals, not published until 1656, after his death, as The Reduction of Episcopacy, proposed a compromise where bishops operated in a presbyterian [[synodal]] system, were initially designed to support a rapprochement between Charles and the parliamentarian leadership in 1641, but were rejected by the King. They did, however, have an afterlife, being published in England and Scotland well into the eighteenth century. In all, he wrote or edited five books relating to episcopacy; the last two, treatises on the [[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatian]] epistles, were particular scholarly achievements that have largely survived modern scrutiny.

As the middle ground between King and Parliament vanished in 1641–1642, Ussher was forced, reluctantly, to choose between his Calvinist allies in parliament and his instinctive loyalty to the monarchy. Eventually, in January 1642 (having asked parliament's permission), he moved to Oxford, a royalist stronghold. Though Charles severely tested Ussher's loyalty by negotiating with the Catholic Irish, the Primate remained committed to the royal cause, though as king's fortunes waned Ussher had to move on to [[Bristol]], [[Cardiff]], and then to [[St Donat's Castle|St Donat's]].

In June 1646, he returned to London under the protection of his friend, [[John Mordaunt, 1st Earl of Peterborough|Elizabeth, Dowager Countess of Peterborough]], in whose houses he stayed from then on. He became a preacher at [[Lincoln's Inn]] early in 1647, and despite his royalist loyalties was protected by his friends in Parliament. He watched the execution of Charles I from the roof of the Countess of Peterborough's home in London but fainted before the axe fell.

==Chronology==
{{main|Ussher chronology}}
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
Ussher now concentrated on his research and writing and returned to the study of chronology and the [[church fathers]]. After a 1647 work on the origin of the [[Creed]]s, Ussher published a treatise on the calendar in 1648. This was a warm-up for his most famous work, the ''[[Annales veteris testamenti, a prima mundi origine deducti]]'' ("Annals of the Old Testament, deduced from the first origins of the world"), which appeared in 1650, and its continuation, ''Annalium pars posterior'', published in 1654. In this work, he calculated the date of the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] to have been nightfall on 22 October 4004 BC. (Other scholars, such as [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] academic, [[John Lightfoot]], calculated their own dates for the Creation.) The time of the [[Ussher chronology]] is frequently misquoted as being 9 a.m., noon or 9 p.m. on 23 October. See the [[Ussher chronology|related article on the chronology]] for a discussion of its claims and methodology.

Ussher's work is now used to support [[Young Earth Creationism]], which holds that the universe was created thousands of years ago (rather than billions). But while calculating the date of the Creation is today considered a controversial activity, in Ussher's time such a calculation was still regarded as an important task, one previously attempted by many Post-Reformation scholars, such as [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] and physicist [[Isaac Newton]].

Ussher's chronology represented a considerable feat of scholarship: it demanded great depth of learning in what was then known of ancient history, including the rise of the Persians, Greeks and Romans, as well as expertise in the Bible, biblical languages, astronomy, ancient calendars and chronology. Ussher's account of historical events for which he had multiple sources other than the Bible is usually in close agreement with modern accounts—for example, he placed the death of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] in 323 BC and that of [[Julius Caesar]] in 44 BC. Ussher's last extra-biblical co-ordinate was the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar, and beyond this point he had to rely on other considerations. Faced with inconsistent texts of the Torah, each with a different number of years between Flood and Creation, Ussher chose the Masoretic version, which claims an unbroken history of careful transcription stretching back centuries—but his choice was confirmed for him, because it placed Creation exactly four thousand years before 4 BC, the generally accepted date for the birth of the 'Jesus' of the Christian faith; moreover, he calculated, Solomon's temple was completed in the year 3000 from creation, so that there were exactly 1000 years from the temple to Jesus, who was thought to be the 'fulfillment' of the Temple.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, James. ''Biblical Chronology: Legend Or Science?'' The Ethel M. Wood Lecture 1987. Delivered at the Senate House, University of London on 4 March 1987. London: University of London, 1987, p. 19 {{OCLC|19643211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ussher remains extremely popular amongst creationists, even though they reject his methodology of using the most up to date contemporary scientific, chronological, historical and biblical scholarship to date the age of the world.

==Death==
[[File:James Ussher.jpg|thumb|James Ussher's reported last words were "O Lord forgive me, especially my sins of omission".]]
In 1655, Ussher published his last book, ''De Graeca Septuaginta Interpretum Versione'', the first serious examination of the [[Septuagint]], discussing its accuracy as compared with the Hebrew text of the Old Testament. In 1656, he went to stay in the Countess of Peterborough's house in [[Reigate]], Surrey. On 19 March, he felt a sharp pain in his side after supper and took to his bed. His symptoms seem to have been those of a severe internal haemorrhage.  Two days later he died, aged 75. His last words were reported as: "O Lord, forgive me, especially my sins of omission."  His body was embalmed and was to have been buried in Reigate, but at [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]'s insistence he was given a state funeral on 17 April and was buried in the chapel of St Erasmus in [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/james-ussher James Ussher profile], westminster-abbey.org; accessed 1 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Joe &amp; Mac 2: Lost in the Tropics''''' - released in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Tatakae Genshijin 3: Shuyaku wa yappari Joe &amp; Mac'''''|ジョー アンド マック 戦え原始人3 主役はやっぱりJOE &amp; MAC||}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://superfamicom.org/info/tatakae-genshijin-3-shuyaku-ha-yappari-joe-and-mac| title = Japanese-English title translation| publisher = SuperFamicom.org| date = | accessdate = 2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Europe as '''''Joe &amp; Mac 3: Lost in the Tropics''''' - is a [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] video game and a sequel to ''[[Joe &amp; Mac]]''. It is the follow-up to ''[[Congo's Caper]]'', the second game in the series.&lt;ref name="girlfriend"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
A caveman named Gork has stolen the [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] belonging to the [[Tribal chief|Chief]] of Kali Village, and it's up to the player to retrieve it by using the seven [[rainbow]] stones that he will receive in the story.&lt;ref name="mobygames"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/joe-mac-2-lost-in-the-tropics| title = Story overview/additional release information| publisher = [[MobyGames]]| date = | accessdate = 2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JoeandMac2BossBattleScrenShotSNES.jpg|200px|left|thumb|A two-player match against an ''Elasmosaurus''.]]

The object of the game is to defeat [[Neanderthal]]s with two caveman ninja heroes along with [[dinosaur]]s and huge level [[boss (video games)|boss]]es. Each player controls either Joe or Mac with limited lives and continues. Players can also choose to fall in love with a [[girlfriend]] in their [[Stone Age]] village; giving her flowers and meat as presents. Once the player gets married, he gets to father a child. Stone wheels are the official currency in the game and players can replay levels in order to get more stone wheels. An overhead free roam map offers a chance for players to select their level like they were playing a console role-playing game. The action-packed levels are in side view.&lt;ref name="mobygames"/&gt;&lt;ref name="girlfriend"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/joeandmac/joeandmac2.htm| title = Advanced story overview| publisher = Hard Core Gaming 101| date = | accessdate = 2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boss enemies include ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', ''[[Pteranodon]]'', ''[[Triceratops]]'', ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'', and ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. After defeating each boss, the player will earn one of the rainbow stones. During the game, friendly creatures such as ''Pteranodon'', ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' and ''[[Plesiosaurus]]'' will give the player a ride. 

The game features six levels, including a valley, a jungle, a snowy mountain range, a swamp, and a volcano. In the final level, the player must defeat each of the boss enemies a second time before battling Gork. When Gork is defeated, he gains power from the crown and turns into a [[warthog]] demon. When Gork is defeated a second time, the player will earn the crown and end the game.

==Reception==
''[[GamePro]]'' gave the game a moderately positive review, commenting that "If you already like Joe and his buddy Mac, you'll like 'em even more after playing this long, colorful game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Joe &amp; Mac 2: Lost in the Tropics|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=58|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1994|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[IGN]] listed the game as number 61 on their list of the top 100 SNES video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/snes-games/61|title=Top 100 Super Nintendo (SNES) Video Games {{ndash}} Joe &amp; Mac 2: Lost in the Tropics|publisher=[[IGN]]|year=2011|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a palace of the ruling [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] house of Prussia until the abolition of the monarchy at the end of [[World War I]]. It then became an annexe of the [[National Gallery (Berlin)|Berlin National Gallery]], housing a preeminent collection of modern art. It was closed by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] and the building was destroyed in [[World War II]]. It was rebuilt in 1968 and used by [[East Germany]] as a guest house for official visitors to their capital of [[East Berlin]]. Since [[German reunification]] it has been used for exhibitions and cultural events.

==Earliest uses==
[[Johann Arnold Nering]] created the building in 1663&amp;ndash;69 as the private residence of Cabinet Secretary Johann Martitz, converting an existing middle-class house.&lt;ref name=Barock&gt;Hans Reuther, ''Barock in Berlin: Meister und Werke der Berliner Baukunst 1640-1786'', Berlin: Rembrandt, 1969, {{OCLC|476510798}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mMtDAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Johann+Martitz+Kronprinzenpalais&amp;dq=Johann+Martitz+Kronprinzenpalais&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=szwLGJ5XX_&amp;sig=u18ZmErXAwsz-pAkTasjEyfhvKQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=07c7UNz6E6jFigL05IDwBg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ p. 129] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Wietzorek, ''Das historische Berlin: Bilder erzählen'', Petersberg: Imhof, 2005, {{ISBN|9783865680501}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fU5oAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Kronprinzenpalais+Nering&amp;dq=Kronprinzenpalais+Nering&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q_pWTVJw2q&amp;sig=NwbD8N0qDKKPjqAfWfwSZdsgDNc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PAZCUOurN4qyiQKVhYHYDw&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBjgK p. 148] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1706 to 1732, it was the official residence of the Governor of Berlin.&lt;ref name=Landmark&gt;[http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/cgi-bin/hidaweb/getdoc.pl?DOK_TPL=lda_doc.tpl&amp;KEY=obj%2009095949 Kronprinzenpalais], Denkmale in Berlin, Senatsverwaltung für Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1732, [[Philipp Gerlach]] remodelled the building in [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] style with a protruding central bay and a carriage drive rising to the front entrance, to serve as a residence for the Crown Prince, the future King [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]].&lt;ref name=Barock/&gt;&lt;ref name=Landmark/&gt; He and his wife [[Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Bevern|Elisabeth Christine]] stayed there only intermittently before his accession to the throne in 1740, after which he took up residence in part of the [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|royal palace]]. He gave the Kronprinzenpalais to his brother [[Prince Augustus William of Prussia|Augustus William]]; after Augustus William's death in 1758, his widow continued to use it until 1780.

The building was then renovated and refurnished in Neoclassical style (with furniture from Prussia rather than France) and became the residence of Crown Prince Frederick William (the future [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]]) and his wife [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Louise]], who lived there with their children and [[Sophie Marie von Voss|Countess Voss]], who had an apartment near the entrance.&lt;ref name=Landmark/&gt;&lt;ref name=Luise&gt;Daniel Schönpflug, ''Luise von Preußen: Königin der Herzen; eine Biographie'', Munich: Beck, 2010, {{ISBN|9783406598135}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=F-j1liS4YbYC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=Kronprinzenpalais+Statuen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ye_97gYlIu&amp;sig=ptdBEBsG9ZBCRRxcSlafnswX89c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w2U7UPXENabwiwLah4GIBg&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Kronprinzenpalais%20Statuen&amp;f=false pp. 109&amp;ndash;11] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; They remained there after he became king and the Palace was now called ''Königliches Palais'' (Royal Palace).&lt;ref name=Ladd&gt;Brian Ladd, ''The Companion Guide to Berlin'', Woodbridge, Suffolk/Rochester, New York: Companion Guides/Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2004, {{ISBN|9781900639286}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MY0udx6aJroC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=National+Gallery+Berlin+Crown+Prince%27s+Palace&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ffXQT7qlOqjL2QXAp_iCDw&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 32].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Gottfried Schadow]] created his double statue of Crown Princess Louise and her sister [[Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Frederica]], the ''Prinzessinnengruppe'', in the palace in 1795&amp;ndash;97.

In 1856&amp;ndash;57, [[Johann Heinrich Strack]] extensively rebuilt the palace for William I's son, Prince Frederick William (the future [[Kaiser Frederick III]]), giving it substantially its present appearance. Strack replaced the [[mansard roof]] with a third storey with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] pillars, and added neo-classical details to the façade, whose columns he changed from [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] to Corinthian.&lt;ref name=Landmark/&gt; The four statues above the entrance remained,&lt;ref name=Luise/&gt; but he added a tall columned [[portico]] surmounted by a balcony. He also built a setback addition on the east side of the building, with a [[colonnade]] on its Unter den Linden and Niederlagstraße sides.&lt;ref name=Landmark/&gt; After 1861, when Frederick William's father acceded to the throne and he became Crown Prince, the building was once again known as the Kronprinzenpalais; he resided there with his wife [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Princess Victoria]], daughter of England's [[Queen Victoria]].

Their eldest son, who would be the last German Emperor as [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], was born in the palace on 27 January 1859.&lt;ref&gt;John C. G. Röhl, "Wilhelm II.

After the dissolution of the monarchy, the palace became a possession of the State of Prussia, which gave it to the National Gallery in 1919 to house its drawing collection.&lt;ref&gt;According to Giloi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3DFPBIFKk7YC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=Kronprinzenpalais+Statuen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QyobDOdYt1&amp;sig=BxuFgVHge3rWCf0e24XOkDALLP8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w2U7UPXENabwiwLah4GIBg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&amp;q=Kronprinzenpalais%20and%20its%20ajoining%20Prinzessinnenpalais%20were%20awarded%20to%20the%20National%20Gallery&amp;f=false p. 345], the Prinzessinnenpalais as well.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lorente&gt;Jesús Pedro Lorente, tr.

The garden, which extends from Oberwallstraße to Niederlagstraße and has underground parking garages under part of it, was newly laid out in 1969&amp;ndash;70 by W. Hinkefuß and descends in terraces to a central lawn, and then rises again in further terraces to a restaurant called the Schinkelklause, which incorporates pieces of terracotta and an entrance from Schinkel's [[Bauakademie]], which was partially destroyed in World War II and demolished around 1960.

}}'''Loup''' is an extinct [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language, or possibly group of languages, spoken in colonial [[New England]]. ''Loup'' ("Wolf") was a [[French language|French]] colonial ethnographic term, and usage was inconsistent. In modern literature, it refers to two varieties, '''Loup A''' and '''Loup B'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Goddard|first = Ives|date = To appear|title = The 'Loup' Languages of Western Massachusetts: The Dialectal Diversity of Southern New England Algonquian.|url =|journal = Papers of the 44th Algonquian Conference|publisher = SUNY Press|pages = 104–138|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Attestation==
Loup A, which may be the language of the [[Nipmuck]], is principally attested from a word list recorded from refugees by the [[Saint-François-du-Lac, Quebec|St. Francis]] mission to the [[Abenaki]] in [[Quebec]]. The descendants of these refugees became speakers of Western Abenaki in the eighteenth century. Loup B refers to a second word list, which shows extensive dialectal variation. This may not be a distinct language, but just notes on the speech of various New England Algonquian refugees in French missions.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Golla, 2007.

{{WWIITheatre}}

The '''Middle East Theatre of World War II''' is defined largely by reference to the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Middle East Command]], which controlled [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] in both [[Western Asia|Southwest Asia]] and eastern [[North Africa]]. From 1943, most of the action and forces concerned were in the adjoining [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean Theatre]].

The region was quiet for the first few months of the war, until [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] declared war against [[France]] and Britain&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldatwar.net/timeline/other/diplomacy39-45.html Chronology of World War II Diplomacy 1939 - 1945] Italy did not declare war on all the Allied nations. For example after Italy's declaration of war on France and Britain on June 10, the next day France declares war on Italy and Great Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa state that they are at war with Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; on June 10, 1940. It remained a major active [[Theater (warfare)|theatre]] for two and a half years until the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] [[Eighth Army (United_Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] crossed the border from [[Libya]] into [[Tunisia]]. In February 1943, command of the Eighth Army passed from Middle East Command to the Allied Joint command for the Mediterranean, [[Allied Force Headquarters|Allied Forces Headquarters]] (AFHQ). Saudi Arabia, posturing as neutral though somewhat favoring the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;''A Country Study: Saudi Arabia''. Library of Congress Call Number DS204 .S3115 1993. Chapter 5. "World War II and Its Aftermath"&lt;/ref&gt; officially declared war on Germany and Japan in February 1945, though, in reality, the entire Middle East Theatre was quiet from 1943 until the end of the war.

== Overview ==
The Allies initially believed that the Middle East (Southwest Asia) could become a major operational theatre, because they thought that the Germans might invade the area. This did not materialise, although when Allied forces occupied much of the area, in anticipation of such an invasion, there was fighting against [[Vichy French]] forces in [[Syria-Lebanon campaign|Lebanon and Syria]], and against [[Iraq]] in the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] which ended when Baghdad fell to British forces.

The Italian forces in North Africa greatly outnumbered the British. However, Allied forces were able to not only defend against Italian incursions but also to defeat the defending Italians and take over their colonies in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somaliland]]. By February 1941, Commonwealth forces appeared to be on the verge of overrunning the last Italian forces in Libya, which would have ended Axis control in all of Africa.

While the fighting was taking place in Libya, Axis forces were attacking [[Greece]]. The Allied commander, General [[Archibald Wavell]], was ordered to stop his advance against Libya and send troops to Greece. He disagreed with this decision but followed his orders.

The Allies were unable to stop Greece falling to the Axis forces and before they could retake the initiative in the Western Desert, the German ''[[Afrika Korps]]'' had entered the theatre. It would not be until early in 1943, after another year and a half of hard fighting and mixed fortunes, that the Axis forces would be finally driven out of Libya and the theatre would again become an Allied-controlled backwater.

== Balkans and Greek islands campaign ==
{{Main|Balkans Campaign (World War II)}}
In late 1940, the Italians attacked Greece from Albania in the [[Greco-Italian War]]. Not only did the Greeks stop the attack, they forced the Italians back. Eventually, in the spring of 1941, the Germans [[Battle of Greece|intervened in Greece]]. They also [[invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded Yugoslavia]] concurrently.

The Greeks had been reluctant to allow Commonwealth ground forces into the country, because Britain could not spare enough forces to guarantee victory. They had, however, accepted aid from the RAF in their war with the Italians in Albania. The trigger for Commonwealth forces moving to Greece in large numbers was the entry of German forces into Bulgaria, which made clear the German intent to invade Greece.

Commonwealth forces took position on a defensive line running from north-west to south-east across the northern part of Greece. However, there were critical weaknesses in the defences. The Greek forces in the area were further forward than the Commonwealth forces, and the Greek Government ignored suggestions that they should withdraw to a common line. The Greek forces were thus defeated in detail. There was also a large gap between the left flank of Commonwealth forces and the right flank of the Greek forces in Albania. That was exploited fully by the Germans.

After being expelled from the Greek mainland, Commonwealth forces retreated to Crete. There, the Germans again exploited weaknesses in the defences with a bold invasion plan. In the largest and last German airborne assault, paratroops landed at several points on the island and the [[Battle of Crete]] began. In all but one location, they were cut off and destroyed, and the follow-on seaborne forces were dispersed by the Allied navies. However, that one location was enough, and reinforcements were flown in to the point where the Germans were strong enough to break out and take the rest of the island.

Command in London eventually decided the cause was hopeless, and ordered a withdrawal from [[Sfakia]]. Over the next four nights 16,000 troops were taken off Crete to Egypt. A smaller number were withdrawn on a separate mission from [[Heraklion]], but these ships were attacked en-route by Luftwaffe [[dive bomber]]s and suffered serious losses. On 1 June the remaining 5,000 defenders at Sfakia surrendered, although many took to the hills and caused the German occupation problems for years.

During the evacuation of Crete Admiral [[Andrew Browne Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Andrew Cunningham]] was determined that the "navy must not let the army down", when Mr. Winnie stated their fears that too many ships would be lost, Cunningham said, "It takes three years to build a ship, it takes three centuries to build a tradition."{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Nevertheless, large numbers of Allied soldiers were taken prisoner on Crete.

== East Africa ==

{{main|East African Campaign (World War II)|l1=East African Campaign}}

On 4 August 1940, Italy's forces in [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'', AOI) attempted to conquer [[British Somaliland]]. The Italians took the British colony's capital city of [[Berbera]] on 19 August.  The Italians also staged very minor raids across the Sudanese and Kenyan borders in 1940.

Italian success in East Africa was short-lived.  On 19 January 1941, [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] forces counter-attacked from [[Sudan]] in the north and [[Kenya]] in the south.  On May 6, the capital city of AOI, [[Addis Ababa]], fell.  [[Haile Selassie]] had managed to enter the city on 5 May.  On 18 May, Prince [[Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta]], the Italian Governor-General of AOI, surrendered in [[Amba Alagi]] which all but ended hostilities. Some isolated Italian units fought on.  But, when the Italian forces under General [[Guglielmo Nasi]] in [[Gondar]] surrendered on 27 November, major Italian resistance ended at the hands of the British.

== Middle East campaigns ==
In March 1942 the [[Indian 10th Infantry Division]] was in Iraq. It had fought Iraq, and in the invasions of Syria, Lebanon, and Persia. As its soon to be promoted commander Major-General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William Slim]] wrote: "''We could move we could fight and we had begun to build up that most valuable of all assets a tradition of success. ... it was stimulating to be at what we all felt was a critical spot, waiting for the threatened German invasion of Turkey.''"&lt;ref&gt;''Defeat Into Victory'' by Field Marshal William Slim, Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Southwest Asia]] was destined to remain a strategic backwater for the duration of [[World War II]], in late 1941 and early 1942 the Allies were not certain that it would remain so. Before the turning points of the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] (June 1942 to  February, 1943) and the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] (October to November 1942), the fear was that the Germans might attack the area either through Turkey, or via Cyprus into Lebanon; or through defeating of the [[British 8th Army]] in Egypt. If the anticipated attack came through Turkey or Lebanon, then not only could the [[Axis Powers]] threaten British controlled Egypt and the strategically important [[Suez Canal]] via an advance through Palestine and the [[Sinai Peninsula]], it would also allow the Germans an alternative route to attack the Soviet Union from Southwest Asia north through the USSR's southern frontiers.  In the slightly longer term the British feared independent regimes in the region as well as the possibility that the Germans might follow in [[Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great's]] footsteps and attack [[British India|British controlled India]] from Persia in the west as Japan simultaneously attacked India from the east through [[Burma Campaign|Burma]].

=== Command structure ===
[[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces in the region were for the most part under the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Middle East Command]] based in [[Cairo]]. The exception was Persia which for some of the time came under the command of the [[Commander-in-Chief in India]].

=== British Mandate of Palestine ===
{{main|Bombing of Palestine in World War II}}
Starting in July 1940, the Italian bombings in the [[Mandate Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] were primarily centered on [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Haifa]]. However, many other coastal towns such as [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and [[Jaffa]] also suffered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tel-aviv.millenium.org.il/NR/exeres/A90C2246-AEE0-4273-9EC7-9BD7CAEC145B,frameless.htm?NRMODE=Published The Italian Bombing], at the website of Tel Aviv Municipality (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isracast.com/article.aspx?ID=470&amp;t=Why-Italian-Planes-Bombed-Tel-Aviv? Italian Planes Bomb Tel-Aviv] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921004629/http://www.isracast.com/article.aspx?ID=470&amp;t=Why-Italian-Planes-Bombed-Tel-Aviv%3F |date=2011-09-21 }}, IsraCast.com&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 September 1940, a bombing raid on Tel Aviv caused 137 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Maya Zamir, [http://www.tam.co.il/7_9_2007/magazin1.htm The Day of The bombing], ''[[Tel Aviv Magazine]]'', 7th of September 2007 {{he icon}}  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112084944/http://www.tam.co.il/7_9_2007/magazin1.htm |date=January 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in most of the Arab world, there was no unanimity amongst the Palestinian Arabs as to their position regarding the combatants in WWII. Some signed up for the British army - into the mixed [[Palestine Regiment]] unit, but others saw an Axis victory as their best hope of gaining Arab control of Palestine. Some of the leadership went further, especially the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]], [[Haj Amin Al-Husseini]] (by then settled in Axis occupied Europe), who on November 25, 1941, formally declared ''jihad'' against the Allied Powers. During the war, the British forbade entry of Jews into Palestine escaping Nazi persecution, placing them in detention camps or deporting them to other places such as [[Mauritius]]. However, over 30,000 Palestinian Jews fought for Great Britain during World War II, within the regular British army, [[Palestine Regiment]] and the [[Jewish Brigade]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} David Ben Gurion, leader of the Jewish Agency, which was the mainstream Zionist organization in Palestine, had said "We will fight the White Paper as if there is no war, and fight the war as if there is no White Paper."&lt;ref&gt;Howard Blum, ''The Brigade''. p.5&lt;/ref&gt; By 1940, The Haganah and other underground Jewish militias ordered complete cease fire with the British, in favor of the joint war effort against the Axis, but continued smuggling attempts of Jewish refugees from Iraq and Europe into [[Mandatory Palestine|British Palestine]].

=== Iraq ===
{{main|Anglo-Iraqi War|Farhud}}
Iraq had been officially granted independence by the United Kingdom in 1932, under a number of conditions, including the retention of British military bases. This caused resentment within Iraq and a pro-Axis prime minister, [[Rashid Ali]], assumed control. In early 1941, Ali ordered the occupying British forces to withdraw.

The Middle East Command hastily assembled a formation known as [[Iraqforce]] — which included the [[Indian 10th Infantry Division]] and the [[Arab Legion]] — and it arrived on April 18. There were two main British military bases in Iraq, at [[Basra]] and at [[RAF Habbaniya|Habbaniya]], north east of [[Baghdad]]. On April 30, the Iraqi Army surrounded and besieged the isolated and poorly defended [[Royal Air Force]] base at Habbaniya. Although the base had no offensive aircraft, RAF personnel converted training aircraft to carry weapons, and attacked the Iraqi forces.

Habbaniya was soon relieved by [[Iraqforce]], which defeated the larger but poorly trained Iraqi Army in a series of battles, even though the Iraqis received direct aid from the ''[[Luftwaffe]]''. Iraqforce pressed on from Habbaniya to [[Baghdad]] and then to [[Mosul]]. [[Rashid Ali]] and his supporters fled the country and an [[armistice]] was signed. Prior to the arrival of British forces to Baghdad, the power vacuum erupted into a series of massacres and looting ([[Farhud]]), in which the [[Baghdadi Jews|Baghdadi Jewish community]] was hit particularly hard.

=== Syria and Lebanon ===
{{main|Syria-Lebanon campaign}}

A Luftwaffe aircraft was shot down over Iraq during the advance on Baghdad. Since the nearest Axis bases were on [[Rhodes]], the Allies realised that the plane had refueled in [[Vichy French]] controlled Syria or Lebanon. This confirmed suspicions among the Allies regarding the "armed neutrality" of Vichy territories.

Australian, [[Free French]], British and Indian units invaded Syria and Lebanon from Palestine in the south on 8 June 1941. Vigorous resistance was put up by the Vichy. However, the Allies' better training and equipment, as well as the weight of numbers eventually told against the Axis. Further attacks were launched at the end of June and early July from [[Iraq]] into northern and central Syria by troops from [[Iraqforce]]. By 8 July the whole of north east Syria had been captured and elements of Iraqforce advancing up the river Euphrates were threatening [[Aleppo]] and as a consequence the rear of the Vichy forces defending Beirut from the advance from the south. Negotiations for an armistice were started on 11 July and surrender terms signed on 14 July.

=== Iran ===

{{main|Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran}}

The final major military operation in the war in the Middle East campaign took place shortly thereafter. The [[Soviet Union]] desperately needed supplies for its war against Germany. Supplies were being sent round the [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]] convoy route to [[Murmansk]] and [[Archangel]], but the capacity of that route was limited and subject to enemy action. Supplies were also sent from America to [[Vladivostok]] in Soviet-flagged ships. However, yet more capacity was needed, the obvious answer was to go through [[Iran]]. The [[Shah]] of Iran was deemed as pro-German; he would not allow this free access. Consequently, British and Soviet forces invaded and occupied Iran. The Shah was deposed and his son put on the throne.

== Western Desert Campaign ==
{{main|Western Desert Campaign}}

After the fall of France and before United States land forces entered the war in [[Operation Torch]], the north African campaign in the Sahara desert and Mediterranean coastal plains of Libya and western Egypt was the major land front between Western Allied and Axis forces.

In September 1940, Italian forces stationed in Libya crossed the border and launched an [[Italian invasion of Egypt|invasion into Egypt]]. After advancing to [[Sidi Barrani]] they set up defensive positions in order to regroup and resupply before continuing.

In December, the outnumbered Allied forces launched [[Operation Compass]] which was initially to be a five-day raid against the Italian defensive positions in Egypt.  Ultimately the raid turned into a full-scale counter-offensive against Italian forces in Egypt and Libya.  The operation was more successful than planned and resulted in the capture of the Libyan province of [[Cyrenaica]] and the advance of the Allied forces as far as [[El Agheila]]. Over 100,000 Italian prisoners were taken.

The defeat of Italian forces did not go unnoticed and soon the German Africa Corps (''[[Deutsches Afrikakorps]]''), commanded by [[Erwin Rommel]], were sent in to reinforce the Italians.  Although ordered to simply hold the line, Rommel launched an offensive from El Agheila in March 1941 which, with the exception of [[Siege of Tobruk|Tobruk]], managed to press the Allies beyond [[Sallum|Salum]] on the Egyptian border, effectively putting both sides back at their approximate pre-war positions.

During the following stalemate, the Allied forces were reinforced and reorganised as the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]]. In addition to British formations, the army was made up of divisions from the armies of several countries: the [[Australian Army]], the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]], the [[South African Army]], and the [[New Zealand Army]]. There was also a brigade of [[Free French]] under [[Marie-Pierre Koenig]]. In November 1941 the new formation launched a new offensive, [[Operation Crusader]], and recaptured almost all of the territory recently acquired by Rommel and lifting the [[Siege of Tobruk]]. Once again, the [[front line]] was at El Agheila.

After receiving supplies from [[Tripoli]], Rommel was able to push the Allies back to Gazala, west of Tobruk. After a period when both sides were rebuilding their strength, the Axis forces defeated the Allies in May 1942 at the [[Battle of Gazala]], capturing Tobruk, and drove them back to past the border of Egypt. Deep into Egypt, the Axis forces were halted in July at the [[First Battle of El Alamein]].

At this point General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Harold Alexander]] took over as commander-in-Chief [[Middle East Command]] and Lieutenant-General [[Bernard Montgomery]] took over the Eighth Army under him. After victory in the defensive battle of [[Battle of Alam Halfa|Alam Halfa]] in late August and early September, the Eighth Army went on the offensive in October 1942 and decisively defeated the Axis at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Second El Alamein]]. The Axis forces were pursued through Libya and the capital Tripoli was captured by Eighth Army in January 1943.

After the advance of the Eighth  Army into eastern [[Tunisia]] in early 1943, [[18th Army Group]] was formed to control Eighth Army and [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] which was attacking Tunisia from the west after the successful Allied [[Operation Torch]] in November 1942. Strategic command of Eighth Army thus passed from C-in-C [[Middle East Command]] to [[Dwight Eisenhower]], the Joint Allied Commander of [[AFHQ]], under which 18th Army Group came.

== Command Structure ==
{{main|Middle East Command}}

The British '''Middle East Command''' was based in [[Cairo]] with responsibility for Commonwealth operations in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], and also those in [[East Africa]], [[Iran|Persia]], and the [[Balkans]], including [[Greece]]. In August 1942 forces in Persia and Iran (known as [[Paiforce]]) were detached and brought under the separate, newly formed [[Persia and Iraq Command]] under [[General (United_Kingdom)|General]] [[Henry Maitland Wilson|Sir Henry Maitland Wilson]] (the post having been turned down by Auchinleck, the outgoing Middle East Command C-in-C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Compton |last=Mackenzie |authorlink=Compton Mackenzie |title=Eastern Epic: September 1939 – March 1943 Defence |volume=I |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |location=London |year=1951 |oclc=1412578 |page=591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Motul de San José''' is an ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site located just north of [[Lake Petén Itzá]] in the [[Petén Basin]] region of the southern Maya lowlands. It is a few kilometres from the modern village of [[San José, El Petén|San José]], in [[Guatemala]]'s northern [[Departments of Guatemala|department]] of [[Petén (department)|Petén]]. A medium-sized civic-ceremonial centre, it was an important political and economic centre during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic]] period (AD&amp;nbsp;650&amp;ndash;950).&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2000, p.773. Halperin 2008, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was first settled between 600 and 300 BC, in the latter portion of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle Preclassic]] period, when it most likely was a fairly small site. This [[Maya city]] then had a long and continuous occupational history until the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Postclassic]], up to around AD 1250, with peaks in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Preclassic]] and Late Classic periods.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty 2004, pp.37-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Motul de San José had begun to refer to [[Tikal]] as its overlord in the late 4th century AD; by the 7th century it had switched its allegiance to [[Calakmul]], Tikal's great rival, before returning its allegiance to Tikal in the early 8th century. In the late 8th century Motul de San José appears to have been conquered by [[Dos Pilas]], capital of the [[Petexbatún]] kingdom.

Most natural resources were easily available in the immediate vicinity of the city. The nearby port at La Trinidad de Nosotros was an important hub for the import of exotic goods and export of local products such as [[chert]] and [[Maya ceramics|ceramics]]. Other goods not immediately available were likely to have been provided by the city’s satellite sites. The local area provided a number of different soils suitable for varied agricultural use, and the port at La Trinidad de Nosotros provided the city with freshwater products such as [[turtle]]s, [[crocodile]]s and [[freshwater mollusc]]s. [[Capreolinae|Deer]] were hunted locally and provided an important source of [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]] for the upper class, while [[freshwater snail]]s were the main source of protein for commoners.

Motul de San José has been identified as the source of Ik-style polychrome ceramics bearing painted scenes of the Late Classic Maya aristocracy involved in a variety of courtly activities.&lt;ref name="ReentsBudetet"&gt;Reents-Budet et al 2007, pp.1417-1418.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ik-style was characterised by hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour, scenes with dancers wearing masks, and the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life. The city was the capital of a polity that included various satellite sites of varying importance, including a port on the shore of [[Lake Petén Itzá]].

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Location==
Motul de San José is located {{convert|3|km|mi}} from the north shore of [[Lake Petén Itzá]], in the centre of the department of El Petén.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2000, p.773.&lt;/ref&gt; The nearest town is [[Flores, El Petén|Flores]], {{convert|10.5|km|mi}} to the south, on the other side of the lake. The nearest villages are San José, {{convert|5|km|mi}} away, and [[San Andrés, El Petén|San Andrés]], {{convert|6.5|km|mi}} away, both are to the south of the site, on the northern shore of the lake. The archaeological site is connected to Nuevo San José, a northern expansion of San José, by a dirt road.&lt;ref name="Foiaset"&gt;Foias et al 1998a, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; It lies among land that has been cleared of forest within the last century and is now used to plant maize and graze cattle.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_b"&gt;Moriarty 2004, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Motul de San José lies on a [[limestone]] [[plateau]] at the northern edge of the [[Fault (geology)|fault]] depression that underlies the central lakes of the Petén Basin.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty 2004, pp.23, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The local [[topography]] consists of ridges, generally running east-west or northeast-southwest alternating with lower-lying areas with [[clay]] soils. These low-lying areas tend to feed into [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage systems]] flowing into either Lake Petén Itzá itself or into the Akte River. The Kantetul River is a seasonal watercourse with its origin {{convert|5|km|mi}} to the northeast of the site and flowing westwards into the Akte River, passing {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the site core.&lt;ref name="Moriarty"&gt;Moriarty 2004, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; The Akte River in turn flows west into the [[San Pedro River (Guatemala)|San Pedro River]], which flows northwest into [[Mexico]] where it joins the [[Usumacinta River]] and ultimately empties into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. A mixture of ancient and modern [[Terrace (agriculture)|agricultural terraces]] line the riverbank, {{convert|2|km|mi}} north of the site core.&lt;ref&gt;Emery 1998, pp.63-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Access to water was crucial for Maya cities, since much of the Maya lowlands have been described as a seasonal desert due to the combination of a prolonged [[dry season]] lasting between four and six months together with the limestone geography that makes surface water scarce.&lt;ref&gt;Drew 2002, p.239.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the Maya greatly preferred water to land transport and used canoes to trade extensively by river and sea, and access to river routes connected cities to extensive trade routes.&lt;ref&gt;Abbas Shatto 1998, pp.21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Guatemala-Peten-around-Flores.png|thumb|left|400px|Map of Lake Petén Itzá, showing the location of Motul de San José near the northern shore]]
Motul de San José lies within a dense cluster of smaller satellite sites.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty 2004, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; It is {{convert|32|km|mi}} to the southwest of the major [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]] ruins of [[Tikal]].&lt;ref&gt;Motul de San José Archaeological Project 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The site is about {{convert|275|km|mi}} north of [[Guatemala City]]. The ruins are located on a hill about {{convert|180|m|ft}} [[above mean sea level]].&lt;ref name="Foiaset" /&gt;

The site forms part of the Motul [[ecology|Ecological]] Park (''Parque Ecológico Motul'' in Spanish), which is administered by  ''[[Instituto de Antropología e Historia]]'' (IDAEH), the Guatemalan Institute of [[Anthropology]] and [[History]]), the [[University of San Carlos of Guatemala]] (USAC) and the local communities of San José and Nuevo San José.&lt;ref&gt;Foias et al 1998a, p.9. Deter-Wolf et al 1999, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; The park covers an area of approximately {{convert|2.2|km2|sqmi}}.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty 2004, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emblem glyph==
[[File:Motul de San José Emblem Glyph.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Glyph from Yaxchilan Lintel 15 meaning "Lady of Ik"&lt;ref&gt;FAMSI.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Maya cities and kingdoms in the Classic Period were identified in hieroglyphic texts by a distinctive [[Maya script#Emblem glyphs|emblem glyph]]; they are essentially royal titles composed of three distinct parts – the [[glyph]]s representing ''k'uhul'' and ''[[Ajaw|ajau]]'' (meaning "divine" and "lord") followed by the name of the polity this person ruled over.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; The decipherment of emblem glyphs was crucial to the interpreting the political makeup of Classic Period Maya civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emblem glyph of Motul de San José contains the main sign ''ik'', "breath" or "wind". It is found on monuments and ceramics from the 8th and 9th centuries. A vessel bearing this emblem and depicting king Lamaw Ek' was found as far away as [[Altar de Sacrificios]]. Analysis has revealed that it was manufactured in Motul de San José, indicating some form of interaction between these distant sites.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp209-10. Reents-Budet et al 2007, p.1419.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{Maya civilization}}
The majority of basic natural resources were readily available in the immediate vicinity of the city, with local soils being suitable for the production of maize and mixed crops to support the local populace.&lt;ref name="Emery"&gt;Emery 2003, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt; The subsidiary site of La Trinidad de Nosotros, located on the shore of Lake Petén Itzá some {{convert|2.6|km|mi}} southeast of the site core, appears to have been an important port for the import and export of goods to and from Motul de San José.&lt;ref name="Emery_b"&gt;Emery 2003, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; Food resources not available in the immediate vicinity of the city were probably provided by the satellite sites dispersed at some distance from the site core, and La Trinidad is likely to have played an important part in supplying exotic goods to the city as well as freshwater foodstuffs such as crocodiles, fish and turtles.&lt;ref name="Emery" /&gt; [[Chert]] nodules were locally available from the first ridges to the north of the lake.&lt;ref name="Moriarty" /&gt; A chert workshop has been discovered in the northern sector of Motul de San José.&lt;ref name="Foias"&gt;Foias 2003, p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; Ceramic figurines were produced in the Acropolis palace complex in Group C and also in a medium-sized palace complex in Group B, an elite plaza in Group E and also in two elite plazas in the northern part of the site.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2003, pp.23, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The small satellite site of Chak Maman Tok' several kilometers to the southwest of Motul de San José, appears to have been an important centre for the production of chert tools, with only a few other centres within the Maya lowlands manufacturing chert on such a scale. Although very small, Chak Maman Tok' probably played a major part within the economy of the Motul de San José polity.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_l"&gt;Moriarty &amp; Castellanos 2007, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in architectural style between elite residential complexes and in the activities carried out at them suggest that the aristocracy of Motul de San José was divided into several distinct classes, including the royal family resident in Group C, royal [[courtier]]s and low to middle rank nobles.&lt;ref name="Foias" /&gt;

The Kantetul River, although now seasonal, is reported to have been a navigable water channel until relatively recently. During the height of Motul de San José's power, it may have provided an important link to the San Pedro River, a significant [[Trade in Maya civilization|trade route]] in ancient times.&lt;ref name="Moriarty" /&gt;

==''Ik'' style ceramics==
Motul de San José is possibly the source of the so-called "Ik-style" painted [[Maya ceramics|polychrome ceramics]], a theory that has recently received additional support from archaeological excavations at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty 2004, p.21. Reents-Budet et al 2007, p.1417.&lt;/ref&gt; These ceramic vessels, including finely painted plates and cylindrical vessels, were first associated with the then-unidentified site of Ik in the 1970s by the Emblem Glyph included in the hieroglyphic texts on them. The confirmation of Motul de San José as Ik came from investigations carried out from 1998 to 2004.&lt;ref name="ReentsBudetet" /&gt; Chemical analysis of Ik-style ceramics have revealed that they were not only produced in workshops in Motul itself but also in satellite sites in the vicinity.&lt;ref name="Reents-Budet et al 2007, p.1420"&gt;Reents-Budet et al 2007, p.1420.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ik-style ceramic corpus includes a set of features such as [[Maya script|hieroglyphs]] painted in a pink or pale red colour and scenes with dancers wearing masks. One of the most distinctive features is the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life, something that is very rare in Mesoamerican art. The corpus is represented by more than 30 intact vessels, the majority of unknown provenance, which have been compared to ceramic fragments recovered from Motul de San José and its satellite sites. The subject matter of the vessels includes courtly life from the [[Petén Basin|Petén region]] in the 8th century AD, such as diplomatic representations, feasting, [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|bloodletting]], scenes of warriors and the [[sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifice]] of prisoners of [[Maya warfare|war]].&lt;ref name="ReentsBudetet" /&gt;

The variations in artistic style and chemical composition of the Ik-style ceramics suggests that they were produced in a number of workshops local to the Motul de San José area. They have been subdivided into five types, four from Motul de San José itself and one from one of its satellite sites. There are also various lower-quality examples that are presumed to have been manufactured in sites of lesser importance within the Motul de San José polity. The Ik-style ceramics are believed to have been produced in the period from 740&amp;ndash;800 AD. In spite of differences, all the Ik-style ceramics are thought to have been made within a network of allied workshops dedicated to producing vessels for use in the banquets of the aristocracy of Motul de San José and of the [[petty nobility]] of the capital's satellites.&lt;ref name="ReentsBudetet" /&gt; The ceramics were distributed widely in the Maya region as gifts in order to seal alliances between the elites of various Maya kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 1999, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular note is that chemical analysis of ceramic fragments has revealed that the very same workshops not only produced the highest-quality Ik-style polychrome ceramics but also general low-quality ceramics for household use. High quality Ik-style ceramics made at Motul de San José have been excavated from across the Maya region, including [[Tikal]] and [[Uaxactún]] to the northeast of the city, [[Copán]] far to the south, and [[Altar de Sacrificios]], [[Tamarindito]] and [[Seibal]], in western Petén.&lt;ref&gt;Reents-Budet et al 2007, pp.1418-1419. Valdés et al 1995, p.421.&lt;/ref&gt;

A particularly rare feature found on Motul de San José ceramics is the so-called X-ray style, showing a figure wearing a mask but also portraying his face underneath it. All the other representations using this rare style are depicted on Late Classic sculptures at sites with which it is known that Motul de San José had contact at this time, including Dos Pilas, [[Machaquila]], Tikal and Yaxchilan.&lt;ref name="Reents-Budet et al 2007, p.1420"/&gt; This X-ray style has been found on at least nine painted vessels from Motul de San José and is also used on the west side of Stela 2.&lt;ref name="VelasqeezGarcia"&gt;Velásqeez García 2007, pp.15-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occupation and diet==
Motul de San José was occupied from the Middle [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Preclassic]] right through to the Early [[Postclassic]]. However, the height of the city's occupation was the Late [[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic period|Classic]].&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty 2005, p.440.&lt;/ref&gt; Settlement density averages 250 structures per square kilometer (650 structures per square mile) in the site's monumental core, 125 structures per square kilometer (325 structures per square mile) in the city's suburban area and 79 structures per square kilometer (205 structures per square mile) in the site's periphery.&lt;ref&gt;Emery 2003, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Motul de San José's likely resource catchment zone probably extended between {{convert|5|and|7|km|mi}} around the site core and included a number of satellite sites including Kantetul, La Trinidad de Nosotros, Akte, Buena Vista, Chachaklum and Chakokot. This region also includes two major water sources in the form of Lake Péten Itzá to the south and the Kantetul river {{convert|2|km|mi}} to the north. The area around the city included a variety of soils suitable for agriculture, with 20% of this being very fertile soil highly suited to agriculture, just over 50% of the area was very fertile but required high maintenance (consisting of either fertilization or [[crop rotation]]) and 14% being low fertility soil consisting of lowland [[clay]] and suitable only for [[maize]] or being left unfarmed. Soil analysis has revealed that maize was not only grown in peripheral areas but also close to residential areas throughout Motul de San José.&lt;ref&gt;Emery 2003, pp.36-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological investigations have revealed that the diet of the inhabitants of Motul de San José included [[dog]]s (''Canis familiaris''), [[turtle]]s including [[pond slider]]s (''Trachemys scripta'') and [[Mesoamerican river turtle]]s (''Dermatemys mawii''), [[freshwater snail]]s (mostly ''[[Pomacea flagellata]]'' but also jute snails (''[[Pachychilus]] spp.'')), [[white-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus''), [[red brocket]] (''Mazama americana'', a species of small deer), [[white-lipped peccary]] (''Tayassu pecari''), [[rabbit]]s (''[[Sylvilagus]] spp.''), [[lowland paca]]s (''Cuniculus paca''), [[Central American agouti]] (''Dasyprocta punctata'') and [[nine-banded armadillo]]s (''Dasypus novemcinctus'').&lt;ref&gt;Emery 1998, pp.66-68, 71. Foias 2000, p.777. Emery 2003, p.38. Thornton &amp; Emery 2007, p.1463.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the dog had been domesticated by the Late Classic Maya so the majority of [[protein]] in the [[Maya cuisine|diet]] of the inhabitants came from hunting and fishing within the catchment area around the city. The most common food animals were the white-tailed deer, [[Freshwater bivalves|river clam]] and river turtle.&lt;ref&gt;Emery 2003, p.38.&lt;/ref&gt; Some animal remains were recovered that were clearly associated with elite status occupation, such as those of the [[jaguar]], the [[ocelot]] or other small feline and the [[crocodile]] (''crocodilus spp.''). These latter three appear more related to ritual and economic activity than nutritional needs. Freshwater snails were more an ingredient in the diet of lower status families while deer remains were associated with the elite residents of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Emery 1998, pp.67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Motul de San José and its most important satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros, the majority of remains from Trinidad were from aquatic species, while at Motul de San José the majority were from terrestrial species. 10% of animal remains from Motul had been modified to form artefacts, compared with only 4% of animal remains at Trinidad. Artefact remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros were more likely to be waste products from artefact manufacture while at Motul de San José they were more likely to be artefacts at the end of their usable life. Aquatic animal products arriving at Motul de San José were far more likely to be consumed by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton &amp; Emery 2007, pp.1466-1469.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Preclassic Period===

====Middle Preclassic====
Motul de San José was first settled between 600 and 300 BC, in the latter portion of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle Preclassic]] period, when it was probably a fairly small site. At this time some of its satellite sites were also settled, including La Trinidad de Nosotros and Buena Vista, both of which would have been small villages at this time, and they may have been settled even earlier in the Middle Preclassic, between 800 and 600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty 2004, pp.37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Late Preclassic====
Although investigation of Preclassic remains is difficult at Motul de San José due to the overlying Late Classic construction, it is evident that the site experienced major growth during the Late Preclassic (300 BC&amp;ndash;AD 300) and became a sizeable centre. At roughly the same time, most of the major structures were built at Akte, and Chakokot experienced its earliest occupation during the Late Preclassic. In contrast, Buena Vista appears to have been lightly occupied. La Trinidad de Nosotros also underwent major expansion in the Late Preclassic and became larger and more important than Motul de San José, with its architectural layout being finalised in this period – later Classic period construction was superimposed upon pre-existing Late Preclassic structures.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_a"&gt;Moriarty 2004, p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classic Period===
Although Motul de San José had begun to refer to Tikal as its overlord in the late 4th century,&lt;ref name="Drew"&gt;Drew 1999, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; by the 7th century various hieroglyphic texts mention that it was under the dominion of [[Calakmul]], Tikal's greatest enemy, before again coming under the power of Tikal in the early 8th century.&lt;ref name="ReentsBudetet_a"&gt;Reents-Budet et al 2007, p.1421.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early Classic====
Early Classic ceramic finds are scarce at Motul de San José and those that have been found were a minor component in mixed fill deposits. This suggests that Motul de San José was largely abandoned in the Early Classic. The best examples of Early Classic pottery come from outside of Motul de San José itself, with several complete ceramic vessels being recovered during the construction of a modern language school in Trinidad de Nosotros and some fragments of Early Classic pottery being retrieved from a looted chultun at Wakutal.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_a" /&gt;

In the late 4th century Motul de San José began to refer to Tikal as its overlord.&lt;ref name="Drew" /&gt;

====Late Classic====
Motul de San José experienced its second major peak in occupation during the Late Classic period, between AD 600 and AD 830. Most of the major architecture at the site was built during this surge in activity and the city reached its maximum size. Motul de San José became one of the three most important cities around Lake Petén Itzá and was approximately the same size as [[Tayasal]], while it was slightly smaller than [[Nixtun Ch'ich']]. There was renewed growth in the city's satellite sites, Chakokot reached its peak population and most of its residential complexes were built in the Late Classic. Buena Vista experienced only light occupation at this time. Major construction work took place at Akte including the building of the principal platform and its causeway. It also appears that the rulers of Akte erected several stelae. La Trinidad de Nosotros took on its final form and most of its major architecture was built at this time including the [[Mesoamerican ballcourt]], the major residential complexes, four plazas and the port facilities.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_a" /&gt;

In the 8th century AD the city had important relationships with Maya cities to the southwest, especially in the [[Petexbatún]] region, and on the [[Pasión River|Pasión]] and [[Usumacinta River|Usumacinta]] rivers, including Seibal (on the Pasión), Altar de Sacrificios (near where the Pasión becomes the Usumacinta), and [[Dos Pilas]], [[Aguateca]], [[Tamarindito]], [[Arroyo de Piedra]] and [[Cueva de Sangre]] (all five in the Petexbatún region).&lt;ref&gt;Reents-Budet et al 2007, p.1420. Velásqeez García 2007, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the widespread distribution of Ik-style ceramics in elite tombs at sites in the Petexbatún region may be linked to the military defeat of Motul de San José by Dos Pilas, with these high quality ceramics forming a part of the tribute payment made to the Petexbatún kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Velásqeez García 2007, p.23. Foias 2003, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; After its defeat at the hands of the Petexbatún kingdom, Motul de San José no longer erected sculpted stelae but the history of the site continued to be recorded to a certain extent in texts on Ik-style ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2003, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Politics=====
[[File:Yaxchilan lintel 15 detail.jpg|thumb|right|Lady Wak Tuun of Motul de San José married Yaxun B'alam IV of [[Yaxchilán]]. Here she is depicted performing a [[bloodletting in Mesoamerica|bloodletting rite]] in AD 755.

In the Late Classic period Motul de San José was located between two mutually hostile powers, the great city of Tikal to the north and the breakaway kingdom of Petexbatún to the southwest, which had become a vassal of Tikal's implacable enemy [[Calakmul]]. In Mesoamerica, such border states as Motul de San José became centres of political activity as they tried to manipulate the shifting political fortunes of their neighbours to their own advantage. This seems to be the case at Motul de San José with its rich ceramic tradition being a testament to the politically motivated banqueting that took place in the city. In the 8th century, although Motul de San José was the capital of the Ik polity, the aristocracy of its satellite sites wielded great power and were able to challenge their own position within the political hierarchy of the state while remaining subordinate to the ruling lord of the capital city.&lt;ref name="ReentsBudetet_a" /&gt;

During the 7th century AD, Motul de San José is recorded in hieroglyphic inscriptions as being a vassal of Calakmul. By the early 8th century the city had switched its allegiance to [[Jasaw Chan K'awiil I]], king of Tikal, then falling under the power of Petexbatún, itself a vassal of Calakmul, in the middle of the 8th century, before once again switching its allegiance to Tikal. In 711, [[Jasaw Chan K'awiil I]], Lord of [[Tikal]], was recorded as overlord of Motul, perhaps reflecting Tikal's traditional overlordship of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, pp. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of these shifting alliances, Motul de San José acted with a degree of independence and was a powerful kingdom in the 8th century AD, with its ruler using the ''kaloomte'' title given to high kings. The city's rulers became very successful on the political scene in the wider Maya region, with the use of politically motivated feasting, war, economics and political marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Reents-Budet et al 2007, pp.1421-1422. Velásquez García 2007, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a glyphic record that sometime before 731 a lord of Motul was captured by a lord (Ruler B) of [[Machaquilá]].&lt;ref name="Mathews"&gt;Mathews &amp; Willey 1991, p.63.&lt;/ref&gt; In 740, Machaquila attacked Motul de San José.&lt;ref name="ReentsBudetet_a" /&gt; Hieroglyphic Stairway 3 at [[Dos Pilas]] records that in 745 a lord of Motul was captured by K'awiil Chan K'inich of Dos Pilas.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the 8th century AD, Motul de San José was closely allied with the important city of Yaxchilan on the Usumacinta River, as demonstrated by the fact that the king of Yaxchilan [[Yaxun B'alam IV]] ("Bird Jaguar IV") who ruled from 752 to 768, took two wives from Motul de San José. They are named in inscriptions at Yaxchilan as Lady Wak Tuun and Lady Wak Jalam Chan Ajaw.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 129. Tuszyńska 2009, p.9. Tuszyńska argues that these two ladies named at Yaxchilan may not have been wives of Yaxun B'alam IV at all but may have been the wives of subordinate lords.&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Wak Jalam Chan Ajaw is shown preparing her husband for a battle that took place in 755 on Yaxchilan Lintel 41, now in the [[British Museum]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the alliance with Yaxchilan may date further back to the early 8th century since Yaxchilan Lintel 25 (dedicated in AD 723) used the so-called X-ray style of imagery that is closely associated with the Motul de San José polity.&lt;ref&gt;Velásqeez García 2007, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, relations with Yaxchilan were not always peaceful and Hieroglyphic Stairway 5 at Yaxchilan records that Itzamnaaj B'alam III of Yaxchilan defeated the lord of Motul some time in the latter part of the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

An Ik-style vessel possesses a hieroglyphic text declaring that it was the property of Chuy-ti Chan, the son of Sak Muwaan, divine lord of Motul de San Jose who ruled between AD 700 and 726. Chuy-ti Chan is described as an artist and ballplayer and appears to have been appointed as an ambassador to the site known as Maan.&lt;ref name="ReentsBudetet_b"&gt;Reents-Budet et al 2007, p.1419.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two rulers feature prominently on Ik-style ceramics, they are named as Yajawte' K'inich and Lamaw Ek'. Lamaw Ek' appears to have ruled directly after Yajawte' K'inich but was not his son, on one vessel his father is given the title ''k'uhul Ik'nal'', a "divine noble of Motul de San José" but not the king (whose title is ''k'uhul [[ajaw]]'' or "divine lord"). Each of these two rulers had his own dedicated master painter. The artist of Yajawte' K'inich is named on the ceramics as T'uubal Ajaw, Lord of T'uubal. This latter site, T'uubal, is thought to be located in Petén somewhere between [[Tikal]] and [[Naranjo]]. Yajawte' K'inich is depicted on one Ik-style vessel wearing a mask and dancing, he is also depicted on Stelae 2 and 6 in the site core. Yajawte' K'inich is recorded on one vessel as possibly having died in AD 755.&lt;ref&gt;Reents-Budet et al 2007, pp.1418-1419.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the painter who produced the ceramic vessels for Lamaw Ek' is only partially deciphered, as well as painting the vessel that possibly records the death of Yajawte' K'inich, he also painted a vessel recording the death of Lamaw Ek' as having taken place in AD 779.&lt;ref name="ReentsBudetet_b" /&gt;

====Terminal Classic====
Motul de San José underwent a major decline in population at the end of the Classic Period, between AD 830 and AD 1000, and construction also suffered. Terminal Classic ceramics are common but limited to the major centres of Motul de San José itself and its principal satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros. Although it declined, construction did not halt.  Occupation at Group D in the site core continued while Late Classic structures at La Trinidad de Nosotros were modified in the Terminal Classic. There is little evidence for Terminal Classic occupation at the smaller satellite sites.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_c"&gt;Moriarty 2004, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt;

An inscription dating to AD 830 mentions the last known ruler of Machaquilá, which may be evidence of a long-standing relationship between the two sites.&lt;ref&gt;Culbert 1996, p.63.&lt;/ref&gt; If this is the case, then Machaquilá appears to have been the dominant city out of the two.&lt;ref name="Mathews" /&gt; [[Seibal]] Stela 10, dating to roughly 849 AD, has an inscription naming Kan Ek' as ruler of Motul de San José, which is recorded as being one of the four paramount polities in the mid-9th century (ca. 849), along with [[Calakmul]], [[Tikal]] and [[Seibal]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, pp. 18, 227. Foias 2003, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Itza migration=====

It has been suggested that [[Itza]] Maya from Motul de San José began the [[Maya collapse|northward migration of Maya peoples]] to the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] at the end of the Classic Period. Classic period stelae at the site refer to the ''King of the Itzá'', demonstrating that the Itza were already in the Petén region at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Drew 1999, p.373.&lt;/ref&gt; The nearby village of San José, on the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, is one of the last Itzá communities in Petén.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_b" /&gt;

===Postclassic Period===
The full extent of occupation and activity in the Motul de San José area is not well understood for the Postclassic Period. It is known that there was a moderate occupation of the area during the Early Postclassic period, between AD 1000 and AD 1250. Early Postclassic construction and ceramics have been identified at Motul de San José and all of its satellite sites, but construction was small scale and distribution of pottery was limited. La Trinidad de Nosotros was apparently a small village at this time and has produced some of the best examples of Early Postclassic ceramics.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_c" /&gt;

There is little evidence of occupation in the Motul de San José area during the Late Postclassic, from AD 1250 to AD 1697. It is possible that La Trinidad de Nosotros was Xililchi, a settlement visited by [[conquistador]] [[Martín de Ursúa]] after the fall of the Itza capital [[Tayasal|Noj Petén]] to the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] in 1697, but no Late Postclassic remains have yet been identified by archaeologists.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_c" /&gt;

===Modern history===
It is likely that the satellite site of Akte was the ruin that Spanish friar Andrés de Avendaño referred to as ''Tanxulukmul'' in early 1695.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1998, pp. 190, 471n15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Teoberto Maler]] visited Motul de San José in May 1895, and described one of the stelae in his report ''Explorations in the Department of Peten, Guatemala'', published by the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] of [[Harvard University]] in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr 1989, pp.32, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Graham and Arlen Chase have separately mapped portions of the site core.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 1998, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the establishment of the Motul Ecological Park, the site was used for agriculture, specifically the cultivation of [[maize]]. The site has been damaged several times by wildfires caused by uncontrolled stubble burning in 1986, 1987 and again in 1998. This last fire badly damaged the [[Stele|stelae]] in the site core.&lt;ref&gt;Foias et al 1998a, p.9. Moriarty 2004, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the mayor of San José oversaw the improvement of the road to Motul de San José, which involved surfacing the road with gravel and opened the archaeological site to easier access, resulting in increased tourism at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Deter-Wolf et al 1999, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Proyecto Arqueológico Motul de San José (Motul de San José Archaeological Project) has been investigating Motul de San José and its satellites from 1998 to 2008, under the direction of Antonia Foias of [[Williams College]] and Kitty Emery of the [[Florida Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref&gt;Halperin 2008, p.114. Motul de San José Archaeological Project 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The core of the satellite site of Akte was mapped in 2002 and Trinidad de Nosotros was investigated by the project in 2003.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_g"&gt;Moriarty 2004, p.33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site description==
[[Image:Motul de San José 2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The summit of one of the larger pyramids of Group C, built with thin, flat stones, an architectural style that probably dates it to the Terminal Classic&lt;ref name="Foias_a" /&gt;]]

Around 230 structures have been mapped in an area covering {{convert|2|km2|sqmi}}, however, the total area occupied by the city was probably much greater than this.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2004. Moriarty 2004, p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; The total size of Motul de San José is estimated at {{convert|4.18|km2|sqmi}}, with only about a third of this having been mapped.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_e"&gt;Moriarty 2004, p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremonial centre of the city covers an area of {{convert|0.4|km2|sqmi}}, an area which encompasses more than 144 structures including a sizeable palace, 6 stelae, 33 plazas of widely differing sizes, and various temples and elite residential areas. Further residential areas of the city cover an additional {{convert|1.2|km2|sqft}}, which includes both elite and commoner residences, with outlying settlements located for several kilometers to the north and east,&lt;ref&gt;Foias et al 1998b, p.76. Moriarty 2004, p.30. Moriarty 2005, p.440.&lt;/ref&gt; with one residential group associated with agricultural terraces being situated 2&amp;nbsp;km to the north of the site.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2000, p.777.&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 33 plaza groups have been mapped at Motul de San José.&lt;ref&gt;Foias et al 1998a, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2003, around 1,800 fragments of figurines had been excavated from the site, its periphery and its satellites, with 239 of these being either heads or complete figurines.&lt;ref&gt;Halperin 2009, pp.1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site can be generally divided into three broad areas, the site core, a North Zone and an East Zone. The North Zone is separated from the site core by a wide depression containing clay soil that may have served as a reservoir for the city. Several quarries have been identified on the northern and southern edges of this depression.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_d"&gt;Moriarty 2004, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major architecture can be divided into five groups, labelled A to E.&lt;ref name="Foias_a" /&gt; Each of these groups has at least one pyramid and various palace type structures.&lt;ref name="Foias_a" /&gt; The major residential complexes of the site are found in Groups A, B and D, not including the royal palace in Group C.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_d" /&gt; The major architectural groups are divided by lower lying areas that may have been used for [[intensive farming|intensive agriculture]].&lt;ref name="Foiaset_b"&gt;Foias et al 1998a, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; The urban area of the site extends for {{convert|1.2|km|m}} around the site core, with this area having been continuously occupied with a full range of structures from elite down to commoner in status.&lt;ref name="Emery_a"&gt;Emery 2003, p.34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two distinct architectural styles date to the last period of the site's occupation in the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Foias_a" /&gt; One uses well-carved stone blocks for construction and is possibly earlier than the second style, which is believed to date to the Terminal Classic and uses thin, flat stones.&lt;ref name="Foias_a" /&gt;

===Architectural groups===
====Group A====
[[File:Motul de San José 03.JPG|thumb|right|Looted pyramid in Group A]]
Group A is the largest group west of the site core. The group includes a {{convert|5.5|m|ft|adj=on}} tall pyramid, severely damaged by looters' pits, with one in the summit and one each on the north, east, south and west sides. IDAEH has since refilled all five pits. Six large rectangular palace-type structures are situated to the west of this pyramid, measuring up to {{convert|5|m|ft}} high. A plaza is formed in Group A by the pyramid on the east side and a palace on the west side, accessed from the plaza via a stairway. Southeast of the palace is another plaza surrounded on three sides by palace-type structures.&lt;ref name="Foiaset_a"&gt;Foias et al 1998a, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Group B====
[[File:Motul de San José 11.JPG|thumb|right|Pyramid in Group B]]
Group B includes a {{convert|7.7|m|ft|adj=on}} high pyramid located about {{convert|90|m|ft}} south of a palace complex laid out around two small plazas.&lt;ref name="Foiaset_a" /&gt; The main complex in Group B closely resembles a complex at [[Dos Pilas]] in the [[Petexbatún]] region.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_d" /&gt; The pyramid has been looted, with the looters' pits having been refilled by IDAEH. The highest structure in the palace complex measures {{convert|4.5|m|ft}} high and is on the south side of the west plaza, its stairways stylistically resemble stairways from the Petexbatún.&lt;ref&gt;Foias et al 1998a, p.10. Moriarty 2004, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; The palace complex has been looted, with one of the smaller structures around the east plaza having been completely destroyed.&lt;ref name="Foiaset_a" /&gt;

A low wall runs north for {{convert|120|m|ft}} from the northeast corner of the east plaza, it measures between {{convert|0.3|and|0.5|m|in}} high and {{convert|0.5|m|in}} wide. The wall ends in a platform supporting several structures, it may have divided different parts of the site or marked the edge of an avenue.&lt;ref name="Foiaset_a" /&gt;

To the north of Group B are several smaller groups of structures.&lt;ref name="Foiaset_a" /&gt; They consist of residential complexes laid out around small plazas and their occupation was limited purely to the Late Classic period.&lt;ref&gt;Deter-Wolf &amp; Charland 1998, pp.35-36.&lt;/ref&gt; Stela 2 is situated on a low platform to the west of the main pyramid.&lt;ref name="Foiaset_a" /&gt;

====Group C====
Group C is the principal group at Motul de San José.&lt;ref name="Foias_a" /&gt; It includes the Main Plaza, which is surrounded by pyramids and palaces.&lt;ref name="Foias_a" /&gt; The tallest pyramid is {{convert|20|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_d" /&gt; The three largest pyramids in Group C belong to the architectural style possibly dating to the Terminal Classic, being built of thin, flat stones.&lt;ref name="Foias_a" /&gt; Excavations have revealed that Group C was occupied from around 300 BC, in the Late Preclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Emery &amp; Higginbotham 1998, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Main Plaza''' in Group C measures approximately {{convert|100|by|200|m|ft}} and is bordered by the Acropolis on the north and west sides, twin pyramids on the east side and the South Pyramid on the south side.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2000, p.775. Foias et al 1998a, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest plaza at Motul de San José, encompassing an area greater than {{convert|11000|m2|sqft}}.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_e" /&gt; There are five stelae in the plaza commemorating Classic Period rulers, they have all been badly damaged by [[bushfires]].&lt;ref name="Foias_a" /&gt; On the west side of the plaza is a lower pyramid, measuring {{convert|7.8|m|ft}} high, that has been damaged by looters. A badly eroded stela was found close to this pyramid, another stela was erected in front of the South Pyramid. All three of the principal pyramids in Group C still support the remains of their summit shrines, possibly even with parts of their roofs and [[roof comb]]s. The construction of these remaining structures consists of the thin, flat stones associated with the Terminal Classic occupation of the site.&lt;ref name="Foiaset_b" /&gt;

[[File:Motul de San José 77.JPG|thumb|right|Summit of the north twin temple, viewed from the saddle between the two pyramids]]
The '''Twin Temples''' were both built on the same platform on the east side of the Main Plaza and have heights of {{convert|17|m|ft}} and {{convert|18|m|ft}}, three stelae (Stelae 3, 4 and 5) were erected in front of them in a north-south line. The south pyramid of the two has been somewhat damaged by looters.&lt;ref name="Foiaset_c"&gt;Foias et al 1998a, p.11. Moriarty 2004, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these pyramids probably originally supported [[roof comb]]s and were accessed by twin stairways rising from the plaza to the west.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_d" /&gt;

The '''Acropolis''' is a palace complex laid out around six small plazas, which it completely encloses, and forms the north side of the Main Plaza.&lt;ref name="Foiaset_c" /&gt; It is a massive architectural complex covering an area of more than {{convert|83000|m2|sqft}} and is likely to have been the palace of the royal family.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_d" /&gt; Two structures lying immediately to the south of the central plaza within the complex itself measure as high as {{convert|10.8|m|ft}} and {{convert|8.7|m|ft}} respectively. Investigations at the northern extreme of the Acropolis uncovered a piece of a plate dated to the Terminal Classic period.&lt;ref name="Foiaset_b" /&gt; Excavations in the northwestern portion of the Acropolis have revealed a series of [[stucco]] floors and large amounts of [[Maya ceramics|ceramic]] remains, as well as fragments of worked stone, [[obsidian]], bone and shell. Among the artefacts recovered were three polychrome vessels, two tripod vessels, a flute and a drum. Ceramic remains dated to the Late Classic have been found in all levels of the Acropolis.&lt;ref&gt;Emery &amp; Higginbotham 1998, pp.16-18.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the ceramic vessels excavated from the acropolis was in a style associated with Tikal. Investigations behind the west structure of the northwest plaza in the Acropolis recovered fill that included ceramic fragments dating as far back as the Late Preclassic and Early Classic.&lt;ref&gt;Emery &amp; Higginbotham 1998, p.19. Foias 2003, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''South Pyramid''' is the highest structure at the site, measuring {{convert|20|m|ft}} tall. As its name suggests, it forms the south side of the Main Plaza.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_d" /&gt; Excavations on the north (plaza) side of this temple uncovered Stela 6.&lt;ref&gt;Deter-Wolf &amp; Charland 1998, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Group D====
Group D is an elaborate residential complex located to the north of the twin pyramids in Group C and northeast of the Acropolis, like the other groups it consists of various structures laid out around a plaza.&lt;ref name="Foiaset_c" /&gt; The group includes two palaces, including one on the west side of the plaza that has been badly damaged by looters.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2000, p.775. Foias 2003, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; A {{convert|5|m|ft|adj=on}} pyramid is situated on the east side of the Group D plaza. A looters' trench that was cut into the pyramid revealed earlier levels of construction consisting of well made stone blocks,&lt;ref name="Foiaset_b" /&gt; archaeological investigation of the looters' tunnel revealed that the looters had probably plundered a high-ranking noble, or royal, tomb.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_d" /&gt; Items recovered from the looted tomb included polychrome ceramic fragments, 10 pieces of jade beads, 77 pieces of shell beads, 20 jade mosaic fragments, 145 shell mosaic fragments, 98 pyrite mosaic fragments, a shell necklace and a stingray spine. The human bones in the tomb had been painted red. The presence of the royal tomb suggests either that the palaces in Group D were royal residences or those of the priesthood dedicated to the rituals of the dead king.&lt;ref name="Foias_b"&gt;Foias 2003, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The occupation of Group D dates as far back as the Middle Preclassic period.&lt;ref&gt;Foias et al 1999, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; Group D was occupied as late as the Terminal Classic, when a termination ritual was apparently performed, after which the northern building of the group was abandoned. The ritual included scattering a large amount of rubbish in front of the south entrance to the building and then possibly burning the building itself. The rubbish is presumed to have come from the area of Group D itself and included some items associated with weaving and the manufacture of paper.&lt;ref name="Foias_b" /&gt;

The south structure in Group D had a patio with two circular columns, an architectural style that is characteristic of the Terminal Classic period.&lt;ref name="Foias_b" /&gt;

====Group E====
Group E is the second largest group at Motul de San José, after Group C.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_d" /&gt; It is situated to the west of Groups C and D.&lt;ref name="Foias_b" /&gt; The group includes two pyramids, measuring {{convert|7|m|ft}} and {{convert|4|m|ft}} high, both have been looted and the taller pyramid being located north of the smaller pyramid. Residential groups lie to the south and east of the pyramids, they are made up of three to four rectangular structures laid out around small central plazas, the structures are all less than {{convert|3|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Foiaset_b" /&gt;

Two palaces investigated in Group E are architecturally quite different from the palaces in Groups C and D. A notable feature is that their doors possess projecting corners. The western structure has a vaulted room with a central bench and also a cross-shaped exterior bench, the walls of the structure still stand {{convert|1|m|ft}} high. The north structure's walls stand {{convert|0.5|m|ft}} high and its western room had been divided in two by the placement of vertical stone slabs. This north structure did not possess any interior benches. It may be that the different architectural styles of Group E and the other main groups at Motul de San José result from their association with different lineages, each with its own style.&lt;ref name="Foias_b" /&gt;

Group E is distinguished by a {{convert|200|m|ft|adj=on}} long avenue, known as the North South Avenue, with residential groups on the east side. On the west side the avenue is bordered by a {{convert|1|m|ft|adj=on}} high wall. The northern end of the avenue terminates at a small temple while the south ends at Plaza B.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_d" /&gt;

===Stelae===
[[File:Maler Explorations of the Upper Usumatsintla plate 45 Motul de San José stela 2.png|thumb|right|Maler's 1908 photo of the east side of Stela 2]]
Six [[Stele|stelae]] are known from Motul de San José, all were found in Group C, with five of them being located in the Main Plaza.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_f"&gt;Moriarty 2004, pp.30-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 1''', dating to the 8th century AD, contains the first known mention anywhere of the phrase ''Itza Chul Ahau'' ("Divine Lord of the Itza").&lt;ref&gt;Caso Barrera &amp; Aliphat 2002, p.714. Moriarty 2004, pp.30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated on the west side of the Main Plaza in Group C and has the most well preserved hieroglyphic text at the site. The text describes the accession to the throne of a local lord under the supervision of [[Jasaw Chan K'awiil I]] of Tikal. Stela 1 also provides the best evidence yet found identifying Motul de San José as the Late Classic ''Ik'' polity.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_f" /&gt;

'''Stela 2''' is situated some distance to the west of the Main Plaza in Group C, in Plaza B, in front of a small temple.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_f" /&gt; This stela was photographed by [[Teoberto Maler]] in the first decade of the 20th century. The stela depicts king Yajawte' K'inich, it shows dancing figures on its east face.&lt;ref name="DeterWolf"&gt;Deter-Wolf &amp; Charland 1998, p.33. Reents-Budet et al 2007, p.1418.&lt;/ref&gt; On its west face it depicts a figure sculpted using the so-called X-ray style found on Ik-style ceramics, which depicts the face in profile wearing a mask that has been cut away to show the face underneath.&lt;ref name="VelasqeezGarcia" /&gt;

'''Stela 3''' is located on the east side of the Main Plaza in Group C, north of Stela 4.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_f" /&gt;

[[File:Motul de San José 1160.JPG|thumb|left|Stela 2 at Motul de San José as it appears now]]
'''Stela 4''' is situated on the east side of the Main Plaza in Group C, near the Twin Temples, just south of Stela 3 and north of Stela 5.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty 2004, pp.30-31. Deter-Wolf &amp; Charland 1998, p.33.&lt;/ref&gt; The stela shows king Yajawte' K'inich performing a dance, with one foot raised.&lt;ref name="DeterWolf" /&gt;

'''Stela 5''' is also located on the east side of the Main Plaza, just south of Stela 4.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_f" /&gt;

'''Stela 6''' is located on the south side of the Main Plaza in Group C, just north of the South Pyramid. It was discovered in 1988 and had been broken into many pieces, although the base of the stela was still ''in situ''. Two other large fragments were lying on the surface and more than 100 smaller fragments were collected. The stela appears to have shattered when it fell, some time after Motul de San José had been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty 2004, pp. 30–31. Deter-Wolf &amp; Charland 1998, pp. 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt; The north and south faces of the stela bore sculpted designs, the remaining butt of the stela has the left foot of a human figure worked in profile on the south side. The sculpture on the north side has been pieced together in part and appears to have shown the figure of a ruler of the city dressed in rich clothing and regalia. The figure was positioned performing a dance, with one foot half lifted off the ground. In his right hand the ruler held a [[God K]] sceptre. The prelimanry reconstruction of the sculpture indicates that the figure of the king measured between {{convert|2.5|and|3|m|ft}} high. Stela 6 is very similar to Stela 1 from [[Dos Pilas]] with both depicting the ruler in an identical position. The stela appears to have been a relatively late addition to the plaza and dates to the Late Postclassic period.&lt;ref&gt;Deter-Wolf &amp; Charland 1998, pp. 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Akte===
Akte is situated {{convert|7.1|km|mi}} northwest of Motul de San José and is known for its sculptured monuments.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty 2005, p.444.&lt;/ref&gt; The centre of Akte covers an area of {{convert|35|ha|sqmi}} and includes 32 structures on a {{convert|40|m|ft|adj=on}} high artificially landscaped hill, with a number of other structures scattered through the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty 2004, p.33. Moriarty 2005, p.444.&lt;/ref&gt; The hill supporting the site core overlooks the rivers Akte and Kantetul.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_g" /&gt; The main periods of occupation date to the Late Preclassic and Late Classic with further occupation in the Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty 2005, pp.444-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The overall area of Akte is probably larger than that of Trinidad de Nosotros, covering a {{convert|2|to|3|km2|sqmi}} area, but this includes less structures than at Trinidad, with small residential groups widely scattered on hilltops around the site core.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_g" /&gt;

The main residential complex at Akte rests upon a {{convert|3|to|5|m|ft}} platform and contains three patios, with other residential groups clustered around the east, south and west side of the platform's base. A small temple is located on the east side of the north patio.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_g" /&gt; Akte may have served as a rural administrative centre or perhaps as a royal estate of the Motul de San José elite.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_h"&gt;Moriarty 2004, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven sculpted monuments have been found at Akte, an unusual number for such a small site. If these monuments were originally erected at Akte, then this may mean that the site was actually outside of the Motul de San José polity. Archaeological investigations of the stelae carried out in 2003 were unable to determine if the monuments had been moved to Akte or not.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_h" /&gt;

'''Stela 1''' is the best preserved monument at Akte.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty 2004, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; It is badly eroded and can be dated by a damaged Long Count date inscribed on the back, which dates it to the end of the 7th century or the beginning of the 8th.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_i"&gt;Moriarty 2005, p.445.&lt;/ref&gt; The front of the stela bears the representation of a standing "divine lord" with attributes typical of the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_i" /&gt;

'''Stela 2''' is badly damaged, being broken into a number of fragments.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_i" /&gt;

'''Stela 3''' had a cache of 44 pieces of [[obsidian]] buried near its base.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_i" /&gt;

===Buena Vista===
Buena Vista lies {{convert|3|km|mi}} to the southwest of the site core and {{convert|0.5|km|mi}} from the northwest shore of Lake Petén Itzá.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty 2005, p.443. Castellanos Cabrera 2008, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; 13 structures have been mapped, situated around a small plaza, with a small temple on the east side.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_j"&gt;Moriarty 2005, p.443.&lt;/ref&gt; The site is located on a hilltop and was once much larger but has been partially covered by the modern development of Nuevo San José.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_j" /&gt; Structures 4 and 8 have been investigated, revealing that Buena Vista was probably occupied from the Middle Preclassic through to the Late Classic, with a much reduced population in the Early Postclassic.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_j" /&gt; The site was surveyed in 2000 and preliminary excavations took place in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Castellanos Cabrera 2008, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; The main pyramids of Motul de San José are visible from Buena Vista, as is a large part of the lake.&lt;ref name="CastellanosCabrera_a"&gt;Castellanos Cabrera 2008, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Buena Vista has fairly good soil and the surviving portions of the site are currently used for [[milpa]] cultivation.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_k"&gt;Moriarty 2004, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest ceramic evidence excavated at Buena Vista dates to the very end of the Early Preclassic period, indicating that the site was initially settled at the transition between the Early and Middle Preclassic periods.&lt;ref&gt;Castellanos Cabrera 2008, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; The long occupational history of Buena Vista may be linked to its proximity to [[chert]]-rich hills. Excavations have revealed evidence of chert workshops dedicated to the production of tools, together with dumps of waste flakes.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_k" /&gt;

Buena Vista features an early architectural style that differs from that at Motul de San José, consisting of platforms built from unworked stone, with wide front stairways and probably without superstructures. They were built in the Middle to Late Preclassic periods and then reused in the Late Classic. The differences in style between Buena Vista and Motul probably results from differing epochs of construction.&lt;ref name="Foias_b" /&gt;

'''Group A''' is arranged around the main plaza.&lt;ref name="CastellanosCabrera"&gt;Castellanos Cabrera 2008, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Group B''' is located a little to the southeast,&lt;ref name="CastellanosCabrera" /&gt; and contains structures 11 to 14.&lt;ref name="CastellanosCabrera_b"&gt;Castellanos Cabrera 2008, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure 1''' is the East Pyramid, it is located on the hillside a short distance from the rest of the mounds.&lt;ref name="CastellanosCabrera_a" /&gt; It was a {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} high Late Classic funerary structure containing a looted tomb.&lt;ref name="CastellanosCabrera_b" /&gt; From the summit of this temple both Lake Petén Itzá and the Twin Temples of Group C at Motul de San José are visible.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_k" /&gt;

'''Structure 4''' is the North Structure.&lt;ref name="CastellanosCabrera_b" /&gt; It dates to the Late Classic but overlies construction dating to the Middle Preclassic.&lt;ref name="CastellanosCabrera_b" /&gt; A stairway ascended the front of the building, under which were found the remains of Late Classic polychrome ceramics, perhaps belonging to a pre-construction ritual offering.&lt;ref name="CastellanosCabrera_b" /&gt; The stucco floors on top of the mound supported asymmetric walls that perhaps date to the Postclassic Period, being associated with a mix of Late Classic and Postclassic pottery.&lt;ref name="CastellanosCabrera_b" /&gt;

'''Structures 7, 8''' and '''9''' were long, low rectangular platforms.&lt;ref name="CastellanosCabrera_b" /&gt; They measure {{convert|15|m|ft}} long by {{convert|3.5|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|0.6|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="CastellanosCabrera_b" /&gt; They had perishable roofs and date to the Late Classic, although Structures 7 and 8 may overlie Middle Preclassic remains.&lt;ref name="CastellanosCabrera_b" /&gt;

===Chachaklum===
Chachaklum (also spelt Chächäklu'um) is situated {{convert|5|km|mi}} east of the site core and may also have formed a part of the Motul de San José polity.&lt;ref&gt;Emery 2003, pp.34-35.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a large site covering over {{convert|2|km2|sqmi}}, an area that includes over 141 structures. Chachaklum includes a small ceremonial centre where a possible [[E-Group]] has been identified. The site is located in an area of [[savanna]] with poor soils considered unsuitable for the growing of [[maize]], somewhat at odds with the settlement density of the site. The contrast between the settlement density and poor soils has highlighted the need for further research into [[Agriculture in Mesoamerica|Maya agriculture]] in a savanna environment.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_h" /&gt; Chachaklum was a relatively large site of secondary rank within the Motul de San José polity.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_q"&gt;Moriarty &amp; Castellanos 2007, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chachaklum's principal phase of occupation appears to date to the Terminal Classic period, during the 10th and 11th centuries AD. However, the site possesses massive basal platforms and these, together with the presence of the E-Group, suggests a longer occupational period than was immediately evident from the first excavations of the site. Further investigations have revealed a long occupational history beginning in the Late Preclassic period and continuing right through to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_l" /&gt;

===Chak Maman Tok' (La Estrella)===
Chak Maman Tok' is a very small site located {{convert|3.6|km|mi}} southwest of Motul de San José and about {{convert|0.5|km|mi}} from Buena Vista. The site includes a small number of mounds spread along the hillside overlooking Lake Petén Itzá. The site was investigated by archaeologists in 2005 and 2006. Although the site is very small, it seems to have been an important centre for the production of high-quality chert tools, and one of the major manufacturers of chert tools in the Petén lowlands with considerable economic importance within the Motul de San José polity.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_l" /&gt;

The site has been severely damaged by modern construction with the chert deposits being reused as construction material.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_l" /&gt;

===Chakokot===
Chakokot is located {{convert|2|km|mi}} to the east of the Main Plaza.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_m"&gt;Moriarty 2005, p.441.&lt;/ref&gt; It occupies an area of {{convert|16|ha|sqmi}} and consists of 59 structures widely dispersed around a small plaza upon the flat summit of a {{convert|40|m|ft|adj=on}} high hill.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty 2004, p.36. Moriarty 2005, p.441.&lt;/ref&gt; Principal occupation dates from the Late Preclassic and Late Classic periods.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_m" /&gt; The soils at Chakokot are considered good for agriculture and maize was grown within the site itself. The area between Chakokot and Motul de San José is occupied by a ''bajo'', or low-lying seasonal swamp.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_n"&gt;Moriarty 2004, pp.36-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Plaza''' at Chakokot is small and covers an area of about {{convert|1200|m2|sqft}}. On the north and east sides it is bordered by residential groups, a {{convert|3|m|ft|adj=on}} square platform is to the south and on the west by two low parallel structures measuring just {{convert|0.50|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_n" /&gt;

The largest structure at Chakokot is a {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}} tall temple to the east of a large residential area bordering the Plaza on the east side.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty 2004, p.37. Moriarty 2005, p.441.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the residential areas at Chakokot possess one or more bottle-shaped underground storage chambers, known as ''[[chultun]]ob'', with 14 having been found as of 2001. Because of the thick vegetation at the site, investigators consider that there are probably more to be found. These ''chultunob'' were closed with disc-shaped stone lids, many of which were found either still in place or close to the aperture of the ''chultun'' to which it belonged. The stone lids were without perforations so it is supposed that the chambers were used to store dry goods rather than water.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_h" /&gt;

===Kantetul===
Kantetul is located {{convert|2|km|mi}} north of the site core.&lt;ref name="Emery_a" /&gt;

===Ox Ool===
Ox Ool is located in the hill country a few kilometers south of Motul de San José, and has fertile soil for agriculture.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_k" /&gt;

===Tikalito===
Tikalito is located in the hills a few kilometers north-northwest of Motul de San José, and possesses rich soils for agriculture.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_k" /&gt;

===La Trinidad de Nosotros===
La Trinidad is known as ''Sik'u' '' in the [[Itza language]]. It is located {{convert|2.6|km|mi}} southeast of Motul de San José on the northern shore of Lake Petén Itzá.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_i" /&gt; The site is located at the closest point to Motul on the lake shore and it may have served as a Maya port.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty 2005, p.445. Spensley 2005, p.434.&lt;/ref&gt; The site has more than 115 structures located in an area of {{convert|35|ha|sqmi}}, and the site may actually cover {{convert|55|ha|sqmi}} and contain about 150 structures.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_p"&gt;Moriarty 2005, p.448.&lt;/ref&gt; The site had a long occupational history stretching right through from the Middle Preclassic to the Early Postclassic, with two phases of greater activity in the Early Classic around AD 350 and in the Late Classic from AD 650&amp;ndash;830.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_o"&gt;Moriarty 2005, p.449.&lt;/ref&gt; The Terminal Classic occupation was largely limited to the lake shore but was fairly dense.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_o" /&gt; The monumental architecture, port and the ballcourt all identify La Trinidad de Nosotros as an important secondary centre within the Motul de San José polity.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_o" /&gt; Additionally, the site was situated close to a source of chert and probably manufactured chert tools.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2003, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;

La Trinidad de Nosotros has been tentatively identified as Xililchi, a settlement visited by [[conquistador]] [[Martín de Ursúa]] after [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish Conquest]] of the Itza capital [[Tayasal|Noj Petén]] in 1697, but no Late Postclassic remains have yet been securely identified.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_c" /&gt;

The site is divided into two areas.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_p" /&gt; The site core is located on a hill {{convert|40|m|ft}} above the lake and with a good view across it.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_p" /&gt; The second area is spread along the lake shore and the hillside leading to the site core.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_p" /&gt; The site core  has at least 80 structures arranged around five plazas.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_p" /&gt; The majority of the structures are residential in nature but La Trinidad has an unusual amount of ceremonial architecture for such a small site.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_p" /&gt; La Trinidad seems to have been an important port for the import and export of goods to and from Motul de San José.&lt;ref name="Emery_b" /&gt;

Group C is the main residential complex of the site, it has a small shrine at the eastern end.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_g" /&gt; La Trinidad de Nosotros has five main plazas within its site core, labelled I through to V. All of them were resurfaced multiple times between the Late Preclassic and Late Classic. The combined surface areas of the five plazas cover over {{convert|20000|m2|sqft}}, with Plaza V making up about half of this, making it slightly smaller than the main plaza at Motul de San José itself.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty 2004, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure A-1''' is the main temple, it is a {{convert|12|m|ft|adj=on}} high radial pyramid.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_p" /&gt;

'''Structure C-1''' is an elite residence.&lt;ref name="Spensley"&gt;Spensley 2005, p.434.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure E-1''' may originally have been a circular building.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_p" /&gt;

'''Structure G-1''' is a sub-elite residence.&lt;ref name="Spensley" /&gt;
The '''[[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]]''' is located in Group F.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_p" /&gt; It is in the form of a T-shape, with {{convert|25|m|ft|adj=on}} long sides, a closed northern end zone and a small temple adjoining the eastern side.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty 2004, p.33. Moriarty 2005, p.448.&lt;/ref&gt; The last phase of construction dates to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_p" /&gt; The ballcourt is similar in design to the ballcourt on the Main Plaza of Dos Pilas in the Petexbatún region.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_g" /&gt; No ballcourt has been identified at the Motul de San José site itself, making the presence of one here of especial interest.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_g" /&gt; Rich deposits were found associated with the ballcourt, including 21,000 potsherds, 239 pieces of obsidian, 155 fragments of ceramic figurines and 84 stone tools.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty &amp; Castellanos 2007, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Group O''' is a small residential group to the west of Plaza V.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_q" /&gt;

Various structures have been identified in the area of the port, including retaining walls, a possible breakwater and a quay.&lt;ref name="Moriarty_p" /&gt; The port appears to have been partially enclosed by an artificial peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty 2005, pp.448-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ottmar Ette''' (born 14 December 1956 in [[Zell am Harmersbach]], Black Forest, Germany) is Professor of [[Romance languages]] and [[Comparative literature]] at [[Universität Potsdam|the University of Potsdam]].

== Biographical notes ==
In 1990, Ottmar Ette completed his dissertation at [[Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg|Freiburg University]] on the Spanish-American modernist and Cuban national icon [[José Martí]]. In 1995, his [[habilitation]] on French post-modern theorist [[Roland Barthes]] was accepted at [[Katholische Universität Eichstätt-Ingolstadt|Eichstätt University]]. In 2001, Ette received the "Hugo Friedrich und Erich Köhler"-award for his work on Roland Barthes from Freiburg University. Twice, he has been granted fellowships in advanced-study institutions. He has lectured and taught in a number of Latin-American and European countries, as well as in the USA. He has been a full professor Romance literature and comparative literature in [[Potsdam]] since 1995. To Ottmar Ette, Romance philology is a wide-ranging and inclusive academic field of inquiry which connects a number of disciplines and languages as it tells us about literary knowledge of human life.

Since 2013, Ottmar Ette is member of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities. In 2014, he was elected as honorary member of the Modern Language Association of America.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.commons.mla.org/2014/06/04/results-of-2014-ratification-vote/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Ottmar Ette received the Mexican Research Award "Escuela Nacional de Altos Estudios" from the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-potsdam.de/romanistik/ette/ette/aktuelles.html/&lt;/ref&gt;

Ottmar Ette is Chevalier in the [[Ordre des Palmes Académiques]] (France) since 2012. He has been a regular member of the [[Academia Europaea]] since 2010. Also in 2010, he was a fellow at the [[Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies]]. This was after having already received a fellowship at the [[Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin]] Institute for Advanced Study in 2004/2005. He has been involved in establishing a number of state-funded [[Graduate school|"Graduiertenkolleg"-graduate schools]] at German universities. He is a co-founder of a research-network on Latin-America in the wider Berlin area, ForLaBB (Forschungsverbund Lateinamerika Berlin-Brandenburg).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lateinamerika-forschung-berlin-brandenburg.de/&lt;/ref&gt;

He is founder and co-editor of the electronic journal HiN - [[Alexander von Humboldt]] im Netz ({{ISSN|1617-5239}}) and an online platform dedicated to von Humboldt [http://www.avhumboldt.de/ avhumboldt.de - Humboldt Informationen online]. Ette is also co-editor of the journal Iberoamericana (Madrid - Frankfurt am Main). Since 2009, he has also been co-editor of the electronic journal [https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094605/http://collaborations.denison.edu/istmo/ Istmo (Revista virtual de estudios literarios y culturales centroamericanos, {{ISSN|1535-2315}})].

Ottmar Ette directs the Research Project on "Alexander von Humboldt's American Travel Diaries: Genealogy, Chronology, and Epistemology" (2014-2017) and, since 2015, an eighteen-year project on "Travelling Humboldt - Science on the Move" of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities (http://www.bbaw.de/en/research/avh-r).

== Interests and Influence ==
Ottmar Ette's programmatic essay "Literaturwissenschaft als Lebenswissenschaft - Eine Programmschrift im Jahr der Geisteswissenschaften"&lt;ref&gt;Lendemains. Études comparées sur la France. Zeitschrift für vergleichende Frankreichforschung, 125. Gunter Narr, Tübingen 2007 {{ISSN|0170-3803}} p.7 - 32&lt;/ref&gt; sparked wide-ranging reactions and discussion in Germany. Among many other publications, the theme reappeared in the national weekly paper Die Zeit.&lt;ref&gt;Lendemains, op. cit., nos. 126/127, 128 and 129 and [http://www.zeit.de/2010/25/L-S-Lebenswissenschaft] in [[Die Zeit]]&lt;/ref&gt; The basic thrust of Ette's argument is to reconceptualize literary studies in terms of a science of life or "life science": "Lebenswissenschaft". Literature, Ette claims, is an essential repository of human knowledge on life, especially with respect to ethically relevant experiences such as living-together or "conviviality", migration and belonging, or survival in times of existential danger. The term "Lebenswissenschaft" is coined to oppose and call into question the increasing dominance of the biological or medical "life sciences", that have begun to monopolize and reduce concept and semantics of human life. Ette recently presented his argument in English in the [[Modern Language Association]]'s PMLA.&lt;ref&gt;PMLA. Publications of the Modern Language Association of America (New York) CXXV, 4 (october 2010), pp. 977-993.[http://www.mlajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1632/pmla.2010.125.4.977]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ottmar Ette has also received much attention for his work on and editions of the writings of [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. He is considered a leading specialist on Humboldt's original scientific approach and extremely prolific work. Whereas Alexander von Humboldt has always been a well-known figure in the Americas, German reception had been heavily focused on the philological work of his older brother, [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. Ette's new editions of Alexander's colourful reports from his voyages have led to a more evenly balanced reception of the work of the two polymaths Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt. As early as 1987, Ette's work on Alexander von Humboldt earned him the "Heinz-Maier-Leibnitz" Award from the German Ministry of Culture and the German Research Association [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|DFG]]. In the English-speaking world, Ottmar Ette and Vera M. Kutzinski (Vanderbildt University) recently published two critical editions of Humboldt's works: in 2011, the "Political Essay on the Island of Cuba; in 2012, the "Views of the Cordilleras and Monuments of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas", both titles published with the [[University of Chicago Press]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/series/HUMBENG.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philippe de Montebello''' (born May 16, 1936 in [[Paris]]) is a museum director.  He served from 1977 to 2008 as the director of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]].  On his retirement, he was both the longest-serving director in the institution's history, and the third longest-serving director of any major art museum in the world (first is [[Irina Antonova]], who was the Director of the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow for 52 years, from 1961 to 2013, making her the oldest and the longest serving director of a major art museum in the world. Second is Knud W. Jensen, who served as the director of Denmark's [[Louisiana_Museum_of_Modern_Art#Directors|Louisiana Museum of Modern Art]] north of Copenhagen for 35 years, from 1958 to 1993).  From January 2009, Montebello took up a post as the first [[Fiske Kimball]] Professor in the History and Culture of Museums at [[New York University]]'s [[Institute of Fine Arts]].

Born to a French [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]ic family, de Montebello immigrated to the [[United States of America]] in the 1950s, and became a naturalized citizen of the US in 1955.  He was educated in New York City at the [[Lycée Français de New York|Lycée Français]] de New York, graduated from [[Harvard University]] with a degree in art history, and earned an MA from [[New York University]], after which he embarked on a career in [[Fine Arts]].  He became the Director of the Metropolitan Museum in 1977 and has become widely known as the public face of the museum.

He announced his retirement on 8 January 2008, stating that he intended to step down by the end of 2008 after more than 31 years at his post.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/arts/design/09muse.html Patrician Director of Metropolitan Museum to Retire] ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 9, 2007 (accessed January 9, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born Guy Philippe Henri Lannes de Montebello in Paris in 1936 to a family descended from the [[Napoleon]]ic aristocracy, de Montebello was the second of four sons. His father, Baron André Roger Lannes de Montebello ([[Biarritz]], July 6, 1908 - [[New York City]], December 2, 1986), was a [[portrait painter]], [[art critic]], and a member of the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]]. His mother, Germaine Wiener de Croisset (born in Paris, October 26, 1913 and married in Paris, November 30, 1933), was a descendant of the [[Marquis de Sade]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}, a daughter of the [[playwright]] [[Francis de Croisset]], and a half-sister of the arts patron [[Marie-Laure de Noailles]]. One of de Montebello's great-great-great-grandfathers was [[Jean Lannes]], Duke of Montebello and [[Marshal of France]].

Both parents were involved in a project to develop a form of three-dimensional [[photography]], and it was in search of [[venture capital]] for this enterprise that the family came to New York in 1951. Whereas his brothers would all eventually return to France to take up jobs in [[banking]], Philippe stayed in the United States and became an [[American citizen]] in 1955.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

De Montebello was educated at the [[Lycée Français de New York|Lycée Français]] in New York, where he received his ''[[baccalauréat]]'' in 1954. He then went on to study [[art history]] at [[Harvard University]], graduating [[magna cum laude]], before continuing his studies at [[New York University]]'s [[Institute of Fine Arts]] under [[Charles Sterling]], an expert in [[French Renaissance]] art.

===Early career===
In 1963, he began work for the Met as a curatorial assistant in the Department of European Paintings, rising to full curator.  He then spent four-and-a-half-years (1969–1974) as Director of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], returning to the Met as vice director for curatorial and educational affairs.  He became director in 1977.

===Family===
On June 24, 1961 in New York, he married Edith Myles (born in New York, October 20, 1939), who is the financial-aid director of the [[Trinity School (New York)|Trinity School]] in New York City. They have three children: Count Marc André Marie (born in New York, October 11, 1964), married civilly at [[Choiseul, Haute-Marne|Choiseul]] and religiously at [[Marnes La Coquette]], November 28, 1986 and divorced Laure Marie Dauphine de Sabran-Pontèves (born at [[Neuilly]], February 26, 1966), by whom he had a son Alexandre (born in New York, May 9, 1987); Laure (born in [[New York City]], May 5, 1968) married to Robert Bernstein, M.D., with two children, Claire and Maximilian (Max); and Charles (born in [[Houston, Texas]], January 16, 1971), married to Raasa Leela Shields (born in Richmond, Virginia) with two children, [[Kivlighan Finch]] and Everest Leo Myles.

==Curator of the Metropolitan Museum==
Under his directorship the Metropolitan Museum has nearly doubled in size to two million square feet.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Notable changes have included the opening of the Carroll and Milton Petrie European Sculpture Court in 1990, new galleries for Greek &amp; Roman art, the recently opened {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Ruth and Harold D. Uris Center for Education, the remodeled and reinstalled galleries for Oceanic and Native North American art, and expanded galleries for Chinese, Cypriot, Ancient Near Eastern, and Korean art. In 2007, the Metropolitan reopened its expanded galleries for 19th- and early 20th-century European paintings and decorative arts, formerly [[Modernism|Modernist]], in a historicizing [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style, and a new high-ceilinged gallery to show off [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]]'s monumental paintings to their best advantage. Criticism of de Montebello has focused on his alleged conservatism regarding modern and contemporary art: in a 1999 op-ed piece in the ''[[New York Times]]'' he lauded the city's mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] for rubbishing [[Chris Ofili]]'s infamous painting ''[[Holy Virgin Mary]]'', which used elephant dung as one of its materials. In the early years of his tenure, the Department of Modern Art was said to lag behind the museum's other departments in its spending power.  But in recent years, the Museum has purchased iconic works by [[Jasper Johns]], [[Damien Hirst]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and mounted exhibitions by contemporary artists like Johns, Rauschenberg, [[Tara Donovan]], [[Sean Scully]], and [[Kara Walker]].

Mr. de Montebello's other major building programs have included the expansion and renovation of period rooms and galleries for the decorative arts, the opening of new permanent exhibition galleries for drawings, prints, and photographs (supplemented in 2007 with the new Joyce and Robert Menschel Hall for Modern Photography), the conservation and installation of the Gubbio Studiolo, the opening of the Antonio Ratti Textile Conservation Center, the opening of the new Mary and [[Michael Jaharis]] Gallery for Byzantine art, and the installation of Coptic art in a crypt-like gallery carved out of former storage space beneath the museum's Great Hall staircase.  

Under de Montebello's directorship, the Met acquired many major private collections, notably the Jack and Belle Linsky Collection of European Paintings, sculpture, and decorative arts; the Heinz Berggruen collection of works by Paul Klee; the gift of 10 paintings by Clyfford Still by the artist's widow; the Annenberg Collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings; the Florene Schoenborn collection of 20th-century works; the Jacques and Natasha Gelman Collection of modern paintings; the Gilman Paper Company Collection of 19th-century photographs; the Muriel Kallis Steinberg Newman Collection of Abstract Expressionist and other modern works; and most recently, the Diane Arbus archive.

De Montebello also worked to acquire a number of individual masterpieces over the years, including works by [[Vermeer]], [[Rubens]], [[Guercino]], and [[Nikolaus Gerhaert von Leyden]].  Among the most celebrated of these acquisitions have been the 11th-century gilt-bronze Cambodian deified king known as the "Golden Boy" in 1988; [[Vincent Van Gogh]]'s "Wheat Field with Cypresses" in 1993, Jasper Johns'  ''[[White Flag (Johns painting)|White Flag]]'' in 1998, and in 2004 the Madonna and Child by the Renaissance master [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]].

Throughout this period, the Met under de Montebello's leadership mounted some 30 special exhibitions annually, involving not only all the museum's 17 curatorial departments, but also presenting works of art on loan from public and private collections around the world (current shows listed on the museum's website, metmuseum.org).  Many of the shows were accompanied by the publication of major catalogues.  Under de Montebello, the Met has become the leading art book publisher in the U.S., issuing some 25-30 illustrated volumes each year, most carrying an introduction by the director.

Long the "voice of the Met," de Montebello also narrates the Met's audio guides for both exhibitions and the permanent collection. He lectures on museological matters throughout the world, and has also given public readings of [[French poetry]] by [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and others at the museum.

===Retirement===
On January 8, 2008, he announced his intention to retire by the end of 2008 ({{cite journal | last = Vogel | first = Carol | title = Director (and Voice) of Met Museum to Retire | journal = New York Times | date = 2008-01-09}}).   He was succeeded by [[Thomas Campbell (curator)|Thomas Campbell]] in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;"Metropolitan Museum Takes Bold Step; Taps young insider as its new director", Kate Taylor, ''New York Sun'', September 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association of Art Museum Curators==
De Montebello assisted in the formation of the [[Association of Art Museum Curators]] in 2001, and later helped forge its policy on spoliated World War II-era art, advocating transparent research into the ownership history of museum collections, and testifying on Capitol Hill.  In August 2006 he successfully negotiated the precedent-setting agreement with the Italian government that ended years of disputes regarding the legal ownership of several works in its Greek and Roman collections.  Under the terms of the historic pact, Italy provided long-term loans to the Met in exchange for the return of these works.

==Teaching==
De Montebello is the first professor to teach the history and culture of museums at [[New York University]]'s Institute of Fine Arts.  In addition to being a full-time professor at the IFA, where he discusses topics such as the history of collecting and the progression and modernization of museums, de Montebello also advises NYU on its planned overseas campus and curriculum in Abu Dhabi, scheduled to begin enrolling students in 2010.  He began teaching at NYU in January 2009 as well as consulting and lecturing at several museums on the modernization of their collections.&lt;ref name="mnt520"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/arts/design/20muse.html?_r=1&amp;ref=arts&amp;oref=slogin|title=Met Director Will Become Professor at N.Y.U. Institute|accessdate=2008-05-20|date=2008-05-20|author=Carol Vogel|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, de Montebello served as the [[Humanitas Programme|Humanitas Visiting Professor]] in the History of Art at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicdialogue.org/events/items/humanitas-historyofart-montebello |title=Event : Institute for Strategic Dialogue |publisher=Strategicdialogue.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202222619/http://www.strategicdialogue.org/events/items/humanitas-historyofart-montebello |archivedate=2014-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Montebello also serves as co-host of [[NYC-ARTS]], a weekly program highlighting current New York City exhibitions, cultural institutions and profiling relevant contributors to the arts on [[Thirteen/WNET]].

In April, 2015 the [[Hispanic Society of America]] announced the appointment of Philippe de Montebello to chair the Society's Board of Overseers and spearhead a major effort to roughly double the museum's size by renovating the now-vacant, adjacent, Beaux Arts, former building of the [[Museum of the American Indian]].&lt;ref name=Catton&gt;{{cite news|last1=Catton|first1=Pia|title=New Chairman Hopes to Boost Profile of Often-Overlooked Museum|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-head-hopes-to-boost-profile-of-often-overlooked-museum-1429577278|accessdate=23 April 2015|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
Montebello was made a [[Légion d'honneur|Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur]] in 1991 (he was promoted to the rank of Officier in 2007). His adopted home country followed suit by awarding him the [[National Medal of Arts]] in 2002, the [[National Humanities Medal]] in 2010, and the Mayor's Arts Award in 2007. De Montebello was also awarded the Order of Isabel la Catolica, Encomienda de Numero; the Spanish Institute Gold Medal Award; Knight Commander, Pontifical Order of St. Gregory the Great; the 2002 Blerancourt Prize; the 2004 Amigos del Museo del Prado Prize; and in 2007 the [[Order of the Rising Sun]], Gold &amp; Silver Star, from the Government of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Japan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs: [http://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/gaiko/protocol/pdfs/h19_au.pdf  "2007 Fall Conferment of Decorations on Foreign Nationals," p. 2.]  Mofa.go.jp&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Montebello received the [http://www.newcriterion.com/gala/ Edmund Burke Award for Culture and Society], awarded by monthly cultural review [http://www.newcriterion.com/ The New Criterion]. He has received honorary degrees from [[New York University]], Dartmouth College, Lafayette College, Bard College, Iona College, the Savannah College of Art and Design, and his alma mater, Harvard. De Montebello is a recipient of The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3036">The best-known '''pleorama''' was a 19th-century moving [[Panoramic painting|panorama]] entertainment where the viewers sat in a rocking boat while panoramic views on painted canvas rolled past. The word has sometimes been used for other entertainments or innovations.

Architect [[Carl Ferdinand Langhans]] introduced a pleorama in [[Breslau]] in 1831 with scenes of the [[Bay of Naples]] on both sides of 24 "voyagers" sitting in a wooden boat floating in a pool of water. The illusion was enhanced by light and sound effects: the boatman singing, [[Vesuvius]] erupting. Writer/artist [[August Kopisch]] was involved in designing the hour-long show.

Carl Wilhelm Gropius, who had a [[diorama]] exhibit in [[Berlin]], took over management of this pleorama in 1832, and there was also a pleorama of a journey along the river [[Rhine]]. 

The Swiss writer Bernard Comment, among others, has pointed out the similarities between Langhans' pleorama and the ambitious [[mareorama]] at the 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Exhibition]].

A similar idea was used for a [[London]] ''padorama'' in 1834. Spectators were seated in [[railway]] carriages to watch a moving panorama of scenes visible from the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]].

In 1850s [[Finland]] the name ''pleorama'' was given to shows which presented historic scenes and panoramic views using glass, but posters for these do not mention anything resembling Langhans' boat concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibbild.abo.fi/nojen/ Posters in Swedish for pleoramas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''pleorama'' was coined from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] elements. Like other 19th century novelties ending in ''-orama'' - [[diorama]] and [[cyclorama]], for instance - the second half of the word has the sense of 'something seen'. The ''pleo-'' part here is understood to come from a Greek word meaning 'float' which applies to Langhans' boat in water idea. ''Pleorama'' is also the 21st century name of an innovative "floating house".

'''Prenatal perception''' is the study of the extent of [[somatosensory]] and other types of [[perception]] during [[pregnancy]]. In practical terms, this means the study of [[fetus]]es; none of the accepted indicators of perception are present in [[embryo]]s. {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Studies in the field inform the [[abortion debate]], along with certain related pieces of legislation in countries affected by that debate.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}{{examples needed|date=December 2017}}

==Prenatal hearing==
Numerous studies have found evidence indicating a fetus's ability to respond to auditory stimuli. Research indicates that fetuses of 33–41 weeks gestational age can not only hear, but also distinguish their mothers' voices from others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2008.10.002 |pmid=19058856 |title=Fetal sensitivity to properties of maternal speech and language |journal=Infant Behavior and Development |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=59–71 |year=2009 |last1=Kisilevsky |first1=B.S. |last2=Hains |first2=S.M.J. |last3=Brown |first3=C.A. |last4=Lee |first4=C.T. |last5=Cowperthwaite |first5=B. |last6=Stutzman |first6=S.S. |last7=Swansburg |first7=M.L. |last8=Lee |first8=K. |last9=Xie |first9=X. |last10=Huang |first10=H. |last11=Ye |first11=H.-H. |last12=Zhang |first12=K. |last13=Wang |first13=Z. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/dev.20229 |pmid=17577240 |title=Estimated cardiac vagal tone predicts fetal responses to mother's and stranger's voices |journal=Developmental Psychobiology |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=543–7 |year=2007 |last1=Smith |first1=Laura S. |last2=Dmochowski |first2=Pawel A. |last3=Muir |first3=Darwin W. |last4=Kisilevsky |first4=Barbara S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; See also a UK study on child's "Hearing and listening in the womb":&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maternal-and-early-years.org.uk/hearing-and-listening-in-the-womb{{full citation needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and UK material on "How babies develop hearing":&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amplifon.co.uk/resources/how-babies-develop-hearing/{{full citation needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prenatal pain==
[[File:Pregnancy timeline.png|thumb|400px|right|Pregnancy timeline]]
The hypothesis that human fetuses are capable of perceiving [[pain]] in the first trimester is not supported by science; the scientific consensus is that a fetus "is not capable of feeling pain until the third trimester",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livescience.com/54774-fetal-pain-anesthesia.html 2016{{full citation needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7546.909 |pmid=16613970 |pmc=1440624 |title=Can fetuses feel pain? |journal=BMJ |volume=332 |issue=7546 |pages=909–12 |year=2006 |last1=Derbyshire |first1=S. W G }}&lt;/ref&gt; which "begins at about 27 weeks of pregnancy".

In March 2010, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists submitted a report,&lt;ref&gt;''Fetal Awareness&amp;nbsp;– Review of Research and Recommendations for Practice'': {{cite web |url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/fetal-awareness-review-research-and-recommendations-practice |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014111725/http://www.rcog.org.uk/fetal-awareness-review-research-and-recommendations-practice |archivedate=2010-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; concluding that "Current research shows that the sensory structures are not developed or specialized enough to respond to pain in a fetus of less than 24 weeks", pg. 22. &lt;blockquote&gt;The neural regions and pathways that are responsible for pain experience remain under debate but it is generally accepted that pain from physical trauma requires an intact pathway from the periphery, through the spinal cord, into the thalamus and on to regions of the cerebral cortex including the primary sensory cortex (S1), the insular cortex and the anterior cingulated cortex.3,4 Fetal pain is not possible before these necessary neural pathways and structures (figure 1) have developed. -pg. 3&lt;/blockquote&gt; The report specifically identified the [[anterior cingulate]] as the area of the [[cerebral cortex]] responsible for pain processing. The anterior cingulate is part of the cerebral cortex, which begins to develop in the fetus at week 26.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Electroencephalography indicates that the capacity for functional pain perception in premature infants does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks; a 2005 meta-analysis states that withdrawal reflexes and changes in heart rates and hormone levels in response to invasive procedures are reflexes that do not indicate fetal pain.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

Several lines of evidence suggest that a fetus does not awaken during its time in the womb. Much of the literature on fetal pain simply extrapolates from findings and research on premature babies. The presence of such chemicals as [[adenosine]], [[pregnanolone]], and [[prostaglandin]]-D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in both human and animal fetuses, indicate that the fetus is both [[sedation|sedated]] and [[anesthesia|anesthetized]] when in the womb. These chemicals are oxidized with the newborn's first few breaths and washed out of the tissues, allowing consciousness to occur. If the fetus is asleep throughout gestation then the possibility of fetal pain is greatly minimized.&lt;ref name="Diesch"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brainresrev.2005.01.006 |pmid=16269314 |title=The importance of 'awareness' for understanding fetal pain |journal=Brain Research Reviews |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=455–71 |year=2005 |last1=Mellor |first1=David J. |last2=Diesch |first2=Tamara J. |last3=Gunn |first3=Alistair J. |last4=Bennet |first4=Laura }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Paul|first=AM|title=The First Ache|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/magazine/10Fetal-t.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies show that the neuromediators supposed to anesthetise the fetus in the womb can give just a slight sedation, as their levels in some cases overlap those in adults' blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/14767058.2011.632040 |title=Is fetal pain a real evidence? |journal=[[The Journal of Maternal-Fetal &amp; Neonatal Medicine]] |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=1203 |year=2012 |last1=Bellieni |first1=Carlo Valerio |last2=Buonocore |first2=Giuseppe }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fetal anesthesia===
Direct fetal [[analgesia]] is used in only a minority of prenatal surgeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/14767058.2012.718392 |title=Use of fetal analgesia during prenatal surgery |journal=The Journal of Maternal-Fetal &amp; Neonatal Medicine |volume=26 |pages=90 |year=2012 |last1=Bellieni |first1=Carlo V. |last2=Tei |first2=M. |last3=Stazzoni |first3=G. |last4=Bertrando |first4=S. |last5=Cornacchione |first5=S. |last6=Buonocore |first6=G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some caution that unnecessary use of fetal anesthetic may pose potential health risks to the mother. "In the context of abortion, fetal analgesia would be used solely for beneficence toward the fetus, assuming fetal pain exists. This interest must be considered in concert with maternal safety and fetal effectiveness of any proposed anesthetic or analgesic technique. For instance, general anesthesia increases abortion morbidity and mortality for women and substantially increases the cost of abortion. Although placental transfer of many opioids and sedative-hypnotics has been determined, the maternal dose required for fetal analgesia is unknown, as is the safety for women at such doses.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

Fetal pain legislation may make abortions harder to obtain, because abortion clinics lack the equipment and expertise to supply fetal anesthesia. Currently, anesthesia is administered directly to fetuses only while they are undergoing surgery.&lt;ref name="paul"&gt;{{cite news |last=Paul |first=Annie Murphy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/magazine/10Fetal-t.html |title=The First Ache |work=New York Times |date=February 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctors for a Woman’s Choice on Abortion pointed out that the majority of surgical abortions in Britain are already performed under general anesthesia, which also affects the fetus. In a letter to the ''British Medical Journal'' in April 1997, they deemed the discussion "unhelpful to women and to the scientific debate"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.314.7088.1201 |title=Do fetuses feel pain? |journal=BMJ |volume=314 |issue=7088 |pages=1201 |year=1997 |last1=Savage |first1=W. |last2=Wall |first2=P. D |last3=Derbyshire |first3=S. W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite a report in the ''British Medical Journal'' that "the theoretical possibility that the fetus may feel pain (albeit much earlier than most embryologists and physiologists consider likely) with the procedure of legal abortion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.314.7076.302a |title=Do fetuses feel pain? |journal=BMJ |volume=314 |issue=7076 |pages=302 |year=1997 |last1=McCullagh |first1=P. |last2=Saunders |first2=P J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet if mothers' general anesthesia were enough to anesthetise the fetus, all fetuses would be born sleepy after a cesarean section performed in general anesthesia, which is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/ACO.0000000000000185 |title=General anesthesia for caesarean section |journal=Curr Opin Anesthesiol |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=240 |year=2015 |last1=Devroe |first1=S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States legislation==

===Federal legislation===
In 2013 during the [[113th Congress]], [[Trent Franks|Representative Trent Franks]] introduced a bill called the "[[Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act]]" (H.R. 1797). It passed in the House on June 18, 2013 and was received in the U.S. Senate, read twice, and referred to the Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?d113:h.r.1797: Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act of 2013]'' H.R.1797, 113th Cong., 1st Sess. (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 during the [[108th Congress]], [[Sam Brownback|Senator Sam Brownback]] introduced a bill called the "[[Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act]]" for the stated purpose of "ensur[ing] that women seeking an abortion are fully informed regarding the pain experienced by their unborn child.", which was read twice and referred to committee.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:S.2466: Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act of 2005],'' S.2466, 108t Cong., 2nd Sess.

Retrieved 2007-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

===State legislation===
Subsequently, 25 states have examined similar legislation related to fetal pain and/or fetal anesthesia,&lt;ref name="paul"/&gt; and in 2010 [[Nebraska]] banned abortions after 20 weeks on the basis of fetal pain.&lt;ref&gt;Kliff, Sarah ''[http://www.newsweek.com/blogs/the-gaggle/2010/04/13/newly-passed-fetal-pain-bill-in-nebraska-is-a-big-deal.html Newly Passed 'Fetal Pain' Bill in Nebraska Is a Big Deal]'' The Daily Beast Apr 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Eight states – Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Alaska, South Dakota, and Texas – have passed laws which introduced information on fetal pain in their state-issued abortion-counseling literature, which one opponent of these laws, the [[Guttmacher Institute]] founded by Planned Parenthood, has called "generally irrelevant" and not in line "with the current medical literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gold Rachel Benson |author2=Nash Elizabeth | year = 2007 | title = State Abortion Counseling Policies and the Fundamental Principles of Informed Consent | url = http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/10/4/gpr100406.html | journal = Guttmacher Policy Review | volume = 10 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Caplan|Dr. Arthur Caplan]], director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, said laws such as these "reduce... the process of informed consent to the reading of a fixed script created and mandated by politicians not doctors."&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Caplan|Caplan, Arthur]].

'''Semantic memory''' is one of the two types of [[declarative memory|declarative]] or [[explicit memory]] (our memory of facts or events that is explicitly stored and retrieved).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Squire|first1=L|title=Declarative and Nondeclarative Memory: Multiple Brain Systems Supporting Learning and Memory|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=1992|volume=4|issue=3|pages=232–243|doi=10.1162/jocn.1992.4.3.232|pmid=23964880}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semantic memory refers to general world [[knowledge]] that we have accumulated throughout our lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McRae|first1=Ken|last2=Jones|first2=Michael|chapter=Semantic Memory|editor1-last=Reisberg|editor1-first=Daniel|title=The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Psychology|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780195376746|pages=206–216}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[general knowledge]] (facts, ideas, meaning and concepts) is intertwined in experience and dependent on [[culture]]. Semantic memory is distinct from [[episodic memory]], which is our memory of experiences and specific events that occur during our lives, from which we can recreate at any given point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tulving|first1=Endel|title=Episodic Memory: From Mind to Brain|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=2002|volume=53|pages=1–25|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135114|pmid=11752477}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, semantic memory might contain information about what a cat is, whereas episodic memory might contain a specific memory of petting a particular cat. We can learn about new concepts by applying our knowledge learned from things in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saumier | first1 = D. | last2 = Chertkow | first2 = H. | year = 2002 | title = Semantic Memory | url = | journal = Current Science | volume = 2 | issue = 6| pages = 516–522 | doi=10.1007/s11910-002-0039-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The counterpart to declarative or explicit memory is [[Non-declarative memory|nondeclarative memory]] or [[implicit memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tulving | first1 = E. | last2 = Schacter | first2 = D.L. | year = 1990 | title = Priming and human memory systems.

== History ==
The idea of semantic memory was first introduced following a conference in 1972 between [[Endel Tulving]], of the [[University of Toronto]], and W. Donaldson on the role of organization in human memory. Tulving constructed a proposal to distinguish between [[episodic memory]] and what he termed semantic memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Stanley B|title=Episodic Memory and Autonoetic Awareness|journal=Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience|date=2013|volume=7|issue=3|pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was mainly influenced by the ideas of Reiff and Scheers, who in 1959 made the distinction between two primary forms of memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reif|first1=R|last2=Scheerer|first2=M|title=Memory and [[age regression in therapy|Hypnotic Age Regression]]: Developmental Aspects of Cognitive Function Explored Through Hypnosis|date=1959|publisher=International Universities Press|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; One form was entitled "remembrances", the other "memoria". The remembrance concept dealt with memories that contained experiences of an autobiographic index, whereas the [[memoria]] concept dealt with those memories that did not reference experiences having an autobiographic index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramachandran|first1=V.S.|title=Memory|journal=Encyclopedia of Human Behavior|date=1994|volume=1|pages=137–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semantic memory reflects our knowledge of the world around us, hence the term 'general knowledge' is often used. It holds generic information that is more than likely acquired across various contexts and is used across different situations. According to Madigan in his book titled ''Memory'', semantic memory is the sum of all knowledge one has obtained—whether it be vocabulary, understanding of math, or all the facts one knows. In his book titled "Episodic and Semantic Memory", Endel Tulving adopted the term "semantic" from linguists to refer to a system of memory for "words and verbal symbols, their meanings and referents, the relations between them, and the rules, formulas, or algorithms for influencing them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tulving|first1=Endel|title=Episodic and Semantic Memory: Organization of Memory|date=1972|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York, NY|pages=382–403|edition=E. Tulving &amp; W. Donaldson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of semantic memory is quite different from that of episodic memory. Semantic memory refers to general facts and meanings one shares with others whereas episodic memory refers to unique and concrete personal experiences. 
Tulving's proposal of this distinction between semantic and episodic memory was widely accepted, primarily because it allowed the separate conceptualization of knowledge of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tulving|first1=Endel|title=Episodic and Semantic Memory|journal=The Social Sciences Citation Index: Citation Classic|date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tulving discusses conceptions of episodic and semantic memory in his book titled Elements of Episodic Memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tulving|first1=Endel|title=Precise of Elements of Episodic Memory|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=1984|volume=7|issue=2|pages=223–268|doi=10.1017/s0140525x0004440x}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he states that several factors differentiate episodic memory and semantic memory in ways that include

# the characteristics of their operations,
# the kind of information they process, 
# their application to the real world as well as the memory laboratory.

Before Tulving's proposal, this area of human memory had been neglected by experimental [[psychologists]]. Since Tulvings inception of these distinctions, several experimenters have conducted tests to determine the validity of his hypothesized differences between episodic and semantic memory.

Recent research has focused on the idea that when people access a word's meaning, sensorimotor information that is used to perceive and act on the concrete object the word suggests is automatically activated. In the theory of [[grounded cognition]], the meaning of a particular word is grounded in the sensorimotor systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pecher|first1=D|last2=Zwann|first2=R.A.|title=Grounding Cognition: The Role of Perception and Action in Memory, Language, and Thinking|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when one thinks of a pear, knowledge of grasping, chewing, sights, sounds, and tastes used to encode episodic experiences of a pear are recalled through sensorimotor simulation. A grounded simulation approach refers to context-specific re-activations that integrate the important features of episodic experience into a current depiction. Such research has challenged previously utilized amodal views. The brain encodes multiple inputs such as words and pictures to integrate and create a larger conceptual idea by using amodal views (also known as [[amodal perceptions]]. Instead of being representations in modality-specific systems, semantic memory representations had previously been viewed as redescriptions of modality-specific states. Some accounts of category-specific semantic deficits that are amodal remain even though researchers are beginning to find support for theories in which knowledge is tied to modality-specific brain regions. This research defines a clear link between episodic experiences and semantic memory. The concept that semantic representations are grounded across modality-specific brain regions can be supported by the fact that episodic and semantic memory appear to function in different yet mutually dependent ways. The distinction between semantic and episodic memory has become a part of the broader scientific discourse. For example, it has been speculated that semantic memory captures the stable aspects of our personality while episodes of illness may have a more episodic nature.&lt;ref name="Ormel2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Ormel, J., Laceulle, O.M., Jeronimus, B.F. |year=2014|title= Why Personality and Psychopathology Are Correlated: A Developmental Perspective Is a First Step but More Is Needed|journal= European Journal of Personality|volume=28|issue=4|pages=396–98|doi=10.1002/per.1971|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265162278_Why_Personality_and_Psychopathology_Are_Correlated_A_Developmental_Perspective_Is_a_First_Step_but_More_Is_Needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This study was not created to solely provide evidence for the distinction of semantic and episodic memory stores. However, they did use the experimental dissociation method which provides evidence for Tulving's hypothesis.

''Part one''

Subjects were presented with 60 words (one at a time) and were asked different questions.

* Some questions asked were to cause the subject to pay attention to the visual '''appearance''': Is the word typed in bold letters?
* Some questions caused the participants to pay attention to the '''sound''' of the word: Does the word rhyme with ball?
* Some questions caused the subjects to pay attention to the '''meaning''' of the word: Does the word refer to a form of communication?
* Half of the questions were "no" answers and the other half "yes"

''Part Two''

In the second phase of the experiment, 60 "old words" seen in stage one and "20 new words" not shown in stage one were presented to the subjects one at a time.

The subjects were given one of two tasks:

* ''Perceptual Identification task (semantic)'': The words were flashed on a video-screen for 35ms and the subjects were required to say what the word was.
* ''Episodic Recognition Task'': Subjects were presented with each word and had to decide whether they had seen the word in the previous stage of the experiment.

;Results:

* The percentages correct in the Semantic task (perceptual identification) did not change with the encoding conditions of appearance, sound, or meaning.
* The percentages for the episodic task increased from the appearance condition (.50), to the sound condition (.63), to the meaning condition (.86). – The effect was also greater for the "yes" encoding words than the "no" encoding words. (see stage one)

;Conclusion:

It displays a strong distinction of performance of episodic and semantic tasks, thus supporting Tulving's hypothesis.

== Models ==
The essence of semantic memory is that its contents are not tied to any particular instance of experience, as in episodic memory. Instead, what is stored in semantic memory is the "gist" of experience, an abstract structure that applies to a wide variety of experiential objects and delineates categorical and functional relationships between such objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kintsch | first1 = W | year = 1988 | title = The role of knowledge in discourse comprehension: A construction-integration model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 95 | issue = 2| pages = 163–182 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.95.2.163| pmid = 3375398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, a complete theory of semantic memory must account not only for the representational structure of such "gists", but also for how they can be extracted from experience. Numerous models of semantic memory have been proposed; they are summarized below.

=== Network models ===
[[Neural network|Networks]] of various sorts play an integral part in many theories of semantic memory. Generally speaking, a network is composed of a set of nodes connected by links. The nodes may represent concepts, words, perceptual features, or nothing at all. The links may be weighted such that some are stronger than others or, equivalently, have a length such that some links take longer to traverse than others. All these features of networks have been employed in models of semantic memory, examples of which are found below.

====Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC)====
One of the first examples of a network model of semantic memory is the Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Collins | first1 = A. M. | last2 = Quillian | first2 = M. R. | year = 1969 | title = Retrieval time from semantic memory | url = | journal = Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 240–247 | doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(69)80069-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this model, each node is a word, representing a concept (like "Bird"). With each node is stored a set of properties (like "can fly" or "has wings") as well as pointers (i.e., links) to other nodes (like "Chicken"). A node is directly linked to those nodes of which it is either a subclass or superclass (i.e., "Bird" would be connected to both "Chicken" and "Animal"). Thus, TLC is a hierarchical knowledge representation in that high-level nodes representing large categories are connected (directly or indirectly, via the nodes of subclasses) to many instances of those categories, whereas nodes representing specific instances are at a lower level, connected only to their superclasses. Furthermore, properties are stored at the highest category level to which they apply. For example, "is yellow" would be stored with "Canary", "has wings" would be stored with "Bird" (one level up), and "can move" would be stored with "Animal" (another level up). Nodes may also store negations of the properties of their superordinate nodes (i.e., "NOT-can fly" would be stored with "penguin"). This provides an economy of representation in that properties are only stored at the category level at which they become essential, that is, at which point they become critical features (see below).

Processing in TLC is a form of [[spreading activation]].&lt;ref&gt;Collins, A. M. &amp; Quillian, M. R. (1972). How to make a language user. In E. Tulving &amp; W. Donaldson (Eds.), ''Organization of memory'' (pp. 309-351). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, when a node becomes active, that activation spreads to other nodes via the links between them. In that case, the time to answer the question "Is a chicken a bird?" is a function of how far the activation between the nodes for "Chicken" and "Bird" must spread, i.e., the number of links between the nodes "Chicken" and "Bird".

The original version of TLC did not put weights on the links between nodes. This version performed comparably to humans in many tasks, but failed to predict that people would respond faster to questions regarding more typical category instances than those involving less typical instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rips | first1 = L. J. | last2 = Shoben | first2 = E. J. | last3 = Smith | first3 = F. E. | year = 1973 | title = Semantic distance and the verification of semantic relations | url = | journal = Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 665–681 | doi = 10.1016/s0022-5371(73)80056-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allan M. Collins|Collins]] and Quillian later updated TLC to include weighted connections to account for this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Collins | first1 = A. M. | last2 = Loftus | first2 = E. F. | year = 1975 | title = A spreading-activation theory of semantic processing | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 82 | issue = 6| pages = 407–428 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.82.6.407}}&lt;/ref&gt; This updated TLC is capable of explaining both the [[familiarity effect]] and the [[typicality effect]]. Its biggest advantage is that it clearly explains [[priming (psychology)|priming]]: you are more likely to retrieve information from memory if related information (the "prime") has been presented a short time before. There are still a number of memory phenomena for which TLC has no account, including why people are able to respond quickly to obviously false questions (like "is a chicken a meteor?"), when the relevant nodes are very far apart in the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glass | first1 = A. L. | last2 = Holyoak | first2 = K. J. | last3 = Kiger | first3 = J. I. | year = 1979 | title = Role of antonymy relations in semantic judgments | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning &amp; Memory | volume = 5 | issue = 6| pages = 598–606 | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.5.6.598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Semantic networks====
TLC is an instance of a more general class of models known as [[semantic networks]]. In a semantic network, each node is to be interpreted as representing a specific concept, word, or feature. That is, each node is a symbol. Semantic networks generally do not employ distributed representations for concepts, as may be found in a [[neural network]]. The defining feature of a semantic network is that its links are almost always directed (that is, they only point in one direction, from a base to a target) and the links come in many different types, each one standing for a particular relationship that can hold between any two nodes.&lt;ref&gt;Arbib, M. A. (Ed.). (2002). Semantic networks. In ''The Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks (2nd ed.)'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Processing in a semantic network often takes the form of spreading activation (see above).

Semantic networks see the most use in models of [[Discourse analysis|discourse]] and [[logic]]al [[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]], as well as in [[Artificial Intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;Barr, A. &amp; Feigenbaum, E. A. (1982). ''The handbook of artificial intelligence''. Lost Altos, CA: William Kaufman.&lt;/ref&gt; In these models, the nodes correspond to words or word stems and the links represent syntactic relations between them. For an example of a computational implementation of semantic networks in knowledge representation, see Cravo and Martins (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cravo | first1 = M. R. | last2 = Martins | first2 = J. P. | year = 1993 | title = SNePSwD: A newcomer to the SNePS family | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental &amp; Theoretical Artificial Intelligence | volume = 5 | issue = 2–3| pages = 135–148 | doi=10.1080/09528139308953764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feature models===
Feature models view semantic categories as being composed of relatively unstructured sets of features. The [[semantic feature-comparison model]], proposed by Smith, Shoben, and Rips (1974),&lt;ref name="Smith, E. E. 1974"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = E. E. | last2 = Shoben | first2 = E. J. | last3 = Rips | first3 = L. J. | year = 1974 | title = Structure and process in semantic memory: A featural model for semantic decisions | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 81 | issue = 3| pages = 214–241 | doi=10.1037/h0036351}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes memory as being composed of feature lists for different concepts. According to this view, the relations between categories would not be directly retrieved, they would be indirectly computed. For example, subjects might verify a sentence by comparing the feature sets that represent its subject and predicate concepts. Such computational feature-comparison models include the ones proposed by Meyer (1970),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meyer | first1 = D. E. | year = 1970 | title = On the representation and retrieval of stored semantic information | url = | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 242–299 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(70)90017-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rips (1975),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rips | first1 = L. J. | year = 1975 | title = Inductive judgments about natural categories | url = | journal = Journal of Verbal Learning &amp; Verbal Behavior | volume = 14 | issue = 6| pages = 665–681 | doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(75)80055-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith, et al. (1974).&lt;ref name="Smith, E. E. 1974"/&gt;

Early work in perceptual and conceptual categorization assumed that categories had critical features and that category membership could be determined by logical rules for the combination of features. More recent theories have accepted that categories may have an ill-defined or "fuzzy" structure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCloskey | first1 = M. E. | last2 = Glucksberg | first2 = S. | year = 1978 | title = Natural categories: Well defined or fuzzy sets? | url = | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 6 | issue = 4| pages = 462–472 | doi=10.3758/bf03197480}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have proposed probabilistic or global similarity models for the verification of category membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCloskey | first1 = M. | last2 = Glucksberg | first2 = S. | year = 1979 | title = Decision processes in verifying category membership statements: Implications for models of semantic memory | url = | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 1–37 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(79)90002-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associative models===
The "[[Association (psychology)|association]]"—a relationship between two pieces of information—is a fundamental concept in psychology, and associations at various levels of mental representation are essential to models of memory and cognition in general. The set of associations among a collection of items in memory is equivalent to the links between nodes in a network, where each node corresponds to a unique item in memory. Indeed, neural networks and semantic networks may be characterized as associative models of cognition. However, associations are often more clearly represented as an ''N''×''N'' matrix, where ''N'' is the number of items in memory. Thus, each cell of the matrix corresponds to the strength of the association between the row item and the column item.

Learning of associations is generally believed to be a [[Hebbian]] process; that is, whenever two items in memory are simultaneously active, the association between them grows stronger, and the more likely either item is to activate the other. See below for specific operationalizations of associative models.

====Search of Associative Memory (SAM)====
A standard model of memory that employs association in this manner is the Search of Associative Memory (SAM) model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last1=Raaijmakers | first1=J. G. W. | last2=Schiffrin | first2=R. M. | publication-date=1981 |year=1981 |title=Search of associative memory | periodical=Psychological Review |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=98–134 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though SAM was originally designed to model episodic memory, its mechanisms are sufficient to support some semantic memory representations, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, D. R., Smith, T. A. &amp; Kahana, M. J. (in press). The fSAM model of false recall. ''Psychological Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; The SAM model contains a short- term store (STS) and long term store (LTS), where STS is a briefly activated subset of the information in the LTS.   The STS has limited capacity and affects the retrieval process by limiting the amount of information that can be sampled and limiting the time the sampled subset is in an active mode.  The retrieval process in LTS is cue dependent and probabilistic, meaning that a cue initiates the retrieval process and the selected information from memory is random.  The probability of being sampled is dependent on the strength of association between the cue and the item being retrieved, with stronger associations being sampled and finally one is chosen.  The buffer size is defined as r, and not a fixed number, and as items are rehearsed in the buffer the associative strengths grow linearly as a function of the total time inside the buffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raaijmakers|first=J.G.|author2=Shiffrin R.M. |title=SAM: A theory of probabilistic search of associative memory|journal=The Psychology of Learning and Motivation: Advances in Research and Theory|year=1980|volume=14|pages=207–262|doi=10.1016/s0079-7421(08)60162-0|series=Psychology of Learning and Motivation|isbn=9780125433143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In SAM, when any two items simultaneously occupy a working memory buffer, the strength of their association is incremented. Thus, items that co-occur more often are more strongly associated. Items in SAM are also associated with a specific context, where the strength of that association determined by how long each item is present in a given context. In SAM, then, memories consist of a set of associations between items in memory and between items and contexts. The presence of a set of items and/or a context is more likely to evoke, then, some subset of the items in memory. The degree to which items evoke one another—either by virtue of their shared context or their co-occurrence—is an indication of the items' [[semantic relatedness]].

In an updated version of SAM, pre-existing semantic associations are accounted for using a semantic [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].   During the experiment, semantic associations remain fixed showing the assumption that semantic associations are not significantly impacted by the episodic experience of one experiment.  The two measures used to measure semantic relatedness in this model are the Latent semantic analysis (LSA) and the Word association spaces (WAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sirotin|first=Y.B.|author2=Kahana, d. R |title=Going beyond a single list: Modeling the effects of prior experience on episodic free recall|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|year=2005|volume=12|issue=5|pages=787–805|doi=10.3758/bf03196773}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LSA method states that similarity between words is reflected through their co-occurrence in a local context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Landauer, T.K|author2=Dumais S.T. |title=Solution to Plato's problem: the latent semantic analysis theory of acquisition, induction, and representation of knowledge|journal=Psychological Review|volume=104|issue=2 |pages=211–240|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.104.2.211|year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; WAS was developed by analyzing a database of free association norms.  In WAS, "words that have similar associative structures are placed in similar regions of space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=237–249|doi=10.1037/10895-018|chapter=Word Association Spaces for Predicting Semantic Similarity Effects in Episodic Memory|title=Experimental Cognitive Psychology and Its Applications|year=2005|last1=Steyvers|first1=Mark|last2=Shiffrin|first2=Richard M.|last3=Nelson|first3=Douglas L.|isbn=978-1-59147-183-7|chapter-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609210806/http://psiexp.ss.uci.edu/research/papers/SteyversShiffrinNelsonFormatted.pdf|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/books/4318016.aspx|editor-first1= Alice F. |editor-last1=Healy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====ACT-R: a production system model====
The ACT (Adaptive Control of Thought)&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R. (1983). ''The Architecture of Cognition''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (and later [[ACT-R]] (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational)&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R. (1993b). ''Rules of the mind''. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;) theory of cognition represents [[declarative memory]] (of which semantic memory is a part) with "chunks", which consist of a label, a set of defined relationships to other chunks (i.e., "this is a _", or "this has a _"), and any number of chunk-specific properties. Chunks, then, can be mapped as a semantic network, given that each node is a chunk with its unique properties, and each link is the chunk's relationship to another chunk. In ACT, a chunk's activation decreases as a function of the time since the chunk was created and increases with the number of times the chunk has been retrieved from memory. Chunks can also receive activation from [[Gaussian]] [[noise]], and from their similarity to other chunks. For example, if "chicken" is used as a retrieval cue, "canary" will receive activation by virtue of its similarity to the cue (i.e., both are birds, etc.). When retrieving items from memory, ACT looks at the most active chunk in memory; if it is above threshold, it is retrieved, otherwise an "error of omission" has occurred, i.e., the item has been forgotten. There is, additionally, a retrieval latency, which varies inversely with the amount by which the activation of the retrieved chunk exceeds the retrieval threshold. This latency is used in measuring the response time of the ACT model, to compare it to human performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Bothell | first2 = D. | last3 = Lebiere | first3 = C. | last4 = Matessa | first4 = M. | year = 1998 | title = An integrated theory of list memory | url = | journal = Journal of Memory and Language | volume = 38 | issue = 4| pages = 341–380 | doi=10.1006/jmla.1997.2553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ACT is a model of cognition in general, and not memory in particular, it nonetheless posits certain features of the structure of memory, as described above. In particular, ACT models memory as a set of related symbolic chunks which may be accessed by retrieval cues. While the model of memory employed in ACT is similar in some ways to a semantic network, the processing involved is more akin to an associative model.

===Statistical models===
Some models characterize the acquisition of semantic information as a form of [[statistical inference]] from a set of discrete experiences, distributed across a number of "[[Context (language use)|contexts]]". Though these models differ in specifics, they generally employ an (Item × Context) [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] where each cell represents the number of times an item in memory has occurred in a given context. Semantic information is gleaned by performing a statistical analysis of this matrix.

Many of these models bear similarity to the algorithms used in [[search engines]] (for example, see Griffiths, ''et al.'', 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Griffiths | first1 = T. L. | last2 = Steyvers | first2 = M. | last3 = Firl | first3 = A. | year = 2007 | title = Google and the mind: Predicting fluency with PageRank | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 18 | issue = 12| pages = 1069–1076 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.02027.x| pmid = 18031414 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Anderson, 1990&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R. (1990). ''The adaptive character of thought''. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;), though it is not yet clear whether they really use the same computational mechanisms.

====Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)====
Perhaps the most popular of these models is [[Latent semantic analysis|Latent Semantic Analysis]] (LSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Landauer | first1 = T. K. | last2 = Dumais | first2 = S. T. | year = 1997 | title = A solution to Plato's problem: The Latent Semantic Analysis theory of the acquisition, induction, and representation of knowledge | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 104 | issue = 2| pages = 211–240 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.104.2.211}}&lt;/ref&gt; In LSA, a T × D [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is constructed from a text corpus where T is the number of terms in the corpus and D is the number of documents (here "context" is interpreted as "document" and only words—or word phrases—are considered as items in memory). Each cell in the matrix is then transformed according to the equation:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}_{t,d}'=\frac{\ln{(1 + \mathbf{M}_{t,d})}}{-\sum_{i=0}^D P(i|t) \ln{P(i|t)}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P(i|t)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that context &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is active, given that item &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; has occurred (this is obtained simply by dividing the raw frequency, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}_{t,d}&lt;/math&gt; by the total of the item vector, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^D \mathbf{M}_{t,i}&lt;/math&gt;). This transformation—applying the [[logarithm]], then dividing by the [[information entropy]] of the item over all contexts—provides for greater differentiation between items and effectively weights items by their ability to predict context, and vice versa (that is, items that appear across many contexts, like "the" or "and", will be weighted less, reflecting their lack of semantic information). A [[Singular Value Decomposition]] (SVD) is then performed on the matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}'&lt;/math&gt;, which allows the number of dimensions in the matrix to be reduced, thus clustering LSA's semantic representations and providing for indirect association between items. For example, "cat" and "dog" may never appear together in the same context, so their close semantic relationship may not be well-captured by LSA's original matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt;. However, by performing the SVD and reducing the number of dimensions in the matrix, the context vectors of "cat" and "dog"—which would be very similar—would migrate toward one another and perhaps merge, thus allowing "cat" and "dog" to act as retrieval cues for each other, even though they may never have co-occurred. The degree of semantic relatedness of items in memory is given by the cosine of the angle between the items' context vectors (ranging from 1 for perfect synonyms to 0 for no relationship). Essentially, then, two words are closely semantically related if they appear in similar types of documents.

====Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL)====
The Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) model&lt;ref&gt;Lund, K., Burgess, C. &amp; Atchley, R. A. (1995). Semantic and associative priming in a high-dimensional semantic space. ''Cognitive Science Proceedings (LEA)'', 660-665.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lund | first1 = K. | last2 = Burgess | first2 = C. | year = 1996 | title = Producing high-dimensional semantic spaces from lexical co-occurrence | url = | journal = Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, and Computers | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 203–208 | doi=10.3758/bf03204766}}&lt;/ref&gt; considers context only as the words that immediately surround a given word. HAL computes an NxN matrix, where N is the number of words in its lexicon, using a 10-word reading frame that moves incrementally through a corpus of text. Like in SAM (see above), any time two words are simultaneously in the frame, the association between them is increased, that is, the corresponding cell in the NxN matrix is incremented. The bigger the distance between the two words, the smaller the amount by which the association is incremented (specifically, &lt;math&gt;\Delta=11-d&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the two words in the frame). As in [[Latent semantic analysis|LSA]] (see above), the semantic similarity between two words is given by the cosine of the angle between their vectors ([[dimension reduction]] may be performed on this matrix, as well). In HAL, then, two words are semantically related if they tend to appear with the same words. Note that this may hold true even when the words being compared never actually co-occur (i.e., "chicken" and "canary").

====Other statistical models of semantic memory====
The success of LSA and HAL gave birth to a whole field of statistical models of language. A more up-to-date list of such models may be found under the topic [[Measures of semantic relatedness]].

== Location of semantic memory in the brain ==
The [[cognitive neuroscience]] of semantic memory is a somewhat controversial issue with two dominant views.

On the one hand, many researchers and clinicians believe that semantic memory is stored by the same [[brain]] systems involved in [[episodic memory]]. These include the medial [[temporal lobes]] (MTL) and [[hippocampus|hippocampal formation]]. In this system, the hippocampal formation "encodes" memories, or makes it possible for memories to form at all, and the cortex stores memories after the initial encoding process is completed.

Recently, new evidence has been presented in support of a more precise interpretation of this hypothesis. The hippocampal formation includes, among other structures: the hippocampus itself, the [[entorhinal cortex]], and the perirhinal cortex. These latter two make up the "parahippocampal cortices". Amnesics with damage to the hippocampus but some spared parahippocampal cortex were able to demonstrate some degree of intact semantic memory despite a total loss of episodic memory. This strongly suggests that encoding of information leading to semantic memory does not have its physiological basis in the hippocampus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vargha-Khadem | display-authors = etal   | year = 1997 | title = Differential Effects of Early Hippocampal Pathology on Episodic and Semantic Memory | url = | journal = Science | volume = 277 | issue = 5324| pages = 376–380 | doi=10.1126/science.277.5324.376 | pmid=9219696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers believe the [[hippocampus]] is only involved in [[episodic memory]] and spatial [[cognition]]. This then raises the question where semantic memory may be located. Some believe semantic memory lives in temporal [[neocortex]]. Others believe that semantic knowledge is widely distributed across all brain areas. To illustrate this latter view, consider your knowledge of dogs. Researchers holding the 'distributed semantic knowledge' view believe that your knowledge of the sound a dog makes exists in your [[auditory cortex]], whilst your ability to recognize and imagine the visual features of a dog resides in your [[visual cortex]]. Recent evidence supports the idea that the [[temporal pole]] bilaterally is the convergence zone for unimodal semantic representations into a multimodal representation.  These regions are particularly vulnerable to damage in [[semantic dementia]], which is characterised by a global semantic deficit.

== Neural correlates and biological workings ==
The hippocampal areas are important to semantic memory's involvement with declarative memory. The left inferior [[prefrontal cortex]] (PFC) and the left posterior [[Temporal lobe|temporal]] areas are other areas involved in semantic memory use. [[Temporal lobe]] damage affecting the lateral and medial cortexes have been related to semantic impairments. Damage to different areas of the brain affect semantic memory differently.&lt;ref name="Autobiographical, Episodic 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burianova | first1 = H. | last2 = Grady | first2 = C. L. | year = 2007 | title = Common and Unique Neural Activations in Autobiographical, Episodic, and Semantic Retrieval | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 19 | issue = 9| pages = 1520–34 | doi=10.1162/jocn.2007.19.9.1520| pmid = 17714013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuroimaging evidence suggests that left hippocampal areas show an increase in activity during semantic memory tasks. During semantic retrieval, two regions in the right [[middle frontal gyrus]] and the area of the right inferior temporal gyrus similarly show an increase in activity.&lt;ref name="Autobiographical, Episodic 2007"/&gt; Damage to areas involved in semantic memory result in various deficits, depending on the area and type of damage. For instance, Lambon Ralph, Lowe, &amp; Rogers (2007) found that category-specific impairments can occur where patients have different knowledge deficits for one semantic category over another, depending on location and type of damage. Category-specific impairments might indicate that knowledge may rely differentially upon sensory and motor properties encoded in separate areas (Farah and McClelland, 1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lambon Ralph | first1 = M. | last2 = Lowe | first2 = C. | last3 = Rogers | first3 = T.T. | year = 2007 | title = Neural Basis of Category-specific Semantic Deficits for Living Things: Evidence from semantic dementia, HSVE and a Neural Network Model | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 130 | issue = 4| pages = 1127–37 | doi=10.1093/brain/awm025 | pmid=17438021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Category-specific impairments can involve cortical regions where living and nonliving things are represented and where feature and conceptual relationships are represented. Depending on the damage to the semantic system, one type might be favored over the other. In many cases, there is a point where one domain is better than the other (i.e. - representation of living and nonliving things over feature and conceptual relationships or vice versa)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garrard | display-authors = etal   | year = 2001 | title = Longitudinal Profiles of Semantic Impairment for Living and Nonliving Concepts in Dementia of Alzheimer's Type | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 13 | issue = 7| pages = 892–909 | doi=10.1162/089892901753165818| pmid = 11595093   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different diseases and disorders can affect the biological workings of semantic memory. A variety of studies have been done in an attempt to determine the effects on varying aspects of semantic memory. For example, Lambon, Lowe, &amp; Rogers (2007) studied the different effects [[semantic dementia]] and herpes simplex virus encephalitis have on semantic memory. They found that semantic dementia has a more generalized semantic impairment. Additionally, deficits in semantic memory as a result of herpes simplex virus encephalitis tend to have more category-specific impairments. Other disorders that affect semantic memory - such as [[Alzheimer's disease]] - has been observed clinically as errors in naming, recognizing, or describing objects. Whereas researchers have attributed such impairment to degradation of semantic knowledge (Koenig et al. 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lambon | first1 = R. | last2 = Matthew | first2 = A. | year = 2007 | title = Neural Basis of Category-specific Semantic Deficits for Living Things: Evidence from semantic dementia, HSVE and a Neural Network Model | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 130 | issue = 4| pages = 1127–37 | doi=10.1093/brain/awm025 | pmid=17438021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various neural imaging and research points to semantic memory and [[episodic memory]] resulting from distinct areas in the brain. Still other research suggests that both semantic memory and [[episodic memory]] are part of a singular [[declarative memory]] system, yet represent different sectors and parts within the greater whole. Different areas within the brain are activated depending on whether semantic or [[episodic memory]] is accessed. Certain experts are still arguing whether or not the two types of memory are from distinct systems or whether the neural imaging makes it appear that way as a result of the activation of different mental processes during retrieval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rajah | first1 = M.N. | last2 = McIntosh | first2 = A.R. | year = 2005 | title = Overlap in the Functional Neural Systems Involved in Semantic and Episodic Memory Retrieval | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 470–482 | doi=10.1162/0898929053279478| pmid = 15814006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disorders==
In order to understand semantic memory disorders, one must first understand how these disorders affect memory. Semantic memory disorders fractionate into two categories. Semantic category specific impairments and modality specific impairments are apparent in disorders of semantic memory. Understanding these types of impairments will give insight into how disorders of semantic memory function.

===Semantic category specific impairments===
Category specific impairments can result in widespread, patchy damage or localized damage. Category specific impairments can be broken down into four categories. Perceptual and functional features, topographic organization, informativeness and intercorrelations are areas of decreased functioning in disorders of semantic memory (Warrington and Shallice, 1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Warrington | first1 = E. K. | last2 = Shallice | first2 = T. | year = 1984 | title = Category specific semantic impairments | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 107 | issue = 3| pages = 829–853 | doi=10.1093/brain/107.3.829 | pmid=6206910}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alzheimer's disease]] is a semantic memory disorder that results in errors describing and naming objects, though not necessarily category-specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laws | first1 = KR | last2 = Adlington | first2 = RL | last3 = Gale | first3 = TM | last4 = Moreno-Martinez | first4 = FJ | last5 = Sartori | first5 = G | year = 2007 | title = A meta-analytic review of category naming in Alzheimer's disease | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 45 | issue = 12| pages = 2674–82 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.04.003| pmid = 17499818 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Semantic dementia is another disorder associated with semantic memory. [[Semantic dementia]] is a [[language]] disorder characterized by a deterioration in understanding and recognizing words. Impairments include difficulty in generating familiar words, difficulty naming objects and difficulties with visual recognition. Research suggests that the temporal lobe might be responsible for category specific impairments of semantic memory disorders. In addition to category specific impairments, modality specific impairments are included in disorders of semantic memory (Cohen et al. 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, G., Johnston, R. &amp; Plunkett, K. (2002). Exploring cognition: Damaged brains and neural networks. Erlbaum: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modality specific impairments===
Semantic memory is also discussed in reference to [[Stimulus modality|modality]]. Different components represent information from different sensorimotor channels. Modality specific impairments are divided into separate subsystems on the basis of input modality. Examples of different input modalities include visual, auditory and tactile input. Modality specific impairments are also divided into subsystems based on the type of information. Visual vs. verbal and perceptual vs. functional information are examples of information types.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, T., Brennen, T. &amp; Bredart, S. (1996). ''The Cognitive psychology of proper names: On the importance of being ernest''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Modality specificity can account for category specific impairments in semantic memory disorders. Damage to visual semantics primarily impairs knowledge of living things, and damage to functional semantics primarily impairs knowledge of nonliving things.

===Semantic refractory access and semantic storage disorders===
Semantic memory disorders fall into two groups. Semantic refractory access disorders are contrasted with semantic storage disorders according to four factors. Temporal factors, response consistency, frequency and semantic relatedness are the four factors used to differentiate between semantic refractory access and semantic storage disorders. A key feature of semantic refractory access disorders is temporal distortions. Decreases in response time to certain stimuli are noted when compared to natural response times. Response consistency is the next factor. In access disorders you see inconsistencies in comprehending and responding to stimuli that have been presented many times. Temporal factors impact response consistency. In storage disorders, you do not see an inconsistent response to specific items like you do in refractory access disorders. Stimulus frequency determines performance at all stages of cognition. Extreme word frequency effects are common in semantic storage disorders while in semantic refractory access disorders word frequency effects are minimal. The comparison of 'close' and 'distant' groups tests semantic relatedness. 'Close' groupings have words that are related because they are drawn from the same category. For example, a listing of clothing types would be a 'close' grouping. 'Distant' groupings contain words with broad categorical differences. Non-related words would fall into this group. Comparing close and distant groups shows that in access disorders semantic relatedness had a negative effect. This is not observed in semantic storage disorders. Category specific and modality specific impairments are important components in access and storage disorders of semantic memory.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, R. (1995). Semantic knowledge and semantic representations. Erlbaum: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present and future research ==
Semantic memory has had a comeback in interest in the past 15 years, due in part to the development of functional [[neuroimaging]] methods such as [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), which have been used to address some of the central questions about our understanding of semantic memory.

Positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) allow [[cognitive]] neuroscientists to explore different hypotheses concerning the neural network organization of semantic memory. By using these neuroimaging techniques researchers can observe the brain activity of participants while they perform cognitive tasks. These tasks can include, but are not limited to, naming objects, deciding if two stimuli belong in the same object category, or matching pictures to their written or spoken names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eiling|first1=Yee|last2=Chrysikou|first2=Evangelia G|last3=Thompson-Schill|first3=Sharon L|title=The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=2013|publisher=Oxford UP|location=New York, NY|pages=353–369|chapter=Semantic Memory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than any one brain region playing a dedicated and privileged role in the representation or retrieval of all sorts of semantic knowledge, semantic memory is a collection of functionally and anatomically distinct systems, where each attribute-specific system is tied to a [[sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] [[Stimulus modality|modality]] (i.e. vision) and even more specifically to a property within that modality (i.e. [[color]]).  [[Neuroimaging]] studies also suggest a distinction between semantic processing and sensorimotor processing.

A new idea that is still at the early stages of development is that semantic memory, like perception, can be subdivided into types of visual information—color, size, form, and motion. Thompson-Schill (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson-Schill | first1 = S.L. | year = 2003 | title = Neuroimaging studies of semantic memory: inferring "how" from "where" | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 41 | issue = 3| pages = 280–292 | doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(02)00161-6| pmid = 12457754 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the left or bilateral ventral [[temporal cortex]] appears to be involved in retrieval of knowledge of color and form, the left lateral temporal cortex in knowledge of motion, and the [[parietal cortex]] in knowledge of size.

Neuroimaging studies suggest a large, distributed network of semantic representations that are organized minimally by attribute, and perhaps additionally by category. These networks include "extensive regions of ventral (form and color knowledge) and lateral (motion knowledge) [[temporal cortex]], [[parietal cortex]] (size knowledge), and [[premotor cortex]] (manipulation knowledge). Other areas, such as more anterior regions of temporal cortex, may be involved in the representation of nonperceptual (e.g. verbal) conceptual knowledge, perhaps in some categorically-organized fashion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson-Schill | first1 = S.L. | year = 2003 | title = Neuroimaging studies of semantic memory: inferring "how" from "where" | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 41 | issue = 3| pages = 280–92| doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(02)00161-6 | pmid=12457754}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that within the temperoparietal network, the anterior temporal lobe is relatively more important for semantic processing, and posterior language regions are relatively more important for lexical retrieval.

[[File:Stanley Leighton.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Leighton in 1895.]]
'''Stanley Leighton''' (1837 &amp;ndash; 4 May 1901) was an English barrister, landowner, artist and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician. He is also known as an antiquarian and author.
    
==Life==
Leighton was the younger son of [[Sir Baldwin Leighton, 7th Baronet]], of Loton Park, and his wife Mary Parker. He was educated at [[Harrow School]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. He then attended [[Inner Temple]] and was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] on 18 November 1861, proceeding to the [[Oxford Circuit]]. In 1867 he travelled to the colonies with his friend and fellow-barrister, Rees Davies. His diaries record a trip to India and Ceylon in 1867-1868 and the pair visited Australia in 1868 where Leighton produced many original sketches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/nlanews/2008/jun08/story-1.pdf Judging progress towards a civilised society - Stanley Leighton’s colonial Australian tour, 1868]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869 his father passed on to him the Sweeney estate at [[Oswestry]] which had come to his mother through the Parker family. He became [[Justice of the Peace|J.P.]] for Shropshire in 1869 and also [[Deputy Lieutenant]]. He was also a Captain of the 15th Shropshire Rifle Volunteers which he remained until 1888&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1n8BP7HsKCwC&amp;pg=PA177 William Retlaw Williams ''The Parliamentary History of the County of Worcester''  2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leighton owned brickworks at Sweeney, near Oswestry, which he leased to the Oswestry Coal &amp; Brick Co. Ltd. before 1880, then to the Sweeney Brick Co. Ltd., and after 1885 it was leased to Kay &amp; Hindle Ltd. as the Sweeney Brick &amp; Terra-cotta Works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/A2A/records.aspx?cat=166-mi5715&amp;cid=-1&amp;Gsm=2008-06-18#-1 Shropshire Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875, he purchased Llwyd's Mansion, an impressive timber framed building in the centre of Oswestry dating from 1604, which was then renovated and divided into shops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovershropshire.org.uk/html/search/verb/GetRecord/theme:20070306151620 Discovering Shropshire's History - Oswestry Town Trail]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874 Leighton stood unsuccessfully for [[Bewdley (UK Parliament constituency)|Bewdley]] but at a by-election in 1876 he was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[North Shropshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Shropshire]] and held the seat until it was reorganised in 1885. He was then elected for [[Oswestry (UK Parliament constituency)|Oswestry]] and held the seat until his death.

Leighton was an antiquary and active member of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/morris/works/1880/spab4.htm Annual Report of The SPAB - III By William Morris]&lt;/ref&gt;  which was founded by [[William Morris]] and [[Philip Webb]] in 1877, to oppose what they saw as the insensitive renovation of ancient buildings then occurring in [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[England]]. In 1888 he was Honorary Commissioner for [[South Australia]] at the Paris Exhibition 1888, and he was author of ''Records of Oswestry''. His ''Shropshire houses: past &amp; present; illustrated from drawings (1901)'' was complete and in the printer's hands at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/shropshirehouses00leiguoft ''Shropshire houses: past &amp; present; illustrated from drawings (1901)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

He died of [[pneumonia]] at his London home aged 63, having hastened to vote in the Commons over the Coal Duty Bill.&lt;ref name=schron1&gt;{{cite news|title=The late Mr. Stanley Leighton, M.P., F.S.A.|work=The Shrewsbury Chronicle|date=10 May 1901|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in St Oswald's parish churchyard at Oswestry.&lt;ref name=schron2&gt;{{cite news|title=The Late Mr. Stanley Leighton, The Funeral an Imposing Ceremony|work=The Shrewsbury Chronicle|date=10 May 1901|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leighton married Jessie Marie Williams-Wynn, daughter of Herbert Bertie Watkin Williams-Wynn on 28 August 1873. Their son [[Bertie Leighton|Bertie Edward Parker Leighton]] (1875–1952) was also MP for Oswestry (1929-1945) and inherited the Sweeney Estate.

[[Terrain]] or relief is an essential aspect of [[physical geography]], and as such its portrayal presents a central problem in [[cartography]], and more recently [[geographic information system|GIS]] and [[geovisualization]].

The most obvious way to depict relief is to imitate it at scale, as in molded or sculpted solid [[terrain model]]s and molded-plastic [[raised-relief map]]s. Because of the disparity between the horizontal and vertical scales of maps, raised relief is typically exaggerated.

On flat paper maps and computer screens, terrain can be depicted in a variety of ways, outlined below.

==Hill profiles==
[[File:Higuey.jpg|thumb|right|From a 1639 map of [[Hispaniola]] by [[Johannes Vingboons]], showing use of hill profiles]]
The most ancient form of relief depiction in cartography, '''hill profiles''' are simply illustrations of mountains and hills in profile, placed as appropriate on generally small-scale (broad area of coverage) maps. They are seldom used today except as part of an "antique" styling.

==Hachures==
[[File:Dufour-karte-bern 1-880x803.jpg|thumb|left|Dufour map of [[Bern]] (1907); this is a shaded hachure map.]]
{{Main|Hachure map}}
'''Hachures''' are also an older mode of representing relief. They are a form of shading, although different from the one used in shaded maps. They show the orientation of slope, and by their thickness and overall density they provide a general sense of steepness. Being non-numeric, they are less useful to a scientific survey than contours, but can successfully communicate quite specific shapes of terrain.

Hachure representation of relief was standardized by the Austrian topographer Johann Georg Lehmann in 1799.

==Contour lines==
{{Main|Contour line}}
'''Contour lines''' (or isohypses) are isolines showing equal elevation. This is the most common way of numerically showing elevation, and is familiar from [[topographic map]]s.

Most 18th and early 19th century national [[surveying|surveys]] did not record relief across the entire area of coverage, calculating only spot elevations at survey points. The [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) topographical survey maps included contour representation of relief, and so maps that show relief, especially with exact representation of elevation, came to be called topographic maps (or "topo" maps) in the [[United States]], and the usage has spread internationally.

[[File:Berninapass 1877 Siegfriedkarte.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Siegfried map of [[Bernina Pass]] (1877) with black, blue and brown contour lines at 30-meter intervals]]
On maps produced by [[Swisstopo]], the color of the contour lines is used to indicate the type of ground: black for bare rock and [[scree]], blue for ice and underwater contours, brown for earth-covered ground.&lt;ref&gt;Swisstopo, [http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/products/maps/leisure/hiking.parsysrelated1.96279.downloadList.81398.DownloadFile.tmp/symbolsen.pdf Conventional Signs].  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528053109/http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/products/maps/leisure/hiking.parsysrelated1.96279.downloadList.81398.DownloadFile.tmp/symbolsen.pdf |date=May 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tanaka (Relief) Contours==
The '''Tanaka (Relief) Contours''' technique is a method used to illuminate contour lines in order to help visualize terrain. Lines are highlighted or shaded depending on their relationship to a light source in the Northwest. If the object being illustrated would shadow a section of contour line, that contour would be represented with a black band. Otherwise, slopes facing the light source would be represented by white bands.

This method was developed by Professor Tanaka Kitiro in 1950, but had been experimented with as early as 1870, with little success due to technological limitations in printing. The resulting terrain at this point was a grayscale image&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals of Cartography. Misra R. P. and A. Ramesh. Concept Publishing Company. 1989. pp. 389-390&lt;/ref&gt;. Cartographer Berthold Horn later created software to digitally produce Tanaka Contours, and Patrick Kennelly, another cartographer, later found a way to add color to these maps, making them more realistic&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Kennelly &amp; A. Jon Kimerling (2001) Modifications of Tanaka's Illuminated Contour Method, Cartography and Geographic Information Science, 28:2, 111-123.&lt;/ref&gt;.

There are a number of issues with this method. Historically, maps using Tanaka Contours could only be produced on gray backgrounds, which technology was unprepared for. This method is also very time consuming. In addition, the method takes into account mainly aspect and elevation, whereas slope is un accounted for resulting in a very terraced appearance&lt;ref&gt; "RELIEF (TERRAIN) DEPICTION."

==Shaded relief==

[[File:WWtopo shading.jpg|thumb|left|Top: map of [[Lake Mead]] area&lt;br /&gt;Bottom: the same map with sun shading]]

'''Shaded relief''', or hill-shading, shows the shape of the terrain in a realistic fashion by showing how the three-dimensional surface would be illuminated from a point light source. The [[shadow|shadows]] normally follow the convention of [[top-left lighting]] in which the light source is placed near the upper-left corner of the map. If the map is [[map#Orientation of maps|oriented]] with north at the top, the result is that the light appears to come from the north-west. Although this is unrealistic lighting in the northern hemisphere, using a southern light source can cause [[multistable perception]] illusions, in which the topography appears inverted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Eduard Imhof| title = Cartographic relief presentation| date = 2007-06-01| publisher = Esri Pr| isbn = 978-1-58948-026-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaded relief was traditionally drawn with [[charcoal]], [[airbrush]] and other artist's media. The Swiss master [[Eduard Imhof]] is widely regarded as the master of manual hill-shading technique and theory. Imhof's contributions included a multi-color approach to shading, with purples in valleys and yellows on peaks, which is known as “illuminated shading.” Illuminating the sides of the terrain facing the light source with yellow colors provides greater realism, enhances the sense of the three-dimensional nature of the terrain, and make the map more aesthetically pleasing and artistic-looking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Bernhard |last1=Jenny |first2=Lorenz |last2=Hurni |title=Swiss-Style Colour Relief Shading Modulated by Elevation and by Exposure to Illumination |journal=The Cartographic Journal |volume=43 |number=3 |year=2006 |pages=198-207 |doi=10.1179/000870406X158164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaded relief is today almost exclusively computer-generated using [[digital elevation model]]s (DEM), with a resulting different look and feel. Much work has been done in digitally recreating the work of [[Eduard Imhof]], which has been fairly successful in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Patterson, "See the light: How to make illuminated shaded relief in Photoshop 6.0," http://www.shadedrelief.com/illumination/ (accessed 30 October 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The DEM may be converted to shaded relief using software such as [[Photoshop]], [[QGIS]], [[GRASS GIS]] or [[ArcMap]]'s Spatial Analyst extension. Computer-generated effects to increase the realism of shaded relief include resolution bumping, the blending of hill-shades at different scales, and sky model shading, which simulates ambient light on terrain from many directions.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, Tom., "Resolution bumping GTOPO30 in Photoshop: How to Make High-Mountains More Legible," http://www.shadedrelief.com/bumping/bumping.html (accessed 24 September 2012); Kennelly, J., &amp; Stewart, J. (2006). A Uniform Sky Illumination Model to Enhance Shading of Terrain and Urban Areas. Cartography and Geographic Information Science, 33(1), 21–36. https://doi.org/10.1559/152304006777323118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiographic illustration==
[[File:USPhysical-Web5.jpg|thumb|right|Web version of Patteron's ''Physical Map of the Coterminous United States''. Note the appearance of the [[Rocky Mountains]] in the full size version.]]
Pioneered by [[Erwin Raisz]], this technique uses generalized texture to imitate [[landform]] shapes over a large area. A combination of hill profile and shaded relief, this style of terrain representation is simultaneously idiosyncratic to its creator -- often hand-painted -- and found insightful in illustrating [[geomorphology|geomorphological]] patterns.

More recently, [[Tom Patterson (cartographer)|Tom Patterson]] created a computer-generated map of the United States using Erwin Raisz's work as a starting point,
the ''[http://www.shadedrelief.com/physical/index.html Physical Map of the Coterminous United States]''; he called the technique ''plan oblique relief''.

Portrayal of relief is especially important in [[mountain]]ous regions. The [http://www.mountaincartography.org Commission on Mountain Cartography] of the [[International Cartographic Association]] is the best-known forum for discussion of theory and techniques for mapping these regions.

== The Washington Roundtable for the Asia-Pacific Press (WRAPP) ==
The Washington Roundtable for the Asia-Pacific Press (WRAPP) is the largest organization of Asian media in the United States. It is currently affiliated with The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center. WRAPP's purpose is to provide Asian journalists greater access to "Inside the Beltway" policy-makers.

Since its inception in 1994, WRAPP has sponsored monthly news briefings tailored to the needs of Asian journalists. Roundtable sessions have included speakers such as Rep. Benjamin Gilman (R-NY), Chairman of the House International Relations Committee, Rep. Doug Bereuter (R-NB), Chairman of the House Asia-Pacific Subcommittee, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Dr. Kurt Campbell. Personalities such as Washington Post syndicated columnist David Broder have also been featured in the Roundtable's "on-the-record" briefings.

WRAPP membership includes nearly all Washington correspondents from Japan, Taiwan, Korea, China, and other countries in the region. Also among the Roundtable's 400 members are U.S.-based print and broadcast media - as well as international wire services and news agencies whose Washington bureaus cover Asia-Pacific diplomacy, trade, and security

'''''The Wrong Enemy: America in Afghanistan, 2001–2014''''' is a 2014 book by [[Carlotta Gall]]. In the book, she argues that the United States and its allies have been focused on stopping the terrorist activities of [[al-Qaeda]] and its [[Taliban]] supporters in Afghanistan, but that focus should have instead have been on antagonistic forces in Pakistan. Her reasoning is that the Taliban exists and [[Osama bin Laden]] was able to survive for so long (and [[Mullah Omar]] continues to be a fugitive) because Pakistan's corrupt government and the people at the [[Inter-Services Intelligence]], Pakistan's clandestine security service, provide aid to these terrorists.

Gall argues, using quotations from the area's leaders, that the US should have fought al-Qaeda and the Taliban inside Pakistan instead of going to war in Iraq in 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26748">The [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS) issues a number of forms for people to submit to them relating to immigrant and non-immigrant visa statuses.&lt;ref name=uscis-all-forms&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/forms|title = Forms|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These forms begin with the letter "I". None of the forms directly grants a [[United States visa]] (visas can only be issued by US consulates outside the United States), but approval of these forms may provide authorization for staying or extending one's stay in the United States as well as authorization for work. Some [[United States visa]]s require an associated approved USCIS immigration form to be submitted as part of the application.

Although the term ''immigration form'' is used on this page, and the forms begin with the letter "I", many of the forms pertain to non-immigrant visa classifications.

The USCIS also issues some administrative request forms (AR) for purposes such as address change as well as G forms for other administrative purposes.&lt;ref name=uscis-all-forms/&gt; The AR and G forms are generally filed in conjunction with a USCIS I form. The two most important G forms are the G-28 (notice of entry or appearance of attorney)&lt;ref name=g-28&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/g-28|title = G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the G-1145 (e-notification of application/petition acceptance).&lt;ref name=g-1145&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/g-1145|title = G-1145, E-Notification of Application/Petition Acceptance|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USCIS also handles forms related to naturalization and citizenship. These forms begin with the letter "N" and are not discussed on this page.&lt;ref name=uscis-all-forms/&gt;

There are two main forms that begin with the letter I and pertain to immigration status but are not managed by USCIS: [[Form I-20]] (issued by educational institutions to students on a [[F visa]] status)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/2013/01/what-is-the-form-i-20|title = What is the Form I-20?|date = January 28, 2014|accessdate = May 23, 2015|publisher = [[Department of Homeland Security]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Form I-94]] (issued by [[United States Customs and Border Protection]] when an alien enters the United States).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/|title = I-94|publisher = [[United States Customs and Border Protection]]|accessdate = May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Filing details==

===Fees===

All USCIS forms are free to download. The filing fees vary by form, from free to several hundred dollars.&lt;ref name=fees&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/fees|title = Filing Fees|accessdate = April 6, 2015|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filing fee for a form may not be the only fee that needs to be paid for the status being sought on the form. There may be additional fees associated with that status. For instance, [[Form I-129]] is used to apply for [[H-1B visa|H-1B status]] (among many other statuses).&lt;ref name=i-129&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/i-129|title = I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker|accessdate = April 6, 2015|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the forms, [[Form I-129]] and [[Form I-140]], are eligible for the [[Premium Processing Service]], which requires the filing of Form I-907. As of 2015, this service costs $1225.&lt;ref name=uscis-premium-processing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/forms/how-do-i-use-premium-processing-service|title = How Do I Use the Premium Processing Service?|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some applicants are eligible for a fee waiver. To apply for a fee waiver, the applicant must submit Form I-912, Request for a Fee Waiver, along with the application form.&lt;ref name=filing-tips/&gt;&lt;ref name=i-912&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/i-912|title = Form I-912, Request for a Fee Waiver|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/feewaiver|title = Fee Waiver Guidance|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paper filing===

All USCIS forms can be filed on paper. Payments must be included in the form of a check or money order along with the paper filing of the form.

The rules associated with where forms are to be mailed are complex: the location for mailing a form depends on the form name, the category of application, and the mailing address specified by the applicant (this may differ from the address the applicant sends the application from). The mailing address is either one of the lockbox addresses or one of the Service Center addresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/i-765-addresses|accessdate = April 6, 2015|title = Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lockboxes are in three US cities: [[Chicago]] ([[Illinois]]), [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] ([[Arizona]]), and [[Lewisville, Texas|Lewisville]] ([[Texas]]) (this is near [[Dallas, Texas]] and is often referred to as the Dallas lockbox). They are managed for the USCIS by a [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of Treasury]] designated financial agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/about-us/directorates-and-program-offices/lockbox-intake/office-intake-and-document-production|title = Office of Intake and Document Production|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lockbox cashes in on the included payment, sends an e-notification if the applicant filed Form G-1145 with the application, and forwards the rest of the application to the service center.&lt;ref name=filing-tips&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/forms-filing-tips|title = Tips for Filing Forms with USCIS|accessdate = April 6, 2015|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any response to a [[Request For Evidence]] (RFE) or [[Notice of Intent to Deny]] (NOID) must ''always'' be sent to the Service Center that sent the request, and ''never'' to a lockbox address, regardless of whether or not the original application was filed with a lockbox.&lt;ref name=filing-tips/&gt;

===Electronic filing===

Some of the USCIS forms may be filed electronically via e-Filing (for Forms I-131, I-140, I-765, I-821, and I-907) or the USCIS Electronic Immigration System (USCIS ELIS) (for Forms I-526, I-539, I-90, or the Immigrant Fee).&lt;ref name=e-filing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/e-filing|title = File My Application Online|accessdate = April 16, 2015|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=elis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/uscis-elis|title = USCIS Electronic Immigration System|accessdate = April 16, 2015|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic filing offers the following benefits:&lt;ref name=e-filing/&gt;

* It reduces the hassle and cost of filing a paper application (but see the caveat below).
* Fees may be paid by [[debit card]] or [[credit card]].
* The applicant receives an immediate confirmation of receipt of the application.

However, there are two major caveats:&lt;ref name=e-filing/&gt;

* Supporting documents must be sent in by mail within 7 days of online filing, to the address specified on the e-Filing Confirmation Receipt. USCIS does not begin processing the application until all supporting documents are received. If they are not received then USCIS may send the applicant a [[request for evidence]] (RFE).
* If the applicant is requesting a fee waiver (filing Form I-912) then the application cannot be submitted online and must be filed on paper.

To enhance privacy and security for applicants, USCIS uses the [[HTTPS]] protocol for e-filing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/forms/file-my-application-online-e-filing/additional-online-privacy-information-e-filing|title = Additional Online Privacy Information For E-filing|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms==

The two main kinds of forms are:

* Petition forms: Here, a petitioner files a form requesting a benefit (associated with an immigrant status or non-immigrant status) for a beneficiary. The beneficiary is usually distinct from the petitioner, though there are some self-petition categories. Petition forms generally carry the most uncertainty regarding approval, and some of them are subject to quotas.
* Application forms : These include application forms related to entry to the United States, leaving to the United States, and work authorization in the United States. The benefits being sought here are generally governed by clearer frameworks of rules, and carry less uncertainty than petition forms.

In addition, there are affidavits (such as Form I-134, Affidavit of Support)&lt;ref name=i-134&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/i-134|title =I-134, Affidavit of Support|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; verification forms (Form I-9, Employee Eligibility Verification Form),&lt;ref name=i-9&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/i-9|title = I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification|accessdate = May 23, 2015|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and request forms, such as Form I-907, Request for [[Premium Processing Service]].&lt;ref name=i-907&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/i-907|title = I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service|accessdate = May 23, 2015|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeal forms===

These are the forms that need to be filed to appeal a decision by a USCIS officer regarding another form. The appeal form must be filed by the party that filed the original form. In particular, in the case of a petition, the appeal must be filed by the petitioner and cannot be filed by the beneficiary (if distinct from the petitioner). Appeals are handled by the [[Executive Office for Immigration Review]] within the USCIS, which has two branches: the [[Board of Immigration Appeals]] and the [[Administrative Appeals Office]]. BIA's main role is for challenges to [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] decisions, but it is also used to appeal some USCIS forms.

{| class="sortable" border="1"

|}
Of the USCIS immigration forms, decisions on the two forms [[Form I-130]] (family-based immigration, the F and IR categories) and the widower subcategory for Form I-360 (special immigrants, the EB-4 category), must be appealed through the EOIR-29 (Notice of Appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals from a Decision of an Immigration Officer) to the [[Board of Immigration Appeals]]. Also, appeals for denials of Form N-400 (the naturalization petition) must be made using Form N-336. For Special Agricultural Worker (SAW) or legalization applications, the appeal must be filed on Form I-694, Notice of Appeal of Decision under Sections 245A or 210 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

For all other USCIS petitions where appeal is possible, the petitioner can appeal an adverse USCIS decision on the petition to the AAO using Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion.

As of December 2016, appeal to [[Administrative Appeals Office|AAO]] is possible for the following petition forms: [[Form I-129|I-129]] (nonimmigrant worker), [[Form I-140|I-140]] (immigrant worker), I-526 (immigrant investor), Form I-821, I-129F, I-601, I-212, I-360, I-600, I-600A, I-914, I-918, N-470. As of December 2016, there are no appeal rights for Form I-485 ([[Adjustment of Status]])

There is no standalone appeals process for Form I-765.

The form is usually applied for in conjunction with another form that grants the underlying authorization, and a denial of the other form can be appealed.

===Form I-797===
Form I-797 is a form used by the USCIS to issue approval of status or notice of receipt for applications. It is '''not a form that people can fill out'''.&lt;ref name=i-797-info&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/i-797-info|title = Form I-797: Types and Functions|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form-filling guidelines==

The USCIS website includes a number of tips for people filing USCIS forms, including suggestions to download the latest version from the website, use black ink, and start with a clean form in case of errors. All supporting documents must be included in the application, and documents not in English must include a certified English translation.&lt;ref name=tips&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/forms-filing-tips|title = Tips for Filing Forms with USCIS|accessdate = May 23, 2015|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law resource [[NOLO]] emphasizes the importance of filling in all fields, even if it's filled with "N/A", and being accurate and consistent. [[NOLO]] also places emphasis on getting one's name correct.

The '''Varvakeion Athena''' is a Roman-era statue of [[Athena Parthenos]] now part of the collection of the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]. It is generally considered to be the most faithful reproduction of the [[chryselephantine]] statue made by [[Phidias]] and his assistants, which once stood in the [[Parthenon]].&lt;ref name="NAM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nam.culture.gr/portal/page/portal/deam/virtual_exhibitions/EAMS/EAMG129|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916022900/http://nam.culture.gr/portal/page/portal/deam/virtual_exhibitions/EAMS/EAMG129|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-09-16|title=The Varvakeion Athena (129)|publisher=National Archaeological Museum|accessdate=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is dated to 200–250 AD.&lt;ref name="Kaltsas"/&gt;

The statue is {{convert|1.05|m|in|abbr=on}} tall, approximately one twelfth the estimated height of the original.&lt;ref name="Kaltsas"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s4glewvbsakC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=Varvakeion+Athena|title=Sculpture in the National Archaeological Museum, Athens|first=Nikolaos|last=Kaltsas|page=104|publisher=Kapon Editions|location=Athens|date=2002|accessdate=2016-06-07|isbn=9780892366866}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is carved of [[pentelic marble]] and bears traces of red and yellow paint. Athena is dressed in a [[peplos]] belted with a [[zone (vestment)|zone]] in the form of two snakes; over this she wears the [[aegis]], decorated with snakes and with the [[gorgoneion]] in the center.&lt;ref name="Kaltsas"/&gt; She wears an [[Attic helmet]] with the cheek guards upturned; it has three crests, the center sporting a [[sphinx]] and those on the sides a [[pegasus]].&lt;ref name="NAM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaltsas"/&gt; Her left hand rests on the rim of a shield which also bears the gorgoneion; the shield rests against the ''oikouros ophis'' (sacred snake) identified with [[Erichthonios]], the city's legendary founder.&lt;ref name="NAM"/&gt; The outstretched right hand is supported by a column and holds a winged figure of [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the head of which is missing.&lt;ref name="harrison"/&gt; This smaller image is likewise garbed in a peplos and is turned somewhat towards the main figure.&lt;ref name="harrison"/&gt; The whole assemblage rests on a rectangular base.&lt;ref name="Kaltsas"/&gt;

Certain differences between the original as described by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] may be noted. The original base was decorated with a frieze showing the birth of [[Pandora]], whereas the copy is plain; Pausanias also describes a spear which the copy lacks. The shield lacks the [[amazonomachy]] on the front which Pliny describes.&lt;ref name="Kaltsas"/&gt; The presence of the column is cited by many in the argument over whether the original required a similar support, though many reconstructions omit it (e.g. that in the [[Nashville Parthenon]]).&lt;ref name="harrison"/&gt;

The statue is named for the locale of its discovery in 1880,&lt;ref name="harrison"&gt;{{cite book|

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4135">'''Virtual Print Fee''' (VPF) is a subsidy paid by a [[film distributor]] towards the purchase of [[digital cinema]] projection equipment for use by a [[film exhibitor]] in the presentation of first release motion pictures.  The subsidy is paid in the form of a fee per booking of a movie, intended to match the savings that occurs by not shipping a film print.  The model is designed to help redistribute the savings realized by studios when using digital distribution instead of film print distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mkpe.com/digital_cinema/faqs/|title=Digital Cinema Business FAQs|first=MKPE Consulting|last=LLC|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first public demonstration of digital projection for cinema took place at ShoWest in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;[[Digital cinema#Technology demonstrations and system prototyping]]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was readily apparent that the technology was further ahead than the business model.  Early technology presentations attempted to claim that the technology would pay for itself through new revenues generated by new forms of content. But exhibitors knew their audience, and could see that digital projection was only a replacement technology, creating new financial liabilities, and not new revenue.  It wasn’t until the rollout of digital 3-D years later in 2005 that digital projection demonstrated that it could be used to generate additional revenue.

The economics were challenging.  Film projectors and platters cost in the neighborhood of US$30,000, while early digital projectors cost up to US$150,000.  Further, film projectors had a lifetime of 30 years with relatively small annual expenditures in maintenance and replacement parts.  On the other hand, exhibitors felt they would be lucky to get 10 years of service from a digital projector, after which there would have to be a refresh in capital expenditure.  Meanwhile, distributors would realize significant savings by eliminating the high cost of film prints with corresponding shipping costs, and instead distributing digital files either by satellite or hard drive. 

The Virtual Print Fee was designed to better balance savings and expenditures for both exhibitors and distributors.  It is intended to primarily assist in the replacement of film projectors, and not assist in the purchase of new projection equipment for new construction.  To give confidence to financial institutions that digital cinema technology was stable and worthy of investment, [[Digital Cinema Initiatives]] was created in 2002, resulting in the release of the first version of the DCI Digital Cinema System Specification in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcimovies.com|title=Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI) - DIGITAL CINEMA SYSTEM SPECIFICATION, VERSION 1.2|first=|last=companyv|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DCI Specification continues to be the core specification for digital cinema, establishing the baseline technology and system requirements for which studios will release digital movies.

The first set of VPF agreements executed with four major studios were announced by Christie/AIX in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.cinedigm.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=210434|title=NEW SONY PICTURES AGREEMENT WITH CHRISTIE/AIX SUPPORTS DIGITAL CINEMA TRANSITION (NASDAQ:CIDM)|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christie/AIX at that time was a subsidiary of Access Integrated Technology, now renamed [[Cinedigm]] Digital Cinema Corp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinedigm.com/|title=Home - Cinedigm|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The agreements were for the rollout of digital cinema technology to 4000 screens.  Since that time, numerous other Digital Cinema Deployment Agreements have been executed around the world, allowing exhibitors in nearly every territory to benefit from VPF subsidies in the conversion from film projection to digital projection.

[[File:Swiatowit3011.jpg|thumb|Zbruch Idol, an example of a [[bałwan]]]]
The '''Zbruch Idol''', '''Sviatovid''' (''Worldseeker'', {{lang-pl|Światowid ze Zbrucza}}, {{lang-uk|Збручанський ідол}}, {{lang-ru|Збручский идол}}) is a 9th-century [[sculpture]], more precisely an example of a [[bałwan]],&lt;ref name="Kozłowski"&gt;{{cite journal | author =Roman Kozłowski | year =1964 | title =Badania technologiczne posągu Światowida z Muzeum Archeologicznego w Krakowie | journal =Materiały archeologiczne | volume =V | issue = | pages =61–67 | id = | url = | format =  |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the few monuments of pre-Christian [[Slavic mythology|Slavic beliefs]]. The pillar was commonly incorrectly associated with the Slavic deity [[Svetovid]], although current opinions on the exact meaning of all the bas-reliefs and their symbols differ. It is thought that the three tiers of [[bas-relief]] represent the three levels of the world, from the bottom underworld, to the middle mortal world and the uppermost, largest, world of heavenly gods.

[[File:PosagZeZbrucza.jpg|thumb|220px|Presentation of the reliefs adorning each side of the [[bałwan]] of Zbrucz carving. Ryc. Ratomir Wilkowski, broszura programowa Rodzimego Kościoła Polskiego z 2013 r.]]It is suggested that the sculpture was disposed of or was buried in a pit some time after the [[baptism of Kievan Rus]], and [[Christianization of Poland|acceptance of Christianity in Poland in 966]], like various buried idols in [[Kiev]] and [[Novgorod]]. In the 19th century, when the [[Zbruch River]] (a left tributary of the [[Dniester]]) changed its bed, the area where the pillar was buried became submerged.&lt;ref name="Muzeum"&gt;{{cite web | author=Marta Zaitz | title=Światowid - kamienny posąg z IX wieku | publisher=Archaeological Museum of Kraków  | year=2005 | work=Museum's Website | url=http://www.ma.krakow.pl/pradzieje/swiatowid | accessdate=2007-01-24 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered during a drought near the village of [[Lychkivtsi]], just north of [[Husiatyn]], in 1848. The statue is now on display in the [[Archaeological Museum of Kraków]] in [[Poland]], with exact copies located in a number of museums, including the [[State Historical Museum]] in [[Moscow]].

==Description==
The Zbruch Idol is a four-sided pillar of grey [[limestone]], {{convert|2.67|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height, and has three tiers of reliefs engraved upon each of the four sides. The lower tier is {{convert|67|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}; the middle tier is {{convert|40|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}; and the top tier is {{convert|167|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}. It is possible that during the 1848 excavation of the monument its lower layer was broken off and lost.&lt;ref name="Muzeum"/&gt; The reliefs are in rather poor condition, though some traces of original [[polychrome]] were found in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Kozłowski"/&gt; The reliefs depict the following characters:

*Three sides of the lowest tier show a kneeling, bearded entity who appears to support the upper tier on his hands; the fourth side is blank.
*The middle tier shows a smaller entity with extended arms on all four sides.
*The four sides of the uppermost tier have the largest figures of the idol, with four faces united beneath a tall rounded hat. Each of the sides has a distinct attribute: a ring or a bracelet; a drinking horn, or horn of plenty,  and a tiny "child" figure; a sword and a horse; and an eroded solar symbol.

==Discovery and controversy==
The statue was discovered in August 1848 in the village of Lychkivtsi (Liczkowce) in [[Podolia]] (then in the [[Austrian Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kuropatnicki |first1=Ewaryst Andrzej|title=Geografia albo dokładne opisanie Królestw Galicyi i Londomeryi w roku 1786 |date=1858 |publisher=Drukarnia Zakładu Narodowego im. Ossolińskich |page=100 |url=http://rcin.org.pl/Content/34790/WA51_22605_PANII1606-r1858_Galicya-i-Lodomerya.pdf |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; now in [[Ukraine]]), during a drought that made the bottom of the river visible. The owner of the village, [[Konstanty Zaborowski]], brother of the late poet, [[Tymon Zaborowski|Tymon]], donated it to  Polish Count [[Mieczysław Potocki]], who in 1850 reported it to the Kraków Scientific Society.&lt;ref name="Muzeum"/&gt; It was also Potocki who first wondered that the statue might represent [[Swiatowid]].&lt;ref name="Muzeum"/&gt; Initially kept in the Library of the [[Jagiellonian University]], in 1858 it was moved to the temporary exhibition of antiquities in the [[Lubomirski]] family palace and then to the headquarters of the Kraków Scientific Society. However, it was not until 1950 that it was placed on permanent exhibition. Since 1968 it has been kept in the Kraków Archaeological Museum.&lt;ref name="Muzeum"/&gt;

Ever since the discovery of the monument there has been debate about what exactly the idol represents.&lt;ref name="Kozłowski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kwapiński"&gt;{{cite book | author =various authors |author2=Janusz Kotlarczyk  | title =Wierzenia przedchrześcijańskie na ziemiach polskich (Pre-Christian Beliefs in Polish lands) | year =1993 | editor =Marian Kwapiński, Henryk Paner | pages =56–64 | chapter =W poszukiwaniu genezy wielotwarzowych wyobrażeń Światowida, Świętowita, Rujewita i innych | chapterurl = | publisher = | location =Gdańsk | id = | url = | format = | accessdate = |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Szafrański"&gt;{{cite book | author =Włodzimierz Szafrański | title =Prahistoria religii na ziemiach polskich (Pre-history of Religion on Polish Lands) | year =1987 | editor =[[Polish Academy of Sciences]] | pages =356–357, 417–418 | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =[[Ossolineum]] | location =Wrocław | isbn =978-83-04-02624-7 | url = | format = | accessdate = |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the discovery, [[Joachim Lelewel]] theorized the top tier represented two bearded males and two females, being the four seasons: female with the ring, Spring; male with the horn, Summer; female with the horse and sword, Autumn; and the male without any attributes, Winter{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

[[Andrei Famintsyn|Andrei Sergeevich Famintsyn]] in his 1884 work "Ancient Slav Deities"&lt;ref name="Famintsyn"&gt;{{cite book | author =Andrei Famintsyn | title =Божества древних славян (Ancient Slav Deities) | year =1884 | editor = | pages = | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =Aleteya | location =Sankt-Peterburg | oclc=28657234 &lt;!-- This is the WorldCat # for the original 1884 edition, and it's microfilm versions --&gt; | url = | format = | accessdate = |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued against Lelewel's theory, and instead claimed that the Zbruch pillar is a representation of a single deity and that all four sides of each tier represented one entity. As was first suggested by Count Potocki, he identified the deity as a representation of the Slavic four-headed god Swiatowid, until then primarily associated with the island of [[Rügen]], but now understood to be pan-Slavic. The reasoning was that historical sources mentioned the deity of Rügen as being kept in a wooden temple together with a sacred sword, a drinking horn and a horse. Famintsyn was also the first to recognize the three-tiered structure as being related to the three levels of the world, linking it to the Slavic deity [[Triglav (mythology)|Triglav]].

The identification of the deity with Swiatowid was also supported by [[Gabriel Leńczyk]], who was also the first to identify the eroded solar symbol on the side, previously believed to be without attributes.&lt;ref name="Leńczyk"&gt;{{cite journal | author =Gabriel Leńczyk | year =1964 | title =Światowid zbruczański (Swiatowit of the Zbrucz river) | journal =Materiały Archeologiczne | volume = | issue = | pages = | id = | url = | format = | accessdate = |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory was presented by [[Henryk Łowmiański]], who in his 1979 monograph on the religion of Slavs&lt;ref name="Łowmiański"&gt;{{cite book | author =Henryk Łowmiański | title =Religia Słowian i jej upadek (The Religion of Slavs and its Fall) | year =1979 | editor =[[Adam Mickiewicz University]] | pages = | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =[[Państwowe Wydawnictwa Naukowe PWN]] | location =Warsaw | isbn =978-83-01-00033-2 | url = | format = | accessdate = |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the idol was altogether non-Slavic, as it was made of stone, and not of wood, which was the basic construction material of the Slavs, but the legends of Swiatowid exist among all Slavic cultures nonetheless.

[[Boris Rybakov]] in his 1987 work ''Paganism of Ancient Rus'' (Russian tribes)&lt;ref name="Rybakov"&gt;{{cite book |author=Boris Rybakov |title=Язычество Древней Руси |trans-title=Paganism of Ancient Rus |year=1987 |chapter=Святилища, идолы и игрища |chapterurl=http://historic.ru/books/item/f00/s00/z0000030/st003.shtml |publisher=Nauka |location=Moscow |url=http://historic.ru/books/item/f00/s00/z0000030/ |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that four sides of the top tier represent four different Slavic gods, two female and two male, with their corresponding middle-tier entities always of the opposite gender. In Rybakov's hypothesis, the male deity with the horse and sword is the Lightning god [[Perun]], the female with the horn of plenty is [[Mokosh]], the female with the ring is [[Lada and Lado|Lada]], and the male deity with the solar symbol, above the empty underworld, is [[Dažbog]], (the God of sunlight for whom the sun was not an object but an attribute, thus the symbol's position on his clothing rather than in his hand). Further, Rybakov suggests the underworld deity as [[Veles (god)|Veles]].

Rybakov also claimed the side with the female figure holding a horn as the front of the idol, based on the bottom-tier figure, which is shown with legs as if seen from head-on, the two adjoining sides showing the legs from the side, and the fourth side left blank. Finally, Rybakov believes that the idol's overall phallic shape is meant to unite all of the smaller figures as a single overarching all seeing larger deity, [[Rod (god)|Rod]].

According to Aleksey Komar and Natalia Khamaiko (2011), the sculpture is a fake produced by [[Tymon Zaborowski]], whose estate was located near the place where the statue was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kalik |first1=Judith |last2=Uchitel |first2=Alexander |title=Slavic Gods and Heroes |date=2018 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781138493193}}&lt;/ref&gt;
