== History ==
In the 1990s, an interreligious society was established in the canton of Zürich to support the foundation of a centre for spiritual and cultural care of [[Tamil people]] in Switzerland, as well as to preserve and maintain the [[Tamil culture]] of the approximatively 35,000 (around 20,000 in the canton of Zürich) Tamil people of [[Sri Lanka]]n origin living in Switzerland. So, the [[Sri Sivasubramaniar Temple]] in Adliswil and the Arulmiku Sivan Temple in Glattbrugg were founded in 1994 as a [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|non-profit foundation]].&lt;ref name="religionench"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionenschweiz.ch/hinduismus.html |title=Hinduismus in der Schweiz |publisher=Religionen in der Schweiz |author= |language=German |date= |accessdate=2015-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215200913/http://religionenschweiz.ch/hinduismus.html |archivedate=2015-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some 5,000 Indian Hindus in Switzerland founded their own cultural associations, but not a temple, the Tamil Hindus opened 19 houses of worship since the 1990s.

== Location ==
The temple was established in a pre-existing warehouse at the industry quarter between Glattbrugg and [[Seebach (Zürich)]]. The Temple is located at Industriestrasse 34, 8152 Glattbrugg.&lt;ref name="kontakt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sivankovil.ch/?pn=contact_de|title=Kontakt|publisher=sivankovil.ch|author=|language=German, Tamil|date=|accessdate=2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Atlantic Initiative''' is a non-partisan, non-profit, and independent organization founded in [[Berlin]] in 2004. The organization's goal is to promote German-American friendship as well as research in the field of international relations.&lt;ref&gt;§ 2 of Atlantic Initiative's Articles of Association&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Atlantic Initiative runs the online think tank [[Atlantic Community]], the blog ''Deutschlands Agenda'' und publishes the monthly ''Global Must Reads''.

==Organization==

Johannes Bohnen und Jan Kallmorgen are the founding directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bohnen-kallmorgen.com/root/index.php?page_id=9 Johannes Bohnen, Porträt]&lt;/ref&gt; Other founding members include: [[Alexander Graf Lambsdorff]] (MdEP, FDP), Björn Sackniess, Christoph Schwegmann (BMVg), Andrea Stürmer (Zurich Financial Services), Rüdiger C. Sura ([[Deutsche Bank]]), Jan Techau (Carnegie Europe), Philip Christian Wachs (Haus Rissen), Magnus Prinz zu Wied (Huntsman Materials &amp; Effects), Tobias Wolny ([[BP]]) and Lars Zimmermann (Stiftung Neue Verantwortung).

In addition, a 32-person board of advisors from business, politics, and academics supports the Atlantic Initiative. In the past, the organization financed its work with money from its own members, government grants, and commissioned work for third parties.&lt;ref name="faz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/open-think-tank-ein-facebook-fuer-aussenpolitik-1773696.html |author=Wulf Schmiese |title=Ein "Facebook" für Außenpolitik? |publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung |date=2009-02-26 |access-date=2012-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online Think Tank Atlantic Community==

{{Main|Atlantic Community}}

Atlantic-community.org is an online foreign policy think tank with over 7,000 members that was launched in 2007 as a project of the Atlantic Initiative. Atlantic Community empowers students and young professionals and promotes their policy recommendations for transatlantic cooperation. The members of Atlantic Community share and discuss their ideas by posting op-eds and research papers on the website, www.atlantic-community.org. The submissions are then assessed and edited by the editorial staff before being published on the website. Readers discuss and debate over the ideas and suggestions presented in the articles by posting comments. The editorial staff then condenses the debates into Atlantic Memos. These memos are executive summaries that harness the collective intelligence of the community and present the most outstanding solutions and policy recommendations. Atlantic Memos are sent to policy makers in over 27 countries across the Atlantic for their consideration. Atlantic-community.org also features numerous events, theme weeks, and special features such as Policy Workshop Competitions and Q&amp;As with senior policy makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlantic-community.org/index/about/us |title=About Us |publisher=Atlantic-community.org |access-date=2012-09-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031235634/http://www.atlantic-community.org/index/about/us# |archive-date=2012-10-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global Must Reads==

''Global Must Reads'' has been published monthly by the Atlantische Initiative since August 2005. It is a premium selection of studies and analyses from over 50 American and European sources (Think Tanks, magazines, and journals), which are concisely summarized.  With a readership of over 22,000, ''Global Must Reads'', according to the Atlantic Initiative, is the "'farthest-reaching foreign policy publication in the German language'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlantische-initiative.org/gmr/ Global Must Reads]&lt;/ref&gt; The Atlantic Initiative's ''Global Must Reads'' are not limited to German and American relationships, but cover a vast array of subjects, including digital security and women taking on leadership positions.

==Deutschlands Agenda==

The organization kick-started a new blog project, ''Deutschlands Agenda'', in November 2011. The project was created on the reworked homepage of the Atlantic Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlantische-initiative.org/deutschlandsagenda/ Deutschlands Agenda]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gfw-ev.de/gfw-bundesweit/neuigkeiten/atlantische-initiative.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130206184851/http://www.gfw-ev.de/gfw-bundesweit/neuigkeiten/atlantische-initiative.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-06 |author=Pether E. Uhde |title=Im Blickpunkt: Atlantische Initiative |publisher=Gesellschaft für Wehr- und Sicherheitspolitik e.V. |access-date=2012-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the aim of providing "'foreign policy for all'",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bild.de/politik/2010/soldat/was-verbirgt-sich-dahinter-12764956.bild.html |title=Feldpost für unsere Soldaten |publisher=Bild.de |date=2010-07-22 |access-date=2012-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
the organization aspires to offer a forum for debate on German foreign policy.  The project was sponsored by the German Press Office and the Haniel Foundation until April 2012. Since May 2012, the [[Federal Foreign Office (Germany)]], BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt, the German Armed Forces Association, [[BP]] and Allianz Cultural Foundation have all sponsored the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlantische-initiative.org/forderer-spenden/ Atlantische Initiative: Förderer]&lt;/ref&gt;

The blog ''Deutschlands Agenda'' was officially launched on August 8 and has published numerous articles since then, including one from the [[Federal Foreign Office (Germany)]]  [[Guido Westerwelle]], and another from [[Thomas de Maizière]], the [[Federal Ministry of Defense (Germany)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atlantische-initiative.org/2012/05/29/weniger-vergangenheit-mehr-verantwortung/ |author=[[Thomas de Maizière]] |title=Mehr Vergangenheit, weniger Verantwortung |date=2012-05-29 |access-date=2012-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://augengeradeaus.net/2012/05/de-maiziere-wirbt-erneut-fur-akzeptanz-zusatzlicher-verpflichtungen/ |author=[[Thomas Wiegold]] |title=De Maizière wirbt (erneut) für Akzeptanz "zusätzlicher Verpflichtungen" |date=2012-05-29 |access-date=2012-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Deutschlands Agenda'' regularly features themes reflecting topical issues. While the vigorous debates on [[Afghanistan]] continued to persist until the theme reached its end in January 2012, the next theme entitled "[[Germany]] in the [[European Union|EU]]" took place in the following month.  The [[G8]] &amp; [[G20]], BRIC-States, new global [http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/cae/servlet/contentblob/608384/publicationFile/164370/Gestaltungsmaechtekonzept.pdf;jsessionid=218F2E1B9AF1CA84DD8E5127E02FF43C policy shapers] and [[NATO]]'s upcoming summit are among the other themes have been scheduled for the year 2012.  So as to ensure more in-depth and thorough content, each theme will feature articles from experts, think tanks, bloggers, politicians and journalists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22113">'''Climate change and poverty''' link a process and a condition that are interrelated. While [[climate change]] and [[global warming]] affect the [[natural environment]], especially [[agriculture]], it also [[Effects of global warming on human health|affects humans]]. Climate change globally impacts [[poverty]], particularly in low-income communities. 

== Overview ==
[[File:Polar Bears Fight Climate Poverty 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Demonstration against climate poverty (2007)]]
Climate change's adverse effects mostly impact poor and low-income communities around the world. Those in poverty have a higher chance of experiencing the ill-effects climate change due to increased exposure and vulnerability.&lt;ref name=Rayner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rayner|first=S. and E.L. Malone|title=Climate Change, Poverty, and Intragernerational Equity: The National Leve|journal=International Journal of Global Environment Issues|year=2001|volume=I|series=1|issue=2|pages=175–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vulnerability]] represents the degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, adverse effects of [[climate change]] including [[climate variability]] and extremes. Also, a lack of capacity available for coping with environmental change is experienced in lower-income communities.&lt;ref name=Smit&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smit|first=B, I. Burton, R.J.T. Klein, and R. Street|title=The Science of Adaption: A framework for Assessment|journal=Mitigation and Adaption Stretegies for Global Change|year=1999|volume=4|pages=199–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United Nations Development Programme]], [[developing countries]] suffer 99% of the casualties attributable to climate change.&lt;ref name="Human Development Report"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Human Development Report 2007/2008: The 21st Century Climate Challenge.|journal=United Nations Development Programme|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr_20072008_en_complete.pdf|accessdate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Climate change raises some [[climate ethics]] issues, as the least 50 developed countries of the world account for an imbalanced 1% contribution to the worldwide emissions of greenhouse gasses which are theorized to be attributable to global warming.&lt;ref name="Human Development Report" /&gt; The issue of [[distributive justice]] questions how to fairly share the benefits and burdens of climate change policy options. Many of the policy tools often employed to solve environmental problems, such as [[cost-benefit analysis]], usually do not adequately deal with these issues because they often ignore questions of just distribution and the effects on [[human rights]].

== Poverty impacts ==
The [[cycle of poverty]] exacerbates the potential negative impacts of climate change. This phenomenon is defined when poor families become trapped in poverty for at least three generations and when they have limited or no access to resources and are disadvantaged in means of breaking the cycle.&lt;ref name=Marger&gt;{{cite book|last=Marger|title=Social Inequality: Patterns and Processes, 4th edition|year=2008|publisher=McGraw Hill publishing|isbn=0-07-352815-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in rich countries, coping with climate change has largely been a matter of adjusting thermostats, dealing with longer, hotter summers, and observing seasonal shifts; for those in poverty, weather-related disasters, a bad harvest, or even a family member falling ill can provide crippling economic shocks.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Development Programme. 2006. "Human Development Report: Beyond Scarcity: Power, Poverty, and the Global Water Crisis." New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006. (pp. 25–199).&lt;/ref&gt; Besides these economic shocks, the widespread famine, drought, and potential humanistic shocks could affect the entire nation. High levels of poverty and low levels of [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] limit capacity of poor households to manage climate risks. With limited access to formal insurance, low incomes and meagre assets, poor households have to deal with climate-related shocks under highly constrained conditions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;IPCC. 2001. Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, Contribution of Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to the Third Assessment Report of the IPCC. Online at www.ipcc.ch (Accessed October 23, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reversing development ==
Climate change is globally encompassing and can reverse development in some areas in the following ways.

=== Agricultural production and food security ===
There has been considerable research comparing the interrelated processes of [[climate change and agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. 2007. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (Accessed on November 2, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change will affect rainfall, temperature, and water availability for agriculture in vulnerable areas.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Climate change could affect agriculture in several ways including productivity, agricultural practices, environmental effects, and distribution of rural space.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Schneider, S.H. et al. (2007). "Assessing key vulnerabilities and the risk from climate change. In: Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability. Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [M.L. Parry et al. (eds.)"]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K., and New York, N.Y., U.S.A.. pp. 779–810. Retrieved 2009-05-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional number affected by malnutrition could rise to 600 million by 2080. Climate change could worsen the prevalence of hunger through direct negative effects on production and indirect impacts on purchasing powers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

=== Water insecurity ===
Of the 3 billion growth in population projected worldwide by the mid-21st century, the majority will be born in countries already experiencing [[water shortages]].&lt;ref name="UNDP 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Human Development Report: Beyond Scarcity: Power, Poverty, and the Global Water Crisis|journal=United Nations Development Programme|year=2006|pages=25–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the overall climate of the earth warms, changes in the nature of global rainfall, evaporation, snow, and runoff flows will be affected.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Kathleen. 1997. Climate Variability, Climate Change and Western Water. Report to the Western Water Policy Review Advisory Commission, NTIS, Springfield, VA. http://www.isse.ucar.edu/water_climate/impacts.html (Accessed on November, 2, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Safe water sources are essential for survival within a community. Manifestations of the projected [[water crisis]] include inadequate access to safe drinking water for about 884 million people as well as inadequate access to water for sanitation and water disposal for 2.5 billion people.&lt;ref&gt;Updated Numbers: WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation Updated Report. 2008. http://www.unicef.org/media/media_44093.html, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rising sea levels and exposure to climate disasters ===
Sea levels could rise rapidly with accelerated ice sheet disintegration. Global temperature increases of 3–4 degrees C could result in 330 million people being permanently or temporarily displaced through flooding &lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Warming seas will also fuel more intense tropical storms.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

=== Ecosystems and biodiversity ===
Climate change is already transforming [[Ecological systems]]. Around one-half of the world’s coral reef systems have suffered bleaching as a result of warming seas. In addition, the direct human pressures that might be experienced include [[overfishing]] which could lead to [[resource depletion]], nutrient and chemical pollution and poor land use practices such as [[deforestation]] and [[dredging]]. Also, climate change may increase the amount of [[arable land]] in high-latitude regions by reduction of the amount of frozen lands. A 2005 study reports that temperature in Siberia has increased three degree Celsius in average since 1960, which is reportedly more than in other areas of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Sample, Ian. "Warming hits ‘tipping point’" The Guardian. August 11, 2005. (Accessed on November 12, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human health ===
A direct effect is increase in temperature-related illnesses and deaths related to prolonged heat waves and humidity. Climate change could also change the geographic range of vector-borne, specifically [[mosquito-borne disease]] such as [[malaria]] [[dengue fever]] exposing new populations to the disease.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Because a changing climate affects the essential ingredients of maintaining good health: clean air and water, sufficient food and adequate shelter, the effects could be widespread and pervasive. The report of the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health points out that disadvantaged communities are likely to shoulder a disproportionate share of the burden of climate change because of their increased exposure and vulnerability to health threats.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. 2004. The Global Burden Disease: 2004 Update. http://who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/2004_report_update/en/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Over 90 percent of malaria and diarrhea deaths are borne by children aged 5 years or younger, mostly in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Human Development Report" /&gt;  Other severely affected population groups include women, the elderly and people living in small island developing states and other coastal regions, mega-cities or mountainous areas.&lt;ref name="Human Development Report" /&gt;

== Security impacts ==
The concept of [[Human security]] and the effects that climate change may have on it will become increasingly important as the changes become more apparent.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;Liotta, Peter. "Climate Change and Human Security: The Use of Scenarios" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association, Town &amp; Country Resort and Convention Center, San Diego, California, USA, Mar 22, 2006. 2009-05-25 &lt;/ref&gt; Some effects are already evident and will become very clear in the human and climatic short run (2007–2020). They will increase and others will manifest themselves in the medium term (2021–2050); whilst in the long run (2051–2100), they will all be active and interacting strongly with other major trends.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; There is the potential for the end of the petroleum economy for many producing and consuming nations, possible financial and economic crisis, a larger population of humans, and a much more urbanized humanity – far in excess of the 50% now living in small to very large cities.&lt;ref name="Simon 2007"&gt;Simon, David. (2007), "Cities and Global Environmental Change: Exploring the Links," The Geographical Journal 173, 1 (March): 75–79 &amp; see chapters 3 &amp; 4 of Sir Nicholas Stern et al. (2007) Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change. London: UK, Department of the Treasury http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/stern_review_report.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; All these processes will be accompanied by redistribution of population nationally and internationally.&lt;ref name="Simon 2007"/&gt; Such redistributions typically have significant gender dimensions; for example, extreme event impacts can lead to male out migration in search of work, culminating in an increase in women-headed households – a group often considered particularly vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;Delaney and Elizabeth Shrader (2000) "Gender and Post-Disaster Reconstruction: The Case of Hurricane Mitch in Honduras and Nicaragua", LCSPG/LAC Gender Team, The World Bank, Decision Review Draft, page 24 http://www.gdnonline.org/resources/reviewdraft.doc&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the effects of climate change on impoverished women and children is crucial in that women and children in particular, have unequal [[Capability approach|human capabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF. 2007. Climate Change and Children. New York: United Nations Children’s Fund. p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infrastructure impacts ==
The potential effects of climate change and the security of [[infrastructure]] will have the most direct effect on the poverty cycle. Areas of infrastructure effects will include water systems, housing and settlements, transport networks, utilities, and industry.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Jabeen, Huraera and Fuad H. Mallick. "Urban Poverty, climate change and built environment." The Daily Star. January 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Infrastructure designers can contribute in three areas for improving living environment for the poor, in building design, in settlement planning and design as well as in urban planning.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; The National Research Council has identified five climate changes of particular importance to infrastructure and factors that should be taken into consideration when designing future structures. These factors include: increases in very hot days and heat waves, increases in Arctic temperatures, rising sea levels, increases in intense precipitation events, and increases in hurricane intensity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;O’Leary, Maureen. March 21, 2008. Climate Change on Infrastructure. http://scitizen.com/climate-change/climate-change-on-infrastructure_a-13-1788.html (Accessed on November 2, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, transportation decision makers continually make short- and long-term investment decisions that affect how infrastructure will respond to climate change.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Climate change mitigation is the action to decrease the intensity of [[radiative forcing]] in order to reduce the potential effects of global warming. Most often, mitigation efforts involve reductions in the [[concentrations]] of [[greenhouse gases]], either by reducing their [[:wikt:source|source]] or by increasing their [[sinks]].&lt;ref&gt;Molina, M.; Zaelke, D.; Sarmac, K. M.; Andersen, S. O.; Ramanathane, V.; Kaniaruf, D. (2009). "Tipping Elements in Earth Systems Special Feature: Reducing abrupt climate change risk using the Montreal Protocol and other regulatory actions to complement cuts in CO2 emissions". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 106 (49): 20616. doi:10.1073/pnas.0902568106. {{PMID|19822751}}. PMC 2791591. http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/10/19/0902568106.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adaptation efforts ===
[[Adaptation to global warming]] involves actions to tolerate the effects of global warming. Collaborative research from the [[Institute of Development Studies]] draws links between adaptation and poverty to help develop an agenda for pro-poor adaptation that can inform climate-resilient poverty reduction. Adaptation to climate change will be "ineffective and inequitable if it fails to learn and build upon an understanding of the multidimensional and differentiated nature of poverty and vulnerability".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;IDS Bulletin. Poverty in a Changing Climate IDS Bulletin 39(4):2, September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Poorer countries tend to be more seriously affected by climate change, yet have reduced assets and capacities with which to adapt.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; This has led to more activities to integrate adaptation within development and poverty reduction programs. The rise of adaptation as a development issue has been influenced by concerns around minimizing threats to progress on poverty reduction, notably the [[Millennium Development Goals]], and by the injustice of impacts that are felt hardest by those who have done least to contribute to the problem, framing adaptation as an equity and [[human rights]] issue.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

== Proposed policy challenges ==
Most difficult policy challenge is related to [[distribution (economics)|distribution]]. While this is a potential catastrophic risk for the entire globe, the short and medium-term distribution of the costs and benefits will be far from uniform.&lt;ref name="Human Development Report" /&gt;  Distribution challenge is made particularly difficult because those who have largely caused the problem – richer nations – are not going to be those who suffer the most in the short term. It is the poorest who did not and still are not contributing significantly to green house gas emissions that are the most vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;La Trobe, S. 2002.

the National Violence Against Women Survey (1998), which, according to Straus, used a "feminist version" of the CTS in order to minimize data on female perpetration of [[intimate partner violence]] (IPV),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.breakingthescience.org/StrausSaysTjadenThoennesBiased.php | title=Straus Says National Violence Against Women Survey is Biased | last=Rosenthal | first=Mark B. | date=April 4, 2005 | publisher= Breaking the Science | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neglect | volume=33 | issue=2 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | pages=84–93}} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major international survey to use the CTS was the 2006 International Dating Violence Study, which investigated IPV amongst 13,601 college students across thirty-two different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Straus | first=Murray A. | date=March 2008 | title=Dominance and symmetry in partner violence by male and female university students in 32 nations | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/ID41-PR41-Dominance-symmetry-In-Press-07.pdf | journal=Children and Youth Services Review | volume=30 | issue=3 | pages=252–275 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2007.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 article in the ''Journal of Interpersonal Violence'', Jennifer Langhinrichsen-Rohling listed the CTS amongst the most important advances in the field of IPV research, stating it "was revolutionary because it allowed researchers to [[Quantitative research|quantitatively]] study events that had often been ignored culturally and typically took place in private."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Langhinrichsen-Rohling | first1=Jennifer | date=January 2005 | title=Top 10 Greatest "Hits": Important Findings and Future Directions for Intimate Partner Violence Research | url=http://rzukausk.home.mruni.eu/wp-content/uploads/Intimate-Partner-Violence-Research.pdf | journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume=20 | issue=1 | page=108 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | doi=10.1177/0886260504268602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the CTS is one of the most widely criticized domestic violence measurement instruments due to its exclusion of context variables and motivational factors in understanding acts of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dobash | first1=Russel P. | last2=Dobash | first2=R.

==Structure==
The scales are based on the premise that [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] is an inevitable aspect of all human association, but that the use of [[coercion]] (including force and violence) as a conflict-resolution tactic is harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Straus | first=Murray A. | date=February 1979 | title=Measuring intra family conflict and violence: The Conflict Tactics (CT) Scales | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CTS41%20(CTS2x-Abridged).pdf | journal=Journal of Marriage and the Family | volume=41 | issue=1 | page=75 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | doi=10.2307/351733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Straus190&gt;{{cite book | last1=Straus | first1=Murray A. | editor1-first=Nicky Ali | editor1-last=Jackson | title=Encyclopedia of Domestic Violence | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=2007 | page=190 | chapter=Conflict Tactics Scales | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CTS44G.pdf | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CTS focuses on "conflict tactics" – the method used to advance one's own interest within a conflict – as a behavior, and measures the conflict tactic behaviors of both the respondent and their partner/primary caregiver. However, the CTS "deliberately excludes attitudes, emotions, and cognitive appraisal of the behaviors" measured. This is because many victims of IPV do not see themselves as suffering abuse, and as such, their cognitive appraisal of their situation can affect the measurements of the CTS. Straus explains that the "discrepancy between the behavior and the cognitive appraisal of the behavior is important for understanding family violence and for designing programs of prevention and treatment. However, it is possible to identify the discrepancy only if there is an instrument such as the CTS which obtains the behavioral data."&lt;ref name=Straus191&gt;{{cite book | last1=Straus | first1=Murray A. | editor1-first=Nicky Ali | editor1-last=Jackson | title=Encyclopedia of Domestic Violence | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=2007 | page=191 | chapter=Conflict Tactics Scales | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CTS44G.pdf | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CTS-based study would ideally include data from respondents and their partners/primary caregivers in order to investigate the degree of symmetry or asymmetry between their responses. The CTS can be administered through an in-person interview, telephone interview, self-administered questionnaire, and/or computer-administered questionnaire.

===Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2)===
The revised CTS2 measures a total of 39 behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.musc.edu/vawprevention/research/screening.shtml | title=Screening Measures for Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, and Physical Assault | last=Acierno | first=Ron | publisher=National Violence Against Women Prevention Research Center, [[Medical University of South Carolina]] | date= 2000 | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these behaviors, or "items", is divided into five categories: "Negotiation", "Psychological Aggression", "Physical Assault", "Sexual Coercion" and "Injury." Each of the five categories is then further subdivided into two subscales: "Negotiation" is subdivided into "Cognitive" and "Emotional", while the other four categories are subdivided into "Minor" and "Severe." There are six items in "Negotiation", eight in "Psychological Aggression," twelve in "Physical Assault," seven in "Sexual Coercion," and six in "Injury."&lt;ref name=CTS2&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Straus | first1=Murray A. | last2=Hamby | first2=Sherry L. | last3=Boney-McCoy | first3=Susan | last4=Sugarman | first4=David B. | date=May 1996 | title=The Revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2): Development and Preliminary Psychometric Data | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CTS15.pdf | journal=Journal of Family Issues | volume=17 | issue=3 | pages=308–309 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | doi=10.1177/019251396017003001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples from each category include:

* ''Negotiation:'' "I showed I cared about my partner even though we disagreed" (emotional); "Suggested a compromise to a disagreement" (cognitive).
* ''Psychological Aggression:'' "Shouted or yelled at my partner" (minor); "Threatened to hit or throw something at my partner" (severe).
* ''Physical Assault:'' "Slapped my partner" (minor); "Kicked my partner" (severe)
* ''Sexual Coercion:'' "Insisted on sex when my partner did not want to (but did not use physical force)" (minor); "Used force (like hitting, holding down, or using a weapon) to make my partner have sex" (severe)
* ''Injury:'' "Had a sprain, bruise, or small cut because of a fight with my partner" (minor); "Needed to see a doctor because of a fight with my partner, but I didn't" (severe).&lt;ref name=CTS2/&gt;

CTS2 questions are presented in pairs. The first question in the pair asks respondents to indicate how often they carried out each item, in a range from "never" to "more than 20 times," in the referent period. The second asks how often the partner carried out each item within the same referent period. Default referent periods are usually 12 months, but other spans of time can be used.&lt;ref name=Straus191/&gt; Subscales measuring the degree of severity of "less severe" and "more severe" behaviors are included for all CTS scales, "based on the presumed greater harm resulting from acts in the severe subscale."&lt;ref name=Straus191/&gt; The severity of behaviors can also be measured by analyzing the frequency of the acts and by whether an injury was reported by the respondent.

===CTSPC===
The CTSPC (parent-child relationships) has scales to measure:
* physical assault (with subscales for [[corporal punishment]] and physical abuse),
* psychological aggression,
* non-violent [[discipline]] techniques.
The CTSPC also includes supplementary questions on instances of neglect, sexual abuse, and discipline in the past week.&lt;ref name=Straus1998 /&gt;

===Scoring===
There are many ways to score the CTS.&lt;ref name=Douglas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Straus1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=Straus1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Straus195/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Straus | first=Murray A. | date=July 23, 2004 | title=Scoring the CTS2 and CTSPC | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CTS28a3.pdf | journal=Family Research Laboratory, University of New Hampshire | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common scoring methods include:

* ''Prevalence'': Results in the percentage of respondents who reported being a victim of or perpetrating an item (or items) one or more times.&lt;ref name=Straus195/&gt;
* ''Frequency'': Results in the number of times an item occurred in the past year. A limitation of this score is that, for general population samples, "the distribution is so skewed that the [[mean]] is not an appropriate measure of central tendency." However, a sample of known offenders or victims will have a much higher frequency score "that can be very useful for measuring the chronicity of maltreatment."&lt;ref name=Straus195/&gt;
* ''Severity level and mutuality types'': The severity level classifies each case into three categories: "none", "minor only", or "severe". The mutuality types classify each case as "respondent only", "partner only", or "both". Straus writes "the mutuality types may be particularly useful in couples therapy because over a hundred studies have found that when there is violence, 50 percent or more of the time it is by both partners."&lt;ref name=Straus195/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Archer | first1=John | date=September 2000 | title=Sex Differences in Aggression between Heterosexual Partners: A Meta-Analytic Review | url=http://www.batteredmen.com/ArcherSexDifferencesMeta-AnalyticReviewf2000.pdf | journal=Psychological Bulletin | volume=126 | issue=5 | pages=651–680 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.5.651 | pmid=10989615}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Straus | first1=Murray A. | last2=Ramirez | first2=Ignacio | date=July 2007 | title=Gender symmetry in prevalence, severity, and chronicity of physical aggression against dating partners by university students in Mexico and USA. | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/ID12F.pdf | journal=Aggressive Behavior | volume=33 | issue=4 | pages=281–290 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | doi=10.1002/ab.20199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of the CTS argue it is an ineffective tool with which to measure IPV rate because, although it counts the number of acts of violence, it does not provide information about the context in which such acts occur (including the initiation, intention, history, or pattern of violence). Critics say such contexts cannot be divorced from the act itself, and therefore the CTS misrepresents the characteristics of violence between partners. Straus responds to this criticism by stating "the idea that the CTS physical assault scale is defective because it does not take into account the context, meaning, causes, and consequences of the violent acts is analogous to declaring a reading ability test invalid because it does not provide data on why a child reads poorly (such as limited exposure to books at home or test anxiety), or for not measuring the harmful effects of reading difficulty (such as low self-esteem or dropping out of school)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Straus | first1=Murray A. | editor-first=Nicky Ali | editor-last=Jackson | title=Encyclopedia of Domestic Violence | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=2007 | page=194 | chapter=Conflict Tactics Scales | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CTS44G.pdf | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Straus | first1=Murray A. | editor-first=M.R. | editor-last=Walsh | title=Women, Men and Gender: Ongoing Debates | publisher=Yale University Press | location=New Haven | year=1997 | page=218 | chapter=Physical Assaults by Women Partners: A Major Social Problem | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/VB33.pdf | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael S. Kimmel|Michael Kimmel]] says of this argument, "such an analogy is utterly inadequate. It is more akin to a teacher who doesn't look at how far off the spelling mistakes are or whether there is a pattern in the mistakes that might point to a physiological problem like dyslexia or some other learning disability, as compared to academic laziness, and thus leaving the learning problems untouched and misdirecting funds away from towards punitive after-school programs for lazy students."&lt;ref name="kimmel"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kimmel | first = Michael S. | author-link = Michael Kimmel | title = 'Gender symmetry' in domestic violence: a substantive and methodological research review | journal = [[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] | volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages = 1332–1363 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/107780102237407 | date = November 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/107780102237407 | ref = harv | postscript = . }} [http://www.vawnet.org/assoc_files_vawnet/gendersymmetry.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016110040/http://www.vawnet.org/assoc_files_vawnet/gendersymmetry.pdf |date=October 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common criticism is that the CTS carries ideological assumptions about domestic violence, such as the notion that partner violence is the result of an "argument" rather than an attempt to control one's partner.&lt;ref name="kimmel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vawnet.org/Assoc_Files_VAWnet/AR_ctscrit.pdf | title=Measuring the extent of woman abuse in intimate heterosexual relationships: a critique of the Conflict Tactics Scales | last1=DeKeseredy | first1= Walter S. | last2=Schwartz | first2=Martin D. | date=February 1998 | publisher=VAWnet.org | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the CTS asks about frequency only in the past twelve months and fails to detect ongoing systematic patterns of abuse.&lt;ref name="kimmel"/&gt; It also excludes incidents of violence that occur after separation and divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Flood | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Flood |title= Claims about 'husband battering' |journal= DVIRC Newsletter | pages = 3–8 |publisher= Domestic Violence and Incest Resource Centre, Melbourne |date= Summer 1999  |url= http://www.xyonline.net/content/claims-about-husband-battering | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.xyonline.net/sites/default/files/Flood,%20Husband%20Battering.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; The CTS also does not measure economic abuse, manipulation involving children, isolation, or intimidation – all common measures of violence from a victim-advocacy perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Power_and_Control_wheel_NCDSV.pdf |title=Power and Control Wheel |publisher=National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence |accessdate=May 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314062136/http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Power_and_Control_wheel_NCDSV.pdf |archivedate=March 14, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another methodological problem is that [[Inter-rater reliability|interobserver reliability]] (the likelihood that the two members of the measured [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]] respond similarly) is near zero for tested husband and wife couples. That is, the chances of a given couple reporting similar answers about events they both experienced is no greater than chance.&lt;ref name="dobash"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dobash | first1=Russel P. | last2=Dobash | first2=R.

'''Constructive journalism''' is an emerging domain within [[journalism]] that is slowly getting grounded within academia&lt;ref name="cg"&gt;Gyldensted, Cathrine [http://repository.upenn.edu/mapp_capstone/20/ "Innovating News Journalism through Positive Psychology"]. "University of Pennsylvania Scholarly Commons". 1 August 2011. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Alexander L. &amp; Hammonds, Keith H.  [http://engagingnewsproject.org/enp_2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ENP_SJN-report.pdf "The Power of Solutions Journalism"]. "University of Texas at Austin". 1 August 2014. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
and involves the field of communication that is based around reporting solution-focused news, instead of revolving only around negative and conflict-based stories. The idea behind constructive journalism is to give stories more context and make the consumer of the news more intelligent. By giving more background and also reporting what is going good, so that people are more able to create a realistic view of the world. Instead of only reporting the issues, with constructive journalism the journalist also addresses what the consumer can do with the information. What can I do to change it? etc. 

The journalist does not reflect his or her opinion and also does not render or implement what those solutions are, but tries to inform the society of what solutions there might be. Pioneers of constructive journalism say that as a journalist you have a big impact on the way people think, because of the way you construct the news. Journalists need to be aware of that responsibility more by being more careful in the way they construct their stories. They think that many journalist, who use a very cynical way of reporting the news, forget that by reporting everything that is going wrong from a distance, they also move the society.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;Gyldensted, Cathrine [https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/upworthy-media-role-climate-change-journalism/ "You will not believe what Upworthy can teach the media about sustainability"]. "The Guardian". 14 August 2014. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lbs&gt;Sillesen, Lene Bech [http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/good_news_is_good_business_but.php?page=all/ "Good news is good business, but not a cure-all for journalism"]. "Columbia Journalism Review". 29 September 2014. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It aims to avoid a negativity bias and incorporates findings from [[positive psychology]] research to produce novel frameworks for journalism.&lt;ref name="ivoh"&gt;Tenore, Mallary Jean [http://ivoh.org/constructive-journalism/ "How constructive journalism can improve the way media makers tell stories"]. "IVOH -Media as Agents of World Benefit". 2 September 2014. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, instead of solely reporting on conflicts and problems, constructive journalism aims to gain a more comprehensive portrayal of the issues at hand.&lt;ref name=ca&gt;Albeanu, Catalina [https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/why-constructive-journalism-can-help-engage-the-audience/s2/a557706/ "Why constructive journalism can help engage the audience"]. "Journalism.co.uk". 18 August 2014. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 
It aims to expose core causes of problems but also to report on emerging ideas and developments to shift society towards more impartial and sustainable paths.&lt;ref name=je&gt;Ellis, Justin [http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/01/with-knight-funding-solutions-journalism-network-wants-to-grow-reporting-on-positive-results-in-health-reporting/ "With Knight funding, Solutions Journalism Network wants to grow reporting on positive results in health reporting"]. "Nieman Foundation". 18 January 2014. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Constructive journalism aims express how change is possible and highlights the role each member of society may play to foster it. Additionally, it strives to strengthen the ethics code of journalism by avoiding the distortion of information in order to provide a more real portrayal of the world. Constructive Journalism attempts to create an engaging narrative that is factually correct without exaggerating numbers or realities.

== Applications ==

According to the Danish journalist [[Cathrine Gyldensted]], the Canadian [[Family therapy|family systems therapist]] [[Karl Tomm]]'s four types of therapeutic questioning can be adopted into an interview approach that can also be used by journalists.&lt;ref name="positivenews"&gt;Gyldensted, Cathrine. [http://positivenews.org.uk/2014/culture/media/16246/challenge-power-anew-family-therapy/ "How can we challenge power anew? Try family therapy"]. ''Positive News''. 12 September 2014. Retrieved 3 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Tomm's original framework provides four types of questions a therapist can use in [[psychotherapy]] sessions to bring about positive therapeutic outcomes from clients. By using the same model in journalism, similarly constructive answers could be obtained from the interviewee.

In what he named the "interventive interviewing" devised to facilitate positive changes in family dynamics, Tomm divides questions into four types based on two intersecting dimensions that make up four quadrants.&lt;ref name=tomm&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tomm |first=Karl |title=Interventive Interviewing: Part III. Intending to Ask Lineal, Circular, Strategic, or Reflexive Questions? |journal=Family Process |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |date=March 1988 |doi=10.1111/j.1545-5300.1988.00001.x |url=http://www.familytherapy.org/documents/Interventive3.PDF |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGiTJ-Z_y6Q Karl Tomm og de 4 spørgsmålstyper (Karl Tomm and the 4 types of question)]. ''YouTube.com''. Retrieved 2 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The first dimension of intentionality differentiates between "orienting questions" that help interviewers (therapists) orient their views about the interviewees (clients) and "influencing questions" that challenge the interviewees' (clients') understanding of themselves. When used outside psychotherapy, such as in journalism, this dimension of intentionality is also interpreted as the temporal dichotomy between past-orientation and future-orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Myllerup, Bent. [http://www.agile42.com/en/blog/2013/10/07/your-strategy-asking-powerful-questions/ "Your Strategy for Asking Powerful Questions"]. ''agile42''. 7 October 2013. Retrieved 2 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The second dimension of linear vs. circular assumptions, theoretically based on [[Gregory Bateson]]'s works on the nature of mind,&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, G. ''Steps to an ecology of mind''. New York: Ballantine Books, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, G. ''Mind and nature: A necessary unity''. New York: E.P. Dutton, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; differentiates between lineal assumptions that take a reductionist, deterministic approach and circular assumptions that take a holistic, systemic approach. The resulting four types of questions are:
# Linear Questions ("The Detective"): Basic investigative questions that deal with "Who did what?, Where?, When?, and Why?". This type of questions helps discover the factual aspect of the problem or issue.
# Circular Questions ("The Anthropologist"): This type of questions discovers relevant contextual perspective behind the facts. Examples: "How did this affect you (or other things/people/etc.)?" and "What is your explanation for A or B?".
# Reflexive Questions ("The Future Scientist"): In reflective questions, the interviewer suggests a new perspective on a given topic, thereby nudging the interviewee to reflect on a new possibility of constructive solutions to the problem or issue. Examples: "What do you think A believes, when he is in that situation?", "How would you approach this problem?", and "What action should be taken in order to do A or B?"
# Strategic Questions ("The Captain"): Directs the interviewee into commitment of the solution. Examples: "What should be done?", "Will you do it?", and "When will you do it?"

Gyldensted reports that conventional journalists tend to be past-oriented and hence leave out future-oriented questions, especially the "Future Scientist". &lt;ref name="cg" /&gt; For example, in a four-hour press conference with a former Danish prime minister, the press asked 59% "Detective", 19.4% "Captain", 18.7% "Anthropologist", and only 3% "Future Scientist" questions out of a total of more than 130 questions. "As a consequence," she writes, "[journalists] miss out on asking questions that explore new perspectives, solutions and visions, and on triggering actions based on those perspectives." An ideal, constructive interview requires a balance among all four types of questions, because "[a]n interview containing all four roles of questioning [...] reveals the problem and the involved parties (Detective), provides reflection on what has happened (Anthropologist), points towards a solution or maps a bigger vision (Future Scientist), and commits decision-makers (Captain)." These four types of questions, being grounded in family therapy, is especially effective in [[political journalism]], because the interviewer can encourage "mediation in political debates" and hence facilitate constructive collaboration among politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Gyldensted, Cathrine.

== Media corporations working with Constructive Journalism ==

In Scandinavia this domain has been evolving since 2007. 
In December 2007 the editor-in-chief and CEO of Danish Media corporation Berlingske Media, Lisbeth Knudsen, wrote an editorial where she reflected on the natural but also detrimental effects of journalism's negativity bias, and called for more positive and constructive story ideas.&lt;ref name=lk&gt;Knudsen, Lisbeth [http://lisbethknudsen.blogs.berlingske.dk/2007/12/01/gode-historier-er-negative-historier/ "Gode historier er negative historier"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221181806/http://lisbethknudsen.blogs.berlingske.dk/2007/12/01/gode-historier-er-negative-historier/ |date=2014-12-21 }}. "Berlingske". 1 December 2007. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Danish Broadcasting Corporation is working with constructive journalism in their news department, but not only there, also on regional stations like P4Fyn and DR Danmark.&lt;ref&gt;Andresen, Sidsel.

"University of Southern Denmark- Center of Journalism". May 2012. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden's Television/SVT and Sweden's Radio/SR have implemented constructive journalism as part of their everyday method and framework.  Dutch online media outlet De Correspondent in The Netherlands have named a correspondent for progress and a constructive correspondent as part of their newsroom staff.&lt;ref&gt;Gyldensted, Cathrine [https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2014/oct/24/constructive-journalism-de-correspondent/ "How journalists could be more constructive – and boost audiences"]. "The Guardian". 24 October 2014. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Huffington Post launched their special sections experimenting on constructive journalism in 2011 with Washington Post following in 2014 with an online section labelled "The Optimist".&lt;ref name=lbs&gt;Sillesen, Lene Bech [http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/good_news_is_good_business_but.php?page=all/ "Good news is good business, but not a cure-all for journalism"]. "Columbia Journalism Review". 29 September 2014. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Belgian national French-speaking media [[RTBF]] has launched in late 2012 a monthly magazine in coproduction with 7 local walloon televisions,&lt;ref&gt;Canal C, Canal Zoom, No Télé, Télé Sambre, Télé Vesdre, Télé MB, TV Lux&lt;/ref&gt; called "Alors, on change!".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alorsonchange.be&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim is to make portraits of citizens involved in transition, aiming at giving positive and inspirational examples of behavioral change to viewers.

[[File:Algeria (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|Location of [[Algeria]]]]
This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Algeria]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

Ninety-one percent of the Algerian population lives along the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast on 12% of the country's total land mass. Forty-five percent of the population is urban, and [[urbanization]] continues, despite government efforts to discourage migration to the cities. Currently, 24,182,736 Algerians live in [[urban area]]s, and about 1.5 millions nomads live in the [[Sahara]]n area.

96% of the population follows [[Sunni Islam]]; the few non-Sunni Muslims are mainly [[Ibadi]]s from the [[Mozabite people|Mozabite]] valley at 1.3% and [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]] (see [[Islam in Algeria]]). 

[[Christianity in Algeria]] constitutes about 1% of the total population. While significantly greater during the [[French Algeria|French colonial years]], a mostly foreign Roman Catholic community still exists, as do some Protestants. The [[Jews in Algeria|Jewish community of Algeria]], which once constituted 2% of the total population, has substantially decreased due to emigration, mostly to France and Israel.

Algeria's educational system has grown rapidly since 1962; in the last 12 years{{when|date=April 2016}}, attendance has doubled to more than 5 million students. Education is free and compulsory to age 16. Despite government allocation of substantial educational resources, population pressures and a serious shortage of teachers have severely strained the system, as have [[terrorism|terrorist]] attacks against the educational infrastructure during the 1990s. Modest numbers of Algerian students study abroad, primarily in [[France]] and French-speaking [[Canada]]. In 2000, the government launched a major review of the country's educational system.

Housing and medicine continue to be pressing problems in Algeria. Failing infrastructure and the continued influx of people from rural to urban areas has overtaxed both systems. According to the [[UNDP]], Algeria has one of the world's highest per housing unit occupancy rates for housing, and government officials have publicly stated that the country has an immediate shortfall of 1.5 million housing units.

Algerians are descendants from the berbers, who are the indigenous ethnic group of Algeria and are believed to be the ancestral stock on which elements from the [[Phoenicians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantines]], [[Arab people|Arabs]], [[Turkish people|Turks]] as well as other ethnic groups have contributed to the [[ethnic]] makeup of Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UNESCO |year=2009 |title=Diversité et interculturalité en Algérie |url=http://rabat.unesco.org/IMG/pdf/Diversite_InterculturalitAlgerie.pdf |publisher=UNESCO |page=9 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725111743/http://rabat.unesco.org/IMG/pdf/Diversite_InterculturalitAlgerie.pdf |archivedate=July 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Descendants of [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] refugees are also present in the population of Algiers and other cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIRWgrbE_fEC&amp;pg=PA22 |title=Modern Algeria&amp;nbsp;– The Origins and Development of a Nation |page=22 |author=Ruedy, John Douglas |publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253217820|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] was spoken by these [[Aragon]]ese and [[Castilian people|Castillian]] [[Moriscos|Morisco]] descendants deep into the 18th century, and even [[Catalan language|Catalan]] was spoken at the same time by [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[Moriscos|Morisco]] descendants in the small town of Grish El-Oued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Epalza|first=Mikel|title=El español hablado en Túnez por los moriscos (siglos XVII-XVIII)|year=2011|publisher=Universitat de València|pages=32–38–39–444|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7_VKzdSIzwC&amp;printsec=frontcover|isbn=9788437084152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Algerian Arabic]] (Algerian Dziriya or Darja) is the language used by the majority of the population. Colloquial Algerian Arabic is heavily infused with loanwords from Berber and French.

Although French has no official status, Algeria is the second-largest Francophone country in the world in terms of speakers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.senat.fr/colloques/actes_mondialisation_francophonie/actes_mondialisation_francophonie10.html |title=La mondialisation, une chance pour la francophonie |publisher=Senat.fr |accessdate=17 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FhBDeanP?url=http://www.senat.fr/colloques/actes_mondialisation_francophonie/actes_mondialisation_francophonie10.html |archivedate=7 April 2013 |df= }} () "L'Algérie, non-membre de l'Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, comptabilise la seconde communauté francophone au monde, avec environ 16 millions de locuteurs, suivie par la Côte d'Ivoire avec près de 12 millions de locuteurs francophones, le Québec avec 6 millions et la Belgique avec plus de 4 millions de francophones."&lt;/ref&gt; and French is widely used in government, media (newspapers, radio, local television), and both the education system (from primary school onwards) and academia due to [[French rule in Algeria|Algeria's colonial history]]. It can be regarded as the ''de facto'' co-official language of Algeria. In 2008, 11.2 million Algerians could read and write in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Le dénombrement des francophones |url=http://www.francophonie.org/IMG/pdf/1e.pdf |publisher=Organisation internationale de la Francophonie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FhBO8XsN?url=http://www.francophonie.org/IMG/pdf/1e.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-07 |df= }} () p. 9 "Nous y agrégeons néanmoins quelques données disponibles pour des pays n’appartenant pas à l’OIF mais dont nous savons, comme pour l’Algérie (11,2 millions en 2008&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)," and "1.

In recent decades the government has reinforced the study of French and TV programs have reinforced use of the language.

Algeria emerged as a bilingual state after 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=New |first=The |url=http://topics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/algerias-liberation-terrorism-and-arabization/ |title=Algeria's liberation terrorism and Arabization |publisher=blogs.nytimes.com |date= 19 November 2008|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colloquial [[Algerian Arabic]] is spoken by about 72% of the population and Berber by 27–30%.&lt;ref name="leclerc"&gt;{{cite web | author=Leclerc, Jacques | title=''Algérie: Situation géographique et démolinguistique'' | website=L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde | language=French | publisher=[[Université Laval]] | date=5 April 2009 | url=http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/AXL/AFRIQUE/algerie-1demo.htm | accessdate=8 January 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124150058/http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/afrique/algerie-1demo.htm | archivedate=24 January 2010 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent genetic study by Semino et al. (2004), Algerian Arabs and Berbers were found to have more genetic similarities than was once believed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Semino et al. (2004), [http://hpgl.stanford.edu/publications/AJHG_2004_v74_p1023-1034.pdf Origin, Diffusion, and Differentiation of Y-Chromosome Haplogroups E and J] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709064219/http://hpgl.stanford.edu/publications/AJHG_2004_v74_p1023-1034.pdf |date=2011-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led scientists to conclude that the North African population was mainly Berber in origin and that the population had been 'Arabised', by the migration of Near-Eastener people.

The Haplogroup J, common marker in [[Middle-Eastern]] population is found at near 30% in [[Algeria]], which is one of the most common haplogroup of the country along with E1b1b .

Recent studies on the common J1 Y chromosome suggest it arrived over ten thousand years ago in North Africa, and M81/E3b2 is a Y chromosome specific to North African ancestry, dating to the Neolithic. A thorough study by Arredi et al. (2004) which analyzed populations from Algeria concludes that the North African pattern of Y-chromosomal variation (including both E3b2 and J haplogroups is largely of Neolithic origin, which suggests that the Neolithic transition in this part of the world was accompanied by demic diffusion of Afro-Asiatic–speaking pastoralists from the Middle East. This Neolithic origin was later confirmed by Myles et al. (2005) which suggest that "contemporary Berber populations possess the genetic signature of a past migration of pastoralists from the Middle East",&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;although later papers have suggested that this date could have been as longas ten thousand years ago, with the transition from the Oranian to the Capsian culture in North Africa.

The people of [[Cyprus]] are broadly divided into two main ethnic communities, [[Greek Cypriots]] and [[Turkish Cypriots]], who share many cultural traits but maintain distinct identities based on ethnicity, religion, language, and close ties with their respective motherlands. Before the dispute started in 1964 the peoples of Cyprus (then 77% Greek Cypriots, 18% Turkish Cypriots, 5% other communities, including [[Armenians in Cyprus|Armenians]] and [[Maronite Church|Maronites]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/cyprus/21.htm Eric Solsten, ed. ''Cyprus: A Country Study''], Library of Congress, Washington, DC, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; were dispersed over the entire island.

The [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974 [[de facto]] partitioned the island into two political areas: 99.5% of Greek Cypriots now live in the Republic of Cyprus while 98.7% of Turkish Cypriots live in Northern Cyprus (of other nationalities, 99.2% live in the Greek Cypriot area in the south).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldpress.org/profiles/cyprus.cfm Cyprus Facts] on Worldpress.org. Retrieved 29 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greek language|Greek]] is predominantly spoken in the South, where the majority are Greek Cypriots, [[Turkish language|Turkish]] in the north, where the majority are Turkish Cypriots&lt;!-- and immigrants from [[Turkey]] : see chat --&gt;. [[English language|English]] is widely used throughout the island, as a [[common language]].

The total population of Cyprus as of the end of 2006 is slightly over 1 million, comprising 789,300 in the territory controlled by the government of the Republic of Cyprus&lt;ref name="DEMOGRAPHIC REPORT 2007"&gt;Statistical Service of the Republic of Cyprus, [http://www.mof.gov.cy/mof/cystat/statistics.nsf/All/1A87FF0C4E254CC1C22571FE002D4AD4/$file/DEMOGRAPHIC_REPORT-2007.pdf DEMOGRAPHIC REPORT 2007] (p. 12)&lt;/ref&gt; and 294,406 in Northern Cyprus. The population of Northern Cyprus includes some 150,000–160,000 Turkish immigrants who are regarded as illegal settlers by the Republic of Cyprus government and are not included in the population statistics of the Republic of Cyprus Statistical Service.&lt;ref name=cyportal&gt;[http://www.cyprus.gov.cy/portal/portal.nsf/All/817E9279C04E4480C2257023002B858C?OpenDocument&amp;a=4&amp;z= Cyprus Government web portal: Towns and Population].

==Historical population==
Turkish Cypriots were the majority of the population registered for taxation between 1777 and 1800.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/excerptacypriama00cobhuoft Claude Delaval Cobham] Excerpta Cypria, Cambridge University Press, 1908, p.366-67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cypruslibrary.moec.gov.cy/ebooks/36821 Archimandrite Kyprianos] Istoria Khronoloyiki tis Nisou Kiprou (History and Chronicles of the Island of Cyprus, Ιστορία χρονολογική της νήσου Κύπρου) 1788, p.495&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is likely that the [[Muslim]] population never exceeded 35-40 per cent of the total population of Cyprus. Rather, many [[Orthodox Christians]] registered as [[Muslims]] in order to reduce taxation from their occupiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inalcik.com/images/pdfs/52721689STATUSOFGREEKORTHODOXPATRiARCH.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the census from 1881 to 1960, all Muslims are counted as Turks, only Greek Orthodox are counted as Greeks. There were small populations of Greek-speaking Muslims and Turkish-speaking Greek Orthodox.&lt;ref&gt;A Handbook of Cyprus, Hutchinson, Joseph Turner, page 57, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, between 1955 and 1973, 16,519 Turks and 71,036 Greeks emigrated from the country. Of the emigrated Turkish Cypriots in this period, only 290 went to Turkey.&lt;ref name="Mete Hatay 2007, page 64"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://file.prio.no/publication_files/Cyprus/Report%202007-2%20Is%20the%20Turkish%20Cypriot%20Population%20Shrinking.pdf |title=Is the Turkish Cypriot population shrinking?: an overview of the ethno-demography of Cyprus in the light of the preliminary results of the 2006 Turkish-Cypriot census |first=Mete |last=Hatay |publisher=International Peace Research Institute |year=2007 |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 census, 208 people stated their ethnic origin as being [[Catholic Church in Cyprus|Latin]].&lt;ref name="census2011" /&gt;

==Immigration==
{{main article|Mainland Turks in Northern Cyprus}}
Large-scale demographic changes have been caused since 1964 by the movements of peoples across the island and the later influx of settlers from Turkey to Northern Cyprus. According to the 2011 Census there are 170,383 non-citizens living in Cyprus, of whom 106,270 are EU citizens and 64,113 are from third countries. The largest EU groups by nationality are Greeks (29,321), British (24,046), Romanians (23,706) and Bulgarians (18,536). The largest non-EU groups are Filipinos (9,413), Russians (8,164), Sri Lankans (7,269) and Vietnamese (7,028).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyprus-mail.com/population-census/greeks-main-group-foreigners-living-island/20120720 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723202524/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/population-census/greeks-main-group-foreigners-living-island/20120720 |archivedate=2012-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated 20–25,000 undocumented migrants from third countries also living in the Republic, though migrant rights groups dispute these figures.&lt;ref&gt;http://cms.horus.be/files/99907/MediaArchive/Events/Study_Visits/KISA%20Intervention.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The demographic changes in society have led to some racist incidents,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=43171 "My girl thought she was going to die"] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=34878&amp;cat_id=1 "Why the Republic of Cyprus is institutionally racist"] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=44660 "Teen says beaten and mocked by police in racist incident"]&lt;/ {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the formation of the charity [[KISA (NGO)|KISA]] in response.

The demographic character of [[Northern Cyprus]] changed after the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish invasion]] in 1974 and especially during the last 10–15 years. The so called “TRNC census” carried out in April 2006 showed that out of a total population of 256,644 in Northern Cyprus, 132,635, or 52%, were Turkish Cypriots in the sense that they were born in Cyprus of at least one Cyprus-born parent (for 120,007 of these both parents were Cyprus-born). In addition, 43,062 so called “TRNC citizens” (17%) had at least one non-Cypriot Turkish-born parent, 2,334 so called “TRNC citizens” (1%) had parents born in other countries, 70,525 residents (27%) had Turkish citizenship, and 8,088 (3%) were citizens of other countries (mainly UK, Bulgaria, and Iran).&lt;ref name=TRNC2006/&gt;

Based on these census data, it is estimated that 113,687 Northern Cyprus residents, or 44% of the population, are not Turkish Cypriots properly speaking, but are in fact "Turkish immigrants" or "Turkish settlers" from Anatolia. Alternative sources suggest that there are 146,122 Turkish settlers from Anatolia in Northern Cyprus (2007 figures)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calisma.gov.tr/ Çalışma Sosyal Güvenlik Bakanlığı&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123093639/http://www.calisma.gov.tr/ |date=2016-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2009}} and that the Turkish Cypriots in Northern Cyprus are today outnumbered by the Turkish settlers,&lt;ref&gt;The Turkish Settlers in Northern Cyprus, www.cyprus-conflict.net, quoting "Fresh Tension for Cyprus: Counting the Newcomers" in ''The New York Times'', January 23, 1991.{{cite web|url=http://www.cyprus-conflict.net/turkish_settlers.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325092512/http://www.cyprus-conflict.net/turkish_settlers.htm |archivedate=2008-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to the picture presented by the 2006 so called “TRNC census”.

Almost one-third of the Turkish settlers in Northern Cyprus have been granted “TRNC citizenship” by the so called “authorities” of Northern Cyprus and have thus been naturalized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zaman.com/?bl=hotnews&amp;alt=&amp;trh=20060506&amp;hn=32847 Today's Zaman&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302233707/http://www.zaman.com/?bl=hotnews&amp;alt=&amp;trh=20060506&amp;hn=32847 |date=2012-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2009}} The Republic of Cyprus regards settlement in Northern Cyprus, especially if accompanied by naturalization, as a violation of the [[Geneva Conventions]] Protocol of 1977, since the Turkish occupation has been declared illegal by the UN. It therefore considers these Turkish immigrants to be "illegal settlers" and does not include them in the population estimates for the entire island published by the Republic of Cyprus Statistical Service.&lt;ref name=2007abstract/&gt;

'''Desikar''' (தேசிகர்) or '''Desigar''' is a [[Tamil language|Tamil]]-speaking Veerasaiva community from the [[Indian state]]s of [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]]. They are particularly priests and land owners..

==Origin of Desikar==

The Desikar community is a very ancient one which promotes the [[Shaivism|Saivite]] religion. This community especially focuses on Lingayatham, Saiva Siddhanta and Thirumurai.
The caste Desikar or  [[Desigar]] is derived from word Pandaram, meaning "sage" in [[Tamil language|Tamil]].
There are different theories concerning the meaning of the word Pandaram.
The caste Pandaram comprises two divisions, [[Abhisheka]] and Desikar.
But the later name Desikar as taken as a back title.

==Dhikshai process==
Those who lead a celibate life wear lingam. They became Saivas by getting Dhikshai.

*"Samaya"
*"Nirvana, Visesha"
*"Kala sothanai" 
*"Abhishekam"

are the few stages of Dhikshai practice.

Few of them are temple servants, supply flowers for God, Sings hymns in temple.
So, they used to be called ''Meikaval'' (Bodyguard of the God) and Oduvar (reader).

==Divisions in Pandarathar==
Desikar is a sub-division of community known as 'Pandarathar'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Erin3nkU3ZUC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=desikar+caste&amp;source=web&amp;ots=1KVXzsugkC&amp;sig=smHG0N75t8rQ8jx1h0i7UEjlyzA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#PPA46,M1|title=Castes and Tribes of Southern India|last=Thurston|first=Edgar|last2=Rangachari|first2=K.|date=2001|publisher=Asian Educational Services|year=|isbn=9788120602885|location=|pages=46|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=too old|date=July 2012}} The Pandarathar caste is composed of respectable people. The name ''pandarathar'' means valuable storing place of jewels, navarathnas stored in the temples and palaces, they are placed to maintain the jewels of temples and palaces. They are Land holders, Traders, Sanyasis (monk), Priests (guru) and Managers of richly endowed temples.

These managers are commonly called ''Thambiran''. They are all vegetarians and staunch believers of Saiva Siddantha.

Abhisheka Pandaram has to pass through few ceremonies related to Saiva Agama.

The mendigate pandarams, recruited from a few other classes, wear the lingam but do not abstain from eating flesh.

The Lingayat pandarathar are known as lingayats.

The latter respect their [[Jangam]] and used the sacred water, in which the feet of  the [[Jangam]] are washed, for washing their stone lingam.

Some of the sub-castes of the predominant Desikar community are
* Desikar
* Abhisheka
* Oduvar
*  Meikaval

==Distribution==

==Desikar Mutts in brief ==

The pioneer who established Adheenam ( Mutts, Dynasty) are known as   "Desikar" or "Desikar Paramacharya", ''pontiff'' in English. Most of the pontiffs are Brahamacharis maintains celibacy. Only a few became Samsaris. So only few mutts followed the successive pontiff by lineage. But most of the Adheenam select the pontiff by "Guru Shishya Parambara". Ancient Tamil history pronounces that Saivaite religion or sector doesn't have the casteism. After the invasion of the other races, casteism dominate  a prominent role in the Saivaite unknowingly. so. the successive pontiffs are selected or elected from the so-called various communities. Hence few of the mutts only at the hands of Desika Paramacharya lineage.

The Velakurichi mutt was founded in the 15th century on the banks of Thamirabarani River in Velakurichi village, a part of Ambasamudram Taluk, Thirunelvely District.

The '''Dungan language''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ʊ|ŋ|ɡ|ɑː|n}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ʌ|ŋ|g|ə|n}}) is a [[varieties of Chinese|Sinitic language]]&lt;ref&gt;Different from [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] in phonology and lexicon. [http://www.ethnologue.com/language/dng]&lt;/ref&gt; spoken primarily in [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] by the [[Dungan people]], an ethnic group related to the [[Hui people]] of [[China]].  Although it is derived from the [[Central Plains Mandarin]] of [[Gansu]] and [[Shaanxi]], it is primarily written in [[Cyrillic]] and contains loanwords and archaisms not found in other modern varieties of Mandarin.

==History==
The Dungan people of [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] (with smaller groups living in other post-Soviet states) are the descendants of several groups of the [[Hui people]] that migrated to the region in the 1870s and the 1880s after the defeat of the [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|Dungan revolt]] in Northwestern China. The Hui of Northwestern China (often referred to as "Dungans" or "Tungani" by the 19th-century western writers as well as by members of Turkic nationalities in China and Central Asia) would normally speak the same Mandarin dialect as the Han people in the same area&lt;ref name=g393&gt;[[Dru C. Gladney]], ''Muslim Chinese: Ethnic Nationalism in the People's Republic''. 1st ed.: Harvard University Press, 1991, {{ISBN|0-674-59495-9}}; 2nd ed., 1996. {{ISBN|0-674-59497-5}}. Pages 393-394 in the 1991 edition. The following pages in this book, 321–395, are occupied by "A Select Glossary of Hui Chinese Islamic Terms", into which Gladney included only words (many found in older publications) that he could verify as known or recognized by people in at least some Hui communities he visited.&lt;/ref&gt; (or in the area from which the particular Hui community had been resettled). At the same time, due to their unique history, their speech would be rich in [[Islamic]] or Islam-influenced terminology, based on loanwords from Arabic, Persian, and Turkic languages, as well as translations of them into Chinese.&lt;ref name=g393/&gt;  The Hui traders in the bazaars would be able to use Arabic or Persian numbers when talking between themselves, to keep their communications secret from Han bystanders.&lt;ref&gt;Gladney (1991), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; While not constituting a separate language, these words, phrases and turns of speech, known as ''Huihui hua'' ({{lang|dng|回回話}}, "Hui speech"), served as markers of group identity.&lt;ref name=g393/&gt; As early 20th century travellers in Northwestern China would note, "the Mohammedan Chinese have to some extent a vocabulary, and always a style and manner of speech, all their own".&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Lattimore]], ''The Desert Road to Turkestan''. London, Methuen &amp; Co, ca. 1928–1929. Page 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Dungans in the Russian Empire, and even more so in the Soviet Union, were isolated from China, their language experienced significant influence from the [[Russian language|Russian]] and the Turkic languages of their neighbors.

In the Soviet Union, a written standard of the Dungan language was developed, based on a [[Gansu]] dialect, rather than the Beijing base of [[Standard Chinese]]. The language was used in the schools in Dungan villages. In the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] time there were several school textbooks published for studying the Dungan language, a three volume Russian–Dungan dictionary (14,000 words), the Dungan–Russian dictionary, [[linguistics]] monographs on the language and books in Dungan. The first Dungan-language newspaper was established in 1932; it continues publication today in weekly form.

When [[Dru C. Gladney]], who had spent some years working with the Hui people in China, met with Dungans in [[Almaty]] in 1988, he described the experience as speaking "in a hybrid Gansu dialect that combined Turkish and Russian lexical items".&lt;ref&gt;Gladney, pp 33, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutual intelligibility with Mandarin dialects==
There is a varying degree of mutual intelligibility between Dungan and various Mandarin dialects. The [[Zhongyuan Mandarin|Shaanxi and Gansu Mandarin dialects]] are understood by Dungans. On the other hand, Dungan speakers like [[Yasyr Shivaza]] and others have reported that Chinese who speak [[Beijing dialect|Beijing Mandarin dialect]] can understand Dungan, but Dungans could not understand the Beijing Mandarin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Svetlana|last=Rimsky-Korsakoff Dyer|title=Soviet Dungan nationalism: a few comments on their origin and language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZoNCAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=shivaza&amp;dq=shivaza|journal=Monumenta Serica|volume=33|year=1977|pages=349–362|accessdate=2011-02-15}} p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Dungan is spoken primarily in [[Kyrgyzstan]], with speakers in [[Kazakhstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], and [[Russia]] as well. The Dungan ethnic group are the descendants of refugees from China who migrated west into Central Asia.

According to the Soviet census statistics from 1970 to 1989, the Dungan maintained the use of their ethnic language much more successfully than other minority ethnic groups in Central Asia; however, in the post-Soviet period, the proportion of Dungans speaking the Dungan language as their native language appears to have fallen sharply.

==Grammar==

===Classifiers===
Chinese varieties usually have different [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] for different types of nouns, with northern varieties tending to have fewer classifiers than southern ones. {{lang|zh|個}} {{IPA-all|kə|}} is the only classifier found in the Dungan language, though not the only [[measure word]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Yue | first = Anne O. | chapter = Chinese dialects: grammar | editor1-first = Graham | editor1-last = Thurgood | editor2-first = Randy J. (eds.) | editor2-last = LaPolla | title = The Sino-Tibetan languages | publisher = Routledge | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-7007-1129-1 | pages = 84–125 | url = https://books.google.de/books?id=YlyuDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT175&amp;dq=dunganese&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5wqbN8MHRAhUK3SwKHe4pDuM4ChDoAQgpMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=dunganese&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
In basic structure and vocabulary, the Dungan language is not very different from [[Mandarin Chinese]], specifically a variety of [[Zhongyuan Mandarin]] (not Lan-Yin Mandarin)  spoken in the southern part  of the province of [[Gansu]] and the western part of the valley of [[Guanzhong]]  in the province of [[Shaanxi]]. Like other [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]], Dungan is tonal. There are two main dialects, one with 4 tones, and the other, considered standard, with 3 tones in the final position in phonetic words and 4 tones in the nonfinal position.

==Vocabulary==
The [[basilect]]s of Gansu/Shaanxi Mandarin and Dungan are largely [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]]; Chinese journalists conversant in one of those Mandarin dialects report that they can make themselves understood when communicating with Dungan speakers. However, even at the level of basic vocabulary, Dungan contains many words not present in modern Mandarin dialects, such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] [[loanwords]], as well as archaic [[Qing dynasty]]-era Chinese vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The "Shaanxi Village" in Kazakhstan | publisher = China Radio International - CRIENGLISH.com | date = 2004-07-09 | url = http://en.chinabroadcast.cn/1857/2004-7-9/53@130293.htm | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060424085207/http://en.chinabroadcast.cn/1857/2004-7-9/53@130293.htm | archivedate = 2006-04-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[acrolect]]s of Dungan and Gansu/Shaanxi Mandarin have diverged significantly due to time and cultural influences.  During the 20th century, translators and intellectuals introduced many [[neologism]]s and [[calque]]s into the Chinese language, especially for political and technical concepts. However, the Dungan, cut off from the mainstream of Chinese discourse by orthographic barriers, instead borrowed words for those same concepts from [[Russian language|Russian]], with which they came into contact through government and higher education. As a result of these borrowings, the equivalent standard Chinese terms are not widely known or understood among the Dungan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mair | first = Victor | authorlink = Victor H. Mair | title = Implications of the Soviet Dungan Script for Chinese Language Reform | journal = Sino-Platonic Papers | issue = 18 | date = May 1990 | url = http://www.pinyin.info/readings/texts/dungan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing system==
The modern Dungan language is the only spoken Chinese that is written in the Cyrillic alphabet, as they lived under the Soviet rule. It is a Russian-based alphabet plus five special letters: Җ, Ң, Ү, Ә, and Ў. As such, it differs somewhat from the [[Cyrillization of Chinese|Palladius System]] that is normally used in Russia to write Chinese in Cyrillic.

Dungan is unique in that it is one of the few [[varieties of Chinese]] that is not normally written using [[Chinese character]]s. Originally the Dungan, who were [[Muslim]] descendants of the [[Hui people|Hui]], wrote their language in an [[Arabic script|Arabic]]-based alphabet known as [[Xiao'erjing]]. The [[Soviet Union]] banned all Arabic scripts in the late 1920s, which led to a [[Latin script|Latin]] orthography.   The Latin orthography lasted until 1940, when the Soviet government promulgated the current [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]-based system. Xiao'erjing is now virtually extinct in Dungan society, but it remains in limited use by some Hui communities in China.

The writing system is based on the standard 3-tone dialect. Tones marks or numbering do not appear in general-purpose writing, but are specified in dictionaries, even for [[loanword]]s.

== Literature ==
A number of books in Dungan language, including textbooks, Dungan-Russian and Russian-Dungan dictionaries, a Dungan etymological dictionary, collections of folk tales, original and translated fiction and poetry have been published in Kyrgyzstan. Usual print runs were no more than a few hundred copies. A newspaper in Dungan has been published as well.

Works of the Dungan poet [[Iasyr Shivaza|Yasir Shiwaza]] have been translated into Russian, Standard Chinese, and a number of other languages, with print runs in some of them been much higher than in the original Dungan. English translations of some of them, along with the original Dungan text, are available in the book by S. Rimsky-Korsakoff (1991).

'''Ecuadorian Sign Language''' is the [[deaf sign language]] of [[Ecuador]].

==Classification==
Wittmann (1991)&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Wittmann|Wittmann, Henri]] (1991).  "Classification linguistique des langues signées non vocalement." Revue québécoise de linguistique théorique et appliquée 10:1.215–88.[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1991a-class.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; posits that ESL is a language isolate (a 'prototype' sign language), though one developed through [[stimulus diffusion]] from an existing sign language, likely [[French Sign Language]].

'''Fazal Hayat'''&lt;ref name="Ahmed"/&gt; (1974 – 14 June 2018), more commonly known by his pseudonym ''' Fazlullah''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|ملا فضل اللہ}}}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=Laura|title=Confusion hangs over Pakistan's pact with Taliban|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=24 February 2009|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pakistan-swat24-2009feb24,0,4127783.story|accessdate=24 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an Islamist militant who has served as the leader of the [[Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi]], an organisation aiming to enforce their interpretation of [[Sharia]] in [[Pakistan]], and was the leader of the Tehreek-e-Taliban-e-Pakistan in [[Swat District|Swat Valley]].&lt;ref name="et20111017"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc20090710/&gt; On 7 November 2013, he became the [[emir]] of the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan]], and presided over the descent of the group into factions who are often at war with each other. Fazlullah was added to the U.S. State Department's [[Rewards for Justice]] wanted list on 7 March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rewardsforjustice.net/english/maulana_fazlullah.html|title=Rewards for Justice - Wanted for Terrorism - Maulana Fazlullah|author=|date=|website=rewardsforjustice.net|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fazlullah was killed in a U.S. drone strike in [[Afghanistan]] on 14 June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pakistan-taliban-leader-mullah-fazlullah-killed-us-drone-strike-afghanistan/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Fazlullah was born Fazal Hayat in 1974 to Biladar Khan, a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] of Babukarkhel clan of the [[Yusufzai (Pashtun tribe)|Yusufzai tribe]] of the [[Swat District]] of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Khurshid|last=Khan |url=http://www.valleyswat.net/articles/fazalullah_interview.html|title=Exclusive: An interview with Fazalullah|publisher=Valley Swat|date=21 April 2007|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roggio"&gt;Roggio, Bill (7 July 2007) [http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2007/07/swat_joins_talibanis.php "Swat joins Talibanistan"] ''The Long War Journal'' Public Multimedia Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; He married the daughter of [[Sufi Muhammad]], the founder of [[Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi]]. It is rumored that Fazullah kidnapped Sufi Muhammmad's daughter as a student in Sufi Muhammad Madrassa. [[MSNBC]], a news channel in the [[United States]], obtained a photo&lt;ref name=grisanti/&gt; of Fazlullah in January 2008.

==Militant activity==

=== Operations in Pakistan ===

===TNSM in Swat===
On 12 January 2002, Fazlullah became the leader of [[Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi]] (TNSM) due to the enforcement of a ban by [[Pervez Musharraf]], former President of Pakistan. The ban led to the arrest and capture of Sufi Muhammad, which placed Fazlullah into the leadership role.&lt;ref name="satp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/pakistan/terroristoutfits/TNSM.htm|title=Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi (TSNM), Extremist Group of Pakistan|publisher=SATP|accessdate=19 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="satp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jamestown"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=986#.VTP_1fzF-ZM |title=The Black-Turbaned Brigade: The Rise of TNSM in Pakistan |author=Hassan Abbas |publisher=Jamestown Foundation |date=12 April 2006 |accessdate=19 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930192222/http://jamestown.org/news_details.php?news_id=209 |archivedate=30 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Sufi Muhammad was freed in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7359523.stm|title=Top Pakistani militant released|work=[[BBC News]]|date=21 April 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.bbc.co.uk%2F2%2Fhi%2Fsouth_asia%2F7359523.stm&amp;date=2009-04-17|archivedate=17 April 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; he did not seek to usurp Fazlullah's leadership in the TNSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Toosi |first=Nahal |title=Taliban to cease fire in Pakistan's Swat Valley |publisher=Yahoo News |date=2 May 2009 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090215/ap_on_re_as/as_pakistan |accessdate=15 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216212653/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090215/ap_on_re_as/as_pakistan |archivedate=16 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fazlullah managed to restore the organization, bootstrapping on the relief efforts by Islamist extremist groups following the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake|8 October 2005-earthquake]].&lt;ref name="satp"/&gt; New cadres then began moving into the [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat Valley]]. Fazlullah was allegedly arrested by Pakistani security forces while coming back from Afghanistan. While in prison, Sufi Muhammad (his father in law) changed his name from Fazal Hayat to Fazlullah. While imprisoned, Fazlullah studied from a variety of religious books that were provided by Sufi Muhammad. These books included the Holy Qur'an translation and "Tafseer." In February 2009, Sufi Muhammad assisted in the negotiation of a cease fire between TNSM forces and the Pakistani army. As part of the cease fire Pakistan  [[Nizam-e-Adl Regulation 2009|agreed to allow Sharia law]] in [[Malakand District]].&lt;ref name=aliz2009217&gt;{{cite news|last=Ali|first=Zulfiqar|author2=Laura King|title=Pakistan officials allow Sharia in volatile region|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=17 February 2009|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pakistan-pact17-2009feb17,0,6631935.story| accessdate=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcshariadeal&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7891955.stm|title=Pakistan agrees Sharia law deal|work=BBC News|date=16 February 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.bbc.co.uk%2F2%2Fhi%2Fsouth_asia%2F7891955.stm&amp;date=2009-04-17|archivedate=17 April 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alliance with Tehrik-e-Taliban====
In the aftermath of the 2007 [[siege of Lal Masjid]], Fazlullah's forces and [[Baitullah Mehsud]]'s [[Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan]] (TTP) formed an alliance. Fazlullah and his army henceforth reportedly received orders from Mehsud.&lt;ref name=rehmatk&gt;{{cite news|last=Rehmat|first=Kamran|title=Swat: Pakistan's lost paradise|work=[[Al Jazeera]]

====Parallel government====
With the support of more than 4,500 militants, by late October 2007 Fazlullah had established a "parallel government" in 59 villages in [[Swat District|Swat Valley]] by starting Islamic courts to enforce sharia law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Qayum|first=Khalid|author2=Khaleeq Ahmed|title=Pakistan Deploys Troops in Swat to Curb Militants (Update 1)|work=Bloomberg News|date=25 October 2007|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&amp;sid=akTcKrCtbmWE&amp;refer=uk

On 10 July 2009, [[BBC]] reported that Fazlullah was near death after being critically wounded, corroborating statements made by senior government and security officials in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=bbc20090710&gt;{{cite news|last=Hasan|first=Syed Shoaib |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8144772.stm |title=Swat Taliban chief 'near death'|work=BBC News|date=10 July 2009|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a day after the army announced it had wounded the Taliban chief in the Swat valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2009/07/200979172250782249.html|title=Swat valley refugees allowed home |work=Al Jazeera|date=10 July 2009|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Taliban have denied that Fazlullah was critically injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/provinces/12-taliban+reject+claim+about+fazlullah--bi-10 |accessdate=12 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713075010/http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/provinces/12-taliban+reject+claim+about+fazlullah--bi-10 |archivedate=13 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pakistan army, however, refuted this claim and insisted that a man impersonated Fazlullah when he allegedly denied that he was critically injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/print1.asp?id=187399 |accessdate=12 July 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operations from Afghanistan ===
On 29 November 2007, Pakistani security forces captured Fazlullah's headquarters and arrested his brother. Fazlullah himself had already fled to another village. Security Forces have now retaken most of the Swat region. In 2007, Fazullah was allegedly hiding in the [[Konar province]] in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dana Priest|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/mullah-radio-believed-to-be-behind-attack-on-pakistani-schoolgirl/2012/10/17/ee8a9a8c-189f-11e2-9855-71f2b202721b_story.html|title=‘Mullah Radio’ believed to be behind attack on Pakistani schoolgirl|work=The Washington Post|date=29 October 2013|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 January 2008, it was reported that Maulvi Abdul Raziq, a close aide of Fazlullah, was arrested in the Kot area of [[Charbagh, Swat|Charbagh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fazlullah’s aide, other militants held in Swat |newspaper=Dawn |date=26 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5g6ooAYZG?url=http://www.dawn.com/2008/01/26/top8.htm |archivedate=17 April 2009 |url=http://www.dawn.com/2008/01/26/top8.htm |accessdate=19 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 2009, Fazlullah told the BBC's Urdu Service that he had escaped from Pakistan to Afghanistan and warned that he would continue to attack Pakistani forces in Swat.&lt;ref name="bbc20091117"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8364243.stm | title=Taliban leader 'flees Pakistan'|work=BBC News|date=17 November 2009|accessdate=28 June 2012|author=Kakar, Hai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, [[Maj Gen]] [[Athar Abbas]] complained to Reuters that Pakistan had urged Afghanistan and the US to take action against Fazlullah in response to cross-border raids in Dir, Bajaur and Mohmand from April 2011 to August 2011 but that no efforts had been made.  Abbas elaborated, "Fazlullah and his group are trying to re-enter Swat through Dir."&lt;ref name="et20111017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mullah Radio: Pakistan urges Afghan action against Maulvi Fazlullah|date=17 October 2011|work=The Express Tribune News|url= http://tribune.com.pk/story/275813/pakistan-urges-afghan-action-against-taliban-leader/|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 December 2013, it was revealed to the media by [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|TTP]] spokesperson that Fazullah has crossed the Pak-Afghan border into [[Pakistan Tribal Areas|Pakistan's tribal areas]], he was expected to end the squabbling among the Taliban leadership relating to his appointment as new TTP Chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=AFP |url=http://dawn.com/news/1060224/mullah-fazlullah-in-pakistans-tribal-areas-spokesman |title=Mullah Fazlullah in Pakistan's tribal areas: spokesman |publisher=Dawn.Com |date=2013-12-03 |accessdate=2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Saud Mehsud |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/news/international/New_Pakistani_Taliban_chief_comes_home_to_lead_insurgency.html?cid=37459466#topheader |title=New Pakistani Taliban chief comes home to lead insurgency |publisher=swissinfo.ch |date=2013-12-03 |accessdate=2014-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207084250/http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/news/international/New_Pakistani_Taliban_chief_comes_home_to_lead_insurgency.html?cid=37459466#topheader |archive-date=7 December 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tehrik-e-Taliban leadership===
After the death of [[Hakimullah Mehsud]] in a drone attack, Fazlullah was appointed as the new "Emir" (Chief) of the [[Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan]] on 7 November 2013.&lt;ref name=reuters071113&gt;{{cite web|last=Mujtaba |first=Haji |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/07/us-pakistan-taliban-idUSBRE9A60OR20131107 |title=No more peace talks, 'Mullah Radio' tells Pakistan |publisher=Reuters |date=7 November 2013 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ehsanullah Ehsan, the former spokesperson for TTP, Mullah Fazlullah became the leader via lucky draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Army releases former TTP spokesperson Ehsanullah Ehsan’s confessional video|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1393995/ispr-releases-former-ttp-spokesperson-ehsanullah-ehsans-confessional-video/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Army Public School attack in Peshawar===
{{Main|2014 Peshawar school massacre}}

On 16 December 2014, six militants reportedly dressed as Pakistani Army soldiers entered the school through the graveyard situated on the backside of school and killed around 141 people including 132 students and the principal. In reaction to this massacre, Pakistan intensified its ongoing operation [[Operation Zarb-e-Azb|Zarb-e-Azab]] against the militants. Some Pakistani officials claim that Fazlullah masterminded the attack and is hiding on the Afghan side of the [[Durand Line]]. He narrowly escaped a U.S. drone strike on 25 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/796806/precise-drone-strikes-874-killed-in-us-hunt-for-24-terrorists-in-pakistan/|title='Precise' drone strikes: 874 killed in US hunt for 24 terrorists in Pakistan - The Express Tribune|author=|date=25 November 2014|website=tribune.com.pk|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation of Sharia==

===Radio broadcasts===
Fazlullah started an illegal local [[FM broadcasting|FM]] channel in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's [[Swat District|Swat Valley]] in 2006.&lt;ref name=buneri&gt;{{cite news|last=Buneri|first=Shaheen|title=Pakistan Falters Against Taliban in Swat Valley|work=World Politics Review|date=26 January 2009|url=http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/Article.aspx?id=3207|accessdate=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He preaches forcing vice and virtue and has an anti-Western Jihadi stance. He is considered pro-[[Taliban]] and a very powerful figure in the area. He considers most communication based electronics as "major sources of Spreading Jihad" and transmits broadcasts of his sermons on an illegal local FM radio channel, hence the nickname "Radio Mullah" or "Maulana Radio".

FM signals are relayed from mobile transmitters mounted on motorcycles and trucks. During nightly broadcasts, prohibited activities are routinely declared and violators' names announced for assassination, which often includes beheading.&lt;ref name="oppel2009126"&gt;{{cite news

===Introduction of Sharia courts===
With Swat under Fazlullah's control he and his followers quickly moved to set up the Sharia Courts as primary judicial courts instead of when he was running them parallel to the Pakistani National Judicial Courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Anti-polio vaccination stance===
He opposed a [[polio]] vaccination drive in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]] claiming that aid workers were seeking to proselytise in the region, as well as spy for foreign forces. In some sermons he had also considered it against Islamic norms. He considered [[Hepatitis C]] as a more important health issue than polio and questioned the West's intentions. The propaganda had hindered the drive immensely as the local people saw volunteers and workers for the [[World Health Organization]] vaccination program as a threat and in some cases the immunization teams were physically beaten.&lt;ref&gt;

===Opposition to women voting===
In 2001, many seats reserved for women in northern Pakistan went unfilled due in large part to the actions of the TNSM.&lt;ref name="Hussain-Z"&gt;Hussain, Zahid (29 July 2005) [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article549196.ece "Frontier women to defy Islamists' men-only ballot"] ''The Times''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Fazlullah was quoted as saying: ''We have our tradition that bans women from taking part in the elections and violators will be punished.''&lt;ref name="Hussain-Z"/

===Opposition to female education===
A 21 January 2009 issue of the Pakistan daily newspaper ''The News'', reports Taliban enforcement of a complete ban on [[female education]] in the Swat District. Some 400 private schools enrolling 40,000 girls have been shut down. At least 10 girls' schools that tried to open after the 15 January 2009 deadline by the Fazlullah-led Taliban were blown up by the militants in the town of [[Mingora]], the headquarters of the Swat District.&lt;ref&gt;''The News'', Pakistan, 21 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2009}} "More than 170 schools have been bombed or torched, along with other government-owned buildings."&lt;ref&gt;

On 23 March 2015, Pakistani military forces and the Pakistani media reported that Fazlullah was killed on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. This claim was denied by the Tehrik-i-Taliban.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10207">'''GDR-Children of Namibia''' is a colloquial term denoting black [[Namibia]]n children that were raised in [[East Germany]], also known as the German Democratic Republic (GDR). During the [[South African Border War]], the children of hundreds of Namibian refugees and political exiles were resettled and educated in the GDR from 1979 onwards. They were repatriated to Namibia upon that country's formal independence in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Most "GDR-Children" are part of [[Freundeskreis ex-DDR]] (FeD, ''Friends of the former GDR'') &lt;ref&gt;[http://freundeskreisgdr.net Freundeskreis ex-DDR web site]&lt;/ref&gt; organization. The official language of the organization is [[Oshi-Deutsch]], a mixture of [[German Language|German]] and [[Oshivambo]].

==History==
During the South African Border War, SWAPO solicited material assistance from around the globe, which they got in the form of education, health, arms and funds. Between 1960 and 1980 hundreds of Namibians came to GDR and were offered academic education. In 1978 many wounded SWAPO guerrillas came from [[Cassinga]] to GDR for medical treatment. GDR offered „Solidarity Consignment“ to [[South West Africa]]ns. [[Sam Nujoma]] turned again to the GDR and other socialist countries after the Cassinga massacre and asked again for children to be taken out of the SWAPO-Refugee camps for safety, support and for caring for the children.

[[File:Bellin173 DSC0153.JPG|thumb|Bellin castle]]
On 12 September 1979 Sam Nujoma request was granted by [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]]'s [[Central committee]]. Jagdschloss Bellin, a hunting castle in [[Bellin, Germany|Bellin]], a village ten kilometers south of [[Güstrow]] (today in [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]) was identified to be a safety home for the children.

==Arrival==
On 18 December 1979 the first group of about 80 children arrived in the snowy winter in [[Berlin]]. Some were between the ages of 3 to 5 years old. Besides medical and general support it was agreed that German should be the medium of instruction for them in Pre-Primary and Primary School. Between 1979 and 1988 a total of 430 black children came to GDR. Due to inadequate space, the groups of 1979 to 1985 were moved to the ''School of Friendship'' in [[Staßfurt]].

The children were mostly from the cohort of pre-school war orphans. Some of them were selected from families of SWAPO functionaries, reportedly without the consent or consultation of their family members. The government of GDR saw the education of these children as one of their contributions to "World Revolution".&lt;ref name="WAZ"&gt;{{cite news

The first group of children that went in 1979 and were called later the "79er" spent eleven and a half years in the GDR. They went to school and learned German like their mother tongue and basically grew up in a German life of style. German and Namibian teachers tried their level best to sustain the Namibian culture with the teaching of traditional dances, [[Oshivambo]] songs, and traditional food recipes. In the GDR, social and tertiary education was of utmost importance for the children. The education for the SWAPO-[[Pionier (GDR)|Pionier]] aimed at placing most of these youths in elite leadership positions for the development of the country once Namibia achieved its independence.

==Repatriation==
Few months after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in November 1989 Namibia attained its independence. The event culminated in the expulsion of Namibian children and teachers from GDR to Namibia.

There is a number of theories regarding the unexpected repatriation and at that point, an established parent committee requested for the return of these children, as a [[symbol]] for a new Namibian government and to nullify the rumours that the SWAPO-Children were kidnapped. The repatriation of these children took place from 26–31 August 1990 and as home comers they landed in country alien to them. The consequence was cultural shock: Though these youth were seen by the Namibian people as „Germans“ the [[German Namibians|Namibian German]] people regarded them to be „amazingly German“, but still as black people.

For the „GDR-Children of Namibia“ it meant a conflict between two home countries, and between two cultures and a fight for two identities. Many of them returned into poverty and struggle instead of the expected leadership positions.&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{Cite news | title=DDR-Kinder aus Namibia: Das Spiel ihres Lebens |trans-title=GDR Children from Namibia: The play of their life | language=German | last=Pelz | first=Daniel | newspaper=[[Deutsche Welle]] | date=8 June 2016 | url=http://www.dw.com/de/ddr-kinder-aus-namibia-das-spiel-ihres-lebens/a-19311993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In the process of the home coming to Namibia the concept "Ex-GDR-Children" was unintentionally used and the talk of „Ossis of Namibia“, they regarded themselves sometimes as "[[New states of Germany#Culture|Ossi]]". The ''Ossiclub of Windhoek'' that existed up to 2007 was a place where they regularly met, and supported its naming convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2006/1010/media/0040/index.html Ossi-Club und Karnevalsverein, Berliner Zeitung, 10 October 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Until today the concept "GDR-Children" is a meaning that outgrew them a long time. While some of them went to good schools in Namibia and still command the German language barrier in a country with a strong German influence, they stand having good career opportunities. Unfortunately some still go through difficulties of the search for their own home, culture and identity.

Today most of the Ex-GDR-Children describe themselves as "Omulaule", a word in Oshivambo that means "black" or "black Man". Their organization continues to carry the name ''Freundeskreis ex-DDR'', but it is {{As of|2013|alt=currently}} largely dormant.&lt;ref name="WAZ"/&gt;

== Current Situation ==
Since end of 2009 a group of Omulaule came under the spotlight through bad behaviour especially in Windhoek. They started collecting money in the form of donations for an apparent historical expedition from German tourists. Such expedition or project was never planned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.az.com.na/polizei-und-gericht/vor-falschen-spendensammlern-warnen.102187.php Vor falschen Spendensammlern warnen, Allgemeine Zeitung, 16 February 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005233448/http://www.az.com.na/polizei-und-gericht/vor-falschen-spendensammlern-warnen.102187.php |date=5 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.az.com.na/lokales/neue-schau-entpuppt-sich-als-flop.102915.php Neue Schau entpuppt sich als Flop, Allgemeine Zeitung, 1 March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.az.com.na/lokales/hercules-viljoen-geht-auf-distanz.103131.php Hercules Viljoen geht auf Distanz, Allgemeine Zeitung, 4 March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Intim-Tattoo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Tattoo on the [[mons pubis]]]]
'''Genital tattooing''' is the practice of placing permanent marks under the skin of the [[genitals]] in the form of [[tattoo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cltampa.com/dailyloaf/archives/2009/07/15/tattooing-your-genitalia-nsfw-pics#.UUYcgRwe2NA Tattooing your genitalia (NSFW pics)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrence ==
Though tattoos in general have enjoyed an upsurge of popularity, particularly in the west and among younger people, genital tattoos are still relatively rare.  There are several probable reasons for this: the genital area is sensitive, it is not often publicly visible, and sometimes covered with [[pubic hair|hair]].  Also, some tattooists refuse to place tattoos in these (and other) areas for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bme.com/tag/genital-tattoos/ The road to completion is long…]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anatomical locations ==
Nearly the entire genital region can be tattooed, including the shaft and [[glans penis|head]] of the [[human penis|penis]], the skin of the [[scrotum]], the [[pubic region]] and the outer [[labia (genitalia)|labia]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Motivation ==
There are many reasons why a person might choose to have their genitals tattooed.  Often the choice is decorative, and genital tattoo designs have been created to decoratively imitate pubic hair, to enhance the appearance of the genitals, or to create whimsical or other designs around the genital area.  Some men have incorporated genital tattooing into the creation of a tattoo design in such a way that the [[human penis|penis]] becomes a part of the overall design motif (for example, as a "nose" in a tattooed face, or as the "trunk" of an elephant).  Women have created similar designs, incorporating their genitals into tattooed designs like faces and animals.  This practice has long been a part of tattooing, and examples can be seen incorporating the nipples and other parts of the body into designs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/planeta-bizarro/noticia/2012/08/video-que-mostra-jovem-fazendo-tatuagem-anal-vira-hit-na-web.html Vídeo que mostra jovem fazendo tatuagem anal vira hit na web]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some heavily tattooed people choose to have their genital and [[anus|anal]] regions tattooed to complete the work they have over much of their bodies.  Others have used genital tattooing in a [[BDSM]] context, for example to indicate "ownership" of a [[submissive]] by a [[dominant (BDSM)|dominant]].

[[Highway revolts]] in the United States have occurred in cities and regions across the country. In many cities, there remain [[unused highway]]s, abruptly terminating freeway alignments, and short stretches of freeway in the middle of nowhere, all of which are evidence of larger projects which were never completed.  In some instances, freeway revolts have led to the eventual [[freeway removal|removal or relocation of freeways]] that had been built.

In the [[post-World War II economic expansion]], there was a major drive to build a freeway network in the United States, including (but not limited to) the [[Interstate Highway System]]. Design and construction began in earnest in the 1950s, and many cities (as well as rural areas) were subjected to the bulldozer. However, many of the proposed freeway routes were drawn up without considering local interests; in many cases, the construction of the freeway system was considered a regional (or national) issue that trumped local concerns.

Starting in 1956, in San Francisco, when many neighborhood activists became aware of the effect that freeway construction was having on local neighborhoods, effective city opposition to many freeway routes in many cities was raised; this led to the modification or cancellation of many proposed routes. The freeway revolts continued into the 1970s, further enhanced by concern over the [[1970s energy crisis|energy crisis]] and rising fuel costs, as well as a growing [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] movement.  Responding to massive anti-highway protests in Boston,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Sargent]] of Massachusetts ordered a halt to planning and construction of all planned expressways inside the [[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|Route 128]] loop highway, with the exception of the remaining segments of the [[Central Artery]] and the segment of [[Interstate 95]] between East Somerville and the Charles River.  However, some proposals for [[Limited-access road|controlled-access freeways]] have been debated and finalized as a compromise to build them as [[at-grade intersection|at-grade]] expressways.

== Arizona ==

=== Phoenix ===
In [[Phoenix, Arizona]], regional planners had long planned a general belt loop and several freeways crossing the Salt River Valley through much of Phoenix, with the key feature to include a central-city portion of [[Interstate 10]], running just south of [[McDowell Road]]. I-10 had been built westbound to a point southwest of downtown, where it curved and merged into [[Interstate 17]].  The largest unconstructed section of I-10 in the country, beginning just east of the Arizona-California border, was still its planning stage when a debate began for the Phoenix section.  Designers had evolved the proposed [[Papago Freeway]] from a typical surface grade to a massive, elevated structure, rising 100 feet through the central city, with "helicoil" interchanges and a lengthy park under the structure.  Led primarily by influential [[Arizona Republic]] publisher [[Eugene C. Pulliam|Eugene Pulliam]] (grandfather of future Vice President [[Dan Quayle]]), a massive public relations opposition battle began, citing the freeway sprawl of Los Angeles as a model Pulliam did not want Phoenix embracing.  The rhetoric became so heated that in 1973 a non-binding public advisory election was held, resulting (largely due to Pulliam's regular editorial tirades) in an overwhelming "no" vote for the existing plan.  The city and the Arizona State Highway Department (now [[Arizona Department of Transportation]]) scrapped the plans. without further efforts for the central city segment.  As the completed east-bound portion of I-10 advanced closer, transportation planners pushed for some resolution.  By 1984 traffic gridlock had reached the point where planners devised a new plan, with I-10 still running although roughly the same alignment, but instead with the central city portion tunneled through downtown, with a large park on top.  The revised I-10/Papago Freeway was opened in 1990.

== California ==

=== San Francisco ===

In [[San Francisco]], public opposition to [[freeway]]s dates to 1955, when the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' published a map{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} of proposed routes. Construction of the elevated [[Embarcadero Freeway]] along the downtown waterfront also helped to organize the opposition, articulated by architecture critic [[Allan Temko]], who began writing for the ''Chronicle'' in 1961. The 1955 San Francisco Trafficways Plan included the following routes that were never completed:

* A portion of the Mission Freeway was built and still exists as the near-freeway portion of San Jose Avenue from [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]] to Randall Street.  Northeast of that section, it would have run parallel to Mission Street to meet the [[Central Freeway]] above Duboce Avenue.
* The [[Crosstown Freeway (San Francisco)|Crosstown Freeway]] would have run parallel to Bosworth Street and O'Shaughnessy Boulevard (and through [[Glen Canyon Park]]) from [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]] to the Western Freeway near 7th Avenue.  Most of the right of way for this freeway was cleared but it was never built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=San Francisco's Glen Park and Diamond Heights |first=Emma Bland |last=Smith |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |date=2007 |page=83 |isbn=9780738547510 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9tbetmxz0AC&amp;pg=PA83 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Western Freeway would have run north from [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]] along the line of Junipero Serra Boulevard, then tunnelling to 7th Avenue to meet the [[Crosstown Freeway]].  It would have then continued north to the southern edge of [[Golden Gate Park]] and followed an unspecified route (in the 1951 version, a tunnel under the park and then a depressed routing through the Panhandle) northeast to the eastern end of the Panhandle, continuing east from there between Fell and Oak Streets to meet the [[Central Freeway]].
* A portion of the [[Park Presidio Freeway]] was built as and still exists as [[SR 1 (CA)]] through the Presidio from the [[Golden Gate Bridge]].  South of that section the freeway would have continued, replacing what is now Park Presidio Boulevard, and then tunneled under [[Golden Gate Park]] to meet the Western Freeway.
* A portion of the [[Central Freeway]] was built and the original section west from the [[Bayshore Freeway]] to Mission Street still exists as [[US 101]].  The section northwest from Mission to Market Street was reconstructed in 2004.  The section north of Market Street to Golden Gate Avenue was demolished and not rebuilt.  The remaining distance to the [[Golden Gate Freeway]] was never built.
* A portion of the [[Embarcadero Freeway]] was built from the Bay Bridge approach to Broadway as [[California State Route 480|Interstate 480]].  The section north of Broadway to the [[Golden Gate Freeway]] was never built.  The entire freeway was removed after the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]].
* Most of the [[Southern Embarcadero Freeway]] was built and still exists as part of [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]], but the section from Third Street to the Bay Bridge approach was never built.  The section between Sixth and Third Streets was removed after the Loma Prieta earthquake.
* The [[Golden Gate Freeway]] along the northern edge of the city from the [[Embarcadero Freeway]] to the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] approach was never built.
* The freeway approach from [[US 101]] and [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]] to the [[Southern Crossing (California)|Southern Crossing bridge]] was never built because the bridge was not built.

The 1960 Trafficways Plan deleted several of these routes but added another:

* The [[Hunters Point Freeway]] would have run from [[US 101]] south of the city limits on landfill around [[Candlestick Point]] and across [[Hunters Point, San Francisco, California|Hunters Point]] to meet [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]] near what is now Cesar Chavez Street.

In 1959, the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] voted to cancel seven of ten planned freeways, including an extension of the [[Central Freeway]]. In 1964, protests against a freeway through the [[Panhandle (San Francisco)|Panhandle]] and [[Golden Gate Park]] led to its cancellation, and in 1966 the Board of Supervisors rejected an extension of the Embarcadero Freeway to the [[Golden Gate Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to the Embarcadero Freeway continued, and in 1985, the Board of Supervisors voted to demolish it. It was closed after sustaining heavy damage in 1989's [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] and torn down shortly thereafter. The entire portion of the [[Central Freeway]] north of [[Market Street, San Francisco, California|Market Street]] was demolished over the next decade:  the top deck in 1996, and the lower deck in 2003.  Two other short freeway segments were demolished in the same time period:  the Terminal Separator Structure near [[Rincon Hill]] and the Embarcadero Freeway, and the stub end of [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]] near [[Mission Bay, San Francisco, California|Mission Bay]].

=== Oakland ===
In [[Oakland, California]], the Richmond Boulevard Freeway would have run along Valdez Street, Richmond Boulevard, Glen Echo Creek, and Moraga Avenue from 20th Street to [[California State Route 13|SR 13]].  It was approved by Oakland voters in a 1945 bond issue, but was canceled August 16, 1956, when the city of [[Piedmont, California|Piedmont]] was unable to pay for its portion of the route.&lt;ref&gt;"Plans for Freeway to be Dropped," Oakland Tribune, August 17, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, the Richmond Boulevard Protective Association had protested the route and its planned destruction of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;"Richmond Group Attacks Plan for Extending Freeway," Oakland Tribune, July 5, 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Berkeley ===
In [[Berkeley, California]], the Ashby Freeway would have run approximately along the line of Ashby Avenue from [[Interstate 80]] to [[California State Route 24]].  The Berkeley Department of Public Works and Planning Commission proposed possible routings for it in 1952, and were met with 5,000 signatures on a petition in opposition.  Nevertheless, the commission included the route in the 1955 Berkeley Master Plan.  A 1957 public hearing drew 100 protesters.  The 1959 Alameda County transportation plan attempted to relocate the proposed freeway to the Oakland-Berkeley border, but Oakland was no more receptive to the freeway, and the Berkeley City Council voted to stop planning it in 1961.

=== Bakersfield ===

In [[Bakersfield, California]], the [[California State Route 178|SR 178]] freeway terminates two miles east of the [[California State Route 99|SR 99]] freeway.  The section through downtown Bakersfield and the Westchester residential district was never completed due to opposition from Westchester residents.  The controversy continues to this day, as the Bakersfield City Council's plans to widen Highway 178 through the Westchester area are being strongly protested.

=== Los Angeles ===
*The [[Laurel Canyon Freeway]] ([[California State Route 170|SR 170]]) would have been aligned through western [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]], the [[Mid-City West]] area, and western [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] en route to its terminus at the [[Interstate 405 (California)|San Diego Freeway]] ([[Interstate 405 (California)|I-405]]) near [[Los Angeles International Airport]].  It was scrapped in the face of community opposition from these districts and its namesake [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, California|Laurel Canyon]].  Only the portion traversing the [[Baldwin Hills (mountain range)|Baldwin Hills]] was finished, later being designated as [[La Cienega Boulevard]].
*The [[Beverly Hills Freeway]] ([[California State Route 2|SR 2]]) would have run from the [[Hollywood Freeway]] ([[U.S. Route 101 (California)|US 101]]) in southern [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] to the San Diego Freeway (I-405) in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood]] along the alignment of Melrose Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard.  It went through several proposed iterations—including a [[cut-and-cover]] tunnel—before its mid-1970s abandonment in the face of opposition from residents of [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], the [[Fairfax District, Los Angeles, California|Fairfax District]], and [[Hancock Park, Los Angeles, California|Hancock Park]].  Caltrans acquired and cleared the land needed for the freeway in the city of Beverly Hills; the right-of-way later became a [[Beverly Gardens Park|long greenway]].
*The Slauson Freeway ([[California State Route 90|SR 90]]), originally known as the [[Richard M. Nixon]] Freeway and intended to run across southern [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]] and northern [[Orange County, California|Orange]] counties between the Pacific Coast Highway ([[California State Route 1|SR 1]]) and [[Riverside Freeway|Riverside]] ([[California State Route 91|SR 91]]), was truncated as a result of opposition to its construction through [[South Central Los Angeles]].  The only portions completed to freeway level are the short [[Marina Freeway]] that runs between [[Marina del Rey, California|Marina del Rey]] and southern [[Culver City, California|Culver City]] and the Richard M. Nixon Parkway in [[Yorba Linda, California|Yorba Linda]].
*The [[Glendale Freeway]] ([[California State Route 2|SR 2]]) terminates roughly {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} northeast of its intended terminus at the Hollywood Freeway (US 101), due to opposition from residents of [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]].
*The Pacific Coast Freeway ([[California State Route 1|SR 1]]) would have upgraded the existing Pacific Coast Highway to freeway standards.  Opposition by residents of [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], and the coastal cities of the [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]] region led to the project's abandonment. One segment, between Oxnard and the Point Mugu Naval Air Station, was built in the 1960s before the project was abandoned.
*The Redondo Beach Freeway ([[California State Route 91|SR 91]]) would have linked the Pacific Coast Freeway in [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] or the San Diego Freeway (I-405) in [[Torrance, California|Torrance]] to the [[Long Beach Freeway]] ([[Interstate 710 (California)|I-710]]).  Opposition by Redondo Beach and Torrance led to its truncation to its current terminus at the [[Harbor Freeway]] (I-110) in [[Gardena, California|Gardena]]; the California legislature subsequently renamed it the [[Gardena Freeway]].
*The [[Century Freeway]] (I-105), itself the subject of an unsuccessful freeway revolt in [[Hawthorne, California|Hawthorne]], [[South Central Los Angeles]], [[Lynwood, California|Lynwood]], and [[Downey, California|Downey]] that lasted nearly two decades, was truncated at the [[San Gabriel River Freeway]] ([[Interstate 605 (California)|I-605]]) instead of its intended terminus at the [[Santa Ana Freeway]] ([[Interstate 5 (California)|I-5]]) due to opposition from the city of [[Norwalk, California|Norwalk]].  One of the compromises allowing the freeway to be built caused the inclusion of a mass transit line in the freeway median.  This is the [[LACMTA Green Line]], which opened August 12, 1995. The Glenn Anderson Freeway opened October 15, 1993.
*The [[Long Beach Freeway]] ([[Interstate 710 (California)|I-710]]) was originally intended to go from the port complex all the way north to Pasadena, linking up with the Ventura and Foothill Freeways (SR 134 &amp; I-210), completing a bypass of Downtown Los Angeles to the east.  The freeway was completed to just past I-10 in Alhambra, and a half-mile stub was built in Pasadena (still unsigned, but officially SR 710).  Opposition came from the small city of South Pasadena which would have been cut in half, impacting its small but lively downtown.  A six-mile (10&amp;nbsp;km) gap currently exists and Caltrans is still attempting to build some sort of link, the latest idea of which has been a pair of tunnels.
**Opposition to the building of the 710 extension through South Pasadena has, for some 30 years, resulted in the suspension of plans to build an extension from the [[Interstate 210 (California)|210 freeway]] through West Pasadena and South Pasadena.  The ramps exist and a stub is in place at [[California Avenue]], but much of the land taken for the freeway has been resold by [[Caltrans]] to private parties.  In 2006, the idea of completing the freeway by means of an underground [[tunnel]] was first proposed.  This idea is currently under a funded study by the [[LACMTA]].{{Update|sentence|date=November 2015}}
**A proposed rehabilitation and widening of the aged [[Long Beach Freeway]] ([[Interstate 710 (California)|I-710]]) between the [[Pomona Freeway|Pomona]] ([[California State Route 60|SR 60]]) and San Diego (I-405) freeways, which would have removed over 2000 residences in five cities and one unincorporated area, generated such opposition that [[Caltrans]] and the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) abandoned it within days of its unveiling in 2004.  Caltrans and MTA have issued a new plan that would use MTA-owned utility right-of-way along the [[Los Angeles River]] and require the taking of fewer than ten residences.
*During the 1980s, [[Caltrans]] proposed extending the [[Orange Freeway]] ([[California State Route 57|SR 57]]) from its terminus at the [[Orange Crush interchange|"Orange Crush" interchange]] to the San Diego Freeway (I-405) by means of an elevated alignment along the bed of the [[Santa Ana River]].  Pressure from environmental groups led Caltrans and the [[Orange County Transportation Authority]] to abandon the plan.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
*The portion of the [[Foothill Freeway]] ([[Interstate 210 (California)|I-210]]) running through the [[Crescenta Valley]] was not completed until the early 1980s, largely due to opposition by the wealthy city of [[La Cañada Flintridge, California|La Cañada Flintridge]].  As part of the legal settlement allowing for the freeway's construction, it was built so far below grade that two creeks crossing its alignment traverse the freeway by means of aqueducts.

=== Orange County ===
In Southern California, a number of environmental organizations including the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], the [[Sierra Club]], the [[Surfrider Foundation]] and others, along with the California State Parks Foundation, banded together to stop a planned extension to the [[California State Route 241|SR 241 Foothill South Toll Road]].  The groups contend that the project threatens the fragile San Mateo Creek Watershed and would result in the loss of a significant portion of the popular [[San Onofre State Beach]] Park. In 2006, the coalition filed a lawsuit against the [[Transportation Corridor Agencies|Transportation Corridor Agency]] – the agency responsible for the project – stating that deficiencies in the project's environmental impact report violated the [[California Environmental Quality Act]].  The groups were joined in the lawsuit by the California State Attorney General's Office.

=== San Diego ===
[[California State Route 252|State Route 252]] was intended to connect [[Interstate 5 (California)|Interstate 5]] to [[Interstate 805 (California)|Interstate 805]].  Ramps were constructed on I-805 at 43rd Street before the project was canceled in 1994 due to neighborhood opposition.  The new freeway would have occupied a swath of land dividing [[Barrio Logan]].  Much of the land intended for freeway construction is still unoccupied.  The interchange ramps from I-805 now end in a shopping mall parking lot.

===San Luis Obispo===
Cuesta Freeway was intended to connect [[California State Route 101|SR 101]] in San Luis Obispo with an interchange at Marsh Street exit to [[Cuesta College]]. This proposed section was post to be the new route for [[California State Route 1|SR 1]]. The new route was adopted in 1965 by Caltrans and would cost more than $2 million a mile for the 7.1 mile expansion. The plan for the new route was rejected by major opposition from the community at the October 11, 1971, San Luis Obispo city council meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Colorado==

=== Denver ===
During the 60s, there were a number of proposals for new expressways.  These included the Skyline Freeway from Commerce City to Morrison, the Hampden Freeway through Englewood, the Columbine Freeway which would have gone up Santa Fe, Downing, and Park Avenue West before leaving Denver via North Pecos Street, the Mountain Freeway which would have replaced all of Alameda, and The Quebec Freeway from I-70 all the way to I-25.

There was opposition to a planned beltway around Denver, which was to be signed as Interstate 470. Eventually, a compromise was reached, and the beltway was built, using three different designations: [[Colorado State Highway 470|State Highway 470]], [[E-470]] and the [[Northwest Parkway]]. Currently, a gap remains in the beltway, as it stops short of reaching the Denver suburbs of Broomfield and Golden, where fierce opposition to the road continues. Golden is opposed to completion of the beltway; Broomfield supports it, and has been exploring alternate routes.

== Connecticut ==

=== Hartford ===
In 1973 environmentalists filed lawsuits that effectively killed construction of the planned [[Interstate 291 (Connecticut)|Interstate 291]] beltway west of [[Interstate 91]], the proposed [[Interstate 484]] expressway through the downtown, and the proposed [[Interstate 284]] expressway between [[East Hartford]] and [[South Windsor, Connecticut|South Windsor]], and [[Interstate 491]] from [[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]] to [[Manchester, Connecticut|Manchester]].  After these freeways were cancelled, the State of Connecticut used the funds allocated for their construction to rebuild and expand existing freeways in the Greater Hartford area.  In 1992 the [[Route 9 (Connecticut)|Route 9]] Expressway was extended north from I-91 in New Britain to [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]] in Farmington, completing what would have been the southwest quadrant of the I-291 beltway; the northwest quadrant of the canceled beltway is partially served by the 4-lane arterial [[Route 218 (Connecticut)|Route 218]] west of I-91 (Route 218 does not connect to I-84 or Route 9, leaving an approximately 7 mile gap in the northwest quadrant between I-84/Route 9 and Route 218).  The [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]] eventually built its current headquarters on land originally acquired for I-291, where it was to intersect US-5 in Newington.

=== Eastern Connecticut ===
Interstate 84 was originally planned to continue on an easterly course to [[Providence, Rhode Island]], closely following [[U.S. Route 6|US 6]] through Tolland and Windham counties.  Environmental concerns in Connecticut and Rhode Island led to the cancellation of this extension, and I-84 was shifted to the existing [[Wilbur Cross Highway]] (which had been designated [[Interstate 86 (Connecticut-Massachusetts)|I-86]]; this number has since reappeared on [[Interstate 86 (east)|a partially completed expressway]] in northern [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Upstate New York]]) between Hartford and [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts]] in 1983. The already-completed portions of this extension was redesignated as [[Interstate 384]] and [[US-6]] Windham Bypass.  CONNDOT and the FHWA intended to construct the US-6 Freeway through Andover, Bolton, and Coventry to link I-384 and the Windham Bypass. After 40 years since it was first planned, CONNDOT, the FHWA, and local officials remained deadlocked with the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers over the routing of the US-6 Freeway.  Since the agencies involved could not come to an agreement, CONNDOT abandoned plans the US-6 Freeway in 2005.  The department instead rebuilt the section of US-6 the freeway was intended to bypass in 2000.  The section of US-6 between I-384 and Willimantic remains a two-lane road, but rebuilding that segment straightened curves, added shoulders and turning pockets, and reduced the number of roadways and driveways intersecting the road to improve safety.

===Fairfield County===
Local opposition, particularly in the town of [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]], convinced a federal judge to halt construction of the [[U.S. Route 7]] Expressway (originally envisioned to be a segment of the then-proposed Interstate 89 through western New England) between [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] in 1972.  State and federal highway officials subsequently prepared an [[environmental impact statement]] for the expressway, and a Federal judge allowed construction to resume in 1983.  By then however, the cost of construction had skyrocketed and there were no longer any funds available to complete the expressway, as all highway funds were diverted into a massive statewide highway repair program in the wake of the [[Mianus River Bridge]] collapse months earlier.  Two short extensions of the Route 7 freeway were completed near the Danbury Fair Mall in 1986, and from Route 123 to Gristmill Road in Norwalk in 1992, before funds for further construction were exhausted.  The proposal remained on the books until the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|CONNDOT]] canceled expressway plans in 1999 in lieu of widening the existing Route 7 to 4 lanes, citing a lack of funding and no feasible route that would avoid the environmentally sensitive [[Norwalk River]] basin. Some in Connecticut have been seeking to revive the expressway proposal, including those who originally opposed it, citing the rapidly increasing volume of traffic and the number of fatal accidents on the existing Route 7 over the past 20 years. Further north on US-7 however, officials in [[Brookfield, Connecticut|Brookfield]] have long pushed CONNDOT to construct a new US-7 freeway to the west of Brookfield.  After decades of environmental studies and intense debate, construction on the Brookfield Bypass began in 2007 and opened in 2009.

Similarly, CONNDOT planned to construct a new freeway for [[Route 25 (Connecticut)|Route 25]] between [[Connecticut Turnpike|I-95]] in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] and [[Interstate 84 (east)|I-84]] in [[Newtown, Connecticut|Newtown]].  Construction began on the Route 25 freeway in 1968, and the existing portion between I-95 and [[Route 111 (Connecticut)|Route 111]] in [[Trumbull, Connecticut|Trumbull]] opened in 1975.  Opposition from environmental groups and residents in the towns of [[Monroe, Connecticut|Monroe]] and Newtown forced CONNDOT to eventually kill plans for extending the Route 25 freeway north of Route 111 in 1992.  The department has instead focused on widening the existing 2-lane roadway, which is supported by Trumbull and Monroe.  However, Newtown remains opposed to any upgrades that would change the existing 2-lane profile of Route 25 through its town.

Since its opening in 1940, the Connecticut Department of Transportation has floated various plans to widen the [[Merritt Parkway]], all of which have been thwarted by the efforts of conservationists who oppose the destruction of the Parkway's uniquely designed bridges and rustic character.

===New Haven===
The [[Connecticut Route 34|Oak Street Connector]] was a proposed east-west freeway originally envisioned to connect New Haven with [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], largely paralleling Route 34.  Construction on the initial (and only completed) segment in downtown New Haven from Interstate 95 to York Street began in 1957, with its opening in 1959. Opposition to the freeway in New Haven increased as homes and businesses between York Street and Route 10 were razed to extend the Route 34 freeway, resulting in lawsuits that halted further construction on the highway in the late 1960s and 1970s.  Further west, residents in the town of Orange opposed the Route 34 freeway as it would pass near a reservoir that supplies the region with its drinking water.  Opponents further west along Route 34 in Monroe and Oxford filed lawsuits to block construction of a bridge across the [[Housatonic River]] to bypass the existing crossing at [[Stevenson Dam]], fearing the new crossing would cause irreparable damage to Bald Eagle nesting sites and increase truck traffic through both towns.

Two other small sections of the planned Route 34 freeway were completed:  a short freeway stub from Route 34 to a directional interchange with Interstate 84 in Newtown (originally built for the cancelled Route 25 freeway extension) built in the mid-1970s, and a short freeway segment near the Maltby Lakes in Orange that was completed in the 1980s but never put into service.  The completed section in Orange is now used as a commuter parking lot. The State of Connecticut sold off land originally cleared for the Route 34 freeway between York Street and Route 10 in New Haven in 2002, effectively ensuring the freeway could not be extended beyond York Street.  Meanwhile, officials and community groups in New Haven began pressing the State of Connecticut to remove the existing freeway through downtown.  In 2011, the city of New Haven and State of Connecticut reached an agreement to remove the Route 34 freeway west of the New Haven Railyard and construct a 4-lane landscaped boulevard in its place.  A portion of the land recovered from the freeway would be sold for development, while the remainder reserved as park space.  Demolition of the Route 34 freeway began in 2013, with completion scheduled for 2016.  Similarly, the Connecticut Department of Transportation plans to remove the freeway stub at I-84 in Newtown and replace the directional interchange with a diamond interchange.  ConnDOT also plans to build a [[rest area]] in the location of the current freeway stub once its removal is complete.

{{See also|Canceled expressways in Florida}}

=== South Florida ===
In the 1970s, most of [[South Florida]]'s expressways were canceled due to voters choosing to direct funding away from roads toward mass transit projects and the planned [[Metrorail (Miami)|Miami Metrorail]].  [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]] in particular is anti-expressway, as many proposals for expressways in the city have been canceled due to community opposition.

*Cypress Creek Expressway: The Cypress Creek Expressway would have been an east–west expressway run along the present day Cypress Creek Road, serving [[Pompano Beach]], [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[North Lauderdale]], and [[Tamarac, Florida|Tamarac]].  The Cypress Creek Expressway would have begun at [[A1A]] at the Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach border, and run along what is presently the eastern disjointed section of McNab Road.  West of [[Old Dixie Highway]], the road would have dipped south and run along present-day Cypress Creek Road (west of [[Florida's Turnpike]] it connects with the western disjointed section of McNab Road), until terminating at the proposed University-Deerfield Expressway (now the [[Florida State Road 869|Sawgrass Expressway]]). There was no projected interchange with the Florida's Turnpike.  It was to be four lanes for its entire length, and its total cost was slated at $22.6 million.  It was never built due to funding and opposition.
*[[Dolphin Expressway]] Airport Spur: The Dolphin Expressway was originally supposed to be built on Northwest 20th Street, instead of its current 14th Street alignment.  A 1964 plan called for two options to solving the traffic problems near Miami International Airport.  The first option was to convert [[LeJeune Road]] into an 8-lane expressway between the Dolphin Expressway and the [[Airport Expressway (Miami)|Airport Expressway]].  The second option was to build a spur route from the Dolphin Expressway that would connect to the entrance of [[Miami International Airport]], thus relieving LeJeune Road.  The spur would branch off the Tollway just east of NW 37th Avenue and run north–south on the west side of NW 37th Avenue. North of Melreese Golf Course, it would cross the Tamiami Canal and head west to the MIA terminal entrance on Northwest 21st Street.  A [[stack interchange]] was built at LeJeune Rd and 21st Street and is used today between the two streets and the airport, as opposed as the originally planned expressway interchange.
*[[Gratigny Parkway]]: The Gratigny Parkway of today is much shorter than the original planned length.  The original western end was supposed to be the [[Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike]]. The eastern terminus was supposed to be [[Florida State Road 922|SR 922]], or it would have merged with the SR 922 and taking over its causeway.  The portion east of 32nd Avenue was never completed due to community opposition.  The original western terminus at the Turnpike was moved back to the [[Palmetto Expressway]] because of new plans to extend I-75 south to Miami from [[Fort Lauderdale]] and keep I-595 as an independent expressway.  The Gratigny continues to the west as I-75 and curves northbound at 138th Street/Hialeah Gardens Drive.  An extension to the Turnpike in the west is in MDX's 2025 master plan, that would reduce the length of I-75.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
*[[Hialeah Expressway]]: The Hialeah Expressway would have been a third east–west route across Dade County, cutting through Hialeah, the second most populated city in Dade County.  Its eastern terminus would have been [[Alton Road]] and 47th Street in [[Miami Beach]], crossing Biscayne Bay over the planned Beach Causeway.  It would then cross the proposed Interama Expressway and I-95, and run along a path between NW 79th and 62nd Street.  Upon crossing Okeechobee Road ([[U.S. Route 27 in Florida|U.S. Route 27]]), it would parallel NW 74th Street until reaching the [[West Dade Expressway]], now the Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike, for a distance of {{convert|16|mi|km}}.  Despite its cancellation, Northwest 74th Street was partially converted into an expressway.
*Interama Expressway: The Interama Expressway, also known as the Midbay Causeway was supposed to be a north–south expressway in eastern Dade County as an alternative route and reliever to [[Biscayne Boulevard]] ([[U.S. Route 1 in Florida|U.S. Route 1]]).  It would have run from an intersection at I-95 and the proposed Snake Creek Expressway (originally proposed to run across [[Florida State Road 858|State Road 858]]), paralleled US 1 from there to an intersection with proposed South Dixie Expressway (see below) and I-95, slicing through downtown Miami along the way.
*LeJeune-Douglas Expressway: The expressway was to run from US 1 in [[Coral Gables]] to the [[Palmetto Expressway]] in [[Carol City]]/[[Miami Gardens]] as a reliever to traffic between the Palmetto Expressway and [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]] on a [[LeJeune Road]]-Douglas Road corridor, passing directly by [[Miami International Airport]].
*Rock Island Expressway: This would have been a north-south expressway built on Rock Island Road having its southern terminus at the Turnpike near Northwest 44th Street in [[Tamarac, Florida|Tamarac]]. The north terminus was most likely either Wiles Road or the University-Deerfield Expressway (now the Sawgrass Expressway) in [[Coral Springs, Florida|Coral Springs]].
*Sheridan Expressway: The Sheridan Expressway was planned to upgrade [[Florida State Road 822|State Road 822]], locally known as Sheridan Street into an expressway.  It would run from Old Dixie Highway in downtown Hollywood to the also canceled University-Deerfield Expressway in [[Cooper City]] (now [[Florida State Road 817|University Drive]]).
*South Dixie Expressway/I-95 Extension: This would have extended I-95 south of its terminus at US 1 near downtown [[Miami]] to [[Florida City, Florida|Florida City]], using an upgraded US 1 route.  The southernmost ten miles of the [[Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike]] was part of the proposed I-95 extension.&lt;ref&gt;"I-75 Extension Should Kill Toll Road – Cramer".  Daytona Beach Morning Journal.  August 16, 1968: 16&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sawgrass Expressway|University-Deerfield Expressway]]: When it was first proposed in 1969, it was supposed to be the northernmost part of a chain of expressways from Deerfield Beach to Coral Gables, but the proposed Snake Creek Expressway (in Broward County) became part of the Florida's Turnpike Extension and the LeJeune-Douglas Expressway (in Dade County) failed in the 1970s as construction budgets narrowed roadbuilding capabilities.  On the other hand, the rerouting of Interstate 75 from the Tamiami Trail to Alligator Alley increased the necessity of a northern/western bypass of coastal Broward County and invigorated the project which had acquired a new route and a new name, the Sawgrass-Deerfield Expressway, later shortened to the Sawgrass Expressway.
*There were two expressways proposed in [[Palm Beach County]]: A northern extension of the [[Sawgrass Expressway]] to be called University Parkway would have snaked around western suburbs of [[Boca Raton]], [[Delray Beach]], and [[Boynton Beach, Florida|Boynton Beach]]. Its path would have bordered the [[Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge]], turning east and terminating at Flavor Pict Road west of Boynton Beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1993-09-28/news/9309280170_1_four-lane-parkway-powerline-task-force|title=University Parkway Takes A Drubbing|work=Sun Sentinel|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1993-09-14/news/9309140116_1_task-force-palm-beach-county-broward-county|title=Task Force Divided By Inter-county Road Proposal|work=Sun Sentinel|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other expressway was to run east-west, connecting downtown [[West Palm Beach]] with the western communities of [[Wellington, Florida|Wellington]], [[Royal Palm Beach]], and [[The Acreage, Florida|The Acreage]]. There were two proposed corridors: the first (and most desired by county commissioners) ran between Belvedere Road and [[Florida State Road 704|Okeechobee Boulevard]], displacing several homes and churches along its path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-10-16/news/8603020944_1_authority-members-routes-sansbury|title=Concerns Aired Over Road Plan Westgate Seeks Delay On Decision|work=Sun Sentinel|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-07-22/news/8703010530_1_expressway-authority-members-marcus|title=Authority Returns To Controversial Route For Expressway Plans|work=Sun Sentinel|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second proposed corridor ran north of Okeechobee Boulevard and aligned with Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-02-18/news/8701100952_1_expressway-route-authority-members|title=Authority Drops Expressway Proposal|work=Sun Sentinel|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When community opposition to the aforementioned routes escalated, county officials offered to transform [[Florida State Road 80|Southern Boulevard]] into a full expressway to avoid displacing any residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-01-21/news/8701050057_1_expressway-toll-road-southern-boulevard|title=Highway Review Urged Engineer Revives Expressway Plan|work=Sun Sentinel|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All proposed expressways were eventually scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-03-10/news/8801150162_1_expressway-authority-members-authority-meeting|title=Authority Offers To Drop Tollway Plans|work=Sun Sentinel|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than a decade after shelving those expressway plans, Southern Boulevard was converted into a partial east–west expressway from I-95 to [[Florida State Road 7|SR 7]].

=== Tampa Bay area ===
In the 1970s, there were plans for several freeways in the [[Tampa Bay area]], but most were canceled by 1982.  The high cost of acquiring right of way in this densely populated area, as well as community opposition, were the key factors in canceling most of these freeways.  Instead, planners decided to widen existing roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.bayciti.net/hrd/cncld/cncld.htm |title=Hillsborough's Cancelled Freeways |publisher= |accessdate=October 6, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406050102/http://www.bayciti.net/hrd/cncld/cncld.htm |archivedate=April 6, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Belcher Freeway: {{convert|10.6|mi|km}}. This freeway is a casualty of the high cost of acquiring the wide girth of land needed to build it.  [[U.S. Route 19 (Florida)|U.S. Route 19]] had traffic backups as far back as 1965, and the Belcher Freeway was considered in a Greiner Inc., study that year. While public reception was positive, the freeway was canceled in May 1978 as traffic projections without that link would have not made it cost effective or useful to construct. To compensate, [[U.S. Route 19 (Florida)|U.S. Route 19]] was upgraded to a freeway in the area.
*Brandon Bypass: This expressway would have served as an alternative bypass route to [[Florida State Road 60|State Road 60]] in [[Brandon, Florida|Brandon]].  It would have connected at the eastern end of the Southern Crosstown Expressway, passing to the south of Brandon, ending at an interchange with State Road 60 east of Brandon.  By 1984 when city planners were ready to build the expressway, the area's population exploded, with high land prices and community opposition leading to its cancellation and instead widening of State Road 60 in Brandon.
*Clearwater North Freeway: {{convert|4|mi|km}}. This proposed freeway would have connected downtown [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]] with US 19 and points north, and it never made it to design or planning.
*[[Dale Mabry Highway]] upgrade: Dale Mabry Highway was planned to be upgraded to an expressway north of the canceled Northtown Expressway to near Lutz.  The upgrades were only applied to a couple of intersections due to community oppositions on most of the road.
*[[Florida State Road 694A|State Road 694A]]: {{convert|3.6|mi|km}}. This freeway would have run from 137th St to [[Florida State Road 595|SR 595]] and connected the proposed east-west Gandy Freeway directly with the beaches.  It was canceled by 1972, and never brought to public attention.
*Gandy Freeway: {{convert|12.6|mi|km}}. The Gandy Freeway would have connected with the proposed connection to the [[Lee Roy Selmon Expressway]] in Tampa, and provided a route due west to the beaches in [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas County]] on an upgraded [[Florida State Road 694|Gandy Boulevard]].  The low likelihood of the Hillsborough County portion being constructed, and of increasing urbanization of [[Pinellas Park, Florida|Pinellas Park]] led to this freeway's cancellation in 1979.  Remains of this freeway can be seen in the Gandy Boulevard interchange at [[Interstate 275 (Florida)|I-275]], the separated grade diamond interchange at [[U.S. Route 19 in Florida|US 19]] with Gandy Blvd as limited access, and of the very wide right-of-way preserved along Gandy Boulevard east of I-275.  While the original plans are dead, the intersections of Gandy Blvd with 4th, 9th and 16th Streets and Roosevelt Blvd were flown in 2017; traffic in both directions is now unencumbered by signals from just east of I-275 all the way to the dog track.
*Hillsborough Bay Causeway: The freeway would have started near [[MacDill Air Force Base]], heading southeast, crossing Tampa Bay to the [[U.S. Route 41 in Florida|U.S. 41]] corridor in southern Hillsborough County, also doubling as a barrier against hurricanes for Tampa.  It was canceled due to lack of growth in southern Hillsborough County and the fact that shipping would have been blocked by the bridge.
*[[Northwest Hillsborough Expressway]]: In the 1970s, an expressway crossing through northern [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]] was proposed, but by the 1980s many of these communities (especially [[Lutz, Florida|Lutz]]) opposed the road going through their towns.  Eventually, the project was broken into two sections, [[Florida State Road 589|Veterans Expressway]] which has since been built and the Lutz Freeway, now known as the East-West Road, which continues to create controversy in local politics.
*Pinellas Belt Expressway: {{convert|7.4|mi|km}}. The Pinellas Belt Expressway, or beltway, was budgeted in 1974 for construction in the 1979 fiscal year but intense community opposition stopped the freeway from progressing.  Construction would have disrupted retail outlets along Tyrone Blvd and [[U.S. Route 19 Alternate (St. Petersburg, Florida)|US 19 Alt]], and right-of-way acquisition would have been too expensive because of the neighborhoods it would have traversed. The full freeway interchange at US 19 Alt and [[Florida State Road 666|SR 666]] in [[Seminole, Florida|Seminole]] is all that remains of this Belt Expressway.
*[[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]]-[[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]] Expressway: {{convert|20.2|mi|km}}. This freeway was the highest profile of all planned in the county, and would have been built as an interstate with mostly federal funds.  It would have provided a route directly from downtown St. Petersburg to downtown Clearwater and would have replaced much of US 19 through the [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas County]].  Land acquisition would have been easy as most of the route was railroad right-of-way.  The freeway was officially canceled on May 12, 1978, because new federal guidelines for interstates indicated that any approved route going forward would have to be {{convert|10|mi|km}} or less in length, and be a 'final link' in the interstate system as a whole, instead of a new road.  Attention after that cancellation began to turn towards upgrading US 19 instead.  The former railroad line is used as a bike–pedestrian trail, known as the [[Pinellas Trail]].
*South Hillsborough Parkway: Planned as early as 1972 to anticipate growth along the [[U.S. Route 41 in Florida|U.S. Route 41]] corridor, the road was to relieve traffic from somewhere in southern Hillsborough County north to the current [[Interstate 4]].  However, the local swampy landscape didn't allow for much growth and [[Interstate 75 in Florida|I-75]]'s presence served as a reliever in U.S. Route 41's place, canceling the parkway by 1987.
*State Road 60 Freeway Upgrade: {{convert|6|mi|km}}. [[Florida State Road 60|SR 60]] is a busy, retail-loaded east/west route in Clearwater.  Legions of tourists from the north and east use it as their primary route to Clearwater Beach and due to its high traffic, it was proposed to be upgraded to a freeway.  Local merchants and residents were against this upgrade, and instead SR 60 instead was widened, and an arterial bypass of downtown Clearwater was constructed.  The freeway was dropped from records in May 1975.
*Sunset Point Freeway: {{convert|7.2|mi|km}}. The Sunset Point Freeway was never seriously considered, with the upgrading of SR 60 to a freeway being favored at the time, although traffic studies in the early 1970s indicated that Drew Street, a major east-west road in downtown Clearwater, would need a reliever freeway route by 1990.  The Sunset Point freeway never made it to the design or planning stage.
*[[Tampa Bay Crosstown Expressway System]]: This was a system of expressways proposed to span the entire Tampa Bay area, but most of it was eventually canceled.  The [[Lee Roy Selmon Expressway]] is the successor of the South Crosstown Expressway.
*Ulmerton Expressway: {{convert|8|mi|km}}. The Ulmerton Expressway would have upgraded [[Florida State Road 688|Ulmerton Road]] from [[Interstate 275 (Florida)|I-275]] westward to an expressway, and was to have provided an important link for east-west traffic through [[Largo, Florida|Largo]].  Land acquisition would have been extremely expensive, erasing the practicality of building the freeway, and it was canceled by 1976.  All that remains of this freeway plan is Ulmerton Road's very wide right-of-way, preserved by the state for the freeway when Ulmerton Road was expanded in the early 1970s.  Long-term widening of Ulmerton Road using the extended right-of-way to expand from four lanes to six lanes was completed in 2009.  Expansion to 8 lanes is underway in stages in 2015, with some sections complete.

== Georgia ==
{{Main|Atlanta freeway revolts}}
Local opposition was responsible for the death knell of a number of freeway projects in Metro [[Atlanta]], including the intown portion of the [[Stone Mountain Freeway]] from the existing [[U.S. 78]] freeway to what is now [[State Route 10 (Georgia)|Freedom Parkway]] in downtown Atlanta, and the intown portion of what would have been [[Interstate 485 (Georgia)|Interstate 485]]. The northern part of that freeway was built as [[Georgia 400]], while the southern portion of the highway exists as [[Interstate 675 (Georgia)|Interstate 675]]. The highways would have intersected in a large stack interchange complex roughly where the [[Carter Center]] exists today, east of downtown Atlanta. [[Interstate 420 (Georgia)|Interstate 420]] would have skirted the city limits of Atlanta to the south, running from [[Interstate 20]] in [[Decatur, Georgia|Decatur]] to [[Douglasville]]. The center portion of what would have become I-420 was constructed, and exists as [[Langford Parkway]].

Additional local protests and legislative action ended planning and construction of the [[Outer Perimeter]] and the Northern Arc, which would have surrounded Atlanta about 20 miles (32&amp;nbsp;km) outside of the present [[Interstate 285 (Georgia)|Perimeter Highway]].

== Illinois ==
*Since the 1960s, the [[Illinois Department of Transportation]] has sought to extend the freeway portion of [[Illinois Route 53]] into [[Lake County, Illinois|Lake County]] from its current northern terminus at [[Lake-Cook Road]]. The extension would meet a planned bypass for IL-120 near [[Grayslake, Illinois|Grayslake]], where it would split two ways. The eastern branch would head towards the [[Tri-State Tollway]] ([[Interstate 94|I-94]]), while the western branch would head towards [[U.S. Route 12 in Illinois|U.S. Route 12]] in western Lake County. The alignment for the route would take it through the village of [[Long Grove, Illinois|Long Grove]], the residents of which have fought a thus-far successful legal and political battle against the extension.  Many residents of cities such as [[Mundelein, Illinois|Mundelein]] and [[Lake Zurich, Illinois|Lake Zurich]], however, still display "BUILD 53" signs and bumper stickers. The extension is currently under study by the [[Illinois Tollway]], which was authorized in 1993 to construct and operate the highway.

*The Richmond-Waukegan Expressway (known as '''FAP 420''') was a highway that was to run from the proposed Illinois Route 53 extension northwest through McHenry County to the Wisconsin border in [[Richmond, Illinois|Richmond]]. It was to connect to the existing US 12 freeway in [[Genoa City, Wisconsin]], and the corridor was ultimately planned to extend all the way to [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]]. Wisconsin built a portion of the freeway between Genoa City and Elkhorn in the 1970s, but further construction was stopped when the upgrades on the Illinois side ran into opposition. Along with the Route 53 extension, the [[Illinois Tollway]] was authorized to construct and operate this highway in 1993. However, the project has been dormant since the mid-1990s, mainly due to major environmental complications along the route (the proposed corridor would run through two sensitive conservation areas: Glacial Park and Volo Bog). While the project has not been officially cancelled, this highway will likely never be built due to the aforementioned environmental impacts.

*The [[Crosstown Expressway (Interstate 494)|Crosstown Expressway]] was a proposed highway in the 1970s that would have run westward from near the present confluence of the [[Chicago Skyway]] and the [[Dan Ryan Expressway]] on Chicago's south side toward Cicero Avenue near [[Chicago Midway International Airport]]. From there, the freeway would have run northward along and parallel to Cicero to the [[Edens Expressway|Edens]] – [[Kennedy Expressway|Kennedy]] junction on the north side of Chicago. The highway, which would have been designated Interstate 494, was canceled in 1979 by then-Mayor [[Jane Byrne]] and then-Illinois Governor [[James R. Thompson|Jim Thompson]], both of whom cited the $1.2 billion price tag as reason enough to terminate the project. Monies from the aborted highway ultimately went to the construction of the [[Chicago Transit Authority]]'s [[Orange Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Orange Line]], connecting the Loop with Midway Airport, and an extension to the CTA's [[Blue Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Blue Line]], connecting downtown with [[O'Hare Airport]].  A "[[Mid-City Transitway]]" is under consideration.  

*The [[Amstutz Expressway]] was meant to be a lakeshore expressway in [[North Chicago, Illinois|North Chicago]] and [[Waukegan, Illinois|Waukegan]]. However, a large portion in northern North Chicago was never completed, so the road exists in two small portions. The Waukegan portion is frequently referred to as "The Highway to Nowhere" because of its uselessness. [[Sheridan Road]] runs along the expressway the entire length.

*There were plans to upgrade [[Lake Shore Drive]] to full Interstate standards, and two separate designations were proposed for this upgrade. First designated as Interstate 494 (before that designation was moved to the [[Crosstown Expressway (Interstate 494)|Crosstown Expressway]]), and later, Interstate 694, the project was canceled after opposition from North Side residents who didn't want an interstate in their communities, fearing that land along the shores of Lake Michigan would be lost. Lake Shore Drive remains a US route, rather than an interstate highway, with a mix of interchanges and at-grade intersections.

*The [[Fox Valley Freeway]] was intended to run from [[Interstate 55 in Illinois|I-55]] in [[Plainfield, Illinois|Plainfield]] to the US 12 freeway in [[Genoa City, Wisconsin]], linking the far west suburbs. However, intense local opposition cancelled the project in the early 1990s.

Environmental groups and the city of [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] have long protested the completion of [[Interstate 69 (Indiana)|Interstate 69]] through southwest Indiana, and have long favored an alternative route for I-69 that follows [[Interstate 70 (Indiana)|I-70]] and [[US-41]] through [[Terre Haute, Indiana|Terre Haute]] and [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]].  Their opposition has pitted them against residents in the southwest corner of the state and the cities of [[Evansville]], [[Petersburg, Indiana|Petersburg]] and [[Washington, Indiana|Washington]], which have long supported construction of the highway.  Opponents had held up construction of I-69 through southwest Indiana for 40 years through lawsuits, legislative maneuvering, and acts of vandalism. Supporters of the highway have accused opponents of attempting to isolate the southwest corner of Indiana from the remainder of the state with their efforts to block I-69 construction.  Ultimately, construction on I-69 began in 2008, and completed between Evansville and Bloomington in December 2015. and construction is underway to upgrade SR 37 to Interstate standards on the Bloomington-Martinsville section is scheduled for completion in late 2017.  Subject to available funding, the remaining section of I-69 from Martinsville to I-465 on the south side of Indianapolis may be completed by 2025.

In the northwest corner of Indiana, the [[Illiana Expressway]] was a proposed toll road as a southern bypass of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]].  Originally, the Illiana Expressway was envisioned to start at Interstate 57 in eastern Illinois, then intersect Interstate 65 near Lowell, Indiana before turning northeast, crossing US-30 near Valparaiso before terminating at the [[Indiana Toll Road]].  Due to opposition from environmental and community groups; and [[Indiana Toll Road Concession Company|operators of the Indiana Toll Road]], the section east of I-65 was dropped, but the Illiana Expressway was extended westward to Interstate 55 in Illinois.  Opponents filed a lawsuit to block construction of the Illiana Expressway in 2013, with a federal judge ordering a halt to work on the toll road in 2015.  Officials from the Federal Highway Administration, Indiana and Illinois appealed the court's ruling to the [[Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]] in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theherald-news.com/2015/08/17/state-federal-officials-to-appeal-illiana-expressway-federal-ruling/aab62yq/|title=State, federal officials to appeal Illiana Expressway federal ruling|publisher=The Herald News|date=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in January 2015 Illinois Governor [[Bruce Rauner]] removed the Illiana Expressway from the state's five-year transportation plan, effectively stripping funding for the Illinois portion of the highway.  Indiana Governor [[Mike Pence]] followed suit in suspending Indiana's portion of the Illiana Expressway in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.streetsblog.org/2015/02/12/the-final-nail-indiana-gov-says-illiana-expressway-boondoggle-on-hold/|title=The Final Nail?

== Louisiana ==
When [[Interstate 10|I-10]] was built through [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], a segment of formerly tree-lined ground along Claiborne Avenue was destroyed to build the elevated highway; because Claiborne Avenue was the main thoroughfare in a poorer, [[African-American neighborhood]], many in the community considered this to be racially prejudiced. While local efforts to stop this route of I-10 were unsuccessful, the disruption motivated residents to oppose further planned freeways through historic neighborhoods.

The proposed [[Vieux Carré Riverfront Expressway]] would have run along the [[Mississippi River]] in the [[French Quarter]] of New Orleans. Local preservationists worked to build popular support to stop the proposed elevated expressway in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Weingroff, Richard F. [http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/neworleans.htm "The Second Battle of New Orleans: Vieux Carré Riverfront Expressway (I-310)"], [[Federal Highway Administration]]. Accessed May 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maryland ==
Freeways [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|Interstate 95]], [[Interstate 83]], and [[Interstate 70]] are not directly connected to each other inside [[Baltimore]] city limits because of freeway revolts led by activist and later politician [[Barbara Mikulski]]. Mikulski became a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] and later a [[United States Senate|Senator]] after rising to prominence with freeway revolts. In particular, I-70 was stopped through [[Leakin Park]], and terminates at the Baltimore City line at a Park and Ride, just inside the [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695 Beltway]], rather than its planned terminus at I-95 exit 50 (currently US 1 Alternate: Caton Avenue), while I-83 terminates in downtown Baltimore at Fayette Street instead of connecting to I-95 at exit 57.  Additionally, Moravia Road was never built beyond I-95 exit 60; it was supposed to be connected to the Windlass Freeway ([[Maryland State Route 149|MD-149]]), which was canceled as well. A small portion of the Windlass Freeway was constructed, and it is now signed as [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcroads.net/roads/MD-149/|title=Windlass Freeway (MD 149, unbuilt)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional roads that would have formed a more complete freeway network in the city were abandoned or redesigned, leaving some short sections (the former [[Interstate 170 (Maryland)|I-170]], which was left unconnected to any other Interstate highway, so [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|US 40]] was re-routed onto it), or rights of way that were built as city streets rather than freeways (Martin Luther King Boulevard).

The Washington Outer Beltway was also met with decades of opposition in Maryland's suburbs of [[Washington, D.C.]] Though it met with fierce opposition for 50 years, the section between [[Interstate 370 (Maryland)|I-370]] and [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]], known as the Intercounty Connector and signed as [[Maryland Route 200]], ultimately opened in 2011.

== Massachusetts ==
The 1948 plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonroads.com/history/1948-plan/|title=Master Highway Plan (1948)|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Boston's inner suburbs included eight limited-access highways: the Central Artery and the East Boston, Western, Northern, Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, and Southwest Expressways.

Over time, several of the planned highways were constructed:
* [[East Boston Expressway]] (MA 1A), 1948–1951
* [[Central Artery]], 1951–59
* [[Southeast Expressway (Boston)|Southeast Expressway]] (I-93), 1954–59
* Western Expressway ([[Massachusetts Turnpike]]) 1955–59, Boston Extension 1962–65
* [[Interstate 93|Northern Expressway]] (I-93), 1956–73

In 1970, Governor [[Francis W. Sargent]] ordered the [[Boston Transportation Planning Review]], a review of all freeway plans within the [[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|Route 128]] beltway around [[Boston]].  As a result, several freeways were canceled in 1971 and 1972:

* The [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Expressway]] ([[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]]) to [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]] was replaced by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] [[Orange Line (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority)|Orange Line]], which itself was relocated from an [[elevated railroad]] route over Washington Street in the Roxbury neighborhood.  I-95 was rerouted to follow Route 128 around Boston.
* The [[Northeast Expressway (Boston)|Northeast Expressway]] (also I-95) to [[Peabody, Massachusetts|Peabody]] was largely eliminated.  The southernmost part, from northern Revere, southward, which was already built, is [[U.S. Route 1]]. The scrapped northern section would have bisected the [[Lynn Woods Reservation]] and the [[Rumney Marsh Reservation]].
* The [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Inner Belt]] ([[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 695]] and 95) around Boston was eliminated.  A short section (which would have been the I-95 part of the Inner Belt) was built as a city street in [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]].
* The 1965 plan for the [[Northwest Expressway (Boston)|Northwest Expressway]] would have connected the Inner Belt in Cambridge with the current [[U.S. Route 3]] interchange at Route 128 in [[Burlington, Massachusetts|Burlington]].  The new highway from Route 128 would have connected with the existing [[Concord Turnpike]] near the Lexington-Arlington border, which would carry both [[Route 2 (Massachusetts)|Route 2]] through Arlington to Alewife.  A second stretch of new highway would run from Alewife through [[Porter Square]] to a connection with the Inner Belt in [[Union Square, Somerville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xefer.com/2002/10/innerbelt|title=I-695: The Boston Inner Beltway|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the moratorium, Routes 2 and 3 were left on their previous routings, with Route 2 becoming a surface road inbound of Alewife and Route 3 a surface road inside Route 128 (both roughly following the [[Charles River]] into downtown Boston).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brorson.com/maps/BostonHighwayPlan_1965/BostonHighwayPlan_1965.jpg |accessdate=October 4, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923191204/http://www.brorson.com/maps/BostonHighwayPlan_1965/BostonHighwayPlan_1965.jpg |archivedate=September 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In place of the highway project, the MBTA [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] was extended from [[Harvard (MBTA station)|Harvard]] to [[Alewife (MBTA station)|Alewife]].  (A 1948 plan used a different path for Route 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonroads.com/history/1948-map/|title=Map of the Master Highway Plan (1948)|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The Northern Expressway was granted an exemption because it was nearly complete.  Its final {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}} segment was completed in 1973 with a section from East Somerville to the North Station area of downtown Boston.&lt;ref&gt;Northern Expressway, I-93 BostonRoads.com http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/northern/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Central Artery]] had cut a swath through Downtown [[Boston]] neighborhoods, creating one of the greatest eyesores in urban America during the 1950s. Because of this, it would earn its nickname "The ''Other'' Green Monster", both a play on its greenish color and on the name of the [[Green Monster|tall left field wall]] in [[Fenway Park]].  Starting in 1991, the Central Artery was rerouted into [[Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel|a replacement underground tunnel network]], and the elevated highway was demolished and replaced by [[Rose Kennedy Greenway|linear parks]] and new buildings, in a massive project known as the "[[Big Dig]]".

There was also a plan in Western Massachusetts of an upgrade of [[U.S. Route 7]] from [[Lee, Massachusetts|Lee]] to [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts|Pittsfield]] and points north of there. The highway was to have a {{convert|60|foot|m|adj=on}} median. There was also plans of a spur off to [[Dalton, Massachusetts|Dalton]] of [[Massachusetts Route 9]]. Local opposition led to the demise of the Route 7 Freeway.

== Michigan ==

=== Detroit ===
{{See also|Transportation in metropolitan Detroit}}
In the 1970s, after years of simmering outrage about the Chrysler Freeway (I-75) destroying the [[Black Bottom, Detroit|Black Bottom neighborhood]], [[Coleman A. Young|Mayor Coleman Young]] used the issue as political capital by decreeing the cancellation all freeway projects in Detroit. City Council soon followed his wishes. This included three interconnected major projects, the final ten miles of [[Interstate 96]] along [[Grand River Avenue]] from the Jeffries to the Northwest corner of the city, the already in progress conversion of Mound Road to the M-53 freeway from [[Detroit City Airport]] to the [[M-53 (Michigan highway)|Van Dyke Expressway]], and a planned extension of the [[M-8 (Michigan highway)|Davison Freeway]] on both ends which was to be a connector with both [[Interstate 96]] and the Jeffries Freeway on its west to the Mound freeway conversion on its east.

Ignoring the initial protests, a huge freeway-to-freeway interchange was constructed for the Davison extension at Exit 186 of the Jeffries, and a massive stacked freeway-to-freeway interchange was also constructed on Exit 22 of I-696 at Mound Road. Both of these intersections see much less traffic than they were designed for.

With the cancellation of the Grand River freeway conversion, I-96 was rerouted west of its interchange with Grand River at Exit 185, paralleling the [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] rail line along Fullerton Avenue before turning northward at Exit 182 to overtake Schoolcraft Avenue. I-96 continues westward as an extension of the Jeffries Freeway through [[Redford, Michigan|Redford]] and [[Livonia, Michigan|Livonia]] with Schoolcraft serving as a [[Frontage road|service drive]] until I-96 connects with [[Interstate 275 in Michigan|I-275]].

The cancellation also scrubbed plans to connect the Mound Road freeway which had already cleared the land to the existing [[M-53 (Michigan highway)|M-53]], Van Dyke Expressway, although further development of [[Macomb County, Michigan|Macomb County]] has revived speculation on at least this portion of highway. The land impact would be minimized along the Mound Road corridor, as Mound was constructed as a multilane divided highway with a particularly wide median, suggesting that MDOT planned for this stretch to be upgraded to a full freeway at some point in the future.

While the revolts indeed had stopped the freeways from being built through several Detroit neighborhoods, many homes, neighborhoods, and even historical buildings had been destroyed to make way for interstate freeway construction, by the controversial means of [[Eminent Domain]].  All the saved neighborhoods suffered urban blight regardless.

=== Oakland County ===
In the 1970s, [[Interstate 275 (Michigan)|Interstate 275]] was planned to bypass Detroit and [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]], connecting with its parent route, [[Interstate 75]], near the city of [[Monroe, Michigan|Monroe]] at the southern end, and [[Clarkston, Michigan|Clarkston]] at the northern end. I-275 was slightly realigned when it was determined that it would be more feasible to align [[Interstate 96]] along Schoolcraft Avenue instead of the more heavily developed [[M-5 (Michigan highway)|Grand River Avenue]] as originally planned, and part of I-275 would now carry I-96.

As construction progressed on the massive ramps that would connect I-275 to the existing interchange of I-96 and the western terminus of I-696, fierce opposition rose up from residents within several Oakland County communities, including [[Commerce Township, Michigan|Commerce Township]], through where much of I-275 would have run. Environmental concerns were cited, as well as fears of dropping property values. As a result, the construction of I-275 north of I-96/I-696 was canceled. A stub from the former eastern leg of I-96, redesignated part of [[M-102 (Michigan highway)|M-102]], to what would have been northbound I-275, was left behind, as was a ramp that ran parallel to the westbound I-96 ramp that would've carried northbound I-275 and connected with the ramp from M-102.

The stubs, as well as previously unbuilt bridges and ramps, were opened in 1994 as a freeway extension was built up to 12 Mile Road. This extension was designated as [[M-5 (Michigan highway)|M-5]]. Between 1994 and 2002, M-5 was extended further northward along the right-of-way that had been reserved for I-275, but as a grade-level expressway with traffic lights at 13 Mile, 14 Mile, and Maple Roads, and a grade-level railroad crossing between Maple Road and M-5's northern terminus at Pontiac Trail. Local residents continue to resist further expansion, even as Commerce Township slowly succumbs to [[urban sprawl]].

In addition to the resistance against I-275, a planned extension from [[M-10 (Michigan highway)|Northwestern Highway]] to I-275 was shelved in the 1970s as part of the same revolt. Although talks of reviving the Northwestern Extension continued for decades, development of the land along the proposed extension's right-of-way, including a [[strip mall]] right at Northwestern's current terminus, has effectively ended any chance of such a freeway being constructed.

== Minnesota ==
There were once plans for a northern bypass route of downtown [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]]; this bypass was to be signed as [[Interstate 335 (Minnesota)|Interstate 335]]. Grading for I-335's connections to [[Interstate 35W (Minnesota)|I-35W]] and [[Interstate 94|I-94]], as well as land acquisition and demolition for the road's right-of-way, had already begun when local residents protested I-335's proposed path through their communities. Stub ramps on I-35W, some of which are now part of the Johnson Street interchange, remain as clues to where I-335 would have begun; more stub ramps can also be found on I-94 at the North 3rd Street interchange.

== New Jersey ==
As planned in the 1960s, the [[Somerset Freeway]], which would have connected [[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|Interstate 95]] from [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] to [[Interstate 287]] near [[Metuchen, New Jersey|Metuchen]], would have cut through some wealthy established properties around [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]].  In addition, the [[New Jersey Turnpike Authority]], whose roadway runs from the [[Delaware Memorial Bridge]] to [[New York City]], feared that the paralleling toll-free highway could take away traffic (and revenue) south of the I-287 interchange. In 1982, an act of Congress allowed the Somerset Freeway to be dropped, but stipulated that I-95 would be rerouted, via the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] into New Jersey.  This [[Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project|I-95/PA Turnpike interchange]], was constructed starting in 2013, and completed in 2018.&lt;ref name=tsl&gt;{{cite web |last=Frassinelli|first=Mike|accessdate=September 20, 2010|title=N.J., Pennsylvania officials plan to close longtime gap on Route 95|publisher=''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' |date=September 7, 2010|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/09/nj_pa_officials_plan_to_close.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; When completed, the new interchange made I-95 a continuous route between [[Miami|Miami, Florida]], and [[Houlton, Maine]].

A similar plan involving [[Interstate 78]] would have bisected the town of [[Phillipsburg, New Jersey|Phillipsburg]], but [[New Jersey Department of Transportation|NJDOT]] and PennDOT, under opposition from local residents, decided to reroute I-78 south of the [[Lehigh Valley]] area, on what would have been the planned [[Interstate 278 (Pennsylvania)|I-278]] bypass. This led to the downgrade of [[Pennsylvania Route 378|I-378]] in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] from an Interstate highway to a PA State highway route. The completion of I-78 through the [[Watchung Reservation]] in [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]] was also delayed until the early 1980s due to litigation opposing its route through the park.

== New York ==
{{See also|List of unused highways in New York}}

=== New York City ===

Several expressways in [[New York City]], mostly planned by [[Robert Moses]], were canceled because of public oppositions, including two that would have been built through Midtown and Lower Manhattan.

The [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]] was planned to carry [[Interstate 78]] from its current terminus at the end of the [[Holland Tunnel]] through Lower Manhattan to the [[Williamsburg Bridge]] with a connection to the [[Manhattan Bridge]] at Canal Street. The Expressway would have been built directly through such neighborhoods as [[Greenwich Village]], [[SoHo]], and the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]], much of which was characterized as old and "run down" by the mid-20th century. After a long battle, the expressway was canceled in the 1970s by New York Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] due to fears of increased pollution and negative effects on such cultural neighborhoods as [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]] and [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]].

The [[Mid-Manhattan Expressway]] was planned to run directly through the busy [[Midtown Manhattan]] business district just south of [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]], and would pass very close to the [[Empire State Building]]. The Expressway was to carry [[Interstate 495 (New York)|Interstate 495]] from the [[Lincoln Tunnel]] (where I-495 was to continue to the [[New Jersey Turnpike]]) to the [[Queens Midtown Tunnel]] where it would connect to the [[Long Island Expressway]].  The expressway was originally very popular among local leaders, and Moses had gone so far as to run the Expressway right through Manhattan skyscrapers.  However, fears of increased vehicular traffic in the already congested city brought cancellation in 1971.

Expressways in the boroughs outside Manhattan had been planned but later canceled, including the [[Bushwick Expressway]], an extension of [[Interstate 78]] through [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]] that would run from the [[Williamsburg Bridge]] (at the end of the [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]]) to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]].  Also, the Cross Brooklyn Expressway, a faster commercial route paralleling the [[Belt Parkway]] from the [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]] to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], was canceled.  The Bushwick was canceled largely due to the cancellation of the Lower Manhattan Expressway. For this reason, none of I-78's spur routes connect to I-78; the closest connection would have been made by [[Interstate 478]] via the [[Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel]].

Other expressway cancellations included the [[Queens-Interboro Expressway]], which would have connected the [[Queens Midtown Tunnel]] with southern neighborhoods of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]]; and the [[Cross Harlem Expressway]], which would have run in the vicinity of [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th Street]] in [[Harlem]] from the [[Triborough Bridge]] to the [[Hudson River]] (plans also included building a bridge at 125th Street to New Jersey over the Hudson).

In [[Queens]], the [[Clearview Expressway]] abruptly ends in the neighborhood of [[Hollis, Queens|Hollis]].  It was slated to continue south to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], but was canceled. The proposed segment near JFK Airport was built as the [[JFK Expressway]] between 1989 and 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/jfk/|title=JFK Expressway @ NYCROADS.com|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[The Bronx]], the [[Sheridan Expressway]] was to run from the [[Bruckner Expressway]] in the [[South Bronx]] to the Westchester County Line where it would meet with the [[New England Thruway]]).  However, this extension was canceled and today the Sheridan Expressway runs a very short route from the [[Bruckner Expressway]] to the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]].  In [[Staten Island]], the [[Korean War Veterans Parkway|Richmond Parkway]] was left unfinished north of [[Arthur Kill Road]] due to community and environmentalist pressures because it would have cut-through and thus destroyed the [[Staten Island Greenbelt]] which is one of the largest natural areas in the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation|New York City parks system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/korean-war-vets/|title=Korean War Veterans Parkway|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For many of the same reasons, the [[New York State Route 440|Willowbrook Parkway]] which would have shared an interchange with the Richmond Parkway was also left unbuilt south of [[Victory Boulevard (Staten Island)|Victory Boulevard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/mlk/|title=Dr. Martin L King Jr Expressway (NY 440)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in Staten Island, the construction of much of the [[Father Capodanno Boulevard|Shore Front Drive]] was stopped for good when the city handed over [[Great Kills Park]], which contained a long stretch of the parkway's right-of-way, to the [[National Park Service]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycroads.com/roads/shore-front-SI/ Shore Front Drive: STOPPING MOSES IN HIS TRACKS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007073141/http://www.nycroads.com/roads/shore-front-SI/ |date=October 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local groups protested the construction of these expressways through their neighborhoods.  Completed expressways such as the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]], which is largely credited for the destruction and dereliction of the [[Tremont, Bronx|Tremont]] neighborhood, and the [[Brooklyn-Queens Expressway]], stirred resentment and opposition to further construction.

=== Long Island ===
New York City was not the only part of New York to face an onslaught of freeway revolts. [[Long Island]] had dozens of roads planned by the New York State Department of Transportation, as well as Suffolk and Nassau Counties, although not all the roads were intended to be freeways (see [[List of Suffolk County (New York) Road proposals]]). On two occasions, Suffolk County built roads and allowed them to be redesignated as state highways, in the hope that the state would upgrade them when the county couldn't. The following is a list of roads throughout New York State that were either canceled, truncated, or stalled.

=== Buffalo-Niagara Falls ===
Buffalo-Niagara Falls was also not immune to freeway revolts. An extensive system of highways and parkways were planned to be built in the counties of Niagara and Erie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Unknown Stories of Western New York : The Buffalo Beltway {{!}} wgrz.com|url = http://archive.wgrz.com/news/article/220841/13/Unknown-Stories-of-Western-New-York--The-Buffalo-Beltway|website = wgrz.com|accessdate = 2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ohio ==
===Cleveland===
[[Cuyahoga County, Ohio]] proposed three freeways that would bisect Cleveland’s eastern suburbs and parkland including Cleveland Heights, Shaker Heights and East Cleveland. The [[Interstate 290 (Ohio)|Clark Freeway]] was to connect I-271 with downtown Cleveland via Shaker Boulevard, the Shaker Lakes, North Park Boulevard and East Cleveland. The Lee Freeway was to run north from an interchange with the Clark Freeway at Shaker Lakes over Lee Road to the Heights Freeway that would have run east–west approximately where Monticello Blvd and Taylor roads are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Corridor Report for Interstate and Alternate Routes in the Cuyahoga County Freeway System (Report Number 1)|author=[[Cuyahoga County, Ohio]] |publisher=[[HNTB|Howard, Needles, Tammen &amp; Bergendoff]]|date=December 1957|url=http://images.ulib.csuohio.edu/cdm/ref/collection/urbanohio/id/2611|access-date=February 15, 2018|at=Figure 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local residents blocked all three highways. One of several key actions was the 1966 formation of the [[Nature Center at Shaker Lakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=O'Malley|title=Women saved Shaker Lakes from freeways|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=September 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chuh.net/chhistory/features/freeways.html|title=Feature Stories: When Bad Ideas Happen to Good Suburbs: The Clark, Lee and Heights Freeways|access-date=February 15, 2018|author=[[Cleveland Heights, Ohio|Cleveland Heights]] Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cincinnati===
Cincinnati also had a freeway revolt: the Colerain, Queen City and Taft Expressways were never built (though a particularly congested segment of Queen City Avenue was eventually bypassed in 2005) and the Red Bank Expressway, designed as a freeway connection between [[Interstate 71 (Ohio)|Interstate 71]] and [[U.S. Route 50 in Ohio|U.S. Route 50]], was built instead as a surface artery, albeit with limited intersections. There are prominent ramp stubs at the interchange of [[Interstate 74 (Ohio)|Interstate 74]] and Beekman Street that would have connected I-74 to the Colerain Expressway.

In addition, the [[Ronald Reagan Cross County Highway|Cross County Highway]], which was designed to connect the eastern and western sides of I-275 through Hamilton County, was built, but never fully completed.  For years, the highway existed in two separate segments; the eastern segment was built between Galbraith Road and Montgomery Road (just east of I-71) in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  In the mid-1970s, the western stretch was built from Colerain Avenue (U.S. Route 27) to the western side of I-275.  While these segments were finally connected in 1997, and the highway was renamed the Ronald Reagan Highway, the three-mile (5&amp;nbsp;km) stretch between Montgomery Road and the eastern side of I-275 was never built due to protests from wealthy residents of [[Indian Hill, Ohio|The&lt;!-- yes, capitalized --&gt; Village of Indian Hill]], who convinced officials to stop the highway's construction from occurring in the city. This resulted in the lack of a direct freeway connection between existing Interstate 74 and its proposed extension along [[Ohio State Route 32]] to the east toward the Carolinas.

== Oklahoma ==

=== Tulsa ===

In the 1960s, the Riverside Expressway was planned to be built in [[Tulsa]] along Riverside Drive and a former railroad right-of-way. The route would have started at the Inner Dispersal Loop ([[I-444]]) and continued south along present-day Riverside Drive. Activists led by Betsy Horowitz started campaigning against the planned expressway in 1968. Much of the opposition came from the [[Maple Ridge (Tulsa)|Maple Ridge]] neighborhood, where part of the route would have passed. The Riverside Expressway was cancelled in 1972, following a federal lawsuit that blocked funding needed for its construction. Its cancellation also made possible the creation of Tulsa's River Parks system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/blogs/news/throwbacktulsa/throwback-tulsa-riverside-drive-s-long-winding-history-of-controversy/article_55ab7428-92aa-5d9e-af68-3dfbc9a1adaf.html Throwback Tulsa: Riverside Drive’s long, winding history of controversy]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oregon ==

=== Portland ===
{{See also|Mount Hood Freeway|Interstate 505 (Oregon)}}
Shortly after World War II, the city leaders of [[Portland, Oregon]] commissioned famed transportation planner [[Robert Moses]] to design a freeway network for the city.  Moses produced a proposal which called for numerous freeways to crisscross the city; of this proposal six freeway routes made it to the planning stage.  Four of the six were eventually constructed (in some cases in the face of intense opposition); these are:

* The ''Banfield Freeway'' ([[Interstate 84 in Oregon|Interstate 84]])
* The ''Baldock Freeway'' ([[Interstate 5 in Oregon|Interstate 5]])
* The ''Stadium Freeway'' ([[Interstate 405 (Oregon)|Interstate 405]])
* The ''East Portland Freeway'' ([[Interstate 205 (Oregon-Washington)|Interstate 205]])

However, two other planned freeways—the [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|Interstate 505]] freeway, and the [[Mount Hood Freeway]], were far more controversial.  Each proposed route cut through established city neighborhoods.  An intense battle arose over the Mount Hood Freeway, a proposed routing of [[U.S. Route 26 in Oregon|U.S. Route 26]] and Interstate 84 (then 80N) that stretched from the [[Marquam Bridge]] out to the city of [[Sandy, Oregon|Sandy]] at the base of [[Mount Hood]].  One section of the freeway—an [[Limited-access road|expressway]] stretch between Sandy and [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]] with an uncompleted interchange—was built; but the remainder was controversial.

The 1972 mayoral race, with [[Neil Goldschmidt]] representing the anti-freeway side and [[Frank Ivancie]] representing the supporters of the freeway, became a de facto referendum on the proposed route. The election was won by Goldschmidt and the freeway was canceled.  The proposed federal funds for the project were instead made available for a planned [[light rail]] line, built in the 1980s to connect Portland with Gresham and now part of the [[MAX Blue Line]]. This light-rail network is steadily expanding, including sections along Interstate 205 in room that resulted from the controversy.

Soon after, the Interstate 505 proposal was also canceled; a shorter freeway "stub" was built instead, and [[U.S. Route 30 in Oregon|U.S. Route 30]] was routed on a new alignment through an industrial area (and away from the residential neighborhood that its prior alignment—and the I-505 proposal—ran through).

In addition to the cancellation of three proposed freeway routes, Portland saw another milestone in the freeway revolts: the destruction of an already-existing freeway.  The first freeway to be built through the city—[[Harbor Drive]] (along the western shore of the [[Willamette River]]), which was, at the time, the route of [[Oregon Route 99W]]—was closed in May 1974, demolished and replaced with [[Tom McCall Waterfront Park]], which opened in 1978.  99W was moved onto nearby Front Avenue (the stretch of 99W through Portland would be later decommissioned), and little evidence remains that there was once a freeway along the waterfront.  The removal of Harbor Drive was not very controversial; the construction of I-5 on the river's East Bank, and I-405 through the downtown core, had made Harbor Drive unnecessary.

=== Elsewhere in Oregon ===
Other Oregon freeway revolts occurred in [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]] and [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]].  In Salem, the [[Interstate 305 (Oregon)|Interstate 305]] project was shelved and replaced with the Salem Parkway, a highway along the same alignment but with at-grade intersections.  In Eugene, the [[Roosevelt Freeway (Oregon)|Roosevelt Freeway]] and [[West Eugene Parkway]] projects were canceled,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/HWY/REGION2/wep.shtml Northwest Region- Region 2 West Eugene Parkway Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Belt Line Road (Oregon)|Belt Line Road]] was severely curtailed; only the northwestern segment of the proposed [[beltway]] was ever built.

== Pennsylvania ==

=== Philadelphia ===

There were plans for the [[Interstate 695 (Pennsylvania)|Cobbs Creek Expressway]], which would have started at [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]] and run up the western edge of Philadelphia, along with the Crosstown Expressway, which would have connected back to I-95 near [[Center City, Philadelphia|downtown]]. Both freeways were part of a planned routing of Interstate 695. Because of community opposition, neither freeway was constructed. (Additionally, the position of the Crosstown Expressway portion of I-695 between the [[Interstate 76 (east)|Schuylkill]] and [[Interstate 676|Vine Street Expressway]]s would be considered redundant, particularly because of its close proximity to the Vine Street Expressway.) Several non-interstate freeways inside Philadelphia were also cancelled, including the Pulaski Expressway (PA 90) which would have connected the [[Betsy Ross Bridge]] and I-95 with [[Roosevelt Boulevard (Philadelphia)|Roosevelt Boulevard]], along with the [[Roosevelt Expressway (Philadelphia)|Roosevelt Expressway Extension]] (an upgrade of Roosevelt Boulevard from Old York Road to Adams Avenue) and the Northeast Expressway (a new alignment for [[US 1 (PA)|US 1]] from Adams Avenue to [[PA 132|Street Road]] in [[Bensalem, Pennsylvania|Bensalem]]). Outside the city, an [[Interstate 895 (New Jersey-Pennsylvania)|Interstate 895]] was planned to connect the Philadelphia suburbs of [[Bristol, Pennsylvania]] and [[Burlington, New Jersey]].

A section of [[Pennsylvania Route 23]] was once planned for an expressway upgrade, and construction on one segment of the expressway began, but lack of funding at the state level halted construction of further segments. The grading and several overpasses for the expressway still exist, but as a mostly unpaved section that has since gained popularity as the "[[Pennsylvania Route 23#Goat Path Expressway|Goat Path Expressway]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadfan.com/man4.html|title=PA 23: The Goat Path (The Proposed Lancaster-Norristown Expressway)|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2008}}, the route is still under consideration by PennDOT, and appears in the Commonwealth 12-Year Transportation Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paroute23.com/about_project/history.htm|title=PA 23 EIS – About the Project – Project History|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pittsburgh ===
A freeway revolt also occurred in Pittsburgh, where stub ramps near the [[Birmingham Bridge]] exist from the cancellation of the unbuilt Oakland Crosstown Freeway. Other canceled freeways include the South Hills Expressway, Pittsburgh-[[McKeesport]] Expressway, and the East Liberty Expressway.

== Tennessee ==
[[Interstate 40 in Tennessee]] was planned to go through Memphis's [[Overton Park]] but public opposition, combined with a [[United States Supreme Court]] victory by opponents, forced abandonment. The eastern portion of the road had already been built inside the [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|Interstate 240]] loop and this non-interstate highway is now named [[Sam Cooper Boulevard]] while the northern portion of the I-240 loop was redesignated as I-40.

== Texas ==
The [[Trans-Texas Corridor]] plan was cancelled due to widespread opposition from environmental groups, fiscal conservatives, and property rights activists.  The 4,000-mile network of [[supercorridor]]s, were envisioned to be 1,200 feet in width and accommodate separate carriageways for automobiles and trucks; rail lines, and utility conduits.  Opposition to the Trans-Texas Corridor plan was so strong that then-Governor [[Rick Perry]] and other high-level state officials were threatened with [[impeachment]] had they given final approval to move forward with construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Campaign-to-impeach-Gov-Perry-launched-online-1817785.php|title=Campaign to impeach Gov. Perry launched online|publisher=Houston Chronicle|date=August 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Houston===

The inner city segment of [[Texas State Highway 225]] was originally planned to begin in downtown Houston and traverse the city's predominantly Hispanic east side as the [[Texas State Highway 225|Harrisburg Freeway]], but was never built due to neighborhood opposition and environmental concerns. [[Ghost ramps]] are still visible today at the west end of the freeway's planned route at [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|Loop 610]], while they were once visible on the [[Interstate 69 in Texas|I-69]]/[[U.S. Route 59 in Texas|US 59]] elevated downtown, prior to reconstruction in the late 1990s.

==Vermont==

===Burlington===
The Burlington Beltline was a planned highway envisioned in the 1960s to be built around the Burlington metropolis with the freeway cutting through the waterfront for access to the core business district. The only part of this built to federal specifications was Interstate 189, a short two mile spur. Various parts of the Beltline have been built piecemeal as both divided and undivided two lane freeways.

=== Central and Northeastern ===
Another conceived freeway (proposed to be designated as either I-92 or I-98 in different versions of the plan) that has been continually protested is a proposal by the state of Maine and business interests in Maine and Vermont for a freeway extending from Montpelier at I-89, crossing to St. Johnsbury, meeting up with I-93, then splitting right after crossing into New Hampshire. The freeway would cut straight across northern New Hampshire into Maine, where it would cut down to Maine's coastal cities. The freeway has been called a critical link for loggers in Maine to reach Western markets in the U.S. and Canada.

== Virginia ==
[[File:VA 07 2012 I395 HOV 3859.JPG|thumb|400px|Existing I-95/395 two-lane barrier-separated [[reversible lane|reversible]] [[HOV lane|HOV facility]]. The segment shown in the photo was proposed for conversion to HO/T operation as three lanes, but was dropped from the final project.]]
Construction of I-66 inside the Washington Beltway was blocked by environmental litigation until a compromise was reached that limited it to a four-lane limited access highway that is [[HOV]] only during rush hours.

Construction of a third reversible lane to be operated as [[High-occupancy toll lane|HOT]] for a half day in the direction of rush hour traffic on [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia–Virginia)|Interstate 395]] was blocked by [[Arlington County, Virginia]] and [[Alexandria, Virginia]] through successful environmental litigation. As a result, the 95 Express Lanes end at the Alexandria border.

== Washington ==
The [[R.H. Thomson Expressway]], connecting [[Interstate 90]] to [[Washington State Route 520|State Route 520]] through the [[Central District, Seattle, Washington|Central District]], [[Madison Valley, Seattle, Washington|Madison Valley]], and [[Washington Park Arboretum]], and the [[Bay Freeway (Seattle)|Bay Freeway]], connecting [[Interstate 5]] to [[Washington State Route 99|State Route 99]] in [[South Lake Union, Seattle, Washington|South Lake Union]] near [[Seattle Center]], faced mounting protests beginning in 1969.  The death of these two highways is generally considered to be the 1972 referendum that withdrew their funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=3114|publisher=HistoryLink|title= Seattle voters scrap proposed Bay Freeway and R. H. Thomson Expressway on February 8, 1972|author=Walt Crowley|date=March 19, 2001|accessdate=July 14, 2009|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, the state legislature proposed [[Interstate 605 (Washington)|Interstate 605]] as a second bypass of Seattle. Similar proposals were made in 2000 and 2003. While the routings have varied, public opposition has shut down each of the projects.

After the [[Alaskan Way Viaduct]] in Seattle was damaged by an earthquake in 2001, there was a significant political movement to not replace it, including large majorities voting against both replacement options, but the [[Washington State Department of Transportation]] voted to allocate funding to build a tunnel to replace the viaduct. A large number of citizens, including Seattle mayor [[Mike McGinn]], vowed to stop this tunnel. However, construction to replace it is now underway.

In 1964, the Spokane Metropolitan Area Transportation Study was formed to fulfill requirements of Federal Highway Act of 1962, and in 1970, along with the Department of Highways, released the "Corridor Study for North Spokane and North Suburban Area Freeway". It recommended a north–south freeway along Hamilton and Nevada streets (the corridor between Nevada and Helena). Though a full freeway interchange connecting Hamilton Street with I-90 (exit 282/282A) was built, residents successfully blocked any further construction through this area. The remaining section of the freeway stub is now [[Washington State Route 290]]. The North-South Freeway (now known as the [[North Spokane Corridor]]) was reawakened in 1997 when a new corridor was chosen, and is currently under construction.

== Washington, D.C. ==
Plans to build [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]], [[Interstate 95 in Washington D.C.|Interstate 95]], [[Interstate 295 (Maryland–District of Columbia)|Interstate 295]] and [[Interstate 66]], as well as a proposed [[Interstate 266]] over a new [[Three Sisters (Washington, D.C.)|Three Sisters]] Bridge through Washington, D.C. and the Maryland and Virginia suburbs were canceled in 1977 due to public opposition.&lt;ref name=rttf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadstothefuture.com/DC_Interstate_Fwy.html|title=Original freeway plans for Washington, DC|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is why [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]] (the originally planned I-95 Center Leg Freeway) ends at New York Avenue and Interstate 95 goes around the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]] rather than continuing through the city.&lt;ref name=rttf /&gt; Funds for several of these projects were redirected to the construction of the [[Washington Metro]].

== Wisconsin ==
In [[Milwaukee]], several planned freeways were either never built, partially built, or partially built but subsequently demolished and replaced with an at-grade boulevard.

* The [[Lake Freeway]] was designed to be the eastern leg of an inner loop around downtown Milwaukee, to extend along the lakefront south from the [[Park Freeway]] to Bay View and southeastern Milwaukee and thence through the southeastern suburbs, with a proposed extension to run much further south, through central [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]] and [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]], [[Wisconsin]], continuing further south through [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago's]] northeastern lakefront [[suburb]]s, where a portion of the proposed freeway was constructed, and is today the Interstate-standard section of [[Lake Shore Drive]].  Besides [[Lake Shore Drive]] in Chicago, along with the never-completed [[Illinois Route 137|Amstutz Expressway]] through [[Waukegan, Illinois|Waukegan]], the only portion of this system that is completed to Interstate standards is a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} portion of [[Interstate 794]], although a portion of the route south of the official southern terminus of Interstate 794 continues as 4-lane divided controlled-access freeway, as [[Highway 794 (Wisconsin)|Highway 794]], or the [[Lake Parkway]].
* The northern end of the Lake Freeway turned westward, and this section became known as the [[Park Freeway]].  This was the northern leg of the inner loop.  The eastern section was known as the [[Park East Freeway]] and the western section as the [[Park West Freeway]], with the dividing point at the intersection with [[Interstate 43|I-43]].  The Park West Freeway was intended to run northwesterly along Fond du Lac Avenue, and then turn westward just north of North Avenue.  A major intersection with the [[Stadium Freeway (Wisconsin)|Stadium Freeway]] was planned for the area around 45th and North Avenue.  The right-of-way for the entire corridor was cleared.  Due to neighborhood opposition, the only section of this freeway completed was from Milwaukee Street to Walnut Street.  The above-grade section between Milwaukee Street and 6th Street was removed and replaced by an at-grade boulevard – McKinley Boulevard.  Part of this corridor remains vacant, but most of the corridor has been developed or has development plans in place.
* The [[Stadium Freeway (Wisconsin)|Stadium Freeway]] was partially completed.  The original plan was for its south end to be at [[I-894]]/[[Interstate 43|I-43]] near Loomis Road.  From that point it would extend northward, intersecting [[I-94]] at the [[Stadium Interchange]] and proceeding northward to its intersection with the [[Park Freeway]].  From there it would jog northwesterly until heading north, parallelling 60th Street and continuing north to [[Port Washington, Wisconsin|Port Washington]] where it met with [[Interstate 43|I-43]].  The only section built was that between National Avenue and Lisbon Avenue, today's [[Wisconsin Highway 175]].
* Another planned freeway was the [[Bay Freeway (Milwaukee)|Bay Freeway]].  This was to be the northern bypass around the central city, complementing [[I-894]] which is the built southern bypass.  The Bay Freeway eastern point was I-43 at Hampton Avenue.  The freeway was to run over Hampton Avenue, westward to the intersection with the [[Stadium Freeway (Wisconsin)|Stadium Freeway]] and the [[Fond du Lac Freeway]].  From there it continued westward to [[Pewaukee]] where it would meet with [[Wisconsin Highway 16]].  No section of the Bay Freeway was ever built.
* The [[Belt Freeway (Milwaukee)|Belt Freeway]] was to be a freeway encircling the metro Milwaukee area on the south, west and north sides.  No section of the Belt Freeway was ever built.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7626">[[Laos]] is primarily a source country for women and girls [[human trafficking|trafficked]] for [[commercial sexual exploitation]] and [[labor exploitation]] as domestics or factory workers in [[Thailand]]. Some [[Lao people|Lao men, women, and children]] migrate to neighboring countries in search of better economic opportunities but are subjected to conditions of [[forced labor|forced]] or [[bonded labor]] or [[forced prostitution]] after arrival. Some Lao men who migrate willingly to Thailand are subjected to conditions of [[involuntary servitude]] in the Thai fishing and construction industry. To a lesser extent Laos is a country of transit for [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Bamar|Burmese]] women destined for Thailand. Laos’ potential as a transit country is on the rise with the construction of new highways linking the [[People’s Republic of China]], [[Vietnam]], Thailand, and [[Cambodia]] through Laos. Internal trafficking is also a problem that affects young women and girls who are trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation in urban areas.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Laos". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2008/105388.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2008'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 4, 2008). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Government of Laos]] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however it is making significant efforts to do so. The government increased law enforcement efforts to investigate trafficking offenses and prosecute and punish trafficking offenders. It also increased collaboration with international organizations and civil society to provide training for government and law enforcement officials, to provide repatriation and reintegration services for victims, and to launch public awareness campaigns to combat trafficking. A severe lack of resources remains the biggest impediment to the government’s ability to combat trafficking in persons and it remains dependent on the international donor community to fund anti-trafficking activities.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2 Watchlist"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The Lao government demonstrated progress in its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts and willingness to collaborate with other countries as well as NGOs and international organizations. Laos prohibits all forms of trafficking through Penal Code Article 134, which prescribes penalties that are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for rape. In 2007, the Ministry of Public Security used Article 134 to investigate 38 cases of trafficking, resulting in 23 arrests and eight ongoing prosecutions. An additional 20 cases are currently under investigation. Police corruption, a weak judicial sector and the population’s general lack of understanding of the court system impeded anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. Through legal aid clinics, the Lao Bar Association assisted victims by educating the public at large on the legal system and by providing legal advice to victims of human rights abuses, including human trafficking. Corruption remained a problem with government officials susceptible to involvement or collusion in trafficking in persons, narcotics, wildlife, and [[illegal logging]]. No government or law enforcement officials have been disciplined or punished for involvement in trafficking in persons. The Lao government worked with international organizations and civil society to increase law enforcement capacity through training for police, investigators, prosecutors, and customs and border officials.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The Lao government demonstrated progress in improving protection for victims of trafficking during the year. The Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare (MLSW) and Immigration Department cooperated with IOM, UNIAP, and a local [[NGO]] to provide victim assistance. The MLSW continued operating a small transit center in Vientiane. Victims not wanting to return home are referred to a long-term shelter run by the [[Lao Women’s Union]] or to a local NGO. Over the last year, 280 formally identified victims of cross border trafficking were repatriated to Laos from Thailand and an additional 21 were repatriated in 2008. Approximately 100 victims are currently residing in rehabilitation centers in Thailand. The Lao government provided medical services, counseling, vocational training, and employment services for victims in its transit shelter in Vientiane and at the Lao Women’s Union shelter. The government actively encouraged victims to participate in investigations and prosecutions of traffickers. As of January 2007, the Lao government stopped requiring exit permits for citizens to travel abroad, which eliminated the potential for penalizing illegal migrants and trafficking victims, through fines, upon their return. Government instructions against fining, and the removal of the legal basis for those fines, effectively reduced financial penalties faced by victims. The government provided land to an NGO for a new shelter and transit center for trafficking victims in Savannakhet in 2007 and it continued to provide office space and staff to assist IOM’s programs.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The Lao government increased efforts to prevent trafficking in persons with assistance from international organizations and civil society. For example, the MLSW worked with UNICEF to set up awareness-raising billboards near border checkpoints and larger cities. Also, in December 2007, the Lao Youth Union held a day-long event with workshops, puppet shows, and plays to address child trafficking. The event was led by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense who spoke about the dangers of trafficking. The government completed its national action plan to combat trafficking in July 2007. The Government of Laos demonstrated some efforts to reduce demand for commercial sex acts through periodic raids of nightclubs and discos used as fronts for [[commercial sex]]. In October and November 2007, police shut down bars and entertainment venues used for commercial sexual activities in [[Luang Prabang]]. A general increase in tourism in Laos and a concomitant probable rise in [[child sex tourism]] in the region have attracted the attention of Lao authorities who seek to prevent child sex tourism from taking root. [[Vientiane Province]] established a task force on child sex tourism in December 2007 to coordinate efforts between the authorities and the tourism sector. The government and NGOs hosted several seminars to train tourism sector employees, including taxi drivers, on how to report suspicious behavior. Tourism police received training on guidelines drafted in July 2007 aimed at combating sex tourism and identifying potential victims. Many major international hotels in Vientiane and Luang Prabang prominently displayed posters created by international NGOs warning about child sex tourism.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

'''''I Stared at the Night of the City''''' is a Kurdish [[novel]] by writer ''[[Bachtyar Ali]]'' (usually spelt Bakhtiyar Ali in English) translated into English by Kareem Abdulrahman in 2016. Set at the turn of the 21st century in Iraqi Kurdistan, the multi-narrator novel explores the relationship between an emerging political elite and intellectuals in contemporary Iraqi Kurdistan, portraying the Kurdish authorities' increasing authoritarian tendencies.It is the first Kurdish novel to be translated into English.

The novel became best-seller in Iraqi Kurdistan in 2008. It was published in Kurdish under the title of '''''Ghazalnus w Baghakani Khayal''''' '''''غەزەلنوس و باغەکانی خەیاڵ'''''.

==Outline==
The lead character in the novel is a poet, Ghazalnus, whose outlook is in stark contrast with that of a powerful politician, nicknamed the Baron of Imagination. The Baron has his own scheme, to construct a beautiful district, “a mini-paradise”, and he approaches the town’s poets and intellectuals to help him with the design of the project. This is a satirical reference to the Kurdish authorities’ liking for extravagant schemes, such as high-security residential areas and hotels, on which they spend public money, while failing to address essential political and social problems. Yet, he opposes the idea of artists and writers exploring taboo subjects - such as unresolved murders and corruption.&lt;ref name="ekurd.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2008/12/independentstate2581.htm|title=A Kurdish imagination-Ghazalnus and the Gardens of Imagination |author=Bakhtyar Ali|website=ekurd.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the multi-layered novel, a group of like-minded friends, led by a poet, go on an odyssey to find the bodies of two lovers killed by the authorities. The plot features elements of fantasy: the poet discovers a land that turns into an infinite garden at night, a group of women living in a shelter to escape domestic violence weave the world's biggest carpet, and a Hollywood film buff leads a group of blind children on an imaginary sea journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7535854.stm|title=BBC NEWS - World - Middle East - Kurdish novel re-writes rules|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Each chapter of the novel has a different [[narrator]], and usually there are thematic and chronological connections between chapters.

==Characters==
Many of the characters in this novel and other works by Ali have significant names. Here, many of them have more than one name.&lt;ref name="ekurd.net"/&gt;

The path on the left is dark and rough, while the path on the right is bright and clear.|'''At The Parting Of The Ways'''—A cartoon from the May, 1919 IWW periodical ''One Big Union'' shows a worker, representing the working class, choosing between a path of craft unionism towards the AFL slogan, "A Fair Day's Pay for a Fair Day's Work," and a path of industrial unionism towards the IWW slogan, "Abolition of the Wage System."]]
The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) is a union of wage workers which [[First Convention of the Industrial Workers of the World|was formed]] in [[Chicago]] in 1905 by militant unionists and their supporters due to anger over the conservatism, philosophy, and [[Craft unionism|craft-based structure]] of the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL). Throughout the early part of the Twentieth century the '''philosophy and tactics of the Industrial Workers of the World''' [[Labor federation competition in the U.S.|were frequently in direct conflict]] with those of the American Federation of Labor (forerunner of the [[AFL-CIO]]) concerning the best ways to organize workers, and how to best improve the society in which they toiled. The AFL had one guiding principle—"pure and simple trade unionism", often summarized with the slogan "[[A fair day's wage for a fair day's work|a fair day's pay for a fair day's work]]."&lt;ref name="Bohn1912"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bohn | first = William E. | year = 1912 | title = The Survey: social, charitable, civic: a journal of constructive philanthropy | volume = Volume 28, "The Industrial Workers of the World" | publisher = Charity Organization Society of the City of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IWW embraced two guiding principles, fighting like the AFL for better wages, hours, and conditions, but also promoting an eventual, permanent solution to the problems of strikes, injunctions, [[Bullpen#Response to labor unrest (United States)|bull pens]], and union [[strikebreaker|scabbing]].{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=138}}

The AFL and the IWW (whose members are referred to as Wobblies) had very different ideas about the ideal union structure. While the AFL primarily [[Craft unionism|organized workers into their respective crafts]], the IWW was created as an [[Industrial unionism|industrial union]] – placing all workers in a factory, mine, mill, or other place of business into the same industrial organization. The IWW also promotes the class-based concept of [[One Big Union (concept)|One Big Union]].

The IWW was formed by militant unionists, socialists, anarchists, and other labor radicals who believed that the great mass of workers are exploited by, and are in an economic struggle with, an employing class. The IWW employed a great [[diversity of tactics]] aimed at organizing all workers as a class, seeking greater economic justice on the job and, ultimately, the overthrow of the wage system which they believe is most responsible for keeping workers in subjugation. Such tactics are generally described as [[direct action]], which is distinguished from other types of reform efforts such as electoral politics. IWW members believe that change accomplished via politics depends upon appeal to members of a ruling class who derive benefit from the subservient quiescence of the working class.

While other unions (such as the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]]) adopted form and tactics—notably, industrial unionism and the sitdown strike—which were developed or pioneered by the IWW, labor laws passed by legislatures have sought to steadily erode the range and diversity of methods employed by all labor organizations. Confronted with such obstacles, militant IWW members tend to believe in a return to a union philosophy that was common a century ago, in which unjust labor laws are challenged directly by union actions, rather than accepted as a framework within which the union must operate.

==Wobbly understanding of the world==
[[File:One Big Union.jpg|left|180px|thumb|alt=Cartoon of a man climbing over a hill, reaching skyward, with factories in the background. Surrounding the cartoon is the text, "The IWW is coming! Join the One Big Union"|[[One Big Union (concept)|One Big Union]] sticker]]

By 1912, after a number of defections and splits, the IWW numbered some twenty-five thousand, much smaller than many of its rival unions. But the IWW's influence was already outsized. The [[Commission on Industrial Relations|Congressional Commission on Industrial Relations]] noted in 1916 that "as a 'spirit and vocabulary' [the IWW] permeates to a large extent enormous masses of workers..."{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=147}} Wobbly activists were those workers who not only reacted to economic forces, but who spent a considerable amount of time thinking, debating, and educating their co-workers about the impact of such forces upon society. [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]] observed, "Wherever, in the West, there is an IWW local, you will find an intellectual center... a place where men read philosophy, economics, the latest plays, novels; where art and poetry are discussed, and international politics."{{sfnp|Brundage|1994|p=4}}

The IWW printed hundreds of thousands of leaflets, promoted Industrial Education Clubs, and organized Propaganda Leagues.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=148}} Stickered slogans, referred to as "[[silent agitators]]", were printed by the million, and made available by the thousand. IWW libraries in union halls made available to any worker not only the organization's publications, but also practical topics about machinery and production, as well as classic works of scientists, theoreticians, and philosophers.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=151}} Knowledge and experience were likewise shared—new members were sometimes invited to chair meetings, not just to share the experience, but to initiate them into the community. Indeed, a favorite Wobbly answer to the question, who are your leaders, was the united response, we are all leaders.

Wobblies believed not only that it took a working person to understand the needs of the workers, but in order to lead, that person must also be an educated worker.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=148}} IWW publications seemed to enjoy reporting on "the amazement shown by college professors who heard Wobbly speakers deliver talks upon a wide variety of subjects and reveal a remarkable understanding of complex economic and social questions."{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=148}} By the time of the organization's founding in 1905, inquisitive workers already had [[Labor federation competition in the United States#History|a wide variety of union experiences and traditions]] to consider. In coming together as an organization, then, it is perhaps not surprising that the clash of ideas among IWW members resulted in passionate debate and an eventual winnowing of philosophies over several decades of evolution.

===Inspiration===
Where did initial inspirations for the Wobbly philosophy come from? Historian [[Melvyn Dubofsky]] is worth quoting at length:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Wobblies ... took their basic concepts from others: from [[Karl Marx|Marx]] the concepts of labor value, commodity value, surplus value, and class struggle; from [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] the idea of organic evolution and the struggle for survival as a paradigm for social evolution and the survival of the fittest class; from [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]] and the anarchists the "propaganda of the deed"'''*''' and the idea of direct action; and from [[Georges Sorel|Sorel]] the notion of the "militant minority." Hence, IWW beliefs became a peculiar amalgam of Marxism and Darwinism, anarchism and syndicalism — all overlaid with a singularly American patina.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=86}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Bill haywood headshot side.jpg|thumb|120px|alt=A man wearing a bowler cap, in profile.|[[Bill Haywood]]]]
However, Dubofsky also identifies American traditions "dating back to the era of Jefferson and Jackson" from which the Wobblies derived inspiration, particularly the concepts of a society divided into "[[Producerism|producers and nonproducers]], productive classes and parasites."{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=86}} Paul Brissenden likewise stated that, "[t]he main ideas of I.W.W.-ism—certainly of the I.W.W.-ism of the first few years after 1905—were of American origin, not French, as is commonly supposed.{{sfnp|Brissenden|1919|p=53}}

Wobblies sought to familiarize theoretical terminology for a worker audience of varied educative experience. A [[Proletariat|proletarian]] became a [[Wobbly lingo#Prole|prole]], and a [[Plutocracy|plutocrat]] was a [[Wobbly lingo#Plutes|plute]]. Bill Haywood, in particular, had the ability to translate complex economic theories into simple ideas that resonated with working people. He would frequently preface his speeches with the statement, "Tonight I am going to speak on the class struggle and I am going to make it so plain that even a lawyer can understand it."{{sfnp|Carlson|1983|p=146}} The Marxian concept of [[surplus value]], Haywood conveyed simply as "unpaid labor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Haywood | first = Bill | date = June 1966 | origyear = 1929 | title = The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood | publisher = International Publishers | page = 286}}&lt;/ref&gt; He distilled the voluminous work of Karl Marx into a simple observation, "If one man has a dollar he didn't work for, some other man worked for a dollar he didn't get."{{sfnp|Carlson|1983|p=146}}

[[Philip S. Foner]] disagreed with Dubofsky on this one point, stating, "[t]he I.W.W. did not, as did many, if not all, anarchists, advocate '[[propaganda of the deed]]'."{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=166}} [[Philip Taft|Taft]] and Ross likewise appear to disagree with Dubofsky, stating in more general terms, "violence in labor disputes was seldom inspired by the doctrine of 'propaganda by the deed,' whose self-defeating nature convinced many of its exponents of its fallacy."&lt;ref name="Philip Ross 1969"&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, "American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome," The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed. Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference may depend upon how 'propaganda of the deed' is defined.

==The question of political action==
By the time of the 1905 founding of the Industrial Workers of the World, the question of whether unionized workers could secure significant change by political actions of their unions had been in contention for some decades. The question had split the [[National Labor Union]] in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Grob | first = Gerald N. | year = 1969 | title = Workers and Utopia: a Study of Ideological Conflict in the American Labor Movement 1865-1900 | pages = 26–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It created divisions between the membership and the leadership of the [[Knights of Labor]], with the leaders favoring various political agendas including Greenbackism, socialism, and land reform.{{sfnp|Rayback|1966|p=146}} Labor historian [[Joseph Rayback]] believed that [[Labor federation competition in the U.S.#Difficult choices in the 1890s|significant losses for organized labor in the 1890s]] pointed the way toward either socialism, or industrial unionism in order to maintain organized labor's momentum.{{sfnp|Rayback|1966|p=197}}

Yet [[Samuel Gompers]], leader of the [[American Federation of Labor]], opposed both courses of action. He and John Mitchell, head of the [[United Mine Workers]], joined an alliance of conservative union leaders and liberal business men in forming the [[National Civic Federation]] (NCF).{{sfnp|Rayback|1966|p=210}} That organization's critics on the left believed that its goals were to suppress sympathy strikes, and to replace traditional expressions of working class solidarity with binding national trade agreements and arbitration of disputes.{{sfnp|Brundage|1994|p=147}}

By 1905, the NLU was history, and the Knights of Labor mostly a memory. Mitchell and Gompers of the AFL were beginning to build an alliance with the Democratic Party.{{sfnp|Buhle|1999|p=62}} While the focus upon political alliance by the AFL (at the perceived cost of class solidarity) was just one aspect of the differing union philosophies, it was a significant one. The formation of the Industrial Workers of the World was in many ways a direct response to the conservatism of the AFL, and its perceived failure to respond to the needs of western miners, lumbermen, and others. However, the political question would likewise play a central role in the internal disputes, and in the eventual evolution of the IWW itself.

==Early philosophy a compromise==
At [[First Convention of the Industrial Workers of the World|its opening convention]], the Industrial Workers of the World exhibited a "spirit of unity." Although nearly all of the delegates were committed to some form of Socialist politics, there were some significant philosophical differences just under the surface.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|pp=47, 62}} Western Federation of Miners members and other union veterans wanted the participation of the two Socialist parties, the [[Socialist Labor Party]] (SLP) and the [[Socialist Party]], in spite of longstanding animosity between these two political organizations. However, the veteran labor activists did not wish to commit to any particular political party. Nonetheless, some of the Socialists in both camps assumed that an endorsement would be forthcoming.

The IWW Constitution and Preamble resulting from the 1905 convention were essentially a compromise which papered over these, and other differences.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|pp=44-49}} Furthermore, while the SLP viewed organized labor as a mere adjunct to Socialist Labor Party politics, the Socialist Party was divided over whether the AFL, or the new IWW should be the proper vehicle to carry the labor banner of socialism.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=44}} As a result, many Socialists actually opposed the IWW from the outset.

The early IWW experienced [[Industrial Workers of the World organizational evolution|numerous divisions and splits]] during the period from 1905 to approximately 1930. It also suffered repression by business and government entities during this period. These experiences had a profound effect on the philosophy and tactics of the organization that survived.

==IWW versus the AFL==
{{main|Labor federation competition in the United States}}

In spite of the varied philosophies of the participants at the first IWW convention, there were a few compelling concerns which united all. Nearly all who attended acknowledged an "irrepressible conflict" between capital and labor.{{sfnp|Brissenden|1919|p=77}} Nearly all could be described as adherents of industrial unionism, as opposed to the craft unionism of the American Federation of Labor.{{sfnp|Brissenden|1919|p=78}} Acknowledging the common practice of AFL craft unions crossing each other's picket lines, the IWW adopted the WFM's description of the AFL as the "American Separation of Labor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cahn | first = William | year = 1972 | title = A Pictorial History of American Labor | page = 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the limitations of organizing by craft, the IWW criticized the AFL for emphasizing common interests between labor and capital, and for [[Labor aristocracy#Criticism of unions of elite workers|organizing only elite workers]] rather than acknowledging the needs of the entire working class.{{sfnp|Brissenden|1919|p=84}}

[[File:Gompers-Samuel-LOC.jpg|thumb|140px|right|alt=Portrait of a man.|Samuel Gompers, head of the American Federation of Labor]]
The AFL was bitterly attacked by speakers who organized the conference, such that many would have been pleased if the federation (although not necessarily its constituent unions) would simply cease to exist.{{sfnp|Brissenden|1919|p=65}} Samuel Gompers responded by declaring that the IWW's organizers were "trying to divert, pervert, and disrupt the labor movement of the country," describing them as "pirates" and "kangaroos."{{sfnp|Brissenden|1919|p=65}} Calling the AFL outdated was "inexcusably ignorant and maliciously false," said Gompers.{{sfnp|Brissenden|1919|p=90}} Referring to the birth of the IWW, Gompers commented that "[t]he mountain labored and brought forth a mouse, and a very silly little mouse at that... historians will record the Chicago [founding of the IWW] as the most vapid and ridiculous in the annals of those who presume to speak in the name of labor..."{{sfnp|Brissenden|1919|p=106}}

Gompers warned all AFL affiliates not to cooperate with IWW members, and told AFL members not to support IWW strikes. Permission was granted to cross IWW picket lines. Although the AFL had offered some support to the Western Federation of Miners in the aftermath of the [[Colorado Labor Wars]], that assistance was discontinued because of WFM affiliation with the IWW.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|pp=51-52}} A number of AFL affiliates—machinists, carpenters, hat makers, leatherworkers, and others—decreed that any individual with an IWW card would not be allowed to work in their industries.{{sfnp|Brissenden|1919|p=118}}

The IWW fought for workers' rights somewhat differently from the AFL. [[Staughton Lynd]] described the IWW as "devoting itself to struggles around demands, rather than negotiating contracts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lynd | first = Staughton | year = 1992 | title = Solidarity Unionism: Rebuilding the Labor Movement from Below | publisher = Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company | page = 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Buhle]] Lauds the idealism and creativity of the IWW, while asserting that "the AFL could not claim a single cultural contribution of note."{{sfnp|Buhle|1999|pp=12, 16, 66}} [[Melvyn Dubofsky]] described the AFL "[growing] fat while neglecting millions of laborers doomed to lives of misery and want", and the IWW offering to do what the AFL declined to do by giving hope to those neglected.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=6}} Yet Dubofsky believed he saw a contradiction between the IWW's goal of a better society, and the desires of its individual members for an improved life. As workers managed to improve their own lives, he theorized, they would have less interest in an improved society.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|pp=270-272}} And, the IWW was up against "flexible and sophisticated adversaries..."{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=271}} Those adversaries, as often as not, included the AFL.

==The IWW philosophy evolves==
The IWW organized many who were "left out" of American society, including "timber beasts, hobo harvesters, itinerant construction workers, exploited eastern and southern European immigrants, racially excluded African Americans, Mexicans, and Asian Americans."{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=84}} Due to feelings of alienation and impotence, these workers embraced radical theories aimed at disrupting and replacing the established social order.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=85}} The IWW maintained low initiation fees and dues, allowed universal transfer of union cards, and disdained apprenticeships in order to attract the lower strata of working society.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=85}}

As a result of the splits and de facto purges, the IWW distilled a core set of beliefs and practices. It eschewed political entanglements for revolutionary industrial unionism. the Wobblies of the IWW sought to "comprehend the nature and dynamics of capitalist society and through increased knowledge, as well as revolutionary activism, to develop a better system for the organization and functioning of the American economy."{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=84}}

===Two guiding principles===
Labor Historian Melvyn Dubofsky has written that the IWW held "an instinctive distaste for the world as it was, as well as hope for the creation of a completely new world." Yet in addition to a belief in eventual revolution, the IWW "constantly sought opportunities to improve the immediate circumstances of its members."{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=88}}

Marxist Labor Historian [[Philip S. Foner]] identifies the same points in the manifesto which called the labor activists to the founding conference in 1905. On the back of each manifesto was printed a declaration of the two requirements for any labor organization to properly represent the workers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
First -- It must combine the wage workers in such a way that it can most successfully fight the battles and protect the interests of the working people of to-day in their struggles for fewer hours, more wages and better conditions.

Secondly -- It must offer a final solution of the labor problem -- an emancipation from strikes, injunctions and bull-pens.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=18}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

IWW co-founders Father [[Thomas J. Hagerty]] and [[William Trautmann]] continued promoting these two essential goals in their 1911 pamphlet, ''One Big Union''. The IWW needed to "combine the wage-workers in such a way that it can most successfully fight the battles and protect the interests of the workers of today in their struggles for fewer hours of toil, more wages and better conditions," and it also "must offer a final solution of the labor problem—an emancipation from strikes, injunctions, bull-pens, and scabbing of one against the other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hagerty | first1 = Thomas J. | last2 = Trautmann | first2 = W. E. | year = 1911 | title = One Big Union: An Outline of a Possible Industrial Organization of the Working Class, with Chart | edition = 1st | publisher = Charles H. Kerr &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For and against the system===
Historian Daniel R. Fusfeld referred to the conflicting labor philosophies held by the AFL and its rivals as job-consciousness (the AFL), and class-consciousness (organizations such as the [[Knights of Labor]] and the IWW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fusfeld | first = Daniel R. | year = 1985 | title = The Rise and Repression of Radical Labor | page = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These philosophies resulted in oppositional alignment in regards to government.

In ''Taking Care of Business'', Paul Buhle wrote that the AFL-affiliated United Mine Workers President John Mitchell declared in 1903, "The trade union movement in this country can make progress only by identifying itself with the state." ... [Meanwhile, the] new National Civic Federation (which was supported by the AFL) ... sought to promote labor peace (on the terms of the employers, critics claimed) and to make class consciousness and class struggle obsolete.{{sfnp|Buhle|1999|pp=61-62}} While the AFL thus became more conservative, the IWW saw itself as a revolutionary organization dedicated to the "Abolition of the wage system."&lt;ref name="workerseducation1908"&gt;''[http://www.workerseducation.org/crutch/constitution/1908const.html Preamble and Constitution of the Industrial Workers of the World]'', Amended by Convention, 1908—Ratified by Referendum Vote, 1908, retrieved March 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political parties and union===
While the AFL's Mitchell and Gompers nurtured their alliance with the Democrats,{{sfnp|Buhle|1999|p=62}} the IWW changed its Constitution in 1908 to prohibit just such alliances. The 1908 Constitution states, "to the end of promoting industrial unity and of securing necessary discipline within the organization, the I. W. W. refuses all alliances, direct or indirect, with existing political parties or anti-political sects..."&lt;ref name="workerseducation1908"/&gt; This language is essentially unchanged in the 2011 IWW Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iww.org/en/culture/official Preamble, Constitution, &amp; General Bylaws of the Industrial Workers of the World], As Amended Through January 1, 2011, retrieved 3-13-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The prohibition on alliances with "anti-political sects" is noteworthy. According to [[Verity Burgmann]] and others, the Chicago IWW was "non-political" rather than "anti-political." [[Joseph R. Conlin]] believes the deletion of a political clause from the Preamble in 1908 is only half the story; in 1911 the IWW rejected an amendment to the Preamble that referred to "the futility of political action."&lt;ref&gt;[[Verity Burgmann]], ''[http://www.historycooperative.org/proceedings/asslh2/burgmann.html The IWW in International Perspective: comparing the North American and Australasian Wobblies]'', Australian Society for the Study of Labour History, 2007, quoting Conlin, Bread and Roses Too, page 35. retrieved March 22, 2009. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206164928/http://www.historycooperative.org/proceedings/asslh2/burgmann.html |date=December 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the ban on political involvement only went so far (presumably, banning any political or anti-political alliances ''in the name of the union''), and the balance of the IWW's membership saw nothing to be gained by outright hostility toward political action.

Writing of the IWW's history through 1917, Foner (who, as a Marxist historian ''favored'' political action) noted that while most Wobblies disdained the ballot, several IWW leaders, individual members, and even entire locals did not necessarily reject politics, and some even participated in election campaigns. While offering skepticism about their accomplishing anything worthwhile, ''[[Solidarity (U.S. newspaper)|Solidarity]]'' nonetheless commented that there was room for such members in the industrial union movement, since individual members had a right to differing views.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=169}} Elaborating on this circumstance, [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]] wrote in the ''[[Industrial Worker]]'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A working man may be an anarchist or a socialist, a Catholic or a Protestant, a republican or a democrat, but subscribing to the Preamble of the I.W.W. he is eligible for membership.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=170}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===On war===
[[File:IWW anti-conscription poster 1916.jpg|thumb|150px|right|alt="To arms! Capitalists, parsons, politicians, landlords, newspaper editors and other stay-at-home patriots. Your country needs YOU in the trenches! Workers, follow your masters."|The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in Australia published this anti-conscription poster in 1916.]]

While the AFL identified with, and made accommodations for the benefit of government, the IWW was ardently opposed to what it viewed as capitalist wars. [[World War I]] saw "Charles Schwab of Bethlehem Steel heralding the day when labor would rule the world and Samuel Gompers edging rapidly toward the businessman's creed of maximum production..."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Rodgers, The Work Ethic in Industrial America, 1850-1920, 1974-79, page 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The IWW opposed the war effort.

[[Bill Haywood|Big Bill Haywood]] described in his autobiography how the IWW issued stickers, which the IWW called [[silent agitators]], to propagandize against the war. The stickers declared, "Don't be a soldier, be a man. Join the I.W.W. and fight on the job for yourself and [[Working class|your class]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Haywood | first = William D. | year = 1929 | title = The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood | page = 294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IWW's opposition to the war led to enmity and, reportedly, behind the scenes attacks from the AFL's Samuel Gompers. In 1919, the year after the end of the war, the AFL seemed to have second thoughts, concluding that works committees of the war years were "a snare and a cooptation plan."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Rodgers, The Work Ethic in Industrial America, 1850-1920, 1974-79, page 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately by this time, many IWW leaders had been deported or were in prison for the IWW's anti-war pronouncements.

===IWW ideology and socialism===
Melvyn Dubofsky notes that Wobbly ideology and Socialist party doctrine both opposed capitalism and advocated something better, but beyond that, they "conflicted more than they agreed."{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=96}} For nearly a decade, Bill Haywood tried to bridge the gap, acting as general secretary of the IWW, and as an officer of the Socialist Party. A fractious former hard rock miner, Haywood would tease audiences by telling them, "I'm a two gun man from the West, you know." After a moment to build the suspense, he would thrust hands into pockets, extracting a red IWW card with one hand, and a red Socialist card with the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dubofsky | first = Melvyn | year = 1987 | title = 'Big Bill' Haywood | publisher = Manchester University Press ND | page = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haywood considered both ideologies vital to the cause of changing the economic system, frequently describing Wobblyism as "socialism with its working clothes on." Yet Haywood was embraced only by the left wing of the Socialist Party, and was eventually ejected from the Socialist Party's National Executive Committee by the conservative wing.

Generally speaking, American Socialists were interested in acceptance and gradual reform. Wobblies were more cynical about capitalism, and wanted a real revolution. Dubofsky believes, however, that IWW ideology was compatible with Syndicalism.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=96}}

===To be syndicalist, or not to be syndicalist?===
The ''New International Year Book'' for 1912 observed that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"the Industrial Workers of the World would place an industry in the hands of its workers, as would socialism; it would organize society without any government, as would anarchism; and it would bring about a social revolution by direct action of the workers, as would syndicalism. Nevertheless, it claims to be distinct from all three."&lt;ref&gt;Frank Moore Colby, editor, ''The New International Year Book, a compendium of the world's progress for the year 1912,'' Dodd, Mead and company, 1913, page 331&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While noting general conformance in the language of IWW and Socialist doctrines, [[Helen Marot]] clarified in 1914,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is the interpretation of the [IWW] preamble by individual members of the organization which has attached the Industrial Workers of the World to the [[Syndicalist]] rather than to the [[Socialist]] movement. The declaration in the manifesto that the workers should own and operate their own tools, and that they alone should enjoy the fruits of their labor, would mean, according to American Socialists, that all workers, through a political state, or regulated by it, would operate, own, and enjoy collectively all tools and the product of industry. [...] But [the Preamble], interpreted by the leaders of the Industrial Workers, is directly opposed to the political Socialism of America. It is the declaration of the Syndicalists that the new social order will not be dependent on political action or a political state, but it will be an industrial commonwealth in which all governmental functions as we know them to-day will have ceased to exist, and in which each industry will be controlled by the workers in it without external interference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Marot | first = Helen | year = 1914 | title = American labor unions | publisher = H. Holt and company | pages = 51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marot further notes that such classifications (Socialist or Syndicalist) are important to theorists, but not so important to organized labor itself.

Labor historian Philip S. Foner observed in 1997 that "virtually every scholar" who has studied the IWW considers it to be a type of syndicalist organization. Yet he likewise notes key differences.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=157}} For example, while European syndicalists operate within mainstream unions, the IWW has always displayed an antagonism toward, and disdain for existing [[craft unionism|craft based trade unions]] in the United States. This has led the IWW to embrace the concept of [[dual unionism]]. When [[William Z. Foster]] offered the IWW an opportunity to begin a European syndicalist style program of "[[boring from within]]" the AFL, the IWW rejected it. Foner concludes, therefore, that the IWW did not inherit its philosophy of revolutionary industrial unionism from French Syndicalism. However, he does also note similarities.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=157}} Foner believes that IWW members did learn about the organization's kinship with European syndicalist organizations through Wobbly publications, and thereby largely accepted the doctrines of syndicalism, especially after [[Bill Haywood]] brought back some ideas about syndicalist tactics from his 1910 visit to Europe.

Conlin suggested in 1969 that those who wish to understand the true nature of the IWW should discontinue referring to the IWW as syndicalist. He makes several points: the IWW did not like the term syndicalism; the revolutionary industrial unionism of the IWW had "distinctly different origins" than did the syndicalism of Europe; and, there were key differences between the philosophy of the Wobblies, and that of the syndicalists.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|pp=19-20}}

[[Ralph Chaplin]], IWW editor of ''[[Solidarity (U.S. newspaper)|Solidarity]]'' and later, of the ''[[Industrial Worker]]'', appears to have made similar points to those made by Joseph Conlin. Chaplin wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In spite of certain misleading surface similarities, which are unduly stressed by shallow observers, the European anarcho-syndicalist movement and the I.W.W. differ considerably in more than one particular. This was made inevitable by reason of the fact that the I.W.W. was the result of a later and more mature period of industrial development.

This accounts for the fact that European Syndicalism, unlike the I.W.W., is not organized into [[One Big Union (concept)|One Big Union]] on the basis of perfectly co-ordinated, centralized [[industrial unionism|industrial departments]]. It also accounts for the fact that the form of the I.W.W. is designed to serve not only as a powerful combative force in the everyday class struggle, but also as the structure of the new society both as regards production and administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chaplin | first = Ralph | year = 1985 | origyear = 1933 | title = The General Strike | url = http://www.iww.org/en/culture/official/strike/strike4.shtml | type = Pamphlet | publisher = Industrial Workers of the World | accessdate = April 8, 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081006192957/http://www.iww.org/en/culture/official/strike/strike4.shtml | archivedate = October 6, 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1981 Conlin gave up the "non-syndicalist" cause as a semantic exercise, while simultaneously complimenting Dubofsky for his superior treatment of the IWW's American roots.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|pp=19-20}}

===Anarchist swing?===
Others note that the IWW draws upon socialist and anarchist traditions. In 1921, [[Robert Hoxie]], author of ''Trade Unionism in the United States'', referred to the IWW as "quasi anarchistic."{{sfnp|Hoxie|Hoxie|Fine|1921|p=49}} Just two years earlier, in 1919, [[Paul Frederick Brissenden]] described the revolutionary industrial unionism of the IWW as industrial unionism "animated and guided by the revolutionary (socialist or anarchist) spirit..."{{sfnp|Brissenden|1919|p=27}}

Brissenden wrote, "The anarchistic element was weak in 1905..."{{sfnp|Brissenden|1919|p=109}} [[Vincent St. John]] recalled in 1914, "there were so few anarchists in the first convention that there was very little need to classify them."{{sfnp|Brissenden|1919|p=77}} But Brissenden also observed that from its inception in 1905, the IWW "began a sharp swing ... from socialist industrial unionism to [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] industrial unionism."{{sfnp|Brissenden|1919|p=45}} A significant milestone in this swing, in which the "anarchistic leanings of the direct-actionist wing of the organization"{{sfnp|Brissenden|1919|p=109}} came to the fore, occurred when the [[Industrial Workers of the World organizational evolution#1908 split|influence of the Socialist Labor Party was purged]] in 1908.

===Anarcho-syndicalism===
Wobblies have been called socialist, anarchist, and syndicalist. Some would argue that none of these fit well. Writing of French syndicalism in ''The revolutionary internationals, 1864-1943'', [[Milorad M. Drachkovitch]] offered the perception that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It did not occur to the syndicalists that the capitalist state, "eliminated" by the "expropriatory [[general strike]]", would be replaced by a new state with a new ruling class—the self-taught officials of the labor unions. It was only after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] that most French syndicalists, dropping the last vestiges of anarchist anti-statism, adopted the slogan ''au syndicat le pouvoir'', i.e., all power to the labor union, which of course meant all power to the union leaders. Syndicalism, without the anarchist prefix, thus eventually became one of the heretical variants of [[Leninism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Milorad M. Drachkovitch]], ''The revolutionary internationals, 1864-1943,'' Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, Stanford University Press, 1966, page 84&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The IWW had explicitly rejected Leninism by 1921.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|pp=264-265}} (Of course—perhaps unlike the French Syndicalists—the Wobbly perception of any perceived "centralizing" tactics by IWW leaders [[Industrial Workers of the World organizational evolution#Seeds of another split|split the organization on multiple occasions]]...)

For those who feel compelled to "classify" the modern IWW's revolutionary industrial unionism in some broader category, the term used by Brissenden—anarcho-syndicalism—seems to be the current category of choice. However, even Brissenden's use of the term anarcho-syndicalism (in 1919) was met with dismay in some IWW circles, with a writer in ''One Big Union Monthly'' calling such terms "very misleading."{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=166}}

A distinction should likewise be drawn between adopting tactics or principles from the anarchists, and ''actually being described as'' an anarchist organization. The IWW,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...made a special effort to distinguish itself from the anarchists, emphasizing repeatedly that the two had "entirely different organizations and concepts of solving the social problem."{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=166}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The contract question===
In 1912, William E. Bohn could write in ''The Survey'' that "all those who properly call themselves industrial unionists ... refuse to bind themselves by means of contracts with their employers. Believing, as they do, that there is an inevitable and continuous struggle between employers and employed, it seems to them that a contract is a truce with their natural enemy, a truce, moreover, which gives him all the advantage."&lt;ref name="Bohn1912"/&gt; Within two decades, based upon experience with other unions whose philosophies did not preclude undercutting embattled groups of industrial workers for the sake of securing their own contract, this would no longer be the case. The [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] began organizing with a moderated form of [[industrial unionism]] (Conlin describes the CIO as composed of "nonrevolutionary" industrial unions).{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=5}} And by 1938, having observed the burgeoning success of the CIO, even some branches of the IWW began to sign contracts with employers.

The IWW had believed that if workers did not retain the right to strike whenever called upon, then employers could whipsaw one group of workers against another. Moreover, timed contracts allowed employers to prepare for strikes, rendering such job actions less effective.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|pp=93-94}} The IWW's early attitude about labor contracts had mirrored that of the Western Federation of Miners: "The WFM never demanded a closed shop or an exclusive employment contract. It supported no apprenticeship rules, having no intention of restricting union membership. It wanted jobs for all, not merely for the organized few."{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=33}} WFM Secretary Treasurer Bill Haywood believed that in time of crisis the AFL "had always proved impotent to aid its affiliates, usually sacrificing them on the 'sacred altar of contract'."{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=41}} This view was shared by WFM President Charles Moyer, who told the 1903 WFM Convention, "It behooves us at all times to be free to take advantage of any opportunity to better our condition. Nothing affords the majority of corporations more satisfaction than to realize that they have placed you in a position where you are powerless to act for a period of years."{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=42}} According to Historian Melvyn Dubofsky, neither the WFM nor its successive offspring—the [[American Labor Union]] (ALU) and the IWW—accepted that a contract with employers was legally or morally binding, and all three organizations believed that workers could best see to their interests by retaining the ability to strike when necessary.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=42}}

However, employers used the no contract manifesto as an excuse not to meet with workers. Local media supported the employers, asking, what was the use of discussing grievances with members of an organization that refused a written agreement, if the workers were free to strike again the moment a dispute was settled?{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=378}} This became a familiar circumstance, and as a result, other unions were sometimes able to sign members that had once marched under the banner of the IWW.

From the Paterson strike until the rise of the Agricultural Workers Organization (AWO) in 1915, the IWW had organized successfully during labor struggles, but then had failed to hold its membership. As [[James P. Cannon]] would later write,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...the IWW attracted a remarkable selection of young revolutionary militants to its banner. As a union, the organization led many strikes which swelled the membership momentarily. But after the strikes were over, whether won or lost, stable union organization was not maintained. After every strike, the membership settled down again to the die-hard cadre united on principle.&lt;ref&gt;James P. Cannon, ''[http://www.iww.org/en/history/library/Cannon/iww/2 The IWW]'', Fourth International, Summer 1955. retrieved July 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This circumstance prompted a discussion in the IWW press of the question, "What's wrong with the IWW?"{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=472}}

The job delegate system of the AWO proved successful and, for a time, allowed the IWW to ignore the problem of failing to retain members. Rather than soap boxing to sign up workers between jobs, carefully chosen union members with card kits were sent into the fields to sign up others on the job. The results were a considerable improvement.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=474}} Between 1915 and 1917, the IWW's [[Agricultural Workers Organization]] (AWO) organized more than a hundred thousand migratory farm workers throughout the midwest and western United States.&lt;ref&gt;Henry E. McGuckin, ''Memoirs of a Wobbly,'' Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company, 1987, page 70&lt;/ref&gt; IWW members were routinely blacklisted from farm worker employment offices, prompting the IWW to advise job delegates to tear up their personal IWW cards in front of the boss to hold onto their own job. The AWO office would later provide a duplicate card.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=476}} But signing up significant numbers of workers only eased, and did not in any way solve the problem of membership losses resulting from the no contract philosophy.

The question of contract became an important factor that tended to divide members of the IWW from their leaders.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|pp=93-94}} The two principles of fighting for better wages, hours and conditions, and preparing for the ultimate triumph of labor often came into conflict. IWW members frequently chose the former, while their leadership often saw the latter principle as predominant.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|pp=93-94}} As Philip Foner put it, activities that were logical and necessary on the trade union front frequently had to be rejected because they conflicted with revolutionary aims.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=470}}

In ''Oil, Wheat &amp; Wobblies'', a book about the Industrial Workers of the World in Oklahoma, Nigel Anthony Sellars wrote that although the CIO "inherited the egalitarian traditions and syndicalist ideals" of the IWW, the CIO succeeded where the IWW had failed (in mass organizing of industrial unions) "in part because the newer organization did not repeat the Wobblies' mistakes, such as refusing to sign time contracts and rejecting political action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sellars | first = Nigel Anthony | year = 1998 | title = Oil, Wheat &amp; Wobblies: the Industrial Workers of the World in Oklahoma, 1905-1930 | publisher = University of Oklahoma Press | page = 189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IWW view of political action has not been much affected by such analysis. However, in the period of the CIO's impressive ascent, the IWW philosophy about contracts was beginning to evolve. In military terms, the contract eventually came to be viewed somewhat as the role of the infantry, in that ground captured must in some fashion become ground held.

There are two aspects of the contract question: official recognition of the union by the employer, and the labor contract itself. During its early years, the IWW rejected both.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=93}} Foner observed that the larger, stronger IWW locals were able to live with this circumstance, for they achieved recognition by force of numbers. However, weak IWW unions lost job control because hostile employers were not bound by contractual recognition, and the companies therefore resorted to hiring workers who were not IWW members.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=470}} Conlin observed, "[t]he issues of time contracts and union recognition proved to be the Wobblies' Achilles' heel every time they organized a successful strike."{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=204}} Foner concludes that, "ironically, while the refusal to sign contracts was justified, in part, as a means of keeping the capitalists off balance, experience proved that it had the opposite effect of enabling the employers to use it to their own advantage."{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=470}}

One example of membership loss and acquisition relating to the contract occurred in the Baltimore garment industry. By September 1913 the IWW had organized some of the largest garment shops in the city. During a fourteen-week strike, the IWW was undercut when the conservative AFL-affiliated [[United Garment Workers]] (UGW) brought in scab replacement workers. Shortly afterward, at their 1914 Nashville convention, a group of disenchanted UGW unionists split off to form the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America|Amalgamated Clothing Workers]] (ACW). The IWW was initially the largest of these three organizations in Baltimore. Yet in the three-way free-for-all that occurred there in 1916—a struggle characterized by union scabbing and threats—the IWW lost all of its membership in the district as a result of the other two unions bidding against each other for collective bargaining agreements.{{sfnp|Thompson|Murfin|1976|pp=98-99}}

Meanwhile, IWW local unions that did sign contracts had their charters pulled. That was the fate of an IWW branch in Great Falls, Montana, in 1912.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=137}} Other local organizations were forced to disaffiliate from the IWW, as did the Metal and Machinery Workers Industrial Union No. 440 in Cleveland, Ohio during the 1930s, when they elected to sign a contract with an employer.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=57}}

During the 1927 coal strike in Colorado, a challenge to the policy of refusing union recognition came from within the IWW, when IWW organizer Tom Conners replaced [[A.S. Embree]], who had been jailed for violating the state's anti-picketing policy. After a very successful strike that depleted the state's coal reserves, Conners foresaw the possibility of the State Industrial Commission recognizing the IWW. Conlin indicates that this was the first time such a challenge to the IWW's policy of "no contracts, no recognition" had been made from within. However, Embree and his followers opposed the move, and nothing came of it. While the miners gained from the strike, the IWW failed to do so.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=205}}

In 1938, the IWW Constitution was amended to allow industrial unions to adopt their own rules concerning contractual agreements.{{sfnp|Thompson|Murfin|1976|p=100}} A stipulation adopted in 1946 required that no such agreement could allow workers to engage in work that would undermine any strike.{{sfnp|Thompson|Murfin|1976|p=100}}

Staughton Lynd, a labor attorney, activist, and author of ''Solidarity Unionism'', has observed,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he critical question is not whether or not to have a contract. The critical question is what is in the contract. Ninety-nine percent of AFL-CIO contracts contain a no-strike clause, whereby labor gives up its self-activity, and a management prerogative clause, whereby management retains its ability to act unilaterally, for instance in closing plants. No contract is better than such a contract.&lt;ref&gt;Sarumathi Jayaraman, Immanuel Ness, ''The new urban immigrant workforce: innovative models for labor organizing,'' M.E. Sharpe, 2005, page 73&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====No-strike clause====
Contracts enforce "labor peace" through a clause that prohibits strikes for the duration of the contract. Some unions agree to a no-strike clause in exchange for a grievance arbitration provision, or some similar concession.&lt;ref name="uslegal1"&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/n/no-strike-clause/ "No Strike Clause Law &amp; Legal Definition"] USLegal.com. retrieved March 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Not all labor contracts have no-strike clauses. On some occasions, no-strike clauses have become a contract issue in dispute, with workers refusing to accept the no-strike clause, and employers refusing to agree to a contract without same.

In 2005, Staughton Lynd discussed the historical and legal circumstances relating to the no-strike clause at the IWW's centenary in [[Chicago, Illinois]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When [[John L. Lewis]], [[Philip Murray]], and other men of power in the new [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] negotiated the first contracts for auto workers and steelworkers, these contracts, even if only a few pages long, typically contained a no-strike clause. All workers in a given workplace were now prohibited from striking as particular crafts had been before. This remains the situation today.

Nothing in labor law required a no-strike clause. Indeed, the drafters of the original [[National Labor Relations Act]] (or Wagner Act) went out of their way to ensure that the law would not be used to curtail the right to strike. Not only does federal labor law affirm the right "to engage in . . . concerted activities for the purpose of . . . mutual aid or protection"; even as amended by the [[Taft–Hartley Act]] of 1947, Section 502 of what is now called the Labor Management Relations Act declares:

:Nothing in this Act shall be construed to require an individual employee to render labor or service without his consent, nor shall anything in this Act be construed to make the quitting of his labor by an individual employee an illegal act; nor shall any court issue any process to compel the performance by an individual employee of such labor or service, without his consent; nor shall the quitting of work by an employee or employees in good faith because of abnormally dangerous conditions for work at the place of employment of such employee or employees be deemed a strike under this chapter[;]

and for good measure, the drafters added in Section 13 of the NLRA, now section 163 of the LMRA: "Nothing in this Act, except as specifically provided for herein, shall be construed so as either to interfere with or impede or diminish in any way the right to strike . . . ."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iww.org/en/node/1043 "Chicago, IWW Centenary - Staughton Lynd’s remarks on Solidarity Unionism"]  retrieved March 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the NLRA protects the right to strike, some strikes do not have legal protection. For example, "[i]f a collective bargaining agreement contains a no-strike clause (the union agrees not to go on strike while the contract is in effect), a strike during the life of the contract would not be protected. The strikers could be fired."&lt;ref name="uslegal1"/&gt; Some no-strike clauses, however, have qualifications which protect the workers, for example, if they refuse to perform assigned work that has been struck by other workers.

==IWW tactics and action==

===Direct action===
{{Main|direct action}}

The Industrial Workers of the World inherited the concept of economic action (as opposed to political action), in part, from the [[American Labor Union]]. Melvyn Dubofsky associates economic action with what the IWW would later call direct action.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=41}} The IWW first mentioned the term "direct action" in a Wobbly publication in reference to a Chicago strike conducted in 1910.{{sfnp|Thompson|Murfin|1976|p=46}} In this instance the specific methods of direct action are not recorded, but the account referred to a successful strike against Hansel &amp; Elcock Construction which was followed by former strikers persuading former strike breakers to "dismiss themselves" from the job.{{sfnp|Thompson|Murfin|1976|p=46}}

Direct action in the labor movement initially referred to the actions taken by workers for themselves, as opposed to actions taken in their name by legislative or other representatives.{{sfnp|Thompson|Murfin|1976|p=82}} For example, dual-card IWW members have been known to advocate direct action on the shop floor to force employers to provide safer working conditions, to be more responsive to workers' demands, and to avoid speedup situations.{{sfnp|Thompson|Murfin|1976|p=218}} However, the expression has sometimes "been contorted to cover all the implications of mayhem and destruction..."{{sfnp|Thompson|Murfin|1976|p=82}} Some of the confusion may result from varying definitions offered by different Wobbly publications. The ''[[Industrial Worker]]'' described direct action as "any effort made directly for the purpose of getting more of the goods from the boss." The eastern U.S. IWW publication ''[[Solidarity (U.S. newspaper)|Solidarity]]'' defined direct action as "dealing directly with the boss through your labor union. The strike in its different forms, is the best known example of 'direct action'."{{sfnp|Foner|1997|pp=134-135}}

====Soapboxing and free speech fights====
{{Main|Free speech fights}}

Although lauded by civil libertarians as an important part of the struggles for civil and constitutional rights, the IWW's free speech fights were carried out for more concrete goals. If they weren't allowed to talk to workers, they wouldn't be able to organize workers.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=98}} Wobbly activists simultaneously demonstrated that direct action works, and that it was possible for members of the lower strata of society to challenge authority and, through determination and perseverance, to frequently win.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=98}}

The workers and the IWW had a common enemy in the communities that became free speech battlegrounds. These were the [[Wobbly lingo#Shark|job sharks]], agencies that controlled employment in agriculture and the timber industry.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=99}} The combination of sharks, anti-union employers, and hostile or indifferent communities kept wages low, and employment uncertain for many workers.

The attitude in some communities toward IWW members engaging in the fight for free speech is nicely characterized by an editorial in the ''San Diego Tribune'' on March 4, 1912:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hanging is none too good for them and they would be much better dead, for they are absolutely useless in the human economy. They are the waste material of creation and they should be drained off into the sewer of oblivion, there to rot in cold obstruction like any other excrement.{{sfnp|Brissenden|1919|p=264}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The strategy of the IWW during free speech fights was to put out a call for "footloose" workers to come to the community, and to challenge a no speaking ordinance simply by violating it. Wobblies would talk about the job, the unfairness of the system, or would simply read the Declaration of Independence, or the Bill of Rights to the U.S. Constitution. In violation of the law, they would get arrested. By filling the jails with workers, the IWW was able to put pressure on the community's taxpayers, who ultimately had to pay the bill for feeding and housing the prisoners. The taxpayers presumably had the power to avoid such expenses by forcing the local administration to change its policies, or to overturn the ordinance itself.

====Conventional strikes====
{{Main|Strike action}}

A primary goal of union is to improve the wages, hours, and working conditions of working people, and the strike, or threat of a strike is one mechanism by which that can be accomplished. However, the IWW also believe that the strike is a means by which working people can educate themselves to the issues of class struggle. Such education, according to the Wobblies, is necessary training in the effort to properly exercise the general strike, which (according to IWW theory) is the best means by which to establish an industrial democracy.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=140}}&lt;ref name="autogenerated1911"&gt;Bill Haywood, ''The General Strike'' (Chicago, n.d.), pamphlet, published by Industrial Workers of the World, from a New York City speech delivered March 16, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IWW has engaged in a significant number of celebrated strikes throughout its colorful history. Each is rich in its own way. During the Colorado coal strike of 1927, IWW organizers had the opportunity to apply many of the strategies and tactics they'd adopted during the previous decades.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=199}}

=====Colorado coal strike (a case study)=====
Joseph Conlin has written that the 1927 coal strike was a "unique, indeed critical event in the social and economic history of the West." First, it was a coal strike run by Wobblies, rather than the United Mine Workers. Second, many of the miners had a company union, yet still elected to strike under the IWW. Third, it had the first positive result for Colorado coal miners in sixty years of struggle.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=192}}{{sfnp|Margolis|Romero|1987|p=116}}

The IWW had editorially criticized the leadership of the United Mine Workers (UMW) during the 1913-14 strike which had led to the [[Ludlow Massacre]]. Their view: the miners had been "sold out" by "politicians" who had timidly refused to employ the full power of an aroused working class.{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|p=69}} The United Mine Workers responded by banning IWW card holders from membership in the UMW.{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|p=69}} Because the United Mine Workers had essentially left Colorado in defeat a decade earlier, the IWW began organizing Colorado coal miners in 1925. Organizer Frank Jurich was joined by A.S. Embree, a popular and very capable IWW organizer.{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|pp=69-70}} Embree had just come from prison, having been incarcerated on syndicalist charges. While in prison, Embree indicated his dedication to the cause. He had written, "The end in view [the revolution] is well worth striving for, but in the struggle itself lies the happiness of the fighter."{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=199}} Embree initially began organizing outlying camps to avoid company opposition.{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|p=70}}

In 1927 the IWW called for a three-day nationwide walkout to protest the execution of [[Sacco and Vanzetti]].{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|p=71}} While the United Mine Workers predicted the IWW's walkout would fail in Colorado, Sheriff Harry Capps of Huerfano County commented that "fully two-thirds of the miners in the [[Walsenburg, Colorado|[Walsenburg]]] district [are] members of the I.W.W."{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|p=72}} When the walkout occurred, out of a total 1,167 miners, 1,132 stayed off the job, and only 35 went to work.{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|p=72}} Under threat of injunction, the IWW leaders felt they'd demonstrated success, and they persuaded the miners to return to work one day early.{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|p=72}} Conlin wrote, "The tactical decision of the Wobblies was to give ground on this occasion to intensify organizing efforts for a statewide strike."{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=199}}

Organizing proceeded apace. In one mine, the Supervisor went to work one morning and discovered "Wobbly stickers pasted on every timber and cross beam in the place:'' 'Join the Wobblies, Join the Wobblies.'"'' There were IWW posters "from the bottom of the shaft clear to the working face."{{sfnp|Margolis|2005|p=31}}

IWW leader Kristin Svanum met in a mass meeting with 187 delegates from 43 of the state's 125 mines to work out the miners' demands.{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|p=73}}{{sfnp|Myers|2005a|p=132}} ''[[Industrial Solidarity]]'' declared, "These mass meetings [are] to be the legislative bodies of the strikers."{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|p=74}} The rank and file miners were given full veto power over every aspect of the pending strike. The miners elected a General Strike Committee, which had the power to appoint all other committees,{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|p=74}} with only miners eligible for committee membership—a policy that demonstrated "the democratic principles of the Wobblies."{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=199}} While Wobbly organizers conducted the meetings, they had no vote in the miners' decisions.{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|p=74}} The Wobblies were careful that the strike demands reflected only the immediate needs of the workers, rather than long range goals of the IWW.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=199}} IWW philosophy and economic analysis were communicated only passively through the printing of the union's Preamble on membership cards, on leaflets, and in personal conversations with organizers drawn from the rank and file.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=200}} For a long time, the Wobbly philosophy was based on the belief that organizing and developing solidarity constituted the best radical education for workers.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=200}} The perceptions expressed in the IWW Preamble coincided with the Colorado miners' personal experiences with capitalism, and also with their feelings about the United Mine Workers union which since 1914 had seemed to ignore their needs.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=200}}

All national groupings were represented on the General Strike Committee—"Mexican, Slav, Spanish, Greek, Anglo, Italian, and Negro."{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|p=74}}

There were so many different nationalities in the coal towns of Colorado due to corporate recruitment policy. After the coal strike of 1903-04, the companies intentionally recruited replacement miners who would have social, cultural, and language barriers to overcome before they could unite with other miners to form unions.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=195}}{{sfnp|Margolis|Romero|1987|pp=112-114}} But the IWW, always the champion of the immigrant and the ethnic worker, had readily overcome such challenges as early as the [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike]].

Docile immigrant workers may have been a boon to industry, but invariably, such workers were ruthlessly exploited. In the mines, yesterday's perplexed new arrival often became today's militant unionist.{{sfnp|Margolis|Romero|1987|p=113}}

Immigrants aroused by injustice became targets. The Colorado newspapers railed against foreign workers and, alternately, an alleged foreign, or a lower class philosophy. For example, IWW leaders were called "tramps with their pants pressed."{{sfnp|Myers|2005a|p=136}} The ''Denver Morning Post'' criticized the strikers' spelling, their speech, their dress, their personal hygiene, and their values.{{sfnp|Myers|2005a|p=136}} The IWW responded by promoting international and ethnic solidarity. Organizers with Spanish surnames played a vital role. The more loudly the coal operators objected, the quicker the Wobbly message circulated.&lt;ref&gt;Phil Goodstein, Richard Myers, Slaughter in Serene, The Columbine Coal Strike Reader, Colorado's First Columbine Strike, and The Columbine Mine Massacre, pub. Bread and Roses Workers' Cultural Center and Industrial Workers of the World, 2005, pages 110, 135-136&lt;/ref&gt;

The IWW was careful to follow the minutiae of Colorado law related to the pending strike, in an effort to keep the focus on the miners, rather than on the IWW itself. Nonetheless, the State Industrial Commission declared the pending strike illegal. This decision angered even established labor organizations who had not supported the strike up to that point. They considered it an affront to all of organized labor in Colorado.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=200}}

IWW organizers were arrested, beaten, and robbed.{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|pp=76-77}} Proclamations were passed by at least six city councils ordering the IWW to leave.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|pp=200-201}} IWW union halls were wrecked. Strike preparations proceeded unabated, and strike votes were held throughout the state. In Lafayette, so many people arrived at the meeting hall to endorse the pending strike that the vote was moved to the football field, and conducted under the headlights of trucks. The ''Denver Post'' estimated that 4,000 attended.{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|pp=76-77}}

Along with the coal companies, the state, and many local communities, the United Mine Workers came out publicly against the pending strike. But the strike was called in spite of the opposition, and miners walked. After two weeks of the Wobbly led strike, 113 Colorado coal mines had closed, and just 12 mines remained open.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Myers, Slaughter in Serene, The Columbine Coal Strike Reader, The Columbine Mine Massacre, pub. Bread and Roses Workers' Cultural Center and Industrial Workers of the World, 2005, page 132, from a report in the ''Denver Morning Post'', November 1, 1927, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Conlin declared it the most successful strike in Colorado's history.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=200}} The coal companies offered a non-negotiated pay increase of sixty-eight cents per day. This offer did not disrupt the strikers' motivation.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=200}}

With IWW guidance, the General Strike Committee instructed the miners to commit no violence.{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|p=77}} The strike saw auto caravans of five hundred strikers traveling in more than a hundred vehicles, touring struck communities to dispense donated food and other provisions. This not only spread the strike, it kept up the strikers' morale.{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|p=79}} All participants were searched by their leaders for liquor or firearms before each activity.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Sampson, Slaughter in Serene, The Columbine Coal Strike Reader, Hawk Over November, pub. Bread and Roses Workers' Cultural Center and Industrial Workers of the World, 2005, page 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Conlin quotes McClurg to observe that "Laws were broken, but selectively and with care."{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=201}} The state of Colorado banned picketing, but miners voted in mass meetings to ignore the state's ban.{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|p=77}} Colorado law outlawed red flags such as those long flown by the IWW, so the strikers carried American flags.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Myers, Slaughter in Serene, The Columbine Coal Strike Reader, pub. Bread and Roses Workers' Cultural Center and Industrial Workers of the World, 2005, page 140 and Appendix A&lt;/ref&gt; In a further declaration of non-violent intent, the IWW admonished strikers, "If anyone is going to be killed, let it be one of our men first."{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|p=77}}

The Columbine mine, one of the larger of the few mines still working, granted a fifty cent per day pay raise. The IWW saw this as one major coal company weakening, but announced that it was not enough.{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|p=79}} The Wobblies organized massive marches to the Columbine, numbering from 500 to 1,200 miners plus their families. They sometimes brought a five piece brass band, and they sang union songs, satirizing the company and the police.&lt;ref&gt;Phil Goodstein, Slaughter in Serene, The Columbine Coal Strike Reader, Colorado's First Columbine Strike, pub. Bread and Roses Workers' Cultural Center and Industrial Workers of the World, 2005, page 116&lt;/ref&gt;

In one surprising episode of "philosophical warfare" during the strike, the IWW made an attempt to establish a workers' cooperative for striking miners at an abandoned mine. Two coal mine operators sought to demonstrate that such cooperatives were impossible, and they issued a challenge to the IWW to follow through at their facilities. However, they insisted that the IWW had to post a state-required safety bond within 24 hours, before it could reopen the mines. Since the IWW wasn't able to post the bond within the designated period, the experiment was not pursued.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=206}}

Entire communities became organized during the 1927 strike, and they were capable of protracted militant action.{{sfnp|Margolis|Romero|1987|p=126}} However, a strike typically puts a dramatic strain on relationships within communities. Affected relationships are not just between strikers and business interests, or between strikers and non-strikers. During a coal strike, entire families are involved.{{sfnp|Myers|2005b|p=156}} One resident of a coal community spoke of the effect of the 1927 strike on students,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
You'd think the coal miner was the dirtiest reptile that walked the earth. Everybody was down on the coal miner when he went on strike ... And the teachers were against us. And they had their favorites. The scabs' boys were in there too and, of course, we had gangs just like they do today. And the teachers would side with the scabs' side. Why hells bells man, we had to do something! So we organized (Junior Wobblies) at school just to protect ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Margolis (sociologist)|Eric Margolis]] and Mary Romero, quoting Celeski, 1976, "The Greater Evil: The Role of Radical Unions in the End of Industrial Feudalism," Research in Social Policy, Volume 1, 1987, page 123&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The State of Colorado and local law enforcement began to arrest every strike leader that they could identify, on vagrancy or other trumped up charges. Many were deported from the state. In Trinidad, in Walsenberg, and elsewhere, members of strikers' families stepped forward to take the place of arrested leaders, and lead the strike.{{sfnp|Myers|2005b|pp=161-171}}

Seventy-five IWW members in the Trinidad jail conducted protests that featured bonfires. Prisoners in the Lafayette jail carried on incessant singing. When they were offered their freedom, they refused to leave. A group of prisoners in Erie persuaded their jailers that deputies in Utah and Wyoming received higher pay, had better working conditions, and worked shorter hours.{{sfnp|Myers|2005a|pp=134-135}} In Pueblo, the jail was secured by "200 deputies armed with tear bombs, machine guns, rifles, and fire engine pumpers."{{sfnp|McClurg|1963|p=82}}

Newspapers began calling for the governor to no longer withhold the "mailed fist", to strike hard and strike swiftly,&lt;ref&gt;''Denver Morning Post'' editorial, November 2, 1927, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; and for "Machine Guns Manned By Willing Shooters" at more of the state's coal mines.&lt;ref&gt;''Boulder Daily Camera'', November 17, 1927, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; Within days, state police and mine guards fired machine guns, rifles, and pistols against 500 unarmed miners and their wives at the Columbine mine, killing six.{{sfnp|Myers|2005a|pp=138-139}} Now faced with their own massacre, the IWW's leaders kept their focus on the immediate goal: winning the strike. After the memorial services, when some angry miners talked about getting their guns, organizers counseled them with the words of [[Joe Hill]]: "don't mourn, organize!"{{sfnp|Myers|2005a|p=142}}

The miners won a dollar a day increase from the 1927 strike.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=203}} The miners in the northern field won union recognition from the second largest coal operator in Colorado.{{sfnp|Margolis|2005|p=47}} It was not recognition of the IWW, as it turned out. The company picked a union for the miners, and it was the United Mine Workers. Nonetheless, these were the most substantial gains the miners had ever achieved from a strike in Colorado.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=203}} It was the only increase obtained by coal miners in the country during the period from 1928 to 1930.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=203}}

Although the United Mine Workers in Colorado had vocally opposed the strike, they had established an official position of neutrality. However, United Mine Workers agents conducted overt actions against the strikers, including participation in vigilante raids against IWW property.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=201}} Some UMW miners scabbed on the IWW strike,{{sfnp|Margolis|2005|p=28}} and others became informants for the state police.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=201}} One popular United Mine Workers official, a union organizer from the Ludlow era by the name of Mike Livoda, hired himself out to the governor to spy on the Wobblies.{{sfnp|Margolis|2005|p=28}}

[[Labor spies#The Colorado Coal Strike of 1927|The most pervasive spying during the 1927 strike]] was most probably conducted by [[Colorado Fuel and Iron]], the coal and steel company owned by the Rockefeller dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Rees, “X,” “XX,” and “X-3”, Spy Reports from the Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Company Archives, Colorado Heritage/Winter 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The company organized a network of spies to infiltrate, propagandize against, and disrupt the IWW. Archives currently held at the [[Bessemer Historical Society]] reveal that the company used its spies and its relationship with the authorities to compile dossiers on union activists, and to obtain photographs, IWW membership lists, private union correspondence, and other union materials related to the strike.

Summing up the Colorado coal strike, Joseph Conlin concludes that Colorado coal miners were radical, based upon their experiences, and willfully chose to have the IWW lead them. In Conlin's words, "[t]he failure of the Wobblies to establish and maintain a viable organization in Colorado resulted from the anarcho-syndicalist strategy of the IWW (i.e., no labor contracts, no union recognition), not from the absence of class consciousness and radicalism among the miners."{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=210}}

====Intermittent strikes, short strikes====
[[Vincent St. John]], theorist and leader of the Industrial Workers of the World, wrote in 1917,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A long drawn out strike implies insufficient organization or that the strike has occurred at a time when the employer can best afford a shut down—or both. Under all ordinary circumstances a strike that is not won in four to six weeks cannot be won by remaining out longer. In trustified industry the employer can better afford to fight one strike that lasts six months than he can six strikes that take place in that period.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1917"&gt;{{cite book | last = St. John | first = Vincent | year = 1917 | title = The I. W. W.—Its History, Structure and Methods | url = http://www.iww.org/en/about/official/StJohn | type = Pamphlet | publisher = I.W.W. Publishing Bureau | location = Chicago | accessdate = November 14, 2013 | at = [http://www.iww.org/about/official/StJohn/8 "I.W.W. Tactics or Methods"]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Strikes are to be called "when the employers can least afford a cessation of work—during the busy season and when there are rush orders to be filled."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1917"/&gt; If a strike does not succeed, St. John advises, then the employees go back to work and continue to conduct a job action while on the job.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1917"/&gt; (See ''[[#Strike on the job|Strike on the job]]'', below.) St. John envisioned that strike breakers could be isolated by the union. "Interference by the government is resented by open violation of the government's orders, [and] going to jail en masse..."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1917"/&gt;

====Sit-down strikes====
{{Main|sitdown strike}}

When workers conduct a sit-down strike, they take possession of the workplace by "sitting down" at their work stations, preventing the employer from replacing them with strikebreakers, or moving production to other locations.

[[File:Lucy Parsons.jpg|thumb|right|120px|alt=Portrait of a woman.|[[Lucy Parsons]]]]
[[Lucy Parsons]], whose husband was executed in the aftermath of the [[Haymarket affair]], advocated the sit-down strike in her speech at the IWW's Founding Convention. She commented, "My conception of the strike of the future is not to strike and go out and starve but to strike and remain in and take possession of the necessary property of production."&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Eldine Parsons, Freedom, equality &amp; solidarity: writings &amp; speeches, 1878-1937, Charles H. Kerr, 2004, page 83&lt;/ref&gt; Just over a year later, the IWW initiated the first sit-down strike in American history on December 10, 1906, at the General Electric Works in [[Schenectady, New York]], when 3,000 workers sat down on the job and stopped production to protest the dismissal of three union members.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=71}} The strikers were persuaded to use "syndicalistic tactics which [were] strongly advocated" in IWW literature. IWW sources reported that the AFL attacked the IWW in the local press over the strike. The AFL required its affiliates not to honor the strike, on pain of losing their charter.{{sfnp|Brissenden|1919|pp=203-204}}

The sit-down strike is similar to the [[sit-in]] protest, which was used in [[India]] during the struggle against British rule, following the experiences of [[Mohandas Gandhi]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Educational Britannica Educational, The Black Experience in America: From Civil Rights to the Present, The Rosen Publishing Group, 2010, page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Philip Taft]] and Philip Ross, U.S. workers who participate in a sit-down strike lose their legal right to recall, based upon a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="Philip Ross 1969"/&gt;

====Boycotts====
Although the IWW pioneered the economic boycott, The New York ''Tribune'' suggested that the IWW was a German front, responsible for acts of sabotage throughout the nation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated51"&gt;{{cite book | last = Starr | first = Kevin | year = 1997 | title = Endangered Dreams: The Great Depression in California | publisher = Oxford University Press US | page = 51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IWW did not use the boycott frequently in its early days, primarily because IWW members were frequently not consumers of the products which might be boycotted. However, the organization did believe that the boycott could be an effective weapon in some situations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated129"&gt;{{cite book | last = Laidler | first = Harry Wellington | year = 1914 | title = Boycotts and the labor struggle: legal and economic aspects | publisher = Columbia University | pages = 129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike|1912 textile strike]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], the IWW boycotted merchants on Essex Street who were opposed to the strikers. The boycott was successful.&lt;ref name="autogenerated129"/&gt;

In 1923, a boycott "of all California products in ship's stores" was threatened in an effort to have the Criminal Syndicalist Law repealed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated51"/&gt; The threat, carried out in conjunction with a general strike on the [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]] waterfronts, was successful in shutting down the harbors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated51"/&gt;

====General strike====
{{Main|general strike}}

According to a pamphlet produced by the Industrial Workers of the World,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A general strike is a strike involving workers across multiple trades or industries that involves enough workers to cause serious economic disruption.

In essence, a general strike is the complete and total shutdown of the economy. A general strike can last for a day, a week, or longer depending on the severity of the crisis, the resolve of the strikers, and the extent of public solidarity. During the strike, large numbers of workers in many industries (excluding employees of crucial services, such as emergency/medical) will stop working and no money or labor is exchanged. All decisions regarding the length of the strike, the groups of workers who continue working, and demands of the strikers are decided by a strike committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iww.org/en/content/general-strike-pamphlet "General Strike Pamphlet"] retrieved March 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Bill Haywood]] believed that [[industrial unionism]] made possible the general strike, and the general strike made possible industrial democracy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1911"/&gt; In a 1911 speech in New York City, Haywood explained his view of the economic situation, and why he believed a general strike was justified,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The capitalists have wealth; they have money. They invest the money in machinery, in the resources of the earth. They operate a factory, a mine, a railroad, a mill. They will keep that factory running just as long as there are profits coming in. When anything happens to disturb the profits, what do the capitalists do? They go on strike, don't they? They withdraw their finances from that particular mill. They close it down because there are no profits to be made there. They don't care what becomes of the working class. But the working class, on the other hand, has always been taught to take care of the capitalist's interest in the property.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1911"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Haywood acknowledged three different levels of general strike:

* general strike in an industry;
* general strike in a community;
* general national strike.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1911"/&gt;

The ultimate goal of the general strike, according to the Industrial Workers of the World, is to displace capitalists and give control over the means of production to workers.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=90}} Foner notes that the first person recorded mentioning the general strike as a weapon for the IWW was [[Lucy Parsons]].{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=140}} The concept didn't receive much attention from the Wobbly press until 1910, and especially 1911.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=140}}

=====Industrial democracy=====
{{Main|Industrial democracy}}

According to Wobbly theory, the conventional strike is an important (but not the only) weapon for improving wages, hours, and working conditions for working people. These strikes are also good training to help workers educate themselves about the class struggle, and about what it will take to execute an eventual general strike for the purpose of achieving industrial democracy.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=141}} During the final general strike, workers would not walk out of their shops, factories, mines, and mills, but would rather occupy their workplaces and take them over.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=141}} Prior to taking action to initiate industrial democracy, workers would need to educate themselves with technical and managerial knowledge in order to operate industry.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=141}}

According to Foner, the Wobbly conception of industrial democracy is intentionally not presented in detail by IWW theorists; in that sense, the details are left to the "future development of society."{{sfnp|Foner|1997|pp=141-142}} However, certain concepts are implicit. Industrial democracy will be "a [[New society within the shell of the old|new society [built] within the shell of the old]]."{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=142}} Members of the industrial union educate themselves to operate industry according to democratic principles, and without the current hierarchical ownership/management structure. Issues such as production and distribution would be managed by the workers themselves.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=142}}

====Strike on the job====
A "strike on the job" was often called when a conventional strike seemed likely to lose. When some Wobblies were fired for exercising a strike on the job, they would move to a different job, unafraid to repeat the tactic as needed.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=136}} (See ''[[#Silent strike, slowdown, exceptional obedience (work to rule)|Silent strike, slowdown, exceptional obedience (work to rule)]]'', below.)

====Silent strike, slowdown, exceptional obedience (work to rule)====
{{Main|slowdown}}

Several labor historians have used the expression "silent strike" to identify one strike tactic among many ascribed to the IWW.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{harvnb|Dubofsky|2000|p=98}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it doesn't appear that the Industrial Workers of the World often used the expression "silent strike." One exception was a 1911 report from [[Frank Little (unionist)|Frank Little]] to the ''Industrial Worker'' on his time working with California farmworkers. "We have the silent strike on... The slave drivers are wild—the slaves won't work as hard as they want them to."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Steven Street, Beasts of the field: a narrative history of California farmworkers, 1769-1913, Stanford University Press, 2004, page 605&lt;/ref&gt;

A definition of silent strike is offered in a book about the Filipino sugar strike of 1924-1925:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...employees who do not receive the wages demanded will go on a silent strike, staying on the job, but doing only enough work to earn the wages they receive.{{sfnp|Reinecke|1996|p=25}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the book, no IWW organizers were involved in a strike that erupted into a gunbattle, but the ''Honolulu Star-Bulletin'' blamed the IWW for the labor unrest anyway.{{sfnp|Reinecke|1996|pp=81-83}}

''[[The Harvard Monthly]]'' of 1913 offers a more embellished definition,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In case of failure to achieve any gains by a strike, the worker resorts to sabotage, the silent strike by which are gained all the advantages of the open strike without its dangers; i.e., the men keep their places at their machines, thus preventing and making unnecessary the employment of scabs, pretending to do the work for which they receive their pay, but actually doing only so much of it as is needed to deceive the overseers. At the same time the worker employs many methods of attacking the employer, such as breaking delicate parts of machinery, mixing wrong ingredients into compounds, telling truth or lies to customers, anything, in short, to force the employer to terms.

It is useless to assert that these methods will not appeal to AngloSaxon workers, as does one writer on the subject. Certainly sabotage is not "fair-play," but neither is in the eyes of the laborer, the condition which forces him to it.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard University, ''[[The Harvard Monthly]],'' Volume 56, Students of Harvard College, 1913, page 157&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The terms "exceptional obedience" and "[[Work-to-rule|work to rule]]" appear to be modern variations of a similar expression frequently used by the Wobblies—"striking on the job." This tactic went by other names (and descriptions) as well. In her introduction of the 1916 pamphlet "Sabotage", Elizabeth Gurley Flynn observed that "sabotage [is] an instinctive defense [that] existed long before it was ever officially recognized by any labor organization. Sabotage means primarily: the withdrawal of efficiency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource | last = Flynn | first = Elizabeth Gurley | title = Sabotage: The Conscious Withdrawal of The Workers' Industrial Efficiency | wslink = Sabotage (1917) | authorlink = Elizabeth Gurley Flynn | type = Pamphlet | year = 1917 | publisher = I.W.W. Publishing Bureau | location = Chicago | page = 5 | scan = Page:Sabotage (Flynn, Elizabeth Gurley).djvu/7 | oclc = 11022820 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See ''[[#Sabotage|Sabotage]]'' section, below.)

Because the IWW gave vocal support to ''sabotage'' during the period after 1910 (usually accompanied by an advisory against violence)—frequently explained as anything from conscious withdrawal of efficiency to more definite measures—the definitions tend to be vague.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|pp=160-167}} A common Wobbly expression such as "fix the job" might mean a slowdown, a work stoppage, or something more.

Dubofsky writes that the "on the job strike [is] essentially a form of non-violent sabotage", and that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sometimes, it was claimed, the workers could even effect sabotage through exceptional obedience: [[Ben H. Williams|Williams]] and [[Bill Haywood|Haywood]] were fond of noting that Italian and French workers had on occasion tied up the national railroads simply by observing every operating rule in their work regulations.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=93}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The IWW withdrew the "official" status of Flynn's sabotage pamphlet, but it is still in circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Troublemaker's Handbook 2 | publisher = Labor Notes | year = 2005 | page = 131}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 the IWW likewise advised its membership that the broad IWW definition of sabotage, essentially covering a range of activities from slacking on the job to disabling equipment, had become so distorted toward the latter (in the IWW's view) that the use of the word had become more trouble than it was worth (See ''[[#Sabotage|Sabotage]]'' section, below).&lt;ref name="autogenerated304"/&gt;

While the IWW pioneered many of these concepts, they have since been adopted and advocated by others. For example, in ''A Troublemaker's Handbook 2'', Aaron Brenner has written,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Workers have the power to inflict economic damage on a company without going on strike. They can use this power to extract concessions at the bargaining table by disrupting production, undermining management control on the shop floor, and hurting the company’s profits—while still on the job. Such “inside strategies” are not easy, but they can be better than walking out, especially when the company is prepared for a strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brenner | first = Aaron | year = 2005 | title = A Troublemaker's Handbook 2 | publisher = Labor Notes | page = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Troublemaker's Handbook'' discusses some legal aspects of "inside strategies", including the fact that legality may depend, in part, upon the reasons offered for a work to rule campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Boal | first = Ellis | year = 2005 | title = A Troublemaker's Handbook 2 | publisher = Labor Notes | page = 137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern IWW likewise offers disclaimers on its website when introducing historical documents related to sabotage, for example,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[excerpt] The IWW takes no official position on sabotage (i.e. the IWW neither condones nor condemns such actions). Workers who engage in some ... forms of sabotage risk legal sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iww.org/en/culture/library/sabotage "Sabotage - by Elizabeth Gurley Flynn"] retrieved March 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Sabotage====
{{Main|sabotage}}

When disgruntled workers damage or destroy equipment or interfere with the smooth running of a workplace, it is called workplace sabotage. While [[Luddites]] sought to "turn back the clock" to an era before the introduction of workplace machinery, radical [[trade unions|labor unions]] such as the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) have advocated sabotage as a tactical means of self-defense against unfair working conditions.

The first references to the terms "sabotage" and "passive resistance" in the IWW press appeared in approximately 1910. These terms were used in connection with a strike against a Chicago clothing company called Lamm &amp; Co.{{sfnp|Thompson|Murfin|1976|p=46}} and the connotation of sabotage in that job action referred to "malingering or inefficient work."{{sfnp|Thompson|Murfin|1976|p=81}}

The IWW was shaped in part by the [[industrial unionism]] philosophy of [[Bill Haywood|Big Bill Haywood]], and in 1910 Haywood was exposed to sabotage while touring Europe:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The experience that had the most lasting impact on Haywood was witnessing a general strike on the French railroads. Tired of waiting for parliament to act on their demands, railroad workers walked off their jobs all across the country. The French government responded by drafting the strikers into the army and then ordering them back to work. Undaunted, the workers carried their strike to the job. Suddenly, they could not seem to do anything right. Perishables sat for weeks, sidetracked and forgotten. Freight bound for Paris was misdirected to Lyon or Marseille instead. This tactic—the French called it "sabotage"—won the strikers their demands and impressed Bill Haywood.{{sfnp|Carlson|1983|p=152}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the IWW, sabotage came to mean any withdrawal of efficiency—including the slowdown, the strike, or creative bungling of job assignments.{{sfnp|Carlson|1983|pp=196-197}}

[[File:Anarchist black cat.svg|thumb|upright|right|150px|alt=A cartoon of a black cat in an alert, fighting stance, shown in profile and circled.|The black cat of the Industrial Workers of the World, also adopted as a symbol by anarcho-syndicalists]]
[[Ralph Chaplin]], an IWW artist and poet, drew the [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]]'s image of a [[Black cat#Anarcho-syndicalism|black cat]] with flashing teeth and bared claws as a symbol of the IWW's concept of sabotage. In testimony before the court in a 1918 trial of IWW leaders, Chaplin stated that the black cat "was commonly used by the boys as representing the idea of sabotage. The idea being to frighten the employer by the mention of the name sabotage, or by putting a black cat somewhere around. You know if you saw a black cat go across your path you would think, if you were superstitious, you are going to have a little bad luck. The idea of sabotage is to use a little black cat on the boss."&lt;ref&gt;''Red November, Black November: Culture and Community in the Industrial Workers of the World,'' Salvatore Salerno, 1989, SUNY Press, page 178, from ''U.S. v. W.D. Haywood, et al.,'' testimony of Ralph Chaplin, July 19, 1918, IWW Collection, Box 112, Folder 7, pp. 7702 &amp; 7711, Labor History Archive, Wayne State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the IWW was ''accused'' of outright damage to property—for example, getting the blame for causing wheat field fires in a book of fiction by [[Zane Grey]], published in 1919 at the height of the [[red scare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Grey | first = Zane | authorlink = Zane Grey | year = 1919 | title = The Desert of Wheat}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which the IWW actually practiced sabotage, other than through their "withdrawal of efficiency," is open to dispute.{{sfnp|Carlson|1983|p=197}} IWW organizers often counseled workers to avoid any actions that would hurt their own job prospects. Even so, when the term "sabotage" is applied to workers, it is frequently interpreted to mean actual destruction.{{sfnp|Thompson|Murfin|1976|p=82}} A study by Johns Hopkins University in 1939 determined,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although there are contradictory opinions as to whether the IWW practices sabotage or not, it is interesting to note that no case of an IWW saboteur caught practicing sabotage or convicted of its practice is available.{{sfnp|Thompson|Murfin|1976|p=81}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Melvyn Dubofsky has written, "...hard as they tried, state and federal authorities could never establish legal proof of IWW-instigated sabotage. Rudolph Katz ... was perhaps close to the truth when he informed federal investigators, 'The American Federation of Labor does not preach sabotage, but it practices sabotage; and the I.W.W. preaches sabotage, but does not practice it.'"{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=93}}

Conlin seems not to accept the implied Wobbly innocence on the charge of sabotage. Rather, he puts any possible transgressions into a different perspective, writing (in 1969) that in the aftermath of the anti-war crackdown,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The I.W.W.'s actual culpability of wheatfield fires and sawmill wreckings had become unimportant because of the government's greater offenses.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=20}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1918, sedition and anti-sabotage laws were passed in the United States. The General Executive Board of the IWW issued a statement referring to the anti-sabotage law,&lt;ref name="autogenerated304"&gt;John Castell Hopkins, ''The Canadian Annual Review of Public Affairs,'' 1919, pages 304-05.&lt;/ref&gt; which concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The membership will find it to their advantage to forget and drop the word. The word itself is not worth it. It may arise again in the future in its true light and in its true meaning. If so, the future will care for itself. We should be and are too busy building the [[One Big Union (concept)|One Big Union]] to argue with Congress or departments of justice as to the real meaning of a poor French word.&lt;ref name="autogenerated304"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robert Hoxie, whose work was collected in the 1921 publication ''Trade Unionism in the United States'', was one of the foremost experts on the trade union movement in the early twentieth century. Hoxie considered the Industrial Workers of the World the "most clear representative" of revolutionary unionism in the United States. In his discussion of the IWW, he explained the nature of sabotage in detail that is worth quoting at length:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sabotage is an elusive phenomena and is difficult of accurate definition. Briefly described it is called "striking on the job." J. A. Estey, in his "Revolutionary Unionism," does well when he says: "In Syndicalist practice it [sabotage] is a comprehensive term, covering every process by which the laborer, while remaining at work, tries to damage the interests of his employer, whether by simple malingering, or by bad quality of work, or by doing actual damage to tools and machinery" (p. 96). This definition puts admirably the essential, underlying characteristics of sabotage, but in practice it ranges even beyond such limits. There are almost an indefinite number of ways of "putting the boots to the employer" which have come to properly be included under the general designation, and some of them have been employed by conservative unionists time out of mind. [[Scientific management#Soldiering|Ca' Canny or soldiering]] is one of them, which was a practice long before revolutionary unionism was known to the mass of workers. In essence it is practiced by every union that sets a limitation on output. Living strictly up to impossible safety rules enacted by the employers for their own protection is another method. Wasting materials, turning out goods of inferior quality or damaging them in the process, misdirecting shipments, telling the truth about the quality of products, changing price cards, sanding the bearings, salting the soup and the sheets, "throwing the monkey wrench into the machinery"—all are methods of practicing sabotage that have become familiar.{{sfnp|Hoxie|Hoxie|Fine|1921|pp=162-63}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Violence====
A study in 1969 concluded that "IWW activity was virtually free of violence."&lt;ref name="Philip Ross 1969"/&gt; However, it was not uncommon for violence to be called for, and used against IWW organizers and members. In 1917, for example, popular organizer [[Frank Little (unionist)|Frank Little]], an officer of the IWW's General Executive Board, was hung from a Butte, Montana railroad trestle, a victim of vigilante justice.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=224}} And during the 1927 coal strike in Colorado, the ''Denver Morning Post'' editorialized that if the Wobblies picketed again, then it was time for the governor to stop withholding the "mailed fist", and to strike hard and strike swiftly against them.&lt;ref&gt;editorial, ''Denver Morning Post'', November 2, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, the ''Boulder Daily Camera'' editorialized that "machine guns manned by willing shooters are wanted" at Colorado coal mines.&lt;ref&gt;editorial, ''Boulder Daily Camera'', November 17, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, [[Columbine Mine massacre|striking miners were machine gunned]] by the state, and six died. Conlin has asserted that "few organizations in American history of any stripe have experienced repression so cynical as did the I.W.W."{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=18}}

In a few cases, violence was met with violence. Who was at fault, and who initiated the attack, have been historical questions debated to the present day in both the [[Everett massacre]] and the [[Centralia Massacre (Washington)|Centralia massacre]], although a study by [[Philip Taft]] and Philip Ross concludes that "the IWW in Everett and Centralia was the victim, and the violence was a response to attacks made upon its members for exercising their constitutional rights."&lt;ref name="Philip Ross 1969"/&gt;

Thus, it is no surprise that the question of violence was a perennial matter of discussion and debate within the IWW. Some, like [[Arturo Giovannitti]], [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], and [[Vincent St. John]], took the position that while the union did not favor violence, it would not shy away from its use if necessary to accomplish the social revolution.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=164}} [[Joseph James Ettor|"Smiling Joe" Ettor]], on the other hand, agreed with [[Bill Haywood]] that the only kind of force to which the organization could lend its name was the use of the [[general strike]] for the overthrow of [[capitalism]].{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=164}} Haywood, who had been secretary treasurer of the [[Western Federation of Miners]] during a violent period in its history, described the goals of the IWW in 1913:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It will be revolution, but it will be bloodless revolution. The world is turning against war. People are sickened at the thought. Even labor wars of the old type are passing. I should never think of conducting a strike in the old way. There will never be another [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho labor confrontation of 1899|Coeur d'Alene]], another [[Colorado Labor Wars|Cripple Creek]]. I, for one, have turned my back on violence. It wins nothing.

When we strike now, we strike with our hands in our pockets. We have a new kind of violence—the havoc we raise with money by laying down our tools. Our strength lies in the overwhelming power of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Arno Dosch, [http://www.workerseducation.org/crutch/others/dosch.html "WHAT THE I.W.W. IS"], The World's Work, vol. XXVI, no. 4 (August 1913), pp. 406-420, accessed March 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Conlin has also observed that "to dwell on the martyrs and the debacle that did in the I.W.W. (i.e., government repression after World War I) is to detract or at least to distract from the Wobblies' importance as a functioning and ... apparently successful union."{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=19}}

=====Violence and sabotage as tactics=====
In 1969 the ''History of Violence in America'' reported about the 1918 trial of IWW officers and members,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Unlike the other national federations such as the Knights of Labor, the American Federation of Labor, and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the IWW advocated direct action and sabotage. These doctrines were never clearly defined, but did not include violence against isolated individuals. Pamphlets on sabotage by Andre Tridon, Walker C. Smith, and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn were published, but Haywood and the lawyers for the defense at the Federal trial for espionage in Chicago in 1918 denied that sabotage meant destruction of property. Instead Haywood claimed it meant slowing down on the job when the employer refused to make concessions.&lt;ref name="Philip Ross 1969"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Foner observes that the IWW's General Executive Board issued a statement opposing violence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[The IWW] does not now and never has believed in or advocated either destruction or violence as a means of accomplishing industrial reform; first, because no principle was ever settled by such methods; second, because industrial history has taught us that when strikers resort to violence and unlawful methods, all the resources of Government are immediately arrayed against them and they lose their cause; third, because such methods destroy the constructive impulse which it is the purpose of this organization to foster and develop in order that the workers may fit themselves to assume their places in the new society.{{sfnp|Foner|1997|p=164}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Robert Hoxie]] writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the popular conception of things revolutionary unionism is generally distinguished by violence and sabotage. The tendency, however, to make violence the hall-mark of revolutionary unionists is a great mistake. The bulk of revolutionary unionists embraces the most peaceful citizens we have, and on principle. Most violence in labor troubles is committed by conservative unionists or by the unorganized.{{sfnp|Hoxie|Hoxie|Fine|1921|p=161}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hoxie continues,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In short, violence in labor troubles is a unique characteristic of no kind of unionism, but is a general and apparently inevitable incident of the rise of the working class to consciousness and power in capitalistic society.{{sfnp|Hoxie|Hoxie|Fine|1921|p=162}}

Secondly, revolutionary unionism is not to be marked off from other kinds of unionism by its employment of sabotage as an offensive and defensive weapon. It is true that sabotage is a weapon whose use is highly characteristic of revolutionary unionism, but the notion that its use is confined to revolutionary unionists fades out the moment its true character and varied forms are known. It is moreover distinctly repudiated by many revolutionary unionists, is not confined to revolutionary unions, and, it might be added, is not confined to workers alone.{{sfnp|Hoxie|Hoxie|Fine|1921|pp=162-63}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hoxie explains,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As the unionists point out, essentially the same thing is practiced by employers and dealers who adulterate goods, make shoddy, conceal defects of products, and sell goods for what they are not.{{sfnp|Hoxie|Hoxie|Fine|1921|pp=162-63}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Legislation, injunctions and the law====
In 1916, the [[Commission on Industrial Relations]], created by the [[U.S. Congress]], reported,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The greatest uncertainty exists regarding the legal status of almost every act which may be done in connection with an industrial dispute. In fact, it may be said that it depends almost entirely upon the personal opinion and social ideas of the court in whose jurisdiction the acts may occur.

The general effect of the decisions of American courts, however, has been to restrict the activities of labor organizations and deprive them of their most effective weapons, namely, the boycott and the power of picketing, while on the other hand the weapons of employers, namely, the power of arbitrary discharge, of blacklisting, and of bringing in strikebreakers, have been maintained and legislative attempts to restrict the employers' powers have generally been declared unconstitutional by the courts. Furthermore, an additional weapon has been placed in the hands of the employers by many courts in the form of sweeping injunctions, which render punishable acts which would otherwise be legal, and also result in effect in depriving the workers of the right to jury trial.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Patrick Walsh, Basil M. Manly, John Rogers Commons, Final report of the Commission on industrial relations, United States. Commission on Industrial Relations, Barnard &amp; Miller print, 1915, page 135&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report includes the testimony of Judge Walter Clark, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chairman Walsh. Have you studied the effect of the use of injunctions in labor disputes generally in the United States, as a student of economics and the law?

Judge Clark. I do not think they can be justified, sir, * * * [Their effect] has been, of course, to irritate the men, because they feel that in an anglo-Saxon community every man has a right to a trial by jury and that to take him up and compel him to be tried by a judge, is not in accordance with the principles of equality, liberty, and justice.

Chairman Walsh. Do you think that has been one of the causes of social unrest in the United States?

Judge Clark. Yes, sir, and undoubtedly will be more so, unless it is remedied.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Patrick Walsh, Basil M. Manly, John Rogers Commons, Final report of the Commission on industrial relations, United States. Commission on Industrial Relations, Barnard &amp; Miller print, 1915, pages 63-64&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The congressional report concludes from this exchange,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...opinions cited above are very impressive and are convincing that the workers have great reason for their attitude... such injunctions have in many cases inflicted grievous injury upon workmen engaged in disputes with their employers, and ... their interests have been seriously prejudiced by the denial of jury trial, which every criminal is afforded, and by trial before the judge against whom the contempt was alleged ... It is felt to be a duty, therefore, to register a solemn protest against this condition...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By most accounts, in spite of its apparent candor, the U.S. Congress failed to act upon this investigation of the reasons for industrial unrest.

One significant difference between the IWW and mainstream unions (specifically, the AFL) concerns their interpretation of, and reaction to the law. Laws are passed by the state. AFL unions concerned themselves with issues of law and order.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=90}} In the eyes of the IWW, the state was variously considered irrelevant, illegitimate, or merely an extension of capitalist power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]] referred to the state as "simply the slugging agency of the capitalists." {{harv|Dubofsky|2000|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IWW Preamble and Constitution, which encapsulate the organization's philosophy and to some extent, formulate policy, are silent on the specific question of government, yielding only a strong implication that government as constituted would cease to exist in a Wobbly world (a "new society within the shell of the old").&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.iww.org/en/culture/official/preamble.shtml IWW Preamble]'' retrieved March 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

To Wobblies beaten by cops while picketing the job, the only law that mattered was the law of the jungle.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|pp=88-90}} In the words of historian Melvyn Dubofsky, the AFL sought industrial harmony, the IWW praised perpetual industrial war.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=90}}

Dubofsky concludes that while Wobbly speechmaking often created a wrong perception of IWW intentions and practices, the IWW actually practiced passive resistance and promoted non-violence.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=91}} Yet passive resistance is distinct from pacifism. Dubofsky wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nonviolence was only a means to an end. If passive resistance resulted only in beatings and deaths, then the IWW threatened to respond in kind.{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=92}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Arturo Giovannitti]] summarized his perception of the Wobbly philosophy, "The generally accepted notion seems to be that to kill is a great crime, but to be killed is the greatest."{{sfnp|Dubofsky|2000|p=92}}

Labor legislation can have a very significant impact upon union organizing, and efforts to organize the coal industry offer a good example. Coal miners had been struggling for sixty years to organize unions in the Western United States, with little success.{{sfnp|Margolis|Romero|1987|p=116}} All of that changed in the early 1930s when the companies began to perceive a difference between the business unionism of the United Mine Workers, and their more radical competitors.

In 1933, [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] established the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA) including Section 7(a), guaranteeing the right to collective bargaining.{{sfnp|Margolis|Romero|1987|p=127}} The law originated with the coal industry, which had been beset by organizing drives by radical labor organizations such as the Industrial Workers of the World (Colorado strike in 1927), the Progressive Miners in Illinois, the West Virginia Mine Workers Union, and the National Miners Union (formed in 1928), which also was founded on the principles of class struggle.{{sfnp|Margolis|Romero|1987|pp=121, 127, 128}} Facing such stiff competition, the AFL-affiliated [[United Mine Workers]] was a "shambles" during this period, with its membership having dropped to less than a quarter of its former strength.{{sfnp|Margolis|Romero|1987|p=128}}

After decades of hostility toward unions, in 1931 the coal industry's magazine, ''Coal Age'', began editorializing in favor of the "desired stabilization of wages and working conditions [via] recognition and acceptance of an outside labor organization."{{sfnp|Margolis|Romero|1987|pp=127-128}} [[John L. Lewis]], President of the United Mine Workers, later claimed that his union had written the language that ultimately appeared in the NIRA.{{sfnp|Margolis|Romero|1987|p=128}} The NIRA favored a specific type of industrial union, and greatly increased the barriers to organizing radical unions.{{sfnp|Margolis|Romero|1987|pp=128-129}}

The United Mine Workers union was also supported by the government and by some coal companies against their more radical rivals.{{sfnp|Margolis|Romero|1987|pp=129, 136, 139-140}} In some cases, the United Mine Workers legitimized strike breaking by issuing union cards to miners who had crossed picket lines of a rival organization.{{sfnp|Margolis|Romero|1987|pp=131-135}} By 1936, the United Mine Workers had gained contracts with all the major coal operators in North America.

===Minority unionism===
In U.S. legal terminology, the concept of minority unionism refers to the situation in which workers who wish to engage in [[Protected concerted activity|concerted activity]], which means action taken by workers for mutual aid or protection. In the U.S., such activity is protected by federal labor law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Prosten | editor-first = David | title = The Union Steward's Complete Guide | edition = 2nd | publisher = Union Communication Services | page = 375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, concerted activity takes place, and is therefore protected, whenever two or more employees act together to improve their terms and conditions of employment. (The protections are fairly broad, although corporations frequently benefit from employees not knowing their rights.)

According to union activists, workers engaging in concerted activity may also be said to be engaging in minority unionism. While the status of concerted activity is well established, the precise legal status of bargaining rights for a minority union, or alternatively of bargaining rights for individual members of such a union, is not clear. In 2005, [[Charles Morris (legal educator)|Charles Morris]] published a legal treatise called [[The Blue Eagle At Work|The Blue Eagle At Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace]] which offers an as yet untested legal theory about minority unionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Morris | first = Charles | authorlink = Charles Morris (legal educator) | year = 2005 | title = The Blue Eagle At Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Industrial Workers of the World have held from the organization's founding that workers, whether in a majority or not, nonetheless have the right and the ability to join together to act in their own best interest, whether through traditional bargaining, or by other means. This is quite different from more orthodox unions, which typically rely upon union recognition by a workplace majority and a collective bargaining agreement, accompanied by dues checkoff and other conventions, before they will represent a group of employees.

===Dues collection===
{{Main|union dues}}
The IWW relies upon members to submit dues voluntarily, instead of relying on the "dues check off" system, in which dues are automatically deducted from workers' paychecks by their employer. Throughout the organization's history, a constitutional provision has prohibited IWW organizations from allowing employers to handle union dues.

IWW dues collection most typically operates according to the Job Delegate system, which was developed by the [[Agricultural Workers Organization]] (AWO) of the IWW.

===Boxcar Organizing===
Beginning around 1915 with the rise of the Agricultural Workers Organization, the field delegates for the IWW used itinerant workers' means of transportation, illegally hopping freight trains, to grow to their ranks. Delegates rode trains and demanded to see a Red Card, proof of membership in the IWW, from each hobo bound for the harvests. If a rider could not produce a card, he or she either had to purchase one from the delegate or get off the train. IWW organizer Harry Howard describes an instance of this in a 1916 letter to ''Solidarity'', the union's national newspaper, writing, "We left on the night of August 10th with twenty-five or thirty other fellow workers. We took charge of the train and ditched all unorganized men at stops north of Fargo."&lt;ref&gt; Harry Howard, “A Sample of ‘Justice’ for IWW Members,” Solidarity, January 13, 1917, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, the U.S. Marshal to the Western District of Washington collected 19 affidavits from freight train riders in that state who admit seeing this practice. One reads, "The IWW tried to make me take out a card in North Dakota but I refused. When in the State of Washington… I was forced to take out a card or be thrown off in a desolate country." This tactic lost effectiveness as the automobile supplanted the freight train as the most popular form of transportation for itinerant laborers in the mid- to late-1920s. &lt;ref&gt; Arianne Hermida. "Wobbly Wheels: The IWW's Boxcar Strategy," ''IwW History Project,'' http://depts.washington.edu/iww/wobbly_trains.shtml#_edn33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publicity and the Wobbly image==
The Industrial Workers of the World has enjoyed and occasionally suffered from a distinctive public image. The organization has been chronicled in fiction as varied as Zane Grey's anti-Wobbly book ''Desert of Wheat'', and James Jones' influential 1951 novel, ''From Here to Eternity''.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=11}} Conlin attributes some of the chronicles to "fascination with the vitality of those on the bottom.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=12}} He notes, however, that a romantic image of the Wobblies was not ever entirely inappropriate. For example, Haywood was frequently the recipient of invitations from [[Mabel Dodge Luhan]] and "other fashionable literati," and "a romanticized IWW" was the subject of books and poems throughout the 1910s.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=12}} Conlin observes that "no later than 1908, the Wobblies were vividly conscious of their romantic aspect and took easily to self-dramatization."{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=12}} This was evident in their singing, in their song parodies, in their skits, in their poetry and in their cartoons. From soap boxing to the Paterson pageant, from their colorful [[Wobbly lingo|lingo]] to [[Wobbly lingo#Battleship, building the|"building the battleship"]] in the free speech fight jails, Wobblies seemed to instinctively comprehend the benefits of publicity for their cause.

Conlin does note, however, that shortly after the 1913 Paterson Pageant at Madison Square Garden, the IWW officially disclaimed the utility of such productions, and "turned to more proper union activity" (in a period which coincided with the organization's dramatic growth) until the "apocalypse" of government intervention in 1917-18.{{sfnp|Conlin|1981|p=13}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1387">The '''Interchurch World Movement''' was an attempt to unite some of the main enterprises of the [[Protestant]] churches, so as to avoid duplication of effort and waste of funds.

The movement was started by the Board of Foreign Missions of the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States|Presbyterian Church]] in December 1918, when it invited the various Protestant denominations to send representatives to a meeting in New York to confer upon the need for co-operation among the churches. The result of the conference was the launching of the Interchurch World Movement with the object not of any organic union of the denominations but the attempt to see how much could be done effectively in common.

A general committee from all the churches was selected of which S. Earl Taylor became the general secretary. As head of the Methodist Centenary Fund he had shown great executive capacity and organizing ability. The Committee set itself to work to first make a survey of world conditions and it has not completed this phase of the work.

Friction appeared among the various denominations which resulted in a practical abandonment of the work in 1920.

[[File:John Fielden 1845.jpg|thumb|"One of the most experienced, most wealthy, most intelligent, and most humane men in the kingdom"&lt;ref name=1846reading1/&gt; or "The self-acting mule" : John Fielden MP, 1845]]

'''John Fielden'''  (17 January 1784 – 29 May 1849) was a British industrialist and [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] Member of Parliament for [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]] (1832–1847).

He entered Parliament to support [[William Cobbett]], whose election as fellow-MP for Oldham he helped to bring about. Like Cobbett, but unlike many other Radicals, he saw Radicalism as having little more in common with [[Whiggism]] than with [[Toryism]]: in the Commons he sat with the Whigs but frequently did not vote with them.  Whigs and the more orthodox Whig-Radicals, therefore, thought the name of one of the machines used in his  cotton-spinning business "the self-acting mule" a highly appropriate soubriquet.&lt;ref&gt;excerpt from ''The Monthly Magazine'' reviewed/quoted in {{cite news|title=Literature|work=Coventry Herald|date=17 February 1843}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Having started work in his father's cotton mill when little more than ten, he was a firm and generous supporter of the [[Factory Acts|factory reform movement]].  He also urged repeal of the [[New Poor Law]] and pressed for action to be taken to alleviate the ‘ distress of the country’ (in particular the plight of hand-loom weavers), but found little support in Parliament on these issues. Despairing that the concerns of the poor would never be given adequate attention by a ‘Ten-Pound Parliament’(elected on the 1832 franchise), he became a [[Chartism|’moral force’ Chartist]].  On the failure of the Chartist National Petition he argued for the movement to organise further petitions; when this advice was rejected he ceased to appear at Chartist events: whilst supporting the aims of Chartism, he concentrated on single issues, striving to attract wider support for reform (including those who would be deterred by any linkage to Chartism or its full agenda).  In 1847 he introduced and piloted through the Commons the [[Ten Hours Act]], limiting the hours of work of women and children in textile mills.  "Prompted solely by humanity and a sense of justice, he spent much valuable time, much earnest labour, and much of his pecuniary means, in procuring an act of parliament for shortening the hours of labour of women and children in factories.".&lt;ref&gt;Letter from J M Cobbett (dated ''The Temple London 22 August 1849'') quoted in {{cite news |title=Celebration of the Passing of the Ten Hours Act at Oldham |work=Manchester Courier |date=1 September 1849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family firm ==
John Fielden was the third son of Joshua Fielden (1749–1811&lt;ref&gt;England &amp; Wales, Society of Friends (Quaker) Burials 1578-1841 , LANCASHIRE: Monthly Meeting of Marsden: Todmorden RG6/1211&lt;/ref&gt;) a [[Quaker]] who about the time of John's birth set up as a cotton spinner in [[Todmorden]]. Joshua started cotton spinning in a small way, but by his exertions and those of his sons Fielden Brothers{{efn| Fieldens &amp; Co of Blackburn (in 1835 a partnership of William Fielden, William Throp, and William Townley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Partnerships dissolved |work=Aris’s Birmingham Gazette|date=25 May 1835}}&lt;/ref&gt; by 1848 a partnership of Sir William Fielden, Montagu Joseph Fielden, and John Leyland Fielden&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Partnerships dissolved - Gazette May 9, 1848|work=Perry’s Bankrupt Gazette|date=20 May 1848}}&lt;/ref&gt;) also owned and operated cotton mills, but had no connection with the Fieldens of Todmorden. As if to increase the possibility of confusion William was elected to Parliament (for Blackburn) in 1832 at the same time John Fielden was elected for Oldham - Parliamentary reporters seem to have taken some time to realise there were ''two'' Lancastrian millowner Fielden MPs and a bit longer to reliably distinguish between them }} grew to be one of the largest cotton manufacturers in England.&lt;ref name=Alfred&gt;{{cite book|last1="Alfred"|last2=(Kidd|first2=Samuel)|title=The history of the factory movement, from the year 1802, to the enactment of the ten hours' bill in 1847|date=1857|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co|location=London|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|I:325}} According to [[William Cobbett]] in 1832 they were involved in spinning weaving and printing and employing over 2500 persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Representation of Manchester|work=Cobbett's Weekly Political Register|date=11 February 1832}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cobbett also stressed that the brothers were "famed for their goodness to every creature who is in their employ ...let others do what they may, these gentlemen have preferred a little profit, and even no profit, to great gains from half starvation of the people from whose labour they derive those gains"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Borough of Oldham, in the County of Lancaster|work=Cobbett's Weekly Political Register|date=21 July 1832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John began working in the family mill "when I was little more than ten years old"&lt;ref name=Alfred /&gt;{{rp|I:330}} and was, therefore, able in later life to speak from personal experience of the unsuitability for children of that age of even a ten-hour day. When slightly older, he assisted his father with the purchase of raw materials and sale of finished goods – attending market in Manchester involved a round trip of 40 miles on foot, and a twenty-hour day.  After the death of his father in 1811, and of his eldest brother Samuel in 1822, John was responsible for purchasing and sales, his brother Thomas looked after a permanent warehouse Fieldens set up in Manchester, James looked after production, and the eldest surviving brother (Joshua) was responsible for machinery.&lt;ref name=tFoT&gt;"The Fieldens of Todmorden" in {{cite book|title=Fortunes made in business; a series of original sketches, biographical and anecdotic, from the recent history of industry and commerce (Volume 1)|date=1884|publisher=Sampson Low, Marston, Searle &amp; Rivington|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|418}}

Whilst Todmorden was at some distance from ports and home markets, the firm's main site at [http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~todmordenandwalsden/watersidemill.htm Waterside] lay in a narrow valley used first by the [[Rochdale Canal]] and then by the [[Manchester and Leeds Railway]] (which the Fieldens helped establish, John being a member of the company's provisional committee&lt;ref&gt;advertisement{{cite news|title=Manchester and Leeds Railway|work=Manchester Courier|date=30 October 1830}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn| The Manchester and Leeds became part of the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]]; later in the century Samuel Fielden was said to have the largest single shareholding in the L&amp;YR, and the family to be getting more income from L&amp;YR dividends than from the family firm}}) as part of an indirect but relatively low-level route between Manchester and Leeds, and the firms' expansion was helped by the consequent improvement in communications. In addition to the establishments owned by Fielden Brothers in and around Todmorden, individual members of the family also owned mills in their own right; for example in 1844 [http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~todmordenandwalsden/robinwoodmill.htm Robinwood Mill] was bought (largely built, but unglazed and without motive power) by John Fielden - however he did not operate it as a separate concern, but let it to the family firm.

In 1846, the firm was said to be processing 200,000 pounds of cotton per week; thought then to be the largest weekly consumption of cotton of any firm in the world.&lt;ref name=tFoT /&gt;{{rp|422}}  A correspondent for the ''Morning Post'' reported that within 2 miles of Todmorden there were thirty-three mills, eight of them operated by Fielden Brothers: &lt;blockquote&gt;Owing to the excellent example of the Messrs. Fielden, who employ upwards of 2,000 hands, the factories heres are much better regulated, and greater regard paid to the health and morals of the workpeople than in most other places which I have visited.  This firm have always worked their mills less time than that sanctioned by the Legislature, and have done their utmost to sustain the wages and mitigate the toil of their workpeople.  Whenever a man meets with an accident they give him half wages during his illness, and pay for medical aid.  They also change to less laborious and more healthy employment those who have become incapacitated for great exertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Short Time Question: Renewed Agitation for a Ten Hours’ Bill|work=Morning Post|date=19 November 1846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Private life==
In 1811, he married Ann Grindrod of Rochdale,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Married|work=Manchester Mercury|date=17 September 1811}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bought and converted the "Coach and Horses" public house (opposite the Fieldens' Waterside Mill) as a family home named Dawson Weir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dawson Weir House, Todmorden|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-339088-dawson-weir-house-todmorden-#.VVkqzpOCmvM|website=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had 7 children: Jane (1814), Samuel (1816), Mary (1817), Ann (1819), John (1822), Joshua (1827) and Ellen (1829).&lt;ref name=JF&gt;{{cite web|url= http://reepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~todmordenandwalsden/johnfielden.htm|title= JOHN FIELDEN OF DOBROYD CASTLE (1822-1893) AND HIS TWO VERY DIFFERENT WIVES|accessdate= 11 March 2013}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ann died in 1831;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deaths|work=Manchester Times|date=16 April 1831}}&lt;/ref&gt; John remarried Elizabeth Dearden of Halifax in 1834; she survived him, dying in 1851.

Fielden was a deeply religious man but always [[nonconformist]] in his affiliations. Born into a [[Quaker]] family, by the age of seventeen he was a teacher in a [[Methodist]] Sunday School. When the Methodist Unitarians (later simply [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]]) seceded from the Methodists, John went with them. A Unitarian Chapel was built in Bank Street, Todmorden c 1823 but struggled financially. In 1828, John bought the Chapel, paid off its debts and supported its running costs throughout his life. He taught in the Sunday School for many years, eventually becoming its Superintendent. He founded several other Sunday Schools (and to allow genuine compliance with [[Factory Acts|factory legislation]] requirements on the education of mill-children there was a school in the Fielden mill in Todmorden). He is buried in the small burial ground of the chapel (which is now flats).

== Politics ==
Although their father had been a Tory, John and his brothers were Radicals, John in particular a follower of William Cobbett.&lt;ref name=tFoT /&gt;{{rp|428}}  The brothers supported in principle, and in practice (by donations from the family firm) both Parliamentary Reform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parliamentary Reform|work=Morning Chronicle|date=18 March 1831}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and factory reform  ( including [[Michael Thomas Sadler]]’s Ten-Hour Bill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr Sadler’s Factory Bill|work=Leeds Intelligencer|date=9 August 1832}}&lt;/ref&gt; )

===Parliamentary Reform===
John was involved in Reform Bill agitation in Manchester.  He was a member of the deputation which carried to London a petition calling upon the Commons to refuse to vote supply until the Reform Bill was passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Manchester Deputation|work=Manchester Times|date=19 May 1832}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{efn| "The Manchester petition was the very first which was presented praying the House of Commons to ''stop the supplies until reform and a redress of grievances were obtained''" said the Manchester Times–  which also noted that the deputation had ‘performed the journey in SEVENTEEN HOURS’ (about six hours less than the normal stagecoach time), of which one and a half hours was accounted for by changes of horses}} To resolve differences between local Radical and Whig supporters of the Bill he subsequently drafted - and at a great reform meeting moved adoption of - an address to the King declaring a preference for universal manhood suffrage but expressing willingness to settle for Lord Grey’s Reform Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Great Public Meeting in Manchester  - On the Plains of Peterloo|work=Poor Man’s Guardian|date=19 May 1832}}&lt;/ref&gt; It being intended to form a Manchester Reform Association a sub-committee was set up to draft rules and a statement of objects: Fielden was a member of the sub-committee and responsible for the draft produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manchester Reform Association|work=Cobbett’s Weekly Political Register|date=2 June 1832}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On passage of the Reform Act, Fielden Brothers gave a dinner for their entire workforce…" Two thousand pounds weight of beef of the choicest cuts… between three and four hundred puddings weighing 7 or 8 lbs each, and a proportionate quantity of other dishes, bread and vegetables. There were 24 barrels or 3456 quarts of good brown stout  Messrs. Fieldens… assisted at the tables.  After the workpeople had dined, nearly 2000 persons not connected with the works partook of the remainder of the repast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Celebration of the Passing of the Reform Bill|work=Preston Chronicle|date=4 August 1832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Election to Parliament===
[[File:William Cobbett.JPG|thumb|upright|Portrait of William Cobbett by George Cooke, c. 1831]]As early as July 1831, hoping the Reform Bill would soon be passed, the ''Manchester Times'' (a Radical organ) had turned its thoughts to who should be Radical candidates for Manchester and other nearby newly enfranchised boroughs, asking  "Can the people of [[Rochdale]] send a better representative than their neighbour Mr John Fielden?".&lt;ref name="Rep ofNB"&gt;{{cite news|title=Representation of New Boroughs|work=Manchester Times|date=9 July 1831}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Manchester itself, it thought that only a very moderate Radical would stand a chance of election As for William Cobbett he should not seek election: he would be wasted in Parliament; he was a better speaker than a debater, and a better writer than either.&lt;ref name="Rep ofNB" /&gt;  Nonetheless, an election committee for Cobbett was formed in Manchester (John’s brother Thomas was chairman &lt;ref&gt;Advertisement (denying slurs by the ''Manchester Guardian'') {{cite news|title=At a Meeting of the General Committee, appointed for the purpose of securing the election of Mr. Cobbett…|work=Manchester Courier|date=28 January 1832}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) and invited Cobbett to a fund-raising dinner in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dinner to Mr Cobbett|work=Manchester Courier|date=4 February 1832}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|There were about 180 attendees; admission was by ticket only, price 5 shillings (excluding wine)}} Fielden was persuaded (against his objection that there were others better suited for the task) to take the chair for the meeting.  His speech of welcome and introduction for Cobbett showed him to be a close adherent to Cobbett’s views. Cobbett thought it an able speech, said as much in his own speech, and printed it two weeks running in his ''[[Political Register|Weekly Political Register]]''.  (The ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]'' criticised his views on banking and paper money; he responded in a series of three letters, promptly published (together with his speech) as ''The Mischiefs and Iniquities of Paper Money''.)

Whilst preparations for Cobbett to stand for Manchester went ahead, Fielden decided to stand, not for [[Rochdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Rochdale]] (which would elect only one MP), but for [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]] (which would elect two). He declared he would not wish to be an MP unless Cobbett had also been elected for Oldham or for some other place.&lt;ref name=BofOiCofL&gt;{{cite news|title=Borough of Oldham in the County of Lancaster|work=Cobbett’s Weekly Political Register|date=21 July 1832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cobbett had high hopes of being elected for [[Manchester (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester]] (failing that [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]]) but allowed  his name to go forward as the other Radical candidate for Oldham. "And is not the honour of being chosen by such a man as Mr John Fielden as his colleague… more than a reward for all that the hellish borough-mongers and their base and bloody press have been able to inflict upon me and upon my family?"&lt;ref name=BofOiCofL /&gt;

Although in ill-health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=My Works in Lancashire|work=Cobbett’s Weekly Political Register|date=29 September 1832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fielden then devoted his energy, influence, and resources to securing the election of both himself and Cobbett for Oldham.{{efn| The total cost was about £200, of which £80 went on election expenses (cost of the hustings, polling clerks etc) so the campaign cost was about £120 (considered remarkably low).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Oldham Election|work=Poor Man's Guardian|date=20 April 1833}}&lt;/ref&gt; A policy of 'exclusive dealing' was adopted by the Radicals; ie letting local shopkeepers etc know that they would be boycotted should they fail to vote for the Radical candidates&lt;ref name= Foster&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foster|first1=John|title=Class Struggle and the Industrial Revolution : Early industrial capitalism in three English towns|date=1974|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=0297766813|url= http://libcom.org/files/0416841007.pdf}} - title is potentially misleading- the core of the book is an account and analysis (from a Marxist viewpoint) of Oldham politics 1801-1871&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52–56}}}} Fielden and Cobbett were duly elected for Oldham, Fielden heading the poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oldham Election|work=Manchester Times|date=15 December 1832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cobbett came bottom of the poll in Manchester, with half the votes of the successful (Whig) candidates: he blamed this on the result of the Oldham election being known at an early stage of the Manchester poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=To the Cobbettites: On the Elections, and more particularly those of Oldham and of Manchester|work=Cobbett’s Weekly Political Register|date=22 December 1832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Mr Cobbett’s ... political shadow"===
Fielden did not have a powerful voice,{{efn|"John Fielden, Cobbett's colleague, was eloquent and inaudible, as usual.  What can possess such a man to come forward as a public speaker? He reminds one of a bag-piper without a bellows" said the ''Morning Post'' in an unfavourable account of proceedings at a Reform dinner at which Fielden spoke in 1836  Whig-Radicals at Halifax Disgraceful proceedings

nor were his views congenial to more than a few MPs. Consequently, he found it difficult to command the House’s attention. : "it is not in my power to convey to you the difficulties which an unobtrusive member experiences in the discharge of his parliamentary duties - it must be seen to be believed - groaning, stamping, coughing, shuffling, in fact, a perfect cock-pit; and all this is experienced whilst statements are making as to the deprivations and sufferings of the poor, that would, or ought, to melt a heart of iron."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Representation of Oldham|work=Leeds Times|date=6 December 1834}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, he acted as a reliable{{efn| ''Generally'' reliable: when, also in 1833, Cobbett moved for a list of recipients of the money voted for the [[British Museum]] (money raised from the industrious poor to pay for the amusement of the idle, in his opinion) the preceding business was got through quicker than anticipated and "Mr Fielden had stepped out of the House to write some letters, so that there was nobody to second the motion" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=To the People of Oldham|work=Cobbett's Weekly Political Register|date=30 March 1833}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} second to Cobbett (who unfortunately largely bore out the ''Manchester Times''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s prognosis). In 1833 Cobbett sought to provoke debate on currency policy by moving a resolution to remove [[Sir Robert Peel]] from the Privy Council.  "A motion more frivolous, more absurd, and ...more disreputable to its author, was never made within the walls of either house of parliament."&lt;ref name=TLoWC2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anon|title=The Life of William Cobbett|date=1835|publisher=F J Mason|location=London|edition=2|url=https://archive.org/details/lifewilliamcobb01cobbgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|287}}  Fielden loyally seconded the motion (in a long speech, quite inaudible in the reporters’ gallery because of the low tone in which he spoke and constant interruption&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Imperial Parliament|work=Morning Post|date=17 May 1833}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Cobbett and Fielden were tellers for the motion: only four other MPs voted for it: nearly 300 MPs voted against, then further voted to expunge it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=MR.

Fielden's support of Cobbett went beyond the purely Parliamentary: when Cobbett was on his deathbed in 1835, he was asked if he wished to draw up a will; he replied that he had made his arrangements, and "Mr Fielden knows all about it".&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous article in ''Penny Political Register'' 29 October 1836 quoted in {{cite book|last1=Ingrams|first1=Richard|title=The Life and Adventures of William Cobbett|date=2006|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-638825-8|page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At Cobbett’s funeral, Fielden was in the first coach of mourners (with Cobbett’s sons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Funeral of the Late Mr W Cobbett|work=Morning Post|date=29 June 1835}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fielden later paid for a [http://image1.findagrave.com/photos/2010/146/12213466_127497311138.jpg memorial tablet] for Cobbett

=== "The Curse of the Factory System" ===
In 1833 Fielden supported [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Ashley]]’s Ten-Hour Bill. Instead, Althorp’s Act (the 1833 Factory Act) was passed, Althorp commenting that if adult millworkers wanted to limit their hours of work they should do it themselves. Fielden joined with others to form a National Regeneration Society which intended to accumulate enough adherent millworkers to insist to mill-owners that adults as well as children should work no more than an eight-hour day .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr Fielden’s Letter to Mr Cobbett|work=Cobbett’s Weekly Political Register|date=14 December 1833}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This led to a split with those factory reform leaders still pinning their hopes in securing a ten-hour act by legislation.  A plan to coordinate presentation of demands to mill owners in spring 1834 came to nothing.  It amounted to formation of a national trade union; this was difficult at the best of times (which 1834, the year of the conviction of the [[Tolpuddle Martyrs]], was not) and the union was broken up by pre-emptive action by employers &lt;ref name = Driver&gt;{{cite book |last=Driver |first=Cecil Herbert |title=Tory Radical: The Life of Richard Oastler |url=https://archive.org/details/toryradicaltheli009087mbp |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=25–35 |year=1946 |oclc=183797 |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp| 262–268}}
In 1835 he suggested that the government should set minimum piece-rates for hand-loom work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minimum of Weavers’ Wages|work=Leeds Mercury|date=28 March 1835}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to hand-loom weavers doubting his sincerity and proposing instead other measures including a tax on power looms,{{efn|because he owned power looms, as well as employing hand-loom weavers: his critics held the weavers' only true friend was [[Edward Baines (1774–1848)|Edward Baines]], a serial sock-pupeteer, hence Baines was suspected to be behind the attack on Fielden}} Fielden concurred with the desirability of many of the other measures, but held that the best tax on machinery was to limit the hours it could be worked.&lt;ref&gt;Letter dated  ''Waterside 30 April 1835'' quoted in {{cite news|title=Hand-loom Weavers|work=Leeds Times|date=6 June 1835}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1836 he opposed Poulet Thomson’s Bill, speaking against it in Parliament and producing a pamphlet ''The Curse of the Factory System'' ("A Short Account of the Origin of Factory Cruelties; of the Attempts to Protect the Children by Law; of Their Present Sufferings; Our Duty Towards Them; Injustice of Mr Thomson's Bill; the Folly of the Political Economists; a Warning Against Sending the Children of the South into the Factories of the North"){{efn| published by Anne Cobbett&lt;ref&gt;Advetisement {{cite news|title=Mr Fielden's Pamphlet|work=The Champion|date=18 September 1836}}&lt;/ref&gt; (daughter of William)}} whose object he summarised as "to show that the workpeople have been and are cruelly treated; that they have not idly asked for protection, but that humanity and justice require it; that we shall do ourselves no harm by granting it to them; but always avowing, that I would cast manufactures to the winds, rather than see the workpeople enslaved, maimed, vitiated, and broken in constitution and in heart, as these pages will but too amply prove they now are."&lt;ref name=LSextracts&gt;Extract from ''The Curse of the Factory System'' quoted in {{cite news|title=The Standard Tuesday Evening May 24|work=London Standard|date=24 May 1836}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He spoke of his own experience as a factory child forty years previous, and showed why the work was as (or more) onerous for children in the 1830s as he had found it in the 1790s: &lt;blockquote&gt;As I have been personally and from an early age engaged in the operations connected with factory labour; that is to say, for about 40 years, a short account of my own experience may not be useless in this place, as it is this experience which teaches me to scoff at the representations of those who speak of the labour of factories as " very light," and "so easy, as to require no muscular exertion."  I well remember being set to work in my father's mill when I was little more than ten years old; my associates, too, in the labour and in recreation are fresh in my memory.  Only a few of them are now alive; some dying very young, others living to become men and women; but many of those who lived have died off before they had attained the age of fifty years, having the appearance of being much older, a premature appearance of age which I verily believe was caused by the nature of the employment in which they had been brought up.  For several years after I began to work in the mill, the hours of labour at our works did not exceed ten in the day, winter and summer, and even with the labour of those hours, I shall never forget the fatigue I often felt before the day ended, and the anxiety of us all to be relieved from the unvarying and irksome toil we had gone through before we could obtain relief by such play and amusements as we resorted to when liberated from our work.  I allude to this fact, because it is not uncommon for persons to infer, that, because the children who work in factories are seen to play like other children when they have time to do so, the labour is, therefore, light, and does not fatigue them.  The reverse of this conclusion I know to be the truth.  I know the effect which ten hours' labour had upon myself; I who had the attention of parents better able than those of my companions to allow me extraordinary occasional indulgence.  And he knows very little of human nature who does not know, that, to a child, diversion is so essential, that it will undergo, even exhaustion in its amusements.  I protest, therefore, against the reasoning, that, because a child is not brought so low in spirit as to be incapable of enjoying the diversions of a child, it is not worked to the utmost that its feeble frame and constitution will bear.&lt;br /&gt;
I well know, too, from my own experience, that the labour now undergone in the factories is much greater than it used to be, owing to the greater attention and activity required by the greatly-increased speed which is given to the machinery that the children have to attend to, when we compare it with what it was 30 to 40 years ago; and, therefore,  I fully concur with the government commissioners, that a restriction to ten hours per day, is not a sufficient protection to children.&lt;br /&gt;
The work at which I was employed in my boyhood, while it was limited to ten hours a day, was similar to the work that children have to do in the woollen mills of Yorkshire at the present time, with this difference, that wool is the manufacture in the Yorkshire mills to which I allude, and the manufacture that I was employed in was cotton, the mode  of manufacturing which has been altogether changed since that period by the improvements made in machinery.  These are facts which I mention, because the labour of the child in the woollen now, is what its labour in the cotton was then, the work being done on what are called "billies" and "jennies"; and I mention them, too, because the woollen  manufacturers would have it believed that the work of children in woollen mills is still lighter than that  in the cotton factories, and that children, much younger than those whose labour is now limited to eight hours a day, may without injury to their health, be worked 69 hours per week.  Indeed, it is on this, that the Yorkshire mill-owners have petitioned the House of Commons to allow them to work children of eight years of age as many as 72 hours in the week, or 12 hours in the day !&lt;ref name=LSextracts /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The 'curse of the factory system' was not that the system existed, but that it had been left unregulated.  Consequently, improvements in machinery allowed no improvement in hours and conditions for the workforce; instead there was a race to the bottom: &lt;blockquote&gt;Most of the masters are obliged to admit the excessive hours of labour imposed on children, and the ministers have done it in the most solemn manner; but they cannot interfere with the labour, the "free labour" of the adult, because that is against sound principle!  According to their own showing, it is a choice of evils; but, contrary to reason, contrary to all acknowledged principle and to universal practice, they would choose the greater: they would overwork the child, though nature forbids it, rather than shorten the labour of the adult, who is also overworked. In short, their "principle", their true and scarcely disguised "principle " is the principle of self against nature.&lt;br /&gt;

Here, then, is the "curse" of our factory system: as improvements in machinery have gone on, the "avarice of masters" has prompted many to exact more labour from their hands than they were fitted by nature to perform, and those who have wished for the hours of labour to be less for all ages than the legislature would even yet sanction, have had no alternative but to conform more or less to the prevailing practice, or abandon the trade altogether &lt;ref name=LSextracts /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fielden had voted against the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 at every stage; he then opposed its implementation in Todmorden and in Oldham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Great Public meeting at Todmorden relative to the New Poor Law|work=The Champion|date=26 February 1837}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the only MP present at the great Yorkshire Anti-Poor Law Meeting at Hartshead Moor in May 1837 (and spoke at that meeting.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poor Law Meeting|work=Carlisle Journal|date=27 May 1837}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1837-8 he was a member of a Commons committee taking evidence on the working of the New Poor Law;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dinner to John Fielden, Esq., M.P.|work=Morning Chronicle|date=8 June 1838}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the committee reported favourably Fielden complained that it had taken evidence chiefly from members of the Poor Law Commission and from Poor Law Guardians known to be supportive of the new regime and that his attempts to submit them to hostile questioning had been obstructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Imperial Parliament|work=London Standard|date=8 August 1838}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Parliament, he moved repeatedly for repeal of the 1834 Act: "so long as he had a seat in that House, he would by speech and vote resist a law which was based upon the false and wicked assertion that the labouring people of England, or any material part of them, were inclined to idleness and vice"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=POOR LAW—ADJOURNED DEBATE|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=27 June 1842|volume=64|pages=cc643-91|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1842/jun/27/poor-law-adjourned-debate#S3V0064P0_18420627_HOC_31|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was always defeated by overwhelming majorities, most MPs with misgivings about the administration of the New Poor Law thinking its complete repeal too drastic a step.&lt;ref&gt;eg {{cite journal|title=REPEAL OF THE NEW POOR-LAW|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=20 February 1838|volume=40|page=cc1362-413|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1838/feb/20/repeal-of-the-new-poor-law#S3V0040P0_18380220_HOC_19|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1842, when a Poor Law Amendment Act was required to extend the life of the Poor Law Commission, Fielden repeatedly attempted to obstruct this by procedural means: "Mr. Fielden moved that the Chairman do leave the Chair. Sir R. Peel protested against the course which the hon. Member was pursuing. He hoped that hon. Members would not thus endanger one of the most important privileges of the House. The course now adopted was calculated to obstruct the progress of legislation, to bring the House into great discredit, and to impair their authority as a deliberative assembly"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=POOR-LAW AMENDMENT.|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=12 July 1842|volume=65|pages=cc28-78|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1842/jul/12/poor-law-amendment#S3V0065P0_18420712_HOC_78|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielden attempted to prevent the New Poor Law from being implemented in his area, threatening to close the family firm down unless the Guardians of the Todmorden Poor Law Union resigned. When they didn't the Fielden mills duly closed, throwing nearly 3,000 out of work.  The Guardians stood firm, troops were moved into the area, and after a week Fieldens re-opened (paying their employees as normal for the week not worked)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Whig Poor Law in Todmorden|work=The Champion|date=22 July 1838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some townships refused to recognise the authority of the Guardians. and instructed (or intimidated) their 'overseer of the poor' to ignore the Guardians' instructions. Two constables were sent from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] to distrain the goods of an overseer fined for disobeying the Guardians. The constables were surrounded by a mob summoned from two of Fielden's mills (supplemented by navvies building the Manchester &amp; Leeds Railway), roughly treated and made to promise never to return.  The following week a mob again gathered in the belief that another attempt at [[distraint]] was to be made; when this did not happen, they attacked the houses of various guardians and supporters of the New Poor Law, causing damage put at over £1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Todmorden Riots|work=Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser|date=1 December 1838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Manchester Guardian'' thought it significant that a [[Justice of the peace|JP]] in residence (meaning Fielden) had made no effort to quell the riot, even though the rioters had marched past his front door.  Fielden was not a [[Magistrate (England and Wales)|magistrate]]; he had been nominated in 1836, but made no attempt to qualify as he would 'have to sit in judgement on men driven to crime by poverty' which the Government had refused to relieve;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Debates in Parliament|work=Leeds Intelligencer|date=8 July 1837}}&lt;/ref&gt; furthermore, he had not been in Todmorden on the day of the riot. The ''Guardian'' thought this to also be significant, but Fielden was never implicated in the riots, although he was ostentatious in his non-cooperation with attempts to identify and arrest ringleaders and in his attempts to get those arrested released on bail.

===Chartism===

Fielden concurred with the aims of Chartism, and throughout was a good friend to the movement and to its more moderate leaders.  He refused, however, to be associated with anything going beyond 'moral force' (meetings and petitions).  Consequently, he was actively associated with the Chartist movement in 1838-1839, seeing its National Petition as a more hopeful route to reform than his efforts in Parliament: "He was sick of this piecemeal labouring for the last six years to benefit the people.  In all his attempts he had failed…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Radical proceedings at Todmorden|work=Leeds Times|date=6 October 1838}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was chairman of a monster Chartist meeting at [[Kersal Moor]] (Manchester racecourse) in September, at which he warned his hearers against being bought-off by piecemeal reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The great meeting of the Radicals of Lancashire|work=London Standard|date=25 September 1838}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This culminated with his involvement in the presentation of the National Petition to Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The National Petition|work=Northern Liberator|date=22 June 1839}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the National Petition was rejected, Fielden advised that another petition should be produced, but this time with greater care to collect only valid signatures; no representative legislature could for long withstand repeated petitioning.  His advice was rejected as being a slow and uncertain route to success, and the Chartists turned towards 'physical force' methods (a general strike, or the acquisition of arms with the inherent threat of their eventual use, rather than an imminent uprising).  Fielden was opposed to such methods {{efn| on several grounds; morality of coercion, incompatibility of role as MP with support of extra-Parliamentary coercion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Northern Star|work=The Champion|date=8 September 1839}}&lt;/ref&gt; and little likelihood of success}} and severed all formal links with the movement.  Henceforth, he attended only meetings for reform on a single issue, and opposed any introduction of other Chartist demands into the meeting resolutions: any association of a specific reform with the Charter would drive away non-Chartist sympathisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-Poor Law Meeting|work=The Charter|date=30 June 1839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ten Hour Act ===
{{details|Factories Act 1847}}
Fielden was critical of many aspects of the operation of the 1833 Act.  Amongst its inherent problems was that it defined "children" and "young people" by age, but did so before there was any state system for registration of births; consequently age had to be certified by examination and a subjective judgement by surgeons.  To assist this, a factory inspector promulgated a regulation using height as an objective test.  Fielden objected,; the height criterion – unreviewed by Parliament - undermined Parliament’s intentions – Fielden’s nine-year-old son Joshua was tall enough to be certified as thirteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr Fielden MP and the Factory Inspector|work=The Champion|date=16 October 1836}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, Fielden publicised cases in which magistrates were reluctant to convict millowners of breaches of the Act, and keen to award costs against those bringing unsuccessful prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lord Althorp’s Factory Act|work=The Champion|date=1 January 1837}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He opposed attempts to weaken the Act and continued to press for further restriction of working hours.  In Parliament, Lord Ashley was the principal advocate of a Ten-Hour Act; his vulnerability (and that of other benevolent Conservatives) to the accusation of muddle-headed interference in matters he did not understand was greatly reduced by the support given him by Fielden: " They might accuse... (Lord John Manners or Lord Ashley) ...  with wild enthusiasm or measureless philanthropy, and with a want of that interest which a stable Government must feel for every class of the community. But they could not accuse the late [[Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet|Sir Robert Peel]], or the present hon. Member for Oldham, with visionary views. Both in the one case and the other, the parties must have been deeply interested in the prosperity of the manufacturing body." argued a supporter of Ashley's Bill of 1846.&lt;ref name=1846read2day2&gt;{{cite journal|title=THE TEN HOURS' FACTORY BILL|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=13 May 1846|volume=86|pages=cc466-536|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1846/may/13/the-ten-hours-factory-bill|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|c503}}

In 1846, Lord Ashley introduced a Ten-Hour Bill

He, therefore, resigned from Parliament rather than vote against his personal views or the wishes of his constituents;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Resignation of Lord Ashley MP|work=London Standard|date=2 February 1846}}&lt;/ref&gt; later further clarifying the situation by saying that he would not contest the by-election brought about by his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Representation of Dorsetshire|work=London Standard|date=13 February 1846}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fielden then took charge of Ashley's Factory Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Factories Bill|work=Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser|date=4 February 1846}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  Bill proposed a one-year experiment with an eleven-hour day before moving to a ten-hour day:&lt;ref&gt;Text is given in {{cite news|title=The Factories Bill|work=Dundee, Perth, and Cupar Advertiser|date=6 February 1846}}&lt;/ref&gt; however some of the Bill's supporters appeared to envisage settling for an eleven-hour limit: when an opponent contrasted this with Fielden's position of 'Ten Hours and no compromise' Fielden denied that he had said anything about a compromise.{{efn| Out of Parliament, however, Fielden had said (in passing) that the movement should not settle for a minute short of ten hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE TEN HOURS’ BILL—LORD ASHLEY IN MANCHESTER|work=Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser|date=4 March 1846}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} There was considerable agitation in the country for a Ten-Hour Bill and more petitions were presented to Parliament supporting the 1846 Bill than for repeal of the Corn Laws; however the Bill was defeated at Second Reading 193-203.&lt;ref name=1846secondreadingvote&gt;{{cite journal|title=FACTORIES BILL|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=22 May 1846|volume=86|issue=cc997-1080|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1846/may/22/factories-bill#S3V0086P0_18460522_HOC_27|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fielden's advice to the Short Time Committees was that they should continue to press for ten hours, submit a Ten-Hour Bill again in the next session, and reject any eleven-hour compromise; other MPs associated with the movement (such as [[Charles Hindley (politician)|Charles Hindley]]) were more prepared to consider an eleven-hour compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Ten Hours' Bill - Important Meeting of Delegates|work=Morning Post|date=29 December 1846}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To answer two arguments which opponents of the 1846 Bill had made much of, meetings (twenty-one in all)  were held in most of the major textile towns of Northern England (generally addressed by one or more of Lord Ashley, Fielden or Oastler): all were well attended, and at each motions were passed to declare that 
* what was sought was a ten-hour day (not an eleven-hour one)

In January 1847, Fielden introduced much the same bill as Ashley's Bill of the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FACTORIES|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=26 January 1846|volume=89|pages=cc487-98|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1846/jan/26/factories|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1847 Bill passed its Second Reading by 195 votes to 87&lt;ref name=1847secondr2 &gt;{{cite journal|title=FACTORIES BILL—ADJOURNED DEBATE|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=17 February 1847|volume=90|issue=cc127-75|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1847/feb/17/factories-bill-adjourned-debate#S3V0090P0_18470217_HOC_4|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its Third Reading by 151 to 88.&lt;ref name=1847c3r&gt;{{cite journal|title=Factories Bill|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=3 May 1847|volume=92|issue=cc306-12|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1847/may/03/factories-bill#S3V0092P0_18470503_HOC_12|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Representation of Oldham after Cobbett===
At the by-election at Oldham consequent upon Cobbett’s death, Fielden supported the candidature of John Morgan Cobbett (one of Cobbett’s sons). J.M. Cobbett (like his father) favoured reform of the [[Church of England]], but not its [[disestablishment]], and thus was not entirely satisfactory to [[Dissenter|Dissenting]] electors. [[Feargus O'Connor]] presented himself at the hustings as a more genuinely Radical candidate: he withdrew but not before alleging that Fielden had not been straightforward with O’Connor and had been determined to impose the younger Cobbett on the constituency. Cobbett lost narrowly to a local ‘Liberal Conservative’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oldham Election|work=Morning Chronicle|date=16 July 1835}}&lt;/ref&gt; for whom Hansard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/people/mr-john-lees}}&lt;/ref&gt; does not record any speeches in the two years he sat for Oldham. In the 1837 General Election a fellow-Radical ([[William Augustus Johnson|General Johnson]]) was elected alongside Fielden. When Johnson announced he would not stand in the 1847 general election [[William Johnson Fox]], a noted anti-Corn Law orator came forward as a Radical replacement for Gen Johnson; Fielden said he would only stand again if J.M. Cobbett was the other Radical candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Fielden dated "''London June 29, 1847''", quoted in{{cite news|title=Representation of Oldham|work=Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser|date=3 July 1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four candidates stood at the election; three Radicals (Fox, Fielden, Cobbett), and a Tory (Duncuft). Many electors cast their two votes for Duncuft and Fox (not natural political allies); neither Fielden nor Cobbett were elected.&lt;ref name=OldEl1847&gt;{{cite news|title=Oldham Election|work=Manchester Times|date=3 August 1847}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fielden thought his defeat to have been engineered by [[Manchester Liberalism|Manchester School]] ''laissez-faire'' liberals in revenge for his success in obtaining a Ten-Hour Act, others thought that he had brought it upon himself by his 'dictation' of the choice of candidate:&lt;ref name=OldEl1847 /&gt; other local Ten-Hour advocates, such as [[Joseph Brotherton]] at [[Salford (UK Parliament constituency)|Salford]] had had no similar problem. {{efn| Brotherton, however, could be more confident of the support of Dissenters, having voted on religious issues as they would have wished: against the creation of a new Anglican diocese of Manchester, and against the Education Grant (money to be disbursed via the Privy Council on support of schools giving education, including religious education, in most cases by the Church of England).  Fielden had not: he had not voted in any division on the Bishop of Manchester; he had voted for the Education Grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=SUPPLY—GOVERNMENT PLAN OF EDUCATION—ADJOURNED DEBATE (FOURTH NIGHT).|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=23 April 1847|volume=91|page=cc1273-313|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1847/apr/23/supply-government-plan-of-education}}&lt;/ref&gt; A public meeting of Oldham dissenters in June 1847 passed a resolution not to vote for anyone who had voted for the Education Grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Election News|work=Leeds Mercury|date=19 June 1847}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was more blue water between Fox and Fielden on the education issue than on factory reform.

== Last Years ==
By 1847, Fielden was in poor health.  Soon after his defeat at Oldham, he retired from business and (officially) from politics, moving from Todmorden to [http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-357207-skeynes-park-edenbridge-kent#.VZhbAEaCn08 Skeynes Park ] near [[Edenbridge, Kent]] .{{efn| Bought whilst still an MP, but no earlier than 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Births|work=Morning Post|date=23 July 1844}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The estate passed to his daughter Mary, who subsequently married J M Cobbett, whom she outlived.  When the estate was sold on her death, it was said to be of 411 acres (including a farm with sitting tenant)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='On the borders of Kent and Surrey' (advertisement)|work=London Standard|date=2 May 1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Skeynes was convenient for London, and when problems emerged with implementation of the Ten-Hour Act and its potential circumvention by adoption of a relay system Fielden became involved in repeated lobbying of the Prime Minister and Home Secretary.  These continued exertions on behalf of the millworkers were said to have hastened his death in May 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Late Mr John Fielden|work=Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser|date=9 June 1849}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fielden's children consequently took a poor view of the Compromise Act of 1850 (which retroceded some of the gains of their father's Ten Hours Act in order to end the relay system), and of Lord Shaftesbury who had forced the Compromise Act upon the Ten-Hour movement, thus (in the Fieldens' eyes) betraying the cause for which their father had given everything for two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Joshua Fielden 21 May 1869 printed as {{cite news|title=The Oastler Monument|work=London Standard|date=24 May 1869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Mary: Married (1851) John Morgan Cobbett who had twice stood unsuccessfully for Oldham.  Cobbett was a barrister, a Sussex JP and in his later years chairman of Quarter Sessions for West Sussex.  He served as  MP for Oldham 1852-1865: outside Oldham he was generally taken to be sitting as a Liberal, despite having been elected in 1852 as the Radical half of a Radical-Tory alliance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Elections|work=Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser|date=10 July 1852}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  in 1857 whilst admitting to supporting Lord Palmerston being careful to note that the Liberal Chief Whip had no confidence in him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The General Election|work=Morning Post|date=30 March 1857}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865 he stood unsuccessfully in conjunction with a Conservative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oldham Election|work=Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser|date=24 June 1865}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was opposed by two avowed Liberals.  He was again elected as one of the MPs for Oldham in 1872, and served until his death in 1877 as an acknowledged  Conservative (but one calling for annual Parliaments and manhood suffrage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Death of Mr Cobbett MP|work=Pall Mall Gazette|date=14 February 1877}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Death of Mr J M Cobbett MP for Oldham r|work=Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertise|date=15 February 1877}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ann: Married Henry Brocklehurst, son of  [[John Brocklehurst (politician)|John Brocklehurst]], MP for Macclesfield.  Both Ann and Henry died 1870; their two youngest children being effectively adopted by their uncle John Fielden of Grimston Park. One of the other children of the marriage( [[John Brocklehurst, 1st Baron Ranksborough|John Fielden Brocklehurst]]) was raised to the peerage as Lord Ranksborough in 1914.
*John: Chairman of the Todmorden Local Board, and a JP. Married twice; firstly a Unitarian Power Loom Weaver, secondly the daughter of an Anglican clergyman.  An accident at a meeting of the Bedale Hunt in 1873 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Accident in the Hunting Field|work=Leeds Mercury|date=21 April 1873}}&lt;/ref&gt; confined him to a wheelchair thereafter. Not a public man, but having bought [[Grimston Park]] an estate near Tadcaster served for a year as High Sheriff of Yorkshire and launched an orphaned Brocklehurst niece in Yorkshire county society. A Conservative and an Anglican in his later years. 
*Joshua: Married Ellen Brocklehurst, a niece of John Brocklehurst. From 1868 to 1880 Conservative MP for Eastern Division of West Riding, arguing Conservatism was a better home than Gladstonian Liberalism for a Cobbettite Radical such as himself.  Bought and moved to Nutfield Priory, near Reigate in the early 1870s.  Briefly a director of the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]], resigning after objecting to [[Edward Watkin|the chairman's]] autocratic regime. Retired from Parliament because of ill health which caused a prolonged absence from Parliament in 1876-1877 and dogged him to his death in 1887, leading to him wintering in Cannes and cruising in his steam yacht ''Zingara'' for his health.  As a result of this extravagant lifestyle his estate when he died was valued at only slightly over half a million pounds. {{Main article|Joshua Fielden (politician)}}
*Ellen: Married William Charge Booth of Oran Hall Catterick,; two daughters (1862, 1864); died 1864.

'''Kenja Communication''',&lt;ref name=kenja&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kenja.com.au| title = Kenja Communication| publisher = Kenja Trust }}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply '''Kenja''', is an Australian company co-founded in 1982 by [[Ken Dyers|Kenneth Dyers]] and his partner, Jan Hamilton. The word 'Kenja' is derived from the first letters of their names. There are four Kenja centres in Sydney, Greater Western Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. Kenja Communication runs classes, workshops and one-to-one sessions, as well as events and activities at different venues around Australia. It has gained public attention through court trials involving various members of the group, leader Ken Dyers's suicide, and the group's alleged involvement in the [[Cornelia Rau]] case.

==About Kenja==
Kenja describes its purpose on its website: &lt;blockquote&gt;To increase understanding of the spiritual nature of man and our relation to the human spirit, coupled with practical training in the basics of effective communication – time, space and energy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The training is based on the research done by Ken Dyers over 60 years, into an understanding of the spirit, the human spirit, and how a better understanding of energy can assist the individual to be more effective in the different areas of their life.

The site also states that Kenja Communication is "neither political nor religious". Kenja describes itself as being an advocate for the empowerment of the individual, ready to assist them be in charge of their own destiny.

A former [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] parliamentarian [[Stephen Mutch]], with detailed knowledge of high-ranking members described Kenja as "a sinister organisation designed to fill the pockets and stroke the egos"&lt;ref name="the monthly"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2005/september/1315447714/robert-manne/unknown-story-cornelia-rau | title = The Unknown Story of Cornelia Rau | author = Robert Manne |work=[[The Monthly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="lcouncil"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legislative Council Hansard |publisher=[[Parliament of New South Wales]] |date=22 April 1993 |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hanstrans.nsf/v3ByKey/LC19930422 |accessdate=22 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926001912/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hanstrans.nsf/V3ByKey/LC19930422 |archivedate=26 September 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; under [[Parliamentary Privilege]] in the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] in 1993.

===Energy conversion===
Kenja training focuses on a form of meditation it calls Energy Conversion, which it describes as a way to "permanently eliminate the suppressed emotion, thought or energy that can divert us from what we want to achieve".&lt;ref name=kenjaenergy&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kenja.com.au/Home/BasisofTraining/EnergyConversionMeditation/tabid/227/Default.aspx| title = Energy Conversion| publisher = Kenja Communication }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre Documentary: ''Guilty Until Proven Innocent''===
For 10 years, the Kenja has produced, in Sydney, Melbourne, and Canberra, a theatre documentary called ''Guilty Until Proven Innocent''.&lt;ref name=guiltyuntilproveninnocent&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.guilty-until-proven-innocent.com| title = 'Guilty Until Proven Innocent' Theatre Documentary| publisher = Kenja Trust }}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary purported to expose "a 15-year-long attack on Kenja and the reputation of Ken Dyers",&lt;ref name=kenjaattacked&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kenja-attacked.com| title = Kenja Attacked: The attack on spiritual freedom| publisher = Kenja Trust }}&lt;/ref&gt; and concludes the perceived attack on Dyers is part of a much wider attack on the "spiritual liberty" of the general public.&lt;ref name="smh-clear-leader"/&gt;

The ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reviewed the theatre documentary in the following articles: "Abuse Case: Staff asked to Lie",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/abuse-case-staff-asked-to-lie/2008/07/25/1216492732911.html?page=fullpage|title=Abuse case: 'staff asked to lie'|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=26 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Campaign to Clear Cult Leader".&lt;ref name="smh-clear-leader"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2007/08/11/1186530630814.html?page=fullpage|title=Campaign to clear cult leader|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=11 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Downing Centre]] Local Court, on 26 August 2008, Magistrate R. Clisdell made the following observation about the documentary in his summary: "I find the lecture series to be a continuation of that harassment, in that a reasonable person in the position of (victim's name) could be harassed and intimidated by that performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s2658609.htm|title=Media Watch: Paying to Clear A Name – Again (17/08/2009) |work=[[Media Watch (TV program)]] |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The City of Melbourne cancelled the venue booking of the 2009 Kenja Eisteddfod. It created some controversy as Kenja claimed it was probably connected with the theatre documentary, scheduled to be shown after the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://melbourne-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/dances-with-spirits/ |title=Controversial group ousted from town hall |date=13 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121212073641/http://melbourne-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/dances-with-spirits/ |archivedate=12 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre documentary continues to be shown in Melbourne, Canberra, and Sydney.

===Classification as a cult or sect===
Kenja Communications has been reported as a cult/sect in the [[High Court of Australia]], the [[Parliament of New South Wales|NSW Parliament]],&lt;ref name="lcouncil"/&gt; ''The Fairfax and News Limited Media'' by [[Robert Manne]] (an eminent professor of politics at [[La Trobe University]]),&lt;ref name="the monthly"/&gt; and by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/allinthemind/the-psychology-of-cults/4392444 | title= The Psychology of Cults | publisher=ABC Radio National | date=2 December 2012 | accessdate=5 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Ken Dyers and Jan Hamilton have claimed that the word ''cult'' is pejorative, and allege they are targeted in a "witch hunt" over allegations of sexual misconduct and in relation to the Cornelia Rau incident.&lt;ref name="smh-clear-leader"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/cult-leader-says-sex-charges-part-of-witchhunt/2005/10/28/1130400339271.html|title=Cult leader says sex charges part of witch-hunt|date=28 October 2005|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Dance-photos-reminder-of-a-troubled-trainee/2005/02/11/1108061872287.html|title=Reminder of a troubled trainee|date=12 February 2005 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kenja and mental illness==
===Cornelia Rau===
In 2005, a mentally ill former Kenja member, [[Cornelia Rau]], gained widespread media attention in Australia due to being unlawfully detained for a period of 10 months by the [[Australian government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2005/cornelia-chronology.htm|title=Cornelia Rau Chronology|work=Four Corners}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, she had disappeared and later turned up in North Queensland, where Aboriginal people alerted the police after being concerned about her behaviour. She told them she was Anna Brotmeyer (and later Anna Schmidt) from Germany. Immigration officials assumed she was an illegal immigrant and failed to diagnose her [[schizophrenia]], leading to her detention.

Her family accused Kenja of contributing to her declining mental health.&lt;ref name="face"&gt;{{cite web | title = This is the face behind a cult | work = [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]] | date = 10 February 2005 | first = Lisa | last = Davies }}&lt;/ref&gt; A claim has been made that she developed [[schizophrenia]] during her time as a member of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Davies | first = Lisa | title = Cult linked to Cornelia | work = [[Herald Sun]] | date = 8 February 2005 | page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rau_angry"&gt;{{cite web | last = Naughton | first = Kevin | title = Rau angry at sister's visit – but family sees hopeful signs | work = [[The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)|The Sunday Mail]] | date = 13 February 2005 | page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to her small involvement with Kenja between May and October 1998 during her 4-month off from working with [[Qantas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.themonthly.com.au/monthly-essays-robert-manne-unknown-story-cornelia-rau-often-she-cried-sometimes-she-screamed-she-be|title=THE UNKNOWN STORY OF CORNELIA RAU | author = ROBERT MANNE | date = September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was discovered that she already had this condition in 1996 (8 years prior to being picked up at Coen, North Queensland in March 2004) with her family enduring her troubled journey with many psychotic episodes&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/media_releases/media05/palmer-report.pdf|title=Palmer Report - 2.3.1 - A Private Citizen|last=|first=|date=2005-07-17|website=Palmer Report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050717070306/http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/media_releases/media05/palmer-report.pdf|archive-date=17 July 2005|dead-url=bot: unknown|access-date=2017-07-21|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also great at masking her symptoms when she wanted to .&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hamilton denied any wrongdoing, saying: "We are not responsible for Cornelia's condition...we are not a cult. It's a witch-hunt." Rau's sister, other family members, and several members of Kenja present at the time formed a different opinion while observing Rau's involvement in the group.&lt;ref name="face"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/immigration/raus-sister-blames-cult/2005/02/08/1107625185186.html | title = Rau's sister blames cult |series = Immigration features | work = [[The Age]] | author = Daniel Ziffer | date = 8 February 2005 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton also claimed, retrospectively, Rau was "scattered, disassociated" as a member of the group, and that she was asked to leave because she needed help and the group "couldn't help her".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wainwright | first = Robert | title = Dance photos reminder of a troubled trainee | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = 12 February 2005 | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, witnesses quoted in the media say she was humiliated and expelled.&lt;ref name="rau_angry"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Davies | first = Lisa | title = The humiliation of Cornelia Rau | work = [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 11 February 2005 | page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim has been made that Rau was driven to the airport on the night of the Melbourne Eisteddfod, put on an aeroplane to Sydney, and told never to return to the group. Three days later she was picked up by New South Wales police driving on the wrong side of the road.

Rau was incarcerated in the German psychiatric system following a trip while on [[Drug holiday|medication vacation]] in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/germans-held-cornelia-rau-for-weeks/2008/11/26/1227491636523.html|title=Germans held Rau for weeks|date=27 November 2008|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, Rau was arrested and imprisoned in Jordan after behaving erratically and refusing to pay bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/cornelia-rau-locked-up-in-jordan-20090220-8dm6.html|title=Cornelia Rau locked up in Jordan|date=21 February 2009|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richard Leape===
A male member of Kenja named Richard Leape, who was being treated for [[schizophrenia]], disappeared around 1993 and has not been seen since. His sister, Annette, says she once found him in the street "totally paranoid and irrational, saying Nazis were going to get him". She was concerned that many other people had "developed very serious mental illnesses" from their time in Kenja, and said she was "appalled" to know Kenja still exists.&lt;ref name="face"/&gt;

===Michael Beaver===
A young man who was a Kenja member for two years, Michael Beaver, was also diagnosed with (and hospitalised for) chronic schizophrenia. He blamed Kenja, and said he has heard of four other people who had severe problems since leaving Kenja. Beaver later killed himself, writing in his suicide note that Kenja was "partly to blame".&lt;ref name="lcouncil"/&gt;

==Apprehended violence orders==
Two [[Apprehended Violence Order]]-related court cases involving senior Kenja members have come before the courts.

===Case number one===
Senior members of Kenja Communication were cross-examined in a court case involving a father and his daughter, who made serious charges of sexual molestation against Dyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Davies | first = Lisa | title = Cult strikes back – Kenja critic assault a lie: court told | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 6 December 2007 | page = 35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kenja members claim to have been assaulted by the father was rejected by the court and the charges against the man were dropped.

===Jan Hamilton===
Jan Hamilton was cross-examined in a court case involving an alleged attempt to threaten a young girl, who had made serious sexual allegations against her husband, Kenneth Dyers, prior to his suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23922828-5006009,00.html| title=Woman's fake beard was 'bogus'| work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| date=26 June 2008| accessdate=11 September 2008 | first=Byron | last=Kaye}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 August 2008, the young lady, formerly a member of the Kenja group, successfully secured an [[Apprehended Violence Order#Australian apprehended violence orders|AVO]] against the co-founder of the group. Jan Hamilton was ordered not to stalk, harass, or intimidate the woman as part of a two-year AVO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/cults-bizarre-ploy-to-initimidate-nonbeliever/2008/08/26/1219516472353.html| title=Cult founder warned off after 'bizarre' audition ploy| work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]| date=27 August 2008| accessdate=11 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magistrate forwarded details of the trial to the attorney general, requesting an investigation on criminal grounds for perverting the course of justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s2658609.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton vigorously denied the allegations and indicated she would appeal the decision; however, no appeal was made to the AVO and Hamilton was ordered to pay legal costs, totalling $37,500, to the victim.

==Popular culture: film and media==
===''Beyond Our Ken''===
The Kenja group was the subject of the 2008 documentary ''[[Beyond Our Ken (2008 film)|Beyond Our Ken]]'', directed by [[Luke Walker (filmmaker)|Luke Walker]] and [[Melissa Maclean]]. The film was nominated for Best Documentary in 2008 by the Australian Film Institute and Film Critics Circle Australia. ''Beyond Our Ken'' was voted the third-most popular documentary at the Melbourne International Film Festival.

The international premiere of ''Beyond Our Ken'' at Toronto's [[Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival|Hot Docs Film Festival]] generated controversy when Kenja flew from Australia to protest at the screenings.

===Department of Defence===
Channel Ten News reported on a Defence Department spokesperson making the following statement in relation to the yearly advertisements placed in the Fairfax Press newspapers:
"The Army will contact Kenja Communication shortly to issue a notice to cease and desist using the Army's [[Rising Sun (badge)|Rising Sun Badge"]].

Most '''lead-based paint in the United Kingdom''' was banned from sale to the general public in 1992, apart from for specialist uses. Prior to this lead compounds had been used as the pigment and drying agent in different types of paint, for example brick and some tile paints

{{TOC right}}

==White lead paint==

Until the early 1960s white lead ([[lead carbonate]]/[[lead sulphate]]) was added in substantial quantities as the main white pigment in some paint products intended for use as a primer or top coat over metal and wood, both internally and externally.  Examples of where this type of paint may have been used are skirting boards, doors, door frames, stairs, banisters, window frames and sills, wooden flooring, radiators, and pipes, though it could also have been applied to any other surface at this time e.g. plaster walls.

Prior to this the concentration of white lead in paint rose to its highest levels between the years 1930 and 1955, as much as half the volume in some paints, meaning many post-war UK houses have significant amounts of lead in original paint layers.&lt;ref name="Independent Article"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/prperty-call-time-on-heavy-metal-poisoning-1144886.html |title=Prperty: Call time on heavy metal poisoning - Business, News |publisher=The Independent |date=1998-02-15 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, alternative white pigments, such as [[titanium dioxide]], were introduced.

In 1963 a voluntary agreement was made between the then Paintmakers' Association, now the British Coatings Federation, and the UK Government that resulted in labeling of paint that contained more than 1% of lead in dry film, with a warning that it should not be applied to surfaces accessible to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsh.sagepub.com/cgi/pdf_extract/104/2/64 |title=Lead in Paint - Brushed Aside? - Johnson et al. 104 (2): 64 - Perspectives in Public Health |publisher=Rsh.sagepub.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However white lead-based paints remained in the supply chain and were therefore still in use for some time.

Following this, white lead continued to be added to some paint available to professional decorators for specialist use. Additionally, paint with low white lead levels was applied as a thin [[primer coat]] to some pre-fabricated domestic wooden windows until the early 1980s.

In 1992 European Union legislation&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31989L0677:EN:HTML "Council Directive 89/677/EEC"], ''The Council of the European Communities'', 21 December 1989.  Retrieved on 2015-07-20.&lt;/ref&gt; was implemented within the UK by the Environmental Protection, part of the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (DEFRA), as the Controls on Injurious Substances Regulations.&lt;ref name="uksi199231"&gt;[http://legislation.data.gov.uk/uksi/1992/31/sld/made/data.htm?wrap=true "The Environmental Protection (Controls on Injurious Substances) Regulations 1992"], ''UK Government Statutory Instruments 1992 No. 31'', 9 January 1992.  Retrieved on 2015-07-20.&lt;/ref&gt; This prevented the addition of white lead to almost all paints except those intended for use in historic buildings and as artwork.

==Red lead==
The lead-based pigments ([[lead tetroxide]]/calcium plumbate, or "red lead") were widely used as an anti-corrosive primer coating over exterior steelwork. This type of paint might have been applied to garden gates and railings, guttering and downpipes and other external iron and steel work.

Similar red lead-based compounds were also widely used as a jointing compound in engineering, to form steam- or oil-tight flanged joints in pipework.

Red lead in paint was not banned by the 1992 legislation&lt;ref name="uksi199231" /&gt; or by more recent EU REACH regulations&lt;ref&gt;[http://echa.europa.eu/web/guest/regulations/reach/legislation "REACH Legislation"], ''[[European Chemicals Agency]]''.

Retrieved on 2015-07-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice however it has been replaced by safer alternatives (such as red oxide&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.higalv.co.uk/technical-issues-redoxide.asp "Technical Issues: Red Oxide"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150731020529/http://www.higalv.co.uk/technical-issues-redoxide.asp |date=2015-07-31 }}, ''Highland Colour Coaters Ltd''.  Retrieved 2015-07-20.&lt;/ref&gt;) by most UK/EU paint suppliers; and indeed of those that still supply it, some mistakenly assume it is covered by the 1992 regulations and request approval from a 'competent body' before purchase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://technicalpaintservices.co.uk/catalogue/Lead-Free-Paints-Primers-and-Undercoats-For-Historic-Buildings-and-Monuments/ "Paints, Primers and Undercoats for Historic Buildings"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627000241/http://technicalpaintservices.co.uk/catalogue/Lead-Free-Paints-Primers-and-Undercoats-For-Historic-Buildings-and-Monuments |date=2015-06-27 }}, ''Technical Paint Services''.  Retrieved on 2015-07-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coloured lead paint==
Until the early 1970s red, yellow, orange and green lead-based pigments ([[lead chromate]]) were added to a limited number of decorative coloured gloss and wall paints. Following this non-lead alternatives were used as pigments.

However lead chromate continued to be used in yellow road markings up to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://highwaysmagazine.co.uk/comment-end-of-the-road-for-lead-chromate-pigments/ "Comment: End of the road for lead chromate pigments?"], ''Highways Magazine'', Sevenoaks, England, November 2014.  Retrieved on 2015-07-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its use was supposed to cease on 21 May 2015, the sunset date set by EU REACH regulations.  However a last minute request for authorization by the Canadian pigment producer ''Dominion Colour Corporation (DCC)'' has had preliminary support by the [[European Chemicals Agency]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://chemicalwatch.com/23102/eu-paint-associations-oppose-lead-pigments-authorisation "EU paint associations oppose lead pigments authorization"], ''Chemical Watch'', 12 March 2015.  Retrieved on 2015-07-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://echa.europa.eu/addressing-chemicals-of-concern/authorisation/applications-for-authorisation-previous-consultations/-/substance-rev/1627/term "Adopted opinions and previous consultations on applications for authorisation"], ''[[European Chemicals Agency]]''.  Retrieved on 2015-07-20.&lt;/ref&gt; which if approved could see its use continue in road markings until 2022 or later.

==Lead drying agent==
Lead (lead [[naphthenate]]) was added as a [[oil drying agent|drying agent]] to some types of paint to ensure the paint surface hardened.&lt;ref name="Independent Article" /&gt; In the 1960s this practice was phased out for ordinary paint available to the general public, however its use has not (so far) been banned by legislation.

==Advocacy==
The Lead Paint Safety Association (LiPSA) is a [[not-for-profit]] UK organisation that aims to promote awareness and best practice in [[lead paint]] safety and compliance. LiPSA's objective is to prevent and ultimately to eliminate childhood and occupational lead poisoning. LiPSA was founded by Tristan Olivier.

LiPSA's members include individuals and organisations, especially those in the area of lead paint testing and removal and offers web-based, email and telephone advice in relation to lead paint, including testing strategies. LiPSA also offers an emergency telephone support line for child lead poisoning and/or occupational exposure concerns.

'''Lemkos''' ({{lang-uk|Лемки}}, ''Lemky''; {{lang-pl|Łemkowie}}; [[Lemko language|Lemko]]: Лeмкы, ''Lemkŷ'', &lt;small&gt;{{tooltip|sing.|Singular}}&lt;/small&gt; Лeмкo, ''Lemko'') are an ethnic group inhabiting [[Lemkivshchyna]], a part of [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]] (spanning [[Ukraine]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Poland]]).

Their affiliation with other ethnicities is controversial, although individual Lemkos generally self-identity as a sub-group of [[Rusyns]] and/or [[Ukrainians]]. Other ethnic groups identifying as Rusyn and/or Ukrainian include the [[Boykos]] and [[Hutsuls]]. Members of these groups have increasingly rejected official ethnic designations such as ''Verkhovyntsi'' (Highlanders), and/or as a sub-group of ''[[Ukrainians|Ukrainets]]'' (ethnic Ukrainian), in favor of the Rusyn identity; a trend that can be observed in official census statistics in Slovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://portal.statistics.sk/files/Sekcie/sek_600/Demografia/SODB/Tabulky/Tabulky_AJ_SODB/tab11.pdf|title=Table 11.

The spoken language of the Lemkos, which has a code of ''rue'' under ISO 639-3, has been variously described as a language in its own right, a dialect of [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]] or a dialect of [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]. In Ukraine, almost all Lemkos speak both Lemko and standard Ukrainian (according to the [[2001 Ukrainian Census]]).&lt;ref name="census2001" /&gt; Ukraine (unlike neighboring countries) denies Lemkos separate ethnic and linguistic status.&lt;ref&gt;[[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the Polish Census of 2011, 11,000 people declared Lemko nationality, of whom 6,000 declared only Lemko nationality, 4,000 declared double national identity – Lemko-Polish, and 1,000 declared Lemko identity together with a non-Polish identity.&lt;ref name="stat"&gt;''[http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/Przynaleznosc_narodowo-etniczna_w_2011_NSP.pdf Przynależność narodowo-etniczna ludności – wyniki spisu ludności i mieszkań 2011]''.

{{Main article|Lemkivshchyna}}
{{Ukrainians}}
The Lemkos' homeland is commonly referred to as ''[[Lemkivshchyna]]'' ({{lang-uk|Лeмкiвщина}}, [[Rusyn language|Lemko]]: ''Lemkovyna'' (Лeмкoвина), {{lang-pl|Łemkowszczyzna}}). Up until 1945, this included the area from the [[Poprad River]] in the west to the valley of [[Osława|Oslawa]] River in the east, areas situated primarily in present-day [[Poland]], in the [[Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Lesser Poland]] and [[Subcarpathian Voivodeship]]s ([[Administrative divisions of Poland|provinces]]). This part of the Carpathian mountains is mostly deforested, which allowed for an [[agrarian economy]], alongside such traditional occupations as ox grazing and sheep herding.

The Lemko region became part of Poland in [[History of Poland (966-1385)|medieval Piast times]]. Lemkos were made part of the Austria province of [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] in 1772.&lt;ref name="Levinson 1994 69"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levinson |first=David |editor1-first=David |editor1-last=Levinson |editor2-first=Norma |editor2-last=Diamond |title=Encyclopedia of World Cultures: Russia and Eurasia, China |series=Encyclopedia of World Cultures |volume=6 |year=1994 |publisher=G.K. Hall|location=[[Boston, Massachusetts]] |isbn=978-0-8161-1810-6 |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area was part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] until its dissolution in 1918, at which point the [[Lemko-Rusyn Republic]] (''Ruska Lemkivska'') declared its independence. Independence did not last long however, and the republic was incorporated into Poland in 1920.

As a result of the forcible deportation of Ukrainians from Poland to the Soviet Union after World War II, the majority of Lemkos in Poland were either resettled from their historic homeland to the prеviously German [[Former eastern territories of Germany|territories]] in the North-Western region of Poland or to the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]].&lt;ref name="pmid12292959"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kordan B |title=Making borders stick: population transfer and resettlement in the [[Trans-Curzon territories]], 1944–1949 |journal=[[The International Migration Review]] |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=704–20 |year=1997 |pmid=12292959 |doi=10.2307/2547293|jstor=2547293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only those Lemkos living the [[Prešov Region]] in present-day [[Slovakia]] continue to live on their ancestral lands, with the exception of some Lemkos who resettled in their homeland in the late 1950s and afterward. Lemkos are/were neighbours with [[Slovaks]], [[Carpathian Germans]] and ''Lachy sądeckie'' (Poles) to the west, [[Pogorzans]] ([[Poles]]) and ''[[Dolinians]]'' (a [[Rusyn people|Rusyn]] subgroup) to the north, [[Ukrainians]] to the east, and [[Slovaks]] to the south.

==Etymology==
The name "Lemko" derives from the common expression ''Lem (Лeм)'', which can mean "but", "only", or "like" in the ''Lemko'' dialect. This word is commonly used in many dialects mainly around eastern Slovakia, Polish and Ukrainian border, and is one distinction between the languages. "Lemko" came into use as an [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] after having been used as an [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] by the neighboring [[Lyshaks]], [[Boykos]] and [[Hutsuls]], who do not use that term in their respective dialects. The term in Slovak dialects would be Lemko, in Rusyn dialect it is Lemkiv, in Polish Lemkwich.

Prior to this name, the Lemkos and the Lyshaks described themselves as ''Rusnaks'' ({{lang-uk|Руснaки}}, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]] ''Rusnaky'') or [[Rusyns]] ({{lang-uk|Русини}}, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]] ''Rusyny''), as did the rest of the inhabitants of present-day Western Ukraine in the 19th century and first part of the 20th century. In the late 19th and continuing into the early 20th century, in order to differentiate themselves from ethnic Russians, Ruthenians/Rusyns began to use the ethnonym [[Ukrainians]] ({{lang-uk|Українці}}, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]] ''Ukrayintsi''). Some Lemkos have accepted the ethnonym, but many consider themselves to be a distinct ethnicity, while some continue to identify themselves as [[Rusyns]].

==History==
[[File:Peremozhne 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Monument commemorating the deportation of Lemkos. Peremozhne, [[Luhansk Oblast|Luhansk region]] ([[Ukraine]])]]
[[File:Akcja wisla cm01.jpg|thumb|200px|Tablet inscription in Polish (left) and Ukrainian: "In memory of those expelled from [[Lemkivshchyna]], on the 50th anniversary of [[Operation Vistula]], 1947–1997."]]

The ethnogenesis of the Lemkos is still being discussed by scholars. According to one theory, the Lemkos (and other Carpatho-Rusyns) are descendants of the [[White Croats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=MmneTsicGY348QOm7dzNBA&amp;ct=result&amp;hl=sr&amp;id=rnMOAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Prince+Laborec&amp;q=Laborec#search_anchor|title=Our people: Carpatho-Rusyns and their descendants in North America|first=Paul R.|last=Magocsi|author-link=Paul Robert Magocsi|date=30 July 2005|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Majorov |first=Aleksandr Vjačeslavovič |year=2012 |title=Velika Hrvatska: etnogeneza i rana povijest Slavena prikarpatskoga područja |trans-title=Great Croatia: ethnogenesis and early history of Slavs in the Carpathian area |language=Croatian |location=Zagreb, Samobor |publisher=[[Brethren of the Croatian Dragon]], Meridijani |isbn=978-953-6928-26-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Magocsi|first=Paul Robert|authorlink=Paul Robert Magocsi|title=With Their Backs to the Mountains: A History of Carpathian Rus? and Carpatho-Rusyns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nzj2DAAAQBAJ|year=2015|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-615-5053-46-7|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katchanovski|first1=Ivan|last2=Kohut|first2=Zenon E.|last3=Nebesio|first3=Bohdan Y.|first4=Myroslav|last4=Yurkevich|title=Historical Dictionary of Ukraine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-h6r57lDC4QC|year=2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7847-1|page=321|quote=In the opinion of some scholars, the ancestors of the Lemkos were the White Croatians, who settled the Carpathian region between the seventh and tenth centuries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Polish scholars claim that they developed from a [[Vlach]]/[[Romanians|Romanian]] migration in the 14th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Ewa Kocój, Heritage without heirs? Tangible and religious cultural heritage of the Vlach minority in Europe in the context of an interdisciplinary research project (contribution to the subject), Special volume IUS VALACHICUM, Poznań – Bucharest 2015, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a view that they are refugees from [[Ruthenia]] who moved to the Western side of the Carpathian Mountains in the 14th century to escape the Mongol invasion. Some scholars suggest that settlers from Rus' may have arrived earlier to the area traditionally inhabited by Lemkos.

Lemkivshchyna became part of Poland in [[History of Poland (966-1385)|medieval Piast times]]. Lemkos became an [[ethnic minority]] as part of the Austria province of [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] in 1772.&lt;ref name="Levinson 1994 69" /&gt; Mass emigration from this territory to the Western hemisphere for economic reasons began in the late 19th century. After World War I, Lemkos founded two short-lived republics, the [[Lemko-Rusyn Republic]] in the west of Galicia, which had a [[Ukrainian Russophiles|russophile]] orientation, and the [[Komancza Republic]], with a Ukrainophilic orientation.

&lt;!-- Needs more information between 15th and 20th centuries --&gt;
It is estimated that about 130,000 to 140,000 Lemkos were living in the Polish part of [[Lemkivshchyna]] in 1939. Additional depopulation of these lands occurred during the [[population transfer|forced resettlement]], initially to the [[Repatriation of Ukrainians from Poland to the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] (about 90,000 people) and later to Poland's [[Recovered Territories|newly acquired western lands]] (about 35,000) in the [[Operation Vistula]] campaign of the late 1940s. This action was a [[People's Republic of Poland|state ordered]] removal of the civilian population, in a [[counter-insurgency]] operation to remove potential support for [[guerrilla war]] being waged by the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (UPA) in south-eastern Poland.

While a small number of Lemkos returned (some 5,000 Lemko families returned to their home regions in Poland between 1957–1958,&lt;ref name=lemkorepublic&gt;[http://www.lemko.org/rzeczpospolita/hladyk.html Lemko Republic of Florynka / Ruska narodna respublika Lemkiv]&lt;/ref&gt; (they were officially granted the right to return in 1956), the Lemko population in the Polish section of Lemkivschyna only numbers around 10,000–15,000 today. Some 50,000 Lemkos live in the western and northern parts of Poland, where they were sent to populate former [[German people|German]] villages in areas ceded to Poland. Among those, 5,863 people identified themselves as Lemko in the 2002 census. However, 60,000 ethnic Lemkos may reside in Poland today. Within Lemkivshchyna, Lemkos live in the villages of [[Łosie, Gorlice County|Łosie]], [[Krynica-Zdrój]], [[Nowica, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Nowica]], [[Zdynia]], [[Gładyszów]], [[Hańczowa]], [[Zyndranowa]], [[Uście Gorlickie]], [[Bartne]], [[Binczarowa]] and [[Bielanka, Gorlice County|Bielanka]]. Additional populations can be found in [[Mokre, Sanok County|Mokre]], [[Szczawne]], [[Kulaszne]], [[Rzepedź]], [[Turzańsk]], [[Komańcza]], [[Sanok]], [[Nowy Sącz]], and [[Gorlice]].

In 1968 an [[:pl:Skansen Kultury Łemkowskiej w Zyndranowej|open-air museum dedicated to Lemko culture]] was opened in [[Zyndranowa]]. Additionally, a [[:pl:Łemkowska Watra w Żdyni|Lemko festival]] is held annually in [[Zdynia]].

==Population genetics==
There are a few studies of the genetics of Lemkos, and they suggest a common ancestry with other modern Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Willis
|first=Catherine |year=2006 |title=Study of the Human Mitochondrial DNA Polymorphism |journal=McNair Scholars Journal |volume=10 |issue=1 |url=http://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1071&amp;context=mcnair |accessdate=2009-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of maternal lineages found that Lemkos have the highest frequency of [[Haplogroup I (mtDNA)]] found to that date. [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|Haplogroup M*]] also reaches its regional peak among Lemkos.&lt;ref name="pmid19589018"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nikitin |first=AG |author2=Kochkin IT |author3=June CM |author4=Willis CM |author5=McBain I |author6=Videiko MY |year=2008|title=Mitochondrial DNA sequence variation in Boyko, Hutsul and Lemko populations of Carpathian highlands. |journal=[[Human Biology (journal)|Human Biology]]|volume=81 |issue=1|pages=43–58 |id=Unknown ID 0018-7143 |oclc=432539982 |pmid=19589018 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/human_biology/v081/81.1.nikitin.html |quote=Lemkos shared the highest frequency of [[Haplogroup I (mtDNA)|haplogroup I]] ever reported and the highest frequency of [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|haplogroup M*]] in the region.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lemko church.jpg|thumb|upright|The Shelestove St Michael's wooden church (1777) is the classic example of Lemko architecture.]] --&gt;

An important aspect of Lemko culture is their deep commitment to Eastern [[Christianity]] which was introduced to the Eastern Slavs from Byzantium via [[Kiev]] through the efforts of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] in the 9th century. Originally the Lemkos adhered to Orthodoxy, but in order to avoid latinization directly entered into union with Rome in the 17th century. Most Lemkos today are [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern rite or Byzantine-rite Catholics]]. In Poland they belong to the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] with a [[Roman Catholic]] minority, or to the [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic Church]] (see also [[Slovak Greek Catholic Church]]) in Slovakia. A substantial number belong to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Through the efforts of the martyred priest Fr. [[Maxim Sandovich]] (canonized by the Polish Orthodox Church in the 1990s), in the early 20th century, Eastern Orthodoxy was reintroduced to many Lemko areas which had accepted the Union of Brest centuries before.

The distinctive wooden architectural style of the Lemko churches (as opposed to their neighbouring sub-ethnic groups such as the Boikos) is to place the highest [[cupola]] of the church building at the entrance to the church, with the roof sloping downward toward the [[Sanctuary#Sanctuary as a sacred place|sanctuary]].

==Language==
[[File:Zyndranowa skansen.jpg|thumb|left|Lemko open-air museum in [[Zyndranowa]]]]

The Lemkos' language is considered by Ukrainian linguists to be the most western of [[Ukrainian dialects]]. The homeland occupied by the Lemkos has been influenced greatly by the languages spoken by neighboring or ruling peoples, so much so that some consider it a separate entity.&lt;ref&gt;See [[:uk:Лемківський говір]]{{Better source|date=May 2017|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars state that Lemko is the western-most dialect of the [[Rusyn language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rusyn.org/rusyns-language.html |title=The Rusyns |publisher=Rusyn |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Paul Joseph|editor1-last=Best |editor2-first=Jarosław |editor2-last=Moklak |title=The Lemkos of Poland : articles and essays |series=Carpatho-Slavic Studies |volume=1-3 |year=2000 |publisher=Carpatho-Slavic Studies Group, Historia Iagellonica Press |location=New Haven, Cracow |isbn=978-83-912018-3-1 |oclc=231621583}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn is considered by many Ukrainians to be a dialect of Ukrainian. Lemko speech includes some patterns matching those of the surrounding [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Slovak language]]s, leading some to refer to it as a transitional dialect between Polish and Slovak (some even consider the dialect in Eastern Slovakia to be a dialect of the Slovak language).{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

[[Metodyj Trochanovskij]] developed a Lemko Primer ('Bukvar: Perša knyžečka dlja narodnŷch škol', 1935) and a First Reader ('Druha knyžečka dlja narodnŷch škol', 1936) for use in schools in the Lemko-speaking area of [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Horbal |first1=Bogdan|authorlink1=Bogdan Horbal |editor1-first=Richard D.|editor1-last=Custer|editor1-link=|title=Rusyn-American Almanac of the Carpatho-Rusyn Society 10th Anniversary 2004–2005 |year=2005 |location=[[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] |pages=81–91|chapter=The Rusyn Movement among the Galician Lemkos|chapterurl=http://www.lemko.org/scholar/horbal/94.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, Lemko was introduced as the language of instruction in schools in the Lemko region. The pupils were taught from textbooks prepared by Trochanovskij and published by the State Publishing House. However, shortly before the outbreak of World War II Polish authorities replaced them with Ukrainian texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duć-Fajfer|first1=Helena|title=Szkolnictwo na Łemkowszczyźnie (Schooling in the Lemko region)|url=http://lemkowski.revitalization.al.uw.edu.pl/?sem=1&amp;topic=24|website=revitalization.al.uw.edu.pl|publisher=[[University of Warsaw]]|accessdate=2 June 2018|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important fieldwork on the Lemko dialect was carried out by the Polish linguist [[Zdzisław Stieber]] before their dispersal.

In the late 20th century, some Lemkos/Rusyns, mainly emigres from the region of the southern slopes of the Carpathians in modern-day Slovakia, began codifying a standard [[grammar]] for the Lemko dialect, which was presented on the 27 January 1995 in Prešov, Slovakia. In 2013 the famous novel [[The Little Prince]] was translated into Lemko by [[Petro Krynyckij]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petit-prince-collection.com/lang/show_livre.php?lang=en&amp;id=2812 Little Prince nr. PP-2812 / Lemkovian (petit-prince-collection.com)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Slovakia has more than 1,000,000 users of local dialects which would commonly use the word ''lem''.

[[Image:Lotos Club3.jpg|right|thumb|A ''[[table d'hôte]]'' menu from the dinner for [[Walter Damrosch]] at the Lotos Club, 1893.]]

The '''Lotos Club''' was founded as a [[gentleman's club]] in [[New York City]]; it has since also admitted women as members. Its founders were primarily a young group of writers and critics. [[Mark Twain]], an early member, called it the "Ace of Clubs".&lt;ref name="Lotos"&gt;[http://www.lotosclub.org/default.aspx?p=DynamicModule&amp;pageid=225172&amp;ssid=72888&amp;vnf=1 "The Lotos Club,"] official website. Accessed May 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Club took its name from the poem "The Lotos-Eaters" by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], which was then very popular. Lotos was thought to convey an idea of rest and harmony. Two lines from the poem were selected for the Club motto:

{{blockquote|In the afternoon they came unto a land

In which it seemed always afternoon&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lotosclub.org/Default.aspx?p=DynamicModule&amp;pageid=225180&amp;ssid=72896&amp;vnf=1 "The Lotos Club: History and Objectives,"] Lotos Club official website. Accessed May 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Lotos Club has always had a literary and artistic bent, with the result that it has accumulated a noted collection of American paintings. Its "State Dinners" (1893 menu at right) are legendary fetes for scholars, artists and sculptors, collectors and connoisseurs, writers and journalists, and politicians and diplomats. Elaborate souvenir menus are produced for these dinners.

The Lotos Club's first home was at Two [[Irving Place]], off of 14th Street near the [[Academy of Music (New York City)|Academy of Music]]. Journalist DeWitt Van Buren was the Lotos Club's first president; he was succeeded by [[A. Oakey Hall]]. Other early Club officers included Vice President F.A. Schwab, Secretary George Hows, and Treasurer Albert Weber. ''[[New York Tribune]]'' editor [[Whitelaw Reid]] was elected Club president in 1877,at which time the Lotos Club moved to 149 Fifth Avenue at 21st Street.

In 1893, the Club moved to 556-558 Fifth Avenue at 46th Street, purchasing their first clubhouse.

It was at the Lotos Club in 1906 that [[George Brinton McClellan Harvey|George Harvey]], editor of ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', sent up his first trial balloon by proposing [[Woodrow Wilson]] for the office of [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;A.S. Link, "Woodrow Wilson: The American as Southerner", ''The Journal of Southern History'', 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, with financial backing from [[Andrew Carnegie]], the clubhouse was moved to 110 West 57th Street, in a building designed by architect [[Donn Barber]].&lt;ref&gt;Architecture, Volume 19, number 6, page 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank R. Lawrence was the Club's longest serving president, from March 1889 until his death on October 26, 1918.&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;Price, Charles W. (Lotos Club Vice President). Letter to the editor, ''New York Times'' (June 29, 1927).&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence was succeeded as president by Chester S. Lord, who served for five years. In 1923, [[Columbia University]] president [[Nicholas Murray Butler]] was elected president of the Club.&lt;ref name="Price" /&gt;

The Club has a long history of showing the work of its artist members and has also held exhibitions of work from the collections of its members including one in 1910 that featured works by Degas, Monet, Renoir, Cassatt and Hassam.&lt;ref name="nyt 2014"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/realestate/rusty-traces-of-sumptuous-architecture-on-west-57th-street.html ''Where Fancy Took Flight: Rusty Traces of Sumptuous Architecture on West 57th Street'']. The New York Times (2014, July 17): retrieved July 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1941 the club held a mortgage-burning ceremony to mark payment of the $389,000 owed on the West 57th Street building.&lt;ref name="nyt 2014" /&gt; But in 1945 members began considering a move to a "simpler clubhouse."&lt;ref name="nyt 2014" /&gt; The club has been housed since 1947 in a 1900 clubhouse designed by [[Richard Howland Hunt]] at 5 East 66th Street. (The building had been commissioned by Margaret Shepard as a gift for her daughter, Mrs. William Jay Schieffelin.)

In 1977, the Club amended its constitution to admit women.

== Constitution ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1059">A '''mating connection''' is any method of assembling of two or more component parts with mutually complementing shapes that, with some imagination, resembles the way two animals, [[male]] and [[female]], are physically connected during the act of [[mating]]. In such connections one of the two components acts as male and the other as female, although more complex relationships exist.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Len F.

The '''Mokshas''' (also ''Mokshans'', ''Moksha people'', in {{Lang-mdf|Мокшет/Mokšet}}) are a [[Mordvins|Mordvinian]] [[ethnic group]] belonging to the [[Volga Finns|Volgaic]] branch of the [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] peoples&lt;ref&gt;[https://oa.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/42397/livingon.pdf?sequence=1 ]{{dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who live in the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], mostly near the [[Volga river|Volga]] and [[Moksha River|Moksha]] rivers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Finno-Ugric Peoples |last=Vuorela |first=Toivo |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1964 |publisher=Indiana University |location= |isbn= |page=221 |url=https://books.google.com/books?q=%22The+Mokshas+live+chiefly+on+the+west+side+of+the+Volga+and+to+the+south+of+the+great+bend%2C+particularly+along+the+Moksha+river%2C+a+tributary+of+the+Oka%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; a tributary of the [[Oka River]]. 

Their native language is [[Moksha language|Mokshan]], one of the two surviving members of the [[Mordvinic languages|Mordvinic]] branch of the [[Uralic language]] family. According to the 1994 Russian census, 49% of the autochthonal Finnic population in Mordovia identified themselves as Mokshas, totaling more than 180,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Goskomstat (1995): Goskomstat of Russia, 1994 Microcensus of Russia, topical results (8 volumes).

==Name==
[[File:Flag of the Moksha people.svg|thumb|Unofficial flag of the Moksha people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uralistica.com/profiles/blogs/flag-mokshan |title=Флаг мокшан |website=Uralistica.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Rubruck, the Franciscan monk who was sent to the Mongols, called them "Moxel". The same term is used in the Persian chronicle of [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid-al-Din]]. According to popular tradition the Russians first used the term "Mordva" to refer only to the Erzya people&lt;ref&gt;Jaimoukha p.12&lt;/ref&gt; but later used it for both the Erzyas and the Mokshas. The term "Moksha" begins to appear in Russian sources in the 17th century.

The Mokshas are known in local languages as: 
*''Мокшет'' or ''Мокшень ломатть'' ("Moksha people") in [[Moksha language|Moksha]]
*''Мокшане'' or ''Мордва-Мокша'' in [[Russian language|Russian]]
*''Muqşılar'' in [[Tatar language|Tatar]]
*''Мăкшăсем'' in [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]]
*''Мокшот'' in [[Erzya language|Erzya]]

==History==

===Prehistory===
The breakup of the Volga Finns into separate groups is believed to have begun around 1200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/387850/Moksha |title=Moksha &amp;#124; people |website=Britannica.com |date=2006-01-19 |accessdate=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Moksha people cannot be traced earlier because they did not possess a distinctive burial tradition before that time. According to archeological data, bodies in early Mokshan burials were oriented with their heads to the south. 
Herodotus mentions [[Androphagi]] living in the forests between the upper waters of the Dnieper and Don, north of [[Scythia]]; this people is believed to be identifiable with the Gorodets culture, and with the early Moksha, making Herodotus's report the first appearance of the Mokshas in written history.&lt;ref&gt;Kuussaari, Eero, Suomen suvun tiet, F. Tilgmann Oy, Helsinki 1935&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Бубрих Д. В. Можно ли отождествлять мордву с андрофагами Геродота? — Записки Мордовского научно-исследовательского института социальной культуры, Саранск, 1941, № 3, с. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus also describes the  Scythian-Persian war of 516-512 BC, which involved the entire population of the Middle Volga. During this war the [[Sarmatians]] forced out the [[Scythians]] and subdued some Moksha clans. During the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, [[Antes people|Antes]], [[Slavs]], Mokshas and Erzyas became the most numerous and powerful population in East Europe.&lt;ref name="fyod"&gt;Федорова М. В. Славяне, мордва и анты. Издательство Воронежского Университета, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 4th century, most Mokshas had joined the Hunnic tribal alliance, taken part in the defeat of the  Ostrogothic Empire in 377, and subsequently moved eastward and settled in Pannonia. Evidence of the Hunnic connection includes Mokshan battle harnesses, especially the bits and psalia, which are identical to early Hunnic battle harnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Ахмедов И. Р. Псалии в начале эпохи великого переселения народов // Культуры Евразийских степей вт. пол. I тыс. н. э.: (из истории костюма) . — Т. 2 . — Самара, 2001 — С. 220—222&lt;/ref&gt; Archeological data show that the boundaries of Moksha territory did not change between the fourth and 8th centuries. In 450, the Mokshas were in alliance with a people of the Middle Volga known as the [[Burtas]], who were possibly [[Alans]].&lt;ref&gt;Афанасьев Г. Е. Буртасы // Исчезнувшие народы. — М., 1988. — С.85-96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Афанасьев Г. Е.

===Middle Ages===
During the [[second Arab-Khazar War]] in 737, Arab armies under the command of [[Marwan ibn Muhammad]] reached the right bank of the Volga and came into conflict with the Burtas on their way to the left or "Khazar" bank of Volga.&lt;ref&gt;The History of the Jewish Khazars. New York: Schocken Books, 1967, p.84&lt;/ref&gt; Circa 889-890, the [[Khazars]] were at war with the Burtas, the [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] and the [[Pechenegs]]. In 913, after a war between the [[Arsiyah]] and the Rus' at [[Atil]] began, five thousand Rus' survivors escaped up the Volga where most of them were killed by the Burtas. In 932, the Khazar King Aaron formed a war alliance with the Oghuz. Circa 940, during the reign of [[Joseph (Khazar)|King Joseph]], the Khazars entered into an alliance with the Burtas.&lt;ref&gt;Zuckerman, Constantine.

He converted to [[Islam]], formed an alliance with the caliph of [[Baghdad]] [[Al-Muktafi]], and founded a trading post at the mouth of the [[Oka river]].&lt;ref&gt;В. А. Юрченков.

The latter was allied with Volga Bulgaria. Vladimirian princes captured and destroyed Obran Osh in 1221 and founded [[Nizhny Novgorod]] on the site. The Erzyan King [[Purgaz]] and the Mokshan King [[Puresh]] were at war and while Purgaz was allied with Volga Bulgaria, Puresh was an ally of Prince Yury.&lt;ref&gt;В. А. Юрченков. Мордовский народ: вехи истории. — Саранск, 2007. — с. 97-98&lt;/ref&gt; In 1230 Purgaz laid siege to Nizhny Novgorod but was defeated.

As recorded by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid-al-Din]] in his [[Jami al-Tawarikh]], 4 September 1236 was the date on which the sons of [[Jochi]] - [[Batu Khan|Batu]], [[Orda Khan|Orda]], and [[Berke]], [[Ugedei|Ugedei’s]] son [[Kadan]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai’s]] grandson [[Büri]], and [[Jenghiz Khan|Jenghiz Khan’s]] son Kulkan declared war on the Mokshas, Burtas and Erzyas. This war ended on 23 August 1237 with a crucial victory for the Mongols at the Black Forest close to the border of the [[Principality of Ryazan]].&lt;ref&gt;Лурье Я.С. 1) Общерусские летописи.

King Puresh of the Mokshans submitted to [[Batu Khan]] and was required personally to lead his army as a vassal in Mongol-Tartar military campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Six Emperors |last=Benson |first=Douglas |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1995 |publisher=University of Michigan |location= |isbn= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;ei=u1A7Sev3A5HKMufP3cMM&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=%22The+king+of+the+Mokshans+is+known+to+have+submitted+to+Batu%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the beginning of 1241 the Mongol army seized [[Kiev]], then crossed the [[Carpathian mountains]] and invaded [[Poland]]. [[Roger Bacon]] in his [[Opus Majus]]&lt;ref&gt;John Bridges. The "Opus Majus" of Roger Bacon. Elibron Classics, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; writes that the Mokshas were in the vanguard of the Mongol army and took part in the capture of [[Lublin]] and [[Zawichost]] in [[Poland]]. Benedict Polone reports that the Mokshan army suffered serious losses during the capture of [[Sandomierz]] in February and [[Krakow]] in March of the same year. On 9 April 1241 the Mongol army defeated the allied Polish and German armies at the [[Battle of Legnica]]. It is believed King Puresh was slain in that battle.&lt;ref&gt;В. А. Юрченков. Мордовский народ: вехи истории. — Саранск, 2007. — с. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after that battle the Mokshan army declared to Batu that they refused to fight against Germans. According to reports by William Rubruck and Roger Bacon, the Mokshas had previously negotiated with the Germans and Bohemians regarding the possibility of joining their side in order to escape from their forced vassalage to Batu.&lt;ref&gt;Itinerarium fratris Willielmi de Rubruquis de ordine fratrum Minorum, Galli, Anno gratia 1253. ad partes Orientales.&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that [[Subutai]] ordered the punishment of the conspirators; thousands of Mokshas were put to death, but approximately a third escaped and returned to their homeland. Another third remained in the vanguard of the Mongol army and marched into Hungary through the [[Verecke Pass]] in March 1242, according to the Hungarian bishop Stephan II&lt;ref&gt;Sinor D. Un voyageur du treizieme siecle: le Dominicain de Hongrie. — Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies. University of London, 1952, vol. XIV, part 3, p. 599)&lt;/ref&gt; and Matthew of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Paris, Matthew; Roger, of Wendover; H. R. Luard (editor).

==Geographic distribution ==
Mokshas live mostly in the central and western parts of the [[Mordovia|Republic of Mordovia]], and neighbouring areas of [[Tambov Oblast]] and in the western and central parts of [[Penza Oblast]]. Populations of Mokshas also live in [[Orenburg Oblast]], [[Bashkortostan]], [[Tatarstan]], [[Altai Krai]], as well as in diaspora communities in [[Estonia]], [[Kazakhstan]], the [[United States]], and [[Australia]].

==Culture==

===Mythology===
In traditional Mokshan mythology the world was created by ''Ińe Narmon'' (Great Bird), referred to in folklore as ''Akša Loksti'' (White Swan). The first thing ''Ińe Narmon'' created was water. ''Yakśarga'' (Duck) brought sand from the bottom of the sea and ''Ińe Narmon'' took the sand and with it formed the earth with ''Ińe Šufta'' (The Great Tree) on it. ''Ińe Narmon'' made its nest on ''Ińe Šufta'', which is usually referred to as ''Kelu'' (birch) in folklore. ''Akša Kal'' (White Sturgeon) carried the earth with the roots of ''Ińe Šufta'' on its back. ''Ińe Narmon'' had three nestlings: ''Tsofks'' (Nightingale), ''Kuku'' (Cuckoo),  and ''Ožarga'' (Skylark). ''Tsofks'' chose bushes and willows for his home, ''Kuku'' settled in the forest, and ''Ožarga'' went to the meadows. Another of the old deities mentioned in Mokshan folklore was ''Mešavane'' (Mother Bee). Since the Christianization of the Mokshans the Mokshan Supreme God has usually been called ''Värden Škai'' (Supreme Creator). 

According to later legends the creation of the world went through several stages: first the ''Idemevs'' (Devil) was asked by the God to bring sand from the bottom of the great sea. ''Idemevs'' hid some sand in his mouth. When ''Värden Škai'' started creating the earth, this hidden sand started to grow in the mouth of ''Idemevs''. He had to spit it out and thus chasms and mountains appeared on the previously level and beautiful earth. The first humans created by ''Värden Škai'' could live for 700–800 years and were giants 99 [[Obsolete Russian weights and measures|arshins]] (yards) tall.  The underworld in Mokshan mythology was ruled by ''Mastoratia''. The souls of heroes, clan elders and warriors slain in battle travelled after death to the emerald green isle of ''Usiya'', where they sat at a long table together with the great [[Tyushtya|King Ťušťen]] drinking pure mead.

{{further|Michif language}}
They share a common [[phonology]] and [[morphosyntax]] for the [[noun phrase]] but differ as to their sources for the [[verb phrase]] which is [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]-[[Cree language|Cree]] based in Michif, [[Canadian French|French]]-based in Métis French. Like Michif, Métis French is spoken in Manitoba and North Dakota and adjacent provinces or states. As a general rule, Métis individuals speak one or the other, rarely both.

Métis French is a variety of [[Canadian French]].

'''Petros Papadakis''' (born June 16, 1977) is an American television and radio personality, and co-host of the ''[[Petros and Money Show]]'' on [[Fox Sports Radio]] (FSN).  He is a former [[Halfback (American football)|tailback]] and team captain for the [[University of Southern California]] [[USC Trojans football|Trojans]] [[American football|football]] team.  He is the self-proclaimed "captain of the worst team in USC history."

== Football career ==

Papadakis's family has long-held ties to USC sports.  His father, John (Yiannis), and his brother, Taso, both played football at USC. His maternal grandfather, Dr. Ernest Schultz, played [[College basketball|basketball]] for the Trojans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.am570radio.com/pages/petros.html |title=AM 570 KLAC K-Los Angeles California/Orange County |publisher=Am570radio.com |date=October 16, 2009 |accessdate=August 25, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In spite of the family's close ties to USC, his younger brother Demetrius walked on to crosstown rival [[UCLA]]'s football team and was a member of the 2008 team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uclabruins.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/papadakis_demetrius00.html |title=UCLA Football Player Biography |publisher=UCLA.edu |year=2008 |accessdate=May 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829162702/http://www.uclabruins.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/papadakis_demetrius00.html |archivedate=August 29, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Petros planned to play football for the UCLA Bruins, but the Bruins lost interest in recruiting him and canceled his visit to campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbsun.com/sports/20101205/media-no-matter-how-hard-he-tries-papadakis-cant-please-everyone-at-usc-ucla |title=MEDIA: No matter how hard he tries, Papadakis can't please everyone at USC, UCLA | first=Tom | last=Hoffarth | work=The San Bernardino Sun | date=December 5, 2010 | accessdate=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papadakis started his college career at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He left the Cal Fall football training camp, undetected, in the middle of the night and hitchhiked back to [[Los Angeles]] after being homesick after one week.

While playing for [[University of Southern California]], Papadakis scored 16 [[touchdowns]].  In 1999 and 2000, he was named USC's team captain. However, he [[Broken bone|broke his foot]] in August 1999, requiring several  [[Surgery|operation]]s that caused him to miss that season.  After months of [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]], Papadakis returned in 2000. His teammates honored this accomplishment, voting Papadakis that season's "Most Inspirational Player."

In the [[2000 USC Trojans football team|2000 season]], USC won its opening game against [[Penn State]] in the [[Kickoff Classic]] with a score of 29–5 at the [[Giants Stadium|Meadowlands]].  Playing on his repaired foot, Papadakis scored a [[touchdown]] and gained 29 yards on 11 [[Rush (American football)|carries]].  The Trojans began the season 3–0 and were ranked 8th in the national polls.  But the team collapsed and finished with a 5–7 overall record.

The Trojans 2–6 conference record in 2000 was the only time the team finished in the last league position.  Since his first year in broadcasting, Papadakis has regularly called himself "the captain of the worst team in USC history".

During his university football career, Papadakis played in the 1998 [[Sun Bowl]], where the team lost to [[Texas Christian University]], scoring a touchdown during this game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usctrojans.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/papadakis_petros00.html |title=Player Bio: Petros Papadakis - University of Southern California Official Athletic Site |publisher=Usctrojans.cstv.com |date=June 16, 1977 |accessdate=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papadakis's first experience of broadcasting occurred when he was a tailback for the USC football team, where he became a popular interviewee among [[media in Los Angeles]]. When questioned about his popularity, Papadakis replied, "I just feel like the media is starved for somebody to say something different than, 'We really have to play hard this week.'  That’s all good stuff, but I deal with that in meetings every day.  I deal with that for six hours with coaches."

==Television career==
In 2002 and 2003 Papadakis continued broadcasting on FSN, and took employment as a [[sideline reporter]] for FSN's High School Game of the Week.&lt;ref name="foxsportsradio1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxsportsradio.com/pages/petrosandmoney.html |title=Petros &amp; Money |publisher=Fox Sports Radio |date= |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905193147/http://www.foxsportsradio.com/pages/petrosandmoney.html |archivedate=September 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became the host of the USC Magazine Show on FSN.

In 2004, [[Fox Sports Net]] hired him to [[Sports commentator|comment]] on national [[Pac-10]] games alongside [[Barry Tompkins]].&lt;ref name="foxsportsradio1"/&gt; Petros had no booth experience when FSN named him its top color analyst.

Papadakis hosted ''[[Pros vs Joes]]'' on [[Spike TV]] for three seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|id=0497304|title=Pros vs. Joes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2008, the network announced it would replace Papadakis with former [[New York Giants]] [[defensive end]] [[Michael Strahan]] for the show's fourth season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoffarth |first=Tom |url=http://www.insidesocal.com/tomhoffarth/archives/2009/01/papadakis-isn-t.html |title=Papadakis isn't the favorite 'Joe' any more ... it's Strahan and Glazer - Farther Off the Wall |publisher=Insidesocal.com |date=January 29, 2009 |accessdate=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2006 to 2010, Papadakis called a number of games as part of the California State High School Bowl Championship game on FSN.&lt;ref name=foxsportsbio/&gt;

In the autumn of 2007, Papadakis appeared on [[KNBC]] Channel 4 as [[Fred Roggin]]'s co-host on ''The Challenge'', which followed [[NBC]]'s ''[[Football Night in America]]'' on Sunday evenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sportsbybrooks.com/sbb-back-on-the-challenge-sunday-night-on-nbc-14870 |title=SbB Back On The Challenge Sunday Night On NBC |publisher=Sportsbybrooks |date=December 1, 2007 |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930142438/http://sportsbybrooks.com/sbb-back-on-the-challenge-sunday-night-on-nbc-14870 |archivedate=September 30, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has continued on the show since then, recently completing his 11th season on the show with Roggin.

Papadakis has been featured on several television networks including [[KTLA]], [[VH-1]], [[Game Show Network|GSN]], [[ESPN]] and [[E!]].  In 2005, he guest starred on the [[CBS]] hit series ''[[CSI: NY]]'', where he played a sports [[talk radio]] host.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb name|id=1540705|name=Petros Papadakis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Later on in life he starred in the [[Reality television|T.V. reality show]] ''Dennis Finds a Husband''.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

Currently, Papadakis provides analysis for Fox Sports on their college football telecasts as well as FS1's ''[[Fox Sports Live]]'' studio show.&lt;ref name=foxsportsbio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/presspass/bios/on-air/petros-papadakis|title=Petros Papadakis – Fox Sports PressPass|work=foxsports.com|accessdate=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio career==
Papadakis's first regular radio experience came in 1998 while he was a [[Junior (education)|junior]] tailback at USC.

In the summer of 2001, Papadakis began working on radio in addition to his TV duties. He co-hosted the weekly ''[[USC Insider]]'' with Pete Arbogast on the now defunct station [[KMPC|KMPC-1540 AM]], called "The Ticket". In 2002 and 2003 Papadakis was the sideline reporter for USC games, and in January 2003 hosted the "Bonus Hour".  Papadakis and Mark Willard co-hosted a show from 9-to-10am on [[weekday]]s.  Papadakis also became, and remains, a regular guest on the [[Kevin and Bean]] morning show on [[KROQ-FM]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].

In January 2004 "The Petros Papadakis Show" began on [[KMPC]]. It was produced by [[Craig Larson]] and featured Cornelius(CORN DOGG) Edwards and [[traffic reporter]] Sabina Mora. Brian Vieira became the show's [[television producer|producer]] in June 2005. 
  
"The Petros Papadakis Show" was known for Papadakis's musical parodies such as "[[I'm 'n Luv (Wit a Stripper)|I'm 'n Luv]] (Wit da [[Clippers]])" and "I Love Yee Doyers" (I Love the [[Dodgers]]). He was also known for his "Pop Culture Report", reporting the news of young celebrities in [[Hollywood]].

Papadakis resigned from his position at 1540 The Ticket in October 2006 to concentrate on his [[television broadcasting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130074436/http://www.trojanwire.com/football/petros-papadakis-leaves-1540am.php

 |accessdate=March 5, 2012
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within a month of his resignation, KMPC laid off most of its remaining local employees.  [[Sporting News Radio]] sold its interest in the station on March 30, 2007, and it became a [[Korean language]] station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynews.com/sports/ci_5656065 |title=ESPN's Morgan still thanking Robinson - LA Daily News |publisher=Dailynews.com |date= |accessdate=August 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523223435/http://www.dailynews.com/sports/ci_5656065 |archivedate=May 23, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 8, 2007 Petros returned to [[AM radio]] with an afternoon sports program on [[KLAC]], on 570&amp;nbsp;[[kHz]], a Los Angeles-based station, co-hosting the [[Petros and Money Show]] with [[Matt "Money" Smith]].  Two years later, the show was nationally syndicated because of a [[merger]] between [[Fox Sports Radio]] and KLAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.am570radio.com/cc-common/mainheadlines2.html?feed=137302&amp;article=1577550 |title=AM 570 KLAC K-Los Angeles California/Orange County |publisher=Am570radio.com |date= |accessdate=August 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719091618/http://www.am570radio.com/cc-common/mainheadlines2.html?feed=137302&amp;article=1577550 |archivedate=July 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his other media duties, Papadakis worked part-time for the USC men's basketball team as its [[public address]] [[Sports announcer|announcer]] from 2004–2016.

{{Violence against women}}
'''''Raptio''''' (in [[Archaic English|archaic]] or [[literary English]] rendered as '''''rape''''') is a [[Latin]] term for the large-scale abduction of women, i.e. [[kidnapping]] for [[marriage]] or [[enslavement]] (particularly [[sexual slavery]]). The equivalent term '''''Frauenraub''''', originally from [[German language|German]], is used in English in the field of [[art history]].

[[Bride kidnapping]] is distinguished from ''raptio'' in that the former is the abduction of one woman by one man (and his friends and relatives), whereas the latter is the abduction of women by groups of men, possibly in a time of war.

{{Wiktionary|rape}}

==Terminology==
The English word ''rape'' retains the Latin meaning in [[literary language]], but the meaning is obscured by the more current meaning of "sexual violation". The word is akin to ''rapine'', ''[[rapture]]'', ''[[wikt:raptor|raptor]]'', ''rapacious'' and ''ravish'', and referred to the more general violations, such as [[looting]], destruction, and capture of citizens, that are inflicted upon a town or country during [[war]], e.g. the [[Rape of Nanking]]. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gives the definition "the act of carrying away a person, especially a woman, by force" besides the more general "the act of taking anything by force" (marked as ''obsolete'') and the more specific "violation or ravishing of a woman".

English ''rape'' was in use since the 14th century in the general sense of "seize prey, take by force", from ''raper'', an [[Old French]] legal term for "to seize", in turn from [[Latin]] ''rapere'' "seize, carry off by force, abduct". The Latin term was also used for sexual violation, but not always. It is contested that the legendary event known as "[[The Rape of the Sabine Women]]", while ultimately motivated sexually, did not entail sexual violation of the Sabine women on the spot, who were instead abducted, and then implored by the Romans to marry them (as opposed to striking a deal with their fathers or brothers first, as would have been required by law).

Though the sexual connotation is today dominant, the word "rape" can be used in a non-sexual context in literary English. In [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', the title means "the theft of a lock [of hair]", exaggerating a trivial violation against a person. In the twentieth century, the classically trained [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] used the word with its old meaning of "seizing and taking away" in his ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. The [[Musical theatre|musical comedy]] ''[[The Fantasticks]]'' has [[The Fantasticks#Controversy|a controversial song]] ("It Depends on What You Pay") about "an old-fashioned rape". Compare also the adjective "rapacious" which retains the generic meaning of greedy and grasping.

In [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Roman Catholic canon law]], ''raptio'' refers to the legal prohibition of matrimony if the bride was abducted forcibly (Canon 1089 CIC).{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==History==
{{Further information|History of rape}}

The practice is surmised to have been common since anthropological antiquity. In [[Neolithic Europe]], excavation of the [[Linear Pottery culture]] site at [[Asparn an der Zaya|Asparn-Schletz]], [[Austria]], the remains of numerous slain victims were found. Among them, young adult females and children were clearly under-represented, suggesting that attackers had killed the men but abducted the [[nubile]] females.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhauer, U., ''Kulturwandel und Innovationsprozess: Die fünf grossen 'W' und die Verbreitung des Mittelneolithikums in Südwestdeutschland.'' Archäologische Informationen 22, 1999,
215-239; an alternative interpretation is the focus of [[abduction of children]] rather than women, a suggestion also made for the mass grave excavated at [[Thalheim, Saxony|Thalheim]]. See E Biermann, ''Überlegungen zur Bevölkerungsgrösse in Siedlungen der Bandkeramik'' (2001) {{cite web |url=http://www.rheinland-archaeologie.de/BiLBK03.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102122819/http://www.rheinland-archaeologie.de/BiLBK03.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abduction of women is a common practice in [[tribal warfare|warfare]] among [[tribal societies]], along with [[cattle raiding]]. In [[historical human migrations]], the tendency of mobile groups of invading males to abduct indigenous females is reflected in the greater stability of [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup]]s compared to [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup]]s. 
[[Image:Poussin RapeSabineLouvre.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Rape of the Sabine Women'', by [[Nicolas Poussin]], Rome, 1637-38 ([[Louvre Museum]])]]
The [[Rape of the Sabine Women]] is an important part of the [[Founding of Rome|foundation legends]] of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] (8th century BC). [[Romulus]] had established the settlement on the [[Palatine Hill]] with mostly male followers. Seeking wives, the Romans negotiated with the neighboring tribe of the [[Sabines]], without success. Faced with the extinction of their community, the Romans planned to abduct Sabine women. Romulus invited Sabine families to a festival of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune Equester]]. At the meeting he gave a signal, at which the Romans grabbed the Sabine women and fought off the Sabine men. The indignant abductees were implored by Romulus to accept Roman husbands. [[Livy]] claims that no sexual assault took place. He asserted that Romulus offered them free choice and promised civil and property rights to women. According to Livy he spoke to them each in person, "and pointed out to them that it was all owing to the pride of their parents in denying right of intermarriage to their neighbours. They would live in honourable wedlock, and share all their property and civil rights, and—dearest of all to human nature—would be the mothers of free men."&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.flash.net/~cohan/readings/Livysabine.html Livy: The Rape of the Sabines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311040505/http://home.flash.net/~cohan/readings/Livysabine.html |date=2008-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The women married Roman men, but the Sabines went to war with the Romans. The conflict was eventually resolved when the women, who now had children by their Roman husbands, intervened in a battle to reconcile the warring parties. The tale is parodied by English short-story writer [[Saki]] in ''The Schartz-Metterklume Method''.&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Munro (Saki), ''Beasts and Super-Beasts: Beasts'', available at {{cite web |url=http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/372/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106102640/http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/372/ |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also serves as the main plot of the movie [[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (film)|''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'']].

In [[Sanskrit literature]], the practice is known as ''[[Rakshasa]] Vivaha'' ("devil marriage"), mentioned e.g. by [[Kautilya]]. It is one of the eight forms of [[Hindu marriage]], the violent seizure or rape of a girl after the defeat or destruction of her relatives ([[Manu Smrti]] 3.33).

In the 3rd century, [[Gothic Christianity]] appears to have been initiated under the influence of Christian women captured by the [[Goths]] in [[Moesia]] and [[Thrace]]: in 251 AD, the Gothic army raided the Roman provinces of Moesia and Thrace, defeated and killed the Roman emperor [[Decius]], and took a number of (predominantly female) captives, many of whom were Christian. This is assumed to represent the first lasting contact of the Goths with Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Simek, Rudolf, ''Religion und Mythologie der Germanen'' (2003), p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Qur'an]], [[Islamic views on slavery#Concubinage|marriage to female prisoners of war who embraced Islam]] is recommended for those who cannot afford to marry other Muslim women according to [[Islamic marital jurisprudence|Islamic law]] ([[Sura 4]]:25).

Mutual abduction of women between Christian and Muslim communities was common in the [[Balkans under Ottoman rule]], and is a frequent theme in the [[Hajduk]] songs of the period.&lt;ref&gt;K. Simiczijev, ''Pieśń hajducka Słowian południowych'' ("the Hajduk songs of the South Slavs") 1985; review by Christo Vasilev, Jahrbuch für Volksliedforschung, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archbishop Samineni Arulappa''' (28 August 1924 – 13 February 2005), often shortened to '''S Arulappa''', was an [[India]]n [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] clergyman who served as the Archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hyderabad|Hyderabad]] from December 1971 through January 2000.  The youngest priest to be consecrated to such a high office, he was also the longest-serving Catholic Archbishop in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-1527836_ITM Access My Library, Former Archbishop Arulappa Passes Away]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also the first Archbishop who had the honour of being consecrated by [[Pope Paul VI]] in Rome (Showrayya 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;42-51).&lt;ref name="Showrayya"&gt;Showrayya, B.F., ''Archbishop S. Arulappa as I know him'', in silver jubilee souvenir published by Archdiocese of Hyderabad (1997), Archbishop's House, 9-1-17/1, Sardar Patel Road, Secunderabad 500 003, Andhra Pradesh, India&lt;/ref&gt;

''"Love and Serve"'' was his motto (Ecclesiastical Units 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;40-41).&lt;ref name="Ecclesiastical"&gt;Ecclesiastical Units 2008, Archdiocese of Hyderabad, Archbishop's House, 9-1-17/1, Sardar Patel Road, Secunderabad 500 003, Andhra Pradesh, India&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Arulappa was born on 28 August 1924 to Rajamma and Samineni Chinnaiah in Kilacheri in the state of [[Tamil Nadu]].  Earlier, his ancestors migrated southward from [[Gandikota]] after the defeat of the Gandikota rulers (Pemmasani surname) along with many other kamma families of different surnames and settled in that area. Some families migrated towards Guntur side.  When the state of [[Andhra Pradesh]] was formed, Kilacheri fell under [[Tamil Nadu]].

He was the last born in a family of four sisters, two of whom are [[nuns]], and two brothers (Arulappa, p.&amp;nbsp;5-6).&lt;ref name="Arulappa"&gt;Arulappa S., Archbishop, Love and Serve, Archdiocese of Hyderabad, Archbishop's House, 9-1-17/1, Sardar Patel Road, Secunderabad 500 003, Andhra Pradesh, India&lt;/ref&gt;  He was brought up in an atmosphere of strict discipline by his mother who wanted to see her only son become a Priest.  The Archbishop reminiscences that her mother looked forward to the day when she could see him as a Priest but both his parents died before he was ordained a priest. He was since supported by his brother Samineni Anthaiah (Arulappa, p.&amp;nbsp;37-40).&lt;ref name="Arulappa"/&gt;

===Seminary Studies===
Arulappa also evinced keen interest in pursuing the vocation of priesthood and also assisted the Priests as an altar boy during his childhood.  He was sent to the [[Kandy Pontifical College]] ''(Known as the Papal Seminary, it was built in 1893 by [[Pope Leo XIII]])'', [[Kandy]], [[Sri Lanka]] to pursue theological studies.&lt;ref name=papel&gt;[http://www.jnanam.org/homeoflove/html/st_bishops.htm Papal Seminary, Pune]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003065047/http://www.jnanam.org/homeoflove/html/st_bishops.htm |date=3 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Papal Seminary awarded Arulappa licentiate degrees in Philosophy and Theology ([[L. Ph.]] &amp; [[L. Th.]]) on successfully completing his studies there.&lt;ref&gt;Memorial card of Archbishop Arulappa, privately circulated on his memorial service in February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in 1955, the said College re-located to [[Pune]] ''[the Papal Seminary / Jnana Deepa Vidyapeeth is located in Ramwadi (Ahmednagar highway), Pune]''.

==Archbishopric==
* Archdiocese of Hyderabad

===Background===
G. Joseph Mark was the fifth Bishop of Hyderabad and later became Archbishop when the diocese of Hyderabad was elevated to an archdiocese on 19 September 1953 (Ecclesiastical Units 2008,  p.&amp;nbsp;39-40).&lt;ref name="Ecclesiastical" /&gt;  With his death on 28 February 1971, the office of the Archbishop fell vacant.

===Appointment===
[[File:Stjosephscathedralhyderabad.png|thumb|St. Josephs, the seat of the Archbishop of Hyderabad|right]]
[[Father (title)|Fr.]] S. Arulappa of the archdiocese of Madras-Mylapore was brought-in and nominated to the archbishopric of Hyderabad.

On 6 December 1971, he was appointed as the Archbishop of Hyderabad.  He was consecrated principally by [[Pope Paul VI]] and co-consecrators Cardinals Alfrink and Conway on 13 February 1972 at [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=cath /&gt;

Later, he was installed as the Archbishop of Hyderabad on 19 March 1972 in the All Saints' School Grounds in Abids, Hyderabad (Ecclesiastical Units 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;40-41).&lt;ref name="Ecclesiastical" /&gt;

Arulappa recollects that on 12 December 1971, he received a letter from the Apostolic Nunciature stating that he had been nominated as the Archbishop of Hyderabad and all that he could do was just kneel down and pray like never before.&lt;ref name="Arulappa" /&gt;

===Works===

====Parishes====
When the Archbishop took over the reins of the archdiocese, there were 18 parishes&lt;ref name="Arulappa" /&gt;  At the time of his retirement, there were 60 parishes which speaks about the work he undertook.

About 85 priests were ordained in the archdiocese during his Archbishopric.&lt;ref name="Arulappa" /&gt;

====Arrival of the Religious Congregations====
Altogether, 37 religious congregations were invited to work in the archdiocese.&lt;ref name="Arulappa"/&gt;

====Educational institutions====
Apart from the formation of the Hyderabad Archdiocese Education Society (HAES), 35 high schools and 14 junior and degree colleges were opened.&lt;ref name="Arulappa" /&gt;

====Structures====
* Arulappa was instrumental in founding the Hyderabad Archdiocese Social Service Society (HASSS) in 1973 which &lt;ref name=hindu/&gt; is involved in diverse developmental activities cutting across religious lines.
* Pastoral Centre
* Hyderabad Archdiocese Education Society (HAES)
* Amruthavani communications centre
* Andhra Pradesh Social Service Society

====Missionaries of Charity====
In the year 1974, the Archbishop visited Calcutta for a CBCI meeting and proceeded to invite Blessed Mother Teresa to work in the archdiocese of Hyderabad (Arulappa, p.&amp;nbsp;47-50).&lt;ref name="Arulappa" /&gt;  It was only in 1978 that the missionaries of charity started arriving in Secunderabad.  On 15 August 1978, the work of the Missionaries of Charity was inaugurated.  Later in January 1979, when [[Beatification|Blessed]] [[Mother Teresa]] arrived in Hyderabad for the first time, the Archbishop was there to receive her and later took her to the residence of the then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Dr. [[Marri Chenna Reddy]] who offered a part of a hospital in new Bhoiguda in Secunderabad for establishing a home for the dying destitute.&lt;ref name="Arulappa" /&gt;

====Erection of new dioceses====
During the archbishopric of Arulappa, the region of Andhra Pradesh saw the erection of five new dioceses.&lt;ref name="Arulappa" /&gt;

==Relations with the government==
Archbishop Arulappa did maintain good relations with the Government.  But when it came to laxity on the part of the Government, he used to take them to task through the media.

Secunderabad hosts the Presidents of India annually.  Rashtrapati Nilayam in Secunderabad is home to the Presidents during summers.  The Archbishop used to call on them during the President's sojourn to Secunderabad.  In the year 1982, the President [[Giani Zail Singh]] even visited the St. Mary's Church in Secunderabad on invitation by the Archbishop.&lt;ref name="Showrayya" /&gt;

==On secularism==
The Archbishop was known for his secular outlook.  He remarked that one should have respect for other religions&lt;ref name="Arulappa" /&gt; and used to maintain cordial relations with leaders of other religious affiliations and was even invited to various ''fora''.  He spoke at spiritual conferences organised by [[Swami Ranganathananda]] of the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] and [[Swami Chidananda Saraswati]] of the [[Divine Life Society]].he organised number of inter religious dialogues with various faiths according to his grand nephew P.L.Arulraj, state youth wing general secretary of B.J,P, of andhra pradesh

==On ecumenism and unity of the Church==
In 1973,&lt;ref name="ACTC"/&gt; Arulappa took part in the inauguration of the new campus of the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]] which was formed in 1964 consisting of the [[Anglican]], [[Baptist]], [[Congregational]], [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]] and [[Wesleyan]] Societies and involved the [[seminarians]] from the [[St. John's Regional Seminary]] to take part in the inaugural cultural programme.&lt;ref name="ACTC"&gt;[http://www.actchyd.com/milestones/ ACTC web site.  ''Milestones'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1977, he shared dais with the global evangelist Rev. Dr. [[Billy Graham]] and his associate Rev. Dr. Akbar Abdul Haqq during their conventions in Secunderabad.&lt;ref name="Arulappa" /&gt;  At another convention, he proposed common Eucharist among the Catholic and Protestant Churches.&lt;ref name="Arulappa" /&gt;  The Archbishop never used to turn down any invitation extended by the different Church societies belonging to either Catholic, Orthodox or Protestant backgrounds.  He considered himself as a Father to all.

The yearly United Christmas Celebrations organised by the laymen of the Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant backgrounds was the brainchild of the lay Methodists of Hyderabad.&lt;ref name="Roy"&gt;Roy, Raja Mohan, ''History of the United Christmas Celebrations'', 1990, Hyderabad&lt;/ref&gt;  Together, they approached the three Bishop's resident in Hyderabad, namely, Archbishop S. Arulappa, Bishop Victor Premasagar ([[Church of South India|CSI]] [[Bishop-in-Medak]]), and Bishop Elia Peter ([[Methodist]] Bishop of Hyderabad Regional Conference) who gave their nod and thus was born the United Christmas Celebrations, a yearly event to which either the [[Governor]] or [[Chief Minister]] of Andhra Pradesh are invited with participation by all the Churches of Hyderabad.&lt;ref name="Roy" /&gt;

==Membership==
''[[ex-officio]]''
* Catholic Bishop's Conference of India

===Episcopal silver jubilee===

On 8 February 1997, the Archbishop celebrated his episcopal silver jubilee in the grounds of St. Mary's High School in Secunderabad.  Eight regional bishops were also present.&lt;ref name="Arulappa" /&gt;  The book "Want to be a Hero" authored by the Archbishop was also released.

A Silver Jubilee Souvenir describing the achievements of Archbishop Arulappa was also released by the Archdiocese of Hyderabad entitled ''Archbishop Arulappa completes a Quarter Century'' with articles by:

==Writings==
* ''Want to be a Hero - Anecdotes with a message'', 1999, Amruthavani Publications, Secunderabad.
* ''The Ethics of Religious Conversions'', (with Dr. David Frawley), Pragna Bharathi, Hyderabad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pragna.org/dynamic/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=39 Pragna Bharathi, Hyderabad]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229090526/http://www.pragna.org/dynamic/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=39 |date=29 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Quoted in ''B. K. Kiran's Education in Human Values for the Twenty-first Century'', a NCERT publication&lt;ref&gt;National Council of Educational Research &amp; Training, Publication Abstract [http://ncert.nic.in/sites/publication/vechap4.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050808075434/http://ncert.nic.in/sites/publication/vechap4.htm |date=8 August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|...Perhaps the most fundamental and insidious challenge, is “lack of political will”. Archbishop of Hyderabad, the Rev. Samineni Arulappa (1999) perceives a reason behind this frequently lamented phenomenon: “Apparently there seems to be no political will to solve the problems of education. Many political leaders often seems to be not really interested to change the system. They are happy to keep the masses ignorant and illiterate. There are people who say that the Indian politicians and bureaucrats have never sincerely tried to educate the masses. Once education becomes compulsory and universal, people will be conscious of their rights and will not allow themselves to be exploited. They can elect their leaders on the basis of character, intellectual and moral excellence rather than region and religion.” Where will political will come from? Or, perhaps more pressingly, can anything be done about the increasing void of “character, intellectual and moral excellence” among the populace in the meantime?}}

==Ordination of women==
The eminent Catholic scholar and theologian Father [[John Wijngaards]], [[Mill Hill Missionaries|MHM]], [[Licentiate of Sacred Theology|L.S.S.]] ([[Rome]]), [[D. Th.]] ([[Rome]]) served as a lecturer in St. John's Regional Seminary, [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] from 1964-1976 during the archbishopric of Arulappa.  He espoused the ''cause'' of women priests.&lt;ref&gt;Association for the Rights of the Catholics in the Church, Catholic Priest resigns from the priestly ministry because of conflict of conscience, Press statement by John Wijngaards [http://arcc-catholic-rights.org/wijngaards.htm arcc-catholic-rights.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010708092213/http://arcc-catholic-rights.org/wijngaards.htm |date=8 July 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Archbishop Arulappa expressed his respect for women, he remained faithful to the stance taken by [[Holy See|Rome]] regarding women's ordination.  Speaking at the plenary of the [[Association of Theologically Trained Women of India]] (ATTWI), held at the Auditorium of Stanley Girls High School, Chapel Road, Hyderabad in the year 1999, he said that women in the Catholic Church were even given duties like Bible reading, offering communion, ''etc.'' and were also holding independent positions in religious orders and managing institutions.&lt;ref&gt;ATTWI handbook (2007) for Members&lt;/ref&gt;

Once, while addressing the Catholic Family Movement, he jocularly remarked that ''"God created man and rested.  He created woman and neither God or man rested.  That is the problem of all married people."''&lt;ref name="Showrayya" /&gt;  On another occasion, he remarked that ''"Women are only asking for equality.  I am one of those who say that women are actually superior to men !"''.  Were the Archbishop remarks veiled references to his upbringing in a family of four sisters and a mother ?

==Death==
Archbishop Arulappa died in Hyderabad at the age of 80.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2005/02/14/stories/2005021407740500.htm ''The Hindu, Andhra Pradesh'', Monday, 14 February 2005 "Archbishop Arulappa passes away"]&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance to his wishes stated in a will,&lt;ref name="hindu2" /&gt; he was buried in the altar in St. Mary's Church, [[Secunderabad]] on 14 February 2005.

'''Section 25 of the [[Constitution of Australia]]''' is a provision of the Constitution of Australia headed ‘Provision as to races disqualified from voting’ and providing that ‘For the purposes of the last section, if by the law of any State all persons of any race are disqualified from [[voting]] at [[Election|elections]] for the more numerous House of the [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|Parliament of the State]], then, in reckoning the number of the people of the State or of the [[Australia|Commonwealth]], persons of that race resident in that State shall not be counted.’ &lt;ref&gt;''Australian Constitution'' s 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The section was proposed in the [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|1890s constitutional conventions]] by [[Andrew Inglis Clark]] ([[Attorney-General of Tasmania|Tasmanian Attorney-General]]) who adapted the wording from a [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th-century amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|US constitution]].&lt;ref name="GeorgeWilliams"&gt;[http://www.altlj.org/publications/back-issues/2012-vol-37/product/762-removing-racism-from-australias-constitutional-dna/category_pathway-108 George Williams, ‘Removing racism from Australia’s constitutional DNA’ (2012) 37(3) Alternative Law Journal 151], p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

The section was intended to act as a penalty, so that if a state disqualified people of a certain race from voting, that state’s level of federal representation would suffer: However the fact that it acknowledges that states can in fact disqualify people on the basis of race, is antithetical to the concept of equality between [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous]] and non-Indigenous Australians.&lt;ref name="GeorgeWilliams" /&gt; Nevertheless, such discrimination remains legally possible under the Australian Constitution.

== Reform==

It has been suggested section 25 be deleted to remove the legal capacity to discriminate against Aboriginal people on the basis of their race.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altlj.org/publications/back-issues/2012-vol-37/product/762-removing-racism-from-australias-constitutional-dna/category_pathway-108 George Williams, ‘Removing racism from Australia’s constitutional DNA’ (2012) 37(3) Alternative Law Journal 151], p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

The ‘Expert Panel on Recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples in the Constitution’, in a report released in January 2012, also recommended that section 25 be deleted.&lt;ref name="Expert Panel"&gt;[http://www.youmeunity.org.au/uploads/assets/html-report/index.html Report of the Expert Panel on Recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples in the Constitution] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121129234148/http://www.youmeunity.org.au/uploads/assets/html-report/index.html |date=2012-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also recommended:
* the deletion of [[Section 51(xxvi) of the Australian Constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youmeunity.org.au/uploads/assets/html-report/index.html Report of the Expert Panel on Recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples in the Constitution] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121129234148/http://www.youmeunity.org.au/uploads/assets/html-report/index.html |date=2012-11-29 }}, p.137-156&lt;/ref&gt;
* the inclusion of three new sections – s 51A, s 116A and s 127A&lt;ref name="Expert Panel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asmi Wood, ‘[http://www.altlj.org/publications/back-issues/2012-vol-37/product/775-constitutional-reform-2013-what-are-we-trying-to-achieve/category_pathway-108 Constitutional Reform 2013: What are we trying to achieve?]’ (2012) 37(3) Alternative law Journal 156&lt;/ref&gt; (the original [[Section 127 of the Australian Constitution|section 127]] was repealed in 1967).

'''Advocacy &amp; Services for LGBT Elders (SAGE)''' is America's oldest and largest [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to improving the lives of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) [[older adults]], focusing on the issue of [[LGBT ageing]].  According to its mission statement, "SAGE leads in addressing issues related to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) aging. In partnership with its constituents and allies, SAGE works to achieve a high quality of life for LGBT older people, supporters and advocates for their rights, fosters a greater understanding of aging in all communities, and promotes positive images of LGBT life in later years."  SAGE is a [[501(c)(3)]] organization that focuses on advocacy on the local and federal levels, as well as activities, groups and programs that encourage LGBT older adults to stay connected with each other and the community.

==Leadership==
SAGE's leadership includes Executive Director, Michael Adams, former Director of Education and Public Affairs for [[Lambda Legal]].  SAGE's work is supported by a board of directors located throughout the U.S.  The current board chairs are [[Elizabeth F. Schwartz]] and Kevin Williams.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sageusa.org/about/board.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Incorporated by lesbian and gay activists and aging service professionals in 1978 as '''Senior Action in a Gay Environment''', SAGE (now Services &amp; Advocacy for GLBT Elders) is primarily located in [[New York City]] and has affiliates all over the [[United States of America]].  SAGE works with LGBT older adults and aging service providers to address and overcome the challenges of discrimination in older adult service settings.&lt;ref name="Ready to Serve"&gt;[http://www.n4a.org/pdf/ReadyToServe1.pdf Ready to Serve]&lt;/ref&gt;

SAGE is responsible for the nation's first Friendly Visiting program for frail and homebound LGBT older adults; the country's first support group for LGBT older adults with HIV; the nation's first program dedicated to caregiving services for LGBT older adults; the nation's first LGBT Senior Drop-In Center and the creation of the first national conferences devoted to LGBT aging concerns.

In 2010, SAGE became the recipient of a three-year, $900,000 grant from the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] and the [[Administration on Aging]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aoa.gov/aoaroot/Press_Room/For_The_Press/pr/archive/2010/February/lgbt.html U.S. Administration on Aging Press Release – February 10, 2010 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218233731/http://aoa.gov/AoARoot/Press_Room/For_The_Press/pr/archive/2010/February/lgbt.html |date=December 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to create the nation's only national resource center on LGBT aging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lgbtagingcenter.org National Resource Center on LGBT Aging]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edith Windsor|Edie Windsor]] was a vocal advocate for SAGE and former board member.

==Programs==
'''SAGE Centers'''
With funding from the New York City Council and the city's Department for the Aging (DFTA), SAGE opened the nation's first municipally funded senior center in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nation's first LGBT Senior Center opens in New York City|url = http://sdgln.com/social/2012/03/03/nations-first-lgbt-senior-center-opens-new-york-city#sthash.L8YIKoak.dpbs|website = San Diego Gay and Lesbian News|accessdate = 2015-10-30|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanded funding in 2014 allowed the opening of new centers in Brooklyn (with GRIOT Circle) and the Bronx, and expanded facilities in Harlem. There is also a full-time SAGE employee providing older adult programming at the Pride Center of Staten Island.  

'''Older Adults'''
SAGE's Clinical &amp; Social Services program offers individual and group counseling and comprehensive case management, while our Community Services program offers discussion groups, educational programs and social activities for more than 2,000 older adults. 

'''Caregivers'''
SAGE's Caregiver program provides a wide range of services for caregivers and care recipients.  SAGECAP (SAGE Caring And Preparing) was the focus of a [[New York City|New York]] citywide ad campaign in 2010 which won a [[GLAAD]] Media Award in Advertising for “Outstanding Social Marketing Campaign”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glaad.org/events/advertisingawards/nominees Second Annual GLAAD Media Awards in Advertising September 30, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SAGE Harlem'''
The SAGE Harlem Neighborhood Program is considered a NORC (Naturally Occurring Retirement Community) based not on geography but on affinity.  SAGE Harlem provides LGBT older adults in Harlem and allies opportunities for recreation and socializing, social services and support, educational opportunities and partners with neighborhood CBOs and senior centers to raise visibility and improve the quality of services. SAGE Harlem is located in the Oberia D. Dempsey Multi-Service Center at 127 West 127th Street in Harlem (and was formerly in the historic [[Hotel Theresa]], located at 2090 Seventh Avenue, Suite 201, New York, NY) and is part of [[New York City Department for the Aging]] blueprint for increasing the city’s livability for older New Yorkers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aging.ny.gov/EmpoweringCommunities/RegionalHappenings/NYCHappenings.cfm New York State Office for the Aging Accessed January 25, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117053433/http://www.aging.ny.gov/EmpoweringCommunities/RegionalHappenings/NYCHappenings.cfm |date=November 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advocacy &amp; Policy'''
By advocating for LGBT-affirming public policies, SAGE attempts to create a better life experience for older members of the LGBT community.  SAGE is working with its office in [[Washington, D.C.]] and national partners on legislation pertaining to the reauthorization of the [[Older Americans Act]] and [[Medicaid]] in 2011.

==SAGE STORY==
SAGE STORY, commenced in 2014, is a national digital storytelling program for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) elders. it was created to collect stories on the ways in which discrimination has affected LGBT older people. The initiative was limited at first to sites in North Carolina and Pennsylvania.  However, it fast grew beyond its initial tight focus, and it is now national. SAGE STORY draws on the unique life experiences of LGBT elders to offer fresh perspectives on aging, long-term care and LGBT rights. It is made possible through the support of AARP Foundation and The Ford Foundation. 

SAGE STORY offers LGBT elders four ways to pass on their experiences: Through photographs, podcasts, videos, and written articles.  What began as a small initiative focused on two states, now comprises LGBT elders throughout the country -- from every strata within small-town and rural America to big city and beyond.

==Publications==
SAGE has been involved in the following publications which have been helpful in garnering media coverage about the plight of LGBT older adults:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/wayoflife/03/17/gays.aging.problems/index.html?hpt=T2 CNN Aging issues can be tougher on gays May 14, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/gray-gay-and-worried/ New York Times.

[[File:Blood-feast.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Poster art for ''[[Blood Feast]]'' (1963), considered the first splatter film]]

A '''splatter film''' is a subgenre of [[horror film]] that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and [[graphic violence]]. These films, usually through the use of [[special effect]]s, display a fascination with the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by [[George A. Romero]] to describe his film ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'', though ''Dawn of the Dead'' is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.&lt;ref name="mccarty"/&gt;

During the late 20th and early-21st centuries, the use of graphic violence in cinema has been labeled "'''torture porn'''" or "'''gorno'''" (a [[portmanteau]] of "gore" and "porno").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boucher |first=Geoff |date=3 June 2007 |title=A queasy-does-it guy |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/03/entertainment/ca-eliroth3 |work=[[Los Angeles Times|latimes.com]] |accessdate=9 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120711231153/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/03/entertainment/ca-eliroth3 |archivedate=11 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, films such as ''[[Braindead (film)|Braindead]]'', ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' and to some extent ''Dawn of the Dead'', all of which feature over-the-top gore, can be construed as [[Slapstick comedy|comedic]], and fall into the category of '''splatstick'''.

==Characteristics==
Splatter films, according to film critic [[Michael Arnzen]], "self-consciously revel in the special effects of gore as an artform."&lt;ref name="arnzen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arnzen |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Arnzen |year=1994 |title=Who's Laughing Now?...The Postmodern Splatter Film |journal=Journal of Popular Film and Television}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where typical horror films deal with such fears as that of the unknown, the supernatural and the dark, the impetus for fear in a splatter film comes from physical destruction of the body and the pain accompanying it. There is also an emphasis on visuals, style and technique, including hyperactive camerawork. Where most horror films have a tendency to re-establish the social and moral order with good triumphing over evil, splatter films thrive on a lack of order. Arnzen argues that "the spectacle of violence replaces any pretensions to narrative structure, because gore is the only part of the film that is reliably consistent."&lt;ref name="arnzen"/&gt; These films also often feature fragmented narratives and direction, including "manic montages full of subject camera movement...cross-cuttings from hunted to hunter, and ominous juxtapositions and contrasts."&lt;ref name="arnzen"/&gt;

==Origins==
The splatter film has its aesthetic roots in French [[Grand Guignol]] theatre, which endeavored to stage realistic scenes of blood and carnage for its patrons. In 1908, Grand Guignol made its first appearance in England, although the gore was downplayed in favor of a more [[Gothic Romanticism|Gothic]] tone, owing to the greater censorship of the arts in Great Britain.&lt;ref name="mccarty"&gt;{{cite book |last=McCarty |first=John |year=1984 |title=Splatter Movies: Breaking the Last Taboo of the Screen |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=[[New York City]], New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first appearance of gore—the realistic mutilation of the human body—in cinema can be traced to [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916), which features numerous Guignol-esque touches, including two onscreen decapitations, and a scene in which a spear is slowly driven through a soldier's naked abdomen as blood wells from the wound. Several of Griffith's subsequent films, and those of his contemporary [[Cecil B. DeMille]], featured similarly realistic carnage.

===Modern era===
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the public was reintroduced to splatter themes and motifs by groundbreaking films such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960) and the output of [[Hammer Film Productions]] (an artistic outgrowth of the English Grand Guignol style) such as ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'' (1957) and ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Horror of Dracula]]'' (1958). Perhaps the most explicitly violent film of this era was [[Nobuo Nakagawa]]'s ''[[Jigoku (film)|Jigoku]]'' (1960), which included numerous scenes of flaying and dismemberment in its depiction of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] underworld [[Naraka]].

Splatter came into its own as a distinct subgenre of horror in the early 1960s with the films of [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]] in the United States. Eager to maintain a profitable niche, Lewis turned to something that mainstream cinema still rarely featured: scenes of visceral, explicit gore. In 1963, he directed ''[[Blood Feast]]'', widely considered the first splatter film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bankard |first=Bob |title=Making 'Blood Feast' |newspaper=Philly Burbs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15 years following its release, ''Blood Feast'' took in an estimated $7 million. It was made for an estimated $24,500.&lt;ref name="profoundly"&gt;{{cite book |last=Briggs |first=Joe Bob |authorlink=Joe Bob Briggs |date=28 June 2003 |title=Profoundly Disturbing: Shocking Movies That Changed History |publisher=Universe Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blood Feast'' was followed by two more gore films by Herschell Gordon Lewis, ''[[Two Thousand Maniacs!]]'' (1964) and ''[[Color Me Blood Red]]'' (1965).

The popularity of the splatter film in the 1970s was met with strong reactions in the US and the U.K.; Roger Ebert in the U.S. and Member of Parliament Graham Bright in the U.K. led the charge to censor splatter films on home video with the film critic going after ''[[I Spit on Your Grave]]'' while the politician sponsored the [[Video Recordings Act 1984|Video Recordings Act]], a system of censorship and certification for home video in the U.K.&lt;ref name="newman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Newman |first=Kim |authorlink=Kim Newman |year=2011 |title=Nightmare Movies |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |location=London}}, p.276&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the outright banning of many splatter films, which were deemed "[[video nasty|video nasties]]" in the British press.

Some splatter directors have gone on to produce mainstream hits. [[Peter Jackson]] started his career in [[New Zealand]] by directing the splatter movies ''[[Bad Taste]]'' (1987) and ''[[Braindead (1992 film)|Braindead]]'' (1992). These films featured such over-the-top gore that it became a [[comedic device]]. These comedic gore films have been dubbed "splatstick", defined as physical comedy that involves dismemberment. Splatstick seems to be more common in Japan, with the examples of ''[[Robogeisha]]'', ''[[Tokyo Gore Police]]'', and ''[[Machine Girl]]''.&lt;ref name="mccarty"/&gt;

[[File:CannibalHolocaustimpale.jpg|right|thumb|The 1980 mockumentary ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'', an influential example of splatter cinema.]]

Splatter films have pioneered techniques used in other genres. For example, the popular 1999 film ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' is similar to the 1980 film ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Deodato, Ruggero. Interview with Sage Stallone; Bob Murawski. "Cult-Con 2000", ''Cannibal Holocaust'' DVD commentary, Tarrytown, New York. 12 November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The story in ''Cannibal Holocaust'' is told through footage from a group of people making a documentary about a portion of the Amazon which is said to be populated by cannibals. Although the ''Blair Witch'' directors had not seen ''Cannibal Holocaust'' at the time of filming, this "[[mockumentary]]" format was later used in their film.

The success of torture porn, and its boom during the mid to late 2000s, led to a cross over into genres other than horror. This became evident with the release of many crime thrillers, particularly the 2007 film ''[[I Know Who Killed Me]]'' starring [[Lindsay Lohan]], and the 2008 film ''[[Untraceable]]'', starring [[Diane Lane]] and [[Billy Burke (actor)|Billy Burke]].&lt;ref&gt;Corliss, Richard (January 25, 2008).

By 2009, the box office draw of torture porn films had mostly been replaced in the U.S. by the profitable trend of remaking or rebooting earlier horror films from decades past with the modernization of films such as ''[[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' (2004), ''[[The Amityville Horror (2005 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' (2005), ''[[House of Wax (2005 film)|House of Wax]]'' (2005), ''[[Black Christmas (2006 film)|Black Christmas]]'' (2006), ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]'' (2007), ''[[My Bloody Valentine 3D]]'' (2009), ''[[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (2009), ''[[The Wolfman (2010 film)|The Wolfman]]'' (2010), ''[[The Crazies (2010 film)|The Crazies]]'' (2010), and ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010 film)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;Bowles, Scott (February 13, 2009), "[https://www.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20090213/horror13_st.art.htm Classic horror films come back to life, profitably] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917140437/http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20090213/horror13_st.art.htm |date=2009-09-17 }}".

Subsequently, torture porn has increasingly become a DVD-oriented subgenre. For example, ''[[Hostel: Part III]]'' (2011) was released direct-to-DVD, unlike the previous films in the series. The film received less negative attention in the press as a result of its lower-profile release.&lt;ref name= "TorturePorn"/&gt; Other recent torture porn films include ''[[Would You Rather (film)|Would You Rather]]'' (2012), ''Shiver'' (2012), and ''[[The Collection (2012 film)|The Collection]]'' (2012). As fewer and fewer high-profile cinematic torture porn films are being released, the subgenre is slowly dying out as many journalists have proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Brookes  (2009) ‘Audiences Laughed to Forget Troubles’, ''The  New  York Times'', December 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre elements was also used in episodes of many popular American television shows, including Fox's [[24 (TV series)|24]], [[CBS]]'s [[Criminal Minds]], [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime's]] [[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]], [[The CW]]'s [[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]], [[NBC]]'s [[Blindspot (TV series)|Blindspot]] and [[FX (TV network)|FX's]] [[American Horror Story]].

Some scholars have published analyses of torture porn films. For example, a book chronicling the torture porn phenomenon and the surrounding controversy – Steve Jones' ''Torture Porn: Popular Horror after Saw''&lt;ref name= "TorturePorn"/&gt; – was published in 2013.

The '''Standard Club''' is a private country club, founded as the Concordia Association in 1867. Originally located in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], United States, the club is now located in the northern suburb of [[Johns Creek, Georgia|Johns Creek]].

==History==
The club started as the Concordia Association in 1867 in [[Downtown Atlanta]]. Their premises, the 1892 Concordia Hall, are still standing in the [[Hotel Row]] historic district. In 1905 it was reorganized as the Standard Club and moved into the former mansion of [[William C. Sanders]] on the east side of Washington Street, between Fair Street (now Memorial Drive) and Woodward Avenue. The neighborhood, [[Washington-Rawson]], became the heart of the Jewish community until the 1920s. It was later razed to make way for the [[Downtown Connector]] interchange with [[I-20]] and for [[Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium]] and its parking lots (now [[Turner Field]] and its parking lots).

In the late 1920s the club moved to [[Ponce de Leon Avenue]] in [[Midtown Atlanta]]. The site was later acquired by its neighbors, the Yarrab [[Shriners|Shrine]] temple.

In the late 1940s, new quarters opened near [[Brookhaven, Georgia|Brookhaven]], in what is now the [[Lenox Park, Georgia|Lenox Park]] business park&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bo9y9O1DwuQC&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;pg=PA152#v=onepage Atlanta and Environs: A Chronicle of Its People and Events, 1940s-1970s By Harold H. Martin]&lt;/ref&gt; and was located there until 1983, when Atlanta Inc. and Technology Park redeveloped the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcollections.library.gsu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/atlphotos/id/3958|title=Cathy Davis Speaking at Neighborhood Meeting Concerning the Standard Club, August 9, 1983 :: Planning Atlanta - A New City in the Making 1930s-1990s Photographs|website=digitalcollections.library.gsu.edu|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the five buildings that form the headquarters of [[AT&amp;T Mobility]] form a circle overlooking what was once the club's golf course and its lake.

In the 1980s, the club moved to its present location in Johns Creek.

'''Turks in Kyrgyzstan''' are ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks]] who live in [[Kyrgyzstan]].

== History ==
The majority of [[Turkish people|Turks]] were deported from [[Meskheti|south-western Georgia]] to [[Central Asia]] in 1944, where they were employed largely in the agricultural sector in grain and livestock production. Of the 207,500 Meskhetian Turks registered in the [[Soviet Census (1989)|1989 Soviet census]], there were 21,294 [[Turkish people|Turks]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]].&lt;ref name="Babak 2004 loc=252"&gt;{{Harvnb|Babak|Vaisman|Wasserman|2004|loc=252}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Economic systems sidebar}}

An '''unplanned economy''' is an economy where economic decisions regarding production, investment and resource allocation are not linked together through conscious [[economic planning]]. This may refer to [[Subsistence economy|subsistence-level economies]], systems of [[barter]] or to more complex arrangements such as [[market economies]], and hypothetical systems such as [[Self-managed economy|self-managed]], distributed and [[network economies]]. Note that there may be a significant amount of planning within firms in market and [[Mixed economy|mixed-market]] economies.

'''Valencians''' ({{lang-ca-valencia|valencians}}, {{lang-es|valencianos}}) are an indigenous [[Italic peoples|Romance]] ethnic group whose homeland is the [[Valencian Community]], which is recognised as an historical nation in eastern [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Art. 1 of the Valencian Statute of Antonomy: "''El poble valencià, històricament organitzat com a Regne de València, es constituïx en Comunitat Autònoma, dins de la unitat de la nació espanyola, com a expressió de la seua identitat diferenciada com a nacionalitat històrica i en l'exercici del dret d'autogovern que la Constitució Espanyola reconeix a tota nacionalitat, amb la denominació de Comunitat Valenciana.''"&lt;/ref&gt; The official languages of Valencia are [[Valencian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref name="official-languages"&gt;Art. 6.2 of the [http://www.cortsvalencianes.es/descarga/destacados/ESTATUT.pdf Valencian Statute of Autonomy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927092440/http://www.cortsvalencianes.es/descarga/destacados/ESTATUT.pdf |date=27 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Valencian Community]] is politically divided in three provinces, from south to north: [[Alicante (province)|Alicante]], [[Valencia (province)|Valencia]] and [[Castellón (province)|Castellón]]. The current version of the Valencian [[Statute of Autonomy]] declares the Valencian Community a ''[[Nationalities and regions of Spain|nationality]]'' of Spain, and its capital is the city of [[Valencia]].

==Historical background==
{{see also|Crown of Aragon|Kingdom of Valencia}}
In 1237, the Moorish taifa of Valencia was taken by king [[James I of Aragon|James I the Conqueror]] of the [[Crown of Aragon]]. The population of the new kingdom was by far mostly Muslim, so the crown started a campaign of repopulation of the lands with Christians, as usual in the ''[[Reconquista]]''. The new Christian arrivals came from [[Catalonia]] and [[Aragon]]. Aragonese presence was most dominant in the interior parts of the kingdom (as can be assumed by geographical factors); those Aragonese from the eastern comarcas of Aragon (Matarranya, Casp, Baix Cinca, Llitera and Ribargorça) would have brought with them Catalan language varieties, whereas the rest of Aragonese settlers would've brought eastern Spanish and Aragonese varieties which would mix into Churro Spanish, which in much of the interior is the traditional language, as Valencian is in the coast, where most of the new inhabitants had [[Catalan people|Catalan]] or, less usual, [[Occitania|Occitan]] origins.

The [[Vega Baja del Segura|Bajo Segura]] and Vinalopó comarcas were a territory disputed between the crowns of Castile and Aragon since the ''Reconquista'', this being because they were conquered by Aragon but reserved for Castile under a treaty, hence they were repopulated by people from both crowns at different times, and the Alto Vinalopó ([[Villena]] influence area) was actually part of Murcia ([[Province of Albacete|Albacete province]]) until the nineteenth century. Following the Black Death and later the Expulsion of the Moriscos, the then Valencian-speaking Bajo Segura (to which [[Orihuela]] and [[Torrevieja]] belong) is said to have been resettled mostly by people from the Murcia region, eventually defining the language border there (see [[Murcian Spanish|Panocho dialect]]). The Requena comarca was, like the Alto Vinalopó, part of Castile ([[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca province]]) until the mid-nineteenth century (1851).

Moorish presence in the Kingdom of Valencia was very high, making one third of the entire population at the time of the expulsion (the highest proportion in all of Spain). The coexistence between the [[Christian]] and [[Muslim]] was mostly good, despite some chapters of religious intolerance like the massive [[Baptism]] of Muslims during the first [[Revolt of the Brotherhoods]]; however, Valencian Moors never ceased to speak Arabic. The Christian Valencian elites disapproved the King Philip plans of Expulsion of the Moriscos in 1609, because the sudden lack of the traditional workforce would lead to the kingdom's ruin.

== Demographics ==
{{double image|right||74||130|Traditional custome of Valencians}}
The Valencian population traditionally concentrated in localities with [[fertile soil|fertile]] cultivation and growing lowlands by the most important rivers ([[Júcar]], or ''Xúquer'' in Valencian, [[Turia River|Turia]], or ''Túria'', [[Segura]] and [[Vinalopó]]), also in harbour cities important to the agricultural trade.

The most important population centers used to be, during the Roman times, [[Sagunto]] (''Sagunt'') or [[Dénia]]; later on in history, [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] (''València''), [[Alicante]] (''Alacant''), [[Xàtiva]], [[Orihuela]] (''Oriola'') [[Elche]] (''Elx''), [[Gandia]], or [[Vila-real]] and, more recently, [[Alzira, Valencia|Alzira]] and [[Castellón de la Plana]] (''Castelló de la Plana'').

The population density which is higher in the central and southern regions and minor in the northern and inner ones, is derived from the traditional distribution of people which originated
in the orographic characteristics of the Valencian territory and the possibility to obtain irrigated land agriculture. Demographics were also affected by (being perhaps the exception to the mentioned distribution) the great industrial activity and the commerce of agriculturally derived products during the 20th century of noncoastal cities like [[Alcoy, Spain|Alcoy]] (''Alcoi''), [[Elda]], [[Ontinyent]], [[Petrer]], [[Villena]], and [[La Vall d'Uixó]].

In the last years, concentration in the great capitals and its metropolitan areas has augmented considerably (e.g. [[Torrent, Valencia|Torrent]], [[Mislata]], [[Paterna]], [[Burjassot]], [[Sant Vicent del Raspeig]], etc.) especially in all the coastal cities and towns. Thus, traditionally small populations such as [[Benidorm]] or [[Torrevieja]] have undergone a considerable population increase (still more remarkable during summertime) due to the seasonal migration of tourists.

==Languages==
{{main|Valencian language}}
[[Image:Subdialectes del valencià.svg|thumb|right|185px|[[Valencian|Valencian dialects]].]]

Valencian and Spanish are the official languages of Valencia. Spanish is the official language of the Spanish state, while Valencian, a variety of the [[Catalan language]], is the language considered by the Statute of Autonomy as ''llengua pròpia'' ("own language" or "language proper" to the territory). Valencian is traditionally spoken in the densely populated coastal areas rather than inland, where many places have Spanish as their traditional language, also those areas incorporated into the provinces of Alicante and Valencia at their creation in 1833 and which did not form part of the historical Kingdom of Valencia. Consequently, the 1984 Law on the "Use and Education of Valencian" defines certain municipalities as "predominantly Spanish-speaking", and allows them some few optional exceptions as to official use of Valencian, even though the right to use and to receive education in Valencian is guaranteed by the Statute of Autonomy (Art. 6.2) anywhere in Valencia.

==Cuisine==
{{main|Valencian cuisine}}
[[Paella]] is a rice dish which originated in [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] near lake [[Albufera]], a lagoon in eastern Spain.&lt;ref name="Info about Paella on About.com"&gt;[http://spanishfood.about.com/od/maincourses/a/paella.htm Info about Paella on About.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Valencians consider paella their main [[national dish]].

Other famous Valencian dishes are the [[orxata]] drink, and the [[bunyols]]: the sweet pastry eaten in [[falles]].

'''''Woman Hating: A Radical Look at Sexuality''''' is a 1974 book by the American [[radical feminism|radical feminist]] author and activist [[Andrea Dworkin]].

==Background==
While Dworkin was living in [[Amsterdam]] in the Netherlands, she met Ricki Abrams, a prostitute and a fellow expatriate. Abrams introduced Dworkin to early radical feminist writing from the United States, and Dworkin was especially inspired by [[Kate Millett]]'s ''[[Sexual Politics]]'', [[Shulamith Firestone]]'s ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'', and [[Robin Morgan]]'s ''[[Sisterhood is Powerful]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, ''Life and Death'', p. 19; Dworkin, ''Heartbreak'', p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; She and Abrams began to work together on "early pieces and fragments" of a radical feminist text on the hatred of women in culture and history,&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, ''Woman Hating'', Acknowledgment, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; including a completed draft of a chapter on the pornographic [[counterculture]] magazine ''Suck'', which was published by a group of fellow expatriates in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, ''Life and Death'', p. 21; Dworkin, ''Heartbreak'', p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before she left Amsterdam, Dworkin spoke with Abrams about her experiences in the Netherlands, the emerging feminist movement, and the book they had begun to write together. Dworkin agreed to complete the book—which she eventually titled ''Woman Hating''—and publish it when she reached the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, ''Life and Death'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In her memoirs, Dworkin relates that during that conversation she vowed to dedicate her life to the feminist movement:

{{quotation|Sitting with Ricki, talking with Ricki, I made a vow to her: that I would use everything I knew, including from prostitution, to make the women's movement stronger and better; that I'd give my life to the movement and for the movement. I promised to be honor-bound to the well-being of women, to do anything necessary for that well-being. I promised to live and to die if need be for women. I made that vow some thirty years ago, and I have not betrayed it yet.|Andrea Dworkin|Heartbreak: The Political Memoir of a Feminist Militant, 122.}}

==Synopsis==
Dworkin examines the place and depiction of women in fairy tales and pornography (focusing on the French erotic novels [[Story of O]] and [[The Image (novel)|The Image]] and the magazine ''Suck''). She then looks at the historical practices of Chinese [[Foot binding|foot binding]] and Medieval European [[Witch burning|witch burning]] from a radical feminist perspective. The book's final section discusses the concept of androgyny within various cultures' creation myths and argues for "the development of a new kind of human being and a new kind of human community" free from gender and gendered roles.

'''Women in Thailand''' were among the first women in [[Asia]] who were granted the [[right to vote]] in 1932. They are underrepresented in [[Politics of Thailand|Thai politics]].&lt;ref name=TDRI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Iwanaga/&gt;  [[Yingluck Shinawatra]], a woman, was prime minister from 2011 to 2014. The roles of women in Thailand's national development has not yet been fully established. Factors that affect women's participation in the socio-economic field include "inadequate gender awareness in the policy and planning process" and social stereotyping.&lt;ref name=GS/&gt;

==Politics==
Despite of the absence of legal limitations to women participating in the politic arena of Thailand, the factors that have impeded the rise of women in political activities include structural barriers, cultural impediments, lower educational attainments, lower socio-economic status,&lt;ref name=GS&gt;[http://web.nso.go.th/eng/en/stat/gender/gender00.htm Key Figures], Gender Statistics, Social Statistics Division, National Statistical Office, Bangkok.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OWIP&gt;[http://www.onlinewomeninpolitics.org/womensit/thai.pdf Women's rights situation in Thailand]&lt;/ref&gt; and power-sharing issues with the opposite sex.&lt;ref name=GS/&gt; It was only on June 5, 1949 that [[Orapin Chaiyakan]] became the first woman to be elected to hold a post in the [[National Assembly of Thailand|National Assembly of the Kingdom of Thailand]] (specifically, the [[House of Representatives of Thailand|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=TDRI&gt;Sopchokchai, Orapin. [http://www.tdri.or.th/library/quarterly/text/d98_2.htm Female Members of Parliament, Women's Political Participation at the National Level], Women's Political Participation in Thailand, TDRI Quarterly Review, Vol. 13, No. 4, December 1998, pp. 11-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Iwanaga&gt;Iwanaga, Kazuki. [http://www.lu.se/images/Syd_och_sydostasienstudier/working_papers/Iwanaga.pdf Women in Politics in Thailand], Working Paper No. 14, Centre for East and South-East Asian Studies, Lund University, Sweden, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;)

The first female army officer to be elected to political office in Thailand was Lt. Col. Thita Manitkul (2001-2005).

==Business==
In the realm of entrepreneurship, Thailand's female population comprised 47% of the country’s workforce, which makes up the highest percentage of working women in the region of the Asia-Pacific.  However, these women are also confronted by hiring discrimination and [[Gender inequality in Thailand|gender inequality]] in relation to wages because of being "concentrated in lower-paying jobs".&lt;ref name=GS/&gt;&lt;ref name=OWIP/&gt;

==Marriage==
{{See also|Thai marriage}}

According to the [[National Statistical Office of Thailand]], female Thais marry at an earlier age than male Thais, and that 24% of Thai households have women identified as "heads of households".&lt;ref name=GS/&gt;

==The evolution of women's rights==
In Thailand, women's rights according to [[Labor relations|labor]] laws require that men and women get paid for the amount of work they do.  In 1974, [[Kanitha Wichiencharoen]] became a founder of The Association for the Promotion of the Status of Women (APSW), an association made up of both women and men, who campaigned to revise and amend laws to provide better protections for women and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Falk|first=Monica Lindberg|title=Making Fields of Merit: Buddhist Female Ascetics and Gendered Orders in Thailand|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mQ2_t8TMcAoC&amp;pg=PA207|year=2007|publisher=[[Nordic Institute of Asian Studies|NIAS Press]]|location=Copenhagen, Denmark|isbn=978-87-7694-019-5|pages=207-208}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1977 constitution]] women were required to receive equal rights and protections. However, some inequalities remain in the law. There are no laws [[prohibiting]] women from holding office however there are very few women holding office. The biggest problem for [[gender inequality]] is when it comes [[domestic violence]] and [[Human trafficking|trafficking]]. [[Sexual harassment]] became illegal in 1998, but there are few reported cases and very few that are prosecuted because of the difficulties involved in proving a case. [[Domestic laws]] are still to be enacted in the constitution and the requirement for evidence of domestic abuse makes it nearly impossible to prosecute. Traditionally, a girl's education took place mostly in the home, coupled with domestic chores, while boys usually went to a [[Buddhist]] [[monastery]] for education. Education overall for business and careers is lacking in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Thailand Culture http://www.everyculture.com/SaTh/Thailand.html&lt;/ref&gt;
