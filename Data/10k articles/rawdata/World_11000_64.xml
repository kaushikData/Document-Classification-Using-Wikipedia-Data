'''ABC Australia''' is a [[Southeast Asia]]n [[pay television]] channel, launched in 1993 and operated by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]].&lt;ref name="australiaplus.com"&gt;{{cite press release | title = About Us {{!}} Australia Plus TV | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date = 29 September 2014 | url = http://tv.australiaplus.com/about | accessdate = 30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel broadcasts a mix of programming, including lifestyle, drama, sports, English-language learning programs, children's programming and news and current affairs.

It is partially funded by Australia's [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]], as well as some advertising (unlike the ABC's [[ABC Television (Australia)#Free-to-air channels|domestic television services]]). It is part of the ABC's International, Corporate Strategy and Governance division.&lt;ref name="intldivision"&gt;{{cite press release | title = ABC Bolsters Its Commitment To International Broadcasting | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date = 7 February 2007 | url = http://abc.net.au/corp/pubs/media/s1842867.htm | accessdate = 25 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
'''Australia Television International''' the forerunner to '''Australia Network''' was launched on 17 February 1993.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} [[Radio Australia]] had been operating as part of the ABC since 1939 while the passing of the '''Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act''' in 1983 allowed the Corporation to operate an additional international television service. The channel was originally proposed by directors [[Mark Armstrong (television executive)|Mark Armstrong]] and [[David Hill (businessman)|David Hill]], who felt that a television channel would further heighten Australia's presence in the Asia-Pacific region and demonstrate the ABC's technical abilities.&lt;ref name="whoseabc"&gt;{{cite book |last=Inglis |first=Kenneth Stanley |title=Whose ABC? The Australian Broadcasting Corporation 1983–2006 |year=2006 |publisher=Black Inc. |location=Melbourne, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] |isbn=1-86395-189-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new channel was to be funded by a combination of government subsidies and commercial sponsorship.&lt;ref name="whoseabc" /&gt; The presence of commercials, not previously seen or heard on the ABC, resulted in the creation of an updated edition of the ''ABC Editorial and Programme Practices'' stipulating that the 'Australia Television service will retain editorial control and independence in all programming'.&lt;ref name="whoseabc" /&gt; [[Paul Keating]] launched Australia Television International on 17 February 1993 – televised live to 50 countries in the southeast Asian region, from the ABC's television studios in [[Gore Hill, New South Wales|Gore Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pmtranscripts.pmc.gov.au/release/transcript-8818 Launch of ABC Television International, Gore Hill, Sydney], [[Prime Minister of Australia]], 17 February 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding cuts made in the 1997–1998 federal budget, and recommendations made in the Mansfield Report, meant that control of Australia Television was handed over to the [[Seven Network]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt; Under Seven's direction the channel continued to receive federal funding, and carry some [[ABC News and Current Affairs|ABC News]].&lt;ref name="mr" /&gt;

===2002–2006 – As ABC Asia Pacific===
Despite efforts made by Seven to expand into Asia using the service, it continued to lose money. In 2002, the government announced a five-year, $50 million tender for the service&lt;ref name="mr" /&gt; – at the time watched primarily by Australian expats for its news programmes, football coverage, and children's programming.&lt;ref name="mr"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.abc.net.au/rn/mediareport/stories/2001/265031.htm|title = PM – Channel Seven axes Australia TV|accessdate = 25 September 2007|date=March 2001|work = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven chose not to bid, while [[Imparja Television]]'s application was unsuccessful. The ABC won the contract and replaced '''Australia Television''' with '''ABC Asia Pacific''' on 1 January 2002, with content from the [[Seven Network]], [[Nine Network]], [[Network Ten]], and the ABC's own original content, as well as news bulletins produced by [[Sky News Australia]].&lt;ref name="downerspeech"&gt;{{cite speech | title = Australia, the Asia-Pacific, and Television: Broadcasting to the Region |first = Alexander | last = Downer | date = 13 February 2002 | location = Canberra | url = http://www.foreignminister.gov.au/speeches/2002/020213_fa_austv_launch.html | accessdate = 25 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070830061526/http://www.foreignminister.gov.au/speeches/2002/020213_fa_austv_launch.html| archivedate= 30 August 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ausnet-press"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.abc.net.au/corp/pubs/media/s512844.htm|title = ABC Signs ASIA Pacific TV agreement|accessdate = 25 September 2007|date=August 2001|work = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tender was renewed in 2005 however the ABC was re-awarded control of the service, over other applicants including '''[[Sky News Australia]]'''.&lt;ref name="mediawatch"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1378484.htm|title = Sky's push for Asian subsidy|accessdate = 25 September 2007|date=June 2005|work = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070924083241/http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1378484.htm| archivedate= 24 September 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dfatrelease"&gt;{{cite press release | title = Australian Television Service to the Asia Pacific Region | publisher = [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] | date = 13 December 2005 | url = http://www.foreignminister.gov.au/releases/2005/fa153_05.html | accessdate = 25 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070830035612/http://www.foreignminister.gov.au/releases/2005/fa153_05.html| archivedate= 30 August 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the network stopped showing content from Sky News Australia, replaced with bulletins produced by the ABC's own news and current affairs division from its [[ABV-2|Southbank]] studios in Melbourne.

===2006–2014 – As Australia Network===

ABC Asia Pacific changed its name to '''Australia Network''' on 7 August 2006,&lt;ref name="ausnet-press-2"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://abc.net.au/corp/pubs/media/s1682937.htm|title = New Australia Network Offers Different View|accessdate = 25 September 2007|date=October 2006|work = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time introducing a number of new programs, as well as the expansion of its existing news programs and English-language learning programs.&lt;ref name="ausnet-press-2" /&gt; Following a restructure of the ABC in early 2007, Australia Network became a part of the Corporation's International, Corporate Strategy and Governance division.&lt;ref name="intldivision" /&gt;

The channel was not available in Australia or [[New Zealand]], owing to rights restrictions, although ''ABC News for Australia Network'' bulletins were carried overnight on [[ABC News 24]] and [[Al Jazeera English]] in Australia and on [[Face TV]] in New Zealand. Several Australia Network programmes are also available online in Australia on the [[ABC iview|ABC's iview]] platform. Australia Network became available in [[Malaysia]] on [[Astro (satellite TV)|Astro]] (Channel 514) in December 2008.

===2014–2018 – As Australia Plus===
In the 2014 Australian federal budget, all funding to the Australia Network was cut and its closure was announced, days before it was about to sign a contract with Shanghai Media Holdings to begin broadcasting in China (making it only the third foreign broadcaster with access to the country).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The demise of the Australia Network|url=http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2014/05/16/The-demise-of-the-Australia-Network.aspx|accessdate=15 August 2014|publisher=Lowy Institute for Public Affairs|date=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 80 jobs, mostly in Melbourne, were lost and the government was forced to compensate the Australian Broadcasting Corporation 10 million dollars for breaking its contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eighty jobs to go at ABC News and Australia Network|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/eighty-jobs-to-go-at-abc-news-and-australia-network-20140714-zt6t8.html|accessdate=15 August 2014|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC to get $10.6m for cancellation of Australia Network contract|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/13/budget-abc-to-get-106m-for-cancellation-of-australia-network-contract|accessdate=15 August 2014|publisher=The Guardian|date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the closure of Australian Network, '''Australia Plus''', a new multi-platform international service was launched on 29 September 2014 as a replacement. The channel continued to broadcast entertainment, sports, education and English learning shows from [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] through Asia and Pacific partners. Big events from Australia, such as Melbourne Cup, Sydney's New Year's Eve Fireworks and the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race were also featured on the channel.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-28/australia-network-goes-off-the-air/5774808&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018–present – As ABC Australia===
Australia Plus was rebranded as '''ABC Australia''' on 1 July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Knox |first1=David |title=Australia Plus channel to rebrand as ABC Australia |url=https://tvtonight.com.au/2018/06/australia-plus-channel-to-rebrand-as-abc-australia.html |accessdate=18 July 2018 |work=TV Tonight |date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABC Head of International Strategy David Hua said, “The rebranding of the international television service makes sense to our audiences overseas, who want distinctive Australian content from a highly-respected media organisation.” The rebranding came just weeks after the lifting of the geo-blocking of the ABC News live stream on the ABC website and YouTube channels.

==Programming==
In addition to those listed below, the now rebadged ABC Australia shows a range of programming targeted at audiences within the region,&lt;ref name="ausnet-press-3"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://australianetwork.com/about/|title = About – Our Services|accessdate = 25 September 2007|work = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071004224810/http://australianetwork.com/about/| archivedate= 4 October 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; including evening news bulletins at two-hour intervals targeted at different parts of the region, and a number of English-language educational programs produced by the Network including ''Study English'', ''Living English'', ''English Bites'' and ''The Business of English''.&lt;ref name="programming"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k6/july/july124.htm|title = ABC Asia Pacific to launch as Australia Network on 7 August|accessdate = 25 September 2007|work = Indiantelevision.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drama series shown include ''[[Home and Away]]'', ''[[Offspring (TV series)|Offspring]]'', ''[[Packed to the Rafters]]'', ''[[Rake (Australian TV series)|Rake]]'', ''[[The Doctor Blake Mysteries]]'', ''[[The Time of Our Lives (TV series)|The Time of Our Lives]]'', factual entertainment programs ''[[Bondi Vet]]'', ''[[One Plus One (TV program)|One Plus One]]'', and ''Cosmo Times'', lifestyle programs ''[[Coxy's Big Break|Big Break]]'', ''[[Food Safari]]'' and ''[[Poh's Kitchen]]'', music program ''[[Rage (TV program)|Rage]]'', light entertainment programs ''[[Gruen Planet]]'', ''[[Good Game (television series)|Good Game]]'' and ''[[Good Game: Spawn Point|Good Game SP]]'', the children's shows ''[[Play School (Australian TV series)|Play School]]'', ''[[Blue Water High]]'', ''[[A gURLs wURLd]]'', and ''[[Scope (Australian TV series)|Scope]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia Network Programming|url=http://australianetwork.com/guide/programs_az.htm|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The news programming of the channel is produced and broadcast from the ABN news studios in Sydney, the headquarters of the ABC News channel and the network news service.

The '''Academy of Sciences and Literature''' ({{lang-de|Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur Mainz, AdW Mainz}}) is a [[Academy of Sciences|scientific academy]] in [[Mainz]], [[Germany]]. It was established in 1949 on an initiative of [[Alfred Döblin]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adwmainz.de/die-akademie.html |title=Die Akademie |language=German |publisher=Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur |accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy is an affiliation of personalities from science, literature and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |date=2018 |title=adw-mainz |url=https://www.akademienunion.de/en/adw-mainz/ |work=Union of the German Academies of Sciences and Humanities |location=Berlin |access-date=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy’s goal is to support science and literature, and in doing so to help preserve and promote culture. It is divided in three classes: mathematics and natural sciences, humanities and social sciences, literature and music. Each class has up to 50 full and 50 corresponding members. It actively promotes interdisciplinary discourse, facilitates research projects and organizes a variety of public events. Notable members have been [[Niels Bohr]], [[Otto Hahn]], [[Konrad Lorenz]], [[Halldór Laxness]], [[Heinrich Böll]], und [[Jean-Marie Lehn]].&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

'''Arctic cooperation and politics''' are partially coordinated via the [[Arctic Council]], composed of the eight Arctic nations: the [[United States of America]], [[Canada]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Russia]], and [[Denmark]] with [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]].&lt;ref name ="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt; The dominant governmental power in Arctic policy resides within the executive offices, legislative bodies, and implementing agencies of the eight Arctic nations, and to a lesser extent other nations, such as United Kingdom, Germany, European Union and China. [[NGO]]s and Academia play a large part in Arctic policy. Also important are intergovernmental bodies such as the [[United Nations]] (especially as relates to the [[Law of the Sea Treaty]]) and [[NATO]].

Though Arctic policy priorities differ, every Arctic nation is concerned about sovereignty and defense, resource development, shipping routes, and environmental protection. Though several boundary and resource disputes in the Arctic remain unsolved, there is remarkable conformity of stated policy directives among Arctic nations and a broad consensus toward peace and cooperation in the region.&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy.com"&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/08/16/think_again_the_arctic?page=full] Think Again: The Arctic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt; Obstacles that remain include [[United States non-ratification of the UNCLOS]] and the harmonizing of all [[UNCLOS]] territorial claims (most notably extended continental shelf claims along the [[Lomonosov Ridge]]); the dispute over the [[Northwest Passage]]; and securing agreements on regulations regarding shipping, tourism, and resource development in Arctic waters.

The Arctic Council membership includes the eight Arctic nations and organizations representing six indigenous populations.&lt;ref name ="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt; It operates on consensus basis, mostly dealing with environmental treaties and not addressing boundary or resource disputes. (Although the [[Arctic Search and Rescue Agreement]] was signed in May&amp;nbsp;2011, the Council's first binding document). A more robust Arctic Council with decision-making power on pan-Arctic resource and other issues has been proposed.

==Arctic Policies of Select Nations==

===United States of America (Alaska)===
{{Main|Arctic policy of the United States}}
Main goals in U.S. Arctic Policy are: National security; Protecting the Arctic environment and wildlife; Ensuring economic development is environmentally sustainable; Strengthening cooperative institutions among the eight Arctic nations; Including the Arctic’s indigenous communities in decisions; and Improving scientific monitoring and research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1420&amp;categoryid=D7F89003-AEDB-FB2E-B842E72D6D2C5C60&amp;fuseaction=topics.events_item_topics&amp;event_id=513866] US Arctic Policy&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 2009, President Bush signed National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-66 on Arctic Region Policy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/nspd/nspd-66.htm] US Arctic Region Policy Presidential Directive&lt;/ref&gt; a collaborative effort replacing the Clinton era Arctic policy directive. NSPD-66 is currently the active Arctic policy playbook being pursued by the Obama Administration and its Departments.

The U.S. Arctic Policy Group is a federal interagency working group comprising those agencies with programs and/or involvement in research and monitoring, land and natural resources management, environmental protection, human health, transportation and policy making in the Arctic.

State Department’s Office of Ocean and Polar Affairs (OPA) is a part of the State Department’s Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES). OPA is responsible for formulating and implementing U.S. policy on international issues concerning the oceans, the Arctic, and Antarctica.

===Canada (NWT, Nunavut, and Yukon)===
{{Main|Arctic policy of Canada}}
Canada has more Arctic land mass than any country.
On August 23, 2010, Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper said protection of Canada's sovereignty over its northern regions was its number one and "non-negotiable priority" in Arctic policy.&lt;ref&gt;

===Russia===
{{Main|Arctic policy of Russia}}
In&amp;nbsp;2007, Russia planted a flag on the Arctic Ocean seafloor beneath the North Pole while performing research to substantiate its claim to an extended continental shelf. The flag planting was perceived erroneously to be a land claim—a claim Canada and other Arctic nations rebuked even though the Russian Government clearly stated that no such claim was made. In&amp;nbsp;2009, a Russian government policy document cited western reports of a potential for military conflict over Arctic resources.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
Despite having lost 18 percent of its population between 1989 and 2002, the Russian Arctic comprises 25% of Russia's landmass and still contains 80&amp;nbsp;percent of the four million people who inhabit the planet's Arctic region.&lt;ref name="csis.org"/&gt;
Russia's current Arctic policy is contained in the document "Basics of Russian Federation State Policy for the Arctic Through 2020 and Beyond" signed on 18 September 2008 by Russian President (now Prime Minister) Medvedev.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arctis-search.com/Russian+Federation+Policy+for+the+Arctic+to+2020 Russian Federation Policy for the Arctic to 2020]&lt;/ref&gt;  This policy document addresses various issues tied to the protection and development of the land and offshore waters of Russia's Arctic sector.

===European Union===
{{Main|Arctic policy of European Union}}
If [[Accession of Iceland to the European Union]] occurs, the EU will increase its Arctic influence and possibly gain permanent observer status in the Arctic Council. [[The Northern Dimension]] of European Union policy, established in the late 1990s, intended to deal with issues concerning western Russia, as well as to increase general cooperation among the EU, Iceland and Norway. It has since become a multilateral, equal partnership among the EU, Iceland, Norway and Russia. Canada and the United States are observers to the partnership.  Three [[Nordic Council]] members have joined the EU (Denmark in 1973 and Sweden &amp; Finland in&amp;nbsp;1995). The European Union’s application to become a “permanent observer” in the Arctic Council was blocked in 2009 by Canada in response to the European Union’s ban on the importation of seal products.&lt;ref name="csis.org"/&gt;

===China===

==Other Arctic treaties and agreements==
[[Image:Iceberg with hole near Sandersons Hope 2007-07-28 2.jpg|thumb|250px|Iceberg between [[Langø]] and Sanderson Hope, south of [[Upernavik]], Greenland.]]
Other treaties governing all or part of the Arctic region:
*The [[Svalbard Treaty]] of 1920 among initially fourteen countries governs the political and economic status of [[Svalbard]].
*The [[Arctic Cooperation Agreement]] of 1988 between the United States and Canada regulates bilateral cooperation regarding the [[Northwest Passage]], but does not resolve the disagreement between the two countries about the legal status of the passage.
*The [[Arctic Search and Rescue Agreement]] of 2011, concluded by the Arctic Council member states, coordinates [[search and rescue]] in the Arctic.
*The [[Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic]]
*[http://www.regjeringen.no/upload/SMK/Vedlegg/2010/avtale_engelsk.pdf The Barents Sea Border Treaty] specifies the demarcation line between Norway and Russia in the Barents Sea.
*The [[Joint Norwegian–Russian Fisheries Commission]]
*The [[Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears]]

==Territorial Claims==
{{Main|Territorial claims in the Arctic}} 
According to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), coastal states have sovereign rights to resources in the water and seabed within a 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). However, Article 76 of the Convention allows coastal states to extend their sovereign rights up to 350 nautical miles from their coastline if they can prove that the Arctic seafloor’s underwater ridges are an extension of the country’s own [[continental shelf]].&lt;ref name="csis.org"/&gt; Nations have ten years following their ratification of UNCLOS within which to submit their claims to extended continental shelves.

In 2001 Russia was the first Arctic littoral state to submit its claim. The UN Commission on the Continental Shelf requested a revised claim with more scientific data supporting their claim, and Russia planned to file additional data in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chauprade.com/ocean-arctique/russia-on-track-for-new-arctic-bid-in-2013-05-10-10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708140813/http://chauprade.com/ocean-arctique/russia-on-track-for-new-arctic-bid-in-2013-05-10-10 |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }} Russia To File For Extended Continental Shelf in 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Denmark and Canada dispute ownership of [[Hans Island]] in the Nares Strait between Ellesmere Island and Greenland.

On April 27, 2010, Norway and Russia announced an end to their 40-year arctic demarcation dispute in the Barents Sea. Future joint energy development is expected.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[Maritime boundary|Maritime boundaries]] between Canada and the United States in the Beaufort Sea and between Canada and Denmark in Baffin Bay remain under dispute.&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy.com"/&gt;

Denmark (Greenland), Russia and Canada may have competing extended continental shelf claims over the [[Lomonosov Ridge]], an underwater mountain chain crossing the central Arctic basin.&lt;ref name="csis.org"/&gt;

==Shipping &amp; Transport==
Global warming has had a greater impact on summer sea ice in the Arctic than previously estimated. Based on the recent studies, the Arctic will be largely ice-free during the summer sometime between 2020 and 2050. One 2011 Cambridge University study predicted that the Arctic would be free of summer ice by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/grim-new-prediction-arctic-sea-ice-could-disappear-2015] Ice-free Summers in Arctic Ocean by 2015&lt;/ref&gt; No models predict that the winter sea ice will disappear during this century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Arctic+security+considerations+and+the+U.S.+Navy%27s+roadmap+for+the...-a0228993310] Ice-free Summers in Arctic Ocean by 2060&lt;/ref&gt;

An ice-free Arctic has major strategic and economic ramifications for global shipping, as vessels will potentially be able to traverse the Arctic Ocean. Trans-Arctic shipping routes could shorten distances between northern Europe and northern China by up to 4,000 nautical miles and reduce shipping times by up to two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1551">The '''Bavarian Liberation Army''' ({{lang-de|Bajuwarische Befreiungsarmee}}, '''BBA''') is an [[Austria]]n right-wing militant organization.  Its goal is to create a single, Teutonic, ethnically homogenous state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/archive/archive1/austria/index.htm Austria: General Background] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930165217/http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/archive/archive1/austria/index.htm |date=September 30, 2008 }} ''Antisemitism and Xenophobia Today'', 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The BBA claimed responsibility for several letter-bomb attacks in 1995, which killed one German ([[Munich]]) and two Hungarian women ([[Linz]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/12/world/austrian-mail-bomb-alert.html Austrian Mail-Bomb Alert] ''The New York Times'' 12 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Franz Fuchs]], a self-declared BBA operator, was found guilty on 10 March 2001 of 29 different bombings and committed suicide in jail.  Fuchs' attacks, primarily [[letter bomb]]s, targeted minorities and refugees, as well as Austrian and German advocates for those populations.  Fuchs' worst attack killed four [[Romani people|Romani]] in [[Oberwart]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/658668.stm Racist bomber found hanged] ''BBC News'', 27 February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bougafer 33''''' is a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] 2010 documentary film.

== Synopsis ==
Taking the [[exploration|expedition]] of a group of Frenchmen following in the tracks of their fellow countrymen as a starting point, ''Bougafer 33'' is a journey through time and space that tells of the battle that took place in 1933 at the foot of the [[Bougafer Mountain]] during the war [[Morocco]] fought against the [[French-Spanish]] colonial conquest. Eyewitness accounts, stock footage, written tales and songs all contribute to reinstate the history of the last [[resistants]] of the [[Ait Atta]]. An epic ordeal of fierce and highly organized battles in which women and children took part in the name of freedom.

'''City of Ely Council''' is the [[Parish councils in England|parish council]] responsible for local government within the [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] of the city of [[Ely, Cambridgeshire]].

The parish council was formed on 1 April 1974 as a [[successor parish|successor authority]] of the City of Ely Urban District Council. The parish council derives its powers and functions from the Local Government Act 1972 and subsequent legislation.

The civil parish of Ely is divided into four wards called Ely North, Ely South, Ely East and Ely West for the purpose of electing the fourteen councillors to the parish council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cityofelycouncil.org.uk/page/1rwtb/Councillors.html | title= Councillors }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a [[precepting authority]], with tax collected on its behalf by [[East Cambridgeshire District Council]].

'''''Consten SaRL and Grundig GmbH v Commission''''' (1966) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61964CJ0056 Case 56/64] is an [[EU competition law]] case, concerning vertical anti-competitive agreements.

==The Treaty provisions== 

* Art 101(1): The following shall be prohibited as incompatible with the common market: all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market.

* Art 101(3): Any agreements or decisions prohibited pursuant to this section shall be automatically void.

* Art 101(3): ''This subsection gives a list of derogations (or exceptions)''.&lt;ref&gt;The relevant articles were originally numbered 85 &amp; 86, then 81 &amp; 82, and finally 101 &amp; 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
[[Grundig AG|Grundig GmbH]] contracted to distribute its electronic goods in France, appointing appointed Consten SaRL as its exclusive distributor. Grundig guaranteed that no other wholesaler would be allowed to distribute in France, and that, for the purposes of the distribution of Grundig products, Consten was given sole authorisation to use the Grundig name and emblems which are registered in Germany and in other [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]] 

A third-party company, UNEF, bought Grundig products in Germany and began distributing "[[grey import]]s" into France, whereupon Consten and Grundig sought to prevent UNEF from doing so, claiming, ''inter alia'', that UNEF was abusing Grundig's copyright in its own trade name and logos.

The Commission viewed Consten's and Grundig's action against UNEF as an unlawful breach of Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome (now Art 101 of the [[TFEU]]), as it was important to ensure that competing parallel imports from one state to another were unhindered. The case was referred for a [[Preliminary ruling|Preliminary Ruling]] to the [[European Court of Justice]] under Article 177.

==Judgment==
Agreeing with the Commission, the ECJ held that the agreement was unlawful. It rejected the argument that allowing exclusive distributorships protected a distributor’s legitimate interest, by hypothetically preventing competitors (once the costs for initial market penetration had been spent) from free riding on the investment of advertising and marketing initially by the distributor, and then undercutting prices.

{{Cquote|8. [...] An agreement between producer and distributor which might tend to restore the national divisions in trade between Member States might be such as to frustrate the most fundamental objectives of the Community. The Treaty, whose preamble and content aim at abolishing the barriers between States, and which in several provisions gives evidence of a stern attitude with regard to their reappearance, could not allow undertakings to reconstruct such barriers.}}

'''"Corde della mia chitarra"''' (Strings of my guitar) was the [[Italy|Italian]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1957]], performed in [[Italian language|Italian]] by [[Nunzio Gallo]].

With lyrics by Giuseppe Fiorelli and music by [[Mario Ruccione]], including live guitar accompaniment provided by [[Piero Gozo]], it is the longest song in the contest's history. Writer John Kennedy O'Connor describes it as "over five minutes long" in his work on the Contest, and Des Mangan records it as "5 minutes and 9 seconds", as well as suggesting that the listener "would have thought of many better uses for the strings of his guitar". Following this Contest, the rule governing the length of entries was tightened to require them to be no longer than 3.5 minutes initially and later 3 minutes exactly, with both authors agreeing that the change was due to this entry's length. In the 2007 edition of John Kennedy O'Connor's ''The Eurovision Song Contest - The Official History'', the song is officially listed as the longest entry in the history of the contest, and was performed after the officially listed shortest song.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, John Kennedy - The Official History Of The Eurovision Song Contest. Carlton Books, UK, 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-84442-994-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song itself is a ballad in the ''[[chanson]]'' style popular in the early years of the Contest. Gallo sings of his mixed feelings at seeing a former lover and realising that she is no longer interested in him. He asks the strings of his guitar to play for him alone, since she has no interest in their music anymore.

The song was performed fourth on the night, following the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Patricia Bredin]] with "[[All (song)|All]]" and preceding [[Austria]]'s [[Bob Martin (singer)|Bob Martin]] with "[[Wohin, kleines Pony?]]". At the close of voting, it had received 7 points, placing it 6th in a field of 10.

It was succeeded as [[Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest|Italian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1958|1958 Contest]] by [[Domenico Modugno]] with "[[Volare (song)|Nel blu dipinto di blu]]".

The '''Culture of Kosovo''' refers to the culture of [[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}} and mostly of the [[Albanians]] and [[Serbs]]. It encompasses the [[Cultural Heritage of Kosovo|ancient heritage]], [[Architecture of Kosovo|architecture]], [[Literature of Kosovo|literature]], visual arts, [[Music of Kosovo|music]], [[Cinema of Kosovo|cinema]], [[Sport in Kosovo|sport]]s and [[Kosovan cuisine|cuisine]] of Kosovo. Because of its [[History of Kosovo|history]] and [[Geography of Kosovo|geography]], it represents a blend of different [[cultural sphere]]s especially of the western and eastern culture. 

The [[society]] of Kosovo has undergone considerable changes over the last centuries, one of the most notable being the increasing level of [[secularity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom of Thought 2014 report (map)|url=http://freethoughtreport.com/map/|publisher=Freedom of Thought}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national identity revolves more around the language and culture, than the religion.&lt;ref&gt;Judah, Tim. "Albanians." Kosovo: What Everyone Needs to Know. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The country also possess one of the most diverse cultural treasures in its region.

Some 571 recorded artefacts were taken in by Serbia in 1998, and another 677 archeological artefacts in 1999. The artifacts were never returned following the 2008  self-delcared independence of Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/blog/serbia-must-return-kosovo-s-cultural-treasures-12-19-2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DirecTV-14''' is a communication satellite launched on December 6, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arianespace.com/news-press-release/2011/9-13-2011-directv.asp Arianespace to launch up to four satellites for DirecTV]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first satellite offering [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra-HD]] 4K television services using Reverse DBS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arianespace.com/news-press-release/2014/12-6-2014-VA221-success-launch.asp Arianespace VA221 launches satellites for the United States and India]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The DirecTV-14 satellite is the sixth satellite built by SSL (Space Systems/Loral) for operator DirecTV. The high-capacity spacecraft is based on the SSL 1300 platform, DirecTV-14 is a 20-kilowatt class Ka-band and reverse-band digital broadcast satellite that will be used to deliver Ultra HD and other new consumer services for DirecTV.

DirecTV delivers hundreds of channels of digital programming to more than 31 million customers in the U.S. and Latin America with small-diameter dish antennas. This satellite provides service for users across the U.S. (including Hawaii and Alaska) and Puerto Rico. The satellite had a liftoff mass of approximately 6,300 kg. DirecTV-14 is expected to operate for 15 years, or until 2029.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/commercial/arianespace-ready-for-final-ariane-5-flight-of-2014-with-directv-14-and-gsat-16/&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael White, chairman, president and CEO of DirecTV, was skeptical of the prospects for 4K in the past but was determined to stay on the bleeding edge of broadcast technologies. The 6,300 kg DirecTV 14 satellite uses Ka-band and Reverse Band Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) spectrum. DBS is expected to provide ample room for delivering 4K programs and other advanced services to customers.

In March 2015, DirecTV became the first multi-channel video provider to offer 4K Ultra HD programming direct to customers, offering a variety of new releases, popular films and nature documentaries with nearly four times the resolution of HD. Customers who have DirecTV's Genie HD DVR are able to watch 4K programming on supporting 2014 Samsung UHD TVs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/4k-ultra-hd-gets-a-lift-with-successful-directv-satellite-launch-2014-12-06&lt;/ref&gt;

DirecTV-14 also bolstered DirecTV's HD broadcasts. With the new satellite, the company now has a fleet of six HD satellites. Located at 99 degrees west, DirecTV-14 uses spot beams to provide additional local HD content. The 20-kilowatt satellite was expected to enter service early Q2 2016. The next satellite, DirecTV-15, launched May 27, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.satellitetoday.com/regional/2014/12/08/arianespace-launch-boosts-directv-on-4k-isro-on-domestic-capacity/&lt;/ref&gt;

An eldership may comprise  a very small [[region]] consisting of few [[village]]s, one single [[town]], or a part of a big [[city]]. Elderships vary in size and population depending on their location and nature. A few elderships make up a [[municipality]]. [[Šilainiai]] (Kaunas) and [[Dainava (Kaunas)]] are the most populous elderates, with population counts over {{formatnum:70000}}, exceeding the population of some entire municipalities.

Elderships manage small-scale local matters, such as repairing pavements and dirt roads, and keep records on all families living in the eldership. The premise of the concept is that - unlike in higher administrative divisions - an [[Elder (administrative title)|elder]] (the [[leader]] of the eldership) could have time to talk to every person in the eldership who wants to.

Modern Lithuania is divided into [[Counties of Lithuania |10 counties]], [[List of municipalities of Lithuania |60 municipalities]], and 546 elderships. Elderships function as municipal districts. In cities, an elder is elected{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} to each eldership district, along with a mayor for the city.

[[File:Which Major City in Lithuania are any of the Lithuanian Elderships closest to.gif|thumb|Lithuanian Elderships by closest Major City|300px]]

Note: historically{{when?|date=October 2018}} the term referred to significantly larger administrative units, e.g. [[Eldership of Samogitia]] (also known for a longer period of history as the Duchy of Samogitia).{{Citation needed |date= June 2008}}

'''Engineers Without Borders''' (EWB) is a [[Cameroon]]ian [[non-profit organization]] founded in 14 October 2003 in [[Yaounde]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|language=français|title=ISF Cameroun:éditeur multiforme|url=http://spore.cta.int/fr/bookreviews/article/isf-cameroun-editeur-multiforme.html|work=Spore|date=|access-date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cameroon]]. As a development-based association, [[Engineers Without Borders]] - Cameroon works to promote human development by sharing and giving access to relevant scientific and technological knowledge, implementing engineering projects with respect for the [[Natural environment|environment]], economic and social adaptation, and developing [[social partnership|partnership]] and [[synergy]] within the engineering domain.

It is a member of the network [[Engineers Without Borders International]].

== History ==

The group was created in 2003. It is supported by numerous members of academia.{{Citation needed|reason=Previous citation did not provide information on this|date=November 2016}} EWB Cameroon works on knowledge management, [[local development]], [[natural resources]] management, and information and communication for development.

* In 2005, EWB Cameroon organised a campaign on [[entrepreneurship]] for young people in rural areas&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|language=|title=Campagne sur l'entreprenariat des jeunes ruraux du Cameroun|url=http://www.panapress.com/Campagne-sur-l-entreprenariat-des-jeunes-ruraux-du-Cameroun--13-735966-17-lang4-index.html|work=Panapresse|date=|access-date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led the mobilization of Cameroonian [[youth]] for the World Summit in Information Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|language=|title=Engagement de la jeunesse pour le SMSI|url=http://www.tigweb.org/youth-media/panorama/article.html?ContentID=6569&amp;print=true|work=TIG|date=|access-date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2011, the group began producing articles and organising training sessions and technical assistance missions.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  
* In 2015, they launched a national [[competition|contest]] of excellency « graines d’ingénierie ».&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; That year, the group partnered with "Ingénieurs sans frontières [[France]]" to study the « evolution of agricultural engineers skills from counselling to follow-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|language=|title=L'Accompagnement, une posture citoyenne de l'ingénieur|url=https://www.isf-france.org/L_accompagnement_une_posture_citoyenne_de_l_ingenieur|work=ISF France|date=|access-date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* EWB-DC completed trip to Cameroon during March of 2016. This was the fourth implementation trip for the team. One of the trip's main objectives was to continue the pipeline installation from a water catchment area to the location of a future storage tank. After three days of manual labor, approximately 360 meters of pipeline were successfully installed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1636">The '''Erebus Chalice''' is a silver and gilt chalice gifted to the [[National Science Foundation]] in 1987 for use in the [[Chapel of the Snows]] at [[McMurdo Station]] in [[Antarctica]], where it is now kept on display during austral summers. At the time of its gifting, the Chalice was believed to have been carried aboard (and thus named after) {{HMS|Erebus|1826|6}}, one of the two ships of the [[Ross Expedition]]—the other was {{HMS|Terror|1813|6}}—that mapped Antarctica in 1839–1843.&lt;ref name="Johnson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Johnson|title=Big Dead Place: Inside the Strange and Menacing World of Antarctica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIdaA9AUQeIC&amp;pg=PA311|date=April 2011|publisher=ReadHowYouWant.com|isbn=978-1-4596-1749-0|pages=311–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.odt.co.nz/regions/queenstown-lakes/pace-life-increasing-mcmurdo|title=Pace of life increasing at McMurdo|date=14 October 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the [[Canterbury Museum, Christchurch]] discovered that the chalice actually had been made in London circa 1910 and therefore could not have sailed aboard ''Erebus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/erebus-chalice-antarctica/552107/|title=One of Antarctica's Most Celebrated Relics Isn't What It Seems|first=Fortunato|last=Salazar|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current drivers==
'''[[Charles Leclerc (racing driver)|Charles Leclerc]]''' made his Formula One debut for [[Sauber]] at the [[2018 Australian Grand Prix]].

==Former drivers==
'''[[Louis Chiron]]''' was [[Monaco]]'s first [[Formula One]] driver. He is better known for his pre-war efforts in [[motorsport]], having won 21 Grands Prix (including the [[1931 Monaco Grand Prix]]) before the World Championship began in [[1950 Formula One season|1950]]. He was an elder statesman, as he was 50 when the [[1950 British Grand Prix|first World Championship Grand Prix]] came around. His only points finish was a 3rd at his home race in [[1950 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco in 1950]]. He did the full [[1951 Formula One season|1951 season]] bar the [[1951 Indianapolis 500|Indy 500]] and only made sporadic appearances after that. He is still the oldest person to enter a Grand Prix, being 58 years and 288 days old when he failed to qualify for his final race, the [[1958 Monaco Grand Prix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Spurgeon| first =Brad| title =Measuring Experience in Youthful Formula One| newspaper =The New York Times| publisher =The New York Times Company| date =22 August 2009| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/sports/autoracing/23prix.html?_r=0| access-date =21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[André Testut]]''' entered in his [[Monaco Grand Prix|home race]] on 2 occasions – 1958 and [[1959 Monaco Grand Prix|1959]]. Both times he failed to qualify his privateer [[Maserati 250F]].

45 years after Testut failed to make the grid in 1959, '''[[Olivier Beretta]]''' was signed by [[Larrousse]] for the [[1994 Formula One season|1994 season]]. He competed in 10 Grands Prix with a best result of 7th at the [[1994 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]] before his sponsorship money ran out and was replaced with [[Philippe Alliot]]. He finished 8th in his only attempt at his [[1994 Monaco Grand Prix|home race]]. He later switched his focus to sports-cars.

Dutch-born '''[[Robert Doornbos]]''' competed under a Monegasque license due to FIA license regulation in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fia.com:80/sport/Championships/F1/F1_Season_Guide/2005.html |title=FIA Formula One World Championship Season Guide 2005 |publisher=FIA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060408103555/http://www.fia.com/sport/Championships/F1/F1_Season_Guide/2005.html |archivedate=8 April 2006 |accessdate=26 August 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt; before representing the [[Netherlands]] in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4035">'''Franco and Afro Musica''' is a twelve piece [[Gabane]]an [[Kwassa kwassa|kwasa kwasa]] [[music ensemble|band]] founded by [[Frank "Franco" Lesokwane]]. As is the norm in the [[soukous]] (Congolese rumba) circles for artists to go by more than one names, Lesokwane also goes by a plethora of names like Stango, [[Molamu]], [[Lepako]] and [[Chakala]]. After playing and providing vocals for other leading [[Kwasa kwasa]] bands in [[Botswana]], [[Frank Lesokwane|Franco]], together with [[Tanzania]]n born lead guitarist, [[Shabani Mwanasande Yohana]], formed the band and started touring the country. They recruited other soukous experts and recorded their first album, ''[[Ke lela le lona]]'', which loosely translates to "I am crying with you". Other members of [[Afro Musica]] are DannyBass Dikole Gasebatho (bass guitar), Oxy Oxygen Ntoko (Drum), Samurai Ngingo (lead guitar){{cn|date=October 2017}}

After ''[[Ke lela le lona]]'' the band has produced albums annually. The band released their most popular single ''[[Tshutshumakgala]]'' (a [[Tswana language|tswana]] name for a train), which won them their first [[Botswana Music Union]] (BOMU) Award.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2FTu4T6Zgk&lt;/ref&gt; This is a song about how much they fear the train. The songs are usually about controversial issues in the society like witchcraft, promiscuity and death. They tend to write material that is very personal and in each album, the band has at least one song that tells a story about a certain village in Botswana, which has earned them a good following. The band has won several awards, including the BOMU "Best Kwasa Kwasa Album of the Year" two years in a row.

However, in his first ever music video for his new album "[[Mmamane Robala]]", Lesokwane, does not feature his back-up band or dancers, especially in interviews and behind the scene footage and he is unapologetic about it. "I gave them publicity on my [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] and CDs, what more do people want. I have written about those guys on my album sleeves. " I do not think it was so important to feature them in the video," said Franco, when asked why the band did not receive the same exposure he gave himself in the video. "We did not see it necessary to do so. People will talk as they always do, but it is up to the management to decide these things. Maybe Afro Musica will appear in the next video.

In April 2005, the band supported [[Koffi Olomide]] in his African tour. [[Koffi]] was quoted as saying - ''I am shocked to learn that the standards of the rhumba music in the country are this high.''

'''Galaxy 19''' is a [[communications satellite]] owned by [[Intelsat]] located at [[97th meridian west|97° West]] [[longitude]], serving the [[North America]]n market.  Galaxy 19 replaced [[Galaxy 25]] which is nearing the end of its design life and has been moved to 93.1°W [[longitude]].  It was built by [[Space Systems/Loral]], as part of its [[1300 series platform|FS-1300]] line.  Galaxy 19 was formerly known as '''Intelsat Americas 9''' and was successfully launched September 24, 2008.&lt;ref name="Two Rockets Launched"/&gt;  It provides services in the [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] and [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]].

The clients for Galaxy 19 include the previous clients for [[Galaxy 25]].  Expanded services include higher-powered C-band and K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band transponders as well as new, high-power [[Ka band|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; band]] service. As of August 2017, Galaxy 19 broadcast 172 Free-To-Air channels for North American televisions, from a diverse list of national and international sources. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftalist.com/galaxy19.php|title=FTAList.com - Galaxy 19 (97.0 W) channels|author=|date=|website=www.ftalist.com|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grand Casemates''' is a building in [[Grand Casemates Square]], Gibraltar, that was originally a fortified barracks and [[casemate]].
It is beside [[Grand Casemates Gates]], which leads through the former town wall.

==History==
Construction of the Grand Casemates bombproof barracks began in the 1770s under Colonel [[William Green (general)|William Green]], Gibraltar's Chief Engineer, but the building was only completed in 1817 during the governorship of General Sir [[George Don (British Army officer)|George Don]].{{sfn|Casemate Square - GTG}}{{sfn|Finlayson|Fa|2006|p=31}}

Hygiene was initially primitive. In 1865 there was an outbreak of [[cholera]] in the barracks, with several soldiers dying.{{sfn|Great Britain. House of Commons|1875|p=50ff}} In 1868 ablutions and bath rooms had recently been fitted up in the barracks, [[George Jennings|Jenning]]'s fitments (flush toilets) had been installed in the soldier's latrines and the drainage system overhauled.{{sfn|Army medical department|1870|p=53}} However, as of 1874 none of the barracks in Gibraltar had baths, and Grand Casemates was the only one with footpans that could be used to hold water for the men to wash themselves.{{sfn|Great Britain. House of Commons|1874|p=60}} In 1888 it was found that, due to faulty drains, sewage had been soaking into the ground near the soldiers rooms. It was thought that this was the cause of the high incidence of fever in the barracks.{{sfn|Great Britain. House of Commons|1876|p=50}}

For a period, the barracks were home to about two thousand workers from Morocco.{{sfn|Facaros|Pauls|2008|p=230}} More recently, Grand Casemates has been restored and converted for commercial use with restaurants and shops.{{sfn|Finlayson|Fa|2006|p=54}} The building today houses an arts and crafts exhibition hall on the second floor.{{sfn|Gibraltar - Main Sights}}

'''Hereroland''' was a [[bantustan]] in [[South West Africa]] (present day [[Namibia]]), intended by the apartheid government to be a [[self-government|self-governing]] homeland for the [[Herero people]]. It was set up in 1968 and self-government was granted two years later.

Hereroland, like other homelands in South West Africa, was abolished in May 1989 at the start of the [[Namibian War of Independence|transition to independence]].

The '''history of Asia''' can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions such as, [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], and the [[Middle East]] linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian [[steppe]].

The coastal periphery was the home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, with each of the three regions developing early civilizations around fertile river valleys. These valleys were fertile because the soil there was rich and could bear many root crops. The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], [[India]], and [[China]] shared many similarities and likely exchanged technologies and ideas such as [[mathematics]] and the [[wheel]]. Other notions such as that of writing likely developed individually in each area. Cities, states and then empires developed in these lowlands.

The steppe region had long been inhabited by mounted nomads, and from the central steppes they could reach all areas of the Asian continent. The northern part of the continent, covering much of [[Siberia]] was also inaccessible to the steppe nomads due to the dense forests and the [[tundra]].  These areas in Siberia were very sparsely populated.

The centre and periphery were kept separate by mountains and deserts.  The [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], [[Himalayas|Himalaya]], [[Karakum Desert]], and [[Gobi Desert]] formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could only cross with difficulty.  While technologically and culturally the city dwellers were more advanced, they could do little militarily to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe.  However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force.  Thus the nomads who conquered states in the Middle East were soon forced to adapt to the local societies.

Asia's history would feature major developments seen in other parts of the world, as well as events that would affect those other regions. These include the trade of the [[Silk Road]], which spread cultures, languages, religion, and disease throughout Afro-Eurasian trade. Another major advancement was the innovation of [[gunpowder]] in medieval China, which led to advanced warfare through the use of [[gun]]s.

The [[prehistoric Beifudi site]] near Yixian in [[Hebei]] Province, China,  contains relics of a culture contemporaneous with the [[Cishan culture|Cishan]] and [[Xinglongwa culture|Xinglongwa]] cultures of about 8000–7000 BCE, neolithic cultures east of the [[Taihang Mountains]],  filling in an archaeological gap between the two Northern Chinese cultures. The total excavated area is more than 1,200 square meters and  the collection of neolithic findings at the site consists of two phases.&lt;ref name="archdis"&gt;{{cite web

Around 5500 BCE the [[Tel Halaf|Halafian]] culture appeared in [[Lebanon]], [[Land of Israel|Israel]], [[Syria]], [[Anatolia]], and northern [[Mesopotamia]], based upon dryland agriculture.

In southern Mesopotamia were the alluvial plains of [[Sumer]] and [[Elam]]. Since there was little rainfall, [[irrigation]] systems were necessary. The [[Ubaid period|Ubaid]] culture flourished from 5500 BCE.

==Ancient==
===Bronze Age===
{{Main|Ancient Near East|Synoptic table of the principal old world prehistoric cultures}}
The [[Chalcolithic]] period (or Copper Age) began about 4500 BCE, then the [[Bronze Age]] began about 3500 BCE, replacing the Neolithic cultures.

The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (IVC) was a Bronze Age civilization (3300–1300 BCE; mature period 2600–1900 BCE) which was centered mostly in the western part of the Indian Subcontinent; it is considered that an early form of Hinduism was performed during this civilization. Some of the great cities of this civilization include [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-daro]], which had a high level of town planning and arts. The cause of the destruction of these regions around 1700 BCE is debatable, although evidence suggests it was caused by natural disasters (especially flooding).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Indus Valley Civilisation|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/11372/data/history.htm|work=ThinkQuest|accessdate=9 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509014129/http://library.thinkquest.org/11372/data/history.htm|archivedate=9 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This era marks [[Vedic period]] in India, which lasted from roughly 1500 to 500 BCE. During this period, the [[Sanskrit]] language developed and the [[Vedas]] were written, epic hymns that told tales of gods and wars. This was the basis for the Vedic religion, which would eventually sophisticate and develop into [[Hinduism]].{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=68}}

China and [[Vietnam]] were also centres of metalworking. Dating back to the Neolithic Age, the first bronze drums, called the Dong Son drums have been uncovered in and around the Red River Delta regions of Vietnam and Southern China. These relate to the prehistoric Dong Son Culture of Vietnam.

In Ban Chiang, Thailand (Southeast Asia), bronze artifacts have been discovered dating to 2100 BCE.

In Nyaunggan, Burma bronze tools have been excavated along with ceramics and stone artifacts. Dating is still currently broad (3500–500 BCE).

===Iron Age===
{{Main|Iron Age}}
{{Further|Axial Age}}

The Iron Age saw the widespread use of iron tools, weaponry, and armor throughout the major civilizations of Asia.

====Middle East====
The [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid dynasty]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], founded by [[Cyrus the Great]], ruled an area from [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] to the [[Indus River]] and Central Asia during the 6th to 4th centuries BCE. Persian politics included a tolerance for other cultures, a highly [[centralized government]], and significant infrastructure developments. Later, in [[Darius I|Darius the Great]]'s rule, the territories were integrated, a bureaucracy was developed, nobility were assigned military positions, tax collection was carefully organized, and spies were used to ensure the loyalty of regional officials. The primary religion of Persia at this time was [[Zoroastrianism]], developed by the philosopher [[Zoroaster]]. It introduced an early form of [[monotheism]] to the area. The religion banned animal sacrifice and the use of intoxicants in rituals; and introduced the concept of spiritual salvation through personal moral action, an [[end time]], and both [[General judgment|general]] and [[Particular judgment]] with a [[heaven]] or [[hell]]. These concepts would heavily influence later emperors and the masses. More importantly, Zoroastrianism would be an important precursor for the [[Abrahamic religions]] such as Christianity, Islam, or Judaism. The Persian Empire was successful in establishing peace and stability throughout the Middle East and were a major influence in art, politics (affecting Hellenistic leaders), and religion.

[[Alexander the Great]] conquered this dynasty in the 4th century BCE, creating the brief [[Hellenistic period]]. He was unable to establish stability and after his death, Persia broke into small, weak dynasties including the [[Seleucid Empire]], followed by the [[Parthian Empire]]. By the end of the Classical age, Persia had been reconsolidated into the [[Sassanid Empire]], also known as the second Persian Empire.

The [[Roman Empire]] would later control parts of Western Asia. The [[Seleucid]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid]] dynasties of Persia dominated Western Asia for centuries.

====India====
The Maurya and Gupta empires are called the Golden Age of India and were marked by extensive inventions and discoveries in science, technology, art, religion, and philosophy that crystallized the elements of what is generally known as Indian culture. The religions of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], which began in Indian sub-continent, were an important influence on South, East and Southeast Asia.

By 600 BCE, India had been divided into 17 regional states that would occasionally feud amongst themselves. In 327 BCE, [[Alexander the Great]] came to India with a vision of conquering the whole world. He crossed northwestern India and created the province [[Bactria]] but could not move further because his army wanted to go back to their family. Shortly prior, the soldier [[Chandragupta Maurya]] began to take control of the Ganges river and soon established the [[Maurya Empire]]. The Maurya Empire (Sanskrit: मौर्य राजवंश, Maurya Rājavanśha) was the geographically extensive and powerful empire in ancient India, ruled by the Mauryan dynasty from 321 to 185 BCE. It was one of the world's largest empires in its time, stretching to the [[Himalayas]] in the north, what is now [[Assam]] in the east, probably beyond modern [[Pakistan]] in the west, and annexing [[Balochistan]] and much of what is now [[Afghanistan]], at its greatest extent. South of Mauryan empire was the [[Tamilakam]] an independent country dominated by three dynasties, the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandyans]], [[Cholas]] and [[Cheras]]. The government established by Chandragupta was led by an autocratic king, who primarily relied on the military to assert his power.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=65}} It also applied the use of a bureaucracy and even sponsored a postal service.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=65}} Chandragupta's grandson, [[Ashoka]], greatly extended the empire by conquering most of modern-day India (save for the southern tip). He eventually converted to Buddhism, though, and began a peaceful life where he promoted the religion as well as humane methods throughout India. The Maurya Empire would disintegrate soon after Ashoka's death and was conquered by the Kushan invaders from the northwest, establishing the [[Kushan Empire]]. Their conversion to Buddhism caused the religion to be associated with foreigners and therefore a decline in its popularity occurred.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=65}}

The Kushan Empire would fall apart by 220 CE, creating more political turmoil in India. Then in 320, the [[Gupta Empire]] (Sanskrit: गुप्त राजवंश, Gupta Rājavanśha) was established and covered much of the Indian Subcontinent. Founded by [[Maharaja Sri-Gupta]], the dynasty was the model of a classical civilization. Gupta kings united the area primarily through negotiation of local leaders and families as well as strategical intermarriage.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=66}} Their rule covered less land than the Maurya Empire, but established the greatest stability.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=66}} In 535, the empire ended when India was overrun by the [[Huns]].

====Classical China====

=====Zhou Dynasty=====
{{main|Zhou Dynasty}}
Since 1029 BCE, the [[Zhou Dynasty]] ({{zh|c=周朝|p=Zhōu Cháo|w=Chou Ch'ao}} {{IPA-cmn|tʂóʊ tʂʰɑ̌ʊ|}}), had existed in China and it would continue to until 258 BCE.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} The Zhou dynasty had been using a [[Feudalism|feudal system]] by giving power to local nobility and relying on their loyalty in order to control its large territory.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} As a result, the Chinese government at this time tended to be very decentralized and weak, and there was often little the emperor could do to resolve national issues. Nonetheless, the government was able to retain its position with the creation of the [[Mandate of Heaven]], which could establish an emperor as divinely chosen to rule. The Zhou additionally discouraged the [[human sacrifice]] of the preceding eras and unified the [[Chinese language]]. Finally, the Zhou government encouraged settlers to move into the [[Yangtze River]] valley, thus creating the Chinese Middle Kingdom.

But by 500 BCE, its political stability began to decline due to repeated nomadic incursions{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} and internal conflict derived from the fighting princes and families. This was lessened by the many philosophical movements, starting with the life of [[Confucius]]. His philosophical writings (called [[Confucianism]]) concerning the respect of elders and of the state would later be popularly used in the Han Dynasty. Additionally, [[Laozi]]'s concepts of [[Taoism]], including [[yin and yang]] and the innate duality and balance of nature and the universe, became popular throughout this period. Nevertheless, the Zhou Dynasty eventually disintegrated as the local nobles began to gain more power and their conflict devolved into the [[Warring States period]], from 402 to 201 BCE.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=44}}

=====Qin Dynasty=====
{{main|Qin Dynasty}}
One leader eventually came on top, [[Qin Shi Huang]] ({{zh|c=始皇帝}}, ''Shǐ Huángdì''), who overthrew the last Zhou emperor and established the Qin dynasty.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} The [[Qin Dynasty]] (Chinese: 秦朝; pinyin: Qín Cháo) was the first ruling dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 207 BCE.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=42}} The new Emperor abolished the feudal system and directly appointed a bureaucracy that would rely on him for power. Huang's imperial forces crushed any regional resistance, and they furthered the Chinese empire by expanding down to the [[South China Sea]] and northern [[Vietnam]]. Greater organization brought a uniform tax system, a national census, regulated road building (and cart width), standard measurements, standard coinage, and an official written and spoken language.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=45}} Further reforms included new irrigation projects, the encouragement of [[silk]] manufacturing,{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=45}} and (most famously) the beginning of the construction of the Great Wall of China—designed to keep out the nomadic raiders who'd constantly badger the Chinese people. However, Shi Huang was infamous for his tyranny, forcing laborers to build the Wall, ordering heavy taxes, and severely punishing all who opposed him. He oppressed Confucians and promoted [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], the idea that people were inherently evil, and that a strong, forceful government was needed to control them. Legalism was infused with realistic, logical views and rejected the pleasures of educated conversation as frivolous. All of this made Shi Huang extremely unpopular with the people. As the Qin began to weaken, various factions began to fight for control of China.

=====Han Dynasty=====
{{main|Han Dynasty}}
[[File:SeidenstrasseGMT.JPG|300px|thumb|The [[Silk Road]] in Asia]]
The [[Han Dynasty]] (simplified Chinese: 汉朝; traditional Chinese: 漢朝; pinyin: Hàn Cháo ;206 BCE – 220 CE) was the second imperial dynasty of China, preceded by the Qin Dynasty and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms (220–265 CE). Spanning over four centuries, the period of the Han Dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history. One of the Han Dynasty's greatest emperors, [[Emperor Wu of Han]], established a peace throughout China comparable to the [[Pax Romana]] seen in the Mediterranean a hundred years later.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=45}} To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the "Han people". The Han Dynasty was established when two peasants succeeded in rising up against Shi Huang's significantly weaker successor-son. The new Han government retained the centralization and bureaucracy of the Qin, but greatly reduced the repression seen before. They expanded their territory into [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Central Asia]], creating an even larger empire than the Qin.

The Han developed contacts with the Persian Empire in the Middle East and the Romans, through the [[Silk Road]], with which they were able to trade many commodities—primarily silk. Many ancient civilizations were influenced by the [[Silk Road]], which connected China, [[India]], the Middle East and Europe. Han emperors like Wu also promoted Confucianism as the national "religion" (although it is debated by theologians as to whether it is defined as such or as a philosophy). Shrines devoted to Confucius were built and Confucian philosophy was taught to all scholars who entered the Chinese bureaucracy. The bureaucracy was further improved with the introduction of an examination system that selected scholars of high merit. These bureaucrats were often upper-class people educated in special schools, but whose power was often checked by the lower-class brought into the bureaucracy through their skill. The Chinese imperial bureaucracy was very effective and highly respected by all in the realm and would last over 2,000 years. The Han government was highly organized and it commanded the military, judicial law (which used a system of courts and strict laws), agricultural production, the economy, and the general lives of its people. The government also promoted intellectual philosophy, scientific research, and detailed historical records.

However, despite all of this impressive stability, central power began to lose control by the turn of the [[Common Era]]. As the Han Dynasty declined, many factors continued to pummel it into submission until China was left in a state of chaos. By 100 CE, philosophical activity slowed, and corruption ran rampant in the bureaucracy. Local landlords began to take control as the scholars neglected their duties, and this resulted in heavy taxation of the peasantry. Taoists began to gain significant ground and protested the decline. They started to proclaim magical powers and promised to save China with them; the Taoist [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] in 184 (led by rebels in yellow scarves) failed but was able to weaken the government. The aforementioned Huns combined with diseases killed up to half of the population and officially ended the Han Dynasty by 220. The ensuing period of chaos was so terrible it lasted for three centuries, where many weak regional rulers and dynasties failed to establish order in China. This period of chaos and attempts at order is commonly known as that of the [[Six Dynasties]]. The first part of this included the [[Three Kingdoms]] which  started in 220 and describes the brief and weak successor "dynasties" that followed the Han. In 265, the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] of China was started and this soon split into two different empires in control of northwestern and southeastern China. In 420, the conquest and abdication of those two dynasties resulted in the first of the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]]. The Northern and Southern Dynasties passed through until finally, by 557, the [[Northern Zhou Dynasty]] ruled the north and the [[Chen Dynasty]] ruled the south.

==Medieval{{anchor|Medieval}}==
During this period, the [[Eastern world]] empires continued to expand through trade, migration and conquests of neighboring areas. Gunpowder was widely used as early as the 11th century and they were using moveable type printing five hundred years before Gutenberg created his press. Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism were the dominant philosophies of the Far East during the Middle Ages. Marco Polo was not the first Westerner to travel to the Orient and return with amazing stories of this different culture, but his accounts published in the late 13th and early 14th centuries were the first to be widely read throughout Europe.

===Western Asia (Middle East)===
{{main|Medieval Middle East}}

The Arabian peninsula and the surrounding [[Middle East]] and [[Near East]] regions saw dramatic change during the Medieval era caused primarily by the spread of [[Islam]] and the establishment of the Arabian Empires.

In the 5th century, the Middle East was separated into small, weak states; the two most prominent were the [[Sasanian Empire]] of the [[History of Iran|Persian]]s in what is now [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], and the Byzantine Empire in [[Anatolia]] (modern-day [[Turkey]]). The Byzantines and Sasanians fought with each other continually, a reflection of the rivalry between the Roman Empire and the Persian Empire seen during the previous five hundred years. The fighting weakened both states, leaving the stage open to a new power. Meanwhile, the nomadic [[Bedouin]] tribes who dominated the Arabian desert saw a period of tribal stability, greater trade networking and a familiarity with Abrahamic religions or monotheism.

While the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Roman and [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanid]] Persian empires were both weakened by the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]], a new power in the form of [[Islam]] grew in the Middle East under [[Muhammad in Medina]]. In a series of rapid [[Muslim conquests]], the [[Rashidun army]], led by the [[Caliph]]s and skilled military commanders such as [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], swept through most of the Middle East, taking more than half of Byzantine territory in the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]] and completely engulfing Persia in the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. It would be the Arab [[Caliphate]]s of the [[Middle Ages]] that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant [[Arab|ethnic identity]] that persists today. These Caliphates included the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], [[Umayyad Caliphate]], [[Abbasid Caliphate]], and later the [[Seljuq Empire]].

After Muhammad introduced Islam, it jump-started Middle Eastern culture into an [[Islamic Golden Age]], inspiring achievements in [[architecture]], the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life. Muslims saved and spread Greek advances in [[History of medicine|medicine]], [[History of elementary algebra|algebra]], [[History of geometry|geometry]], [[History of astronomy|astronomy]], [[History of anatomy|anatomy]], and [[History of ethics|ethics]] that would later finds it way back to Western Europe.

The dominance of the Arabs came to a sudden end in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the [[Seljuq Turks]], migrating south from the Turkic homelands in Central Asia. They conquered Persia, Iraq (capturing Baghdad in 1055), Syria, Palestine, and the [[Hejaz]]. This was followed by a series of Christian Western Europe invasions. The fragmentation of the Middle East allowed joined forces, mainly from England, France, and the emerging [[Holy Roman Empire]], to enter the region. In 1099 the knights of the [[First Crusade]] captured [[Jerusalem]] and founded the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], which survived until 1187, when [[Saladin]] retook the city. Smaller crusader fiefdoms survived until 1291. In the early 13th century, a new wave of invaders, the armies of the [[Mongol Empire]], swept through the region, sacking Baghdad in the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)]] and advancing as far south as the border of [[Egypt]] in what became known as the [[Mongol conquests]]. The Mongols eventually retreated in 1335, but the chaos that ensued throughout the empire deposed the Seljuq Turks. In 1401, the region was further plagued by the Turko-Mongol, [[Timur]], and his ferocious raids. By then, another group of Turks had arisen as well, the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]].

===Central Asia===
{{main|Medieval Central Asia}}

====Mongol Empire====
The [[Mongol Empire]] conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Medieval Asia was the kingdom of the Khans. Never before had any person controlled as much land as [[Genghis Khan]]. He built his power unifying separate Mongol tribes before expanding his kingdom south and west. He and his grandson, Kublai Khan, controlled lands in China, Burma, Central Asia, Russia, Iran, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Estimates are that the Mongol armies reduced the population of China by nearly a third. Genghis Khan was a pagan who tolerated nearly every religion, and their culture often suffered the harshest treatment from Mongol armies. The Khan armies pushed as far west as Jerusalem before being defeated in 1260.

===South Asia===
====India====
{{main|Medieval India}}
[[File:Buddhist Expansion.svg|thumb|right|320px|Buddhist adoption in Asia, Mahayana Buddhism first entered China through [[Silk Road]].]]

The Indian early medieval age, 600 to 1200, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity. When [[Harsha]] of [[Kannauj]], who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]] ruler of the Deccan. When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] king of [[Bengal]]. When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the [[Pallava]]s from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the [[Pandyas]] and the [[Cholas]] from still farther south. The Cholas could under the rule of [[Raja Raja Chola]] defeat their rivals and rise to a regional power. Cholas expanded northward and defeated [[Eastern Chalukya]], [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Kalinga]] and the [[Pala Empire|Pala]]. Under [[Rajendra Chola]] the Cholas created the first notable navy of Indian subcontinent. The [[Chola navy]] extended the influence of Chola empire to [[southeast asia]]. During this time, pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Stein|first=B.|author-link=Burton Stein|date=16 June 1998|title=A History of India|edition=1st|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|place=Oxford|isbn=978-0-631-20546-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SXdVS0SzQSAC|pages=119–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent]] mainly took place from the 12th century onwards, though earlier Muslim conquests made limited inroads into the region, beginning during the period of the ascendancy of the [[Rajput]] Kingdoms in North India, although [[Sindh]] and Multan were captured in 8th century.

===East Asia===
{{main|History of East Asia}}

====China====
{{main|Medieval China}}
China saw the rise and fall of the Sui, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties and therefore improvements in its bureaucracy, the spread of [[Buddhism]], and the advent of [[Neo-Confucianism]]. It was an unsurpassed era for Chinese ceramics and painting. Medieval architectural masterpieces the Great South Gate in Todaiji, Japan, and the Tien-ning Temple in Peking, China are some of the surviving constructs from this era.

=====Sui Dynasty=====
{{main|Sui Dynasty}}
A new powerful dynasty began to rise in the 580s, amongst the divided factions of China. This was started when an aristocrat named Yang Jian married his daughter into the Northern Zhou Dynasty. He proclaimed himself [[Emperor Wen of Sui]] and appeased the nomadic military by abandoning the Confucian scholar-gentry. Emperor Wen soon led the conquest of the southern Chen Dynasty and united China once more under the [[Sui Dynasty]]. The emperor lowered taxes and constructed granaries that he used to prevent famine and control the market. Later Wen's son would murder him for the throne and declare himself [[Emperor Yang of Sui]]. Emperor Yang revived the Confucian scholars and the bureaucracy, much to anger of the aristocrats and nomadic military leaders. Yang became an excessive leader who overused China's resources for personal luxury and perpetuated exhaustive attempts to reconquer Korea. His military failures and neglect of the empire forced his own ministers to assassinate him in 618, ending the Sui Dynasty.

=====Tang dynasty=====
{{main|Tang dynasty}}
[[File:Battle of Talas.png|thumb|380px|[[Battle of Talas]] between Tang dynasty and [[Abbasid Caliphate]] c. 751]]

Fortunately, one of Yang's most respectable advisors, Li Yuan, was able to claim the throne quickly, preventing a chaotic collapse. He proclaimed himself [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Emperor Gaozu]], and established the [[Tang dynasty]] in 623. The Tang saw expansion of China through conquest to Tibet in the west, [[Vietnam]] in the south, and Manchuria in the north. Tang emperors also improved the education of scholars in the Chinese bureaucracy. A Ministry of Rites was established and the examination system was improved to better qualify scholars for their jobs.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=270|loc=Chapter 12|quote=In the Tang and Song periods, the examination system was greatly expanded, and the pattern of advancement in the civil service was much more regularized. This meant that in the political realm more than any previous political system (and those yet to come for centuries), the Chinese connected merit as measured by tested skills with authority and status.}} In addition, Buddhism became popular in China with two different strains between the peasantry and the elite, the [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] and [[Zen]] strains, respectively.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|pages=271–272|loc=Chapter 12|quote=Among the masses, the salvationist pure land strain of Mahayana Buddhism won widespread conversions because it seemed to provide a refuge from an age of war and turmoil. Members of the elite class, on the other hand, were more attracted to the Chan variant of Buddhism, or Zen as it is known in Japan and the West.}} Greatly supporting the spread of Buddhism was [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]], who additionally claimed an unofficial "Zhou Dynasty" and displayed China's tolerance of a woman ruler, which was rare at the time. However, Buddhism would also experience some backlash, especially from Confucianists and Taoists. This would usually involve criticism about how it was costing the state money, since the government was unable to tax Buddhist monasteries, and additionally sent many grants and gifts to them.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=273|loc=Chapter 12|quote=Because monastic lands and resources were not taxed, the Tang regime lost huge amounts of revenue as a result of imperial grants or the gifts of wealthy families to Buddhist monasteries.}}

The Tang dynasty began to decline under the rule of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]], who began to neglect the economy and military and caused unrest amongst the court officials due to the excessive influence of his concubine, [[Yang Guifei]], and her family.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=274|loc=Chapter 12|quote=The arrogance and excessive ambition of Yang Guifei and her family angered members of the rival cliques at court, who took every opportunity to turn Yang's excesses into a cause for popular unreast.}} This eventually sparked a revolt in 755.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=274|loc=Chapter 12|quote=The deepening crisis came to a head in 755 when one of [Xuanzong]'s main military leaders&amp;nbsp;... led a widely supported revolt with the aim of founding a new dynasty to supplant the Tang.}} Although the revolt failed, subduing it required involvement with the unruly nomadic tribes outside of China and distributing more power to local leaders—leaving the government and economy in a degraded state. The Tang dynasty officially ended in 907 and various factions led by the aforementioned nomadic tribes and local leaders would fight for control of China in the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]].

=====Liao, Song and Jin dynasties=====
{{main|Liao dynasty|Song dynasty|Jin dynasty (1115–1234)}}
By 960, most of China proper had been reunited under the [[Song dynasty]], although it lost territories in the north and could not defeat one of the nomadic tribes there—the [[Liao dynasty]] of the highly sinicized [[Khitan people]]. From then on, the Song would have to pay tribute to avoid invasion and thus set the precedent for other nomadic kingdoms to oppress them. The Song also saw the revival of Confucianism in the form of [[Neo-Confucianism]]. This had the effect of putting the Confucian scholars at a higher status than aristocrats or Buddhists and also intensified the reduction of power in women. The infamous practice of [[foot binding]] developed in this period as a result. Eventually the Liao dynasty in the north was overthrown by the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] of the Manchu-related [[Jurchen people]]. The new Jin kingdom [[Jin–Song Wars|invaded northern China]], leaving the Song to flee farther south and creating the [[Southern Song dynasty]] in 1126. There, cultural life flourished.

=====Yuan Dynasty=====
{{main|Yuan Dynasty}}
 [[File:Route of Marco Polo.png|thumb|380px|Map of Marco Polo's travels]]
By 1227, the Mongols had conquered the [[Western Xia]] kingdom northwest of China. Soon the Mongols incurred upon the Jin empire of the Jurchens. Chinese cities were soon besieged by the Mongol hordes that showed little mercy for those who resisted and the Southern Song Chinese were quickly losing territory. In 1271 the current great khan, [[Kublai Khan]], claimed himself Emperor of China and officially established the Yuan Dynasty. By 1290, all of China was under control of the Mongols, marking the first time they were ever completely conquered by a foreign invader; the new capital was established at [[Khanbaliq]] (modern-day [[Beijing]]). Kublai Khan segregated Mongol culture from Chinese culture by discouraging interactions between the two peoples, separating living spaces and places of worship, and reserving top administrative positions to Mongols, thus preventing Confucian scholars to continue the bureaucratic system. Nevertheless, Kublai remained fascinated with Chinese thinking, surrounding himself with Chinese Buddhist, Taoist, or Confucian advisors.

Mongol women displayed a contrasting independent nature compared to the Chinese women who continued to be suppressed. Mongol women often rode out on hunts or even to war. Kublai's wife, [[Chabi]], was a perfect example of this; Chabi advised her husband on several political and diplomatic matters; she convinced him that the Chinese were to be respected and well-treated in order to make them easier to rule.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=327|loc=Chapter 14|quote=[Chabi] convinced Kubilai that the harsh treatment of the survivors of the defeated Song imperial family would only anger the peoples of north China and make them more difficult to rule.}} However this was not enough to affect Chinese women's position, and the increasingly Neo-Confucian successors of Kublai further repressed Chinese and even Mongol women.

The Black Death, which would later ravage Western Europe, had its beginnings in Asia, where it wiped out large populations in China in 1331.

====Japan====
{{main|Medieval Japan}}
[[File:Shotoku Taishi.jpg|thumb|left|Sculpture of [[Prince Shōtoku]]]]

=====Asuka period=====
Japan's medieval history began with the [[Asuka period]], from around 600 to 710. The time was characterized by the [[Taika Reform]] and imperial centralization, both of which were a direct result of growing Chinese contact and influences. In 603, [[Prince Shōtoku]] of the [[Imperial House of Japan|Yamato dynasty]] began significant political and cultural changes. He issued the [[Seventeen-article constitution]] in 604, centralizing power towards the emperor (under the title ''tenno'', or heavenly sovereign) and removing the power to levy taxes from provincial lords. Shōtoku was also a patron of Buddhism and he encouraged building temples competitively.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=124–137}}

=====Nara period=====
Shōtoku's reforms transitioned Japan to the [[Nara period]] (c. 710 to c. 794), with the moving of the Japanese capital to [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] in [[Honshu]]. This period saw the culmination of Chinese-style writing, etiquette, and architecture in Japan along with Confucian ideals{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|pages=291–301}} to supplement the already present Buddhism. Peasants revered both Confucian scholars and Buddhist monks. However, Buddhism gained the status of state religion, and the government ordered the construction of Buddhist temples, monasteries, and statues.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=124–137}} The lavish spending combined with the fact that many aristocrats did not pay taxes, put a heavy burden on peasantry that caused poverty and famine.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=124–137}} Eventually the Buddhist position got out of control, threatening to seize imperial power and causing [[Emperor Kanmu]] to move the capital to [[Heian-kyō]] to avoid a Buddhist takeover.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|pages=291–301}} This marked the beginning of the [[Heian period]] and the end of Taika reform.

=====Heian period=====
With the Heian period (from 794 to 1185) came a decline of imperial power. Chinese influence also declined, as a result of its correlation with imperial centralization and the [[Mandate of Heaven|heavenly mandate]], which came to be regarded as ineffective. By 838, the Japanese court discontinued its embassies in China; only traders and Buddhist monks continued to travel to China. Buddhism itself came to be considered more Japanese than Chinese, and persisted to be popular in Japan. Buddhists monks and monasteries continued their attempts to gather personal power in courts, along with aristocrats. One particular noble family that dominated influence in the imperial bureaucracy was the [[Fujiwara clan]]. During this time cultural life in the imperial court flourished. There was a focus on beauty and social interaction and writing and literature was considered refined. Noblewomen were cultured the same as noblemen, dabbling in creative works and politics. A prime example of both Japanese literature and women's role in high-class culture at this time was ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', written by the [[lady-in-waiting]] [[Murasaki Shikibu]]. Popularization of wooden palaces and [[shōji]] sliding doors amongst the nobility also occurred.

Loss of imperial power also led to the rise of provincial warrior elites. Small lords began to function independently. They administered laws, supervised public works projects, and collected revenue for themselves instead of the imperial court. Regional lords also began to build their own armies. These warriors were loyal only their local lords and not the emperor, although the imperial government increasingly called them in to protect the capital. The regional warrior class developed into the [[samurai]], which created its own culture: including specialized weapons such as the [[katana]] and a form of chivalry, [[bushido]]. The imperial government's loss of control in the second half of the Heian period allowed banditry to grow, requiring both feudal lords and Buddhist monasteries to procure warriors for protection. As imperial control over Japan declined, feudal lords also became more independent and seceded from the empire. These feudal states squandered the peasants living in them, reducing the farmers to an almost [[serfdom]] status. Peasants were also rigidly restricted from rising to the samurai class, being physically set off by dress and weapon restrictions. As a result of their oppression, many peasants turned to Buddhism as a hope for reward in the afterlife for upright behavior.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|pages=296}}

With the increase of feudalism, families in the imperial court began to depend on alliances with regional lords. The Fujiwara clan declined from power, replaced by a rivalry between the [[Taira clan]] and the [[Minamoto clan]]. This rivalry grew into the [[Genpei War]] in the early 1180s. This war saw the use of both samurai and peasant soldiers. For the samurai, battle was ritual and they often easily cut down the poorly trained peasantry. The Minamoto clan proved successful due to their rural alliances. Once the Taira was destroyed, the Minamoto established a military government called the [[shogunate]] (or bakufu), centered in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]].

=====Kamakura period=====
The end of the Genpei War and the establishment of the [[Kamakura shogunate]] marked the end of the Heian period and the beginning of the [[Kamakura period]] in 1185, solidifying feudal Japan.

====Korea====
{{main|Medieval Korea}}
Korea was fought between the three local kingdoms: [[Silla]], [[Baekje]], and [[Goguryeo]]. This continued until the Silla allied with Tang China to conquer all of Korea. Attempts at sinicization occurred.

===Southeast Asia===

==Early modern==
{{further|Early modern period}}
[[File:Modern Asia (1796).tif|thumb|245px|A 1796 map of Asia (or the "[[Eastern world]]"), which also included the continent of [[Australia]] (then known as [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]) within its realm.]]
The [[Russian Empire]] began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of [[Siberia]] and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The [[Ottoman Empire]] controlled Anatolia, the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] conquered China and established the [[Qing Dynasty]]. In the 16th century, the [[Mughal Empire]] controlled much of India and initiated the second golden age for India. China was the largest economy in the world for much of the time, followed by India until the 18th century.

===Ming China===

By 1368, [[Zhu Yuanzhang]] had claimed himself [[Hongwu Emperor]] and established the Ming Dynasty of China. Immediately, the new emperor and his followers drove the Mongols and their culture out of China and beyond the Great Wall.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=503|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Immediately after he seized the throne, Zhu launched an effort to rid China of all traces of the "barbarian" Mongols. Mongol dress was discarded, Mongol names were dropped by those who had adopted them and were removed from buildings and court records, and Mongol palaces and administrative buildings in some areas were raided and sacked. The nomads themselves fled or were driven beyond the Great Wall, where military expeditions pursued them on several occasions.}} The new emperor was somewhat suspicious of the scholars that dominated China's bureaucracy, for he had been born a peasant and was uneducated.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=503|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Because the Hongwu emperor, like the founder of the earlier Han dynasty, was from a peasant family and thus poorly educated, he viewed the scholar-gentry with some suspicion.}} Nevertheless, Confucian scholars were necessary to China's bureaucracy and were reestablished as well as reforms that would improve the exam systems and make them more important in entering the bureaucracy than ever before. The exams became more rigorous, cut down harshly on cheating, and those who excelled were more highly appraised. Finally, Hongwu also directed more power towards the role of emperor so as to end the corrupt influences of the bureaucrats.

====Society and economy====
The Hongwu emperor, perhaps for his sympathy of the common-folk, had built many irrigation systems and other public projects that provided help for the peasant farmers.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=504|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Perhaps because his lowly origins and personal suffering made him sensitive to the plight of the peasantry, Hongwu introduced measures that would improve the lot of the common people. Like most strong emperors, he promoted public works projects, including dike building and the extension of irrigation systems aimed at improving the farmers' yields.}} They were also allowed to cultivate and claim unoccupied land without having to pay any taxes and labor demands were lowered.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=504|loc=Chapter 22|quote=... Hongwu decreed that unoccupied lands would become the tax-exempt property of those who cleared and cultivated them. He lowered forced labor demands on the peasantry by both the government and members of the gentry class.}} However, none of this was able to stop the rising landlord class that gained many privileges from the government and slowly gained control of the peasantry. Moneylenders foreclosed on peasant debt in exchange for mortgages and bought up farmer land, forcing them to become the landlords' tenants or to wander elsewhere for work.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=505|loc=Chapter 22}} Also during this time, [[Neo-Confucianism]] intensified even more than the previous two dynasties (the Song and Yuan). Focus on the superiority of elders over youth, men over women, and teachers over students resulted in minor discrimination of the "inferior" classes. The fine arts grew in the Ming era, with improved techniques in brush painting that depicted scenes of court, city or country life; people such as scholars or travelers; or the beauty of mountains, lakes, or marshes. The Chinese novel fully developed in this era, with such classics written such as ''[[Water Margin]]'', ''[[Journey to the West]]'', and ''[[Jin Ping Mei]]''.

Economics grew rapidly in the Ming Dynasty as well. The introduction of American crops such as [[maize]], [[sweet potatoes]], and [[peanut]]s allowed for cultivation of crops in infertile land and helped prevent famine. The population boom that began in the Song dynasty accelerated until China's population went from 80 or 90 million to 150 million in three centuries, culminating in 1600.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=507|loc=Chapter 22|quote=By 1600 the population of China had risen to as many as 150 million from 80 to 90 million in the 14th century.}} This paralleled the market economy that was growing both internally and externally. Silk, tea, ceramics, and lacquer-ware were produced by artisans that traded them in Asia and to Europeans. Westerners began to trade (with some Chinese-assigned limits), primarily in the port-towns of [[Macau]] and [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. Although merchants benefited greatly from this, land remained the primary symbol of wealth in China and traders' riches were often put into acquiring more land.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=507|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Much of the merchants' wealth was invested in land rather than plowed back into trade or manufacturing, because land owning, not commerce, remained the surest route to social status in China.}} Therefore, little of these riches were used in private enterprises that could've allowed for China to develop the [[market economy]] that often accompanied the highly-successful Western countries.

====Foreign interests====
[[File:Fort St. George, Chennai.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the [[Fort St George]] in 18th-century [[Madras]].]]
In the interest of national glory, the Chinese began sending impressive [[Junk (ship)|junk]] ships across the [[South China Sea]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. From 1403 to 1433, the [[Yongle Emperor]] commissioned [[Treasure voyages|expeditions]] led by the admiral [[Zheng He]], a Muslim [[eunuch]] from China. Chinese junks carrying hundreds of soldiers, goods, and animals for zoos, traveled to Southeast Asia, Persia, southern Arabia, and east Africa to show off Chinese power. Their prowess exceeded that of current Europeans at the time, and had these expeditions not ended, the world economy may be different from today.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=339|loc=Chapter 15|quote=There is no question that the course of world history might have been changed dramatically had the Chinese thrust continued, for the tiny European expeditions that began to creep down the western coast of Africa at about the same time would have been no match for this combination of merchant and military organization.}} In 1433, the Chinese government decided that the cost of a navy was an unnecessary expense. The Chinese navy was slowly dismantled and focus on interior reform and military defense began. It was China's longstanding priority that they protect themselves from nomads and they have accordingly returned to it. The growing limits on the Chinese navy would leave them vulnerable to foreign invasion by sea later on.

[[File:Schall-von-bell.jpg|thumb|Here a Jesuit, Adam Schall von Bell (1592–1666), is dressed as an official of the Chinese Department of Astronomy.]]

As was inevitable, Westerners arrived on the Chinese east coast, primarily [[Jesuit]] missionaries which reached the mainland in 1582. They attempted to [[Jesuit China missions|convert the Chinese people to Christianity]] by first converting the top of the social hierarchy and allowing the lower classes to subsequently convert. To further gain support, many Jesuits adopted Chinese dress, customs, and language.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=508|loc=Chapter 22|quote=The Jesuits believed that the best way to convert a great civilization such as China was to adopt the dress, customs, language and manners of its elite.}} Some Chinese scholars were interested in certain Western teachings and especially in Western technology. By the 1580s, Jesuit scholars like [[Matteo Ricci]] and [[Adam Schall]] amazed the Chinese elite with technological advances such as European clocks, improved calendars and cannons, and the accurate prediction of eclipses.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=508|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Beginning in the 1580s, a succession of brilliant Jesuit scholars ... spent most of their time in the imperial city, correcting faulty calendars, forging cannons, fixing clocks imported from Europe, and astounding the Chinese scholar-gentry with the accuracy of their instruments and their ability to predict eclipses.}} Although some the scholar-gentry converted, many were suspicious of the Westerners whom they called "barbarians" and even resented them for the embarrassment they received at the hand of Western correction. Nevertheless, a small group of Jesuit scholars remained at the court to impress the emperor and his advisors.

====Decline====
[[Image:Batavia, C. de Jonghe (1740).jpg|thumb|left|Dutch Batavia in the 17th century, built in what is now [[North Jakarta]]]]

Near the end of the 1500s, the extremely centralized government that gave so much power to the emperor had begun to fail as more incompetent rulers took the mantle. Along with these weak rulers came increasingly corrupt officials who took advantage of the decline. Once more the public projects fell into disrepair due to neglect by the bureaucracy and resulted in floods, drought, and famine that rocked the peasantry. The famine soon became so terrible that some peasants resorted to selling their children to slavery to save them from starvation, or to eating bark, the feces of geese, or [[Cannibalism|other people]].{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=509|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Peasants in afflicted districts were reduced to eating the bark from trees or the excrement of wild geese. Some peasants sold their children into slavery to keep them from starving, and peasants in some areas resorted to cannibalism.}} Many landlords abused the situation by building large estates where desperate farmers would work and be exploited. In turn, many of these farmers resorted to flight, banditry, and open rebellion.

All of this corresponded with the usual dynastic decline of China seen before, as well as the growing foreign threats. In the mid-16th century, Japanese and ethnic Chinese pirates began to raid the southern coast, and neither the bureaucracy nor the military were able to stop them.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=510|loc=Chapter 22|quote=One of the early signs of the seriousness of imperial deterioration was the inability of Chinese bureaucrats and military forces to put an end to the epidemic of Japanese (and ethnic Chinese) pirate attacks that ravaged the southern coast in the mid-16th century.}} The threat of the northern [[Manchu people]] also grew. The Manchu were an already large state north of China, when in the early 17th century a local leader named [[Nurhaci]] suddenly united them under the [[Eight Banners]]—armies that the opposing families were organized into. The Manchus adopted many Chinese customs, specifically taking after their bureaucracy. Nevertheless, the Manchus still remained a Chinese [[vassal]]. In 1644 Chinese administration became so weak, the 16th and last emperor, the [[Chongzhen Emperor]], did not respond to the severity of an ensuing rebellion by local dissenters until the enemy had invaded the [[Forbidden City]] (his personal estate). He soon hanged himself in the imperial gardens.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=510|loc=Chapter 22|quote=By [1644], the administrative apparatus had become so feeble that the last Ming emperor, Chongzhen, did not realize how serious the rebel advance was until enemy soldiers were scaling the walls of the forbidden city. ... the ill-fated Chongzhen retreated to the imperial gardens and hanged himself rather than face capture.}} For a brief amount of time, the [[Shun Dynasty]] was claimed, until a loyalist Ming official called support from the Manchus to put down the new dynasty. The Shun Dynasty ended within a year and the Manchu were now within the Great Wall. Taking advantage of the situation, the Manchus marched on the Chinese capital of Beijing. [[Manchu conquest of China|Within two decades]] all of China belonged to the Manchu and the [[Qing Dynasty]] was established.

==Late modern==
{{further|Modern history#Late modern period}}

===Qing China===
{{Main|Qing Dynasty}}

By 1644, the northern [[Manchu people]] had conquered China and established a foreign dynasty—the [[Qing Dynasty]]—once more. The Manchu Qing emperors, especially Confucian scholar [[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi]], remained largely conservative—retaining the bureaucracy and the scholars within it, as well as the Confucian ideals present in Chinese society. However, changes in the economy and new attempts at resolving certain issues occurred too. These included increased trade with Western countries that brought large amounts of silver into the Chinese economy in exchange for tea, [[porcelain]], and silk textiles. This allowed for a new merchant-class, the [[comprador]]s, to develop. In addition, repairs were done on existing [[Levee|dikes]], canals, roadways, and [[irrigation]] works. This, combined with the lowering of taxes and government-assigned labor, was supposed to calm peasant unrest. However, the Qing failed to control the growing landlord class which had begun to exploit the peasantry and abuse their position.

By the late 18th century, both internal and external issues began to arise in Qing China's politics, society, and economy. The exam system with which scholars were assigned into the bureaucracy became increasingly corrupt; bribes and other forms of cheating allowed for inexperienced and inept scholars to enter the bureaucracy and this eventually caused rampant neglect of the peasantry, military, and the previously mentioned infrastructure projects. Poverty and banditry steadily rose, especially in rural areas, and mass migrations looking for work throughout China occurred. The perpetually conservative government refused to make reforms that could resolve these issues.

====Opium War====
{{Main|First Opium War}}

China saw its status reduced by what it perceived as parasitic trade with Westerners. Originally, European traders were at a disadvantage because the Chinese cared little for their goods, while European demand for Chinese commodities such as tea and porcelain only grew. In order to tip the trade imbalance in their favor, British merchants began to sell Indian [[opium]] to the Chinese. Not only did this sap Chinese bullion reserves, it also led to widespread drug addiction amongst the [[scholar official|bureaucracy]] and society in general. A ban was placed on opium as early as 1729 by the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], but little was done to enforce it. By the early 19th century, under the new [[Daoguang Emperor]], the government began serious efforts to eradicate opium from Chinese society. Leading this endeavour were respected scholar-officials including [[Imperial Commissioner (China)|Imperial Commissioner]] [[Lin Zexu]].

After Lin [[Destruction of opium at Humen|destroyed more than 20,000 chests of opium]] in the summer of 1839, Europeans demanded compensation for what they saw as unwarranted Chinese interference in their affairs. When it was not paid, the British declared war later the same year, starting what became known as the [[First Opium War]]. The outdated Chinese [[Junk (ship)|junks]] were no match for the advanced British gunboats, and soon the [[Yangzi River]] region came under threat of British bombardment and invasion. The emperor had no choice but to sue for peace, resulting in the exile of Lin and the making of the [[Treaty of Nanking]], which ceded the British control of [[Hong Kong]] and opened up trade and diplomacy with other European countries, including Germany, France, and the USA.

==Contemporary==
{{further|Contemporary history}}
[[File:Asia (late 19th century- early 20th century).jpg|thumb|380px|left|Map of Asia for early 20th century]]

The European powers had control of other parts of Asia by the early 20th century, such as [[British Raj|British India]], [[French Indochina]], [[Spanish East Indies]], and Portuguese [[Macau]] and [[Goa]]. The [[Great Game]] between Russia and Britain was the struggle for power in the Central Asian region in the nineteenth century. The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], crossing Asia by train, was complete by 1916. Parts of Asia remained free from European control, although not influence, such as [[Persia]], [[Thailand]] and most of China. In the twentieth century, [[Imperial Japan]] expanded into China and Southeast Asia during the [[Second World War]]. After the war, many Asian countries became independent from European powers. During the [[Cold War]], the northern parts of Asia were communist controlled with the [[Soviet Union]] and People's Republic of China, while western allies formed pacts such as [[CENTO]] and [[SEATO]]. Conflicts such as the [[Korean War]], [[Vietnam War]] and [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] were fought between communists and anti-communists. In the decades after the Second World War, a massive restructuring plan drove Japan to become the world's second-largest economy, a phenomenon known as the [[Japanese post-war economic miracle]]. The [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] has dominated much of the recent history of the Middle East. After the [[Soviet Union]]'s collapse in 1991, there were many new independent nations in Central Asia.

===China===
{{main|History of the Republic of China|History of the People's Republic of China}}
Prior to [[World War II]], China faced a civil war between [[Mao Zedong]]'s Communist party and [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalist party; the nationalists appeared to be in the lead. However, once the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invaded]] in 1937, the two parties were forced to form a temporary cease-fire in order to defend China. The nationalists faced many military failures that caused them to lose territory and subsequently, respect from the Chinese masses. In contrast, the communists' use of guerilla warfare (led by [[Lin Biao]]) proved effective against the Japanese's conventional methods and put the Communist Party on top by 1945. They also gained popularity for the reforms they were already applying in controlled areas, including land redistribution, education reforms, and widespread health care. For the next four years, the nationalists would be forced to retreat to the small island east of China, known as [[Taiwan]] (formerly known as Formosa), where they remain today. In mainland China, the [[People's Republic of China]] was established by the Communist Party, with [[Mao Zedong]] as its [[President of the People's Republic of China|state chairman]].

The communist government in China was defined by the party [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]]. These hard-line officers controlled the [[People's Liberation Army]], which itself controlled large amounts of the bureaucracy. This system was further controlled by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], which additionally supported the state chairman who was considered the head of the government. The People's Republic's foreign policies included the repressing of [[secession]] attempts in Mongolia and Tibet and supporting of [[North Korea]] and [[North Vietnam]] in the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]], respectively. Additionally, by 1960 China began to cut off its connections with the Soviet Union due to border disputes and an increasing Chinese sense of superiority, especially the personal feeling of Mao over the Russian premier, [[Nikita Khrushchev]].

Today China, India, South Korea, Japan and [[Russia]] play important roles in world economics and politics. China today is the world's second largest economy and the second fastest growing economy. Indian economy is the seventh-largest in the world by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity and is the fastest growing economy.

[[File:Ancient kingdoms of Cyprus en.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map showing the ten ancient city-kingdoms of Cyprus]]

'''Kition''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Κίτιον}}, ''Kítion''; {{lang-xpu|𐤊‬𐤕‬}}, {{sc|kt}},{{sfnp|Huss|1985|p=[https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=NvEK7kc3qnQC&amp;pg=PA568 568]}} or {{lang|xpu|𐤊‬𐤕𐤉}}, {{sc|kty}}), also known by its [[Latin]] name '''Citium''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Citium|volume=6|page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[petty kingdom|city-kingdom]] on the southern coast of [[Cyprus]] (in present-day [[Larnaca]]). It was established in the 13th century BC.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;According to the text on the plaque closest to the excavation pit of the Kathari site (as of 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Its most famous, and probably only known, resident was [[Zeno of Citium]], born c. 334 BC in Citium and founder of the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] school of philosophy which he taught in Athens from about 300 BC.

==Name==
'''Kathian''' in an Egyptian inscription dating to the period of Pharaoh [[Ramses III]] (1198–1116 BC) found in the temple of [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]] among the names of other Cypriot cities is considered to refer to Kition.&lt;ref name=Guidebook6&gt;{{cite book|last= Flourentzos&lt;!--also spelled Phlourentzos--&gt; |first=Paulos | title= A Guide to the Larnaca District Museum |year=1996 |publisher= Ministry of Communications and Works - Department of Antiquities|isbn=978-9963-36-425-1 |location=Nicosia |oclc=489834719|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josephus]] identifies the town with the name [[Kittim]], used by the Hebrews to designate all of Cyprus and even lands further west.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, Flavius.  [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/josephus/complete.ii.ii.vi.html ''The Antiquities of the Jews'' 1.6.1.]  Translated by William Whiston.

==History==
The city-kingdom was originally established in the 13th century BC.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;According to the text on the plaque closest to the excavation pit at the Kathari site (as of 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mycenaeans]] first settled in the area for the purpose of the exploitation of [[copper]], but the settlement eventually faded two centuries later as a result of constant [[Civil disorder|disarray]] and [[anxiety]] of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference  |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299630204_Andreas_G_Orphanides_The_Mycenaeans_in_Cyprus_Economic_Political_and_Ethnic_Implications_Lines_Between_Culture_and_Empire_in_the_Eastern_Mediterranean_Conference_3-6_June_2015_Nicosia_Cyprus|title=The Mycenaeans in Cyprus: Economic, Political and Ethnic Implications |conference=Lines Between: Culture and Empire in the Eastern Mediterranean Conference, 3-6 June 2015, Nicosia, Cyprus |last=Orphanides|first=Andreas G. |via=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New cultural elements appearing between 1200 BC and 1000 BC (personal objects, pottery, new architectural forms and ideas) are indications of significant political changes after the arrival of the [[Achaeans (tribe)|Achaeans]], the first Greek colonists of Kition.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Excerpt of text on the only plaque at the Kathari site (as of 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Kition, Faience ryhton with enamel inlay, 13th c. BC.jpg|thumb|Faience ryhton with enamel inlay, 13th c. BC, Nicosia museum]]

Early in the 12th century BC the town was rebuilt on a larger scale, its [[mudbrick]] city wall was replaced by a [[cyclopean wall]].&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt of wall mounted text in exhibit room number two at Larnaca District Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1000 BC, the religious part of the city was abandoned, although life seems to have continued in other areas as indicated by finds in tombs.&lt;ref name=Guidebook6 /&gt;

Literary evidence suggests an early Phoenician presence also at Kition which was under [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] rule at the beginning of the 10th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hadjisavvas|first=Sophocles|title=The Phoenician Period Necropolis of Kition, Volume I|year=2013|publisher=Shelby White and Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/wl/publications/2012/hadjisavvas.html|page=1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111945/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/wl/publications/2012/hadjisavvas.html|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Phoenicia]]n [[merchants]] who were believed to come from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] [[colony|colonized]] the area and expanded the political influence of Kition.

[[File:Kition, Zeus Keraunios.jpg|thumb|Zeus Keraunios, 500-480 BC, Nicosia museum]]

The kingdom was under Egyptian domination from 570 to 545 BC.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;According to text on one of the signs at the entrance of the Kathari site.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Persia]] ruled Cyprus from 545 BC.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Kings of the city are referred to by name from 500 BC—in Phoenician texts and as inscriptions on coins.&lt;ref name="Yon 9"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Kition in the Tenth to Fourth Centuries B. C. | journal = Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research | date = Nov 1997 | first = Marguerite | last = Yon |author2=William A. P.  | volume=308 | page=9 | jstor=1357405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marguerite Yon]] claims that literary texts and inscriptions suggest that by the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]] Kition was one of the principal local powers, along with its neighbour [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]].&lt;ref name="Yon 9"/&gt; In 499 BC Cypriot kingdoms (including Kition) joined Ionia's revolt against Persia.&lt;ref name="archaeological1"&gt;According to text mounted in the coin display at [[Larnaca District Archaeological Museum|Larnaca District Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Persian rule of Cyprus ended in 332 BC.

[[Ptolemy I]] conquered Cyprus in 312 BC and killed [[Poumyathon]], the Phoenician king of Kition, and burned the temples.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Shortly afterwards the Cypriot city-kingdoms were dissolved and the Phoenician dynasty of Kition was abolished. Following these events the area lost its religious character.&lt;ref&gt;Text on the plaque (on the grounds of [[Larnaca District Archaeological Museum]]) facing the Bamboula site.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a trading colony from Kition established at [[Piraeus]] had prospered to the point that, in 233 BC they requested and received permission for the construction of a temple dedicated to [[Astarte]]".&lt;ref name=Guidebook15&gt;{{cite book|last= Flourentzos &lt;!--also spelled Phlourentzos--&gt;|first=Paulos | title= A Guide to the Larnaca District Museum |year=1996 |publisher= Ministry of Communications and Works - Department of Antiquities|isbn=978-9963-36-425-1 |location=Nicosia |oclc=489834719|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyprus was annexed by Rome in 58 BC.&lt;ref name=Guidebook /&gt;

Strong&lt;ref name=Guidebook18/&gt;  earthquakes hit the city in 76 AD and the year after, but the city seems to have been prosperous during Roman times. A ''curator civitatis'', or financial administrator of the city, was sent to Kition from Rome during the rule of [[Septimius Severus]].&lt;ref name=Guidebook /&gt;

Earthquakes of 322 and 342 AD "caused the destruction not only of Kition but also of Salamis and Pafos".&lt;ref name=Guidebook18/&gt;

==The Kition archaeological sites==
Kition was first systematically&lt;ref name="Kition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcw.gov.cy/mcw/da/da.nsf/All/7A7351CF22898DFEC22571A4002CA21C?OpenDocument |title=Kition |language=el |publisher=Mcw.gov.cy |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] by the [[Swedish Cyprus Expedition|Swedish Cyprus Archaeological Expedition]] in 1929 (under the direction of [[Einar Gjerstad]]).

Archaeology is continuing near the Kathari site. In 2016 a rare discovery of a magnificent 20m-long Roman mosaic in a baths building was made, showing the labours of Hercules.&lt;ref&gt;http://theartnewspaper.com/news/archeology/ancient-roman-mosaics-uncovered-in-cyprus-/&lt;/ref&gt; It was found under Kyriakou Matsi Street when clearing a sewer and is expected to be transferred to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ekathimerini.com/210444/article/ekathimerini/life/unique-roman-era-mosaic-of-herculess-labors-to-go-to-larnaca-museum&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Kathari site (a.k.a. Area II)===
[[File:Großer Tempel Kition.JPG|thumb|300px|Large Temple, Kition]]
This site is located around 500 metres north of the Bamboula site and sometimes referred to as "Kition Area II".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The Department of Antiquities (under the direction of Vassos Karageorghis) started excavating in 1959&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcw.gov.cy/mcw/da/da.nsf/All/7A7351CF22898DFEC22571A4002CA21C?OpenDocument |title=Department of Antiquities - Kition |language=el |publisher=Mcw.gov.cy |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; continuing until 1981.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Excavations have revealed part of a [[defensive wall]], dating from the 13th century BC&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt of text on the only [[plaquette|plaque]] at the Kathari site (as of 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; and remains of five temples including [[cyclopean wall]]s. The largest temple's (horizontal) dimensions were 35 m by 22 m.&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt of wall mounted text in exhibit room number 2 at Larnaca District Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; and was built using [[ashlar]] blocks. Temple (2) was rebuilt—around 1200 BC.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Temple (1) has [[Late Bronze Age]] [[graffiti]] of ships on the [[façade]] of the south wall.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===The Bamboula site===
[[File:Sargon II relief Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Sargon Stele]]; replica in the [[Larnaca District Archaeological Museum|Larnaca Museum]], original [[Berlin]]]]

The site is located around 50 metres north of the [[Larnaca District Archaeological Museum|Larnaca Museum]].
In 1845 the [[Sargon Stele]] was found here, together with a gilded silver ''plakette'' now in the [[Louvre]].

A British Expedition first excavated the site in 1913.

A French team from the [[University of Lyon]]&lt;ref name="Kition"/&gt; started excavating in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Kition in the Tenth to Fourth Centuries B.

In its final stage, it consisted of ship sheds (six of them have been recorded), 6 metres wide and about 38 to 39 meters long, with shipways on which [[trireme]]s were pulled up to dry under tiled roofs&lt;ref name="archaeological2"/&gt;

===Other archaeological sites at Kition===
Five [[Hypogeum|built tombs—hypogeum is another name for this type of tombs]]—have been discovered at Kition—the Vangelis Tomb, Godham's Tomb, the [[Catacomb of Phaneromeni Church|Phaneromeni-]], and the [[Turabi Tekke Tomb|Turabi Tekke tomb]].&lt;ref name="archaeological3"&gt;Excerpt of wall mounted text at [[Larnaca District Archaeological Museum|Larnaca District Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt; Two important stele with inscriptions in the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] script were found in the Turabi Tekke cemetery in the late nineteenth century. They are now in the [[British Museum]]'s collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=Kition+Stela British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kition Area I'', "close to the west [city] wall of the Pre-Phoenician period, seems to have been a residential area" according to architectural and moveable finds.&lt;ref name=Guidebook&gt;{{cite book|first=Paulos |last=Flourentzos&lt;!--also spelled Phlourentzos--&gt;|title=A Guide to the Larnaca District Museum|year=1996|publisher=Ministry of Communications and Works - Department of Antiquities|isbn=978-9963-36-425-1 |location=Nicosia |oclc=489834719|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Kition Area III" and "-IV" are names of other archaeological sites at Kition.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The "mound gate" in the city wall was located in the vicinity northwest of the [[Catacomb of Phaneromeni Church|Phaneromeni Tomb]].&lt;ref&gt;According to text on a map that is part of one of the signs at the entrance of the Kition-Kathari site.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also an [[acropolis]].&lt;ref&gt;According to display number 2 in exhibit room number 2 at the [[Larnaca District Archaeological Museum|Larnaca District Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Necropolis====
Sophocles Hadjisavvas has said that "the necropolis of Kition is the most extensively investigated burial ground on the island of Cyprus".&lt;ref name="fas.harvard.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/wl/publications/2012/hadjisavvas.html |title=The Phoenician Period Necropolis of Kition, Volume I |work=Fas.harvard.edu |accessdate=2014-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111945/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/wl/publications/2012/hadjisavvas.html |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The [[necropolis]] [of Kition] extends from the Ayios Prodromos and the area of Agios Ioannis "[[Pervolia]]" and "[[Mnemata Site|Mnimata]]" (Northern Necropolis) to [[Agios Georgios Kontou cemetery|Ayios Georghios Kontos]] and the [[Chrysosotiros church]] (Soteros quarter), (Western Necropolis)."&lt;ref name="archaeological3"/&gt; A "part of the '''Kition''' necropolis became the subject of rescue work at the site of Agios Prodromos".&lt;ref name="fas.harvard.edu"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31282">{{Politics of the Holy See}}
The '''multilateral foreign policy of the Holy See''' is particularly active on some issues, such as [[human rights]], [[disarmament]], and [[economic and social development]], which are dealt with in international fora. 

==Right to life==
Both at the United Nations and at the various international conferences, the Holy See has promoted the "[[Culture of life]]", opposing efforts to legalize or endorse [[abortion]] and [[euthanasia]] through [[Treaty|internationally legally binding instruments]] or non-binding declarations, advocating for the abolition of [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] at the global level, and seeking to ban [[Stem cell controversy|research on human embryos]]. At the United Nations General Assembly, the Holy See stated that: 
{{quote|The right to life and respect for human dignity remains an inalienable right of every person and a founding principle of this Organization. It is therefore the duty of States to promote and protect this right from [[Human fertilization|conception]] until [[natural death]]. To that end, we must work consistently to reverse the [[culture of death]] embraced by some social and legal structures which justify certain forms of destruction of life as a legal necessity or a medical service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holyseemission.org/15Nov2007.html Statements of the Holy See on draft resolution A/C.3/62/L.29 “Moratorium on the use of the death penalty”, 62nd session of the UN General Assembly, 15 Nov 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Human cloning===
At the international level, the Holy See has underlined the ethical problems raised by some current forms of [[biomedical research]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2008/january/index_en.htm Benedict XVI, Address to the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See, 7 Jan 2008]: 
{{quote|I cannot but deplore once again the continual attacks perpetrated on every continent against human life. I would like to recall, together with many men and women dedicated to research and science, that the new frontiers reached in bioethics do not require us to choose between science and morality: rather, they oblige us to a moral use of science.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Holy See has been particularly active in the area of [[human cloning]].  In 2001, when [[Germany]] and [[France]] proposed at the United Nations General Assembly the adoption of an [[Human cloning#United Nations|international convention to ban reproductive human cloning]], the Holy See, together with a coalition of like-minded states that included [[Spain]], [[Philippines]], the [[United States]], and [[Costa Rica]], noted that such a convention would implicitly legitimize the cloning of human beings for research purposes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holyseemission.org/cloning2003eng.html Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See to the United Nations, the Views of the Holy See on Human Embryonic Cloning, 17 Jul 2003  para. 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201195347/http://www.holyseemission.org/cloning2003eng.html |date=2008-12-01 }}:
{{quote|The difference between "reproductive" cloning and "research" cloning (so-called "therapeutic" cloning) consists only in the objective of the procedure: in "reproductive" cloning one intends to develop a child by implanting the cloned embryo in a womb. In "research" cloning, one intends to use the cloned embryo in such a way that it is ultimately destroyed.  To ban "reproductive" cloning only, without prohibiting "research" cloning, would  be to allow the production of individual human lives with the intention of destroying these lives as part of the process of using them for scientific research. The early human embryo, not yet implanted into a womb, is nonetheless a human individual, with a human life, and evolving as an autonomous organism toward its full development into a human fetus Destroying this embryo is therefore a grave moral disorder, since it is the  deliberate suppression of a innocent human being.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is more serious from an ethical point of view than the reproductive one,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20081208_dignitas-personae_en.html Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Instruction ''Dignitas Personae'' on certain bioethical questions, 8 Sep 2008], para 30: {{quote|From the ethical point of view, so-called therapeutic cloning is even more serious. To create embryos with the intention of destroying them, even with the intention of helping the sick, is completely incompatible with human dignity, because it makes the existence of a human being at the embryonic stage nothing more than a means to be used and destroyed. It is ''gravely immoral to sacrifice a human life for therapeutic ends''." (italics in the original)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed banning all forms of human cloning.&lt;ref&gt;See generally [https://www.un.org/law/cloning/ UNGA Ad Hoc Committee on an international convention against the reproductive cloning of human beings]&lt;/ref&gt; The Holy See objected to the "production of millions of human embryos with the intention of destroying them as part of the process of using them for scientific research" and to the instrumentalization and victimization of women, specially of the poorest women, in the process of harvesting the necessary [[oocyte|human eggs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holyseemission.org/cloning2003eng.html Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See to the United Nations, the Views of the Holy See on Human Embryonic Cloning, 17 Jul 2003, para.5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201195347/http://www.holyseemission.org/cloning2003eng.html |date=2008-12-01 }}. See also [http://www.holyseemission.org/30sep2003.html Statement of the Permanent Observer of the Holy See on Human Cloning, 30 Sep 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517131527/http://www.holyseemission.org/30sep2003.html |date=2008-05-17 }} and [http://www.holyseemission.org/21oct2004.html Statement of the Permanent Observer of the Holy See on Human Cloning, 21 Oct 2004].&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts lead to the successful adoption, in March 2005, of a [https://web.archive.org/web/20131215040939/http://www.bioeticaweb.com/content/view/1267/765/lang,es/ United Nations Declaration on Human Cloning], which calls upon all member states of the UN "to prohibit all forms of human cloning inasmuch as they are incompatible with human dignity and the protection of human life".

===Death penalty===
In 2007, the Holy See argued at the United Nations that the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] should be used exceptionally, only when its use is necessary to protect society against an aggressor, a situation which is "practically non-existent" today, since societies have other ways of protecting their citizens. In addition, it noted that capital punishment is frequently discriminatory, since it is imposed most often on the poorest and on members of [[Minority group|religious, ethnic and racial minorities]]; and that it is irreversible, since it excludes all possibilities of [[Legal recourse|recourse]] and [[Reparation (legal)|restoration]] in the event of a [[miscarriage of justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holyseemission.org/15Nov2007.html Statements of the Holy See on draft resolution A/C.3/62/L.29 “Moratorium on the use of the death penalty”, 62nd session of the UN General Assembly, 15 Nov 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the Holy See worked for the adoption of a [[UN moratorium on the death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt; At his [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2008/january/index_en.htm Address to the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See of 7 Jan 2008], Pope Benedict XVI said: {{quote|I rejoice that on 18 December last the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a resolution calling upon States to institute a moratorium on the use of the death penalty, and I earnestly hope that this initiative will lead to public debate on the sacred character of human life.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of conscience and religion==

Following [[Vatican Council II]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Vatican Council II]], Declaration of Religious Freedom '[[Dignitatis Humanae]]', 7 December 1965, para. 2:&lt;blockquote&gt;This Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. This freedom means that all men are to be immune from coercion on the part of individuals or of social groups and of any human power, in such wise that no one is to be forced to act in a manner contrary to his own beliefs, whether privately or publicly, whether alone or in association with others, within due limits. The council further declares that the right to religious freedom has its foundation in the very dignity of the human person as this dignity is known through the revealed word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom is to be recognized in the constitutional law whereby society is governed and thus it is to become a civil right.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the Holy See has uphold, at the international level, the centrality of the [[freedom of conscience]] and [[freedom of religion|religion]] among all Human Rights&lt;ref&gt;Benedict XVI, Message for the Celebration of the World Day of Peace: [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/messages/peace/documents/hf_ben-xvi_mes_20101208_xliv-world-day-peace_en.html Religious Freedom, the Path to Peace], 1 Jan 2011, para. 5: "It could be said that among the fundamental rights and freedoms rooted in the dignity of the person, religious freedom enjoys a special status. When religious freedom is acknowledged, the dignity of the human person is respected at its root, and the ethos and institutions of peoples are strengthened. On the other hand, whenever religious freedom is denied, and attempts are made to hinder people from professing their religion or faith and living accordingly, human dignity is offended, with a resulting threat to justice and peace, which are grounded in that right social order established in the light of Supreme Truth and Supreme Goodness."&lt;/ref&gt; since, in its view, those freedoms impinge on essence of the Human person.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict XVI, Message for the Celebration of the World Day of Peace: [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/messages/peace/documents/hf_ben-xvi_mes_20101208_xliv-world-day-peace_en.html Religious Freedom, the Path to Peace], 1 Jan 2011, para. 2: &lt;blockquote&gt;The right to religious freedom is rooted in the very dignity of the human person, whose transcendent nature must not be ignored or overlooked. God created man and woman in his own image and likeness (cf. Gen 1:27). For this reason each person is endowed with the sacred right to a full life, also from a spiritual standpoint. Without the acknowledgement of his spiritual being, without openness to the transcendent, the human person withdraws within himself, fails to find answers to the heart’s deepest questions about life’s meaning, fails to appropriate lasting ethical values and principles, and fails even to experience authentic freedom and to build a just society.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XVI]] noted that "religious freedom expresses what is unique about the human person, for it allows us to direct our personal and social life to God, in whose light the identity, meaning and purpose of the person are fully understood. To deny or arbitrarily restrict this freedom is to foster a reductive vision of the human person; to eclipse the public role of religion is to create a society which is unjust, inasmuch as it fails to take account of the true nature of the human person; it is to stifle the growth of the authentic and lasting peace of the whole human family."&lt;ref&gt;Benedict XVI, Message for the Celebration of the World Day of Peace: [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/messages/peace/documents/hf_ben-xvi_mes_20101208_xliv-world-day-peace_en.html Religious Freedom, the Path to Peace], 1 Jan 2011, para. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the respect for freedom of religion is at the basis of the respect for all other human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict XVI, Message for the Celebration of the World Day of Peace: [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/messages/peace/documents/hf_ben-xvi_mes_20101208_xliv-world-day-peace_en.html Religious Freedom, the Path to Peace], 1 Jan 2011, para. 3:&lt;blockquote&gt;Religious freedom is at the origin of moral freedom. Openness to truth and perfect goodness, openness to God, is rooted in human nature; it confers full dignity on each individual and is the guarantee of full mutual respect between persons. Religious freedom should be understood, then, not merely as immunity from coercion, but even more fundamentally as an ability to order one’s own choices in accordance with truth. Freedom and respect are inseparable; indeed, “in exercising their rights, individuals and social groups are bound by the moral law to have regard for the rights of others, their own duties to others and the common good of all”([[Vatican Council II]], Declaration of Religious Freedom '[[Dignitatis Humanae]]', 7 December 1965, para. 7.).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the Holy See has called upon States to comply with their international commitments to respect those rights. It has stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Recognition of the dignity of each and every person, which the Human Rights Council was formed to protect and promote, entails full respect for the inner and transcendent dimension of the human person, which is an integral part of what it means to be a human being. Through the free exercise of conscience and moral decision making, human beings are able to transform themselves into living members of social life whose good will, charity and hope promote the dignity and wellbeing of every member of the human family. Intrinsically linked to freedom of conscience is the [[freedom of religion]] by which human beings are able to pursue the most important relationship of their life, that is, their relationship with [[God]]. Freedom of religion necessarily entails the freedom to ascribe to a set of beliefs, to adopt or change one’s [[religion]], to profess one’s [[faith]] and to practice fully that faith openly and publicly. Governments have a solemn responsibility to safeguard rather than ridicule this inalienable right. Since the State is not the author of any fundamental human right, it must respect that intimate and fundamental sanctuary of human freedom, the conscience, and to allow each conscience its fullest and highest expression in the free exercise of religious faith.&lt;ref&gt;Archbishop Francis Chullikatt, Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations, 65th session of the United Nations General Assembly, [http://www.holyseemission.org/statements/statement.aspx?id=85 Statement on the Report of the Human Rights Council, New York, 3 November 2010]. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In parallel, the Holy See condemns the violation to the freedom of religion, specially when suffered by Christians: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is painful to think that in some areas of the world it is impossible to profess one’s religion freely except at the risk of life and personal liberty. In other areas we see more subtle and sophisticated forms of prejudice and hostility towards believers and religious symbols. At present, Christians are the religious group which suffers most from persecution on account of its faith. Many Christians experience daily affronts and often live in fear because of their pursuit of truth, their faith in Jesus Christ and their heartfelt plea for respect for religious freedom. This situation is unacceptable, since it represents an insult to God and to human dignity; furthermore, it is a threat to security and peace, and an obstacle to the achievement of authentic and integral human development.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict XVI, Message for the Celebration of the World Day of Peace: [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/messages/peace/documents/hf_ben-xvi_mes_20101208_xliv-world-day-peace_en.html Religious Freedom, the Path to Peace], 1 Jan 2011, para. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this context, the Holy See has stressed the duty of both governments and private individuals "to promote tolerance, mutual understanding and respect among the followers of the various faith traditions."&lt;ref&gt;Archbishop Francis Chullikatt, Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations, 65th session of the United Nations General Assembly, [http://www.holyseemission.org/statements/statement.aspx?id=85 Statement on the Report of the Human Rights Council, New York, 3 November 2010].&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Holy See has condemned religious fanaticism and violence as a prevention of the freedom of religion,&lt;ref&gt;Benedict XVI, Message for the Celebration of the World Day of Peace: [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/messages/peace/documents/hf_ben-xvi_mes_20101208_xliv-world-day-peace_en.html Religious Freedom, the Path to Peace], 1 Jan 2011, para. 7:&lt;blockquote&gt;The exploitation of religious freedom to disguise hidden interests, such as the subversion of the established order, the hoarding of resources or the grip on power of a single group, can cause enormous harm to societies. Fanaticism, fundamentalism and practices contrary to human dignity can never be justified, even less so in the name of religion. The profession of a religion cannot be exploited or imposed by force. States and the various human communities must never forget that religious freedom is the condition for the pursuit of truth, and truth does not impose itself by violence but “by the force of its own truth”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "every form of hostility to religion that would restrict the public role of believers in civil and political life."&lt;ref&gt;Benedict XVI, Message for the Celebration of the World Day of Peace: [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/messages/peace/documents/hf_ben-xvi_mes_20101208_xliv-world-day-peace_en.html Religious Freedom, the Path to Peace], 1 Jan 2011, para. 7:&lt;blockquote&gt;It should be clear that religious fundamentalism and secularism are alike in that both represent extreme forms of a rejection of legitimate pluralism and the principle of secularity. Both absolutize a reductive and partial vision of the human person, favouring in the one case forms of religious integralism and, in the other, of rationalism. A society that would violently impose or, on the contrary, reject religion is not only unjust to individuals and to God, but also to itself. God beckons humanity with a loving plan that, while engaging the whole person in his or her natural and spiritual dimensions, calls for a free and responsible answer which engages the whole heart and being, individual and communitarian. Society too, as an expression of the person and of all his or her constitutive dimensions, must live and organize itself in a way that favours openness to transcendence. Precisely for this reason, the laws and institutions of a society cannot be shaped in such a way as to ignore the religious dimension of its citizens or to prescind completely from it. Through the democratic activity of citizens conscious of their lofty calling, those laws and institutions must adequately reflect the authentic nature of the person and support its religious dimension. Since the latter is not a creation of the state, it cannot be manipulated by the state, but must rather be acknowledged and respected by it. Whenever the legal system at any level, national or international, allows or tolerates religious or antireligious fanaticism, it fails in its mission, which is to protect and promote justice and the rights of all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual and reproductive rights==
Faced with a coordinated effort to incorporate [[Reproductive rights|''sexual and reproductive rights'']] within the body of the [[Human Rights#International norms| international recognized human rights]], &lt;ref&gt;On the coordinated effort see: [http://thomas.loc.gov Center for Reproductive Rights, International Legal Program,  Establishing International Reproductive Rights Norms: Theory for Change, US CONG. REC. 108th CONG. 1 Sess. E2534 E2547 (Rep. Smith) (Dec. 8, 2003)]: 
{{quote|Our goal is to ensure that governments worldwide guarantee women's reproductive rights out of an understanding that they are bound to do so. The two principal prerequisites for achieving this goal are: (1) the strengthening of international legal norms protecting reproductive rights; and (2) consistent and effective action on the part of civil society and the international community to enforce these norms. Each of these conditions, in turn, depends upon profound social change at the local, national and international (including regional) levels. (...) Ultimately, we must persuade governments to accept reproductive rights as binding norms. Again, our approach can move forward on several fronts, with interventions both at the national and international levels. Governments' recognition of reproductive rights norms may be indicated by their support for progressive language in international conference documents or by their adoption and implementation of appropriate national-level legislative and policy instruments. In order to counter opposition to an expansion of recognized reproductive rights norms, we have questioned the credibility of such reactionary yet influential international actors as the United States and the Holy See. Our activities to garner support for international protections of reproductive rights include: Lobbying government delegations at UN conferences and producing supporting analyses/materials;}}

===Traditional family===
At the various international conferences, the Holy See argued that the traditional family, based on a stable and loving relationship between a man and a woman, is necessary for the responsible transmission and nurturing of new life. Consequently, society must recognize the traditional family’s contribution to society’s own good through appropriate cultural, fiscal and social policy. 
At the [[International Conference on Population and Development|1994 Cairo Conference]], the Holy See argued that global population policy should ultimately be guided by the Respect for life and for the dignity of the human person so as to “foster the family based on marriage and must sustain parents, fathers and mothers, in their mutual and responsible decisions with regard to the procreation and education of children.” &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/popin/icpd/conference/gov/940908193315.html Holy See opening statement at the Cairo Conference, 7 Set 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the Holy See has opposed “any attempts to weaken the family or to propose a radical redefining of its structure, such as [[Same-sex marriage|assigning the status of family to other life-style forms]].”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/popin/icpd/conference/gov/940908193315.html Holy See opening statement at the Cairo Conference, 7 Set 1994] This position has been reiterated by Pope Benedict XVI, see, e.g. [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2007/january/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20070108_diplomatic-corps_en.html Benedict XVI, Address to the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See, 8 Jan 2007]: {{quote|there are mounting threats to the natural composition of the family based on the marriage of a man and a woman, and attempts to relativize it by giving it the same status as other radically different forms of union. All this offends and helps to destabilize the family by concealing its specific nature and its unique social role.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual orientation===
In particular, the Holy See has opposed the use of the terms “[[Sexual orientation]]” and “[[Gender identity]]” in international human rights instruments, since, due to the fact that there is no agreed definition of those terms in international law, their use could favor of a redefinition of the family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/2008/documents/rc_seg-st_20081218_statement-sexual-orientation_en.html Declaration of the Holy See on the proposed United Nations Declaration on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, 18 Dec 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In its view, the term [[gender]], whenever used, should be understood as [[male]] and [[female]] as grounded on the biological sexual identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its.caltech.edu/~nmcenter/women-cp/beijing3.html Concluding statement of the Holy See at the Beijing Conference, 15 Set 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; On these bases, in 2008, the Holy See opposed the adoption of a [[UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity|proposed declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity]] by the United Nations General Assembly. At the same time, the Holy See has condemned all forms of violence against [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] persons and has called for the elimination of criminal penalties against them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/2008/documents/rc_seg-st_20081218_statement-sexual-orientation_en.html Declaration of the Holy See on the proposed United Nations Declaration on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, 18 Dec 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responsible sexual behavior===
The Holy See condemned ''irresponsible sexual behavior'', which, in its view, victimizes mostly women and children, and which is fostered by today’s “attitudes of sexual permissiveness, which focus above all on personal pleasure and gratification.” &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/popin/icpd/conference/gov/940908193315.html Holy See opening statement at the Cairo Conference, 7 Set 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; It has further argued that traditional sexual mores are the best way to prevent [[Sexually transmitted disease]]s  including [[AIDS]].  As Archbishop [[Javier Lozano Barragán]], “health minister“ of the Holy See stated at a UN special session on AIDS: 
{{quote|Regarding the sexual transmission of the disease, the best and most effective prevention is training in the authentic values of life, love and sexuality. A proper appreciation of these values will inform today's men and women about how to attain full personal fulfillment through affective maturity and the proper use of sexuality, whereby couples remain faithful to each other and behave in a way that keeps them from becoming infected by HIV/AIDS. No one can deny that sexual license increases the danger of contracting the disease. It is in this context that the values of matrimonial fidelity and of [[chastity]] and [[abstinence]] can be better understood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/aids/statements/docs/holyseeE.html Statement of the Holy See at the XXVI Special Session of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS, 27 June 2001.]&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
In the same vein, during his 2009 trip to Africa, Pope Benedict XVI argued that the spread of AIDS “cannot be overcome by the distribution of prophylactics: on the contrary, they increase it. The solution must have two elements: firstly, bringing out the human dimension of sexuality, that is to say a spiritual and human renewal that would bring with it a new way of behaving towards others, and secondly, true friendship offered above all to those who are suffering, a willingness to make sacrifices and to practise self-denial, to be alongside the suffering."&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2009/march/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20090317_africa-interview_en.html  Benedict XVI, Interview during his fight to Africa, 17 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family planning===
The Holy See underlined that responsible parenthood entails responsibility and demands discipline and self-restrain, &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/popin/icpd/conference/gov/940908193315.html Holy See opening statement at the Cairo Conference, 7 Set 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the area of sexual behavior. The Holy See opposed efforts to endorse [[Family planning]] methods which separate what, in its view, are the two essential dimensions of human sexuality: the transmission of life and the loving care of parents. At the Cairo Conference, the Holy See opposed the term ''family planning services'' which encompass [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]], since it was often abused, especially when promoted among the poor or the illiterate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/popin/icpd/conference/gov/940908193315.html Holy See opening statement at the Cairo Conference, 7 Set 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the [[Fourth World Conference on Women|1995 Beijing Conference on Women]], the Holy See reiterated that use of the term ''widest range of family planning services'' should not be interpreted as endorsing family planning methods or services that it considers morally unacceptable, that do not respect the liberty of spouses, human dignity or the human rights of those concerned.In particular, it could not be understood as endorsing [[Birth control|contraception]] or the use of [[Condom]]s, either as a family planning measure or in HIV/AIDS prevention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its.caltech.edu/~nmcenter/women-cp/beijing3.html Concluding statement of the Holy See at the Beijing Conference, 15 Set 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, the Holy See argued the education of [[Child|children]] and [[Adolescence|adolescents]], including in the area of sexual behavior, is primordially the responsibility of their parents, and not of the [[Sovereign state|State]]; and it urged the international community to guarantee the parents the full exercise of this rights and to assist them to carry out their responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/popin/icpd/conference/gov/940908193315.html Holy See opening statement at the Cairo Conference, 7 Set 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"My Heart Goes Boom"''' was the [[Norway|Norwegian]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000]], performed in [[English language|English]] by [[Charmed (group)|Charmed]].

The song is an up-tempo number, with the lyrics describing the first time a young woman saw her lover. Attracting most attention, however, were the lines "You were standing in the shadows, looking quite impossible/I lost my mind and popsicle". The unusual imagery (particularly when coupled with [[Sameach|Israel's entry]] of the same year featuring the line "I want a cucumber") has led some observers to describe the 2000 Contest as having a food theme.

The song was performed eighth on the night, following [[Malta]]'s [[Claudette Pace]] with "[[Desire (Eurovision song)|Desire]]" and preceding [[Russia]]'s [[Alsou]] with "[[Solo (Alsou song)|Solo]]". At the close of voting, it had received 57 points, placing 11th in a field of 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=315|title=Eurovision Song Contest 2000|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was succeeded as [[Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest|Norwegian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001 Contest]] by [[Haldor Lægreid]] with "[[On My Own (Haldor Lægreid song)|On My Own]]".

Rigatta was the first company that started to provide call-through services for the local call tariff in Latvia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Сколько стоит разговор с Россией?|date=April 18, 2007|publisher=Chas|pages=3|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2006, the first telecommunication service, Nulltel Managed Business, entered into the Latvian market. Nulltel Managed Business was aimed at business customers who wanted to utilize VoIP services and integrate these into their existing telephony systems. Nulltel Managed Business services have been re-branded with effect 1.1.2014 to the Rigatta brand.

In February 2007, Rigatta launched call-through services for the general public. These call-through services were available through local access numbers, so that anyone can call abroad for the local call tariff with a fixed phone. Since 2010 Nulltel Call-through services have been discontinued.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2968">'''Toubab''' or '''Toubabou''' is a [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[West Africa]]n name for a person of [[Europe]]an descent ("whites"). Used most frequently in [[The Gambia]], [[Senegal]], and [[Mali]], and also in Ivory Coast, the term does not have derogatory connotations by itself, but it is also frequently associated with "wealthy traveler" (if one can afford to travel, one must be rich). The word can also be applied to any perceived traveler, even those of black African descent with a different [[phenotype]], up to foreign-raised locals (thus with a different accent) or visiting [[expatriate]]s. In [[Alex Haley]]'s book ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family|Roots]]'', the phrase "toubab fa" (kill toubab) is used several times.

In [[God's Bits of Wood]], authored by Senegalese [[Sembene Ousmane]], the natives call the French colonizers ''toubab'' (singular) or ''toubabs'' (plural).

In the fourth episode of the miniseries ''ROOTS,'' Kizzy refers to her slave masters as "toubab," or white.

A verb in the [[Wolof language]] means "to convert" (missionaries during colonial times, being whites coming from Europe). The word could have derived from the two bob (two shilling) coin of pre-[[decimalisation]] United Kingdom.

In [[Ghana]] the word used for a white person or foreigner is [[Obroni]] in the local languages, of the [[Akan people|Akan]] family.

In [[Nigeria]], the word used for a 'white' person is ''[[Oyibo]]''.

In [[Togo]] and [[Benin]], the word used for a white person is 'yovo'.

In [[Burkina Faso]], the world for a white person is 'lansara'

In East Africa and Eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the word used for a white or foreign person is "[[muzungu]]".

In both the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and the [[Republic of the Congo]], the word used for a white person is "[[mondele]]" or "mundele".
