'''''2XL Fleet Defense''''' is an iOS game developed by American studio [[2XL Games]] and released on December 5, 2009.

==Critical reception==
TouchArcade gave the game a rating of 70%, writing " Fans of either of the aforementioned craft management games should find Fleet Defense to be a challenging (and enjoyably frustrating) twist on the formula. Fun isn't all about offroad racing, after all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toucharcade.com/2009/12/05/2xl-fleet-defense-war-on-the-open-seas/|title='2XL Fleet Defense': War on the Open Seas|date=5 December 2009|website=Toucharcade.com|accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appspy gave the game 3 out of 5, concluding "If you’re looking for a decent time killer then 2XL Fleet Defense is a good choice but don’t expect too much out of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appspy.com/review/3683/2xl-fleet-defense|title=2XL Fleet Defense Review|author=Damian Chiappara|date=11 December 2009|website=Appspy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; TheAppEra wrote "My overall impression on Fleet Defense was actually not bad. The game does have replay value and is able to keep you trying to pass level four, but it’s almost nearly impossible afterwards. Yet, I would still recommend it to any true gamer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theappera.com/2010/01/19/2xl-fleet-defense-review-2xl-can-do-great-casual-games-as-well/ |title=2XL Fleet Defense Review: 2XL Can Do Great CASUAL Games As Well! |publisher=The Appera |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006175337/http://theappera.com/2010/01/19/2xl-fleet-defense-review-2xl-can-do-great-casual-games-as-well/ |archivedate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''8 Million Ways to Die''''' is a 1986 American [[crime film|crime]] [[action thriller|action thriller film]] directed by [[Hal Ashby]] and starring [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Rosanna Arquette]], and, in a leading role for the first time, [[Andy Garcia]]. It was Ashby's final film, and the first attempt to adapt the [[Matthew Scudder]] detective stories of [[Lawrence Block]] for the screen. The screenplay was written by [[Oliver Stone]], an uncredited [[Robert Towne]] and David Lee Henry (R. Lance Hill using a pseudonym).

==Plot==
An alcoholic Los Angeles Sheriff's Deputy, Matt Scudder (Bridges), takes part in a drug bust that results in his fatal shooting of a small-time dealer in front of the man's wife and kids. Scudder ends up in a drunk ward, suffering from booze and blackouts, ending his career, his marriage, and jeopardizing his relationship with his daughter. 

After an [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meeting, a woman hands Scudder a note, which invites him to a private gambling club on a hill, accessible only by a [[funicular]], owned by Chance Walker ([[Randy Brooks (actor)|Randy Brooks]]). At the club, Scudder is greeted by a call girl named Sunny ([[Alexandra Paul]]) who pretends that he is her boyfriend. He also meets Angel Moldonado (Garcia), who places large wagers with Chance and is infatuated with another call girl there, Sarah (Arquette).

Bewildered by Sunny's behavior, Scudder ends up back at his place, where after a failed attempt to seduce him, Sunny explains that she is frightened and needs help. After she pays him $5,000, Scudder offers Chance $2,500 to allow Sunny to quit prostitution. An insulted Chance  insists that all he does is run the club, paying the girls a flat salary to attend his parties. Any prostitution they do is up to them.

Sunny is kidnapped in front of Scudder and, during a chase, is murdered and thrown off a bridge. Scudder goes on a binge and wakes up in a drunk ward several days later. It transpires that he gave statements to detectives before getting drunk that have implicated himself and Chance in the murder. At the club, Moldonado wears a ring with an emerald that matched the missing jewel in a necklace that Sunny owned. Convinced now that Moldonado is her killer, Scudder persuades Sarah to leave the club with him, as a jealous Moldonado looks on. Sarah fails to get Scudder to drink with her, then tries to initiate sex but is too drunk and vomits on his bed.

Scudder pieces together that Moldonado is running a drug ring through Chance's legitimate businesses. Setting up a meeting where he pretends to set up a drug buy, Scudder has a confrontation with Moldonado, who forces Sarah to leave with him. Chance is furious that Moldonado has been using him and that he killed Sunny, but Scudder convinces him to go along with the drug deal, in order to trap Moldonado. 

At Moldonado's house, a unique one designed by [[Antoni Gaudí]], a suspicious Moldonado puts off any talk of drugs. He taunts Scudder about Sunny's death and carefully implies she was killed to scare off others who would cross him. Moldonado knows that Scudder is or was a cop, so is wary of being trapped in a sting. Scudder notices a package from a supermarket Chance owns. Deducing that the drugs were stashed there, Scudder and Chance go to the grocery store and find the hidden cocaine. Scudder offers to return them in exchange for Sarah.

At an empty warehouse, Moldonado arrives with Sarah duct-taped to a shotgun that one of his underlings is holding. Scudder in turn has booby-trapped the drugs and threatens to destroy them if Sarah is harmed. After seeing some of his cocaine burned, Moldonado agrees to cut Sarah loose, but before he can secure his drugs, a shootout erupts between Moldonado's men and undercover drug agents who have accompanied Scudder to the scene. Moldonado manages to escape in the chaos, but Chance is killed.

Sarah and Scudder head back to Chance's club, and as they ride the funicular up to the house, they see Moldonado standing at the top, waiting for them. Scudder manages to kill him in a tense gunfight. Scudder is later seen attending an AA meeting, then strolling happily with Sarah on a beach.

'''Arturo Brachetti''' ({{IPA-it|arˈtuːro braˈketti}}; born 13 October 1957) is an Italian [[quick-change (stage)|quick-change]] artist considered the best quick change performer in the world. In the Guinness Book of Records he is described as the quickest and most prolific quick change artist in the world.&lt;ref&gt;The most prolific quick change illusion artist in [[Guinness World Records]] [http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/12000/most-prolific-quick-change-illusion-artist]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Brachetti was born in [[Turin]]. His career covers a wide artistic range and has made him an international name.
The change from one costume to another is performed in a matter of seconds, often by throwing a sheet up and completely changing costume by the time it falls. In the current show, Brachetti performs 80 characters in one evening. His skills are including also [[shadowgraphy (performing art)|shadowgraphy]]&lt;ref&gt;Hand shadows performance in [[Thames TV]], 1989 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPdbfvT-x0E&amp;list=PLeZNO2izuoi9nir5GpyUQ_comp9BD4e6q]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.priulieverlucca.it/catalogo/scheda/Le-ombre-cinesi/375 Arturo Brachetti, Le ombre cinesi]&lt;/ref&gt; and sand painting.&lt;ref&gt;Sand painting performance on italian national tv Rai2, Made in Sud, 22 aprile 2014 [http://www.rai.tv/dl/RaiTV/programmi/media/ContentItem-968d0529-8c7f-4306-8e85-6ca85ddd4e0d.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, he frequented a seminary, where he met a young priest, [[Silvio Mantelli]], with the hobby of magic. Spending most of his time in the magical warehouse of the priest, Brachetti learnt all kind of magic tricks. At the age of 15, using costumes borrowed from the seminary's theatre, he invented and performed his first quick-change act, an art introduced to the world by [[Leopoldo Fregoli]] (1867-1936).

His professional career began in 1978 in France at the parisian cabaret [[Paradis Latin]], under the direction of Jean Marie Rivière. This led to a starring role in [[André Heller]]'s German production of "Flic Flac"(1981). From Germany he went to England, appearing at London's [[Piccadilly Theatre]] starring in the production of "Y" which ran for just over a year (1983–84).  He was nominated for the prestigious [[Society of West End Theatre Awards|Society of West End Theatre Award]]. That same year he performed at "The Covent Garden Christmas Gala" in the presence of the British Royal Family.

On his return to Italy, he participated as the guest star in 10 episodes of the television show ''[[Al paradise]]'' for the Italian national television [[RAI]] (1985). It was after this that he was introduced to the Italian theatre scene. This led to a string of successful theatre productions (M. Butterfly, L'Histoire du Soldat, Varietà, In Principio Arturo, Amami Arturo, Il Mistero dei Bastardi Assassini, I Massibilli, etc.), and television appearances, making him one of the most critically acclaimed young actors of the Italian stage. He also memorably performed as the interval act at the [[1991 Eurovision Song Contest]] in [[Rome]].
  
He returned to London to perform in [[Tony Harrison]]'s production of "Square Rounds" at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]]. In 1989 and 1990 he was also a regular performer on ''[[The Best of Magic]]'' for [[Thames Television]]. Then off to [[Disneyland Paris]] where, with [[Mickey Mouse]], he co-hosted the show ''A Night of Magic'', which was transmitted internationally.

From 1995, with the Italian production company Compagnia Della Rancia and the director Saverio Marconi, Brachetti continued to concentrate on creating and developing musicals for the Italian audience. His original musical "Fregoli" won the Biglietto D'Oro (Golden Ticket Award) for the best selling show in a season (280,000 tickets). His popularity continued with the production of "Brachetti in Technicolor" and "Midsummer Night's Dream".

In the opera field, he played the storyteller in Stravinsky's "[[Histoire du soldat]]", "[[Peter and the wolf]]"(2011)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rai.tv/dl/portali/site/news/ContentItem-43c8e866-2110-4b44-b021-f4ab66522b11.html Pierino e il lupo]&lt;/ref&gt;  and "Allegro un po' troppo" (2013).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rai.it/dl/portali/site/articolo/ContentItem-16c13800-33f4-42ea-91b9-941cebdaa3ba.html Rai for Allegro un po' troppo]&lt;/ref&gt;

His appearance on a live episode of ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'' in 1999 gave him a "pick of the day" title on the program [[Access Hollywood]]. He also played a role in the Warner sitcom [[Nikki (TV series)|Nikki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/shows/nikki/cast/ Nikki cast in tv.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/people/arturo-brachetti/ Arturo Brachetti profile on Tv.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 he presented his new show in [[Montreal]], produced by the [[Just for laughs]] festival. With his one-man-show "The Man With a Thousand Faces" which featured more than 80 transformations. The show won the [[Moliere Award]] in Paris and then the Canadian Olivier Award the same year. After 700 sold-out performances in Paris, the show went on tour in French-speaking countries, Germany and several cities in the USA.
In 2003 [[Jeffery Deaver]] named Brachetti in his bestseller [[The Vanished Man]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jefferydeaver.com/novel/the-vanished-man/interview/ Intervies with Jeffery Deaver]&lt;/ref&gt;
In Christmas 2004, he was invited to perform in the [[Élysée Palace]] in Paris in the presence of President [[Chirac]].

In 2006, Brachetti's show reached the proportion of a big musical production with over 1000 performances completed and in excess of 1.5 million tickets sold.

Brachetti directed several shows from 1994 onwards. In Germany: "Fantasissimo" and "1000 Nachte" at the [[Berlin Wintergarten theatre|Wintergarten]] Theatre in Berlin; in Italy: "I Corti", "Tel chi el Telun", "Meta fisico metà fa schifo" and the tour of singer [[Angelo Branduardi]].

'''''Beavis and Butt-Head''''' is an American [[Adult animation|adult]] [[animated sitcom]] created by [[Mike Judge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-22/entertainment/ca-556_1_mike-judge|title=That's Mr. Beavis and Butt-head to You|last=Strauss|first=Robert|date=November 22, 1994|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series originated from ''[[Frog Baseball]]'', a 1992 short film by Judge originally aired on ''[[Liquid Television]]''. After seeing the short, [[MTV]] signed Judge to develop the short into a full series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-16/entertainment/ca-664_1_animation-festival|title=MTV Toon Dudes Are Slow on Two Counts Television|last=Cerone|first=Daniel|date=March 16, 1993|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/nov/26/entertainment/ca-57733|title=Butt-head, We Hardly Knew Ye|last=Rosenberg|first=Howard|date=November 26, 1997|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series originally ran for seven seasons from March 8, 1993 to November 28, 1997. Fourteen years following the end of the series, the series was revived for an eighth season which aired from October 27 to December 29, 2011. A theatrical feature-length film based on the series titled ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head Do America]]'' was released in 1996 by [[Paramount Pictures]].

== Premise ==
{{See also|List of Beavis and Butt-Head characters}}
The series centers on two socially incompetent [[Juvenile delinquency|teenage delinquents]] and [[sedentary lifestyle|couch potatoes]] named [[Beavis]] and [[Butt-Head]] (both voiced by Judge), who go to school at Highland High in Highland, Texas. They lack evident adult supervision at home and are dimwitted, undereducated and barely literate. Both lack any empathy or moral scruples, even regarding each other. They will usually deem things they encounter as "cool" if they are associated with [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], violence, sex, destruction or the [[macabre]]. While inexperienced with females, they both share an obsession with sex and tend to chuckle whenever they hear words or phrases that could even be interpreted as sexual or [[scatology|scatological]].

Each episode features frequent interstitial scenes in which they critique [[Music video|music videos]] using commentary improvised by Judge (much in the same way as ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''; in season eight, they also commented on clips from other MTV shows such as ''[[The Jersey Shore]]'' and ''[[True Life]]'', plus shows from other [[Viacom]]-owned networks such as [[Paramount Network|Spike]]). The remainder of the episodes depict the duo embarking on some kind of scheme or adventure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-08-02/features/1997214087_1_beavis-and-butt-head-butt-head-do-america-groupie|title=Goodbye, cool world TV: Beavis and Butt-head, nasty, dumb, hysterical little boogers, are going off the air.

Their actions sometimes result in serious consequences but often for others in which they themselves do not express any remorse.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
Over its run, ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' drew a notable amount of both positive and negative reaction from the public with its combination of lewd humor and implied criticism of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/17/arts/television-keeping-beavis-and-butt-head-just-stupid-enough.html?scp=4&amp;sq=Beavis%20and%20Butt-Head&amp;st=cse|title=TELEVISION; Keeping Beavis and Butt-Head Just Stupid Enough|last=Kolbert|first=Elizabeth|date=October 17, 1993|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the focus of criticism from some social critics, such as [[Michael Medved]] while others such as [[David Letterman]] and the ''[[National Review]],'' defended it as a cleverly subversive vehicle for social criticism and a particularly creative and intelligent comedy. Either way, the show captured the attention of many young television viewers and is often considered a classic piece of 1990s youth culture and [[Generation X]]. [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], creators of ''[[South Park]],'' cite the series as an influence and compared it to the [[blues]].&lt;ref&gt;"Taint of Greatness: The Journey of Beavis and Butt-Head Part 2," in ''The Mike Judge Collection'' Volume 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Dan Tobin of ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]'' commented on the series' humor, stating that it transformed "stupidity into a crusade, forcing us to acknowledge how little it really takes to make us laugh."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archive/tv/97/11/BEAVIS_AND_BUTTHEAD.html|title=Butting out|last=Tobin|first=Dan|date=November 26, 1997|work=[[The Boston Phoenix]]|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228022024/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archive/tv/97/11/BEAVIS_AND_BUTTHEAD.html|archive-date=February 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Ted Drozdowski of ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]'' described the 1997 ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' state as "reduced to self-parody of their self-parody."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bostonphoenix.com/archive/tv/97/05/TEN_REASONS.html|title=Eye pleasers|last=Drozdowski|first=Ted|date=May 8, 1997|work=[[The Boston Phoenix]]|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203205756/http://bostonphoenix.com/archive/tv/97/05/TEN_REASONS.html|archive-date=February 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2005, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked the duo's distinct laughing at #66 on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvland.com/originals/catchphrases/quotes.jhtml The 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313194321/http://www.tvland.com/originals/catchphrases/quotes.jhtml |date=2008-03-13 }}, TV Guide.

Mike Judge himself is highly critical of the animation and quality of earlier episodes, in particular the first two—''Give Blood''/''Blood Drive'' and ''Door to Door''—which he described as "awful, I don't know why anybody liked it... I was burying my head in the sand."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Taint of Greatness: The Story of Beavis and Butt-Head Part 1", in ''The Mike Judge Collection'' Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism and controversies ===
Early episodes depicted a juvenile obsession with fire and other dangerous behaviors, summed up with Beavis's chanting of "Fire! Fire!". The show was blamed for the death of two-year-old Jessica Matthews in [[Moraine, Ohio]], in October 1993. The girl's five-year-old brother, Austin, set fire to his mother's mobile home with a [[Lighter|cigarette lighter]], killing the two-year-old.&lt;ref name="nyt2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/us/cartoon-on-mtv-blamed-for-fire.html|title=Cartoon On MTV Blamed For Fire|last=|first=|date=October 10, 1993|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 29, 2010|agency=[[The Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, MTV pulled the episode temporarily. The mother later claimed that her son watched one of the fire-related segments shortly before he burned down the home.&lt;ref name="nyt2" /&gt; However, neighbors claimed that the family didn't even have [[cable television]], and was unable to view the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rolling Stone|date=March 24, 1994|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, all references to fire were removed from subsequent airings. The creators found a censorship [[loophole]] and took delight in sometimes making Beavis scream things that sounded very similar to his previous "Fire! Fire!" (such as "Fryer! Fryer!" when he and Butt-Head are working the late shift at Burger World) and also having him almost say the forbidden word (such as one time when he sang "Liar, liar, pants on..." and pausing before "fire" ("Liar! Liar!"). There was also a music video where a man runs on fire in slow motion ("California" by [[Wax (rock band)|Wax]]). Beavis is hypnotized by it and can barely say "fire". However, MTV eventually removed the episode entirely. References to fire were cut from earlier episodes — even the original master tapes were altered permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sonic.net/~goblin/9beavis.html|title="Heh-Heh-Heh...

Copies of early episodes with the controversial content intact are rare, and the copies that exist are made from home video recordings of the original broadcasts. In an interview included with the ''Mike Judge Collection'' DVD set, Judge said he is uncertain whether some of the earlier episodes still exist in their original, uncensored form. {{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

When the series returned in 2011, MTV allowed Beavis to use the word "fire" once again uncensored.&lt;ref name="RS-2010-08-03"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/exclusive-mike-judge-on-the-return-of-beavis-and-butt-head-20100803|title=Exclusive: Mike Judge on the Return of 'Beavis and Butt-Head'|last=Greene|first=Andy|date=August 3, 2011|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6329GV68w?url=http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/exclusive-mike-judge-on-the-return-of-beavis-and-butt-head-20110803|archivedate=November 8, 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first video segment, "[[Werewolves of Highland]]", the first new episode of the revival, Beavis utters the word "fire" a total of 7 times within 28 seconds, with Butt-head saying it once as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= [[Werewolves of Highland]] |series= Beavis and Butt-head |network=MTV |date= October 27, 2011|season=8 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1994, watchdog group [[Morality in Media]] claimed that the death of eight-month-old Natalia Rivera, struck by a [[bowling ball]] thrown from an overpass onto a highway in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], near the [[Holland Tunnel]] by 18-year-old Calvin J. Settle, was partially inspired by ''Beavis and Butt-Head''.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/10/nyregion/youth-is-held-in-death-from-bowling-ball.html?pagewanted=all|title=Youth Is Held In Death From Bowling Ball|last=Levy|first=Clifford J.|date=February 10, 1994|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group said that Settle was influenced by the episode "Ball Breakers", in which Beavis and Butt-Head load a bowling ball with explosives and drop it from a rooftop.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; While Morality in Media claimed that the show inspired Settle's actions, the case's prosecutors did not. It was later revealed by both prosecutors and the defendant that Settle did not have cable TV, nor did he watch the show.

In "Lightning Strikes", the show parodies the desire to blame actions on youth culture. When asked by a reporter why they were flying a kite in a thunderstorm, the duo explained that they were inspired by a documentary about [[Benjamin Franklin]], who Butt-head describes as "some old dude with long hair and glasses". The reporter asks if it was [[Howard Stern]], and when Butt-head answers "no", she asks if he has ever listened to Stern's radio program. The reporter continues to ask them questions until they mention that they had watched rock music videos earlier in the day. The reporter then concludes on the air that music videos are to blame for the duo's actions.

MTV also responded by broadcasting the program after 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., and included a disclaimer, reminding viewers:
:Beavis and Butt-Head are not real. They are stupid cartoon people completely made up by this Texas guy whom we hardly even know. Beavis and Butt-Head are dumb, crude, thoughtless, ugly, sexist, self-destructive fools. But for some reason, the little wienerheads make us laugh.
This was later changed to:
:Beavis and Butt-Head are not role models. They're not even human. They're cartoons. Some of the things they do would cause a person to get hurt, expelled, arrested, possibly [[deported]]. To put it another way: don't try this at home.
This disclaimer also appears before the opening of their [[Sega Genesis]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] games as well as their [[Windows]] game ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head in Virtual Stupidity]]''.

They were famously lambasted by [[South Carolina]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] senator [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] as "Buffcoat and Beaver".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/1997/08/15/end-beavis-and-butt-head/|title=Dude...

For example, one character on the show, Tom Anderson, originally called them "Butthole" and "Joe", and believed the two to be of Asian ethnicity (describing them to the police as "[[Oriental]]"). In later episodes, Tom Anderson uses the Hollings mispronunciation once, and on at least one occasion refers to them as "Penis and Butt-Munch". [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] called them "Beavis and Bum-head" in "Citizen Butt-head", as well as in the [[Beavis and Butt-head Do America|movie]], where an old lady (voiced by [[Cloris Leachman]]) consistently calls them "Travis" and "Bob-head". In "Incognito", when another student threatens to kill them, the duo uses this to their advantage, pretending to be exchange students named "Crevis and Bung-Head". The bully, seeing through the disguises, calls them "Beaver and Butt-Plug". In "Right On!", when the duo appear on the ''Gus Baker Show'', host Gus Baker (a caricature of [[Rush Limbaugh]]) introduces them as "Beavis and Buffcoat".

Beavis and Butt-Head have been compared to [[Savant syndrome|idiot savants]] because of their creative and subversively intelligent observations of music videos. This part of the show was mostly improvised by Mike Judge. With regard to criticisms of the two as "idiots", Judge responded that a show about straight-A students would not be funny.

== Film ==
{{Main article|Beavis and Butt-Head Do America}}
In 1996, a full-length film featuring the duo titled ''Beavis and Butt-Head Do America'' was released in theaters. The film features the voices of [[Bruce Willis]], [[Demi Moore]], [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Robert Stack]], [[Eric Bogosian]], [[Richard Linklater]], [[Greg Kinnear]] (in an uncredited role) and [[David Letterman]] (credited as Earl Hofert). It gained mostly positive reviews from film critics and a "two thumbs up" from [[Gene Siskel|Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert|Ebert]]. The film earned over $60 million at the domestic box office, a strong return for a film that cost only $12 million to produce.

In the years following, many fans rumored the possibility of a sequel or follow-up to the film, tentatively titled ''Beavis and Butt-Head: The Sequel''&lt;ref name="screenrant.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/beavis-and-butt-head-movie-mike-judge-kofi-23670/|title=Beavis and Butt-Head: The Sequel?|last=Outlaw|first=Kofi|date=August 31, 2009|website=[[Screen Rant]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610183835/https://screenrant.com/beavis-and-butt-head-movie-mike-judge/|archive-date=June 10, 2017|dead-url=No|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Beavis and Butt-Head 2''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Comic-Con-Mike-Judge-Teases-Beavis-Butt-Head-2-14086.html&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, 2009, during the promotion of ''[[Extract (film)|Extract]]'', Mike Judge stated that he would like to see Beavis and Butt-Head on the big screen again.&lt;ref name="screenrant.com"/&gt;

== Revival ==
On July 14, 2010, a spokesperson for MTV Networks informed a ''[[New York Post]]'' reporter that Mike Judge was creating a new ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' series, that Judge would reprise his voice-acting roles for the show, and that the animation would be hand-drawn. According to [[TMZ]], MTV had not asked [[Tracy Grandstaff]] to reprise her role as [[Daria Morgendorffer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2011/02/05/beavis-butthead-daria-morgendorffer-mtv-show-mike-judge/|title=Daria Left Out of 'Beavis and Butt-Head' Reboot| publisher=TMZ| date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview, Judge was asked if ''Daria'' was coming back, and he said: "No. There's sort of a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in one episode. That'll be a surprise."&lt;ref name="RS-2011-08-03"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/exclusive-mike-judge-on-the-return-of-beavis-and-butt-head-20100803|title=Exclusive: Mike Judge on the Return of 'Beavis and Butt-Head'|last=Greene|first=Andy|date=August 3, 2011|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6329GV68w?url=http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/exclusive-mike-judge-on-the-return-of-beavis-and-butt-head-20110803|archivedate=November 8, 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the old series, Beavis and Butt-head are high school students who, among other things, criticize contemporary music videos.&lt;ref name="revival"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/they_re_back_PZVN8lcKHQYVIYx3xAJRtM|title=They're back!|last=Starr|first=Michael|date=July 14, 2010|work=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=July 14, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716203405/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/they_re_back_PZVN8lcKHQYVIYx3xAJRtM|archivedate=July 16, 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''Rolling Stone'', MTV president [[Van Toffler]] said that the duo will also watch ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'', [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] matches, and amateur videos from [[YouTube]], as well as give movie reviews.

John Altschuler, formerly a writer for ''[[King of the Hill]]'', told a ''Rolling Stone'' reporter that he saw signs that Mike Judge was thinking of reviving ''Beavis and Butt-head''. On more than one occasion, Judge told the writers that one of their ideas for an episode of ''King of the Hill'' would work well for ''Beavis and Butt-head''; eventually he concluded, "Maybe we should just actually make some good ''Beavis and Butt-head'' episodes." Later, a [[Lady Gaga]] video convinced Van Toffler of the tenability of a ''Beavis and Butt-head'' revival: "I felt like there was a whole crop of new artists—and what the world sorely missed was the point-of-view that only Beavis and Butt-Head could bring."&lt;ref name=rs /&gt;

As part of a promotional campaign for the new series, cinemas screening ''[[Jackass 3D]]'' opened the [[feature film]] with a [[3-D film|3-D]] ''Beavis and Butt-head'' short subject. Months later, in a media presentation on February 2, 2010, MTV announced that the series would premiere in mid-2011. On July 21, 2011 Mike Judge spoke and fielded questions on a panel at [[Comic-Con International]]. A preview of the episode "Holy Cornholio" was also shown.&lt;ref&gt;Sitterson, Aubrey.

UGO. 21 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Judge told ''Rolling Stone'' that at least 24 episodes (12 half-hour programs) will definitely air.&lt;ref name="RS-2011-08-03" /&gt; It was initially rumored that Judge was working on 30 new episodes for the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geeksofdoom.com/2010/07/07/is-mike-judge-working-on-30-new-episodes-of-beavis-and-butt-head|title=Is Mike Judge Working On 30 New Episodes Of 'Beavis And Butt-Head'?|author=|first=|date=July 7, 2010|website=Geeks of Doom|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential future ===
On January 10, 2014, Mike Judge announced that, while he is busy working on ''[[Silicon Valley (TV series)|Silicon Valley]]'', there is a chance of him pitching ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' to another network and that he wouldn't mind making more episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/tv/articles/628453-mike-judge-says-beavis-and-butt-head-are-trapped-in-limbo|title=Mike Judge: 'Beavis and Butt-Head' Trapped in Limbo|last=Topel|first=Fred|date=January 10, 2014|website=|publisher=CraveOnline|archive-url=|archive-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While giving an interview to [[Howard Stern]] on May 6, 2014, Judge mentioned that the show's ratings on MTV were second only to ''Jersey Shore'', but the show didn't fit MTV's target demographic of young women, which is why the revived series has not been brought back on MTV. He also said that MTV was close to selling it to another network, but it became "lost in deal stuff".&lt;ref name="stern2014"&gt;{{cite|title=Howard Stern interview with Mike Judge|date=May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|at=37m}}

In interviews, Judge has stated his interest in producing a live-action film and [[Johnny Depp]] has expressed interest in the role of Beavis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slashfilm|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/mike-judge-talks-live-action-beavis-and-butt-head-film-johnny-depp-hoped-to-play-beavis/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, Judge said that he previously hated the idea, but now believes that "maybe there's something there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/05/16/beavis_and_butthead_to_make_a_big_screen |title='Beavis And Butthead' To Make A Big Screen Return—Starpulse Entertainment News Blog |publisher=Starpulse.com |accessdate=2010-10-29 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview for Collider on August 25, 2008, Judge said, "I like to keep the door open on ''Beavis and Butt-Head'', because it's my favorite thing that I've ever done. It's the thing I'm most proud of." However, he also added, "Another movie... the problem is it takes a year and half, two years, two and a half years—maybe—to do that right. And that's a pretty strong level of commitment. I'm going to look at that again. That comes up every three years." One of his ideas is bringing back the characters as old men, instead of teenagers. "I kind of think of them as being either 15 or in their 60s," he said. "I wouldn't mind doing something with them as these two dirty old men sitting on the couch." Judge added that he would not completely ignore the time that has passed in between.

In 2016, Judge told [[RadioTimes.com]] that "Maybe it could be a live-action someday" and went on to speculate that Beavis might be homeless by now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In March 2018, Judge told [[Rotten Tomatoes]] that the idea of doing a second ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' movie had been brought up two months prior, stating that "It’s just a matter of coming up with an idea that feels like it’s worth doing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mike Judge Might Bring Back King of the Hill with an Older Bobby and Do Another Beavis and Butt-Head Movie|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/mike-judge-might-bring-back-king-of-the-hill-with-an-older-bobby-and-do-another-beavis-and-butt-head-movie/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Home video == 
MTV Home Video, in collaboration with [[Sony Music Entertainment]], released several episodes of the show on [[VHS]] from 1995 through 1999. A total of eleven VHS compilation tapes were released in the U.S., U.K. and Australia, each containing around eight episodes, but without the music video segments from the original broadcastings. These include the "Beavis and Butthead Do Christmas" and "Butt-O-Ween" specials, which were given stand-alone releases.

A single [[LaserDisc]] volume titled ''Beavis and Butt-Head: The Essential Collection'' was released on June 27, 1994. It contains all the episodes from ''Work Sucks!'' on one side and the episodes from ''There Goes the Neighborhood'' on the other side. The volumes ''The Final Judgment'' and ''Beavis &amp; Butt-head Do Christmas'' were also released on [[DVD]] during the early days of the format.

===Time Life===
All of the U.S. VHS Volumes were later issued on DVD in five two-disc sets through the [[Time Life]] organization. The DVD releases were titled ''The Best of Beavis and Butt-Head''. The third DVD release of Beavis and Butt-Head was two series of three-disc sets released by Time-Life in December 2002.

The first set in the series contained the same program content of six of the Beavis and Butt-Head VHS compilations previously released by Sony Music Video from 1994 to 1999: Butt-O-Ween, Beavis and Butt-Head Do Christmas, Innocence Lost, Chicks 'n' Stuff, Feel Our Pain, and Troubled Youth, with two VHS compilations combined into a single disc. The set was advertised considerably on networks such as Comedy Central and on the Time-Life website.

Sometime after the first release, a second set of Time-Life Beavis and Butt-Head DVDs was released. This set contained the programs of the remaining SMV VHS compilations: Work Sucks, There Goes the Neighborhood, The Final Judgement, Law-Abiding Citizens, and Hard Cash. Two of the discs in the set once again contained the program content of two of the VHS tapes, while the last disc (Hard Cash) contained only the content of the final VHS program, but did additionally include 4 of the music video segments from the original broadcasts with Beavis and Butt-Head commentating. The second Time-Life set was not advertised, and subsequently became rarer. They also released VHS version of the Time Life collection.

===''The History of Beavis and Butt-Head''===

Paramount announced the release of a two-disc DVD set titled ''The History of Beavis and Butt-Head'' which was scheduled for release in September 2002 in the United States. However, its release was cancelled at the last moment at the demand of Judge, who owned approval rights for video releases of the series. According to Judge, the ''History'' set was made up of episodes that he had previously rejected for home video release and had been prepared without his knowledge or consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson |first=Tasha |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23060 |title=Mike Judge |publisher=The A.V. Club |accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, half of the 32 episodes on ''The History of Beavis and Butt-Head'' weren't included on later releases of the series, including all but two episodes on the first disc.

Many copies were mistakenly put on store shelves on the scheduled release date, only to be immediately recalled. The set started selling on [[eBay]] at very high prices, sometimes over $300 USD, as well as fetching over $1000 USD in new condition on websites such as Amazon.

===''The Mike Judge Collection''===
MTV and [[Paramount home entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]] released on November 8, 2005 a three-disc DVD compilation titled ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head: The Mike Judge Collection]]'', Volume 1. The DVD set includes 40 episodes and 11 music video segments from the original shows. The set was followed by Volume 2 and Volume 3. On January 27, 2008, MTV and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] made all three collections available on the [[iTunes Store]]. A Blu-ray and DVD release of Season 8, titled ''Beavis and Butt-Head – Volume 4'', was released on February 15, 2012 in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Beavis-Butt-head-Volume-4/16232 ''Beavis and Butt-head – Volume 4''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122203845/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Beavis-Butt-head-Volume-4/16232 |date=2011-11-22 }} at TV Shows on DVD&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2017, MTV released ''Beavis and Butt-Head - The Complete Collection'', a 12-disc set containing all four previous released volumes of ''The Mike Judge Collection'', along with a special collector's edition of ''Beavis and Butt-Head Do America''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lambert |first=David |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Beavis-Butt-head-Complete-Collection/22838 |title=Beavis and Butt-head - 'The Complete Collection' is a Sweetheart DVD for 2017 |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |accessdate=2017-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730114509/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Beavis-Butt-head-Complete-Collection/22838 |archivedate=2017-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many music video segments and content from other third parties were never released due to licensing issues with the rights holders. Early episodes featuring Beavis and Butt-Head engaging in unusually cruel and criminal activities were never released due to Mike Judge and MTV's dislike of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdist.com/beavis-and-butt-heads-complete-collection-dvd-review/|title=Why BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD’s Incomplete "Complete Collection" May Be the Closest We’ll Come|publisher=''[[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist]]''|author=Luke Y.

== Related media ==
=== Marvel Comics ===
From 1994 to 1996, [[Marvel Comics]] published a monthly ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' comic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotextra.com/bandbcollectiblescomics.html |title=Beavis and Butthead Central |publisher=Hotextra.com |accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the [[Marvel Absurd]] imprint by a variety of writers, but with each issue drawn by artist Rick Parker. It was also reprinted by Marvel UK, which created new editorial material.

The letters page was answered by Beavis and Butt-Head or one of their supporting characters. Instead of reviewing music videos, they reviewed (custom-made) pages from other Marvel Comics. In their review of a [[Ghost Rider]] comic, Beavis tries to avoid using the word "fire" to describe the character's fiery skull.

In the comic, minor characters like Earl, Billy Bob, Clark Cobb, and Mistress Cora Anthrax would get repeated appearances; Earl was quite regular, and Anthrax was in two issues and got to answer a letter's page.

=== ''Daria'' spin-off ===
{{Main article|Daria}}
In 1997, a spin-off show based on their classmate Daria Morgendorffer, ''[[Daria]]'', was created. Mike Judge was not credited as a producer of this series and has said he was not involved with it at all, except to give permission for the use of the character. The Daria character had been created for ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' by [[Glenn Eichler]] and originally designed by Bill Peckmann of J.J. Sedelmaier Productions, Inc. Eichler then became a producer for ''Daria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Brainy 'Beavis' Pal 'Daria' Spins Off |publisher= Los Angeles Times|date=March 3, 1997|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1997-03-03/entertainment/ca-34294_1_daria-morgendorffer|accessdate=2010-11-20 | first=Howard | last=Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first episode of ''Daria'', she and her family move from Beavis and Butt-Head's hometown of Highland to Lawndale—the only references to the original show is a single mention of Highland in the first episode, with Daria saying Lawndale can't be a second Highland "unless there's uranium in the drinking water here too".

== Races ==
Eight races are included in the ''Blood Bowl 2'' base game. These are the Humans, Orcs, Dwarfs, Skaven, High Elves, Dark Elves, Bretonnians, and Chaos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bloodbowl-game.com/bloodbowl2/races|title = Blood Bowl 2|date = |accessdate = September 19, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also two races that are obtained as a pre-order bonus. The Wood Elves can be obtained by pre-ordering the game for Xbox One, and the Lizardmen can be obtained by pre-ordering the game for the PlayStation 4. If the game was pre-ordered through Steam, both races are available.

On December 17, 2015, Cyanide announced that they would be adding four new races into the game, starting from the Norse (released on May 2016), followed by Undead (released on July 2016), Necromantic (released on September 2016), and Nurgle (released on November 2016). Players who purchased Blood Bowl 2 on steam (but not on consoles) before the release of these races received them for free as they were gradually rolled out.
In February 2017, two new playable races - Chaos Dwarfs and Khemri - were released as DLC.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sykes|first1=Tom|title=Blood Bowl 2 is getting four new races, free if you already own the game|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/blood-bowl-2-is-getting-four-new-races-free-if-you-already-own-the-game/|website=PCGamer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Features ===
Several new and improved features have been added since the first ''Blood Bowl'' game.  These new features include the new Campaign mode, Stadium Customization, Cabalvision, and the Player Marketplace.

;Campaign Mode
In Campaign Mode, the player follows the story of the Reikland Reavers, a team in disgrace.  It is the player's job, as the team's coach, to raise them back to their former glory.  Beyond the standard game play that can be found in League and Multiplayer modes, Campaign Mode includes a number of scripted, one-time events, such as a goblin crashing a helicopter in the middle of the field.  When these events occur, the player has to continue play around them.

;Stadium customization
The base game includes five stadiums for customization.  These are stadiums that originate with the Human, Orc, Dwarf, Dark Elf and Skaven.  As players grow their teams, they can also grow their stadium.  The stadium can be raised through four tiers, with 10 add-ons, for a total of 20 possible unique stadiums.

;Cabalvision
Cabalvision is ''Blood Bowl 2''{{'}}s version of sports commentary. Play-by-play announcer (and immortal vampire) Jim Johnson injects his witty commentary alongside analyst Bob Bifford's forthright preference to sheer violence, providing the player with a colourful commentary based on the teams, players, and the action happening on the field.

;Player marketplace
Because of the brutal nature of Blood Bowl, teams will often have to find more players to field&amp;mdash;due to death, injury, or retirement&amp;mdash;or to make some extra money.

It has a score of 76% on Metacritic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/blood-bowl-2|title=Blood Bowl 2 for PC reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=July 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PC Gamer]] awarded Blood Bowl 2 60%, saying "Blood Bowl 2 is the flashiest iteration of the game so far, but its dice rolls are frustrating, and its ample ruleset isn't introduced well to newcomers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/blood-bowl-2-review/|title=Blood Bowl 2 review|first=James |last=Davenport|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=September 22, 2015|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] awarded it 7.8 out of 10, saying "Blood Bowl 2 is a smashy, satisfying, goofy tactical melee that leaves just a bit too much up to the six-sided dice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/09/23/blood-bowl-2-review|title=Blood Bowl 2 review|first=TJ|last=Hafer|work=[[IGN]]|date=September 22, 2015|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameSpot]] awarded it a score of 8 out of 10, saying "Yet overall, Blood Bowl 2 is a step forward. It's a much friendlier, easier game than its predecessors, with improved looks, a tutorial campaign, controller support, and the UI improvements. New players won't feel blocked off from enjoying it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blood-bowl-2-review/1900-6416252/|title=Blood Bowl 2 review|first=Dan|last= Griliopoulos |work=[[GameSpot]]|date=September 22, 2015|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bothwell Browne''' (born '''Walter Bothwell Bruhn'''; 1877 &amp;ndash; 1947) was a Danish-American stage and film performer, best known as a [[female impersonator]].

Born in Copenhagen, Browne grew up in San Francisco &lt;ref&gt;http://fan.tcm.com/_Bothwell-Browne-a-drag-queen-of-the-Silents/blog/3170269/66470.html&lt;/ref&gt; and developed a vaudeville act.  At one point he was performing as a duo with male impersonator [[Kathleen Clifford]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaudeville old &amp; new: an encyclopedia of variety performances in ..., Volume 1 By Frank Cullen, Florence Hackman, Donald McNeilly, page 150&lt;/ref&gt;  He was in New York by 1908, when the New York Times reports him as suing [[Texas Guinan]] over the rights to a [[Gibson Girl]] stage act.

Deliberately or not, Browne competed with the better-known female impersonator [[Julian Eltinge]].  Some audiences, and theater managers, found his act more seductive and therefore more unsettling than Eltinge.&lt;ref&gt;Vaudeville old &amp; new: an encyclopedia of variety performances in ..., Volume 1 By Frank Cullen, Florence Hackman, Donald McNeilly, page 150&lt;/ref&gt;   Browne's Broadway production ''Miss Jack'' opened in September 1911 at the [[Herald Square Theater]], exactly one week before Eltinge's more successful ''[[The Fascinating Widow]]''.

Browne's only film appearance is the 1919 [[Mack Sennett]] production ''[[Yankee Doodle in Berlin]]'', Sennett's highest-budget film up to that point, and a bit of [[World War I]] propaganda.  This release was parallel to Eltinge's own anti-German film ''Over the Rhine'', (which was re-cut into ''[[The Isle of Love]]'' three years later).

The same year Browne appeared as the headliner at the [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theater in New York]], the single most sought-after booking in American vaudeville, in December 1919,&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Vaudeville, Anthony Slide, page 69&lt;/ref&gt; supported on stage by the [[Sennett Bathing Beauties]].  This appears to be the pinnacle of his career.  He thereafter retired to teach dancing classes in San Francisco, and died in Los Angeles.

'''Gilbert M. "Broncho Billy" Anderson''' (March 21, 1880 – January 20, 1971) was an American actor, writer, film director, and film producer, who is best known as the first star of the [[Western (genre)|Western]] film genre.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bronco Billy Anderson is Dead at 88|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1971-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a founder and star for [[Essanay]] studios.  In 1958, he received a special [[Academy Award]] for being a pioneer of the movie industry.

==Early life==
Anderson was born '''Maxwell Henry Aronson'''&lt;ref&gt;Essanay Silent Film Museum - AKA Gilbert Maxwell Aronson&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=534#&lt;/ref&gt; the sixth child of Henry and Esther (Ash) Aronson, both natives of New York.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:1880 census Aronson.jpg|Aronson in the United States Federal Census]], [[Pulaski County, Arkansas]], 1880, Enumeration District 143, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=534&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~celebrities/anderson.html&lt;/ref&gt; His family was [[Jewish]], his father's parents having emigrated to the United States from [[Prussia]], and his mother's from the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name=erw&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kehr|first=Dave|title=Sring Films / Actors-Directors; The Actors Who Have Two Faces|pages=|publisher=The New York Times|date=2000-01-16|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30E1FFB3D5E0C758DDDA80894D8404482|accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family moved to [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]] when he was three years old. He lived in Pine Bluff until he was 8, when he moved with his family to [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. When he was 18, he moved to [[New York City]] and appeared in [[vaudeville]] and the theater, supplementing his income as a photographer's model and newspaper vendor. In 1903, he met [[Edwin S. Porter]], who hired him as an actor and occasional script collaborator.&lt;ref&gt;Corneau, Ernest N. ''The Hall of Fame of Western Film Stars''. Christopher Publishing House, 1969, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Ephraim. ''The Film Encyclopedia, 5th Ed.'' New York City: Harper Collins, 2005. pp. 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
Anderson played three roles in Porter's early [[film|motion picture]] ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903). Seeing the film for the first time at a vaudeville theater and being overwhelmed by the audience's reaction, he decided to work in the film industry exclusively. He began to write, direct, and act in his own westerns under the name Gilbert M. Anderson.
[[File:Bushman chaplin Anderson.jpg|thumb|left|[[Francis X. Bushman]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] and Anderson, photo taken at the Essanay Studio, Chicago in 1915]]
In 1907 in [[Chicago]], Anderson and [[George Kirke Spoor]] founded [[Essanay Studios]] ("S and A" for Spoor and Anderson), one of the major early [[movie studio]]s. In 1909, he directed the film with the first known instance of the pie-the-face gag, ''[[Mr. Flip]]''. Anderson acted in over 300 short films. He played a wide variety of characters, but he gained enormous popularity from a series of 148 [[silent film|silent]] western shorts and was the first film cowboy star, "Broncho Billy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kiehn, David.|year=2003|title=Broncho Billy and the Essanay Film Company|publisher=Farwell Books|location=Berkeley, Calif|isbn=0-9729226-5-2}}, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Spoor stayed in Chicago running the company like a factory, while Anderson traveled the western United States by train with a film crew shooting movies.  Many of these were shot in [[Fremont, California#Niles|Niles]], a small town in [[Alameda County, California]], south-east of San Francisco, where the nearby [[Western Pacific Railroad]] route through [[Niles Canyon]] proved to be a very suitable location for the filming of Westerns.

Writing, acting, and directing most of these movies, Anderson also found time to direct a series of "Alkali Ike" comedy westerns starring [[Augustus Carney]]. In 1916, Anderson sold his ownership in Essanay and retired from acting. He returned to [[New York City]], bought the [[Longacre Theatre]] and produced plays, but without permanent success. He then made a brief comeback as a producer with a series of shorts with [[Stan Laurel]], including his first work with [[Oliver Hardy]] in ''[[A Lucky Dog]]'' (filmed in 1919, released in 1921). Conflicts with the studio, Metro, led him to retire again after 1920.

Anderson sued [[Paramount Pictures]] for naming a character "Bronco Billy" in ''[[Star Spangled Rhythm]]'' (1943) and for depicting the character as a "washed-up and broken-down actor," which he felt reflected badly on him.  He asked for $900,000, but the outcome of the suit is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{tcmdb title|91295|Star Spangled Rhythm ("Notes")}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson resumed producing movies, as owner of Progressive Pictures, into the 1950s, then retired again. In 1958, he received an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] as a "motion picture pioneer" for his "contributions to the development of motion pictures as entertainment."

At age 85, Anderson came out of retirement for a cameo role in ''The Bounty Killer'' (1965). For the last years of his life, he lived at the [[Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]], California.&lt;ref&gt;Corneau, Ernest N. ''The Hall of Fame of Western Film Stars''. Christopher Publishing House, 1969, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Anderson died in 1971 at the age of 90, at a [[sanatorium|sanitarium]] in [[South Pasadena, California|South Pasadena]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times, January 21, 1971, Section 1, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his wife, Mollie Louise (Schabbleman) Anderson, their daughter, Maxine, and his sister [[Leona Anderson]] (1884–1973). He was cremated and his ashes placed in a vault at the [[Chapel of the Pines Crematory]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].

==Legacy==
Anderson was honored posthumously in 1998 with his image on a [[List of people on stamps of the United States|U.S. postage stamp]]. In 2002, he was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]]. For the past nine years, [[Niles, California|Niles]] (now part of [[Fremont, California|Fremont]]), California, site of the western Essanay Studios, has held an annual "Broncho Billy Silent Film Festival."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nilesfilmmuseum.org/bb_festival.htm Broncho Billy Silent Film Festival] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616023319/http://www.nilesfilmmuseum.org/bb_festival.htm |date=June 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson has a [[List of actors with Hollywood Walk of Fame motion picture stars|motion pictures star]] on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1651 Vine Street in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodchamber.net/ Hollywood Chamber of Commerce]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Chicago Park District park, not far from the site of the Chicago Essanay Studio lot, was named Broncho Billy Park in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks/Broncho-Billy-Playlot-Park/]&lt;/ref&gt;

March 21, 2018, a historical roadside marker was dedicated in Little Rock, Arkansas, across the street from his birthplace, 713 Center Street.  The marker was donated by the [[Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation]] in cooperation with the [[Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum]] and [[First United Methodist Church (Little Rock, Arkansas)]].

The '''Buenos Aires Philharmonic''' is an Argentinian orchestra based in [[Buenos Aires]]. Founded in 1946, it is based in the renowned [[Teatro Colón]], and is considered one of the most prestigious orchestras in its nation and Latin America, and has received several honours in 60 years of history. Their local counterparts in the national aegis are the [[Argentine National Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Teatro Colón]] Orchestra. The orchestra's current Music Director is Mexican [[Enrique Diemecke]].

==History==

The Buenos Aires Philharmonic was created in 1946 with the name ''Orquesta Sinfónica del Teatro Municipal'', offering its first concert on May 21, 1947. Its first official conductor was [[Lamberto Baldi]]; years later, the position was taken over by [[Jaime Pahissa]]. In 1948 the orchestra changed its name to the Symphony orchestra of the city of Buenos Aires; this same year, celebrated conductor [[Herbert von Karajan]] conducted the orquestra on two occasions. In 1953 the orchestra moved to its permanent residence in the Colón Theatre and in 1958 adopted its current name.

During the following decades, the orchestra reached international prestige, performing with well-known national and international soloists. These included such pianists as [[Alfred Brendel]], [[Martha Argerich]], [[Lazar Berman]], [[Alfred Cortot]], [[Byron Janis]], [[Rudolf Firkusny]], [[Andor Foldes]], [[Ivo Pogorelich]], [[Nelson Freire]], [[Bruno Leonardo Gelber]], [[Arthur Rubinstein]], [[Jean-Yves Thibaudet]], [[Rubén González (pianist)|Rubén González]], [[Barry Douglas (musician)|Barry Douglas]], [[Nelson Goerner]], [[Peter Donohoe (pianist)|Peter Donohoe]], [[Friedrich Gulda]], [[Rudolf Buchbinder]], [[Andras Schiff]] y [[Manuel Rego]]. Violinist included [[Gidon Kremer]], [[David Oistrakh]], [[Joshua Bell]], [[Shlomo Mintz]], [[Alberto Lysy]], [[Ruggiero Ricci]], [[Yehudi Menuhin]], [[Itzhak Perlman]], [[Midori Gotō|Midori]], [[Gil Shaham]], [[Jacques Singer]], [[Henryk Szeryng]], [[Salvatore Accardo]], [[Leonid Kogan]], [[Cho-Liang Lin]] and [[Uto Ughi]]. Cellists included [[Pablo Casals]], [[Mstislav Rostropovich]], [[Mischa Maisky]], [[André Navarra]], [[Natalie Clein]], [[Sol Gabetta]], [[Arto Noras]] and [[Yo-Yo Ma]]; Vocalists included [[Marian Anderson]], [[José Carreras]], [[Régine Crespin]], [[Plácido Domingo]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Samuel Ramey]], [[Jose Van Dam]] and [[Frederica von Stade]]; Guitarists included [[Paco de Lucía]] and [[Narciso Yepes]]. The orchestra also played with harpist [[Nicanor Zabaleta]], clarinetist [[Wenzel Fuchs]], horn player [[Radovan Vlatkovic]], flutist [[Sharon Bezaly]] and bandoneonist [[Ástor Piazzolla]], among others.

Among the conductors that have worked with the orchestra, including already cited [[Herbert von Karajan]], are [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]], [[Sergiu Celibidache]], Sir [[Georg Solti]], Sir [[Thomas Beecham]], [[Charles Dutoit]], [[Lorin Maazel]], [[Zubin Mehta]], [[Rudolf Kempe]], [[Clemens Krauss]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Malcolm Sargent]], [[Antal Doráti]], [[Ernest Ansermet]], [[Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos]], [[Eduardo Mata]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Karl Richter (conductor)|Karl Richter]], [[Luis Antonio García Navarro]], [[Mikhail Jurowski]], [[José Serebrier]], [[Michel Corboz]], [[Robert Spano]], [[Leopold Hager]], [[Ferdinand Leitner]], [[Peter Maag]], [[Igor Markevich]], [[Stanislaw Wislocki]], [[Jean Fournet]], [[Franz-Paul Decker]], [[Eiji Oue]], [[David Lloyd-Jones (conductor)|David Lloyd-Jones]], [[Yuri Simonov]], [[Moshe Atzmon]], [[Serge Baudo]], [[Steuart Bedford]], and [[Christof Escher]], among others. Regarding Argentine conductors, some of the most noteworthy are [[Daniel Barenboim]], [[Pedro Ignacio Calderón]], [[Juan José Castro]] and [[Simón Blech]]. The orchestra maintains a strong collaboration with conductor [[Charles Dutoit]], whom they have performed with recently.

Currently, the orchestra is conducted by Mexican conductor [[Enrique Diemecke]]. Maestro Diemecke has had earlier success conducting celebrated orchestras, such as the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] of London, the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Orchestre National de France]] and the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]].

==Tours==

The Buenos Aires Philharmonic has had three successful tours of special relevance: in 1992, 1994 and 1996. These tours have included stops in Germany, England, Spain, France, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium and Austria, and has performed in such prestigious venues as the [[Berliner Philharmonie]], the [[Barbican Centre]] in London (one of the most famous cultural centers in Europe, also home to the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]), and the [[Concertgebouw]] of [[Amsterdam]] (home to the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] of Amsterdam). The orchestra frequently tours nationally and in the surrounding countries of [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], and [[Uruguay]].

{{Culture of Turkey}}
'''Yeşilçam''' (literally means ''The Green Pine'' in Turkish language) ({{IPA-tr|ˈje.ʃil.t͡ʃɑm|Pronounced as}}) is the [[sobriquet]] that refers to the Turkish film art and industry. It is an important part of [[Turkish culture]], and has flourished over the years, delivering entertainment to audiences in [[Turkey]], expatriates across [[Europe]], and more recently prospering in the [[Arab world]] and in rare cases, the [[United States of America|United States]]. The first film exhibited in the [[Ottoman Empire]] was the [[Lumière Brothers]]' 1895 film, ''[[L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat]]'', which was shown in [[Istanbul]] in 1896. The first Turkish-made film was a documentary entitled ''[[Ayastefanos'taki Rus Abidesinin Yıkılışı]]'' (''Demolition of the Russian Monument at [[Yeşilköy|San Stefano]]''), directed by [[Fuat Uzkınay]] and completed in 1914. The first narrative film, [[Sedat Simavi]]'s ''[[The Spy (1917 film)|The Spy]]'', was released in 1917. Turkey's first sound film was shown in 1931.

==History==

===Overview===
In terms of film production, Turkey shared the same fate with many of the national cinemas of the 20th century. Film production wasn't continuous until around the 1950s and the film market in general was run by a few major import companies that struggled for domination in the most population-dense and profitable cities such as Istanbul and [[İzmir]]. Film theatres rarely ever screened any locally produced films and the majority of the programs consisted of films of the stronger western film industries, especially those of the United States, France, Italy and Germany. Attempts at film production came primarily from multinational studios, which could rely on their comprehensive distribution networks together with their own theatre chains, thus guaranteeing them a return on their investment. Between the years 1896–1945, the number of locally produced films did not even reach 50 films in total, equal to less than a single year's annual film production in the 1950s and 1960s. Domestically produced films constituted only a small fraction of the total number of films screened in Turkey prior to the 1950s.

Film production in Turkey increased drastically after [[World War II]]. With a total of 49 films produced in 1952, this single year equaled a greater output produced in Turkey than all previous years combined. During the 1960s, Turkey became the fifth biggest film producer worldwide as annual film production reached the 300 film benchmark just at the beginning of the 1970s. Compared to other national cinemas, the achievements of the Turkish film industry after 1950 are still remarkable.

During the 1970s, the impact of TV and video as the new popular forms of media and political turmoil (often hand in hand with deep economic crises) caused a sharp drop in ticket sales, resulting in a steady decline starting around 1980 and continuing until the mid-1990s. The number of annual ticket sales decreased from a peak of 90 million tickets in 1966&lt;ref name="Nijat 1966"&gt;Özön, Nijat (1966) ''Türk Sineması Kronolojisi 1896–1966''. Istanbul: Bilgi Yayınları.&lt;/ref&gt; to 56 million tickets in 1984 and only 11 million in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;T.C. Devlet Istatistik Enstitüsü Eğlence İstatistikleri.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the number of film theatres declined from approximately 2,000 in 1966&lt;ref name="Nijat 1966"/&gt; to 854 in 1984 and 290 in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;T.C. Devlet İstatistik Enstitüsü Eğlence İstatistikleri.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s the average number of films produced per year remained between 10-15; usually half of them not even making it into the theatres.

Since 1995 the situation has improved. After the year 2000, annual ticket sales rose to 20 million and since 1995, the number of theatres has steadily increased to approximately 500 nationwide. Currently, Turkish films attract audiences of millions of viewers and routinely top the blockbuster lists, often surpassing foreign films at the box office. However, it is difficult to speak about the existence of an industry, since most films are rather individual projects of directors who otherwise earn their living in television, advertising or theatre. The distribution of these films are mainly handled by multinational corporations such as [[Warner Bros.]] and [[United International Pictures]].

===Pre-1950s===
Most of the Turkish films produced before 1950 were projects initiated by import companies owned by local families, most notably [[İpek Film]], a daughter company of the İpek Merchandise, an import company that was advertising in Ottoman literary journals such as ''[[Servet-i Fünun]]'' as early as the 19th century. Another important company in the early era of Turkish cinema was [[Kemal Film]], a company whose continuous presence as a leading import company has been often overlooked for a few local films it produced during the 1920s. (The founders of Kemal Film bought their first film camera on loan from the Ipek Merchandise). Both companies were the strongest film distributors until the 1950s and the only companies that were financially sound enough to produce films themselves, with low risks for financial failure as they already were in possession of a distribution system and theatre chains that guaranteed a return on investment.

However, the notable developments of these companies must be seen as necessary adaptations to the technological progress of the western film industries whose films they were importing. One example here being the establishment of the [[Marmara Dubbing Studio]] in the early 1930s, when the silent era came to an end in the West and sound films became the standard, prompting the import-dependent companies to adjust themselves to the new technological requirements.

The big distributors in Istanbul, led by İpek Film and [[Kemal Film]], gradually expanded their distribution system throughout the rest of the country during the 1930s, leading to the so-called "regional system" ([[Bölge İşletmeleri]]), which consisted of seven distribution areas headquartered in the most significant cities in those regions: Istanbul (Marmara Region), İzmir (Aegaean Region), [[Ankara]] (Middle Anatolian Region), [[Samsun]] (Black Sea Region), [[Adana]] (Mediterranean Region), [[Erzurum]] (East Anatolian Region) and [[Diyarbakır]] (South East Anatolian Region).&lt;ref name="Abisel, Nilgün 1987"&gt;Abisel, Nilgün (1987) "Yerli Yapımcılık Üzerine Notlar", ''Türk Sineması Üzerine Yazılar'', Ankara: İmge Yayınları.&lt;/ref&gt; The Regional System became much more important after the 1950s, when local film production dramatically increased and local films surpassed imported films in both ticket sales and revenues. This system became the financial foundation of [[Yeşilçam]] (often referred to as "Turkish Hollywood"), which was the heart of Turkish film production between the years 1955–1975. After 1965, a so-called "Combined System" ([[Kombine Sistem]]) led by a trust of regional leaders is said to have taken control of almost everything regarding production.&lt;ref name="Abisel, Nilgün 1987"/&gt; A leading figure of the trust was producer [[Türker İnanoğlu]], who is still active in the media business today, now running [[Ulusal Film]], Turkey's largest TV production company.

The first [[film]] showing in [[Turkey]] was held in the [[Yıldız Palace]], [[Istanbul]] in 1896. Public shows by [[Sigmund Weinberg]] in the [[Beyoğlu]] and [[Şehzadebaşı]] districts followed in 1897. Weinberg was already a prominent figure at that time, especially known as a representative of foreign companies such as [[Pathé]], for whom he sold [[phonograph|gramophones]] before getting into the film business. Some sources suggest he was also a photographer, again as a result of being one of the representatives of foreign companies such as [[Kodak]].

The first Turkish movie, ''Ayastefanos′taki Rus Abidesinin Yıkılışı'', a [[documentary film|documentary]] produced by [[Fuat Uzkınay]] in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinematurk.com/film/1915-ayastefanostaki-rus-abidesinin-yikilisi/|title=Ayastefanos'taki Rus Abidesinin Yıkılışı ~ Sinematurk.com|first=Xhtml|last=Kitchen|date=|website=www.sinematurk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; depicted the destruction of a Russian monument erected at the end of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|1877-1878 Russo-Turkish War]] in [[Yeşilköy]] (then known as "San Stefano") following Turkey's entry into [[World War I]]. The first thematic Turkish films were ''The Marriage of Himmet Aga'' (1916–1918), started by Weinberg and completed by Uzkinay, and ''The Paw'' (1917) and ''[[The Spy (1917 film)|The Spy]]'' (1917), both by [[Sedat Simavi]]. The army-affiliated Central Cinema Directorate, a semi-military national defense society, and the Disabled Veterans Society were the producing organizations of that period.

In 1922, a major documentary film, ''[[Independence, the İzmir Victory]]'', was made about the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. That same year, the first private movie studio, Kemal Film, commenced operations. From 1923 to 1939, [[Muhsin Ertugrul]] was the only active film director in the country. He directed 29 films during this period, generally incorporating adaptions of plays, [[operetta]]s, fiction and foreign films. The influence of the theater dating back to Uzkinay, Simavi, [[Ahmet Fehim]] and Şadi Karagozoglu is very strong in Ertugrul's work.

The years between 1939 and 1950 were a period of transition for Turkish cinema, during which it was greatly influenced by theater as well as by World War II. While there were only two film companies in 1939, the number increased to four between 1946 and 1950. After 1949, Turkish cinema was able to develop as a separate art form, with a more professional caliber of talents.

===The Yeşilçam era===

'''Yeşilçam''' ("Green Pine") is a [[metonym]] for the Turkish film industry, similar to [[Hollywood]] in the United States. Yeşilçam is named after Yeşilçam Street in the [[Beyoğlu]] district of [[Istanbul]] where many actors, directors, crew members and studios were based.

Yeşilçam experienced its heyday from the 1950s to the 1970s, when it produced 250 to 350 films annually. Between 1950 and 1966 more than fifty movie directors practiced film arts in Turkey. [[Ömer Lütfi Akad]] strongly influenced the period, but [[Osman Fahir Seden]], [[Atıf Yılmaz]], and [[Memduh Ün]] made the most films. The film ''[[Susuz Yaz]]'' (''Dry Summer''), made by [[Metin Erksan]], won the [[Golden Bear|Golden Bear Award]] at the [[Berlin Film Festival]] in 1964.

The number of cinemagoers and the number of films made constantly increased, especially after 1958. In the 1960s the programs of the theater departments in the Language, History and Geography faculties of [[Ankara University]] and [[Istanbul University]] included cinema courses, as did the Press and Publications High School of Ankara University. A cinema branch was also established in the Art History Department of the [[State Fine Arts Academy]].

The Union of Turkish Film Producers and the State Film Archives both date from  the 1960s. The State Film Archives became the Turkish Film Archives in 1969. During the same period, the Cinema-TV Institute was founded and annexed to the [[State Academy of Fine Arts]]. The Turkish State Archives also became part of this organization. In 1962, the Cinema-TV Institute became a department of [[Mimar Sinan University]]. Well-known directors of the 1960–1970 period include Metin Erksan, Atıf Yılmaz, Memduh Ün, [[Halit Refiğ]], [[Duygu Sağıroğlu]], [[Remzi Aydın Jöntürk]] and [[Nevzat Pesen]]. In 1970, the numbers of cinemas and cinemagoers rose spectacularly. In the 2,424 cinemas around the county, films were viewed by a record number of 247 million viewers.

In 1970, approximately 220 films were made and this figure reached 300 in 1972. Turkish cinema gave birth to its legendary stars during this period, notable examples being [[Kemal Sunal]], [[Kadir İnanır]], [[Türkan Şoray]] and [[Şener Şen]]. After this period, however, the cinema began to lose its audiences, due to nationwide TV broadcasts. After 1970, a new and younger generation of directors emerged, but they had to cope with an increased demand for video films after 1980.

Yeşilçam suffered due to the spread of [[television]] and the [[Political violence in Turkey (1976–80)|widespread political violence]] at the end of the 1970s. Yeşilçam totally ended after the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état]]. However, Yeşilçam has seen a revival since 2002, having produced critically acclaimed movies such as ''[[Uzak]]'' ([[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]] [[2003 Cannes Film Festival|(Cannes Film Festival), 2003]]), ''[[My Father and My Son|Babam ve Oğlum]]'' (''My Father and My Son'') and ''[[Propaganda (film)|Propaganda]]''.

===Decline of Yeşilçam and the post-Yeşilçam era===
{{update section|date=June 2016}}
Increased production costs and difficulties in the import of raw materials brought about a decrease in the number of films made in the 1970s, but the quality of films improved.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} In the early nineties, there were barely two or three movies released per year. During this period, most of the seventies' stars had either moved to TV, or were trying to rebuild the ''[[Yeşilçam]]'s'' former glory. Some of the notable examples of this era are ''[[Eşkıya]]'' (''The Bandit'') and ''Züğürt Ağa'' (''The Agha''), both starring [[Şener Şen]]. Both movies were critically and commercially acclaimed.

However, the resurgence of Yesilçam didn't truly take place until the release of ''[[Vizontele]]'' in 2001. The film was directed, written, and starred by [[Yılmaz Erdoğan]], who was already well-known from his long-running sitcom ''Bir Demet Tiyatro'', and his dedication to theatre. The movie starred the cast of his usual plays, most notably [[Demet Akbağ]], [[Altan Erkekli]], and [[Cem Yılmaz]]. This movie's huge commercial success (watched by 2.5 million viewers, which earned the movie the most viewed film for its day) brought attention to the industry. A few years later, Cem Yılmaz released his own film, ''[[G.O.R.A.]]'', which he both wrote and starred in. This, and Vizontele's sequel ''[[Vizontele Tuuba]]'', broke ''Vizontele'''s records by achieving 3.5 million and 3 million viewers, respectively.

Since then, larger-budgeted films have been produced, including notable examples such as ''[[Kurtlar Vadisi: Irak]]'' (''Valley of the Wolves: Iraq''), which was viewed by a record 4 million people, ''[[My Father and My Son|Babam ve Oğlum]]'' (''My Father and My Son''), and Cem Yılmaz's second movie ''[[The Magician (2006 film)|Hokkabaz]]'' (''The Magician'') .

There has been a rise in experimental films in the 2000s. These include the 2005 feature ''Türev'', which was filmed without a prewritten script and even featured candid shots of the actors, and ''[[Istanbul Tales|Anlat Istanbul]]'' (''Istanbul Tales''), an ensemble piece divided into five "mini films" that received a strong reception.

''"Körler / Jaluziler İçin''" is the first internationally awarded Turkish science fiction feature film which is not a comedy, a cult film, a remake or an animation which marks its unique place as a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema. It was written, directed, produced and edited by Ozan Duru Adam. The film invents an innovative, unconventional visual language.

Production numbers also soared in the second half of the 2000s, reaching 40 films in 2007, with the top four box office hits that year claimed by Turkish films, as the film industry became profitable again with improving technical quality corresponding with commercial films' production costs increasing.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2015, number of admission per capita was 0.8. Also [[Sinemia]] has published a research that Konya has become the city with the most frequent cinema goers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milliyet.com.tr/en-az-sinemaya-giden-samsun-gundem-2272869/ "En az sinemaya giden: Samsun"]. Report by: [[Sinemia]], Published in: Milliyet, 04 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
Although the need for a cinema law has been frequently debated throughout the history of the Turkish Republic, until 1986 no specific law or regulation had been developed. While films have generally been treated as goods subject to laws regarding taxation, content-wise they were controlled by commissions that have been often criticized for being mechanisms of censorship.

In the 1930s, some members of the parliament raised the issue of whether films would have a bad impact on children. This was a popular theme at that time, not just in Turkey, but also in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Later, in the 1960s, a debate around the so-called "Baykam Law" became quite famous for the tension it created amongst the parliamentarians and the stakeholders in the industry. In 1977 and 1978, further discussions for a cinema law have been held, but without any result.

Finally, in 1986, a cinema law, though highly criticised by members of the industry and the cinema intelligentsia of that time, was passed by the parliament and has since been the fundamental legislative document regarding cinema issues in Turkey. The new law aimed to ensure support for those working in cinema and [[music]]. A reorganization of the film industry began in 1987 to address problems and assure its development. The Ministry of Culture established the "Professional Union of Owners of Turkish Works of Cinema" the same year.

The "Copyrights and General Directorate of Cinema" was founded in 1989 as well as a "Support Fund for the Cinema and Musical Arts". This fund is used to provide financial support to the film sector.

===Rating systems and censorship===
One of the most interesting studies on the issue of film censorship in Turkey is [[Alim Şerif Onaran]]'s ''Sinematografik Hürriyet'' (''Cinematic Freedom''), published in 1968 by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, but written in 1963 and being the first study in Turkey which received a PhD for a topic related to film. This study is still the most important -if not only- study on the film evaluation methods applied in Turkey before the 1950s. Onaran himself being active as a member of the Film Rating Commission in his younger years, was a true expert on the topic, and his research also includes examples of the late Ottoman Period. Ironically, Onaran became one of the most important intellectuals on film in Turkey, owing his wealth of knowledge on early world film history to the years he spent watching the films he was enrolled to evaluate as a committee member.

A very interesting example on the level of absurdity that censorship could reach is mentioned in Çetin Yetkin's book ''Siyasal Iktidar Sanata Karşı'' (''Political Regime vs Art''), published in 1970. It tells the story of a film which was classified as "inappropriate for export" because the Evaluation Committee decided that the film contains "communist propaganda". The film-owner, who applied to the committee for an export certificate, was surprised to see the decision because he mentioned on his application form that his intention was to sell a copy of the film to a distributor in the Soviet Union, the world's leading communist country at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Yetkin, Çetin (1970) ''Siyasal İktidar Sanata Karşı'', Ankara: Bilgi Yayınları.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comics Fest India''' (previously known as Nagraj Janmotsav) was a [[Comic book convention|comic-based convention]] held in [[India]], annually at [[New Delhi]].

The event began as an annual birthday celebration for [[Nagraj]]. But the incereasing number of fans and participants made the event grow larger every year, and soon the event sprang out of the Raj Comics studios (where it started) and was held at [[Dilli Haat]], [[Pitampura]].

The event is popular for being the only convention in India that provides free gifts (including T-shirts, comic books and merchandise) to all the registered attendees. Now it is the second annual comic book convention in New Delhi, after [[Comic Con India]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Comics Fest India Slated for 30 Nov &amp; 1 Dec|url=http://www.animationxpress.com/index.php/latest-news/comic-fest-india-2013-slated-for-30-nov-and-1-dec|accessdate=26 November 2013|newspaper=Animation Xpress|date=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Grand Celebration of Indian Comics|url=http://www.cgtantra.com/forums/showthread.php?t=35107|work=CG Tantra|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2008, [[Raj Comics]] hosted 3 events namely, ''Gen-Next Writers Workshop'' (January 2008), ''Junoon Mela'' (June 2008), and ''Nagraj Janmotsav'' (4–5 October 2008). Nagraj Janmotsav was the birthday celebration of Raj Comics's flagship character Nagraj.

[[File:Nagraj Janmotsav 2012.jpg|thumb|(From left-right) Manish Gupta, [[Sanjay Gupta (comics)|Sanjay Gupta]] and Manoj Gupta with the host Kshitij Sharma at Nagraj Janmotsav, 2012.]]
What started as a birthday celebration for their flagship character, soon grew into an annual convention attended by several fans and creators. Raj Comics organized the initial events at Rtoonz Studios ([[Burari]]). Each year, the event kept growing both in size and space and in 2012, it was held at Dilli Haat, Pitampura.&lt;ref name=ht&gt;[http://in.groups.yahoo.com/group/jistmca/message/4141] ''[[Yahoo]]'', New Delhi, 5 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Raj Comics declared that Nagraj Janmotsav will be celebrated on an even bigger scale and was called ''Comics Fest India''. This new bigger convention showcased stalls by multiple Indian publishing houses, including, but not restricted to, [[Raj Comics]], Tricolor Children Books, [[Campfire Novels]], [[Holycow Entertainment]], Paperclip Books, [[Rovolt Comics]], [[Fenil Comics]] and many other publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nagraj Janmotsav and 2nd Annual Kalpana Lok Awards 2011|work=All Events|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These conventions include many contests, interactive sessions, comics launches, workshops and speeches by various novelists, editors, comic book artists and writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nagraj Jamotsav - 5|year=2012|publisher=Freelance Talents|location=Meerut|page=12|url=http://www.readwhere.com/publication/1672/Indian-Comics-Fandom-Vol.-1/vol/61742}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comics Event at Dilli Haat|url=https://eventviva.com/event/257660414355526|work=Event Viva|publisher=Dilli Haat|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Raj Comics celebrated its Silver Jubilee with the third Nagraj Janmotsav.

'''''Cortex Command''''' is a [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[action game]] developed by Swedish studio Data Realms since 2001.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Cortex Command video game screenshot.png|thumb|left|''Cortex Command'' screenshot.]]
The player takes the role of a stationary or mobile "brain", which can take control of other purchased units in order to accomplish objectives. Missions range from tasks such as retrieving a control chip in a cave filled with zombies to defending the brain from attack.  As the brain is weak, the player must manage his resources carefully, protecting the brain, mining gold and fighting off enemies.

The game includes the ability for players to create [[mod (computer gaming)|mods]] (additions and changes to the game) with the built in [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] programming applet and simple scripting.

== Development ==
The [[game engine]] was designed and built by Dan Tabár, using several [[open-source software|open-source]] [[library (computing)|libraries]]. The [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] was built by Jason Boettcher, the artwork is by Arne Niklas Jansson, and the [[macOS]] port is by Chris Kruger,&lt;ref name="cc_home" /&gt;&lt;ref name="play"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Griffin | first = Mike | title = Cortex Command: Brain slayers in outer space | newspaper = [[Play (US magazine)|Play]] | pages = 64–65 | date = June 2008 | url =| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Linux port was developed by Jesus Higueras.

The game was first released as an [[open beta]] and was later released for purchase with a time-limited [[game demo|demo]] version available as well.

As of May 2008, the game was described as being in development for approximately seven years, with Dan Tabár quitting his job in mid-2006 to work full-time on the project.&lt;ref name="indiegames" /&gt; No versions for game consoles are planned.&lt;ref name="indiegames" /&gt; The game allows several components to be modified using [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] and [[INI file|INI]] files, such as Scenes (or levels), Actors, Weapons, and more.&lt;ref name="indiegames"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2008/05/interview_dan_tabar_cortex_com.html | title = Interview: Dan Tabár (Cortex Command)| author = W., Tim| publisher =indiegames.com | date = 2008-05-27| accessdate= 2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influences for the game include the ''[[X-COM: UFO Defense]]'' series.&lt;ref name="play" /&gt; {{asof|2009}}, the full version is still being refined (as the game is still in extensive development), but includes unlimited play and extra features unavailable in the demo.&lt;ref name="cc_home"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cortex Command |url=http://www.datarealms.com/games.php |author= |publisher=Data Realms LLC |date= |accessdate=2008-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Despite the fact that the main story has been scrapped as of now, Cortex Command does have some background lore. Sometime in the mid-to-far future after humanity suffered a war brought on by a certain religious group, "a curious symbiosis" between man and machine was formed. This eventually led to humans becoming advanced enough to ditch their bodies and take their brains anywhere. This in turn, led to space travel finally becoming feasible since aging is either non-existent or slowed down to a very slow state. This leads to humans making contact with alien life forms, in a desperate attempt for humans to fit in, they establish TradeStar. TradeStar is one of the biggest if not the biggest corporations in the whole Milky Way galaxy. But humanity doesn't stop there, despite humanity having long abandoned their bodies, they still kept the stubborn will to fight.

'''Dawn Therese Brancheau''' ([[née]] '''LoVerde''', April 16, 1969&amp;nbsp;– February 24, 2010) was an American senior animal trainer at [[SeaWorld]].&lt;ref name=Cridlin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zimmerman-TKitP/&gt; She worked with [[orca]]s at [[SeaWorld Orlando]] for fifteen years, including a leading role in revamping the ''[[Shamu (SeaWorld show)|Shamu]]'' show,&lt;ref name=Cridlin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kassab20060109/&gt; and was SeaWorld's [[Poster child|poster girl]].&lt;ref name=Zimmerman-TKitP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hargrove/&gt;&lt;ref name=Believe20130514/&gt; She was killed by an orca, [[Tilikum (orca)|Tilikum]],&lt;ref name=OSHRC/&gt; becoming the only SeaWorld trainer to be killed by an animal. However, her death was the third fatality associated with Tilikum, and many other trainers have been seriously injured by orcas.&lt;ref name=OSHRC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stetz20100421/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoyt1992/&gt;

== Life and career ==
Brancheau was born Dawn Therese LoVerde in [[Cedar Lake, Indiana]] and was the youngest of six children.&lt;ref name=Obituary/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jacobson/&gt; She had a passionate love of animals&lt;ref name=Kirby-DaSW/&gt; and set her heart on becoming a ''[[Shamu]]'' trainer during a family vacation to [[Orlando]].&lt;ref name=Zimmerman-TKitP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kassab20060109/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jacobson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirby-DaSW/&gt; She graduated from the [[University of South Carolina]] with degrees in [[psychology]] and [[animal behavior]].&lt;ref name=Jacobson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirby-DaSW/&gt; Away from work, she volunteered at a local animal shelter,&lt;ref name=Zimmerman-TKitP/&gt; looked after two chocolate [[Labrador]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawnsfoundation.org/dawn-s-story.html|title=The Dawn Brancheau Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and kept a variety of stray ducks, chickens, rabbits, and small birds at her home.&lt;ref name=Zimmerman-TKitP/&gt;

[[File:Katina &amp; Dawn.jpg|thumb|Brancheau on a slide out, which is a platform covered by less than a foot of water, with killer whale ''Katina'' in SeaWorld Orlando]]
Brancheau spent two years working with [[dolphin]]s at [[Six Flags Great Adventure]] in [[New Jersey]] before beginning her career at [[SeaWorld Orlando]] in 1994, initially working with [[otter]]s and [[sea lion]]s.&lt;ref name=Zimmerman-TKitP/&gt;{{rp|347}}&lt;ref name=Kassab20060109/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jacobson/&gt; In 1996, the same year she married Scott Brancheau,&lt;ref name=Kirby-DaSW/&gt; a SeaWorld stunt [[water skier]],&lt;ref name=Zimmerman-TKitP/&gt; she started working with orcas.&lt;ref name=Zimmerman-TKitP/&gt;{{rp|347}}&lt;ref name=Kassab20060109/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jacobson/&gt;

In 2000, she appeared on [[NBC]] affiliate [[WESH]] and talked about staying physically fit in order to deal with the intense rigor of working with killer whales.&lt;ref name=WESH13533140/&gt; She ran marathons, cycled, and lifted weights to stay in good shape. In 2006, her decade of work with orcas was profiled, including her leadership role in a two- to three-year revamp of the ''[[Shamu (SeaWorld show)|Shamu]]'' show.&lt;ref name=Cridlin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kassab20060109/&gt; Brancheau acknowledged the dangers of working in close proximity to orcas.&lt;ref name=Kassab20060109/&gt; As a senior trainer, she appeared in various SeaWorld public performances for many years.&lt;ref name=Cridlin/&gt;&lt;ref name=WESH13533140/&gt; The Shamu show's interaction of animal trainers with orcas was regarded as SeaWorld's star attraction.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;

She was featured on SeaWorld [[billboard]]s throughout Orlando.&lt;ref name=Zimmerman-TKitP/&gt; Judge [[Brett Kavanaugh]], a dissenting judge in a legal case involving her death ([[#Safety|see below]]), stated that "To be fearless, courageous, tough – to perform a sport or activity at the highest levels of human capacity, even in the face of known physical risk – is among the greatest forms of personal achievement for many who take part in these activities."&lt;ref name=USCA121375/&gt;{{rp|24}}

== Death ==
On February 24, 2010, Brancheau performed a ''Dine with Shamu'' show with [[Tilikum (orca)|Tilikum]],&lt;ref name=Hoare/&gt; the largest orca at [[SeaWorld Orlando]]. In this setting, guests ate at an open-air restaurant while watching the performance poolside as the orca was exercised and fed.&lt;ref name=OSHRC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirby-DaSW/&gt; As part of the end-of-show routine, she was at the edge of the pool, rubbing Tilikum's head. She was lying with her face next to Tilikum's on a slide-out, which is a platform submerged about a foot into the water. Sources stated that she was pulled into the water by her ponytail;&lt;ref name=CNN20100224/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pilkington20100225/&gt;&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt; the orca's move seems to have been very quick, pulling her underwater and drowning her.&lt;ref name=Pilkington20100225/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor20100429/&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT20100224/&gt; At least a dozen patrons witnessed Brancheau in the water with Tilikum. Employees used nets and threw food at Tilikum in an attempt to distract him.&lt;ref name=Zimmerman-TKitP/&gt; Moving from pool to pool in the complex, they eventually directed Tilikum to a smaller, medical pool, where it would be easier to calm him. The orca subsequently released Brancheau's body.

The autopsy report said that Brancheau died from drowning and blunt force trauma. Her spinal cord was severed, and she had sustained fractures to her [[mandible|jawbone]], ribs, and a [[cervical vertebra]]. Her scalp was completely torn off from her head, her left arm had been ripped off near the shoulder, and her left elbow and left knee had been dislocated.&lt;ref name=Autopsy-DB/&gt;

Brancheau was buried at [[Holy Sepulchre Cemetery (Worth, Illinois)|Holy Sepulchre Cemetery]] in [[Worth Township, Cook County, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Funeral-Services-Set-for-SeaWorld-Trainer-85815077.html NBC Chicago]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==
===Safety===
No SeaWorld trainer entered a pool to perform a show with an orca following Brancheau's death.&lt;ref name=Hargrove/&gt;{{rp|7}}&lt;ref name=Schneider20110919/&gt; Immediately afterwards, SeaWorld disallowed trainers from being in the water with any orca.&lt;ref name=Hargrove/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee20100224/&gt; This internal, voluntary prohibition was similar to what had happened after some other injuries to animal trainers. Each time, the temporary pause was then lifted by SeaWorld. However, on this occasion, the ban was solidified by an [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) intervention. This led SeaWorld to repeatedly seek the lifting of various aspects of OSHA's citations and rulings until 2014, when it accepted that further attempts to overturn OSHA were not feasible.&lt;ref name=USCA121375/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuo20140411/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee20140820/&gt;

Although Brancheau is the only SeaWorld trainer killed by an animal, her death was the third fatality associated with [[Tilikum (orca)|Tilikum]]&lt;ref name=Zimmerman-TKitP/&gt;&lt;ref name=OSHRC/&gt; and the fourth by a captive orca.&lt;ref name=OSHRC/&gt; Since orcas were first placed in captivity in the 1960s, there have been more than 40 documented [[Killer whale attacks on humans|safety incidents]], with "dozens" of trainers being seriously injured by various orcas.&lt;ref name=Zimmerman-TKitP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hargrove/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stetz20100421/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee20100224/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zimmerman-BitW/&gt; After a 2006 attack,&lt;ref name=Stetz20100421/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=DeCourcey | first=Danielle | title=Sea World Just Took a Blow That Will Change the Controversial Company Forever | website=ATTN: | date=2016-03-17 | url=http://www.attn.com/stories/6647/sea-world-animal-welfare-changes | accessdate=2016-09-10|quote=a trainer named Ken Peters was bitten and pulled under water by a different whale named Kasatka in 2006, four years before Brancheau was killed. The whale pulled him around for 8 minutes until he finally swam to the edge of the pool visibly shaken}}&lt;/ref&gt; an OSHA investigation in 2007 concluded that, "The continuing factors to the incident, in the simplest of terms, is that swimming with captive orcas is inherently dangerous, and if someone hasn't been killed already, it is only a matter of time before it does happen." SeaWorld successfully challenged the report, which OSHA agreed to withdraw.&lt;ref name=Zimmerman-TKitP/&gt;

Additionally, two months before Brancheau's death, another SeaWorld-owned orca, Keto, killed a trainer, [[Death of Alexis Martínez|Alexis Martínez]], at [[Loro Parque]]'s ''Orca Ocean'' in the [[Canary Islands]].&lt;ref name=Zimmerman-BitW&gt;{{cite web | last=Zimmermann | first=Tim | title=Blood in the Water | website=Outside Online | date=2011-07-15 | url=http://www.outsideonline.com/1886916/blood-water | accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four SeaWorld orcas had been delivered by wide-body cargo plane in February 2006, and SeaWorld staff trained a group of Loro Parque trainers in [[San Antonio]] and Orlando.&lt;ref name=Zimmerman-BitW/&gt; In September 2006, Brancheau had pulled a temporary rotation at Loro Parque and reportedly enjoyed working with Martínez.&lt;ref name=Zimmerman-BitW/&gt; SeaWorld discontinued water work at its three parks for about a week immediately after Martínez's death.&lt;ref name=Zimmerman-BitW/&gt;

On August 23, 2010, SeaWorld was fined US$75,000 by OSHA for three safety violations, one directly related to Brancheau's death.&lt;ref name=Kirby-TP&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive: SeaWorld Appeals Ruling in Trainer's Death as Eyewitness Interviews Are Released|url=http://www.takepart.com/article/2012/11/20/seaworld-appeals-ruling-trainers-death-eyewitness-interviews-are-released|date=20 November 2012|first=David|last=Kirby|publisher=TakePart|access-date=2016-02-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212024605/http://www.takepart.com/article/2012/11/20/seaworld-appeals-ruling-trainers-death-eyewitness-interviews-are-released#|archive-date=2016-02-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Obituaries in the Performing Arts, 2010|first=Harris M.|last=Lentz III|page=44|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; OSHA maintained that SeaWorld "willfully" endangered its employees and stated that the company "(shows) Plain indifference to, or intentional disregard for, employee safety and health." SeaWorld issued a statement that called OSHA's findings "unfounded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/unleashed/2010/08/tilikum-orca-sea-world-orlando-osha.html|title=OSHA fines SeaWorld for worker safety issues following orca trainer's death|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 23, 2010|accessdate=August 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; SeaWorld challenged the OSHA fine and the safety report in legal proceedings, stating that "OSHA's allegations in this citation are unsupported by any evidence or precedent and reflect a fundamental lack of understanding of the safety requirements associated with marine mammal care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garcia|first=Jason|title=SeaWorld-OSHA hearing in recess until mid-November|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2011-09-23/business/os-seaworld-osha-killer-whale-20110923_1_tilikum-brancheau-killer-whales|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|date=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SeaWorld Will Fight $75k Fine in Trainer Dawn Brancheau's Death|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20014463-504083.html|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a preliminary hearing in 2011, one of these citations was withdrawn by OSHA.&lt;ref name=OSHRC/&gt;

Subsequently, in late May 2012, Judge Ken S. Welsch formally sided with OSHA over SeaWorld's orca safety practices.&lt;ref name=OSHRC&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oshrc.gov/decisions/pdf_2012/10-1705.pdf# |title=Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission OSHRC, Docket No. 10-1705, Secretary of Labor v. SeaWorld of Florida, LLC. |access-date=2016-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915121648/http://www.oshrc.gov/decisions/pdf_2012/10-1705.pdf# |archive-date=2012-09-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Welsch was sharply critical of SeaWorld's assertion that it was unaware that working with killer whales posed a hazard to employees. Welsch stated it is "implausible" and "difficult to reconcile" with comments repeatedly made by management and with the litany of trainer incidents and injuries that have occurred over the years. Welsch did, however, agree that the fine classification was too severe and had it downgraded – from "willful" (total of $75,000 for the 2 citations) to "serious" (total of $12,000) – stating that the company had emphasized trainer safety, even if the safety procedures weren't effective.&lt;ref name=OSHRC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirby-TP/&gt;

The court was scathing in its assessment of SeaWorld's expert, Mr. Andrews', opinion, "that Tilikum grabbed Ms. Brancheau by the hair out of curiosity because he was unfamiliar with it" as "speculative" and having "no basis in fact". Accordingly, "The court accords it no weight." The court criticized SeaWorld's "closed system" of logic, which blamed trainers for their injuries, by a flawed circularity of reasoning whereby, "SeaWorld believes it 'condition[s] all aspects of behavior.' All behavior is thus predictable. If an undesirable behavior occurs, it is because the trainer missed a known precursor. Ergo, the trainer is always at fault for the killer whale's undesirable behavior. In this closed system, any injuries sustained by a trainer will always be traceable to human error. It is not the operant conditioning program that is inadequate; it is the performance of the trainer that is flawed."

The court made clear that while SeaWorld's expert, "Mr Andrews concludes his report by stating, 'My expert opinion is that SeaWorld can safely allow trainers to closely interact with killer whales, including waterwork, with the administrative and engineering controls that existed prior to February 24, 2010' (Exh. C-15, p.&amp;nbsp;10)," the court found otherwise: "As noted in the section addressing the recognized hazard, SeaWorld's own incident reports demonstrate that its safety program, either due to misplaced faith in operant conditioning or due to human error in implementing operant conditioning, exposes its trainers to the risks of death or serious physical injury." The court amplified this, aligning itself with the OSHA expert witness: "Dr. Duffus stated, '[T]he training program that SeaWorld uses is influential. It does work. My point is that it does not work all the time' (Tr. 911). The court agrees with Dr. Duffus. SeaWorld's training program is highly detailed, well-communicated, and intensive. Yet it cannot remove the element of unpredictability inherent in working with killer whales."&lt;ref name=OSHRC/&gt;

Welsch made it clear that his ruling only applies "to the work trainers do during shows and not at other times, such as during medical procedures or 'relationship-building' sessions... As a custodian SeaWorld has an ethical duty to provide for the whales' needs... husbandry activities require a certain amount of contact between the trainers and whales... unlike performances, which can successfully continue without the trainers in the water." OSHA did state that it would accept other means of protection as long as it provided equal or greater safety as the physical barriers. SeaWorld looked at rising pool floors and "spare air" systems in an attempt to get their staff back in the water during shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-05-30/business/os-seaworld-osha-ruling-20120530_1_seaworld-killer-whale-trainers-killer-whales-marine-park-operator|title=SeaWorld OSHA ruling: Judge rules SeaWorld killer-whale trainers must be protected by physical barriers|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|date=May 30, 2012|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the court rulings, even after 2010, although water work during shows stopped, SeaWorld trainers still entered the water with orcas during "safety desensitization training" and for other care.&lt;ref name=Lee20140820/&gt;

SeaWorld filed a series of appeals, seeking to return to water performances.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Karlamangla/&gt; In 2012, a special Labor Department commission declined to hear the case.&lt;ref name=Kirby-TP/&gt; Since the ''[[Shamu (SeaWorld show)|Shamu]]'' show's interaction of animal trainers with orcas was seen as having been SeaWorld's star attraction,&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; SeaWorld contended that it was fundamental to its business.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;&lt;ref name=USCA121375/&gt; In April 2014, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] denied a "petition for review".&lt;ref name=USCA121375/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuo20140411/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee20140820/&gt; In 2015, SeaWorld was cited again, in [[San Diego]], for not adequately protecting orca trainers.&lt;ref name=AP20160317/&gt;

Although Brancheau's widower, Scott Brancheau, hired a [[Chicago]] law firm that specializes in [[wrongful-death]] litigation, he has not taken any legal action against SeaWorld.&lt;ref name=Garcia-SWTF/&gt;

Her family has said they are grateful that the film has brought attention to the issue of animal welfare. However, they also added that "''Blackfish'' is not Dawn's story" and that "Since Dawn's death in 2010, the media has focused mainly on the whales.

Brancheau's death has been seen as a factor in starting a trajectory of recalibration for SeaWorld.&lt;ref name=Kirby-DaSW/&gt;&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite web|title=SeaWorld phasing out killer whale breeding|website=OrlandoSentinel.com|date=2016-03-17|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-seaworld-phasing-out-killer-whale-breeding-orlando-news-now-20160317-premiumvideo.html|accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Simmons&gt;{{cite web|title=SeaWorld shocker bad for species preservation|website=OrlandoSentinel.com|date=2016-03-19|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/os-ed-seaworld-whale-breed-end-bad-for-conservation-032016-20160319-story.html|accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Bearzi | first=Maddalena | title=The Dark Era of Orca Shows is Ending | website=National Geographic Society (blogs) | date=2016-03-18 | url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2016/03/18/the-dark-era-of-orca-shows-is-ending/ | accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the impact of OSHA-imposed safety-based abatements of previous work practices to prevent further similar events, Cowperthwaite began working on ''Blackfish'' in 2010 following Brancheau's death,&lt;ref name=Kaufman&gt;{{Cite news|first=Amy |last=Kaufman|newspaper=Los Angeles Times | title='Blackfish' filmmaker 'never imagined' her documentary on SeaWorld would have such a major effect | date=2016-03-18 | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-blackfish-director-on-seaworld-orca-breeding-20160318-story.html | accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title='Blackfish' Director On Orcas In Captivity | website=The Huffington Post | date=2013-01-23 | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/23/gabriela-cowperthwaite-blackfish_n_2528286.html | accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially having questions about SeaWorld's "ponytail hypothesis".&lt;ref name=IWI/&gt; Cowperthwaite's background research suggested to her that there were problems with keeping captive orcas; SeaWorld disagreed, characterizing the film as propaganda.&lt;ref name=Kirby-DaSW/&gt;&lt;ref name=WESH24031120&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wesh.com/themeparks/other/seaworld-blackfish-is-propaganda-not-documentary/24031120|title=SeaWorld: 'Blackfish' is propaganda, not documentary|first=Andrea|last=Dennis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its release in 2013, the film awakened a national dialogue about the issue.&lt;ref name=Kirby-DaSW/&gt; SeaWorld struggled with the effect of ''Blackfish'' on public perception,&lt;ref name=cnn20160319/&gt;&lt;ref name=fox/&gt; and there were some cancellations by music performers who had planned to hold shows at SeaWorld.&lt;ref name=bloomberg20160317/&gt;&lt;ref name=WESH24031120/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibson"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Documentary Blackfish Is Still Creating Waves at SeaWorld|first=Megan|last=Gibson|date=December 11, 2013|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; SeaWorld transitioned to being a publicly traded company in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Alden | first=William | title=Public Offering Values SeaWorld at $2.5 Billion | website=DealBook | date=2013-04-20 | url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/seaworld-prices-i-p-o-at-top-of-range/ | accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawmakers in California and the US House of Representatives proposed legislation to phase out orca captivity, and the California Coastal Commission moved in 2015 to ban orca breeding.&lt;ref name=Manby&gt;{{cite web | last=Manby | first=Joel | title=SeaWorld CEO: We're ending our orca breeding program.

===Statutory confidentiality===
In 2011, Florida passed Statute 406.136, which provides for confidentiality of media obtained by public agencies that depicts or records the killing of a person.&lt;ref name=Calvert&gt;Calvert C. ''Cultural Voyeurism''. in: ''Encyclopedia of Media Violence''. Editor Matthew S. Eastin. SAGE Publications, 2013 pages 96–99 {{ISBN|9781483340111}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|98}} The law was partly a response to the circumstances of Brancheau's death.&lt;ref name=Calvert/&gt;
Local government investigators and OSHA had obtained SeaWorld's video surveillance footage, which captured her death, as well as photographs, which showed the effects of the attack. News organizations tried to obtain these media items as records in public custody, but her family expressed privacy considerations and sought to limit "voyeuristic gawking".&lt;ref name=Calvert/&gt;

On behalf of the family, [[Jon L. Mills|Mills]] argued in court that disclosure of media by state agencies is equivalent to dissemination, based on the [[Nikki Catsouras photographs controversy|Catsouras]] case, in which retrospective attempts to limit public access have not been fully successful.&lt;ref&gt;Mills JL. ''Privacy and Press Intrusions: New Media, Old Law''. in: ''The Right to Privacy in the Light of Media Convergence: Perspectives from Three Continents''. Volume 3 of Media Convergence / Medienkonvergenz. Editors: Dieter Dörr, Russell L. Weaver. Publisher: Walter de Gruyter, 2012. {{ISBN|9783110276152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The confidentiality considerations turn on issues that resemble those in the case of the [[murder of Meredith Emerson]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]; the laws that Georgia and Florida enacted in response to these situations are similar.&lt;ref name=Calvert/&gt;

===Foundation===
The Dawn Brancheau Foundation was created by her family in Brancheau's honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox35orlando.com/home/96501881-story|title=The Dawn Brancheau Foundation: 6 years after her death|first=|last=FOX|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Originally opened in 1905, the Eagles Theatre was built as a vaudeville theater, but switched to movies by the 1930’s when it was redecorated in the Art Deco style. The Eagles boasts one of the largest screens remaining in Indiana, has two balconies and a ballroom. The Theatre was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/905|title=Eagles Theatre in Wabash, IN - Cinema Treasures|website=cinematreasures.org|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 4, 2017, the 111-year old Eagles Theatre suspended operations to begin construction on the Renovation Project, a two-year transformation to revitalize the entire building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eaglestheatre.com/|title=Eagles Theatre {{!}} Renovation Project|website=Eagles Theatre {{!}} Renovation Project|language=en|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Egypt's Ten Greatest Discoveries''' is a documentary on the [[Discovery Channel]], written and directed by Ben Mole and hosted by [[Zahi Hawass]], featuring a list of the top ten discoveries of [[Ancient Egyptian]] sites and artifacts which are of cultural significance to the country. The list was compiled by Hawass with the assistance of some of the world's leading [[egyptology|Egyptologists]]. Each discovery has a theme centered on a part of everyday life in Ancient Egypt. For six of those discoveries, a certain emphasis is placed on how some of their themes have managed to influence modern life. The documentary concludes with a short segment on how the practice of [[mummy|mummification]] influenced modern [[surgery]], with both procedures sharing much of the same techniques.

'''Eileen Barton''' (November 24, 1924 &amp;ndash; June 27, 2006) was an [[United States|American]] singer best known for her 1950 hit song, "[[If I Knew You Were Comin' I'd've Baked a Cake]]."

==Early years==
Barton was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. Her birthdate is often given as 1929, but a certified copy of her birth certificate shows that she was born in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.familysearch.org/eng/search/frameset_search.asp?PAGE=/eng/search/ancestorsearchresults.asp |title=Family Search |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done commonly, to shave a few years from a performer's age.

Eileen's parents, Benny and Elsie Barton, were [[vaudeville]] performers.&lt;ref name=at/&gt; She first appeared in her parents' act in Kansas City&lt;ref name=ct&gt;{{cite news|last1=Browning|first1=Norma Lee|title=The 'Bake a Cake' Girl Settles Down to Enjoy Life|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1966/06/07/page/39/article/the-bake-a-cake-girl-settles-down-to-enjoy-life|accessdate=18 September 2015|agency=Chicago Tribune|date=June 7, 1966|page=Section 2-Page 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; at age 2½, singing "[[Ain't Misbehavin' (song)|Ain't Misbehavin']]," as a dare to her parents from columnist (and later radio star) Goodman Ace.&lt;ref name=Barton&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xT4aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KSUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3145,4288600&amp;dq=goodman+ace&amp;hl=en|title=Stars Fell For Barton|author=Pepan, Bea J.|date=8 June 1947|publisher=The Milwaukee Journal|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At 3½, she appeared at the [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theater]], doing two shows a day as part of comedian [[Ted Healy]]'s routine&lt;ref name=at/&gt; (Healy would go on to put together ''[[The Three Stooges]]'').

==Radio==
Barton soon became a child star. By age 6, she appeared on ''[[The Horn and Hardart Children's Hour]]'', a [[radio]] program sponsored by [[Horn &amp; Hardart|Horn &amp; Hardart's Automat]], a then-well-known restaurant chain, and, by age 7, in 1936-37,&lt;ref name="dunningota"&gt;Dunning, John. (1998). ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-507678-3}}. P. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; she was working with [[Milton Berle]] on his ''Community Sing'' [[radio]] program, using the name "Jolly Gillette" and playing the sponsor's "daughter" (the sponsor was [[Global Gillette|Gillette Razors]]).&lt;ref name=Barton/&gt; She would ask to sing, he would tell her she couldn't, and she would remind him that her daddy was the sponsor, so he'd let her sing a current hit song. She also was a regular on ''The Milton Berle Show'' in 1939.&lt;ref name="buxton"&gt;Buxton, Frank and Owen, Bill (1972). ''The Big Broadcast: 1920-1950''. The Viking Press. SBN 670-16240-x. P. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 8, she had a daily singing program of her own on [[WMCA (AM)|radio station WMCA]], ''Arnold's Dinner Club''. At 10, she appeared twice on [[Rudy Vallée]]'s network radio program in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Barthelmess on Air with Vallee|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3242583/belvidere_daily_republican/|agency=Belvidere Daily Republican|date=April 9, 1936|page=5|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = September 17, 2015}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Short and Long of Radio|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3242633/the_evening_news/|agency=The Evening News|date=April 16, 1936|page=13|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = September 17, 2015}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also acted on radio series such as ''[[Death Valley Days]].''

At age 11, she left show business briefly. At age 14 she went on the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway stage]] as an understudy to [[Nancy Walker]] in ''[[Best Foot Forward (musical)|Best Foot Forward]],''&lt;ref name=Barton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eileen Barton|url=http://www.playbillvault.com/Person/Detail/78101/Eileen-Barton|website=Playbill Vault|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by an appearance under her own name with [[Elaine Stritch]] in ''[[Angel in the Wings]].''

At age 15, she appeared as a guest singer on a [[Johnny Mercer]] variety series, leading to her being noticed by [[Frank Sinatra]], who took her under his wing and put her in a regular spot on the [[CBS]] radio show that he hosted in the 1940s. She co-starred on [[The Frank Sinatra Show (radio program)#The Frank Sinatra Show (Frank Sinatra In Person) (1944-45)|Sinatra's show]] beginning August 16, 1944,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eileen Barton with 'Voice'|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3242746/the_circleville_herald/|agency=The Circleville Herald|date=August 15, 1944|page=7|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = September 17, 2015}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Templeton Guest On Sinatra's Show Wednesday Night|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3237986/harrisburg_telegraph/|agency=Harrisburg Telegraph|date=November 11, 1944|page=15|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = September 16, 2015}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also part of Sinatra's act at the [[Paramount Theatre (Los Angeles)|Paramount Theater]] in 15 appearances there.&lt;ref name=Barton/&gt; She also appeared on her own and as a guest performer with such stars as Duke Ellington, [[Count Basie]], [[Nat King Cole]], and [[Danny Kaye]].

In 1945, Barton had her own [[radio]] program, ''Teen Timers.''&lt;ref name=at&gt;{{cite news|title=Radio Guide Listening Post|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3237194/altoona_tribune/|agency=Altoona Tribune|date=September 25, 1945|page=12|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = September 16, 2015}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; That November, the program's name was changed to ''The Eileen Barton Show''. It was broadcast Saturday mornings on [[NBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Teen' Program Switch Nets Soxers 1 1/2 Hrs. Sat.

==Recording==
Her first record, done for [[Capitol Records]], was "Would You Believe Me?" (catalog number 402), with the orchestra of [[Skitch Henderson|Lyle "Skitch" Henderson]], in 1948.

In 1949 she cut the record of "[[If I Knew You Were Comin' I'd've Baked a Cake]]" (written by [[Bob Merrill]], [[Al Hoffman|Albert Hoffman]] and [[Al Trace]]; Trace used the pseudonym Clem Watts) and introduced it on [[Don McNeill (performer)|Don McNeill's]] radio program, ''[[Don McNeill's Breakfast Club|The Breakfast Club]].'' On the record, Trace's band musicians backed her, but were given billing as "The New Yorkers." It was first released by [[National Records]], a New York–based company mostly specializing in [[rhythm &amp; blues]] records, as catalog number 9103, and when National's owner, Al Green, decided it was too big a seller for National to handle, it was later distributed by [[Mercury Records]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cross|first1=Leo H.|title=Chips From the Listening Post|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3237168/the_san_bernardino_county_sun/|agency=The San Bernardino County Sun|date=March 5, 1950|page=16|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = September 16, 2015}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose co-owner was Al Green's son, [[Irving Green]]. The record became one of the best-selling records on an independent label of all time, [[List of Billboard number-one singles of 1950|charting at #1]] best selling in stores for 2 weeks and most played by jockeys for 10 weeks, and altogether on the [[Billboard charts]] for over four months.

In a 2005 interview for the liner-notes of her Jasmine Records CD release, Eileen indicated that she never received a penny in royalties from either National or Mercury for her record's success, although by contract she was supposed to receive 5% of each sale.

After the success of this record, she became a [[night club]] and stage performer, appearing at all the important clubs in [[New York City]] and many others. In the 1950s, she was a featured singer with [[Guy Lombardo]] and his orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guy Lombardo Discovers Singers Are Expensive Item|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3237886/newport_daily_news/|agency=Newport Daily News|date=August 13, 1952|page=7|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = September 16, 2015}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Barton began recording for [[Epic Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Disk Derby|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1956/09/01/page/14/article/the-disk-derby|accessdate=18 September 2015|agency=Chicago Tribune|date=September 1, 1956|page=Part 1-Page 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She continued to record for both National and Mercury, making "Honey, Won't You Honeymoon with Me?" (catalog number 9109) and "May I Take Two Giant Steps?" (catalog number 9112) for National and "[[You Brought a New Kind of Love]]" (catalog number 5410) for Mercury.

Later she moved over to [[Coral Records]], and charted with some cover versions of songs that were bigger hits for other artists, such as "[[Cry (Churchill Kohlman song)|Cry]]", "[[Sway (song)|Sway]]", and others. She also appeared in motion pictures and television, working the restaurant and night club circuit well into the 1970s.

==Personal life==
Barton married industrialist Dan Shaw in Juarez, Mexico, April 15, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eileen Barton Weds Executive|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3238018/the_indiana_gazette/|agency=The Indiana Gazette|date=April 20, 1961|page=5|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = September 16, 2015}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Barton died at her [[West Hollywood]] home from [[ovarian cancer]] at the age of 81. She had no children and was not married at the time of her death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4214">'''Flicker-free''' is a term given to [[video display]]s, primarily [[cathode ray tube]]s, operating at a high [[refresh rate]] to reduce or eliminate the perception of [[Flicker (screen)|screen flicker]]. For televisions, this involves operating at a '''100 Hz''' or '''120 Hz''' [[hertz]] [[field rate]] to eliminate flicker, compared to standard televisions that operate at 50 Hz ([[PAL]], [[SÉCAM]] [[broadcast television system|systems]]) or 60 Hz ([[NTSC]]), most simply done by displaying each field twice, rather than once. For computer displays, this is usually a refresh rate of 70–90 Hz, sometimes 100 Hz or higher. This should not be confused with [[motion interpolation]], though they may be combined – see [[#Implementation|implementation]], below.

Televisions operating at these frequencies are often labelled as being 100 or 120 Hz without using the words ''flicker-free'' in the description.

== Prevalence ==
The term is primarily used for CRTs, especially televisions in 50 Hz countries (PAL or SECAM) and computer monitors from the 1990s and early 2000s – the 50 Hz rate of PAL/SECAM video (compared with 60 Hz NTSC video) and the relatively large computer monitors and close viewing distances of 1990s/2000s computer monitors (hence making more of the screen in the viewer's [[peripheral vision]]) make flicker most noticeable on these devices.

Contrary to popular belief, modern LCD monitors are not flicker free, since most of them use [[pulse-width modulation]] (PWM) for brightness control. As the brightness setting is lowered, the flicker becomes more noticeable, since the period when the backlight is active in each PWM duty cycle shortens. The problem is much more pronounced on modern LED backlit monitors, because LED backlight reacts faster to changes in current. 
== Implementation ==
The goal is to display images sufficiently frequently to exceed the human [[flicker fusion threshold]], and hence create the impression of a constant (non-flickering) source.

In computer displays this consists of changing the frame rate of the produced signal in the [[video card]] (and in sync with this, the displayed image on the display). This is limited by the clock speed of the video adapter and frame rate required of the program – for a given pixel clock speed, higher refresh rates require lower resolution or color depth, and higher frame rates require that the program producing the video recalculate the screen more frequently. For these reasons, refresh rates above 90–100 Hz to reduce flicker are uncommon on computers – these rates are sufficient to eliminate flicker.

On television, this is more involved, as the source material has a fixed frame rate (and is also traditionally [[interlaced video]], in which one-half of the scan lines of each frame are broadcast at a time). Most simply, the frame rate can be doubled by simply displaying the same broadcast image twice in rapid succession, as is done with [[movie projector]]s (which display each frame of 24 fps film two or more times) – either displaying each field twice or alternating fields.

Alternatively, this can involve [[motion interpolation]], where rather than displaying the original fields twice, creates interpolated images between the original frames. This may be combined with [[deinterlacing]], converting the image to [[progressive scan]] (attempting to create a full picture from the two half images).

Higher refresh rates, while they reduce flicker, may cause other problems. Simply redisplaying the fields may cause [[judder]], particularly on fast moving images, as the image is displayed repeatedly in the same location, rather than moving smoothly. Conversely, interpolation (which avoids judder and may create more fluid motion than in the original video) can instead cause blurring, particularly visible on fast scrolling text. See [[motion interpolation]] for further discussion.

'''Franeleros''' are people who have as main activity guarding or keeping an eye on cars parked in several streets in certain places in large [[Mexico|Mexican]] cities, getting a [[Tipping by region#Mexico|tip]] as a reward, which sometimes is established by them. The term comes from the Spanish word ''franela'', meaning flannel, which is a small piece of soft light fabric (normally washed out [[red]] or [[gray]]) which they use to wash the cars if they are asked to, or to simply wave it around to give parking indications. ''Franeleros'' are sometimes also known as ''cuida-coches'' (car keepers) or ''"viene vienes"'' (literally "come come"), which is the phrase they commonly say while giving the parking indications. In 2007, due to the criticisms around this controversial "occupation" (mainly [[extortion]], [[Motor vehicle theft|grand theft auto]], relation with [[organized crime]] and illegal use of [[public space]]) this guarding activity became illegal in [[Mexico City]], but it is still widely practiced. In areas where [[Parking in Mexico City|parking meters have been installed]], franeleros no longer operate.

A central tenet of ''franeleros'' is the implicit threat that they will intentionally [[Property damage|destroy or vandalize]] cars if the owner does not pay them, making the activity a form of [[extortion]]. Franeleros will often block empty spaces with trashcans, empty jugs, flowerpots or bricks, and remove them when their "customers" park.

[[File:Anti_franelero_banner,_colonia_Roma,Mexico_City.jpg|thumbnail|Banner exhorting citizens not to give money to ''franeleros'' in Colonia Roma, Mexico City, August 2016]]

==Location==
''Franeleros'' are commonly located in big and medium size cities, especially in areas with a big demand for parking spaces; they may also be present when parking lots have high fares. They are usually found around touristic places (such as [[Mexico City]] downtown and  [[Coyoacán]]), universities and schools, business and office areas (notably [[Santa Fe (Mexico City)|Santa Fe]] and [[Polanco (Mexico)|Polanco]]), [[shopping mall]]s, night life areas, restaurants, banks, markets, supermarkets and commercial zones. Since many of these places in Mexico often have a poor parking infrastructure, limited offer of parking spaces, high fares in parking lots, or simply an unusually high demand for parking spaces, many drivers leave their cars in streets, which attracts ''franeleros'' who are eager to earn tips.

==Tipping==
Although tipping ''franeleros'' or not and the amount given should be optional for the driver as it is only a [[Gratuity|tip]] (optional by definition), it is often seen that ''franeleros'' ask for fixed amounts of money. The tip usually ranges from 2 to 30 [[Mexican pesos]] (0.2 - 3 [[USD]]), being this quantity a function of the:

*'''Area -''' ''Franeleros'' ask for bigger tips in business areas, getting up to 20 [[MXN]] (Mexican pesos) per car for the entire day. With people who use their "service" daily, they usually make a weekly arrangement which implies a 10-20% reduction; with this arrangement they sometimes save up a space for their [[customer|client]] and they might even serve as [[valet parking]]. In touristic places and universities they often ask from 5 to 15 MXN for the while. In medium demand places such as supermarkets and other commercial zones people tip them with 2 to 5 MXP; these places are of the few to remain really optional to tip. The highest tips are asked around night life areas, which normally lack adequate parking spaces; in this places ''franeleros'' ask from 15 to 30 MXP. In extremely high demand situations (concerts and sports events), they may even charge 50 to 100 MXN.
*'''Space availability -''' Higher demand implies a higher tip. In some areas where there is continuous and permanent high affluence of cars (like business areas and universities), there are more ''franeleros'' and the tips they ask are higher.
*'''Time spent in the place -''' ''These people'' sometimes ask for their tip according to the time that the car spent on "their" space. If it is really fast, the tip could be small and may even remain optional. For longer periods of time the ask for more. Sometimes they ask the driver how long will he/she delay to say an amount.
*'''Time of the day -''' As explained above, ''franeleros'' ask for more money during the night, even if it is the same place. Also at peak hours where there is less availability they charge more to find a space.
*'''Car's brand -''' ''Franeleros'' sometimes ask for bigger sums of money if it is an expensive car, inferring that if the driver has a good car, he/she might also have more money.
*'''Presence of other ''franeleros'' and parking lots -''' ''Franeleros'' sometimes compete among themselves, they reserve certain parking spaces for themselves and charge less or more to generate more income. If there is a parking lot nearby, they usually charge less than its tariff to give an incentive to drivers to leave their car with them.
*'''Presence of police in the area -''' As this activity became formally [[Law|illegal]] in 2007 in some Mexican cities, sometimes ''franeleros'' incur in [[bribery]] to be allowed to do their "work". If this is the case, they charge more money so they are able to bribe the [[police]] daily and still have some income. This practice has led to corruption in many police organizations.

== Plot ==
Hermanitas Calle follows two women who struggle to overcome adversity and achieve fame with their powerful voices. In the telenovela, the women are forced to support their families with their talent in a sexist country. As a result of the prejudice, the music the women perform is not well regarded by members of the community.

'''Julie Baroh''' (b. August 4, 1970) is an American [[fantasy artist]] who also works in [[Glassblowing|glass]].

==Life and activities==
Julie Baroh was born in [[Seattle]], Washington on August 4, 1970. Majoring in sculpture and [[printmaking]] at the [[Cornish College of the Arts]], she received her [[Bachelors of Fine Arts|BFA]] in 1994. While still in college, she was recruited to work for the gaming company [[Wizards of the Coast]] as a freelance artist and published work in the company's magazines ''[[Scrye]]'' and ''[[The Duelist]]'' as well as illustrations for the [[collectible card game]], [[Magic: The Gathering]] throughout the 1990s. After training in graphic and network applications, Baroh worked for [[Adobe Systems]] in the late 1990s, before leaving "to return to her fine arts roots".&lt;ref name=f8&gt;Frank, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first decade of the 21st century, she published work in ''Watercolor Fairies: A Step by Step Guide to Creating the Fairy World'', ''The Art of Faery'' and the ''Big Book of Contemporary Illustration''. Baroh was art director of the magazine ''Blood and Thunder'' for a year and a contributing layout designer for two years. She "specializes in whimsical animals and characters
painted with a light touch, set in a fantasy realm: goblins and fairies, and mythological flora
and fauna. In her fine art she pursues figuration and portraiture, using classical drawing techniques. Most of her work is done in watercolor or gouache."&lt;ref name=f8/&gt; 

==Personal life==
Baroh is married and is a member of the [[artist collective]] Krab Jab Studio and the Seattle Illustrator's Collective.&lt;ref name=f8/&gt;

'''KidzMondo''' is an indoor theme park designed for [[children]] aged 2 to 14 years and their parents.  It’s a miniature replica of a real [[city]] where children get to role-play as adults in various occupations and professions.

==The Concept==
KidzMondo is an indoor theme park following the conceptual approach of [[educational entertainment]] or playful learning. It is an ideal forum where social rules and values are promoted and ingrained in children to prepare them to behave as good adult citizens would in real life.

KidzMondo aims to compliment local school curricula and seeks to teach children basic citizenship values and rules, enlightening them about the society they live in today.

It is an established fact that children learn best through play and experiencing real hands on activities. The range of playful activities inside KidzMondo is exclusively created and constructed to help, encourage and advance physical growth while stimulating intellectual growth. The KidzMondo Educational Curriculum improves the development of skills and attitudes all the while motivating creative thinking and enhancing self-esteem and self-confidence levels.

Children can choose between 120+ different professions which are practiced in replica of the most representative establishments in an actual city; an airport, a bank, factories, a theater, shops, a police station, a fire department, a newspaper, a hotel, a TV studio, a radio station, a gas station, a race track and many more…

KidzMondo provides children with a relevant and tangible learning experience, appealing to the need to address and encourage interest. Children will be exposed to age-appropriate activities in a dynamic and safe surrounding. They will be attracted to go through the different establishments, while providing them with a mental and physical voyage of investigation, exploration, and adults' role play.

==Constitution for Children==
KidzMondo’s constitution and its ideas of equality, respect for all, and the rights for self-expression and creativity are essential. As the children explore the world of KidzMondo, they will be learning valuable lessons in what it means to be a citizen "kidizen", as well as civic and social responsibility, essential self-reliance, and fiscal maturity. These lessons will stay with them well into their adult life, and serve to prepare the future generation for the tremendous challenges that lie ahead.
Since the Theme Park operates as though it were a city, the visiting children are expected to act according to the following Constitution:
1.	All Kidizens are Equal and United in play. 
2.	Kidizens have the right to be Happy and Free. 
3.	Kidizens have the right to Explore, Discover and be Curious about the World. 
4.	Kidizens have the right to Express themselves and be Creative. 
5.	Kidizens have the right to be treated with Respect. 
6.	Kidizens are always Polite, Honest and Kind. 
7.	Kidizens have the duty to Respect others including their elders. 
8.	Kidizens have a duty to help others when they can. 
9.	Kidizens have a duty to Protect nature and the environment. 
10.	Kidizens have their rights and duties guarded by the constitution of KidzMondo.

==Characters==
Four characters help make the concept of KidzMondo more relatable and entertaining to children. They also represent the pillars of the KidzMondo constitution through their actions and values.

Born on Science Day (October 5) Kozmo is a loveable 10-year-old boy with big brown eyes and chestnut brown messy hair. He loves sports, technology and going on all kinds of adventures, especially the ones where the entire family can join in. He is caring, friendly, and very extroverted. He has a curious mind and is fascinated by everything and everyone. He is very spontaneous like most 10-year-old boys.

Born on Flowers Day (May 3) Ëena is a 6-year-old average sized "little miss perfect". She knows how to get her way. She  is  a  very  curious  girl,  always  asking  questions  for  deductive  reasoning (always answers them herself). She considers herself responsible for everyone and as a result she is the glue that holds the entire family together. It is her passion to guide and advise them on the right course of action.

A Roman Sheepdog born on Friendship Day (July 20), Dogzilla is the original guardian of KidzMondo. He was too late to leave the city when the Roman children abandoned it in ancient times and was locked in. Dogzilla was able to live for over 2000 years through the magic of KidzMondo, guarding the city against any invaders. When the founders arrived, he was extremely happy to see someone. He decided to dedicate his life to serving the founders, protecting the city and all its inhabitants.

A large and wise middle-aged tortoise born on World Turtles Day (May 23), Leeloo is Ëena’s personal assistant. She is very organized and has everything arranged in order. The only problem is that she is always sleeping or daydreaming. When she does wake up she is very slow and only cares about one thing, how to assist Kozmo and Ëena to the best of her ability.

==City Map==
The architectural layout of the KidzMondo city is much like any real city in the world with a central plaza, clock tower, fire station, police station, hospital and many other functional establishments spread throughout the two-story buildings. However, the size of the buildings is all scaled down to cater to children and provide a more realistic experience for them.

==Safety and Security==

KidzMondo has been working with safety consultants from around the world and has employed the latest technologies to ensure the safety and security of the children. They have managed to meet international standards for amusement parks by equipping the city with the latest technologies. Upon arrival, each child will be given a security bracelet called a "KidzBand." It is an RFID security bracelet consisting of wireless technology that uses radio frequencies to identify and track kids inside the city at any time.

In addition to the hundreds of CCTV cameras installed to track kids around the city, KidzMondo assigns security personnel to be present 24 hours a day.

Moreover, KidzMondo staff has all received training sessions in first aid and rescue, and in case of emergency a nurse is always present at the premises for assistance.

==Other Services==

KidzMondo also provides a birthday party venue with customizable themes, school trip organization, and a summer camp.

Birthdays: KidzMondo plan and facilitate birthday parties for young birthday girls and boys. Parents can choose from a collection of party themes.

School trips: The activities provided at KidzMondo compliment various school curricula at different age levels. Schools all over the country plan trips to KidzMondo to provide their students with an experience that is both entertaining and educational.

Summer camp: During the summer, KidzMondo organizes a series of week-long summer camps, each revolving around a specific theme (or educational major), including theater, medicine, sports, etc. All the activities carried out throughout the summer camp will be directly related to that major.

==Marketing Partners==

Enhancing the atmosphere of realism of the city of KidzMondo depends heavily on partnerships with esteemed AAA (triple A) companies and brands which are anchors on the development and growth of the city.

For every child-sized establishment, one, and only one, leading brand is chosen exclusively to represent its industry. No two partners are ever chosen to represent the same category or industry. KidzMondo provides a one-of-a-kind marketing channel that is more encompassing than traditional media for its marketing value. Brand messages are incorporated into daily life to allow children to experience various products and services provided by the different esteemed brands. KidzMondo also promotes interactive qualitative marketing, where children experience the marketing partners' products with their five senses: the children see, smell, touch, taste, and play with the brand. Since the children of today are the customers of tomorrow, they develop an unmatchable and long-lasting loyalty from a very early age and nurture it until they grow up. This demonstrates how partnering with KidzMondo brings about a long-term impact. In addition to that, children not only impact industries manufacturing toys, candy, or cars but they also influence purchasing decisions made my parents.

==Franchise Expansion==
The KidzMondo project signed on to open a branch in Turkey in collaboration with the Doğan Holding Company in 2012. KidzMondo Istanbul started its soft opening on Jan 6, 2014, wherein the first school visit was held.

Another KidzMondo branch is set to open in Abu Dhabi.

A contract has also been signed between KidzMondo Chairman Ali Kazma and Senator Mohammed Yassin Dogmoch, Chairman of the Dogmoch Group and German companies, to open 20 more branches across Europe .  Preparations and Construction have already begun in Spain, Germany. Five KidzMondo branches are expected to be open and functional in Europe by 2021 .

==International Affiliations==
KidzMondo is also a registered member of the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Organization .

'''Laurel Rose Willson''' (August 18, 1941 – April 8, 2002) was an American woman born in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], whose allegations of [[satanic ritual abuse]] were published under the alias '''Lauren Stratford''', which she would later adopt as her legal name. Later, Willson assumed the guise of a [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor, and adopted the alias of '''Laura Grabowski'''.

==Early life==
Willson was adopted as an infant by Frank Cole Willson and his wife, schoolteacher Rose Gray Willson. A gifted musician from a young age, Willson learned to play the piano, clarinet, and flute. After college, Willson worked as a public-school music teacher. She later resided in [[Bakersfield, California]] for a number of years, becoming known within [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian churches there as a vocalist and pianist.

==Satanic ritual abuse allegations==
As Stratford, Willson wrote three books, the most famous of which was ''Satan's Underground'', purporting to tell a true story of her upbringing as a baby breeder (for sacrifices) in a satanic cult. Willson had also claimed to have first-hand knowledge of high-profile cases of alleged Satanic ritual abuse (including the [[Kern County child abuse cases|child abuse cases in Kern County]], where she resided), but her claims were dismissed by investigators as unreliable and fabricated.

An investigation by [[Robert Passantino|Bob and Gretchen Passantino]] and Jon Trott in the Christian magazine ''[[Cornerstone (magazine)|Cornerstone]]'' discovered Stratford's real name and family background, and that her stories of abuse were false.&lt;ref name="stratford"&gt;Bob &amp; Gretchen Passantino and Jon Trott, "[http://www.answers.org/satan/stratford.html Satan's Sideshow: The True Lauren Stratford Story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031002043633/http://www.answers.org/satan/stratford.html |date=October  2, 2003 }}", Cornerstone, 1990 Vol. 18, Issue 90&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews with Willson's family and former associates, it was revealed that Willson had a long history of mental illness and making false allegations of abuse. She repeatedly threatened suicide and practiced [[self-mutilation]]. She attracted the attention and sympathy of evangelical author [[Johanna Michaelsen]], one of the most influential promoters of the Satanic [[moral panic]] of the period. While living with Michaelsen, Willson claimed to have given birth to three children as a result of rape; two were allegedly killed in [[snuff film]]s, and the third was supposedly [[human sacrifice|sacrificed]] in her presence at a Satanic ritual. However, ''Cornerstone'' found no evidence that she had ever been pregnant or adopted a child.

She was also briefly involved in the [[McMartin preschool trial]], claiming to have witnessed the abuses and to have been involved in an ongoing lesbian relationship with Virginia McMartin.&lt;ref name="stratford"/&gt;

==False identity as a Holocaust survivor==
After her books were withdrawn from sale by her publisher, Willson legally changed her name to Lauren Stratford. She would later create another false identity in 1999, with an equally horrific story to tell. Pretending to be Laura Grabowski, a Jewish survivor of [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]], Willson collected thousands of dollars in donations intended for Holocaust survivors. As Grabowski, Willson befriended [[Binjamin Wilkomirski]], claiming to remember him from the camps. Wilkomirski himself (real name Bruno Grosjean) was later revealed to be neither Jewish nor a Holocaust survivor, aiding in the exposure of Willson as a fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.org/satan/laura.html Lauren Stratford: From Satanic Ritual Abuse to Jewish Holocaust Survivor] – ''Cornerstone'' magazine's exposé of Stratford's claim to be Laura Grabowski&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Little Carib Theatre was formally opened in November 1948. The foundation stone was laid by [[Paul Robeson]], who at the time was visiting Trinidad, and whom the founder Beryl McBurnie had met in New York.&lt;ref name=Raymond&gt;Judy Raymond, [http://caribbean-beat.com/issue-20/beryl-mcburnie-first-lady-dance#axzz3tRDzalgO "Beryl McBurnie: the First Lady of Dance"], ''[[Caribbean Beat]]'', Issue 20 (July/August 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pearl Connor]], [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/apr/29/guardianobituaries1 "Beryl McBurnie" (obituary)], ''The Guardian'' (London), 29 April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, the work of the Little Carib Dance Company had been recognised and celebrated overseas, having performed at such events as the Caribbean Festival of Arts in [[Puerto Rico]] in 1952, the [[Jamaica]] Tercentenary Celebrations in 1955 and the opening of the Federal Parliament of [[Toronto]] in April 1958. In the 1960s the Little Carib building had to be closed down and was re-built in three years.&lt;ref name=Raymond /&gt;

Many of the plays of [[Nobel Prize]]-winner [[Derek Walcott]] were first staged at the Little Carib Theatre,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/NGO-pays-tribute-to-Derek-Walcott-296153751.html "NGO pays tribute to Derek Walcott"], ''Sunday Express'' (Trinidad), 12 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Banham, Errol Hill, George Woodyard (eds), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qtlUwQAvKxoC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;lpg=PA247&amp;dq=little+carib+theatre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Tro34hcYjL&amp;sig=xiv2RJgIbkbK4y2vALmeHO_aE8I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiR1ejom6fdAhUHEVAKHUk9DnMQ6AEwJXoECC4QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=little%20carib%20theatre&amp;f=false ''The Cambridge Guide to African and Caribbean Theatre''], Cambridge University Press, 1994, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; where he held weekly theatre workshops&lt;ref name=Raymond /&gt; as founding director, from 1959 to 1971, of what became the [[Trinidad Theatre Workshop]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changeperformingarts.com/artists/walcott.html "Derek Walcott"], Change Performing Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinidadtheatreworkshop.com/#!history/chp0 "History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708173538/http://www.trinidadtheatreworkshop.com/ |date=2013-07-08 }}, Trinidad Theatre Workshop.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lock n' Load with R. Lee Ermey''''' is a reality television series about the development of military weaponry throughout the centuries.  Hosted by actor and former [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] [[drill instructor]] [[R. Lee Ermey]], its one season originally aired on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] channel in 2009.

==Format==
In a typical episode, Ermey focused on one specific type of weapon or weapon system, presenting key advancements in its technology and demonstrating their use with the help of experts. In a holdover from his duties hosting ''[[Mail Call]]'' on the History Channel, he frequently added humor in the form of light-hearted [[drill instructor]] haranguing aimed at the viewer. He also displayed an eagerness to try out the episode's relevant weapons against a wide range of targets, particularly [[watermelon]]s ("they taste better after being shot with a machine gun"), as well as glass bottles.

The pilot episode was produced by Simon J. Heath, who also developed the concept.

==Episodes==

The pilot episode first aired in December 2008. This rated well and was followed by a series in 2009. The show premiered on July 26, 2009 and only ran for one season and ended up getting cancelled in November 2009.&lt;ref name=IMDbEpisodes/&gt;

'''Merle Slease Evans''' (December 26, 1891{{spaced ndash}}December 31, 1987) was a cornet player and circus band conductor who conducted the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] for fifty years. He was known as the "[[Arturo Toscanini|Toscanini]] of the Big Top." Evans was inducted into the [[American Bandmasters Association]] in 1947 and the [[International Circus Hall of Fame]] in 1975.

==Early life==
Merle Evans was born in Columbus, Kansas in 1891. His father was a foreman in a coal mine. He had six siblings. Evans had an early job selling newspapers on corners. He used his cornet to call attention to the headlines.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, Gene. Merle Evans: Maestro of the Circus. Miami, FL: E.A. Seemann Publishing, Inc., 1971. p.20&lt;/ref&gt; He is featured in Tom Rhoads' farcical history of Columbus.&lt;ref&gt;Rhoads, Tom (2017) NED The Impresario of Columbus, Kansas.  Kindle Books. See also: https://www.nedtheimpresario.com/&lt;/ref&gt; After holding several other jobs, Evans left home and joined the S.W. Brundage us Carnival Company as a cornet player. Evans held several other jobs, including as a band director for the [[Miller Brothers 101 Ranch]] Wild West Show featuring [[Buffalo Bill]],

==Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp;amp; Bailey Circus==
Evans was hired as the band director for the newly merged [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp;amp; Bailey Circus]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Charles Conrad. "Evans, Merle Slease." In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2085095 (accessed February 10, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Evans held this job for fifty years, until his retirement in 1969. He only missed performances due to a musicians union strike in 1942 and the death of his first wife.&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor, R.L. "One Beat to the Bar (A Profile of Merle Evans." ''Circus Fanfare'', XXI (1991), no. 4, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote eight circus marches, including ''Symphonia'' and ''Fredella''.&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt;

===Hartford Circus Fire===
{{main|Hartford Circus Fire}}
On July 6, 1944, a fire broke out during a Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey Circus performance. The fire killed around 168 people. The quick reaction of Merle Evans and his band is credited with saving thousands of lives. When Evans saw the fire, he signaled that the band should play [[John Philip Sousa]]’s “[[Stars and Stripes Forever]],” used in the circus as the “disaster march,” indicating an emergency. The performers heard the music and immediately began the evacuation. Accounts state that Evans and his band played until it was no longer safe to do so, and then evacuated and reformed outside, where their playing helped to pace the evacuation and steady the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, 122-125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life, retirement and death==
After his retirement, Evans continued to live an active life. He served as a director of the Columbus State Bank in his hometown of Columbus, Kansas. He gave workshops and guest-led bands around the country.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, 139-152&lt;/ref&gt; His second wife was Nena, who served as secretary to the owners and executives of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey circus. Evans died in Sarasota, Florida on December 31, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Saxon, Wolfgang. “Merle Evans is Dead; Former Band Leader at Ringling Bros.” ‘The New York Times’. January 3, 1988. https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/03/obituaries/merle-evans-is-dead-former-band-leader-at-ringling-brothers.html. Accessed 2/10/2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Eastern Fells cover.jpg|thumb|right|The 2005 anniversary cover of ''The Eastern Fells''. Apart from the bottom banner, the design has not changed since first publication.]]&lt;!-- FAIR USE of Eastern Fells cover.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Eastern Fells cover.jpg for rationale --&gt;
'''''A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells''''' is a series of seven books by [[Alfred Wainwright|A. Wainwright]], detailing the [[fell]]s (the local word for hills and mountains) of the [[Lake District]] in northwest England. Written over a period of 13 years from 1952, they consist entirely of reproductions of Wainwright's [[manuscript]], hand-produced in [[pen and ink]] with no [[typesetting|typeset]] material.

The series has been in print almost continuously since it was first published between 1955 and 1966, with more than 2 million copies sold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wainwright.org.uk/events/2007/centenary.html The Wainwright Society – The Alfred Wainwright Centenary 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223032853/http://www.wainwright.org.uk/events/2007/centenary.html |date=23 December 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is still regarded by many [[hillwalking|walkers]] as the definitive guide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Steve|title=Wainwright guides face the axe|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/11/ruralaffairs.books|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Backhouse|first1=Steve|title=Walking the Wainwrights|url=http://magazine.scouts.org.uk/getactive/walking-the-wainwrights/|website=Scouting|publisher=The Scout Association|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the Lakeland mountains. The 214 fells described in the seven volumes have become known as [[list of Wainwrights|the Wainwrights]]. {{asof|2013}} the [[LDWA]] register of those who have climbed all the fells listed 674 names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hillwalkers' Register|url=http://www.ldwa.org.uk/hillwalkers/hillwalkers.php|website=Long Distance Walkers Association|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wainwright Society maintains a "register of current Society members who have climbed all 214 fells"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wainwright 214 Completers Register|url=http://www.wainwright.org.uk/214_completers.html#of|website=The Wainwright Society|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First editions==
The first five books were originally published by Wainwright's friend, Henry Marshall, Chief Librarian of Kendal and Westmorland, who took charge of publicity and administration. Another friend, Sandy Hewitson (of Bateman and Hewitson Ltd) agreed to print the books using Wainwright's original manuscript, although in fact the printing was done by ''[[Westmorland Gazette|The Westmorland Gazette]]'' in Kendal, who had taken over Bateman and Hewitson Ltd. From 1963, Westmorland Gazette also became the publisher, and their name appears as such on the first impressions of Books Six and Seven. The books, together with details of the first impressions, are:

*Book One — ''The Eastern Fells'', published by Henry Marshall in 1955 (no dustwrapper, dark green cloth boards with gold lettering)
*Book Two — ''The Far Eastern Fells'', published by Henry Marshall in 1957 (dustwrapper priced 12/6, grey cloth boards with red lettering)
*Book Three — ''The Central Fells'', published by Henry Marshall in 1958 (dustwrapper priced 12/6, light blue cloth boards with silver lettering)
*Book Four — ''The Southern Fells'', published by Henry Marshall in 1960 (dustwrapper priced 12/6, brownish orange cloth boards with dark blue lettering)
*Book Five — ''The Northern Fells'', published by Henry Marshall in 1962 (dustwrapper priced 12/6, reddish brown cloth boards with silver lettering)
*Book Six — ''The North Western Fells'', published by Westmorland Gazette in 1964 (dustwrapper priced 12/6, yellow cloth boards with dark blue lettering)
*Book Seven — ''The Western Fells'', published by Westmorland Gazette in 1966 (dustwrapper priced 15/-, green boards with silver lettering)

The second impression of Book One, released at Easter 1956, came with a dustwrapper, and customers who had previously bought a jacket-less first impression could obtain a dustwrapper from the printer.&lt;ref name="Davis165166"&gt;''Wainwright: The Biography'' by [[Hunter Davis]] (1995) First Edition, pp. 165–166&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, most first impressions of Book One still in existence usually have a dustwrapper priced at 12/6.
In 1992, a year after Wainwright's death, [[Michael Joseph (publisher)|Michael Joseph]] took control of all of Wainwright's books, including the Pictorial Guides, a change of which Wainwright himself was in favour.&lt;ref name="Davis165166"/&gt; When they ceased publication in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;"Wainwright guides are shelved" [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2657249.stm BBC website]&lt;/ref&gt; the rights were bought by [[Frances Lincoln]]&lt;ref&gt;Frances Lincoln [http://www.wainwright.org.uk/article/030214_franceslincoln.html Press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818043526/http://www.wainwright.org.uk/article/030214_franceslincoln.html |date=18 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who shortly afterwards embarked on a revised Second Edition of the guides.

==Style and layout==
[[Image:Pike of Blisco ascent.png|thumb|right|A typical page from ''The Southern Fells'', describing an ascent of [[Pike of Blisco]]. The diagrams of ascent are perhaps the most innovative feature of the Pictorial Guides.]]

Each of the fells covered by the guides has its own chapter, which normally includes a [[map]] of the fell, comprehensive details and 3-dimensional&lt;!--can anyone suggest a better way of describing these, they're not plan, elevation or perspective--&gt; drawings of ascent routes, [[ridge]] routes to other fells, routes of descent and a description of the summit. Carefully annotated [[pen and ink]] drawings of ascents and views accompany the details of each fell. Each book starts with a description of the geography of the area and ends with ''Some personal notes in conclusion''.

Unlike many authors who [[dedication|dedicate]] books to particular people known to them, Wainwright commences each book with an unusual dedication. These are:

* Book 1: "The Men of the [[Ordnance Survey]]"
* Book 2: "The Men who Built the Stone Walls"
* Book 3: "The Dogs of Lakeland"
* Book 4: "The Sheep of Lakeland"
* Book 5: "The Solitary wanderers on the fells"
* Book 6: "My right leg and my left leg"
* Book 7: "All who have helped me"

Wainwright, notoriously shy, also includes one drawing of himself in each book, generally from behind, of him admiring a particular view. These are:

*Book 1: View of [[Blencathra]] from [[Clough Head]]
*Book 2: View of [[Haweswater Reservoir|Haweswater]] from [[Harter Fell (Mardale)|Harter Fell]]
*Book 3: View of [[Thirlmere]] from [[Raven Crag]]
*Book 4: View of the Pinnacle, [[Scafell]]
*Book 5: [[Binsey]] summit with "ancient Briton" (i.e. the author)
*Book 6: View of [[High Stile]] from Lanthwaite Hill
*Book 7: View of [[Yewbarrow]] from Gatherstone Head

In the notes at the end of Book 7, Wainwright lists what he considers to be the 'finest half-dozen' fells in Lakeland. His list consists of:

* [[Scafell Pike]]
* [[Bowfell]]
* [[Pillar (Lake District)|Pillar]]
* [[Great Gable]]
* [[Blencathra]]
* [[Crinkle Crags]]

A 50th anniversary edition and a box set of the original edition have been published. Leather bound versions can be found secondhand.

==Second editions==
Between 2005 and 2009, the series was factually revised by the publishers [[Frances Lincoln Publishers|Frances Lincoln]], to adjust the content to the present-day Lake District. [[Chris Jesty]] undertook the revisions, using an imitation of Wainwright's hand lettering to make the alterations look as unobtrusive as possible. The most notable changes are that the covers of the revised books show photographs of the Lake District by Derry Brabbs, rather than the drawings that were on the covers of the originals, and the maps show the main paths in red.

The books, with the ISBNs of the revised editions, are:

*Book 1 — ''The Eastern Fells'' (2005) {{ISBN|0-7112-2454-4}}
*Book 2 — ''The Far Eastern Fells'' (2005) {{ISBN|0-7112-2455-2}}
*Book 3 — ''The Central Fells'' (2006) {{ISBN|0-7112-2456-0}}
*Book 4 — ''The Southern Fells'' (2007) {{ISBN|0-7112-2457-9}}
*Book 5 — ''The Northern Fells'' (2008) {{ISBN|0-7112-2458-7}}
*Book 6 — ''The Northwestern Fells'' (2008) {{ISBN|0-7112-2459-5}}
*Book 7 — ''The Western Fells'' (2009) {{ISBN|0-7112-2460-9}}

Revised editions of Wainwright's other Pictorial Guides, ''A Coast to Coast Walk'', ''[[The Outlying Fells of Lakeland]]'' and ''Pennine Way Companion'' were published between 2010 and 2012, with the amendments again being made by [[Chris Jesty]]. Revised editions of ''Walks in Limestone Country'' and ''Walks on the [[Howgill Fells]]'' were published in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ratcliffe|first1=Roger|title=On the Dales trail of a true pioneer|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/features/on-the-dales-trail-of-a-true-pioneer-1-6575772|website=Yorkshire Post|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third editions ==
{{asof|2014|lc}} a third edition of the guides, known as the Walkers Edition, is being prepared by Clive Hutchby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=Anna|title=Updating the Wainwright walking books will be a labour of love for Clive|url=http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/news/10911991.Updating_the_Wainwright_walking_books_will_be_a_labour_of_love_for_Clive/|website=Westmorland Gazette|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Book One: The Eastern Fells was published in March 2015; Book Two: The Far Eastern Fells was published in October 2015. Book Three: The Central Fells, was published in March 2016. Books Four, Five, Six and Seven will follow in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2019 respectively.

==Wainwright bagging==
The 214 fells included in the series are now generally known as 'the [[list of Wainwrights|Wainwrights]]'. These range in height from 985 feet ([[Castle Crag]]) to 3210 feet ([[Scafell Pike]]). Completing all the Wainwrights is a popular [[peak bagging]] challenge. The Wainwrights differ from other bagging lists such as the [[Munro]]s and [[Marilyn (geography)|Marilyn]]s, however, in that Wainwright never set out to compile such a list himself, and inclusion is not based on objective criteria such as elevation or [[Topographic prominence|prominence]].

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Hollinger was born in rural [[Chapman, Kansas]], and lived there through his high school years. After high school, he purchased a [[Harley-Davidson]] [[motorcycle]] and [[camera]], then proceeded to travel the Midwest earning money for gas and food by selling photos he took along the way.

In 1905, Hollinger married and in the same year enrolled at [[McPherson College]] in [[McPherson, Kansas]]. He played [[college football|football]] and [[baseball]] for the [[McPherson Bulldogs]] until he graduated in 1912 with a liberal arts degree.

In 1914, Hollinger and his family moved to [[Concordia, Kansas]], to accept the position of teacher of applied sciences at [[Concordia Junior-Senior High School]] where he created the Industrial Arts program.  In 1933 he retired from his teaching job to become self-employed running a service station and operated a secondhand store as a sideline in the basement of a local [[grocer]].  In 1939, Pop transitioned to selling mainly periodicals and comic books. Pop Hollinger ran his used comic book store from 1939 until 1971. Pop bought and sold old comic books throughout the Golden Age and Silver Age.  During World War II, Pop was asked to return to high school teaching as many of the instructors had joined the fight.

===Comic books===

Hollinger entered into the comics trade through his retail store and expanded into mail order. Originally a side business, he became so successful that he began working on ways to trade comics and began experimenting with restorative methods.&lt;ref name="Gailliet" /&gt; His restoring attempts included using tape and staples&lt;ref name="CBGExtra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbgxtra.com/blogs/beautiful-balloons/have-you-heard-of-pop-hollingers-comics|publisher=[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]|accessdate=April 29, 2011|title=Have you heard of Pop Hollinger’s comics?|date=August 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were primarily done to enhance the longevity of the reading experience rather than to boost the collector value. Hollinger referred to this process as 'rebuilding' and to the comic books as 'rebuilt comics'.

===Inventions===
Hollinger held several patents, including a Tray Dispenser (patent 4323168), a method and apparatus for dispensing flexible trays.&lt;ref name="patent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN%2F3695484|title=Patent number: 3695484, Method and apparatus for dispensing flexible trays|work=TRAY DISPENSER|publisher=[[United States Patent Office]]|accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Popeye]] and long-time [[girlfriend]], [[Olive Oyl]], are married and have a son named Popeye Junior (or Junior for short),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CHARLES SOLOMON |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-09/entertainment/ca-8568_1_cartoon-series |title=Kidvid Reviews : Cartoon Debuts Are All Drawn Out - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1987-10-09 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has inherited Popeye's ability to gain [[superhuman strength]] from eating [[spinach]]; however, Popeye Jr. hates the taste of spinach (preferring hamburgers, like Wimpy), much to his father's disappointment, although he eats spinach anyway to boost his strength. Popeye's long-time rival [[Bluto]] has a wife of his own and they also have a son named Tank. Like old times, Popeye and Bluto are rivals, as are their sons.

==Reception==
In 2014, including it in an article about twelve 1980s cartoons that supposedly did not deserve remembrance, ''[[io9]]'' was largely critical of the series, noting that it did not utilize the conventions established by the theatrical ''Popeye'' short films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bricken|first1=Rob|title=12 Cartoons From The 1980s No One Will Ever Have Nostalgia For|url=http://io9.com/12-cartoons-from-the-1980s-no-one-will-ever-have-nosta-1657410102|accessdate=11 September 2016|work=io9|date=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DVD release==
In late 2008, [[Warner Home Video]] planned to release four ''Popeye and Son'' episodes (8 cartoons) on [[DVD]] as ''Popeye &amp; Friends Volume Two'' (''Volume One'', released earlier in 2008, contained episodes of the previous Hanna-Barbera ''Popeye'' series, ''[[The All New Popeye Hour]]''). The release was cancelled following poor sales of the first volume, but Warner did release it in Australia on Region 4 DVD. The region 4 disc contains the following cartoons: "Attack of the Sea Hag", "Happy Anniversary", "The Sea Monster", "Poopdeck Pappy and the Family Tree", "Junior's Genie", "Mighty Olive at the Bat", "Junior Gets a Job", and "Surf Movie".

A collection of episodes has been released in the UK by Hollywood DVD Ltd. The cartoons on the DVD are: "Attack of the Sea Hag", "Happy Anniversary", "The Sea Monster", "Poopdeck Pappy and the Family Tree", "Bluto's Wave Pool", "Here Today Goon Tomorrow", "Don't Give Up the Picnic", "Lost Treasure of Pirate's Cove", "Junior's Genie", "Mighty Olive at the Bat", "Split Decision", and "The Case of the Burger Burglar".

'''''Rogue Legacy''''' is a 2013 [[platform game]] with [[roguelike]] elements developed by [[Cellar Door Games]].

== Gameplay ==

The goal of ''Rogue Legacy'' is to explore a randomly generated [[Dungeon crawl|dungeon]], defeat four [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]]es in each of the four unique environments of the dungeon, and then defeat the final boss. Characters have the default ability to jump and slash with their sword, along with secondary abilities, such as magic attacks, which use [[Magic points|mana]].&lt;ref name="Destructoid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-rogue-legacy-256914.phtml |title=Review: Rogue Legacy |first=Patrick |last=Hancock |date=June 27, 2013 |work= |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |accessdate=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whenever a character dies as a result of losing all of their Hit Points (HP), control will transfer over to one of three randomly generated heirs which the player may choose between, though this number may be increased to six with a later upgrade. Each descendant carries their unique characteristics and abilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/06/28/rogue-legacy-out-now-a-2d-roguelike-about-heroism-and-genealogy/ |title=Rogue Legacy out now: a 2D roguelike about heroism and genealogy |first=Phil |last=Savage |date=June 28, 2013 |work= |publisher=[[PC Gamer]] |quote= Traits include dyslexia, tourette's and irritable bowel syndrome, among others.  |accessdate=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; including such genetic peculiarities as [[color-blind]]ness (in which the game is presented in black and white), [[ADHD]] (in which the player moves faster) and [[dwarfism]] (in which the character is short and can fit into small gaps).

Gold found while exploring the castle can be used to improve the character's equipment and abilities, which are passed on to that character's heirs. Gold can be found by smashing pieces of furniture, opening chests, or defeating enemies. There are also various fairy chests hidden in special rooms throughout the castle, most of which require the player to complete an objective, such as taking no damage in the room, in order to be opened.

Spending gold on the manor, which appears after a new heir is chosen, can increase stats, such as health and mana, and unlock and upgrade new classes that may be carried by one of the heirs. These include mages, which can use more advanced spells, warriors, who have higher strength, and assassins, who can use various stealth techniques and have an increased likelihood of having a critical hit.

Gold can unlock the blacksmith, the enchantress and the architect, who each provide their own services. The blacksmith can use blueprints found in the castle to create new armor and equipment for the player, improving their stats. Similarly, the enchantress can use runes found in fairy chests to give the player enhancements, unlocking additional abilities such as double jumping and dashing. Finally, the architect can lock down the design of a previously encountered castle (so that a new one isn't randomly generated) in exchange for a percentage of any gold found.

Any unspent gold must be paid to [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] in order to enter the castle, though upgrades can reduce the amount required to pay.

=== Additional content ===

The game features a progressing "New Game +" feature, in which every completion of the game along a specific line of descendants increases the difficulty while also increasing the rewards offered by enemies and chests. After the second completion, the format for the name is "New Game +n" where n is the number of playthroughs since the first (Begins at +2, then +3, etc.). Notably, while enemies increase in difficulty theoretically forever, bosses do not get any harder across playthroughs. Furthermore, the player cannot normally increase in power beyond a certain point, though small increases to various stats beyond this soft-cap are possible through the "Fairy Chests" system.

A number of secret bosses exist, all of which are remixed versions of each of the ordinary bosses.&lt;ref name="thegemsbok"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/mid-week-mission-rogue-legacy-cellar-door-games/|title=Turned Up to 11: ''Rogue Legacy''‘s Remix Bosses and the Virtues of Nonlinear Difficulty Scaling|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=January 20, 2016|website=The Gemsbok|publisher=|access-date=April 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon defeating all of the secret ordinary bosses, one may challenge the secret version of the final boss in order to unlock the secret "Traitor" class, based on the first form of the final boss.

== Development ==

The game was developed by Cellar Door Games, a [[Toronto]]-based developer consisting of brothers Kenny and Teddy Lee. This was the brothers' biggest project to date and took 18 months to develop.&lt;!--EurogamerMakingOf--&gt; The game was inspired by such titles as ''[[Demon's Souls]]'' and ''[[Dark Souls]]''.&lt;!--EurogamerMakingOf--&gt; Teddy compares the design to games like ''[[Spelunky]]'' and [[The Binding of Isaac (video game)|''The Binding of Isaac'']], noting that their goal was to make the game relatively forgiving and accessible, while also allowing permanent progression.&lt;!--EurogamerMakingOf--&gt;&lt;ref name="thegemsbok" /&gt; Due to the need to streamline the game, several prominent features were cut during development, including an experience system.&lt;!--EurogamerMakingOf--&gt; Kenny added that the revenue from the game will allow them to focus on larger future projects.&lt;ref name="EurogamerMakingOf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-07-29-the-making-of-rogue-legacy |title=The making of Rogue Legacy |last=Stanton |first=Rich |date=July 29, 2013 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network |accessdate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game cost the team about $15,000 of their own money to develop, all of which was earned back within an hour of release. ''Rogue Legacy'' went on to sell more than 100,000 copies within the first week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.vg247.com/2014/03/18/rogue-legacy-turned-a-profit-within-an-hour-on-sale/ | title = Rogue Legacy turned a profit within an hour on sale | first = Mike | last = Irving | date = March 17, 2014|  accessdate = March 17, 2014 | publisher = [[VG247]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most versions of the game were done in-house. However, the Xbox One version was ported by [[Abstraction Games]].

== Release ==
In December 2014, Cellar Door Games teamed up with [[IndieBox]], a monthly [[subscription box]] service, to produce an exclusive physical release of ''Rogue Legacy''. This limited, individually-numbered collector’s edition included a flash-drive with a [[DRM-Free|DRM-free]] game file, the official soundtrack, an instruction manual and [[Steam (software)|Steam]] key, as well as several custom-designed collectible items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cellardoorgames.com/rogue-legacy-indie-box/|title=Cellar Door Games|website=cellardoorgames.com|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thatvideogameblog.com/2015/01/08/review-indiebox-rogue-legacy/|title=REVIEW / Indiebox (Rogue Legacy)|date=2015-01-08|website=That VideoGame Blog|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nintendo Switch]] version of ''Rogue Legacy'' is expected to be released on November 6, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-10-23-brilliant-genealogical-platformer-rogue-legacy-is-out-on-switch-next-month | title = Brilliant genealogical platformer Rogue Legacy launches on Switch next month | first = Matt | last = Wales | date = October 23, 2018 | accessdate = October 23, 2018 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Santa Claus and His Old Lady'''" is a [[Sketch comedy|bit]] by [[Cheech and Chong]], one of their best-known comedy routines. It was the duo's first single.

"Santa Claus and His Old Lady" did not appear on the duo's [[Cheech and Chong (album)|eponymous debut album]], although the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], "Dave," did. It has since received continued airplay on radio stations during the Christmas season, particularly those that switch to temporary all-Christmas music formats. It peaked at number 4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Christmas Singles chart upon its release in 1971, then peaked again at number 3 on the same chart in 1972 and 1973. (Entries on any given week's Christmas Singles chart were ineligible for the corresponding edition of the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] at the time.)

==Synopsis==
The sketch begins with Cheech at the piano attempting to write a parody of "[[¿Dónde Está Santa Claus?]]" (Spanish for "Where is Santa Claus?") a Christmas song by Augie Rios from 1958, to little success. Chong enters, at which point he reveals that he has never heard of [[Santa Claus]] (Chong repeatedly mistakes Santa Claus for a musician).

Cheech then explains the story of Santa Claus, but from an unusual perspective. Santa and his wife began in [[Housing project|the projects]], after which, in no small part due to a combination of excessive noise from "pounding and hammering all night" and the [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-infused brownies for which [[Mrs. Claus]] became known, they were driven out and formed a [[commune]] at the North Pole with a large group of [[Christmas elf|midgets]]. Cheech explains that the reason Santa's sleigh can fly is because he "took the [[Controlled-access highway|freeway]]" and liberally used "[[Phencyclidine|magic dust]]" and that uncomfortable experiences with [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]] and [[Redneck|Southerners]] who threatened to cut off his hair and beard prompted him to go [[underground economy|underground]]. According to Cheech, Santa Claus now [[undercover operation|works undercover]] as a [[Salvation Army]] bell-ringer, at which point Chong once again, and more certainly this time, asserts he really had played music with Santa Claus.

In contrast to most of their other sketches, Cheech and Chong play fictionalized versions of themselves in this bit. (Chong himself was a musician before beginning his collaboration with Cheech, most prominently as a songwriter and vocalist for [[Bobby Taylor &amp; the Vancouvers]] in the late 1960s; he somewhat fictionalizes this in the song, however, stating not that he is from his real hometown of Vancouver, but instead from [[Pittsburgh]].)

==B-side==
The B-side was "Dave," one of the duo's earliest and most famous sketches. In this sketch, a man named Dave (Cheech), who is apparently on the run from the police, attempts to enter the locked apartment of his roommate (Chong), who will not answer the door. As Dave repeatedly tries to identify himself, the roommate instead thinks he is asking for Dave, and replies "Dave's not here."

The show was launched in August 2016 on [[Major League Wrestling|MLW Radio]]. The episodes typically range from 2 hours to 4 hours in length, and include discussions about previous WWE [[pay-per-view]]s and former WWE wrestlers. A video version of the podcast called ''Something Else to Wrestle with Bruce Prichard'' debuted on the [[WWE Network]] on April 18, 2018. Season one has 13 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/wrestling/2018/04/07/bruce-prichard-conrad-thompson-wwe-network-show |title=Bruce Prichard and Conrad Thompson Show Set to Debut This Month on WWE Network|author=JUSTIN BARRASSO |date=April 7, 2018 |website=si.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The podcast is co-hosted by Conrad Thompson. Thompson sits down with Bruce Prichard, a former WWE executive who performed on camera and was behind the scenes with the company for over twenty years. Each week, Thompson and Prichard discuss a new topic which is typically a particular WWE event, WWE happening or WWE character. Prichard discusses his experiences and recalls the topic of the episode from his perspective. The topic is voted on by the fans through [[Facebook]] or [[Twitter]]. Occasionally, Thompson and Prichard will determine the topic schedule in advance.

==Reception==
In 2017, ''Something to Wrestle with Bruce Prichard'' won two awards. The Academy of Podcasters named the podcast its Sports &amp; Recreation podcast of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academyofpodcasters.com/congratulations-2017-winners/ |title=CONGRATULATIONS TO THE 2017 WINNERS! |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=August 28, 2017 |website=academyofpodcasters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Sports Illustrated]] named the podcast its Sports Podcast of the Year in its annual Sports Media Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/tech-media/2017/12/17/sports-illustrated-media-awards-best-worst-2017-tony-romo-espn |title=Sports Illustrated Media Awards: The Best and Worst of 2017|author=Richard Deitsch |date=December 17, 2017 |website=si.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-offs==
On January 30, 2017, Thompson launched a second show with [[Tony Schiavone]] titled [[What Happened When]] available on MLW Radio discussing stories from [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] and [[WCW]].

In April 2018, another spin-off launched with Thompson and [[Eric Bischoff]] known as ''83 weeks''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/83Weeks/about/?ref=page_internal|title=83weeks|work=www.facebook.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Prichard and Thompson began doing a show for the WWE Network titled ''Something Else to Wrestle with Bruce Prichard''. The show has the same format as the original podcast, the only difference between the two being ''Something Else to Wrestle'' will be a video version of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.prowrestlingsheet.com/bruce-prichard-wwe-network/|title="Something Else to Wrestle With Bruce Prichard" Coming to WWE Network|date=2018-04-06|work=Pro Wrestling Sheet {{!}} Insider Wrestling News and Reports|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first episode was on April 18, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/PrichardShow/status/985994344174940161?s=19|title=Something to Wrestle with Bruce Prichard on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tarocchini''' (plural for ''tarocchino'') are point [[trick-taking]] [[tarot card games]] originating from the 17th century. They are the diminutive form of ''tarocchi'' (plural for ''tarocco''), referring to the reduction of the [[Tarocco Bolognese|Bolognese pack]] from 78 to 62 cards, which probably occurred in the early 16th century.

The games are popular in the [[Bologna]] region of [[Italy]] and has been confined mostly to this area. Tarocchini are very complex games, yet the rules have changed little over the years.

==Deck description==
Tarocchini can be played with a 78-card Tarot deck (where the 2–5 pip cards in each suit have been removed), though normally, a special Tarot deck, the [[Tarocco Bolognese]] is used. The trump cards have a unique ordering where the second to fifth trumps are known collectively as the '''''Moretti''''' (Moors) and are of equal rank (the last one played is the highest, in regards to taking a trick).  In the Tarocco Bolognese, these cards are depicted with four Moors, two of which are identical.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|last2=McLeod|first2=John|title=A History of Games Played with the Tarot Pack|date=2004|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|location=Lewiston|pages=257-314|ref=History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Fool (Tarot card)|The Fool]] is not a trump, it cannot beat any cards and is played as an excuse from [[Follow suit|following suit]].  The [[The Magician (Tarot card)|Magician]] is the lowest trump. However, both the Fool and the Magician may be used as '''''contatori''''' (counters or [[Wild card (card games)|wild cards]]) to assist in making sequences. The ''contatori'' are very valuable, because they can be used as wild cards in multiple locations. The four highest trumps, which are unnumbered, are Angel, World, Sun, and Moon and they are collectively known as '''''grande''''' (big). Angel, World, Magician, and the Fool are collectively known as '''''tarocchi'''''.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, John. [https://www.pagat.com/tarot/ottocen.html Ottocento] at [[pagat.com]]. Retrieved 1 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Note'': Grande, the four Moors, the Magician, and the Fool are not numbered in present day Bologna tarot decks.''

The cards won by each side are counted in pairs, with 1 being subtracted from the total for each pair. There are also six points for winning the final trick, giving a total of 93 points.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

==Common rules==
In tarocchini, card points are not as important as bonus or meld points gained from combinations. Combinations can either be associative or sequential. Associative combinations or ''cricche'' (formerly as ''pariglie'') consist of three or four of a kind sets.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

{|class=wikitable

|-
|Kings||17||34
|-
|Queens||14||28
|-
|Cavaliers||13||26
|-
|Jacks||12||24
|}
	
There are four types of sequential combinations although two of them are more like associative combinations. Each sequence needs at least three cards for 10 points and every extra card is worth 5 points. What separates the sequences from the ''cricche'' is the use of the ''contatori''. The ''contatori'' may not be used to substitute Angel or a King. For trumps, the sequence ends if the ''contatori'' are used consecutively with one exception: if the two cards replaced are trump 16 and a ''grande''.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; 
{|class=wikitable
!'''Sequence'''!!'''Minimum requirement'''!!'''Extra cards'''
|-
|Trumps||Angel and at least two of the next three ''grande'' (one of which mustn't be a wild card)||Consecutive numbered trumps
|-
|Suits||King and at least two face cards of the same suit (one of which mustn't be a wild card)||Ace of the same suit
|-
|Moors||Two Moors plus a third Moor which can be a wild card||Up to six Moors with wild cards
|-
|Aces||Two Aces plus a third Ace which can be a wild card||Up to six Aces with wild cards
|}

Multiplicative bonuses occur when three or more cricche or three or more sequences are made at one time. This doubles the points.

==Variations==
The four-player version of this game, Ottocento, is the most popular version.

===Ottocento===
Ottocento is played by 4 players in two partnerships sitting opposite each other. The middle part of the game is very similar to the basic tarot game. It adds a round of point-counting before and after the game based on sets and runs of the cards. An unusual feature is that the partners are allowed to make certain limited signals to each other during play.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

As usual for Tarot card games, dealing and card play are counter-clockwise. The dealer gives 15 cards to each player, in 3 rounds of five cards apiece. The dealer takes the last two cards into his hand. The dealer has to discard two cards, which can not be "5 point" cards (such as kings, or the trumps worth 5 points). The cards that the dealer discards are counted as points to his side, unless he and his partner capture no tricks at all during the card play in which case the discarded cards must be surrendered to the opponents.

After the first 5 cards have been dealt, if all players agree the game may ''andare a monte''. If this happens, all the cards are thrown in, and the deal passes to the next player. The first player speaks first, declaring a monte if he wishes to restart the game. This continues with each player until it reaches the dealer. If all have declared a monte, then the game will be restarted.

The game consists of three parts.  Just after the hand has been dealt, all players may score their hands according to the meld points contained within.  Next, normal card play occurs.  Finally, the partners score any [[Meld (cards)|meld points]] that they have in their captured tricks. The scoring of meld points after card play is unique to Tarocchini and [[Minchiate]].

====Declarations====
After the cards have been dealt, each player may declare certain combinations of cards that they hold in their hand to collect meld points.  They do not have to declare anything, and may optionally declare a smaller set or run than they actually have.  Anything that is declared must be placed face-up on the table. The decision of what to declare is an interesting strategic choice.

====Game play====
Once the first declaration of points is finished, normal card play ensues. Note that some information has been disclosed by the declarations, so players will have more clues than usual as to the contents of the other players' hands. As in all tarocchi games, there is the rule that a player that can't [[follow suit]] must trump if possible. If lacking trumps, then any card can be discarded. The Fool excuses the player from following suit: it is played to the trick instead of following suit, and then retrieved to its player's pile of won tricks. The Fool's player gives a low valued card to the trick's winner (only if it is an opponent) at the end of the hand. If the Fool's team failed to win any trick, the Fool is surrendered to the opponents but this is very rare. One of the most important strategies is to capture or protect the Begato as it is very useful in scoring. The last trick has a bonus of 6 points.

During the actual card play, the eldest is permitted to make certain signals to his partner. The current game allows only three signals:
*Eldest can throw his card up to let his partner know that he is now void of this suit. Originally, the signal was opening a hand.
*Player draws back the card towards himself to let his partner know that she should lead with trumps.
*Eldest knocks the table with a fist to let his partner know that she should win with her highest card and lead the next trick with the same suit. 

These are some of the formerly allowed signals:
*When a player has the lead, he may instruct his partner to lead his highest trump by saying ''sminchiate''.
*If the player strikes the centre of the table, that indicates he has the highest card of the suit (including trumps). Striking the table's edge means holding the second highest.
*If leading, the player may draw back the card slightly toward himself before laying it down, signaling that the partner should not play her highest card of the suit.

====Scoring====
Once all tricks have been completed, the captured cards are examined for meld points. Combine these meld points with the meld points from declared at the beginning of the hand. Next, count card points in pairs with one point subtracted from each pair. Then add the last trick bonus. After adding the meld points with the card points and last trick bonus, the first team to reach 800 wins. It is actually possible to win at the declarations if one team can reach 800 points. If both teams can do it, the team with the higher points win.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

'''Television in the Soviet Union''' was owned, controlled and [[Censorship in the Soviet Union|censored]] by the [[state (polity)|state]]. The body governing television in the era of the  [[Soviet Union]] was the [[Gosteleradio]] committee, which was responsible for both the [[Soviet Central Television]] and the [[Radio in the Soviet Union|All-Union Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovbusiness.ru/pravo/DocumShow_DocumID_38511.html О РЕСПУБЛИКАНСКИХ МИНИСТЕРСТВАХ И ГОСУДАРСТВЕННЫХ КОМИТЕТАХ РСФСР. Закон. Верховный Совет РСФСР. 14.07.90 101-1 :: Инновации и предпринимательство: гранты, технологии, патенты&lt;!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом --&gt;] In Russian.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet television production was classified into central ([[Soviet Central Television]]), [[Republics of the Soviet Union|republican]], and regional [[broadcasting]].

==History==
In 1938, television [[broadcasting]] began in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] under the auspices of the All-Union Committee for Radiofication and Radio Broadcasting at the USSR [[Sovnarkom]] (Всесоюзный комитет по радиофикации и радиовещанию при СНК СССР).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consultant.ru/online/base/?req=doc;base=LAW;n=28980 Указ Президента РСФСР от 28.11.1991 № 242 «О реорганизации центральных органов государственного управления РСФСР»] In Russian.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 1934, Russia's first televisions were produced. They had a 3 × 9 [[Centimetre|cm]] screen and a mechanical [[Raster scan]] in 30 lines at 12.5 frames per second. On 15 November 1934, [[Moscow]] had its first television broadcast. It was a concert. Then, on 15 October 1935, the first film was broadcast. 

On 9 March 1938, a first experimental studio television program was broadcast from [[Shabolovka tower]] in [[Moscow]]. Three weeks later, the first full film, ''[[The Great Citizen]]'' (Великий гражданин) was broadcast. On 7 June 1938, a television broadcast was trialled in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]].

[[World war II]] disrupted regular television broadcasting until it was re-instated in [[Moscow]] on 15 December 1945. On 4 November 1948, the Moscow television centre adopted a new 625 line standard. On 29 June 1949, the first out of studio broadcast of a [[Association football|football]] match was broadcast live from the [[Dynamo (sports society)|Dynamo]] sports stadium. On 24 August 1950, a long range broadcast was made from [[Moscow]] to [[Ryazan]]. 

In time for the golden jubilee year of the [[October Revolution]] in 1967, colour broadcasts debuted in both Moscow and Leningrad on their respective local TV channels. By 1973, the Soviet television service grew into six full national channels, plus republican and regional stations serving all republics and minority communities.

==Distance and geography==
The size and [[geography]] of the [[Soviet Union]] made television broadcasting difficult. These factors included mountains such as the [[Urals]], the [[Taiga]] and the [[Steppes]] and the encompassing of eleven different [[time zones]]. For instance, a program broadcast at 18:00 in [[Moscow]] would be shown at 21:00 in [[Bishkek|Frunze]], [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghizia]]. The [[population density]] was irregular with many more residents found in the west. The [[Soviet Union]] was also relaying broadcasts to other [[Warsaw Pact]] states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovbusiness.ru/pravo/DocumShow_DocumID_56082.html ОБ УТВЕРЖДЕНИИ ПОЛОЖЕНИЯ О МИНИСТЕРСТВЕ ПЕЧАТИ И ИНФОРМАЦИИ РОССИЙСКОЙ ФЕДЕРАЦИИ. Постановление Правительства РФ от 18.05.93 № 473] in Russian.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet television standard==
The Soviet broadcast television standard used [[Broadcast television systems#ITU identification scheme|System D]] ([[OIRT]] [[Television channel frequencies#Eastern Europe|VHF band]] with the "R" channels ranging from R1 to R12) and System K (pan-European/African [[UHF]] band), with [[SECAM]] as the color system standard. The resulting system is commonly referred to as "SECAM D/K".

==Soviet television channels==
There were six [[television channel]]s (called "programmes") in the Soviet Union. The "First Programme" was the main channel with time slots for regional programming. (see [[#Regional television services]] below). The other channels included the All Union Programme (the second channel), the Moscow Programme (the third channel), the Fourth Programme (the fourth channel), the Fifth programme (broadcast from Leningrad) and the Sixth Programme (sports, science and technology).

Not all channels were available across the [[Soviet Union]]. Until [[perestroika]] and the establishment of the [[Gorizont]] satellite network, many regions only had access to the First Programme and the All Union Programme. The new satellite network had enough transponders for all five channels to be carried to the entire Soviet Union. This increased the variation of television programmes offered. the new channels offered urban news and entertainment (Channel 3); culture, documentaries and programmes for the [[Intelligentsia]] (Channel 4) and information and entertainment from the point of view of another city (Channel 5).

==Regional television services==
In addition to the national television channels, each of the [[Republics of the Soviet Union]] (RSS) and [[Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics of the Soviet Union]] (ARSS) had its own state radio and television company or state broadcasting committees. The regional company or committee was able to broadcast regional programming in [[Russian language|Russian]]  or the local language alongside the official First Programme schedule. The regional company or committee was able to broadcast additional channels for their coverage area only.

==Soviet satellite services==
The Soviet Union's domestic [[Satellite television|satellite television system]], [[Orbita (TV system)|Orbita]], was as large as [[Canada]]'s [[Anik (satellite)|Anik]]  and the [[United States|U.S.]]'s satellite system. 

In 1990, there were 90 Orbita satellites, supplying programming to 900 main transmitters and over 4,000 relay stations. The best known Soviet satellites were the [[Molniya (satellite)|Molniya]] (or "Lightning") satellites. Other satellite groups were named the [[Gorizont]] ("Horizon"), Ekran ("Screen"), and Statsionar ("Stationary") satellites. People residing outside the Soviet Union who used a [[TVRO]] satellite television could receive Soviet broadcasts.

Broadcasts were [[time-shifting|time-shifted]] to counter the problems of the Soviet Union's geography and time zones. The national television channels were only on the air for part of the day giving room in the schedule to time-shift. There were two types of Soviet time-shifting, one based on a similar radio programme, and "Double" programs, which was composite time-shifting for the different time zones. 

Only the First Programme was time-shifted based on the pattern of a similar radio programme, the All-Union First Programme from Soviet radio. TV Orbita-1 was broadcast in time zones [[UTC]] +11, +12, and +13 time zones. TV Orbita-2 was broadcast in time zones UTC +9 and +10 time zones, TV Orbita-3 in UTC +7 and +8 time zones, TV Orbita-4 in UTC +5 and +6 and the First Programme in time zones UTC +2, +3, and +4.  

All other national television channels (the All-Union, Moscow, Fourth and Leningrad Programmes) used the "Double" program composite time-shifting format.

==Programming==
Soviet TV programming was diverse. It was similar to that of American [[PBS]]. It included news programmes, educational programmes, documentaries, occasional movies, and children's programmes. Major sports events such as [[soccer]] and [[ice hockey]] matches were often broadcast live. Programming was domestic or made in [[Warsaw Pact]] countries.

The broadcasts had high levels of self-censorship. There were obvious state-mandated restrictions such as prohibition of any form of criticism of Soviet government. Other taboo topics included all aspects of [[erotica]], [[Nudity in television|nudity]], [[Graphic  violence|graphic portrayal of violence]] and [[Profanity|coarse language]] and [[Recreational drug use|illicit drug use]]. [[Religion]] was either portrayed in a critical light or avoided.

The leading news programmes used presenters with exemplary diction and excellent knowledge of the [[Russian language]]. [[Sergey Georgyevich Lapin]], chairman of the USSR State Committee for Television and Radio (1970 to 1985) made a number of rules. Male presenters could not have beards and had to wear a tie and jacket. Women were not allowed to wear pants. Lapin banned a broadcast of a [[close up]] of [[Alla Pugacheva]] singing into the microphone, as he considered it reminiscent of oral sex. Lapin and his committee were accused of [[anti-semitism]] in the television programming.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}.

Despite these limitations, television grew in popularity. The average daily volume of broadcasting grew from 1673 hours in 1971 to 3,700 hours in 1985. A new television and radio complex, the "PTRC" was built for the 1980 [[Moscow Olympics]]. The [[Ostankino Technical Center]] in [[Moscow]] was one of the largest at that time. 

In the late 1980s, the nature of programming began to change. Some Western programs, mostly from the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Latin America]], were imported. [[Talk show]]s and [[game show]]s were introduced, often copied from their western counterparts. For example, the game show, ''[[Pole Chudes]]'' (''The Field of Miracles'') based on ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''. Free speech regulations were gradually eased.

Until the late 1980s, Soviet television had no advertisements. Even then, they were rare, because few companies could produce advertisements about themselves.

The Soviet Union's [[television news]] was provided by the [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union]] (TASS).

===Made-for-TV movies===
In the beginning of the 1960s television in the USSR was expanding rapidly. The increase in the number of channels and the duration of daily broadcast caused shortage of content deemed suitable for broadcast. This led to production of [[television film]]s, in particular of ''multiple-episode television films'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: '''многосерийный телевизионный фильм''')—the official Soviet moniker for [[miniseries]].&lt;ref name="sovtelefilm"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that the Soviet Union started broadcasting in color in 1967, color TV sets did not become widespread until the end of the 1980s. This justified shooting made-for-TV movies on black-and-white film.

The 1965 four-episode ''[[:ru:Вызываем огонь на себя (фильм)|Calling for fire, danger close]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered the first Soviet miniseries. It is a period drama set in the Second World War depicting the Soviet guerrilla fighters infiltrating German compound and directing the fire of the regular Soviet Army to destroy the German airfield. During the 1970s the straightforward fervor gave way to a more nuanced interplay of patriotism, family and everyday life wrapped into traditional genres of crime drama, spy show or thriller. One of the most popular Soviet miniseries—''[[Seventeen Moments of Spring]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; about a Soviet spy operating in Nazi Germany—was shot in 1972. This 12-episode miniseries  incorporated features of political thriller and [[docudrama]] and included excerpts from period newsreels. Originally produced in black-and-white in 4:3 aspect ratio, it was colorized and re-formatted for wide-screen TVs in 2009. 

Other popular miniseries of the Soviet era include ''The Shadows Disappear at Noon''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1971, 7 episodes) about the fate of several generations of locals from a Siberian village, ''[[The Meeting Place Cannot Be Changed]]'' (1979, 5 episodes) about the fight against criminals in the immediate post-war period, and ''[[TASS Is Authorized to Declare...]]'' (1984, 10 episodes) about the tug-of-war of Soviet and American intelligence agencies.

Numerous miniseries were produced for children in the 1970s-1980s. Among them are: ''[[The Adventures of Buratino (1976 film)|The Adventures of Buratino]]'' (1976, 2 episodes)—an adaptation of ''[[The Golden Key, or the Adventures of Buratino]]'' by [[Alexey Tolstoy]], which in turn is a retelling of ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' by [[Carlo Collodi]]; ''The Two Captains''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1976, 6 episodes)—an adaptation of ''[[The Two Captains]]'' by [[Veniamin Kaverin]] about a search for a lost Arctic expedition and the discovery of [[Severnaya Zemlya]]; ''[[The Adventures of the Elektronic|The Adventures of Elektronic]]'' (1979, 3 episodes) about a humanoid robot meeting and befriending his prototype—a 6-th grade schoolboy; ''[[Guest from the Future]]'' (1985, 5 episodes) about a boy and a girl travelling in time and fighting intergalactic criminals. In each of these, CTV-USSR co-produced them with the [[Gorky Film Studio]].

'''Time for prints''' (or '''trade for prints''', '''time for pics''', '''TFP''', and sometimes '''prints for time''', '''PFT''') is a term many photography communities use to describe an arrangement between a [[model (person)|model]] and a [[photographer]] whereby the photographer agrees to provide the model with a certain number of pictures of selected photographs from the session, and a release or license to use those pictures in return for the model's time. The word 'Time' refers a person's time spent during the photoshoot. The Word "Prints" refers to a physically printed photo, usually on photo paper. The foundation of the concept of TFP being that both a photographer and a model get together and exchange their 'time', for free, and each receives the photos for their own usage. Since photos can now be delivered by means other than 'Prints,' some variant wordings of this arrangement are: '''Time for CD''' or '''Trade for CD''' ('''TFCD'''). With TFCD, the photographer provides the selection of images on a [[Compact disc|CD]] instead of prints. Similarly, with the ease and convenience of digital high-resolution images, the generic term TF* has evolved, where it does not necessarily refer to a tangible CD or printed image since the same accepted rules apply.

There are benefits to both parties of such an arrangement. The model can build a portfolio of photographs to show to prospective clients at little or no cost, while the photographer gets a model for a particular project or his portfolio with little if any outlay of cash.

== Conditions ==
Each [[photo shoot]] arranged is usually negotiated separately, and the terms can vary widely. The number of pictures which the photographer delivers to the model can range from a single photograph up to all shots taken.&lt;ref name="macdonald 120"&gt;Macdonald, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Speed of delivery can vary as well, from a CD burned at the end of the shoot before the model leaves up to several months. Unless such a time period has been specifically discussed and agreed prior to the shoot, finished pictures ideally should be delivered within two weeks.&lt;ref name="macdonald 124"&gt;Macdonald, p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
Depending on local laws, a model or photographer might agree to limit or to 'not use' some of the pictures from a shoot. The model or photographer may agree to only use specifically agreed upon pictures (to avoid sub-standard pictures that damage the photographer's or model's reputation),&lt;ref name="macdonald 124"/&gt; or the photographer may agree to only use certain images in printed publications and not on the internet.&lt;ref name="macdonald 126"&gt;Macdonald, p.126&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal requirements for a [[model release]] vary from place to place and from situation to situation, as does the situation regarding [[copyright]]. For example, under the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]], a photographer in the [[United Kingdom]] can, subject to certain exclusions and unless specifically agreed to the contrary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=2250249|title=
Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (c. 48)|accessdate=14 July 2009|publisher=Office of Public Sector Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; use any photograph in any way he or she chooses, including selling them for profit. This does not necessarily apply in other countries. These issues should be discussed and agreed prior to the shoot, in writing if necessary.&lt;ref name="macdonald 127"&gt;Macdonald, p.127&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==
Negotiated compensation for a model's time can range from a straight cash figure, possibly including an amount for travel expenses or, depending on legal requirements, an extra amount for signing a model release, to a simple number of pictures in a chosen format. It can include part-pay, part-TFP arrangements&lt;ref name="macdonald 122"&gt;Macdonald, p.122&lt;/ref&gt; or "Time For Clothes" agreements where the model is given some or all of the clothing which was procured for the shoot.&lt;ref name="macdonald 125"&gt;Macdonald, p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

== Testing ==
While sometimes people use this term to mean TFP, agencies more commonly use it in the context of sending a new model to a photographer for a short session for portfolio pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Williams &amp; O'Connor, p.182&lt;/ref&gt; While the model ultimately pays for these pictures, the agency normally pays in advance and deducts it from the model's earnings.&lt;ref&gt;Williams &amp; O'Connor, p.183&lt;/ref&gt; Test shoots are also used by models to build experience.&lt;ref&gt;Williams &amp; O'Connor, p.174&lt;/ref&gt;
Test was also created by photographers to try out new ideas for final images to show a client, this is with no payment from either party.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

'''Trevor Ashley''' (born 27 February 1980) is an Australian musical theatre actor, cabaret and [[Drag queen|drag artist]] based in Sydney. He also has appeared on television in "The Very Trevor Ashley Show"

==Early life==
Ashley grew up in the south of Sydney and studied at the [[Shopfront]] a contemporary theatre. There he worked with Errol Bray, John Du Feu and playwright [[Hilary Bell (writer)|Hilary Bell]]. He appeared in ''Alice'' with [[Paul Capsis]], and in ''Peter Pan'' with screen actor [[Bryan Brown]]. He also played [[Jean Passepartout|Passepartout]] in their production of ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days]]''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Ashley attended [[Sydney Technical High School]] where he studied music and drama, played in the school bands and began writing orchestrations and arrangements. He was then chosen to be part of the [[Schools Spectacular]], and the Talent Development Project under the direction of Mary Lopez. He graduated from high school in 1997.

==Career==
===Cabaret===
Ashley made his professional debut in the Sydney Cabaret Convention 1998. His performance impressed both the critics and judges with the Cabaret Hotline calling him "A knockout performer… the clear crowd favourite and the only one to emulate a 'cabaret sensibility'". He then toured his show ''Trevor The Arena Mega Musical'' to New York's Don't Tell Mama and The Talk of London in England.

On return to Australia, he created the show ''Pop Princess'' with [[Phillip Scott (actor)|Phil Scott]]. He soon became "[[Sydney Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras]] Royalty"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/17/1045330537545.html |title=Mardi Gras royalty |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=18 February 2003 |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and followed up this with ''Pop Princess 2'', two years later in 2005.

''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert|Priscilla]]'' film director [[Stephan Elliott]] then chose Ashley to sing the theme song to his 2008 film ''[[Easy Virtue (2008 film)|Easy Virtue]]'', "[[Let's Misbehave]]". The film stars [[Colin Firth]], [[Jessica Biel]] and [[Kristin Scott Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.starobserver.com.au/entertainment/2009/03/25/trevors-turn-to-misbehave/5071 |title=Trevor’s turn to misbehave |publisher=Star Observer |date=25 March 2009 |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Ashley created and continued to host Showqueen, a weekly cabaret night at the Supper Club in Sydney. Showqueen featured special guests and notable cabaret performers, and also had a successful season in Melbourne. Previous guests have included [[Toni Lamond]], [[Iota (entertainer)|iOTA]], [[Virginia Gay]], [[Genevieve Lemon]] and [[Matthew Robinson (performer and composer)|Matthew Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianstage.com.au/reviews/melbourne/showqueen--trevor-ashley-2178.html |title=Showqueen &amp;#124; Trevor Ashley |publisher=Australian Stage Online |last=Mattarelli |first=Vito |date=19 January 2009 |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/arts/come-to-the-cabaret/2008/12/09/1228584833201.html |title=Come to the cabaret |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=10 December 2008 |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/music/your-tables-waiting--cabaret-is-back/2009/10/09/1255019613360.html | work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | title=Your table's waiting - cabaret is back | date=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Sydney Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras]] 2009, Ashley teamed with drag star [[Courtney Act]] to great acclaim in ''Gentlemen Prefer Blokes'', a bawdy revue style show that ran in Sydney twice, and also played the [[Adelaide Cabaret Festival]] and a season at [[His Majesty's Theatre, Perth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/double-trouble/2009/02/05/1233423373130.html |title=Double trouble |last=Dow |first=Steve |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date= 6 February 2009|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gentlemen Prefer Blokes'' had to be rewritten two weeks prior to the Sydney run after Courtney Act suffered a broken leg while skiing in Canada. Soap star [[Virginia Gay]] from Channel 7's ''[[All Saints (TV series)|All Saints]]'' joined the cast to play Courtney's body double.

''I'm Every Woman'', commissioned by the [[Sydney Opera House]], paid tribute to Ashley's favourite divas living and dead. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/sydney-opera-house/trevor-ashley-20100705-zwk0.html |title=Trevor Ashley |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=5 July 2010 |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was nominated for a Sydney Theatre Award for Best Cabaret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.aussietheatre.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1226:sydney-theatre-award-nominees&amp;catid=44:general&amp;Itemid=67 |title=The home of Australian Theatre |publisher=AussieTheatre |date= |accessdate=2 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313225454/http://www.aussietheatre.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1226:sydney-theatre-award-nominees&amp;catid=44:general&amp;Itemid=67 |archivedate=13 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Extreme Cagefighting''' ('''WEC''') was an American [[mixed martial arts|mixed martial arts (MMA)]] promotion founded in 2001. It was purchased by [[Zuffa, LLC]], the parent company of the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)]], in 2006.  In its final incarnation, it was made up of 3 weight classes: {{convert|135|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, {{convert|145|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and {{convert|155|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. To accommodate the smaller fighters, WEC's cage was {{convert|25|feet|m}} in diameter—{{convert|5|feet|m}} smaller than the standard UFC cage.

==History==
Scott Adams and Reed Harris started the organization in 2001. Between 2001 and 2006, most of their events were held at [[Tachi Palace Hotel &amp; Casino]] in [[Lemoore, California]], and aired on [[HDNet]].

In December 2006, Zuffa purchased WEC. With the purchase, WEC continued as a separate promotion with its own roster of fighters. Adams was retained after the purchase as the organization's matchmaker. Harris and Adams were named co-General Managers and were both active in the new WEC.&lt;ref name="mmaw"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Sean Shelby was named the new match-maker for the promotion by Zuffa.

Zuffa made several changes to the promotion after the purchase. It discontinued its pentagonal cage for a modified version of the UFC's octagonal cage. The championships of fighters who were contracted UFC fighters were vacated. The promotion moved to focus on lighter weight classes, abandoning their [[Heavyweight (MMA)|heavyweight]] and [[Super Heavyweight (MMA)|super heavyweight]] divisions and championships, and retaining their [[Bantamweight (MMA)|bantamweight]] and [[Featherweight (MMA)|featherweight]] divisions—two divisions not then present in the UFC.&lt;ref name="sher"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; After the purchase, several WEC events were held in Zuffa's hometown of [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], much like the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]].

WEC aired their events live on Versus (formerly known as the Outdoor Life Network and now as the [[NBC Sports Network]]) in the United States and on [[The Sports Network|TSN]] (and later [[The Score Television Network|The Score]]) in Canada.&lt;ref name="mma"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; WEC's first live event was broadcast on June 3, 2007 on Versus from [[The Joint (music venue)|The Joint]] at the [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Las Vegas)|Hard Rock Hotel and Casino]] in Las Vegas.

[[Todd Harris]] was the play by play announcer on every televised WEC event on Versus, and was joined by former UFC Heavyweight Champion [[Frank Mir]] on color commentary until the spring of 2010, when Mir was replaced by UFC light heavyweight [[Stephan Bonnar]]. Fellow Zuffa fighters [[Kenny Florian]] and [[Jens Pulver]] have also filled in on color commentary due to Mir or Bonnar's absences. UFC announcers [[Mike Goldberg]] and [[Joe Rogan]] called WEC's only pay-per-view event, [[WEC 48]] in April 2010. Postfight interviews on the Versus-televised cards were typically done by either Harris or Versus sportscaster [[Craig Hummer]].

[[Joe A. Martinez|Joe Martinez]] served as the announcer for Zuffa-promoted WEC events until April 2010, when he left the organization and was replaced by UFC announcer [[Bruce Buffer]]. However, Martinez made a one-off return at [[WEC 52]] that November when Buffer was overseas for [[UFC 122|a UFC event]].

WEC announced that it would dissolve their light heavyweight and middleweight divisions after their December 3, 2008 event to further their concentration on lighter classes. Fighters from the light heavyweight and middleweight divisions started fighting in the UFC after the dissolution of their divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/templates/dailynews.asp?articleid=7206&amp;zoneid=2|title=WEC shuts down 205 &amp; 185-pound weight classes |first=Damon |last=Martin |work=MMAWeekly.com |date=August 26, 2008 |accessdate=August 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, on February 3, 2009, WEC officially announced the creation of a {{convert|125|lb|kg|abbr=on}} [[Flyweight (MMA)|flyweight]] division and the dissolution of its welterweight division (flyweight would have been the last division under the "[[Mixed martial arts rules#Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts|Unified Rules of MMA]]" to be activated under Zuffa, excluding [[Super heavyweight (MMA)|Super Heavyweight]]).  Fighters from the welterweight division started fighting in the UFC after the dissolution of their division. The only weight class that still crossed over between WEC and the UFC prior to the merger was the {{convert|155|lb|kg|abbr=on}} lightweight division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=February 3, 2009 |accessdate=May 1, 2009 |url=http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/templates/dailynews.asp?articleid=8115&amp;zoneid=13 |title=WEC axes welterweights; announces flyweights |publisher=MMAWeekly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 8, 2010, World Extreme Cagefighting announced that AMP Energy would be the official energy drink of WEC.  Amp Energy also sponsored three of WEC's top stars - [[Featherweight (MMA)|featherweight]] [[Urijah Faber]], featherweight [[Chad Mendes]], and [[Bantamweight (MMA)|bantamweight]] [[Joseph Benavidez]].

On April 24, 2010, WEC held its only [[pay-per-view]] event, [[WEC 48]], which featured two championship fights. The main event featured WEC Featherweight Champion [[José Aldo]] defending his title against former champion [[Urijah Faber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wec.tv/index.cfm?fa=eventdetail.fightCard&amp;eid=2922|title=WEC|author=|date=|website=www.wec.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2010, UFC President [[Dana White]] announced that WEC would merge with the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]].&lt;ref&gt;http://mmajunkie.com/news/21189/ufc-and-wec-set-to-merge-in-2011-events-to-air-on-versus-and-spike-tv.mma&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with UFC==
Due to its shared ownership under Zuffa, fans and commentators had continually speculated about a unification between WEC and the UFC, particularly the lower weight classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/mma/2008-07-30-wec_N.htm|title=UFC has weight-and-see attitude for WEC - USATODAY.com|author=|date=|website=www.usatoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/mma/08/25/ufc.wec.merger/index.html|title=A UFC-WEC merger?

On October 28, 2010, Dana White announced the merger with the UFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCIWWLnJSN4&amp;feature=sub|title=Exclusive: Dana White Announces UFC-WEC Merger|first=|last=Ariel Helwani|date=October 28, 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
On December 11, 2006 UFC parent-company, [[Zuffa]] formalized plans to buy World Extreme Cagefighting, to be run as a separate promotion from the UFC. Following the purchase of WEC, Zuffa made several changes to the promotion. One of the most noteworthy changes included added media exposure when WEC signed a deal to air events on [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]] beginning with [[WEC 28]]. Prior to this WEC had broadcast most of their events on [[HDNet]].

While on [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]], WEC drew good ratings that averaged around 575,000 average viewers per event. However ratings ranged from 245,000 to 1,500,000.

The biggest ratings draw for WEC was [[Urijah Faber]]. When Faber was featured in a main event he drew an average of 840,000 viewers. Faber was also featured in both main events ([[WEC 34|34]] and [[WEC 41|41]]) that drew over a million viewers for WEC.
