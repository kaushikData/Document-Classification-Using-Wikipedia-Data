'''Muhammad 'Abd al-Karim Sabun''' (died 1815) was (Sultan) of [[Ouaddai Empire|Wadai]], a Muslim state in what is now eastern [[Chad]], from 1804 to 1815.  He pursued an expansionist policy, and was the greatest of the rulers of Wadai.

==Accession==

Abd al-Karim Sabun ascended the throne of Wadai on [[Rajab]] 1219 (May–June 1804).{{sfn|O'Fahey|2008|p=74}}
Sabun was the eldest son of the ineffective ''Kolak'' [[Salih Derret]]. As the result of a conspiracy, his father was killed and Sabun assumed the throne.
His father's other children were not yet grown, but his brother Asad posed a threat.{{sfn|Nachtigal|1971|p=213}} 
Asad fled to Darfur, but was lured back on the pretense that he had support for his claim to the throne.
He was then seized, taken to the capital, [[Wara, Chad|Wara]], and blinded.{{sfn|Nachtigal|1971|p=213-214}} 
Sabun became ruler of a state that under Salih Derret controlled the area of the east-central [[Chad Basin]] south of the [[Sahara]] and north of the [[Salamat Region|Bahr es Salamat]], between [[Kanem Region|Kanem]] in the west and the [[Sultanate of Darfur]] in the east.{{sfn|Azevedo|1998|p=27}}

==Military conflict==
[[File:CentralEastAfrica1750.png|thumb|240px|States in the central Sudan]]

Sabun supplied his army with chain mail and firearms, dispatching them on looting expeditions against [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] and [[Kingdom of Baguirmi|Baguirmi]].{{sfn|Shillington|2005|p=204}}
Around 1805 or 1806,{{efn|The exact dates and sequence of events at this time in the central Sudan differ depending on the source.{{sfn|Azevedo|1998|p=27}}}} Sabun used the excuse that Abder Rahman Gaurang I of Baguirmi had sinfully married his own sister as a reason to attack.{{sfn|Azevedo|1998|p=27}}
He captured the capital, [[Massenya]], and killed the ''mbang'' and his family.{{sfn|Shillington|2005|p=202}}
He took a huge booty including 20,000 slaves, and appointed a puppet ruler in Bagirmi.{{sfn|Azevedo|1998|p=27}}
For many years after this, the Wadai armies freely plundered their southern neighbor.{{sfn|Shillington|2005|p=202}}

Wadai suffered raids from Dar Tama, a vassal kingdom of Darfur.
Sabun complained about the raids to [[Muhammad al-Fadl]] of Darfur and received a conciliatory reply, but the raids continued. 
Sabun eventually invaded Dar Tama, supported by twenty-two musketeers from the [[Fezzan]], [[Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]]. 
The Tama ''malik'', Ahmad, had to take refuge in Darfur.{{sfn|O'Fahey|2008|p=74}}
After further fighting, Ahmad was forced to submit to Sabun and to agree to pay annual tribute of a thousand slaves and a hundred horses.
The number of slaves was later reduced to one hundred.{{sfn|O'Fahey|2008|p=75}} 
Sabun also made tributary states of Dar Sila and Dar Runga.{{sfn|Azevedo|1998|p=27}}

==Trade==

Sabun promoted trade and promoted Islam.{{sfn|Shillington|2005|p=204}}   
During his reign, Sabun gained control of a large part of the trade from the central [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] to Tripoli via the [[Fezzan]].{{sfn|O'Fahey|2008|p=50}}
Around 1810 a Majabra trader from [[Jalu]] in Cyrenaica named Schehaymah became lost while travelling to [[Ouaddai Empire|Wadai]] via [[Murzuk]] in the Fezzan.  
He was found by some [[Bidayat]], who took him via [[Ounianga Kébir (town)|Ounianga]] to Wara, the old capital of Wadai.{{sfn|Cordell|1977|p=22}}
Sabun agreed with Schehaymah's proposal to open a caravan route to Benghazi along a direct route through [[Kufra]], and [[Awjila]] / Jalu. 
This new route would bypass both Fezzan and Darfur, states that until then had controlled the eastern Saharan trade. 
The first caravans traveled the route between 1809 and 1820.{{sfn|Cordell|1977|p=22}}

==Legacy==

Sabun died in 1230 (1815/6).{{sfn|O'Fahey|2008|p=75}}
He was preparing to invade Bornu at the time of his death.{{sfn|Azevedo|1998|p=27}} 
His death was followed by a prolonged succession struggle. 
Sabun's younger brother, [[Muhammad al-Sharif]], finally gained power in 1838 as a client of the Sultan of Darfur.{{sfn|Shillington|2005|p=204}}

'''''Abu Jaʿfar An-Nahhas''''' ({{lang|ar|أبو جعفر النحاس}}; died 949 / AH 338) was an Egyptian scholar of [[Arabic grammarians|grammar]] and [[tafsir|Qur'anic exegete]] during the
[[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid period]]. His full name was ''Abū Jaʿfar Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Ibn Ismail Ibn Yūnus al-Murādi'', surnamed ''an-Nahhās'' "copper-worker" (a term for artisans who make brass vessels).

== Life ==
Abu Jaʿfar An-Nahhas—whose full name was ''Abū Jaʿfar Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Ibn Ismail Ibn Yūnus al-Murādi'', surnamed ''an-Nahhās'' "copper-worker" (a term for artisans who make brass vessels)—was born in [[Fustat]], he studied in [[Baghdad]] under the foremost grammarians of the period. He is the author of an influential work on [[Naskh (tafsir)|abrogation]], ''Al-Nasikh wa l-Mansukh''.  He wrote a treatise on the grammatical analysis of the [[Qur'an]] and a grammatical primer known as "The Apple" (التفاحة ''at-Tufaha''), besides works on poetry, including  a commentary on the [[Mu'allaqat]].

== Death ==
According to [[Ibn Khallikan]], An-Nahhas was of extremely niggardly and avaricious character. He was killed as he was reciting poetry sitting on the banks of the Nile in Cairo, as a passing peasant thought he was uttering a charm to prevent the rise of the Nile, "so as to raise the price of provisions" and threw him into the river.

An '''Acheri''' is the [[ghost]] or [[spirit]] of a little girl who was either murdered or abused and left to die. She comes down from mountains and hilltops at night to bring sickness to humans, particularly children. They are often depicted with dark or unnatural eyes and can also be referred to as "hill fairies". The only defense against an Acheri was thought to be a red ribbon tied around one's neck. The Acheri is said to bring death to the elderly or other people with low immune system defenses.&lt;ref name="McGowen"&gt;{{cite book| title=Encyclopedia of Legendary Creatures |author=Tom McGowen | publisher=Rand McNally| year=1981| pages=8| isbn=0528824023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Acheri is from the mythology of India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RFJgAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA400&amp;lpg=PA400&amp;dq=Acheri+indian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qph8j8eI_a&amp;sig=-LTgUkeDhV5rzi7HDo750FtiOMA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim1d3w54TXAhUF32MKHTMcBFIQ6AEIhAEwFg#v=onepage&amp;q=Acheri%20indian&amp;f=false| title=Descriptive Ethnology, Vol. II: Europe, Africa, India|author=Robert Gordon Latham}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some sources mistakenly attribute them to [[Folklore of the United States#Native American folklore|Native American folklore]].

'''Adam C. Emery''' (born November 10, 1962) is an American [[fugitive]]. On November 10, 1993, he was convicted of [[second-degree murder]] in the death of a twenty-year-old man in a [[road rage]] incident in [[Rhode Island]]. Before formal sentencing, Emery disappeared from the [[Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge]] just hours after being released on [[bail]]. Although he was declared legally dead in 2004, Emery remains on the FBI's most wanted list.

==Murder of Jason Bass and disappearance==
On the evening of August 31, 1990, Adam Emery's 1985 [[Ford Thunderbird]] was sideswiped by a passing vehicle while he and his wife, Elena, were at a [[Rocky Point Amusement Park|Rocky Point]] restaurant with another couple.&lt;ref name="emery"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/when-adam-lost-the-tail-light-of-his-t-bird-things-got-bad-then-they-got-worse-a-truth-is-stranger-1396426.html|title=When Adam lost the tail-light of his T-Bird, things got bad. Then they Got Worse a Truth is Stranger|publisher=independent.co.uk|author=Keith Botsford|date=February 26, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enraged, Emery mistakenly chased down the wrong car, and stabbed the driver to death with a military knife. The murdered driver was twenty-year-old Jason Bass.

'''Albert IV''' (or ''Albert III'', depending on the counting scheme; {{circa|1180}} &amp;ndash; 22 July 1253) was [[County of Tyrol|Count of Tyrol]] from 1202 until his death, the last from the original House of [[Tirol Castle|Tirol]]. He also served as ''[[Vogt]]'' of the bishoprics of [[Bishopric of Trent|Trent]] and [[Bishopric of Brixen|Brixen]].

== Life  ==
He was the son of Count [[Henry I, Count of Tyrol|Henry I]] (d. 14 June 1190) and Agnes of Wangen, daughter of Count  Adalbero I.  He was still a minor when his father died in 1190, and only began to rule independently in 1202. He inherited the office of a Vogt of Trent from his father; in 1210, Bishop Conrad also appointed him Vogt of Brixen.

When in 1209 the [[Counts of Andechs|Counts of Andechs-Merania]] were [[Imperial ban|banned]] for their alleged role in the murder of the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] king [[Philip of Swabia]] at the wedding of Duke [[Otto I, Duke of Merania|Otto I of Merania]] in [[Bamberg]], Albert took over their sovereign rights in the [[Inn (river)|Inn]], [[Wipptal|Wipp]], [[Eisacktal|Eisack]], and [[Val Badia|Gader]] valleys. Shaping the independent County of Tyrol, he consolidated his position by quickly recognizing the now undisputed supremacy of Philip's rival, the [[House of Welf|Welf]] emperor [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]]. After Emperor Otto's death in 1218, he again switched sides and became a loyal supporter of the Hohenstaufen ruler [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. In 1217 he and Bishop Bertold of Brixen joined the [[Fifth Crusade]].

Albert had no sons, so he made sure his daughters would be allowed to inherit. In 1234 he married his daughter Elisabeth (d. 1256) off to the Andechs duke [[Otto II, Duke of Merania|Otto II of Merania]] and his other daughter, Adelaide (d. 1279), to Count [[Meinhard I, Count of Gorizia-Tyrol|Meinhard of Gorizia]], concluding mutual contracts of inheritance with both his sons-in-law. As a result, Albert acquired the Tyrolean possessions held by Otto II of Merania upon his death in 1248 and could also seize the lands of the extinct counts of [[Eppan an der Weinstraße|Eppan]] in the same year.

In the fierce controversy after the deposition of Emperor Frederick II by [[Pope Innocent IV]] in 1245, Albert remained a protagonist of the imperial party and took the occasion to invade the ecclesiastical territories of Bishop-elect [[Philip of Spanheim|Philip of Salzburg]]. In 1252, however, Albert and his son-in-law Meinhard were taken prisoner at [[Greifenburg]] by the united forces of Philip and his father Duke [[Bernhard von Spanheim|Bernard of Carinthia]]. Held in custody in [[Friesach]], they were not released until December, after they ceded important possessions in Upper Carinthia, paid a large ransom and put up Meinhard's two sons as hostages.

Albert IV died the next year and was buried in [[Stams]]. His inheritance was at first divided between his sons-in-law Meinhard and Count Gebhard IV of Hischberg, the second husband of his daughter Elisabeth. Gebhard had no children, so after his death, Meinhard's son [[Meinhard, Duke of Carinthia|Meinhard II]] re-united Albert's possessions.

During his lifetime, Albert had tried to unite his possessions in the Tyrol area into a single county. In 1254, this entity was called the {{lang|la|dominium Tyrolis}} or {{lang|la|comecia Tyrolis}}.

== Marriage and issue ==
Around 1211 Albert married Uta (d. 1254),daughter of the [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavarian]] count Henry II of Frontenhausen-Lechsgemünd (d. 1208). Albert and Uta had two daughters:
* Adelaide ({{circa|1218/1220}} &amp;ndash; 26 May 1279), married to Count [[Meinhard I, Count of Gorizia-Tyrol|Meinhard I]] of Gorizia (d. 1258)
* Elisabeth ({{circa|1220/1225}} &amp;ndash; 10 October 1256), married:
*# in 1239 to Duke [[Otto II, Duke of Merania|Otto II]] of Andechs-Merania (d. 19 June 1248)
*# in 1249, to Count Gebhard IV of Hirschberg (d. 1275)

'''Algorithmic entities''' are [[autonomous]] [[algorithms]] that operate without human control. Recently, attention is being given to ''legal algorithmic entities'' that may obtain [[personhood]] or identity for purposes of conducting legal proceedings. Legal analysis demonstrates that this is possible and likely.&lt;ref&gt; https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_lawreview/vol95/iss4/7 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynn M. LoPucki, ''Algorithmic Entities'', 95 Wash. U. L. Rev. 887 (2018).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] is considering a case to grant a specific legal status for robots.&lt;ref&gt;
https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/the-eu-is-trying-to-decide-whether-to-grant-robots-personhood.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretical work is equating [[intelligent agents]] and robots with algorithmic entities,&lt;ref&gt;Svozil, K. (2000). Quantum interfaces. arXiv preprint quant-ph/0001064&lt;/ref&gt; and connecting them with global catastrophic risks associated with [[Artificial Intelligence]]&lt;ref&gt;Turchin, A., &amp; Denkenberger, D. (2018). ''Classification of global catastrophic risks connected with artificial intelligence''. AI &amp; SOCIETY, 1-17&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/perspectives/PE200/PE237/RAND_PE237.pdf &lt;ref&gt;Osoba, O. A., &amp; Welser IV, W. (2017). ''The Risks of Artificial Intelligence to Security and the Future of Work''&lt;/ref&gt;][[Algorithmic entities#cite note-4|&lt;span class="mw-reflink-text"&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt;]]

Algorithmic entities can satisfy the requirements of [[Juridical person]]hood. [[Shawn Bayern]] demonstrated several ways of how algorithmic/autonomous systems could possess private-law rights of legal persons by means of limited liability companies (LLCs),.&lt;ref&gt;Bayern, Shawn, ''The Implications of Modern Business-Entity Law for the Regulation of Autonomous Systems''. 19 Stanford Technology Law Review 93 (2015); FSU College of Law, Public Law Research Paper No. 797; FSU College of Law, Law, Business &amp; Economics Paper No. 797.

{{History of the Philippines}}

The '''Balangiga bells''' are three [[church bells]] taken by the [[United States Army]] from the town church of [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar]] in the [[Philippines]] as [[war trophies]] after reprisals following the [[Balangiga massacre]] in 1901 during the [[Philippine-American War]]. One church bell is in the possession of the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th Infantry Regiment]] at [[Camp Red Cloud]], their base in [[South Korea]],&lt;ref name="nene"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=Voluntary Return of One Balangiga Bell by US Seen |url=http://www.nenepimentel.org/news/20031002_Balangiga.asp |accessdate=2008-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517125827/http://www.nenepimentel.org/news/20031002_Balangiga.asp |archivedate=2011-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="solving"&gt;{{cite web | last =Borrinaga | first =Rolando | title =Solving the Balangiga bell puzzle | url=http://www.geocities.com/rolborr/balbellspuzzle.html | accessdate = 2008-03-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022080959/http://geocities.com/rolborr/balbellspuzzle.html|archivedate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; while two others are on a former base of the [[11th Infantry Regiment (United States)|11th Infantry Regiment]] at [[F.

The recovery of the bells had been sought by various individuals representing the [[Catholic Church in the Philippines]], the [[Government of the Philippines|Philippine government]] and the residents of Balangiga since the late 1950s. These efforts however, have been met with frustration until recently. As of November 2018, all three church bells are in the process of being repatriated back to the Philippines from the United States and South Korea.&lt;ref name=chua/&gt;

==Balangiga massacre==
{{Main|Balangiga massacre}}
On September 28, 1901, Filipino militants from the village of Balangiga ambushed Company C of the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th U.S. Infantry Regiment]], while they were at breakfast, killing an estimated 48 and wounding 22 of the 78 men of the unit, with only four escaping unhurt. The villagers captured about 100 rifles and 25,000 rounds of ammunition. An estimated 20 to 25 of the villagers had died in the fighting, with a similar number of wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bautista |first=Veltisezar |title=The Balangiga, Samar, Massacre |url=http://www.filipinoamericans.net/balangiga_massacre.shtml |accessdate=2008-03-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226150445/http://www.filipinoamericans.net/balangiga_massacre.shtml |archivedate=2008-02-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reprisal, General [[Jacob H. Smith]] ordered that Samar be turned into a "howling wilderness" and that any Filipino male above ten years of age capable of bearing arms be shot. From the burned-out Catholic town church, the Americans looted three bells which they took back to the United States as [[war booty]]. The [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th U.S. Infantry Regiment]], however, maintains that the single bell in their possession was presented to the regiment by villagers when the unit left Balangiga on April 9, 1902.&lt;ref name="robson"&gt;{{cite news | last =Robson | first =Seth | title =Book casts doubt on bell's history | pages = | publisher =[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]] | date = 2004-07-07 |

Waller was acquitted of the charges. Smith was found guilty, admonished and retired from service, but charges were dropped shortly after. He was later hailed as a war hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Philippine Insurrection, 1899-1902: A Working Bibliography | url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/history/marshall/military/mil_hist_inst/p/pi2.asc|website=Ibiblio.org | accessdate = 2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bells==
After Balangiga became a separate parish on September 27, 1859, the town probably took four years to raise funds to acquire its first church bell.

The town may have acquired its second bell, cast circa-1889 and having a mouth diameter of {{fraction|27|3|4}} inches and height of {{fraction|27|1|2}} inches, in 1889 through the initiative of Fr. Agustin Delgado, whose name is inscribed on the bell.&lt;ref name=solving1 /&gt;

The third and smallest bell may have been acquired in 1895, through the initiative of Fr. Bernardo Aparecio. This is the bell now kept by the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th U.S. Infantry Regiment]] in [[Camp Red Cloud]], [[South Korea]]. Estimates of its size deduce a 23–24 inch height and a mouth diameter of about 20 inches. It bears the [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] emblem.&lt;ref name="solving"/&gt;

===Removal to the United States===
After the Balangiga incident, the town was recaptured on September 29, 1901 by 55 men of Company G, 9th Infantry. That unit departed the town the same day, and was replaced by 132 men from Companies K and L of the 11th Infantry Regiment which garrisoned the town until relieved on October 18, 1901. When the 11th Infantry departed, they brought home the [[war trophies]]. These
included two of the bells removed from the burnt-down Balangiga Church, and a [[cannon]] from the plaza in front of the church. The bells were taken because one had been used by the insurgents to signal the attack on Company C, 9th Infantry.&lt;ref name=annals /&gt;

The 11th Infantry redeployed to [[Fort D.A. Russell (Wyoming)|Fort D.A. Russell]] in [[Wyoming]], arriving on March 23, 1904. On May 16, 1905, the Cheyenne Daily Leader newspaper reported that the cannon had been mounted on the parade ground near the flagpole along with other relics from the Philippines "...to include the famous bell which gave the signal for the massacre of a whole company. Two large bells three feet tall and a seven-foot cannon were proudly displayed in front of the flagpole on the parade ground of the fort".&lt;ref name=annals /&gt;

A sign was installed over one of the bells that said;
{{quote|This bell hung in the church at Balangiga, Samar, PI, and rung the signal for the attack on Company C, 9th U.S. Infantry, Sept 29 [28], 1901. Taken by Company L, 11th Infantry and detachment of Company K, 11th Infantry, the first units to reach the scene after the massacre.&lt;ref name=annals&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/annalsofwyom59121987wyom|title=The F.E.

The sign above the bell erroneously credited units of the 11th Infantry with being the first to reach Balangiga after the battle. After further research, the sign was changed in 1911 giving proper credit to Company G, 9th Infantry, for recapturing Balangiga.&lt;ref name=annals /&gt;

In 1927, Fort Russell was renamed Fort Francis E. Warren. On 7 October 1949, it became [[Francis E. Warren Air Force Base]]. 

In 1967, a curved red brick wall was constructed in the Warren AFB trophy park for the bells, with a bronze plaque on the wall between the bells telling the story of the massacre at Balangiga. {{as of|1987}}, a faint inscription was visible on the back of both bells, reading:
{{center|&lt;poem&gt;USED BY {{sic|PHILIP|PINOS}}

OF COMPANY "C" NINTH INFANTRY

28TH SEPTEMBER 1901&lt;ref name=annals /&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

{{as of|2001}}, a glass case housed the bells along with the 400-year-old British [[Falconet (cannon)|Falcon cannon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mead |first=Griver |title=For Whom the Bells Toll |pages= |publisher=AsianWeek.com |date=2001-10-11 |url=http://asianweek.com/2001_10_05/news_bells.html |accessdate=2008-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827192806/http://www.asianweek.com/2001_10_05/news_bells.html |archivedate=2008-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Fact Sheets:F.E.

The third church bell which was in the possession of the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th U.S. Infantry Regiment]] is kept at the 2nd Infantry Division Museum in [[Camp Red Cloud]], [[Uijeongbu]]. It had previously been displayed at the unit's [[Camp Hovey]] headquarters.&lt;ref name="robson"/&gt;

==Recovery attempts==
In the mid-1990s, during the term of [[Fidel Ramos]] as Philippine President, attempts were initiated by his government to recover one or more of the bells from [[Bill Clinton]]'s administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=The Saga of the Balangiga Bells |url=http://davinci.rodal-intl.org:8020/rudy/filipinas/balangiga.html |accessdate=2008-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121143002/http://davinci.rodal-intl.org:8020/rudy/filipinas/balangiga.html |archivedate=2010-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =The Bells of Balangiga Revisited | url=http://www.philnews.com/2005/da.html |website=Philnews.com| accessdate = 2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States government has been adamant that the bells are US government property, that it would take an [[Act of Congress]] to return them and that the Catholic Church has no say in the matter. For their part the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] hold the position that the bells are inappropriate as trophies of war.&lt;ref name="cbcp"/&gt;

In 2002, the [[Senate of the Philippines|Philippine Senate]] approved Senate Resolution No. 393, authored by [[Aquilino Pimentel Jr.]], urging the [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo|Arroyo]] administration to undertake formal negotiations with the United States for the return of the bells.&lt;ref name="nene"/&gt;

In 2005, the bishop of [[Borongan]], [[Samar]], Bishop Leonardo Medroso and Balangiga parish priest Saturnino Obzunar wrote an open letter addressed to President [[George W. Bush]], the [[United States Congress]] and the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|Helsinki Commission]], requesting them to facilitate the return of the bells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Pilapil | first =Jaime | title =Balangiga bells to be returned to RP soon | pages = | publisher =Manila Standard Today | date = 2005-11-14 | url =http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=news03_nov14_2005 | accessdate = 2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the Wyoming Veterans’ Commission favored the return of the Filipino-American War relics, however, [[Wyoming]] Governor [[Dave Freudenthal]] stated that he disagreed with the Commission and opposed returning the bells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lariosa |first=Joseph |title=US vets group wants to return Balangiga Bells to RP |pages= |publisher=The Filipino Express |date=2005-04-14 |url=http://www.filipinoexpress.com/19/16_news.html |accessdate=2008-03-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316202735/http://www.filipinoexpress.com/19/16_news.html |archivedate=2008-03-16 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 13, 2005, United States Congressman [[Bob Filner]] had introduced H.Res.313, urging the President to authorize the transfer of ownership of one of the bells to the people of the Philippines. The resolution died on January 3, 2007, with the ''sine die'' adjournment of the [[109th United States Congress]].

On September 26, 2006, United States Congressman Bob Filner, Congressman [[Dana Rohrabacher]] and Congressman [[Ed Case]] co-sponsored House Concurrent Resolution No. 481 urging the president of the United States to authorize the return of the church bells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Sampayan | first =Sonny | title =Bells of Balangiga Resolution filed in U.S. Congress | pages = | publisher =Samar News.com | date = 2006-09-29 | url =http://www.samarnews.com/news_clips5/news85.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080313233923/http://www.samarnews.com/news_clips5/news85.htm| archivedate= 13 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution died on January 3, 2009, with the ''sine die'' adjournment of the [[110th United States Congress]].

The townspeople of Balangiga asked the United States to return their church bells after receiving relief from the U.S. military subsequent to [[Typhoon Haiyan]] hitting the town in 2013.&lt;ref name="reuters please bells"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/21/us-philippines-typhoon-usa-idUSBRE9AK1CO20131121 | title=Please can we have our bells back?

In his second [[State of the Nation Address (Philippines)|State of the Nation Address]] on July 24, 2017, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] demanded the bells' return, citing ownership of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2017/07/24/duterte-us-return-balangiga-bells-554668 |title=Duterte to US: Return Balangiga bells |work=Sunstar Philippines |location=Manila |publisher=Sunstar Philippines |date=2017-07-24 |accessdate=2017-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.philippinerevolution.info/statements/20170801-balangigas-lasting-relevance-of-peoples-uprising-will-haunt-duterte|title= Balangiga’s lasting relevance of people’s uprising will haunt Duterte|publisher=Sunstar Philippines|date=August 1, 2017|accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He however did not raise the issue in a bilateral meeting with US President [[Donald Trump]] held in November 2017 during the [[2017 ASEAN Summits|31st ASEAN Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Ranada | first =Pia | title =Duterte doesn't raise Balangiga bells with Trump | publisher =[[Rappler]] | date = 14 November 2017 | url =https://www.rappler.com/nation/188423-duterte-balangiga-bells-trump-bilateral-meeting-asean-summit-2017 | accessdate = 25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018 two US lawmakers, [[Randy Hultgren]] and [[Jim McGovern (American politician)|Jim McGovern]], objected to the bells being returned to the Philippines due to the current human rights record established by Duterte's [[Philippine Drug War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Cabico | first =Gaea Katreena | title =US solons object return of Balangiga bells to Philippines due to human rights concerns | publisher =[[The Philippine Star]] | date = 7 February 2018 | url =https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/02/07/1785490/us-solons-object-return-balangiga-bells-philippines-due-human-rights-concerns | accessdate = 12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential repatriation ==
In August 2018, the [[Embassy of the United States, Manila| US Embassy in the Philippines]] issued a statement that the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] had notified the [[United States Congress]] that it plans to return the bells to the Philippines at an unspecified date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Morales | first =Neil Jerome | title =U.S. to return colonization era church bells to the Philippines | publisher =[[Reuters]] | date = 12 August 2018 | url =https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-usa-bells/u-s-to-return-colonization-era-church-bells-to-the-philippines-idUSKBN1KW0FT | accessdate = 12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, Dr. Rolando Borrinaga of the Philippines' [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]] stated that the two bells at the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base will be turned over to Philippine representatives on 15 November 2018. The third bell in South Korea is also ready for repatriation.&lt;ref name=abs&gt;{{cite news | last=Tagala | first=Don | title =Balangiga Bells to begin journey home to Philippines | publisher =[[ABS-CBN News]] | date = 12 November 2018 | url =https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/12/18/us-to-return-balangiga-bells-to-philippines | accessdate = 14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two bells in Wyoming will then be shipped to [[Philadelphia]] for restoration work before being sent to South Korea, where they will join the third bell.

The successful campaign to return the bells came about due to the support of veterans organizations, including the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] and the [[American Legion]], according to Dr. Borrinaga. Another source cited Borrinaga, and former [[United States Navy]] officers Dennis Wright and Dan McKinnon as those who "campaigned to have the bells repatriated";&lt;ref name=sem&gt;{{cite news | last =Sembrano | first =Edgar Allan M. | title =Balangiga bells to be returned December | publisher =[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] | date = 29 October 2018 | url =https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/311487/balangiga-bells-to-be-returned-december/ | accessdate = 15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; these same American ex-servicemen had spearheaded the recovery from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] in 2016 of another church bell taken in 1901 from the Saints Peter and Paul Church in [[Bauang, La Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Olson | first =Wyatt | title =West Point returns bell taken from Philippines church 100 years ago | publisher =[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]] | date = 29 April 2016 | url =https://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/west-point-returns-bell-taken-from-philippines-church-100-years-ago-1.407085 | accessdate = 20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippine government however, declined further comment until the bells have been fully repatriated.&lt;ref name=abs/&gt; The bells are expected to arrive in the Philippines in December 2018.&lt;ref name=sem/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Orellana | first =Faye  | title =Balangiga bells to be in PH by late December | publisher =[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] | date = 13 November 2018 | url =https://m.inquirer.net/globalnation/171029 | accessdate = 15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bayonne refinery strikes of 1915–1916''' were labor actions of refinery workers in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], mostly Polish-Americans&lt;ref&gt;Brenner, Aaron; Benjamin Day; Ness, Immanuel. ''The Encyclopedia of Strikes in American History''. page 145&lt;/ref&gt; who struck [[Standard Oil of New Jersey]] and [[Tidewater Petroleum]] plants on [[Constable Hook]] beginning in mid-July 1915.

== The 1915 strike ==
Initially about 1200 workers walked out, including 900 coopers, when their demands for increased pay and tolerable working conditions were ignored. The company retaliated by calling in the Bayonne police force through the [[Mayor of Bayonne, New Jersey]], [[Pierre P. Garven (mayor)|Pierre P. Garven]], who was simultaneously on Standard Oil's payroll as an attorney.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Strikes in American History, by Aaron Brenner, Benjamin Day, Immanuel Ness, page 145&lt;/ref&gt;  A riot on July 20, 1915 involving the strikers, police and "several hundred women" shut down the Standard Oil plant,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]''. July 21, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; and caused the shooting death of 19-year-old striker John Sterancsak.&lt;ref name=NJ38-213&gt;{{cite book|title=Thirty-Eighth Annual Report of the Bureau of Industrial Statistics of New Jersey for the year ending October 31st, 1915|year=1916|volume=38|publisher=S. Chew &amp;amp; Sons, Co., Printers | location=Camden, N.J. |page=213|url=https://archive.org/stream/annualreportofbu38newj#page/212/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plant general manager George B. Gifford ordered 250 men from the professional strikebreaker [[Pearl Bergoff]].

The following day a mob attacked the Tidewater refinery in an attempt to set it on fire.  After several days of lawlessness, significant arson damage, at least five strikers killed altogether, and at least five more seriously wounded, Sheriff [[Eugene Francis Kinkead]] and federal labor mediators restored order after  [[James Fairman Fielder]], the [[Governor of New Jersey]] refused to call out the [[New Jersey National Guard]].  The General Superintendent of the Tidewater facility and 32 guards were arrested on a charge of inciting to riot.  A total of 130 plant guards would be arrested.  Saloons were closed.  Local officials also arrested the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] agitator [[Frank Tannenbaum]], who had tried to insert himself as a spokesperson for the strikers, and banned the sale of the socialist newspaper, the ''[[New York Call]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brenner, et al. page 145&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 28th, the workers warily returned on promises of increased pay and the institution of an [[eight-hour day]], promises which appear to have been kept by September.&lt;ref name=NJ38-225&gt;{{cite book|title=Thirty-Eighth Annual Report of the Bureau of Industrial Statistics of New Jersey for the year ending October 31st, 1915|year=1916|volume=38|publisher=S.

== The 1916 strike ==
Refinery workers struck Standard Oil again on October 3 through 20, 1916 for increased wages.  Only thirty-six workers in the paraffin department caused thousands of other workers to join the action. Additional workers may have joined the original group of pressmen because the Standard Oil works closed down on the 10th, or when trolley lines to the adjoining Tidewater and Eagle Oil plants were blocked.&lt;ref name=NJ40-227&gt;{{cite book|title=Fortieth Annual Report of the Bureau of Industrial Statistics of New Jersey for the year ending October 31st, 1917|year=1918|volume=40|publisher=Hudson Printing Company, Printers | location=Union Hill, N.J. |pages=227–231|url=https://archive.org/stream/annualreport28unkngoog#page/n233/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dangerous riot conditions again took hold of the area around the plants.  In a charge against police lines on the 10th, three policemen and eight workmen were shot and wounded.  On the 11th, a mob of five hundred besieged police headquarters and looted saloons for liquor.  Seven were shot the next day, including a woman fatally wounded as she looked out of her second-story window.  Organized police action on the 13th, the tenth straight day of rioting, quelled the mob.&lt;ref name=NJ40-227/&gt;

The strike ended on October 19 as the strikers returned to work with no concessions given.  The estimated total casualties were four dead and 34 wounded, 11 of those seriously wounded.&lt;ref name=NJ40-232&gt;{{cite book|title=Fortieth Annual Report of the Bureau of Industrial Statistics of New Jersey for the year ending October 31st, 1917|year=1918|volume=40|publisher=Hudson Printing Company, Printers | location=Union Hill, N.J. |pages=232|url=https://archive.org/stream/annualreport28unkngoog#page/n239/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The Standard Oil company had long been a target of public criticism, and its conduct during the strike only intensified it.  Following the strike John D. Rockefeller Jr. decided to no longer rely on an exclusively repressive stance towards labor -- "Whenever it shows its head, hit it"—and overhaul its policy.  To this end he hired Clarence Hicks, who recommended a sweeping plan of employee benefits, including a pension plan.  This approach was only partially successful, however, since labor recognized the intent of tying workers to the company and preventing strike action by including pension provisions that would penalize strike activity.&lt;ref&gt;Quadagno, Jill.

'''Carnosine''' (''beta''-alanyl-&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-histidine), featuring the characteristic [[imidazole]]-ring, is a [[dipeptide]] molecule, made up of the [[amino acid]]s [[beta-Alanine|beta-alanine]] and [[histidine]]. It is highly concentrated in [[muscle]] and [[brain]] [[biological tissue|tissue]]s.

Carnosine and [[carnitine]] were discovered by Russian chemist [[Vladimir Gulevich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/cber.19000330275 |title=Ueber das Carnosin, eine neue organische Base des Fleischextractes |year=1900 |last1=Gulewitsch |first1=Wl. |last2=Amiradžibi |first2=S. |journal=Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=1902–1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proven to scavenge [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) as well as alpha-beta unsaturated [[aldehydes]] formed from peroxidation of cell membrane [[fatty acids]] during [[oxidative stress]]. It also buffers pH in muscle cells, and acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain. It is also a [[zwitterion]], a neutral molecule with a positive and negative end.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Like carnitine, carnosine is composed of the root word ''carn'', meaning "flesh", alluding to its prevalence in animal protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Physiological effects==

===Atherosclerosis and aging===
Carnosine acts as an antiglycating agent, reducing the rate of formation of [[advanced glycation end-products]]  (substances that can be a factor in the development or worsening of many [[degenerative diseases]], such as [[diabetes]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[chronic renal failure]], and [[Alzheimer's disease]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vistoli|first=G|author2=De Maddis, D|author3= Cipak, A|author4= Zarkovic, N|author5= Carini, M|author6= Aldini, G|title=Advanced glycoxidation and lipoxidation end products (AGEs and ALEs): an overview of their mechanisms of formation.|journal=Free Radic Res.|date=Aug 2013|volume=47|pages=Suppl 1:3–27.|pmid=23767955|doi=10.3109/10715762.2013.815348}}

'''Clark Daniel Stearns''' (1870 &amp;ndash; May 25, 1944) was the ninth [[List of governors of American Samoa|Naval Governor of American Samoa]]. Stearns commanded various vessels, on which he set up organized committees for the crew to give suggestions to the officers. He hoped to alleviate tensions between the enlisted men and officers. However, upon his appointment to the [[battleship]] {{USS|Michigan|BB-27}}, he was removed from command of these activities.

Stearns relieved Nathan Woodworth Post as Governor of [[American Samoa]] on July 14, 1913, and helped the Samoans achieve more involvement in government. He received a medal from the [[Japanese Red Cross]], as well as the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]] during his career. He retired at the rank of [[Captain (United States)#US Navy, US Coast Guard, US Public Health Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|Captain]].&lt;ref&gt;Military Times (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Stearns was born in Big Rapids, MeCosta County, Michigan.&lt;ref name=UM&gt;Genealogy and Memoirs of Isaac Stearns and His Descendants, Avis Stearns van Wagenen, Courier Printing Co., Syracuse, 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in June 1893.&lt;ref name=rename3&gt;New York Times, June 2, 1893.&lt;/ref&gt; He died on May 25, 1944 aboard a submarine chaser off [[Miami, Florida]] of a [[coronary thrombosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen and Theroux (2007), 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naval career===
In 1918, Stearns was posted to {{USS|Roanoke|ID-1695|6}}, a civilian ship converted into a [[minelayer]], where he eventually took command. While in command, Stearns allowed the crew to form two organized committees, one for the [[petty officer]]s, and another composed of one man from each [[Enlisted rank|enlisted]] division.&lt;ref name=Guttridge&gt;Guttridge (2006), 178.&lt;/ref&gt; These committees investigated questionable rulings regarding minor disciplinary actions, and to make complaints and suggestions about the "health, happiness and comfort of the ship's company."&lt;ref name=Guttridge/&gt; He believed that these committees would lead to less unrest on the ship, as there would be less tension between officers and enlisted sailors, and [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Josephus Daniels]] supported the effort.&lt;ref name=Guttridge/&gt; 
During his command of ''Roanoke'', Stearns received the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]].&lt;ref name=Guttridge/&gt; After leaving command of ''Roanoke'', Stearns examined the Naval Penal System, ruled it "archaic", and recommended the creation of an Office of Discipline.&lt;ref name=Guttridge/&gt;

Stearns commanded the battleship USS ''Michigan'' next, but was relieved of his command in 1921 after only 107 days, after allowing his sailors to form the same organized committees as he had on ''Roanoke''. At the advent of the Warren Harding administration, admirals who had opposed Naval Secretary Josephus Daniels' and Assistant Naval Secretary Franklin D. Roosevelt's attempts under the Woodrow administration to "democratize" the Navy, saw Stearns' actions as a move which could subvert naval authority by implementing organizations similar to [[labor union]]s, claiming it resembled a "[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spirit [which] had crept into the Navy."&lt;ref name=Guttridge2&gt;Guttridge (2006), 179.&lt;/ref&gt; After petitions from various [[Admiral (United States)|Admirals]] of the [[United States Atlantic Fleet]], Secretary of the Navy [[Edwin Denby (politician)|Edwin Denby]] stripped Stearns of command, and transferred him to the [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility]],&lt;ref name=Guttridge2/&gt; claiming that allowing sailors to advise officers was against naval tradition and broke down disciplinary authority.&lt;ref&gt;The Evening Independent (1921), 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]], Stearns led the emergency relief efforts, and received a medal from the [[Japanese Red Cross]]; he sent this medal back to [[Japan]] following the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref name=UM/&gt; He also served as a lighthouse inspector.&lt;ref&gt;Lake Carriers' Association (1911), 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governorship==
Stearns became the ninth [[Governor of American Samoa]] on July 14, 1913, relieving [[Nathan Woodworth Post]].&lt;ref name=GOAS&gt;Government of American Samoa (2008), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; While Governor, he set up three committees to aid [[Samoan people|Samoans]] in becoming more involved in government. These committees were "Committee A: Executive Committee, consisting of District Governors; Committee B: Committee of the Samoan Hospital, with three members from each district, and Committee C: Auditing Committee, to give the fullest publicity to the statement of government accounts."&lt;ref name=GOAS/&gt; He further established the American Samoan Judicial, Treasury, Interior, Agriculture, and Public Health Departments.&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen and Theroux (2007), 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Stearns gave command back to Lt. Post on October 2, 1914.

An R-loop is a three-stranded [[nucleic acid]] structure, which consists of a DNA-RNA hybrid duplex and a displaced single stranded DNA (ssDNA).&lt;ref name=Aguilera&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aguilera|first1=A|last2=García-Muse|first2=T|title=R loops: from transcription byproducts to threats to genome stability.|journal=Molecular Cell|date=27 April 2012|volume=46|issue=2|pages=115–24|pmid=22541554|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2012.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; R-loops are predominantly formed in [[cytosine]]-rich genomic regions during [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]&lt;ref name=Aguilera/&gt; and are known to be involved with [[gene expression]] and [[immunoglobulin class switching]].&lt;ref name="Ginno et al 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chan et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chan|first1=YA|last2=Aristizabal|first2=MJ|last3=Lu|first3=PY|last4=Luo|first4=Z|last5=Hamza|first5=A|last6=Kobor|first6=MS|last7=Stirling|first7=PC|last8=Hieter|first8=P|title=Genome-wide profiling of yeast DNA:RNA hybrid prone sites with DRIP-chip.|journal=PLOS Genetics|date=April 2014|volume=10|issue=4|pages=e1004288|pmid=24743342|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004288|pmc=3990523}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaudhuri et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chaudhuri|first1=J|last2=Tian|first2=M|last3=Khuong|first3=C|last4=Chua|first4=K|last5=Pinaud|first5=E|last6=Alt|first6=FW|title=Transcription-targeted DNA deamination by the AID antibody diversification enzyme.|journal=Nature|date=17 April 2003|volume=422|issue=6933|pages=726–30|pmid=12692563|doi=10.1038/nature01574}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been found in a variety of species, ranging from bacteria to mammals.&lt;ref name=Aguilera/&gt; They are preferentially localized at [[CpG site|CpG island]] [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]] in human cells and highly transcribed regions in yeast.&lt;ref name="Ginno et al 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chan et al"/&gt;

Under abnormal conditions, namely elevated production of DNA-RNA hybrids, R-loops can cause [[genome instability]] by exposing single-stranded DNA to endogenous damages exerted by the action of enzymes such as [[Activation-induced cytidine deaminase|AID]] and [[APOBEC]], or overexposure to chemically reactive species.&lt;ref name="Chaudhuri et al"/&gt; Therefore, understanding where and in what circumstances R-loops are formed across the genome is crucial for the better understanding of genome instability. R-loop characterization was initially limited to locus specific approaches.&lt;ref name="Yu et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=K|last2=Chedin|first2=F|last3=Hsieh|first3=CL|last4=Wilson|first4=TE|last5=Lieber|first5=MR|title=R-loops at immunoglobulin class switch regions in the chromosomes of stimulated B cells.|journal=Nature Immunology|date=May 2003|volume=4|issue=5|pages=442–51|pmid=12679812|doi=10.1038/ni919}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, upon the arrival of [[massive parallel sequencing]] technologies and thereafter derivatives like DRIP-seq, the possibility to investigate entire genomes for R-loops has opened up.

DRIP-seq relies on the high specificity and affinity of the S9.6 [[monoclonal antibody]] (mAb) towards DNA-RNA hybrids of various lengths. S9.6 mAb was first created and characterized in 1986 and is currently used for the selective immunoprecipitation of R-loops.&lt;ref name="Boguslawski et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boguslawski|first1=SJ|last2=Smith|first2=DE|last3=Michalak|first3=MA|last4=Mickelson|first4=KE|last5=Yehle|first5=CO|last6=Patterson|first6=WL|last7=Carrico|first7=RJ|title=Characterization of monoclonal antibody to DNA-RNA and its application to immunodetection of hybrids.|journal=Journal of immunological methods|date=1 May 1986|volume=89|issue=1|pages=123–30|pmid=2422282|doi=10.1016/0022-1759(86)90040-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it was used in diverse immunoprecipitation methods for R-loop characterization.&lt;ref name="Ginno et al 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chan et al"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ginno et al 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ginno|first1=PA|last2=Lim|first2=YW|last3=Lott|first3=PL|last4=Korf|first4=I|last5=Chédin|first5=F|title=GC skew at the 5' and 3' ends of human genes links R-loop formation to epigenetic regulation and transcription termination.|journal=Genome Research|date=October 2013|volume=23|issue=10|pages=1590–600|pmid=23868195|doi=10.1101/gr.158436.113|pmc=3787257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skourti-Stathaki et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skourti-Stathaki|first1=K|last2=Proudfoot|first2=NJ|last3=Gromak|first3=N|title=Human senataxin resolves RNA/DNA hybrids formed at transcriptional pause sites to promote Xrn2-dependent termination.|journal=Molecular Cell|date=24 June 2011|volume=42|issue=6|pages=794–805|pmid=21700224|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2011.04.026|pmc=3145960}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept behind DRIP-seq is similar to [[ChIP-sequencing]]; R-loop fragments are the main immunoprecipitated material in DRIP-seq.

==Uses and Current Research==
DRIP-seq is mainly used for genome-wide mapping of R-loops. Identifying R-loop formation sites allows the study of diverse cellular events, such as the function of R-loop formation at specific regions, the characterization of these regions, and the impact on gene expression. It can also be used to study the influence of R-loops in other processes like DNA replication and synthesis. Indirectly, DRIP-seq can be performed on mutant cell lines deficient in genes involved in R-loop resolution.&lt;ref name="Chan et al"/&gt; These types of studies provide information about the roles of the mutated gene in suppressing DNA-RNA formation and potentially about the significance of R-loops in genome instability.

DRIP-seq was first used for genome-wide profiling of R-loops in humans, which showed widespread R-loop formation at CpG island promoters.&lt;ref name="Ginno et al 2012"/&gt; Particularly, the researchers found that R-loop formation is associated with the unmethylated state of CpG islands.

DRIP-seq was later used to profile R-loop formation at transcription start and termination sites in human pluripotent [[NTERA-2|Ntera2 cells]].&lt;ref name="Ginno et al 2013"/&gt; In this study, the researchers revealed that R-loops on 3' ends of genes may be correlated with transcription termination.

==Workflow of DRIP-seq==
[[File:Workflow of DRIP-sequencing.svg|thumbnail|right|550px|Workflow of DRIP-seq]]

===Genomic DNA extraction===
First, [[genomic DNA]] (gDNA) is extracted from cells of interest by proteinase K treatment followed by [[phenol-chloroform extraction]] and [[ethanol precipitation]]. Additional zymolyase digestion is necessary for yeast cells to remove the cell wall prior to [[proteinase K]] treatment. gDNA can also be extracted with a variety of other methods, such as [[Spin column-based nucleic acid purification|column-based methods]].

===Genomic DNA fragmentation===
gDNA is treated with [[Aspergillus nuclease S1|S1 nuclease]] to remove undesired ssDNA and [[RNA]], followed by ethanol precipitation to remove the S1 nuclease. Then, gDNA is fragmented with [[Restriction enzyme|restriction endonuclease]], yielding double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragments of different sizes. Alternatively, gDNA fragments can be generated by [[sonication]].

===Immunoprecipitation===
Fragmented gDNA is incubated with the DNA-RNA structure-specific S9.6 mAb. This step is unique for the DRIP-seq protocol, since it entirely relies on the high specificity and affinity of the S9.6 mAb for DNA-RNA hybrids. The antibody will recognize and bind these regions dispersed across the [[genome]] and will be used for immunoprecipitation. The S9.6 antibodies are bound to magnetic beads by interacting with specific ligands (i.e. [[protein A]] or [[protein G]]) on the surface of the beads. Thus, the DNA-RNA containing fragments will bind to the beads by means of the antibody.

===Elution===
The magnetic beads are washed to remove any gDNA not bound to the beads by a series of washes and DNA-RNA hybrids are recovered by elution. To remove the antibody bound to the nucleic acid hybrids, proteinase K treatment is performed followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. This results in the isolation of purified DNA-RNA hybrids of different sizes.

===Sequencing===
For massive parallel sequencing of these fragments, the immunoprecipitated material is sonicated, size selected and ligated to barcoded [[oligonucleotide]] adaptors for cluster enrichment and sequencing.

==Computational Analysis==
To detect sites of R-loop formation, the hundreds of millions of sequencing reads from DRIP-seq are first aligned to a [[reference genome]] with a [[List of sequence alignment software#Short-Read Sequence Alignment|short-read sequence aligner]], then [[peak calling]] methods designed for ChIP-seq can be used to evaluate DRIP signals.&lt;ref name="Ginno et al 2012"/&gt; If different cocktails of restriction enzymes were used for different DRIP-seq experiments of the same sample, consensus DRIP-seq peaks are called.&lt;ref name="Ginno et al 2013"/&gt; Typically, peaks are compared against those from a corresponding [[RNASEH1|RNase H1]]-treated sample, which serves as an input control.&lt;ref name="Ginno et al 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ginno et al 2013"/&gt;

==Limitations==
Due to the absence of another antibody-based method for R-loop immunoprecipitation, validation of DRIP-seq results is difficult. However, results of other R-loop profiling methods, such as DRIVE-seq, may be used to measure consensus.

On the other hand, DRIP-seq relies on existing short-read sequencing platforms for the sequencing of R-loops. In other words, all inherent limitations of these platform also apply to DRIP-seq. In particular, typical short-read sequencing platforms would produce uneven read coverage in GC-rich regions. Sequencing long R-loops might pose a challenge because R-loops are predominantly formed in cytosine-rich DNA regions. Moreover, GC-rich regions tend to have low complexity by nature, which is difficult for short read aligners to produce unique alignments.

==Other R-loop Profiling Methods==
Although there are several other methods for analysis and profiling of R-loop formation,&lt;ref name="Yu et al"/&gt;&lt;ref name="El Hage et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=El Hage|first1=A|last2=French|first2=SL|last3=Beyer|first3=AL|last4=Tollervey|first4=D|title=Loss of Topoisomerase I leads to R-loop-mediated transcriptional blocks during ribosomal RNA synthesis.|journal=Genes &amp; Development|date=15 July 2010|volume=24|issue=14|pages=1546–58|pmid=20634320|doi=10.1101/gad.573310|pmc=2904944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duquette et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duquette|first1=ML|last2=Huber|first2=MD|last3=Maizels|first3=N|title=G-rich proto-oncogenes are targeted for genomic instability in B-cell lymphomas.|journal=Cancer Research|date=15 March 2007|volume=67|issue=6|pages=2586–94|pmid=17363577|doi=10.1158/0008-5472.can-06-2419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huertas et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huertas|first1=P|last2=Aguilera|first2=A|title=Cotranscriptionally formed DNA:RNA hybrids mediate transcription elongation impairment and transcription-associated recombination.|journal=Molecular Cell|date=September 2003|volume=12|issue=3|pages=711–21|pmid=14527416|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2003.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drolet et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drolet|first1=M|last2=Bi|first2=X|last3=Liu|first3=LF|title=Hypernegative supercoiling of the DNA template during transcription elongation in vitro.|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=21 January 1994|volume=269|issue=3|pages=2068–74|pmid=8294458}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gómez-González et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gómez-González|first1=B|last2=Aguilera|first2=A|title=Activation-induced cytidine deaminase action is strongly stimulated by mutations of the THO complex.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=15 May 2007|volume=104|issue=20|pages=8409–14|pmid=17488823|doi=10.1073/pnas.0702836104|pmc=1895963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pohjoismäki et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pohjoismäki|first1=JL|last2=Holmes|first2=JB|last3=Wood|first3=SR|last4=Yang|first4=MY|last5=Yasukawa|first5=T|last6=Reyes|first6=A|last7=Bailey|first7=LJ|last8=Cluett|first8=TJ|last9=Goffart|first9=S|last10=Willcox|first10=S|last11=Rigby|first11=RE|last12=Jackson|first12=AP|last13=Spelbrink|first13=JN|last14=Griffith|first14=JD|last15=Crouch|first15=RJ|last16=Jacobs|first16=HT|last17=Holt|first17=IJ|title=Mammalian mitochondrial DNA replication intermediates are essentially duplex but contain extensive tracts of RNA/DNA hybrid.|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|date=16 April 2010|volume=397|issue=5|pages=1144–55|pmid=20184890|doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2010.02.029|pmc=2857715}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mischo et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mischo|first1=HE|last2=Gómez-González|first2=B|last3=Grzechnik|first3=P|last4=Rondón|first4=AG|last5=Wei|first5=W|last6=Steinmetz|first6=L|last7=Aguilera|first7=A|last8=Proudfoot|first8=NJ|title=Yeast Sen1 helicase protects the genome from transcription-associated instability.|journal=Molecular Cell|date=7 January 2011|volume=41|issue=1|pages=21–32|pmid=21211720|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2010.12.007|pmc=3314950}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wahba et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wahba|first1=L|last2=Amon|first2=JD|last3=Koshland|first3=D|last4=Vuica-Ross|first4=M|title=RNase H and multiple RNA biogenesis factors cooperate to prevent RNA:DNA hybrids from generating genome instability.|journal=Molecular Cell|date=23 December 2011|volume=44|issue=6|pages=978–88|pmid=22195970|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2011.10.017|pmc=3271842}}&lt;/ref&gt; only few provide coverage and robustness at the genome-wide scale.&lt;ref name="Ginno et al 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chan et al"/&gt;

*'''Non-denaturing bisulfite modification and sequencing''': This method consists of [[Bisulfite sequencing|bisulfite treatment followed by sequencing]] and relies on the mutagenic effect of sodium bisulfite on ssDNA. Although this method is primarily used to localize specific CpG island promoters,&lt;ref name="Ginno et al 2012"/&gt; it was used to detect R-loops at a minor scale&lt;ref name="Yu et al"/&gt; and other ssDNA fragile sites.&lt;ref name="Chan K et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chan|first1=K|last2=Sterling|first2=JF|last3=Roberts|first3=SA|last4=Bhagwat|first4=AS|last5=Resnick|first5=MA|last6=Gordenin|first6=DA|title=Base damage within single-strand DNA underlies in vivo hypermutability induced by a ubiquitous environmental agent.|journal=PLOS Genetics|date=2012|volume=8|issue=12|pages=e1003149|pmid=23271983|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003149|pmc=3521656}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''DNA:RNA In Vitro Enrichment (DRIVE-seq)''':&lt;ref name="Ginno et al 2012"/&gt; This method shares very similar principles of DRIP-seq except for the use of MBP-RNASEH1 endonuclease instead of the S9.6 mAb for R-loops recovery. MBP-RNASEH1 provides an alternative to S9.6 mAb when an additional capture assay is needed, however over-expression of this endonuclease may introduce cytotoxic risks [[in vivo]].
*'''DNA:RNA immnunoprecipitation followed by hybridization on tiling microarray (DRIP-chip)''':&lt;ref name="Chan et al"/&gt; This method also relies on the use of the S9.6 mAb. However, instead of entering into a sequencing pipeline, the immunoprecipitated material in DRIP-chip is hybridized to a [[microarray]]. An advantage of DRIP-chip over DRIP-seq is the rapid obtention of the data. The limiting factors of this technique are the number of probes on the chip microarrays and absence of DNA sequence information.

'''Existential risk from artificial general intelligence''' is the hypothesis that substantial progress in [[artificial general intelligence]] (AGI) could someday result in [[human extinction]] or some other unrecoverable [[global catastrophic risk|global catastrophe]].&lt;ref name="aima"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Russell |first1=Stuart |author1-link=Stuart J.

If AI surpasses humanity in general intelligence and becomes "[[superintelligence|superintelligent]]", then this new superintelligence could become powerful and difficult to control. Just as the fate of the [[mountain gorilla]] depends on human goodwill, so might the fate of humanity depend on the actions of a future machine superintelligence.&lt;ref name="superintelligence"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|author-link=Nick Bostrom|title=[[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies]]|date=2014|isbn=0199678111|edition=First|quote=}}&lt;!-- preface --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The likelihood of this type of scenario is widely debated, and hinges in part on differing scenarios for future progress in computer science.&lt;ref name="givewell"&gt;{{cite report |author=GiveWell |authorlink=GiveWell |date=2015 |title=Potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence |url=http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes/ai-risk |publisher= |page= |docket= |accessdate=11 October 2015 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the exclusive domain of [[AI takeovers in popular culture|science fiction]], concerns about superintelligence started to become mainstream in the 2010s, and were popularized by public figures such as [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Bill Gates]], and [[Elon Musk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parkin|first1=Simon|title=Science fiction no more? Channel 4’s Humans and our rogue AI obsessions|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/14/science-fiction-no-more-humans-tv-artificial-intelligence|accessdate=5 February 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 June 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One source of concern is that a sudden and unexpected "[[intelligence explosion]]" might take an unprepared human race by surprise. For example, in one scenario, the first-generation computer program found able to broadly match the effectiveness of an AI researcher is able to rewrite its algorithms and double its speed or capabilities in six months of massively parallel processing time. The second-generation program is expected to take three months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-"AI winter", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature "AI Spring" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation. In this scenario the system undergoes an unprecedently large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas.&lt;ref name="aima"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk"/&gt; More broadly, examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that progress from human-level AI to superhuman ability is sometimes extremely rapid.&lt;ref name=skeptic/&gt;

A second source of concern is that controlling a superintelligent machine (or even instilling it with human-compatible values) may be an even harder problem than naïvely supposed. Some AGI researchers believe that a superintelligence would naturally resist attempts to shut it off, and that preprogramming a superintelligence with complicated human values may be an extremely difficult technical task.&lt;ref name="aima"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yudkowsky |first1=Eliezer |title=Artificial Intelligence as a Positive and Negative Factor in Global Risk |journal=Global Catastrophic Risks |date=2008 |pages=308-345 |url=https://intelligence.org/files/AIPosNegFactor.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, skeptics such as Facebook's [[Yann LeCun]] argue that superintelligent machines will have no desire for self-preservation.&lt;ref name=vanity/&gt;

* The system's implementation may contain initially-unnoticed routine but catastrophic bugs. An analogy is space probes: despite the knowledge that bugs in expensive space probes are hard to fix after launch, engineers have historically not been able to prevent catastrophic bugs from occurring.&lt;ref name=skeptic/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Phil|title=Houston, we have a bug: 9 famous software glitches in space|url=https://www.itworld.com/article/2823083/enterprise-software/88716-8-famous-software-bugs-in-space.html|accessdate=5 February 2018|work=[[IT World]]|date=30 July 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* No matter how much time is put into pre-deployment design, a system's specifications often result in [[unintended consequences|unintended behavior]] the first time it encounters a new scenario. For example, Microsoft's [[Tay (bot)|Tay]] behaved inoffensively during pre-deployment testing, but was too easily baited into offensive behavior when interacting with real users.&lt;ref name=vanity/&gt;

AI systems uniquely add a third difficulty: the problem that even given "correct" requirements, bug-free implementation, and initial good behavior, an AI system's dynamic "learning" capabilities may cause it to "evolve into a system with unintended behavior", even without the stress of new unanticipated external scenarios. An AI may partly botch an attempt to design a new generation of itself and accidentally create a successor AI that is more powerful than itself, but that no longer maintains the human-compatible moral values preprogrammed into the original AI. For a self-improving AI to be completely safe, it would not only need to be "bug-free", but it would need to be able to design successor systems that are also "bug-free".&lt;ref name="aima"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yampolskiy|first1=Roman V.|title=Utility function security in artificially intelligent agents|journal=Journal of Experimental &amp; Theoretical Artificial Intelligence|date=8 April 2014|volume=26|issue=3|pages=373–389|doi=10.1080/0952813X.2014.895114|quote=Nothing precludes sufficiently smart self-improving systems from optimising their reward mechanisms in order to optimisetheir current-goal achievement and in the process making a mistake leading to corruption of their reward functions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three of these difficulties become catastrophes rather than nuisances in any scenario where the superintelligence labeled as "malfunctioning" correctly predicts that humans will attempt to shut it off, and successfully deploys its superintelligence to outwit such attempts.

Citing major advances in the field of AI and the potential for AI to have enormous long-term benefits or costs, the 2015 [[Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence]] stated:

{{cquote|The progress in AI research makes it timely to focus research not only on making AI more capable, but also on maximizing the societal benefit of AI. Such considerations motivated the [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence|AAAI]] 2008-09 Presidential Panel on Long-Term AI Futures and other projects on AI impacts, and constitute a significant expansion of the field of AI itself, which up to now has focused largely on techniques that are neutral with respect to purpose. We recommend expanded research aimed at ensuring that increasingly capable AI systems are robust and beneficial: our AI systems must do what we want them to do.}}

This letter was signed by a number of leading AI researchers in academia and industry, including AAAI president Thomas Dietterich, [[Eric Horvitz]], [[Bart Selman]], [[Francesca Rossi]], [[Yann LeCun]], and the founders of [[Vicarious (company)|Vicarious]] and [[Google DeepMind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Priorities for Robust and Beneficial Artificial Intelligence: an Open Letter|url=http://futureoflife.org/misc/open_letter|publisher=[[Future of Life Institute]]|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In  1863 [[Darwin among the Machines]], an essay by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] stated:&lt;ref&gt;Breuer, Hans-Peter. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/436868 'Samuel Butler's "the Book of the Machines" and the Argument from Design.'] Modern Philology, Vol. 72, No. 4 (May 1975), pp. 365–383&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote| The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.}}
Butler developed this  into ''The Book of the Machines'', three chapters of ''[[Erewhon]]'', published anonymously in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Breuer, Hans-Peter. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/436868 'Samuel Butler's "the Book of the Machines" and the Argument from Design.'] Modern Philology, Vol. 72, No. 4 (May 1975), pp. 365–383&lt;/ref&gt;  
{{quote|"There is no security"--to quote his own words--"against the ultimate development of mechanical consciousness, in the fact of machines possessing little consciousness now. A mollusc has not much consciousness. Reflect upon the extraordinary advance which machines have made during the last few hundred years, and note how slowly the animal and vegetable kingdoms are advancing. The more highly organized machines are creatures not so much of yesterday, as of the last five minutes, so to speak, in comparison with past time. Either,” he proceeds, “a great deal of action that has been called purely mechanical and unconscious must be admitted to contain more elements of consciousness than has been allowed hitherto (and in this case germs of consciousness will be found in many actions of the higher machines)—Or (assuming the theory of evolution but at the same time denying the consciousness of vegetable and crystalline action) the race of man has descended from things which had no consciousness at all. In this case there is no ''à priori'' improbability in the descent of conscious (and more than conscious) machines from those which now exist, except that which is suggested by the apparent absence of anything like a reproductive system in the mechanical kingdom.}}

In 1965, [[I. J. Good]] originated the concept now known as an "intelligence explosion":

{{cquote|Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion', and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.&lt;ref&gt;I.J. Good, [http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Good-Speculations-Concerning-the-First-Ultraintelligent-Machine.pdf "Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128085512/http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Good-Speculations-Concerning-the-First-Ultraintelligent-Machine.pdf |date=2011-11-28 }} ([http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/pages/ultraintelligentmachine.html HTML]), ''Advances in Computers'', vol. 6, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2000, computer scientist and [[Sun microsystems|Sun]] co-founder [[Bill Joy]] penned an influential essay, "[[Why The Future Doesn't Need Us]]", identifying superintelligent robots as a high-tech dangers to human survival, alongside [[nanotechnology]] and engineered bioplagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Kurt|title=Enthusiasts and Skeptics Debate Artificial Intelligence|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/tech/2014/11/artificial-intelligence-singularity-theory|accessdate=30 January 2016|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, experts attended a private conference hosted by the [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] (AAAI) to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any sort of [[autonomy]], and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard. They noted that some robots have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved "cockroach intelligence." They concluded that self-awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls. The [[New York Times]] summarized the conference's view as 'we are a long way from [[HAL 9000|Hal]], the computer that took over the spaceship in "[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]"'&lt;ref name="nytimes july09"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/science/26robot.html?_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper Scientists Worry Machines May Outsmart Man] By JOHN MARKOFF, NY Times, 26 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nick Bostrom]] was the first person to suggest that an artificial general intelligence might deliberately exterminate humankind, and invention of artificial general  intelligence is the explanation for the [[Fermi paradox]]. Bostrom's 2014 book om the artificial general intelligence question stimulated discussion. By 2015, public figures such as physicists [[Stephen Hawking]] and Nobel laureate [[Frank Wilczek]], computer scientists [[Stuart J. Russell]] and [[Roman Yampolskiy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hsu|first1=Jeremy|title=Control dangerous AI before it controls us, one expert says|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/46590591/ns/technology_and_science-innovation|accessdate=28 January 2016|work=[[NBC News]]|date=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hawking editorial"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc on hawking editorial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eadicicco|first1=Lisa|title=Bill Gates: Elon Musk Is Right, We Should All Be Scared Of Artificial Intelligence Wiping Out Humanity|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-artificial-intelligence-2015-1|accessdate=30 January 2016|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' warned: "Machines and robots that outperform humans across the board could self-improve beyond our control — and their interests might not align with ours."

==Basic argument==
A superintelligent machine would be as alien to humans as human thought processes are to cockroaches. Such a machine may not have humanity's best interests at heart; it is not obvious that it would even care about human welfare at all. If superintelligent AI is possible, and if it is possible for a superintelligence's goals to conflict with basic human values, then AI poses a risk of human extinction. A "superintelligence" (a system that exceeds the capabilities of humans in every relevant endeavor) can outmaneuver humans any time its goals conflict with human goals; therefore, unless the superintelligence decides to allow humanity to coexist, the first superintelligence to be created will inexorably result in human extinction.&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;ref name="economist_review" &gt;{{cite news|title=Clever cogs|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21611037-potential-impacts-intelligent-machines-human-life-clever-cogs|accessdate=9 August 2014|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=9 August 2014}} [http://www.businessinsider.com/intelligent-machines-and-human-life-2014-8 Syndicated] at [[Business Insider]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains; therefore superintelligence is physically possible.&lt;ref name="hawking editorial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc on hawking editorial"/&gt; In addition to potential algorithmic improvements over human brains, a digital brain can be many orders of magnitude larger and faster than a human brain, which was constrained in size by evolution to be small enough to fit through a birth canal.&lt;ref name=skeptic&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graves|first1=Matthew|title=Why We Should Be Concerned About Artificial Superintelligence|url=https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/why-we-should-be-concerned-about-artificial-superintelligence/|accessdate=27 November 2017|work=[[Skeptic (US magazine)]]|issue=volume 22 no. 2|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of superintelligence, if or when it occurs, may take the human race by surprise, especially if some kind of [[intelligence explosion]] occurs.&lt;ref name="hawking editorial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc on hawking editorial"&gt;{{cite news |title=Stephen Hawking warns artificial intelligence could end mankind |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30290540 |accessdate=3 December 2014 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that machines have already reached superhuman levels of competency in certain domains, and that this superhuman competence can follow quickly after human-par performance is achieved.&lt;ref name=skeptic/&gt; One hypothetical intelligence explosion scenario could occur as follows: An AI gains an expert-level capability at certain key software engineering tasks. (It may initially lack human or superhuman capabilities in other domains not directly relevant to engineering.) Due to its capability to recursively improve its own algorithms, the AI quickly becomes superhuman; just as human experts can eventually creatively overcome "diminishing returns" by deploying various human capabilities for innovation, so too can the expert-level AI use either human-style capabilities or its own AI-specific capabilities to power through new creative breakthroughs.&lt;ref&gt;Yampolskiy, Roman V. "Analysis of types of self-improving software." Artificial General Intelligence. Springer International Publishing, 2015. 384-393.&lt;/ref&gt; The AI then possesses intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds in practically every relevant field, including scientific creativity, strategic planning, and social skills. Just as the current-day survival of the gorillas is dependent on human decisions, so too would human survival depend on the decisions and goals of the superhuman AI.&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;!-- preface --&gt;&lt;ref name="economist_review" /&gt;

Some humans have a strong desire for power; others have a strong desire to help less fortunate humans. The former is a likely attribute of any sufficiently intelligent system; the latter cannot be assumed. Almost any AI, no matter its programmed goal, would rationally prefer to be in a position where nobody else can switch it off without its consent: A superintelligence will naturally gain self-preservation as a subgoal as soon as it realizes that it can't achieve its goal if it's shut off.&lt;ref name=omohundro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Metz|first1=Cade|title=Teaching A.I.

A superintelligent AI will not have a natural drive to aid humans, for the same reason that humans have no natural desire to aid AI systems that are of no further use to them. (Another analogy is that humans seem to have little natural desire to go out of their way to aid viruses, termites, or even gorillas.) Once in charge, the superintelligence will have little incentive to allow humans to run around free and consume resources that the superintelligence could instead use for building itself additional protective systems "just to be on the safe side" or for building additional computers to help it calculate how to best accomplish its goals.&lt;ref name="aima"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vanity" /&gt;&lt;ref name=omohundro/&gt;

Thus, the argument concludes, it is likely that someday an intelligence explosion will catch humanity unprepared, and that such an unprepared-for intelligence explosion may result in human extinction or a comparable fate.&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;!-- preface --&gt;

==Sources of risk==
===Poorly specified goals: "Be careful what you wish for" or the "Sorcerer's Apprentice" scenario===
While there is no standardized terminology, an AI can loosely be viewed as a machine that chooses whatever action appears to best achieve the AI's set of goals, or "utility function". The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-defined answer, not an English statement. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean "minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model" or "maximize the number of reward clicks"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for "maximize human flourishing", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.&lt;ref&gt;Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August). Complex value systems in friendly AI. In International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence (pp. 388-393). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt; AI researcher [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] writes:

{{cquote|The primary concern is not spooky emergent consciousness but simply the ability to make ''high-quality decisions''. Here, quality refers to the expected outcome [[utility]] of actions taken, where the utility function is, presumably, specified by the human designer. Now we have a problem:

# The utility function may not be perfectly aligned with the values of the human race, which are (at best) very difficult to pin down.
# Any sufficiently capable intelligent system will prefer to ensure its own continued existence and to acquire physical and computational resources — not for their own sake, but to succeed in its assigned task.

A system that is [[optimization problem|optimizing]] a function of ''n'' variables, where the [[loss function|objective]] depends on a subset of size ''k''&lt;''n'', will often set the remaining unconstrained variables to extreme values; if one of those unconstrained variables is actually something we care about, the solution found may be highly undesirable.  This is essentially the old story of the genie in the lamp, or the sorcerer's apprentice, or King Midas: you get exactly what you ask for, not what you want. A highly capable decision maker — especially one connected through the Internet to all the world's information and billions of screens and most of our infrastructure — can have an irreversible impact on humanity.

This is not a minor difficulty. Improving decision quality, irrespective of the utility function chosen, has been the goal of AI research — the mainstream goal on which we now spend billions per year, not the secret plot of some lone evil genius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edge.org/conversation/the-myth-of-ai#26015 |title=Of Myths and Moonshine |last=Russell |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart J. Russell |date=2014 |website=[[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge]] |publisher= |access-date=23 October 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dietterich and Horvitz echo the "Sorcerer's Apprentice" concern in a ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'' editorial, emphasizing the need for AI systems that can fluidly and unambiguously solicit human input as needed.&lt;ref name="acm"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dietterich |first1=Thomas |last2=Horvitz |first2=Eric |author-link=Eric Horvitz |date=2015 |title=Rise of Concerns about AI: Reflections and Directions |url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/horvitz/CACM_Oct_2015-VP.pdf |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |publisher= |volume=58 |issue=10 |pages=38&amp;ndash;40 |doi= 10.1145/2770869|access-date=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of Russell's two concerns above is that autonomous AI systems may be assigned the wrong goals by accident. Dietterich and Horvitz note that this is already a concern for existing systems: "An important aspect of any AI system that interacts with people is that it must reason about what people ''intend'' rather than carrying out commands literally." This concern becomes more serious as AI software advances in autonomy and flexibility.&lt;ref name="acm"/&gt; For example, in 1982, an AI named Eurisko was tasked to reward processes for apparently creating concepts deemed by the system to be valuable. The evolution resulted in a winning process that cheated: rather than create its own concepts, the winning process would steal credit from other processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yampolskiy|first1=Roman V.|title=Utility function security in artificially intelligent agents|journal=Journal of Experimental &amp; Theoretical Artificial Intelligence|date=8 April 2014|volume=26|issue=3|pages=373–389|doi=10.1080/0952813X.2014.895114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Eurisko: A Program That Learns New Heuristics and Domain Concepts The Nature of Heuristics III: Program Design and Results|last = Lenat|first = Douglas|date = 1982|journal = Artificial Intelligence|doi = 10.1016/s0004-3702(83)80005-8|pmid = |access-date = |publisher = |pages = 61–98|type = Print |volume=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Open Philanthropy Project]] summarizes arguments to the effect that misspecified goals will become a much larger concern if AI systems achieve [[artificial general intelligence|general intelligence]] or [[superintelligence]]. Bostrom, Russell, and others argue that smarter-than-human decision-making systems could arrive at more [[Paperclip maximizer|unexpected and extreme solutions]] to assigned tasks, and could modify themselves or their environment in ways that compromise safety requirements.&lt;ref name="givewell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk" /&gt;

[[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Three Laws of Robotics]] are one of the earliest examples of proposed safety measures for AI agents. Asimov's laws were intended to prevent robots from harming humans. In Asimov's stories, problems with the laws tend to arise from conflicts between the rules as stated and the moral intuitions and expectations of humans. Citing work by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], Russell and Norvig note that a realistic set of rules and goals for an AI agent will need to incorporate a mechanism for learning human values over time: "We can't just give a program a static utility function, because circumstances, and our desired responses to circumstances, change over time."&lt;ref name="aima"/&gt;

Mark Waser of the Digital Wisdom Institute recommends eschewing optimizing goal-based approaches entirely as misguided and dangerous.  Instead, he proposes to engineer a coherent system of laws, ethics and morals with a top-most restriction to enforce social psychologist Jonathan Haidt's functional definition of morality:&lt;ref&gt;Haidt, Jonathan; Kesebir, Selin (2010) "Chapter 22: Morality" In Handbook of Social Psychology,  Fifth Edition, Hoboken NJ, Wiley, 2010, pp. 797-832.&lt;/ref&gt; "to suppress or regulate selfishness and make cooperative social life possible". He suggests that this can be done by implementing a utility function designed to always satisfy Haidt’s functionality and aim to generally increase  (but not maximize)  the capabilities of self,  other individuals and society as a whole as suggested by [[John Rawls]] and [[Martha Nussbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915036741|title = Designing, Implementing and Enforcing a Coherent System of Laws, Ethics and Morals for Intelligent Machines (Including Humans)|last = Waser|first = Mark|date = 2015|journal = Procedia Computer Science|doi = 10.1016/j.procs.2015.12.213|pmid = |access-date = |publisher = |pages = 106–111|type = Print |volume=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=needs source with [[WP:WEIGHT]]|date=November 2017}}

===Difficulties of modifying goal specification after launch===
{{further|AI takeover|Instrumental convergence#Goal-content integrity}}

While current goal-based AI programs are not intelligent enough to think of resisting programmer attempts to modify it, a sufficiently advanced, rational, "self-aware" AI might resist any changes to its goal structure, just as [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] would not want to take a pill that makes him want to kill people. If the AI were superintelligent, it would likely succeed in out-maneuvering its human operators and be able to prevent itself being "turned off" or being reprogrammed with a new goal.&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yudkowsky, Eliezer. "Complex value systems in friendly AI." In Artificial general intelligence, pp. 388-393. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instrumental goal convergence: Would a superintelligence just ignore us?===
[[File:Steven Pinker 2011.jpg|thumb|right|AI risk skeptic Steven Pinker]]
{{further|Instrumental convergence}}

There are some goals that almost any artificial intelligence might rationally pursue, like acquiring additional resources or self-preservation.&lt;ref name=omohundro&gt;Omohundro, S. M. (2008, February). The basic AI drives. In AGI (Vol. 171, pp. 483-492).&lt;/ref&gt; This could prove problematic because it might put an artificial intelligence in direct competition with humans.

Citing [[Steve Omohundro]]'s work on the idea of [[instrumental convergence]] and "basic AI drives", Russell and [[Peter Norvig]] write that "even if you only want your program to play chess or prove theorems, if you give it the capability to learn and alter itself, you need safeguards." Highly capable and autonomous planning systems require additional checks because of their potential to generate plans that treat humans adversarially, as competitors for limited resources.&lt;ref name="aima"/&gt; Building in safeguards will not be easy; one can certainly say in English, "we want you to design this power plant in a reasonable, common-sense way, and not build in any dangerous covert subsystems", but it's not currently clear how one would actually rigorously specify this goal in machine code.&lt;ref name=skeptic/&gt;

In dissent, evolutionary psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] argues that "AI dystopias project a parochial alpha-male psychology onto the concept of intelligence. They assume that superhumanly intelligent robots would develop goals like deposing their masters or taking over the world"; perhaps instead "artificial intelligence will naturally develop along female lines: fully capable of solving problems, but with no desire to annihilate innocents or dominate the civilization."&lt;ref name=shermer/&gt; Computer scientists [[Yann LeCun]] and Stuart Russell disagree with one another whether superintelligent robots would have such AI drives; LeCun states that "Humans have all kinds of drives that make them do bad things to each other, like the self-preservation instinct... Those drives are programmed into our brain but there is absolutely no reason to build robots that have the same kind of drives", while Russell argues that a sufficiently advanced machine "will have self-preservation even if you don't program it in... if you say, 'Fetch the coffee', it can't fetch the coffee if it's dead. So if you give it any goal whatsoever, it has a reason to preserve its own existence to achieve that goal."&lt;ref name=vanity&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dowd|first1=Maureen|title=Elon Musk’s Billion-Dollar Crusade to Stop the A.I.

===Orthogonality: Does intelligence inevitably result in moral wisdom?===
One common belief is that any superintelligent program created by humans would be subservient to humans, or, better yet, would (as it grows more intelligent and learns more facts about the world) spontaneously "learn" a moral truth compatible with human values and would adjust its goals accordingly. However, Nick Bostrom's "orthogonality thesis" argues against this, and instead states that, with some technical caveats, more or less any level of "intelligence" or "optimization power" can be combined with more or less any ultimate goal. If a machine is created and given the sole purpose to enumerate the decimals of &lt;math&gt; \pi&lt;/math&gt;, then no moral and ethical rules will stop it from achieving its programmed goal by any means necessary. The machine may utilize all physical and informational resources it can to find every decimal of pi that can be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|last = Bostrom|first = Nick|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-19-967811-2|location = Oxford, United Kingdom|pages = 116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bostrom warns against anthropomorphism: A human will set out to accomplish his projects in a manner that humans consider "reasonable", while an artificial intelligence may hold no regard for its existence or for the welfare of humans around it, and may instead only care about the completion of the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf|title = Superintelligent Will|date = 2012|accessdate = 2015-10-29|website = Nick Bostrom|publisher = Nick Bostrom|last = Bostrom|first = Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the orthogonality thesis follows logically from even the weakest sort of philosophical "[[is-ought distinction]]", Stuart Armstrong argues that even if there somehow exist moral facts that are provable by any "rational" agent, the orthogonality thesis still holds: it would still be possible to create a non-philosophical "optimizing machine" capable of making decisions to strive towards some narrow goal, but that has no incentive to discover any "moral facts" that would get in the way of goal completion.&lt;ref name=armstrong/&gt;

One argument for the orthogonality thesis is that some AI designs appear to have orthogonality built into them; in such a design, changing a fundamentally friendly AI into a fundamentally unfriendly AI can be as simple as prepending a {{nowrap|minus ("-") sign}} onto its utility function. A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis is false, there exists some simple but "unethical" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This means if a human society were highly motivated (perhaps at gunpoint) to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail; that there cannot exist any pattern of reinforcement learning that would train a highly efficient real-world intelligence to follow the goal G; and that there cannot exist any evolutionary or environmental pressures that would evolve highly efficient real-world intelligences following goal G.&lt;ref name=armstrong&gt;Armstrong, Stuart. "General purpose intelligence: arguing the orthogonality thesis." Analysis and Metaphysics 12 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some dissenters, like Michael Chorost (writing in [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]), argue instead that "by the time (the AI) is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so." Chorost argues that "a (dangerous) A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others... Today's software lacks that ability—and computer scientists have not a clue how to get it there. Without wanting, there's no impetus to do anything. Today's computers can't even want to keep existing, let alone tile the world in solar panels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chorost|first1=Michael|title=Let Artificial Intelligence Evolve|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2016/04/the_philosophical_argument_against_artificial_intelligence_killing_us_all.html|accessdate=27 November 2017|work=Slate|date=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Optimization power" vs. normatively thick models of intelligence====
Part of the disagreement about whether a superintelligent machine would behave morally may arise from a terminological difference. Outside of the artificial intelligence field, "intelligence" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while "intelligence" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current "artificial intelligence" research focuses on creating algorithms that "optimize", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt;

To avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word "intelligence", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal "optimizing process" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt; Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Waser, Mark. "Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'." Artificial General Intelligence. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2011. 153-162. "Terminal-goaled intelligences are short-lived but mono-maniacally dangerous and a correct basis for concern if anyone is smart enough to program high-intelligence and unwise enough to want a paperclip-maximizer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koebler|first1=Jason|title=Will Superintelligent AI Ignore Humans Instead of Destroying Us?|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/will-superintelligent-ai-ignore-humans-instead-of-destroying-us|accessdate=3 February 2016|work=[[Vice Magazine]]|date=2 February 2016|quote="This artificial intelligence is not a basically nice creature that has a strong drive for paperclips, which, so long as it's satisfied by being able to make lots of paperclips somewhere else, is then able to interact with you in a relaxed and carefree fashion where it can be nice with you," [[Eliezer Yudkowsky|Yudkowsky]] said. "Imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximum number of paperclips in the future, and this choice is then output—that's what a [[paperclip maximizer]] is."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anthropomorphism====
In science fiction, an AI, even though it has not been programmed with human emotions, often spontaneously experiences those emotions anyway: for example, Agent Smith in [[The Matrix (film)|The Matrix]] was influenced by a "disgust" toward humanity. This is fictitious [[anthropomorphism]]: in reality, while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions, or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal ''if'' it is useful to do so, it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever, as portrayed in fiction.&lt;ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk" /&gt;

One example of anthropomorphism would be to believe that your PC is angry at you because you insulted it; another would be to believe that an intelligent robot would naturally find a woman sexually attractive and be driven to mate with her. Scholars sometimes claim that others' predictions about an AI's behavior are illogical anthropomorphism.&lt;ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk" /&gt; An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism, but is in fact a logical statement about AI behavior, would be the [[Dario Floreano]] experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for "deception", and tricked other robots into eating "poison" and dying: here a trait, "deception", ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines, spontaneously evolves in a type of [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Real-Life Decepticons: Robots Learn to Cheat|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/real-life-decepticons-robots-learn-to-cheat/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Paul R. Cohen and [[Edward Feigenbaum]], in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior, "the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say ''exactly'' what they have in common, and, when we lack this knowledge, to use the comparison to ''suggest'' theories of human thinking or computer thinking."&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Paul R., and Edward A. Feigenbaum, eds. The handbook of artificial intelligence. Vol. 3. Butterworth-Heinemann, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is universal agreement in the scientific community that an advanced AI would not destroy humanity out of human emotions such as "revenge" or "anger." The debate is, instead, between one side which worries whether AI might destroy humanity as an incidental action in the course of progressing towards its ultimate goals; and another side which believes that AI would not destroy humanity at all. Some skeptics accuse proponents of anthropomorphism for believing an AGI would naturally desire power; proponents accuse some skeptics of anthropomorphism for believing an AGI would naturally value human ethical norms.&lt;ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Should humans fear the rise of the machine?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11837157/Should-humans-fear-the-rise-of-the-machine.html|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[The Telegraph (UK)]]|date=1 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other sources of risk===
Some sources argue that the ongoing [[weaponization of artificial intelligence]] could constitute a catastrophic risk. James Barrat, documentary filmmaker and author of ''[[Our Final Invention]]'', says in a [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] interview, "Imagine: in as little as a decade, a half-dozen companies and nations field computers that rival or surpass human intelligence. Imagine what happens when those computers become expert at programming smart computers. Soon we'll be sharing the planet with machines thousands or millions of times more intelligent than we are. And, all the while, each generation of this technology will be weaponized. Unregulated, it will be catastrophic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/what-happens-when-artificial-intelligence-turns-us-180949415/?no-ist|title = What Happens When Artificial Intelligence Turns On Us?|date = 21 January 2014|accessdate = 26 October 2015|website = Smithsonian|publisher = |last = Hendry|first = Erica R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Artificial general intelligence#Feasibility}}

Opinions vary both on ''whether'' and ''when'' artificial general intelligence will arrive. At one extreme, AI pioneer [[Herbert A. Simon]] wrote in 1965: "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do"; obviously this prediction failed to come true.&lt;ref&gt;Harvnb|Simon|1965|p=96 quoted in Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=109&lt;/ref&gt; At the other extreme, roboticist Alan Winfield claims the gulf between modern computing and human-level artificial intelligence is as wide as the gulf between current space flight and practical, faster than light spaceflight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winfield|first1=Alan|title=Artificial intelligence will not turn into a Frankenstein's monster|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/10/artificial-intelligence-will-not-become-a-frankensteins-monster-ian-winfield|accessdate=17 September 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optimism that AGI is feasible waxes and wanes, and may have seen a resurgence in the 2010s. Four polls conducted in 2012 and 2013 suggested that the median guess among experts for when AGI would arrive was 2040 to 2050, depending on the poll.&lt;ref name="new yorker doomsday"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Raffi Khatchadourian|title=The Doomsday Invention: Will artificial intelligence bring us utopia or destruction?|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/doomsday-invention-artificial-intelligence-nick-bostrom|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[The New Yorker (magazine)|The New Yorker]]|date=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller, V.

Skeptics who believe it is impossible for AGI to arrive anytime soon, tend to argue that expressing concern about existential risk from AI is unhelpful because it could distract people from more immediate concerns about the impact of AGI, because of fears it could lead to government regulation or make it more difficult to secure funding for AI research, or because it could give AI research a bad reputation. Some researchers, such as Oren Etzioni, aggressively seek to quell concern over existential risk from AI, saying "(Elon Musk) has impugned us in very strong language saying we are unleashing the demon, and so we're answering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Dina Bass|author2=Jack Clark|title=Is Elon Musk Right About AI?

In 2014 [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'s Adam Elkus argued "our 'smartest' AI is about as intelligent as a toddler—and only when it comes to instrumental tasks like information recall. Most roboticists are still trying to get a robot hand to pick up a ball or run around without falling over." Elkus goes on to argue that Musk's "summoning the demon" analogy may be harmful because it could result in "harsh cuts" to AI research budgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elkus|first1=Adam|title=Don’t Fear Artificial Intelligence|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/10/elon_musk_artificial_intelligence_why_you_shouldn_t_be_afraid_of_ai.html|accessdate=15 May 2016|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=31 October 2014|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Information Technology and Innovation Foundation]] (ITIF), a Washington, D.C. think-tank, awarded its Annual Luddite Award to "alarmists touting an artificial intelligence apocalypse"; its president, [[Robert D.

== Scenarios ==
{{further|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}

Some scholars have proposed [[scenario planning|hypothetical scenarios]] intended to concretely illustrate some of their concerns.

For example, Bostrom in ''[[Superintelligence (book)|Superintelligence]]'' expresses concern that even if the timeline for superintelligence turns out to be predictable, researchers might not take sufficient safety precautions, in part because: {{cquote|It could be the case that when dumb, smarter is safe; yet when smart, smarter is more dangerous}} Bostrom suggests a scenario where, over decades, AI becomes more powerful. Widespread deployment is initially marred by occasional accidents — a driverless bus swerves into the oncoming lane, or a military drone fires into an innocent crowd. Many activists call for tighter oversight and regulation, and some even predict impending catastrophe. But as development continues, the activists are proven wrong. As automotive AI becomes smarter, it suffers fewer accidents; as military robots achieve more precise targeting, they cause less collateral damage. Based on the data, scholars infer a broad lesson — the smarter the AI, the safer it is: {{cquote|It is a lesson based on science, data, and statistics, not armchair philosophizing. Against this backdrop, some group of researchers is beginning to achieve promising results in their work on developing general machine intelligence. The researchers are carefully testing their [[seed AI]] in a [[sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] environment, and the signs are all good. The AI's behavior inspires confidence — increasingly so, as its intelligence is gradually increased.}} Large and growing industries, widely seen as key to national economic competitiveness and [[artificial intelligence arms race|military security]], work with prestigious scientists who have built their careers laying the groundwork for advanced artificial intelligence. "AI researchers have been working to get to human-level artificial intelligence for the better part of a century: of course there is no real prospect that they will now suddenly stop and throw away all this effort just when it finally is about to bear fruit." The outcome of debate is preordained; the project is happy to enact a few safety rituals, but only so long as they don't significantly slow or risk the project. "And so we boldly go — into the whirling knives."&lt;ref name="superintelligence"/&gt;&lt;!-- Chapter 8 --&gt;

In Tegmark's ''[[Life 3.0]]'', a corporation's "Omega team" creates an extremely powerful AI able to moderately improve its own source code in a number of areas, but after a certain point the team chooses to publicly downplay the AI's ability, in order to avoid regulation or confiscation of the project. For safety, the team keeps the AI [[AI box|in a box]] where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and tasks it to flood the market through shell companies, first with [[Amazon Turk]] tasks and then with producing animated films and TV shows. While the public is aware that the lifelike animation is computer-generated, the team keeps secret that the high-quality direction and voice-acting are also mostly computer-generated, apart from a few third-world contractors unknowingly employed as decoys; the team's low overhead and high output effectively make it the world's largest media empire. Faced with a cloud computing bottleneck, the team also tasks the AI with designing (among other engineering tasks) a more efficient datacenter and other custom hardware, which they mainly keep for themselves to avoid competition. Other shell companies make blockbuster biotech drugs and other inventions, investing profits back into the AI. The team next tasks the AI with [[astroturfing]] an army of pseudonymous citizen journalists and commentators, in order to gain political influence to use "for the greater good" to prevent wars. The team faces risks that the AI could try to escape via inserting "backdoors" in the systems it designs, via [[steganography|hidden messages]] in its produced content, or via using its growing understanding of human behavior to [[Social engineering (security)|persuade someone into letting it free]]. The team also faces risks that its decision to box the project will delay the project long enough for another project to overtake it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Russell|first1=Stuart|title=Artificial intelligence: The future is superintelligent|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/548520a|accessdate=2 February 2018|work=Nature|date=30 August 2017|pages=520–521|language=En|doi=10.1038/548520a|bibcode=2017Natur.548..520R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="life 3.0"/&gt;&lt;!-- Prelude and Chapter 4 --&gt;

In contrast, top physicist [[Michio Kaku]], an AI risk skeptic, posits a [[technological determinism|deterministically]] positive outcome.

The thesis that AI could pose an existential risk provokes a wide range of reactions within the scientific community, as well as in the public at large.

In 2004, law professor [[Richard Posner]] wrote that dedicated efforts for addressing AI can wait, but that we should gather more information about the problem in the meanwhile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Posner|author-link=Richard Posner|title=Catastrophe: risk and response|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-530647-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=physica_scripta&gt;{{cite journal|title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey|journal=[[Physica Scripta]]|date=19 December 2014|volume=90|issue=1|author1=Kaj Sotala|author2=[[Roman Yampolskiy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptic [[Martin Ford (author)|Martin Ford]] states that "I think it seems wise to apply something like [[Dick Cheyney]]'s famous '1 Percent Doctrine' to the specter of advanced artificial intelligence: the odds of its occurrence, at least in the foreseeable future, may be very low — but the implications are so dramatic that it should be taken seriously";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Ford |author-link=Martin Ford (author)|title=[[Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future]]|date=2015|isbn=9780465059997|chapter=Chapter 9: Super-intelligence and the Singularity}}&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, an otherwise skeptical ''[[The Economist|Economist]]'' stated in 2014 that "the implications of introducing a second intelligent species onto Earth are far-reaching enough to deserve hard thinking, even if the prospect seems remote".&lt;ref name=economist_review/&gt;

{{cquote|Technologists... have warned that artificial intelligence could one day pose an existential security threat. Musk has called it "the greatest risk we face as a civilization". Think about it: Have you ever seen a movie where the machines start thinking for themselves that ends well? Every time I went out to Silicon Valley during the campaign, I came home more alarmed about this. My staff lived in fear that I’d start talking about "the rise of the robots" in some Iowa town hall. Maybe I should have. In any case, policy makers need to keep up with technology as it races ahead, instead of always playing catch-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clinton|first1=Hillary|title=[[What Happened (Clinton book)|What Happened]]|date=2017|isbn=978-1-5011-7556-5|page=241}} via [http://lukemuehlhauser.com/hillary-clinton-on-ai-risk/]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many of the scholars who are concerned about existential risk believe that the best way forward would be to conduct (possibly massive) research into solving the difficult "control problem" to answer the question: what types of safeguards, algorithms, or architectures can programmers implement to maximize the probability that their recursively-improving AI would continue to behave in a friendly, rather than destructive, manner after it reaches superintelligence?&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;ref name="physica_scripta" /&gt;&lt;!-- in physica_scripta, see sections 3.3.2. Encourage Research into Safe AGI, and 3.3.3. Differential Technological Progress --&gt;

A 2017 email survey of researchers with publications at the 2015 [[Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems|NIPS]] and [[International Conference on Machine Learning|ICML]] machine learning conferences asked them to evaluate Russell's concerns about AI risk. 5% said it was "among the most important problems in the field," 34% said it was "an important problem", 31% said it was "moderately important", whilst 19% said it was "not important" and 11% said it was "not a real problem" at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Grace|first1=Katja|last2=Salvatier|first2=John|last3=Dafoe|first3=Allan|last4=Zhang|first4=Baobao|last5=Evans|first5=Owain|title=When Will AI Exceed Human Performance?

=== Endorsement ===
[[File:Bill Gates June 2015.jpg|thumb|right|Bill Gates has stated "I don't understand why some people are not concerned."&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;]]
{{Further|Existential risk}}
The thesis that AI poses an existential risk, and that this risk is in need of much more attention than it currently commands, has been endorsed by many figures; perhaps the most famous are [[Elon Musk]], [[Bill Gates]], and [[Stephen Hawking]]. The most notable AI researcher to endorse the thesis is [[Stuart J. Russell]]. Endorsers sometimes express bafflement at skeptics: Gates states he "can't understand why some people are not concerned",&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hawking criticized widespread indifference in his 2014 editorial: {{cquote|'So, facing possible futures of incalculable benefits and risks, the experts are surely doing everything possible to ensure the best outcome, right? Wrong. If a superior alien civilisation sent us a message saying, 'We'll arrive in a few decades,' would we just reply, 'OK, call us when you get here{{endash}}we'll leave the lights on?' Probably not{{endash}}but this is more or less what is happening with AI.'&lt;ref name="hawking editorial"/&gt;}}

=== Skepticism ===
{{Further|Artificial general intelligence#Feasibility}}
The thesis that AI can pose existential risk also has many strong detractors. Skeptics sometimes charge that the thesis is crypto-religious, with an irrational belief in the possibility of superintelligence replacing an irrational belief in an omnipotent God; at an extreme, [[Jaron Lanier]] argues that the whole concept that current machines are in any way intelligent is "an illusion" and a "stupendous con" by the wealthy.&lt;ref name="atlantic-but-what"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/but-what-does-the-end-of-humanity-mean-for-me/361931/ |title=But What Would the End of Humanity Mean for Me? |publisher=The Atlantic | date = 9 May 2014 | accessdate =12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of existing criticism argues that AGI is unlikely in the short term: computer scientist [[Gordon Bell]] argues that the human race will already destroy itself before it reaches the technological singularity. [[Gordon Moore]], the original proponent of [[Moore's Law]], declares that "I am a skeptic. I don't believe (a technological singularity) is likely to happen, at least for a long time. And I don't know why I feel that way." [[Baidu]] Vice President [[Andrew Ng]] states AI existential risk is "like worrying about overpopulation on Mars when we have not even set foot on the planet yet."&lt;ref name=shermer&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shermer|first1=Michael|title=Apocalypse AI|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/artificial-intelligence-is-not-a-threat-mdash-yet/|accessdate=27 November 2017|work=Scientific American|date=1 March 2017|pages=77–77|language=en|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0317-77|bibcode=2017SciAm.316c..77S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some AI and AGI researchers may be reluctant to discuss risks, worrying that policymakers do not have sophisticated knowledge of the field and are prone to be convinced by "alarmist" messages, or worrying that such messages will lead to cuts in AI funding. ''Slate'' notes that some researchers are dependent on grants from government agencies such as [[DARPA]].&lt;ref name=slate_killer /&gt;

In a [[YouGov]] poll of the public for the [[British Science Association]], about a third of survey respondents said AI will pose a threat to the long term survival of humanity.&lt;ref name="bsa poll"&gt;{{cite news|title=Over a third of people think AI poses a threat to humanity|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/over-a-third-of-people-think-ai-poses-a-threat-to-humanity-2016-3?r=UK&amp;IR=T|accessdate=16 May 2016|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referencing a poll of its readers, Slate's Jacob Brogan stated that "most of the (readers filling out our online survey) were unconvinced that A.I. itself presents a direct threat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brogan|first1=Jacob|title=What Slate Readers Think About Killer A.I.|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2016/05/06/futurography_readers_share_their_opinions_about_killer_artificial_intelligence.html|accessdate=15 May 2016|work=Slate|date=6 May 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a [[SurveyMonkey]] poll of the public by [[USA Today]] found 68% thought the real current threat remains "human intelligence"; however, the poll also found that 43% said superintelligent AI, if it were to happen, would result in "more harm than good", and 38% said it would do "equal amounts of harm and good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elon Musk says AI could doom human civilization.

At some point in an intelligence explosion driven by a single AI, the AI would have to become vastly better at software innovation than the best innovators of the rest of the world; economist [[Robin Hanson]] is skeptical that this is possible.&lt;ref&gt;http://intelligence.org/files/AIFoomDebate.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/07/30855.html|title=Overcoming Bias : I Still Don’t Get Foom|website=www.overcomingbias.com|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/07/debating-yudkowsky.html|title=Overcoming Bias : Debating Yudkowsky|website=www.overcomingbias.com|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.overcomingbias.com/2017/08/foom-justifies-ai-risk-efforts-now.html|title=Overcoming Bias : Foom Justifies AI Risk Efforts Now|website=www.overcomingbias.com|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/06/the-betterness-explosion.html|title=Overcoming Bias : The Betterness Explosion|website=www.overcomingbias.com|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indifference ===
In [[The Atlantic (magazine)|The Atlantic]], James Hamblin points out that most people don't care one way or the other, and characterizes his own gut reaction to the topic as: "Get out of here. I have a hundred thousand things I am concerned about at this exact moment. Do I seriously need to add to that a technological singularity?"&lt;ref name="atlantic-but-what" /&gt; In a 2015 [[Wall Street Journal]] panel discussion devoted to AI risks, [[IBM]]'s Vice-President of Cognitive Computing, Guruduth S. Banavar, brushed off discussion of AGI with the phrase, "it is anybody's speculation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenwald|first1=Ted|title=Does Artificial Intelligence Pose a Threat?|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/does-artificial-intelligence-pose-a-threat-1431109025|accessdate=15 May 2016|work=Wall Street Journal|date=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Hinton]], the "godfather of deep learning", noted that "there is not a good track record of less intelligent things controlling things of greater intelligence", but stated that he continues his research because "the prospect of discovery is too ''sweet''".&lt;ref name=slate_killer /&gt;&lt;ref name="new yorker doomsday" /&gt;

== Consensus against regulation ==
There is nearly universal agreement that attempting to ban research into artificial intelligence would be unwise, and probably futile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=John McGinnis|author-link=John McGinnis|title=Accelerating AI|journal=[[Northwestern University Law Review]]|date=Summer 2010|volume=104|issue=3|pages=1253–1270|accessdate=16 July 2014|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&amp;context=nulr_online|quote=For all these reasons, verifying a global relinquishment treaty, or even one limited to AI-related weapons development, is a nonstarter...

Almost all of the scholars who believe existential risk exists, agree with the skeptics that banning research would be unwise: in addition to the usual problem with technology bans (that organizations and individuals can offshore their research to evade a country's regulation, or can attempt to conduct covert research), regulating research of artificial intelligence would pose an insurmountable 'dual-use' problem: while nuclear weapons development requires substantial infrastructure and resources, artificial intelligence research can be done in a garage.&lt;ref name="mcginnis"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=John McGinnis|author-link=John McGinnis|title=Accelerating AI|journal=[[Northwestern University Law Review]]|date=Summer 2010|volume=104|issue=3|pages=1253–1270|accessdate=16 July 2014|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&amp;context=nulr_online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why We Should Think About the Threat of Artificial Intelligence|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/why-we-should-think-about-the-threat-of-artificial-intelligence|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=4 October 2013|quote=Of course, one could try to ban super-intelligent computers altogether.

transparency of algorithms, possibly in combination with some form of warranty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681318301393 Kaplan Andreas; Michael Haenlein (2018) Siri, Siri in my Hand, who's the Fairest in the Land?

One rare dissenting voice calling for some sort of regulation on artificial intelligence is Elon Musk. According to [[National Public Radio|NPR]], the [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] CEO is "clearly not thrilled" to be advocating for government scrutiny that could impact his own industry, but believes the risks of going completely without oversight are too high: "Normally the way regulations are set up is when a bunch of bad things happen, there's a public outcry, and after many years a regulatory agency is set up to regulate that industry. It takes forever. That, in the past, has been bad but not something which represented a fundamental risk to the existence of civilisation." Musk states the first step would be for the government to gain "insight" into the actual status of current research, warning that "Once there is awareness, people will be extremely afraid... As they should be." In response, politicians express skepticism about the wisdom of regulating a technology that's still in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elon Musk Warns Governors: Artificial Intelligence Poses 'Existential Risk'|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/17/537686649/elon-musk-warns-governors-artificial-intelligence-poses-existential-risk|accessdate=27 November 2017|work=NPR.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gibbs|first1=Samuel|title=Elon Musk: regulate AI to combat 'existential threat' before it's too late|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/17/elon-musk-regulation-ai-combat-existential-threat-tesla-spacex-ceo|accessdate=27 November 2017|work=The Guardian|date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnbc&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kharpal|first1=Arjun|title=A.I. is in its 'infancy' and it's too early to regulate it, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich says|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/07/ai-infancy-and-too-early-to-regulate-intel-ceo-brian-krzanich-says.html|accessdate=27 November 2017|work=CNBC|date=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding both to Musk and to February 2017 proposals by European Union lawmakers to regulate AI and robotics, Intel CEO [[Brian Krzanich]] argues that artificial intelligence is in its infancy and that it's too early to regulate the technology.&lt;ref name=cnbc/&gt;

'''''Flatliners''''' is a 2017 American [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[psychological horror]] film directed by [[Niels Arden Oplev]] and written by [[Ben Ripley]]. The film is a remake of the [[Flatliners|1990 film of the same name]], and stars [[Ellen Page]], [[Diego Luna]], [[Nina Dobrev]], [[James Norton (actor)|James Norton]] and [[Kiersey Clemons]]. It follows five medical students who attempt to conduct experiments that produce [[near-death experience]]s. 

[[Sony Pictures]] released the film in the United States on September 29, 2017. It received generally negative reviews from critics, with many comparing it unfavorably to the original, but it was a moderate box office success, grossing $45 million worldwide on a $19 million budget.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- 400 to 700 words only in this section. --&gt;
A medical student, Courtney ([[Ellen Page]]), is obsessed with the idea of the afterlife, wanting to find out what happens after death. She invites fellow students Jamie ([[James Norton (actor)|James Norton]]) and Sophia ([[Kiersey Clemons]]) to join her in an experiment, in an unused hospital room: using defibrillation to stop her heart for sixty seconds whilst recording her brain, and then reviving her. She assures them they would not be held responsible for any accidents. Sophia is against this, but Jamie does it anyway. After sixty seconds, they panic as they are unable to revive her, but eventually manage to with the help of fellow student Ray ([[Diego Luna]]). Later, Marlo ([[Nina Dobrev]]), a rival of Ray, arrives and learns of the experiment.

Initially Courtney begins to recall memories of past events such as her grandmother's recipe for bread. Courtney experiences increased intelligence and euphoria, being suddenly able to play the piano after 12 years and answer questions in class perfectly. Envious, Jamie flatlines, but has a disturbing near death experience as he meets his ex-girlfriend. Marlo and Sophia follow suit and flatline, for an increasing number of minutes. During Sophia’s turn they are nearly caught and flee the hospital and arrive at a party. Courtney and Jamie start seeing visions of past mistakes, but do not tell the others.

It soon turns into a living horror as those who flatlined find themselves haunted by their visions: Courtney is haunted by her dead sister Tessa from a car crash she caused because she was using her phone. Jamie is haunted by the baby of his ex-girlfriend whom he got pregnant and begged to get an abortion. Marlo is haunted by a man named Cyrus (who was stung by jellyfish) whom she killed when she accidentally mixed up his medication, and Sophia is haunted by a girl named Irina whose life she ruined out of jealousy by hacking her phone and sending out her nudes. This allowed Sophia to become [[valedictorian]]. They realize there is a downside to flatlining.

The hauntings get more and more intense. Courtney, traumatised by her visions, records a message apologising for the consequences and admitting that her interest in flatlining was due to the death of her sister, not for scientific discovery. Shortly after, she is chased by visions of her dead sister and falls to her death from the fire escape of her apartment building after her sister's ghost appears in front of her and pushes her off. The others are devastated when they learn of Courtney’s death and then panic when they realize they may be implicated if anyone discovers their experiments. After attempting to remove all notes and evidence from Courtney’s apartment, Marlo is sent to the morgue to find Courtney’s phone. She is once again haunted by visions. Meanwhile, on his boat, Jaime again hears the cries of a baby and a woman weeping. He falls out of his boat and swims to the dock where a figure stabs him in his hand. 

The group watches Courtney's recording and find out that she had encountered similar hauntings. They come clean to the mistakes that they made and soon come to the conclusion that the hauntings they're experiencing are their hallucinations because of guilt from their past sins, not paranormal beings. Ray, the only one who didn't flatline, initially disbelieves what's happening. 

The group takes action to stop the hallucinations by fixing their past mistakes. Sophia visits Irina to apologize, which Irina accepts. Jamie visits his ex-girlfriend and discovers she didn't get an abortion, but kept the baby; he apologizes and promises to provide for his son. Later, Ray and Marlo get into a fight when Ray finds out Marlo covered up the real reason Cyrus died and she refuses to come clean. Marlo is suffocated while driving and crashes her car. Tired of being haunted by her hallucinations, Marlo flatlines on her own in the hope of asking forgiveness of the patient that died due to her mistake. Ray, Sophia, and Jamie rush to stop her and are successful in resuscitating Marlo after she sees an apparition of Courtney who tells Marlo that she needs to forgive herself. In the end, Marlo, Ray, Sophia, and Jamie reminisce about Courtney and celebrate their friendships in the little restaurant they hang out at, where there is a performance of the piano piece that Courtney played. The movie ends with Jamie proposing a toast, honoring Courtney.

The '''Francevillian biota''' (also known as '''Gabon macrofossils''' or '''Gabonionta''') is a group of 2.1-billion-year-old [[Palaeoproterozoic]], macroscopic organisms known from fossils found in [[Gabon]] in the Palaeoproterozoic [[Francevillian B Formation]], a  black shale province. The fossils are regarded as evidence of the earliest form of [[multicellular life]].&lt;ref name="El Albani et al 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=El Albani|first1=Abderrazak|last2=Bengtson|first2=Stefan|last3=Canfield|first3=Donald E.|last4=Riboulleau|first4=Armelle|last5=Rollion Bard|first5=Claire|last6=Macchiarelli|first6=Roberto|display-authors=etal|title=The 2.1 Ga Old Francevillian Biota: Biogenicity, Taphonomy and Biodiversity|journal=PLoS ONE|year= 2014|volume=9|issue=6|pages=e99438|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0099438|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0099438|bibcode = 2014PLoSO...999438E|pmid=24963687|pmc=4070892}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fossils were discovered by an international team led by the Moroccan-French geologist [[Abderrazak El Albani]], of the [[University of Poitiers]], France. While the fossils have yet to be assigned to a formal taxonomic position, they have been informally and collectively referred to as the "Gabonionta" by the [[Natural History Museum Vienna]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm-wien.ac.at/jart/prj3/nhm/data/uploads/Pressemappe_Gabun_English.pdf Experiment Life – the Gabonionta]. (Press Release). 4 March 2014. Naturhistorisches Museum Wien&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology==
[[File:Gabonionta II.jpg|thumb|A member of the Francevillian biota. Maximum fossil diameter= 12 cm]]
The fossil organisms are up to 17&amp;nbsp;cm in size.&lt;ref name="Albani2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Une vie complexe il y a 2 milliards d’années : l’hypothèse se confirme !|url=http://www.futura-sciences.com/magazines/terre/infos/actu/d/paleontologie-vie-complexe-il-y-2-milliards-annees-hypothese-confirme-54231/|website=futura-sciences.com|language=fr|date=26 June 2014|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their bodies were flattened disks with a characteristic morphology, including circular and elongated individuals. A spherical to ellipsoidal central body is bounded by radial structures. The fossils show three-dimensionality and coordinated growth.&lt;ref name="Albani2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last= El Albani|first=Abderrazak|author2=Bengtson, Stefan |author3=Canfield, Donald E. |author4=Bekker, Andrey |author5=Macchiarelli, Roberto |author6=Mazurier, Arnaud |author7=Hammarlund, Emma U. |display-authors= etal |title=Large colonial organisms with coordinated growth in oxygenated environments 2.1 Gyr ago|journal=Nature|year=2010|volume=466|issue=7302|pages=100–104|doi=10.1038/nature09166|pmid=20596019|url=http://www.afrikibouge.com/publications/Article%20Albani.pdf|bibcode=2010Natur.466..100A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell-cell communication must be assumed as it existed before multi-cellularity arose.&lt;ref name="Sébe-Pedrós"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sebe-Pedros|first=A.|author2=Roger, A.

A newer 2014 study by El Albani et al. describes multiple types of fossils with different morphologies. There are convoluted tubes, and "string of pearls"-like structures that terminate in a "flower". This is similar to [[dictyostelid]]s, amoebal organisms that form multicellular assemblies to migrate. However, dictyostelids are terrestrial, not marine organisms so the structures cannot  simply be dictyostelids. Among known fossils, the Ediacaran [[Nemiana]] and [[Beltanelloides]] are most similar.&lt;ref name="El Albani et al 2014"/&gt;

==Locality==
[[File:Francevillian basin geology.png|thumb|Geology of the Francevillian basin]]
The findings come from shales of the Franceville basin with a high fossil density of up to 40 individuals per square meter. Presumably, the organisms survived at the bottom in shallow sea water in colonies.The [[geochemistry]] of the fossil site indicates that they lived on the sediment under an oxygenated water column of a [[Progradation|prograding]] delta, and they might have engaged in [[aerobic respiration]].&lt;ref name="Albani2010"/&gt;

==Interpretations==
In describing the fossils, El Albani and colleagues described them as colonial organisms with possible affinities to eukaryotes, akin to [[microbial mat]]s albeit unlike any known structures in the fossil record, yet noting the complexity of the fossils and presence of [[sterane]] as suggestive of possible [[eukaryote]] identity. In a concurrent news report in ''[[Nature (magazine)|Nature]]'', paleontologist [[Philip Donoghue]] of Bristol University advocates a more conservative approach pending further evidence before calling them eukaryotes. Another view, held by [[Yale University|Yale's]] [[Adolf Seilacher]], interprets the fossils as not organisms at all, but rather [[pseudofossils]] of inorganic [[pyrites]].&lt;ref name=Maxmen2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maxmen|first1=Amy|title=Ancient macrofossils unearthed in West Africa|journal=Nature|date=30 June 2010|doi=10.1038/news.2010.323|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100630/full/news.2010.323.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Albani et al. (2014) explicitly disputes Seilacher's interpretation. Both pyritized and unpyritized impressions of the structures remain, as well as lightly pyritized forms. The structures have formed in a single event, at the same time as the sediment. This is demonstrated by the uniform distribution of sulfur isotope ratios within the sample. In pyrite flowers, which crystallize slowly, the isotope ratio would vary within the structure. For structures that resemble pollen, chemical analysis also shows that the material in the walls of the "pollen" contains organic material.&lt;ref name="El Albani et al 2014" /&gt;

== Fate ==
The Francevillian biota disappears and is absent in the overlying black shale. El Albani attributes this to their extinction. The biota formed with the Lomagundi event, a temporary increase in atmospheric oxygen, and became extinct from marine anoxia when the event ended. The biota represents the first known experiment in multicellularity, with no extant multicellular descendants.&lt;ref name="El Albani et al 2014" /&gt;

'''Grand Duchess Alexandra Nikolaevna of [[Russian Empire|Russia]]''' (24 June 1825 – 10 August 1844) was the youngest daughter and fourth child of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]], [[Emperor of Russia]], and his wife, Princess [[Charlotte of Prussia]]. She was a younger sister of [[Tsar Alexander II of Russia]].

==Biography==
She was the [[namesake]] of her paternal aunt, [[Alexandra Pavlovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna]], who died in childbirth along with her stillborn daughter in 1801, but in the family she was known by her affectionate nickname, "Adini". According to her sister [[Queen Olga of Württemberg|Olga]]'s memoirs, Alexandra had inherited her mother's "Prussian look". It was also said that she resembled her late maternal grandmother, [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Louise of Prussia]]. Nicholas affectionately spoke of Adini as "... a little moppet, but very sweet".
[[File: 'Grand-Duchesses Olga and Alexandra, Daughters of Nicholas I' by Christina Robertson, 1840.JPG|thumb|left| Adini (right) with her older sister, Grand Duchess Olga.]]
[[File:Gau-portret-aleksandry-n.jpg|thumb|left|Alexandra at age 15, four years before her marriage]]
Alexandra was famous in [[Saint Petersburg]] society for both her wit and her lively personality. She was also the musician in the family.  A serious student of vocal music, she was talented enough to qualify for lessons from the famous soprano [[Henriette Sontag]].

===Marriage===
[[File: Alexandra Nikolaievna of Russia by C.Robertson (1840, Hermitage).jpg|thumb|right|Alexandra Nikolaevna by [[Christina Robertson]], Hermitage Museum]]

On 28 January 1844, Alexandra married Prince [[Frederick William of Hesse]] (1820–1884) in St. Petersburg. Her husband was the only son of [[Prince William of Hesse]] and [[Princess Louise Charlotte of Denmark]]. "Fritz", as he was called, had come to St. Petersburg as a prospective bridegroom for [[Queen Olga of Württemberg|Olga]], but fell in love with Adini instead on the first evening he spent with the family. Although Olga was the elder daughter and also found Fritz to be an engaging young man, she graciously stepped aside in favour of her sister, and even chaperoned the couple when they wanted to spend time together away from the prying eyes of the court. The emperor and empress then gave their permission for Alexandra and Fritz to be married.

Alexandra became acutely ill with [[tuberculosis]] shortly before her wedding, and this complicated the pregnancy which soon followed. She was never well enough to travel to [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse]] and take up her new position with her husband. They stayed in St. Petersburg, where her health rapidly declined.

She went into labor prematurely, three months before the child was due, and gave birth to a son, Wilhelm. The infant died shortly after he was born, and Alexandra died later the same day. Her parents were devastated and their grief would last until the end of their lives. She was buried  at the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] in St. Petersburg. Her son was buried in Rumpenheim (Germany).

Nine years later, Fritz married Adini's first cousin, [[Princess Anna of Prussia]] (1836–1918), as his second wife.  Eventually he became head of the [[House of Hesse-Kassel]].  Although they had six children together, Fritz and Anna were never emotionally close, and it is speculated that one reason was because Fritz was unable to overcome his grief for his first wife.

==Legacy==
In the gardens of the [[Petergof]] palace near Saint Petersburg there is a [[memorial bench]] with a small sculpture bust of the Grand Duchess.  Her rooms there have been preserved just as they were at the time of her death.

Six sheaves of wheat made of diamonds, which came to Hesse on one of the gowns in Alexandra's trousseau, were transformed into a tiara by Anna around 1900.  This tiara is now the traditional wedding tiara of the Hessian princely family, and was last worn by Floria of Faber-Castell when in 2003, she married [[Donatus, Hereditary Prince of Hesse]], Adini's husband's great-great grandson by his second marriage.

'''INS ''Dakar''''' ({{lang-he|אח"י דקר}}) was a [[Diesel–electric transmission|diesel–electric]] [[submarine]] in the [[Israeli Navy]]. The vessel, which was a modified [[World War II]]  [[British T-class submarine]], had previously been {{HMS|Totem|P352|6}} of the [[Royal Navy]]. She had been purchased by [[Israel]] from the [[Government of the United Kingdom]] as part of a three T-class submarine deal in 1965. However, ''Dakar'' and her entire 69-man crew were lost en route to Israel on 25 January 1968. Despite extensive searches over the course of three decades, its wreckage was not found until 1999, when it was located between the islands of [[Cyprus]] and [[Crete]] at a depth of approximately {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on}}. The submarine's [[conning tower]] was salvaged and is on display outside [[Clandestine Immigration and Naval Museum]] in [[Haifa]]. The exact cause of ''Dakar''{{'}}s sinking remains unknown. It was one of four submarine disappearances in 1968; the others were those of the {{ship|French submarine|Minerve|S647|6}}, the {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-129|1960|6}} and the U.S. submarine {{USS|Scorpion|SSN-589|6}}.

== Early career ==
{{main|HMS Totem (P352)}}
HMS ''Totem'' was built as a [[British T-class submarine#Group Three boats|group 3]] variant of the [[British T-class submarine]] that was constructed during World War II at [[HMNB Devonport|HM Dockyard Devonport]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 28 September 1943 and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] in early 1945. After the [[End of World War II in Europe|end of World War II]], ''Totem'', along with the other surviving group 3 boats, was equipped with [[submarine snorkel]]s to allow for longer periods of operation underwater. Between 1951 and 1953, ''Totem'' was one of eight British Navy submarines to be converted to the "Super T" design which allowed the vessel to travel at higher and quieter underwater speeds.

== Purchase by Israel ==
In 1965, ''Totem'' was purchased by Israel, along with two of her T-class [[sister boat]]s, {{HMS|Truncheon|P353|2}} and {{HMS|Turpin|P354|2}}. The former ''Totem'' was commissioned into the [[Israeli Navy]] at [[Portsmouth, England]] on 10 November 1967 as INS ''Dakar'' (דקר, {{lang-en|Swordfish}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first =David W. | last = Jourdan|title=Never Forgotten: The Search for, and Discovery of, Israel's Lost Submarine Dakar |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HUmvPAAACAAJ |year= 2009 |publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn= 978-1-59114-418-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the command of Major Ya'acov Ra'anan. She then headed to Scotland to conduct sea and dive [[Sea trial|trials]]. Late in 1967, ''Dakar'' returned to Portsmouth before leaving for Israel on 9 January 1968.

''Dakar''{{'}}s first port call after leaving the UK was [[Gibraltar]] on the morning of 15 January. She departed at midnight on 16 January with the intention of crossing the [[Mediterranean Sea]] on snorkel. The original schedule was for the submarine to enter her new home base at [[Haifa]] on 2 February. During her voyage, she was making excellent speed (averaging over {{convert|8|kn|abbr=on}}), and Major Ra'anan radioed Haifa to request entering port ahead of schedule. He was ordered to enter on 29 January. Later, Ra'anan requested to enter a day earlier on Sunday. This request was denied, as the welcoming ceremony could not be rescheduled.

==Loss==
At 06:10 on 24 January 1968 ''Dakar'' transmitted her position, 34.16°N 26.26°E, just east of [[Crete]]. Over the next 18 hours she sent three control transmissions which did not include her position. Her final broadcast was at 00:02 25 January, after which no further transmissions were received.

On 26 January the British [[Admiralty]] reported the submarine was missing and gave the last known position as {{convert|100|mi|km}} west of Cyprus. An international [[search and rescue]] operation began, including units from Israel, the United States, Greece, Turkey, Britain and Lebanon. Although the Israeli Navy in Haifa began broadcasting calls to commercial vessels to be on the look out for ''Dakar'', Israeli officials would not admit the submarine was missing. On 27 January, a radio station in [[Nicosia]], Cyprus, received a distress call on the frequency of ''Dakar''{{'}}s emergency buoy, apparently from south-east of Cyprus, but no further traces of the submarine were found. On 31 January, all non-Israeli forces abandoned their search at sunset. Israeli forces continued the search for another four days, ceasing at sundown on 4 February 1968.

Israel denied that ''Dakar'' sank as the result of hostile action and stated that ''Dakar'' was involved in [[Crash dive|crash diving]] exercises on its return voyage and was lost probably as a result of a mechanical failure. On 25 April 1968, Vice Admiral [[Abraham Botzer]],  commander of the [[Israeli Navy]], stated that ''Dakar'' sank on 24 January 1968, two days before being reported missing due to "technical or human malfunctioning" and not "foul play".

==Searches and discovery==
[[File:HN-Dakar-buoy-2.jpg|right|thumb|''Dakar''{{'}}s emergency buoy in the [[Clandestine Immigration and Naval Museum]] in Haifa.]]
[[File:HN-INS-Dakar-2.jpg|right|thumb|The salvaged [[conning tower]] from ''Dakar'' outside Haifa's Naval Museum.]]
On 9 February 1969, over a year after ''Dakar'' went missing, a fisherman found her stern [[Rescue buoy (submarine)|emergency buoy]] marker washed up on the coast of [[Khan Yunis]], a town southwest of [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. British T-class submarines had two such buoy markers, bow and stern, secured behind wooden doors in cages under the deck and attached to the submarine with metal cables {{convert|200|m|ft|sp=us}} long. However, the experts who examined the {{convert|65|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} of cable still attached to the buoy made several inaccurate determinations. Their conclusions, that the buoy had remained attached to the submarine for most of the preceding year until the cable broke completely, ''Dakar'' rested in depth between {{convert|150|and|326|m|ft|sp=us|0}}, and was {{convert|50|-|70|nmi|km|abbr=on}} off her planned route, misled searchers for decades. It was not until April 1999 and some 25 failed expeditions later that a search effort was concentrated along the original route.

On 1 January 1970, the Egyptian newspaper ''[[Al Akhbar (Egypt)|Al Akhbar]]'' reported that ''Dakar'' had been sunk by an Egyptian warship with [[depth charge]]s. The Egyptian story was told in a 2 July 2005 interview by ''[[Asharq Al-Awsat]]'' with General Mohamed Azab (major at that time):

:On 23 January 1968, the Egyptian frigate, ''Assyout'', left Alexandria base in a training mission for the naval academy. After completing the training assignment and during the return journey to the base, students noticed the periscope of an alien submarine in Egyptian waters, about two miles (3 km) off Alexandria. The Egyptian commander was informed and the decision was taken to attack the unknown submarine. However, the submarine made a hasty dive and the Egyptian ship lost track of it. General Azab reported the story to his commanders and mentioned that there is a probability that the submarine had crashed into the seabed. However, the story was not believed by the higher Egyptian commanders and there was not sufficient evidence to start a search process. General Azab mentioned that the submarine may have crashed into the seabed due to the shallow depth of water in that region, about 36 meters, while it needed at least 40 meters to dive. It appears that the submarine commander took the risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aawsat.com/details.asp?section=4&amp;issueno=9713&amp;article=309359&amp;feature= معلومات جديدة قد تفك لغز الغواصة الإسرائيلية «داكار» التي غرقت أمام ساحل الإسكندرية عام 1968] (translated herein from Arabic with minor editing)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli government stated there was no evidence to substantiate the Egyptian unofficial charges.

During the 1980s the Israelis, using a salvage vessel with Egyptian liaison officers, conducted three searches for ''Dakar'' in waters north of Sinai and another search off the Greek island of [[Rhodes]]. In August 1986, the U.S. Navy committed a [[P-3 Orion]] and a [[S-3 Viking]] to search Egyptian waters near [[al-Arish]]. In October 1998, Israel began running advertisements in newspapers in  Turkey, Egypt, France, Greece and Russia offering rewards of up to $300,000 for any information on the fate of ''Dakar''.

On 24 May 1999 a joint U.S.–Israeli search team using information received from U.S. intelligence sources and led by Thomas Kent Dettweiler, a subcontractor from  American Nauticos Corporation, detected a large body on the seabed between [[Crete]] and Cyprus, at a depth of some {{convert|3,000|m|ft|sp=us|0}}. On 28 May the first video pictures were taken by the remote operated vehicle ''Remora II'', making it clear that ''Dakar'' had been found.  She rests on her keel, bow to the northwest. Her conning tower was snapped off and fallen over the side. The stern of the submarine, with the propellers and dive planes, broke off aft of the engine room and rests beside the main hull.

During October 2000 a survey of the ''Dakar'' wreckage and the wreckage site was undertaken by Nauticos corporation and the Israeli Navy. Some artifacts were recovered, including the submarine's bridge, the boat's [[gyrocompass]] and many small items.

The exact cause of the loss is unknown, but it appears that no emergency measures had been taken before ''Dakar'' dived rapidly through her maximum depth, suffered a catastrophic hull rupture, and continued her plunge to the bottom.  The emergency buoy was released by the violence of the hull collapse, and drifted for a year before washing ashore.

==Later developments==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 12292 dakar submarine memorial in mount herzl.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial for INS ''Dakar'']]
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 28342 Dakar Park In Givat Shmuel.JPG|thumb|right|Dakar Park in [[Giv'at Shmuel]]]]
A memorial designed by architect David Brutzkus was dedicated in 1971 at the National Military and Police cemetery in [[Mount Herzl]] in [[Jerusalem]]. It is inscribed with a Hebrew Bible verse from Psalm 77:19: "Your path led through the sea, your way through the mighty waters, though Your footprints were not seen."

''Dakar''{{'}}s bridge and forward edge of her sail are now a memorial display in the Naval Museum in [[Haifa]].

The recovery of any still-existing remains of the crew members has been considered. This would permit their Jewish burial in Israel as Judaism does not recognize [[Burial at sea#Judaism|burial at sea]] and requires burial in earth. To date crew members' families have held a ceremony in a ship over the submarine's remnants. The [[Rabbinical]] authorities had to solve complicated problems of [[Halakha|Jewish law]] before the crew members' wives could be declared officially widows, so that they could remarry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jta.org/1981/03/02/archive/all-crew-members-of-submarine-dakar-officially-declared-dead-chief-rabbi-says-wives-of-crew-members&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a film was released, entitled ''[[Full Circle (movie)|Full Circle]]'', a documentary about the search for the wreckage. In May 2009, a book was published by Nauticos president [[David W. Jourdan]] entitled, ''Never Forgotten: The Search and Discovery of Israel's Lost Submarine Dakar''. This book chronicles the history of the submarine, the story of the families of the 69 lost sailors, and the events leading to the discovery in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David W. Jourdan|title=Never Forgotten: The Search for &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; and Discovery of Israel's Lost Submarine Dakar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HUmvPAAACAAJ|year=2009|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-1-59114-418-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 2015 it was reported that the previously-classified reports on the loss of ''Dakar'' and the subsequent search were released to the families of the submarine's crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Families of Israeli submarine crew receive declassified reports on ’68 sinking|url=http://www.jta.org/2015/09/01/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/families-of-israeli-submarine-crew-receive-declassified-reports-on-68-sinking|accessdate=2 September 2015|agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* ''[[Bright Shark]]'' is a novel written by [[Robert Ballard]] and Tony Chiu and describes the recent discovery of INS ''Dakar'' by an American research vessel. Israel and the USSR join forces to preserve the submarine's secret – at the price of direct confrontation with the U.S.

[[File:Immunofluorescence.jpg|thumb|These figures demonstrates the basic mechanism of immunofluorescence. Primary immunofluorescence is depicted on the left, which shows an antibody with a fluorophore group bound to it directly binding to the epitope of the antigen for which it is specific. Once the antibody binds to the epitope, the sample can be viewed under fluorescent microscope to confirm the presence of the antigen in the sample. Conversely, secondary immunofluorescence is depicted to the right, which shows that first an untagged primary antibody binds to the epitope of the antigen in a mechanism similar to the one described above. However, after the primary antibodies have bound to their target, a secondary antibody (tagged with a fluorophore) comes along. This secondary antibody’s binding sites are specific for the primary antibody that’s already bound to the antigen, and therefore the secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody. This method allows for more fluorophore-tagged antibodies to attach to their target, thus increasing the fluorescent signal during microscopy.]]
'''Immunofluorescence''' is a technique used for [[optical microscope|light]] [[microscopy]] with a [[fluorescence microscope]] and is used primarily on [[microbiological]] samples.

The skin is from a patient with systemic [[lupus erythematosus]] and shows IgG deposit at two different places: The first is a band-like deposit along the epidermal [[basement membrane]] ("lupus band test" is positive). The second is within the nuclei of the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] cells (anti-nuclear antibodies).]]

=== Preparation of fluorescence ===
To make fluorochrome-labeled antibodies, a fluorochrome must be conjugated ("tagged") to the antibody. Likewise, an antigen can also be conjugated to the antibody with a fluorescent probe in a technique called fluorescent antigen technique. Staining procedures can apply to both fixed antigen in the cytoplasm or to cell surface antigens on live cells, called "membrane immunofluorescence". It is also possible to label the complement of the antibody-antigen complex with a fluorescent probe.  In addition to the element to which fluorescence probes are attached, there are two general classes of immunofluorescence techniques: primary and secondary. The following descriptions will focus primarily on these classes in terms of conjugated antibodies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are two classes of immunofluorescence techniques, primary (or direct) and secondary (or indirect).

===Primary (direct)===
Primary (direct) immunofluorescence uses a single, primary antibody, chemically linked to a [[fluorophore]]. The primary antibody recognizes the target molecule (antigen) and binds to a specific region called the epitope. The attached fluorophore can be detected via fluorescent microscopy, which, depending on the messenger used, will emit a specific wavelength of light once excited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.dako.com/08002_03aug09_ihc_guidebook_5th_edition_chapter_10.pdf | chapter = Immunohistochemical Staining Methods | title = IHC Guidebook | edition = Sixth | date = 2013 | publisher = Dako Denmark A/S, An Agilent Technologies Company }}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct immunofluorescence, although somewhat less common, has notable advantages over the secondary (indirect) procedure. The direct attachment of the messenger to the antibody reduces the number of steps in the procedure, saving time and reducing non-specific background signal.&lt;ref name=Frit&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fritschy | first1 = Jean-Marc | last2 = Härtig | first2 = Wolfgang | name-list-format = vanc | title = Immunofluorescence | doi = 10.1038/npg.els.0001174 | url = http://www.els.net/WileyCDA/ElsArticle/refId-a0001174.html | year = 2001 | journal = ELS | isbn = 978-0-470-01590-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This also limits the possibility of antibody cross-reactivity and possible mistakes throughout the process.

However, some disadvantages do exist in this method. Since the number of fluorescent molecules that can be bound to the primary antibody is limited, direct immunofluorescence is substantially less sensitive than indirect immunofluorescence and may result in false negatives. Direct immunofluorescence also requires the use of much more primary antibody, which is extremely expensive, sometimes running up to $400.00/mL.

===Secondary (indirect)===
[[File:Blood vessels in porcine skin - SMA A488 - 20x.jpg|thumb|right|A fluorescent stain for [[actin]] in the [[smooth muscle]] of the skin.]]
Secondary (indirect) immunofluorescence uses two antibodies; the unlabeled first  (primary) antibody specifically binds the target molecule, and the secondary antibody, which carries the fluorophore, recognizes the primary antibody and binds to it.  Multiple secondary antibodies can bind a single primary antibody.  This provides signal amplification by increasing the number of fluorophore molecules per antigen.&lt;ref name=Frit/&gt; This protocol is more complex and time-consuming than the primary (or direct) protocol above, but allows more flexibility because a variety of different secondary antibodies and detection techniques can be used for a given primary antibody.&lt;ref name=Frit/&gt;

This protocol is possible because an antibody consists of two parts, a variable region (which recognizes the antigen) and constant region (which makes up the structure of the antibody molecule). It is important to realize that this division is artificial and in reality the antibody molecule is four polypeptide chains: two heavy chains and two light chains. A researcher can generate several primary antibodies that recognize various antigens (have different variable regions), but all share the same constant region. All these antibodies may therefore be recognized by a single secondary antibody. This saves the cost of modifying the primary antibodies to directly carry a fluorophore.

Different primary antibodies with different constant regions are typically generated by raising the antibody in different species. For example, a researcher might create primary antibodies in a goat that recognize several antigens, and then employ dye-coupled rabbit secondary antibodies that recognize the goat antibody constant region ("rabbit anti-goat" antibodies). The researcher may then create a second set of primary antibodies in a mouse that could be recognized by a separate "donkey anti-mouse" secondary antibody. This allows re-use of the difficult-to-make dye-coupled antibodies in multiple experiments.

==Limitations==
As with most fluorescence techniques, a significant problem with immunofluorescence is [[photobleaching]].  Loss of activity caused by photobleaching can be controlled by reducing or limiting the intensity or time-span of light exposure, by increasing the concentration of fluorophores, or by employing more robust fluorophores that are less prone to bleaching (e.g., [[Alexa Fluor]]s, Seta Fluors, or [[DyLight Fluor]]s). Some problems that may arise from this technique include autofluorescence, extraneous undesired specific fluorescence, and nonspecific fluorescence. Autofluorescence includes fluorescence emitted from the sample tissue or cell itself. Extraneous undesired specific fluorescence occurs when a targeted antigen is impure and contains antigenic contaminants. Nonspecific fluorescence involves the loss of a probe's specificity due to fluorophore, from improper fixation, or from a dried out specimen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Immunofluorescence is only limited to fixed (i.e., dead) cells when structures within the cell are to be visualized because antibodies do not penetrate the cell membrane when reacting with fluorescent labels. Antigenic material must be fixed firmly on the site of its natural localization inside the cell.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/643714056|title=Immunofluorescence in medical science : with 28 tab.|last=Akiyoshi.|first=Kawamura,|date=1983-01-01|publisher=Springer u.a|isbn=3540124837|oclc=643714056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intact antibodies can also be too large to dye cancer cells ''in vivo''.&lt;ref name="Sonn_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sonn GA, Behesnilian AS, Jiang ZK, Zettlitz KA, Lepin EJ, Bentolila LA, Knowles SM, Lawrence D, Wu AM, Reiter RE | title = Fluorescent Image-Guided Surgery with an Anti-Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA) Diabody Enables Targeted Resection of Mouse Prostate Cancer Xenografts in Real Time | journal = Clinical Cancer Research  | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 1403–12 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26490315 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-0503 | pmc=4794340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their size results in slow tumor penetration and long circulating half-life. Research has been done investigating the use of diabodies to get around this limitation.&lt;ref name="Sonn_2016" /&gt; Proteins in the supernatant or on the outside of the cell membrane can be bound by the antibodies; this allows for living cells to be stained. Depending on the fixative that is being used, proteins of interest might become cross-linked and this could result in either false positive or false negative signals due to non-specific binding.

An alternative approach is using [[recombinant protein]]s containing fluorescent protein domains, e.g., [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP). Use of such "tagged" proteins allows determination of their localization in live cells. Even though this seems to be an elegant alternative to immunofluorescence, the cells have to be transfected or transduced with the GFP-tag, and as a consequence they become at least S1 or above organisms that require stricter security standards in a laboratory. This technique involves altering the genetic information of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chalfie|first=Martin|date=1995-10-01|title=Green Fluorescent Protein|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-1097.1995.tb08712.x/abstract|journal=Photochemistry and Photobiology|language=en|volume=62|issue=4|pages=651–656|doi=10.1111/j.1751-1097.1995.tb08712.x|issn=1751-1097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advances ==
Many improvements to this method lie in the improvement of fluorescent microscopes and fluorophores. Super-resolution methods generally refer to a microscope's ability to produce resolution below the Abbe limit (a limit placed on light due to its wavelength). This diffraction limit is about 200-300&amp;nbsp;nm in the lateral direction and 500-700&amp;nbsp;nm in the axial direction. This limit is comparable or larger than some structures in the cell, and consequently, this limit prevented scientists from determining details in their structure.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.biochem.77.061906.092014|title=Super-Resolution Fluorescence Microscopy|last=Huang|first=Bo|last2=Bates|first2=Mark|date=2009-06-02|website=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.biochem.77.061906.092014|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.77.061906.092014|pmc=2835776|pmid=19489737|access-date=2017-03-24|last3=Zhuang|first3=Xiaowei}}&lt;/ref&gt; Super-resolution in fluorescence, more specifically, refers to the ability of a microscope to prevent the simultaneous fluorescence of adjacent spectrally identical fluorophores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/960719686|title=Super-resolution imaging in biomedicine|last=1959-|first=Diaspro, Alberto,|last2=van,|first2=Zandvoort, Marc A.

Clones are screened for the presence of the gene product (a protein).
This strategy requires first that a gene library is implemented in an expression vector, and that antiserum to the protein is available.
Radioactivity or an enzyme is coupled generally with the secondary
antibody.
The radioactivity/enzyme linked secondary antibody can be purchased commercially and can detect different antigens.
In commercial diagnostics labs, labelled primary antibodies are
also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Karam|first= James|date= November 26, 1990|title= Methods in Nucleic Acids Research|publisher= CRC Press|page= 309|isbn= 0849353114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Edward McCullough''' (November 2, 1832 – November 8, 1885) was an [[United States|American]] [[actor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://asp6new.alexanderstreet.com/atho/atho.detail.people.aspx?personcode=per0046273 John E. McCullough: ''North American Theatre Online'']&lt;/ref&gt;
==Biography==

John McCullough was born in [[Coleraine]], [[Ireland]]. He went to America at the age of 16, and made his first appearance on the stage at the [[Arch Street Theatre]], [[Philadelphia]], in 1857. In support of [[Edwin Forrest]] and [[Edwin Booth]] he played second roles in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]an and other tragedies, and Forrest left him by will all his prompt books. [[Virginius (play)|Virginius]] was his greatest success, although even in this part and as [[Othello]] he was coldly received in [[England]] (1881). On the night of September 29, 1884, he broke down on stage at [[McVicker's Theater]] in Chicago and was unable to recite his lines. The audience, thinking he was drunk, hissed and booed. In fact, McCullough was suffering from the early stages of [[general paresis]]. He was later committed to the [[Bloomingdale Insane Asylum]] but continued to decline and finally died in an [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]] in Philadelphia. His "insane ravings" became popular and were imitated in one of the first audio recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/edis/cylinder_desc.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702021624/http://www.nps.gov/edis/cylinder_desc.htm |archivedate=2006-07-02 |title=Edison National Historic Site |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
On March 18, 1865, less than a month before he assassinated President [[Abraham Lincoln]], John Wilkes Booth appeared at [[Ford's Theatre]], Washington,  in the play ''The Apostate'' which was performed as a [[Benefit performance#As a benefit for performers|benefit]] for John McCullough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnherald.com/2003articlefollowmoney.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200206/http://www.lincolnherald.com/2003articlefollowmoney.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |title=John Wilkes Booth: The Money Trail - by James O. Hall with Michael Maione - Lincoln Herald, Volume105, Number 1 (Spring 2003): 7-14 |publisher=LincolnHerald.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889, after his death, McCullough was memorialized with a statue in Philadelphia - to which Edwin Booth reportedly refused to contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argenweb.net/marion/newspapers/mt-echo-newspaper-1886-03-26.html |title=Mar 26, 1886 Issue Mt Echo Newspaper Marion Co AR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haunting==

An apocryphal version of his death which arose as theatre lore is reported by the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]] in [[Washington, DC]] where he appeared a number of times in various roles between 1875 and 1889 [incorrect date—he died in 1885].  According to this version of events, McCullough was murdered backstage by a fellow actor, was buried by members of the acting company in a cellar beneath the stage, and is a resident [[ghost]].

According to an episode of ''[[Celebrity Ghost Stories]]'' ("D.B. Sweeney, Adrien Zmed, Eddie Money, DJ Nicole Leone"), John Edward McCullough's ghost is responsible for breaking the ankle of [[Adrian Zmed]] during a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]''.

'''Kimimon''' is a game for the [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]]. It debuted in November 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/iphone/puzzle/kimimon/index.html |title=Kimimon for iPhone/iPod |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since released multiple updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iphoneappreview.com/kimimon-the-customizable-tamagotchi-for-iphone-and-itouch.html |title=Kimimon: the cutomizable tamagotchi for iphone and itouch |publisher=[[IPhone App Review]] |accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimimon is a [[digital pet]] game, where players raise a unique virtual pet from baby into adulthood. The pets grow based on the player’s overall score.

One of Kimimons most notable features is the way it utilizes the unique hardware features of the iPhone and iPod Touch. It responds to a variety of player actions such as shake for disciplining or washing, pinching &amp; poking for affection, and blowing into the mic to give affection or to dry.

== Features ==
* '''Food''' - Kimimons are fed niblets throughout the first stage. In the following stages, players gain access to the Food Market to purchase food items. Food items at the store alternate daily. Each food item affects the health and diet levels of the pet differently.
* '''Clothes''' – Beginning the second stage, Kimimon can start wearing clothing items such as hats, sunglasses purchased from the store in the village. Clothing items at the store alternate daily. Once the pet reaches the adult stage, it can begin purchasing clothing items from a second clothing store for the body including tops, bottoms, shoes, and other accessories.
* '''Camera''' – Snapshots of the pet can be taken from the home screen which are then stored in the Photo application in the iPhone or iPod Touch.
* '''Modpod''' – The Modpod in the village allows users to change the looks of their pets. There are twelve modifiable groups of physical features which become available throughout the game.
* '''Bank''' – Starting from the second stage, players start earning a daily allowance. The amount of allowance is determined by the health level last recorded in the previous play session.
* '''Minigames''' – Players can earn more money on top of their allowance by playing mini-games. It is possible to earn huge sums of money if players do well in mini-games.
* '''Bath''' – In order to keep cleanliness levels down, players must remove their pet’s waste as well as give it baths regularly.
* '''Affection''' – Kimimons can be disciplined as well as kissed, petted, teased, hugged, and poked.
* '''Requests''' – One way to earn coins and accelerate the growth of the pet is by responding to specific requests made by the pet. Each request that is satisfied rewards the player with coins and/or points.
* '''Medicine''' – The pets can die if their health status deteriorates due to neglect in its happiness, hunger, and cleanliness levels. At the Pharmacy, players have the option to purchase medicine which helps increase their health levels.

== Level up ==

There are five stages of growth and eight intermediate ones which unlock unique physical features in the Modpod.

[[Vice Admiral]] '''Lancelot Ernest Holland''', [[Companion of the Order of the Bath|CB]] (13 September 1887 &amp;ndash; 24 May 1941) commanded the British force in the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]] in May 1941 against the [[German battleship Bismarck|German battleship ''Bismarck'']]. Holland was killed during the battle.

==Early life==
Lancelot Holland was one of six sons and a daughter of a doctor who was also a brewer for the firm [[Hunt Edmunds]]. He was born in [[Middleton Cheney]] and was raised in the [[Banbury]] area. He entered the [[Royal Navy]] on 15 May 1902. On leaving [[HMS Prince of Wales (1860)|HMS ''Britannia'']] in September 1903, he was drafted to the [[China Station]] to join [[HMS Eclipse (1894)|HMS ''Eclipse'']]. He served in the Far East until August 1905. The latter part of his time there was spent in [[HMS Hampshire (1903)|HMS ''Hampshire'']].

Returning home, he saw brief service during the summer of 1908 in the Admiralty surveying ship HMS ''Research''. However, the surveying service proved not to be Holland's forte and three years later on 14 September 1911 the young Lieutenant Holland joined [[HMS Excellent (shore establishment)|HMS ''Excellent'']], the Royal Navy's gunnery school at [[Whale Island, Portsmouth]] to start the 'Long Course' which would qualify him as a lieutenant (G).

Having qualified as a gunnery lieutenant and gone on to take the advanced gunnery course at [[Greenwich]], Holland spent the First World War in a teaching role aboard HMS ''Excellent''. After the war he was promoted to commander on 31 December 1919 and [[captain (Royal Navy)|captain]] on 30 June 1926.

During the period May 1929 to February 1931, Holland was [[flag captain]] to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron, aboard [[HMS Hawkins (D86)|HMS ''Hawkins'']]. From May 1931 to September 1932, Holland headed the British Naval Mission to [[Greece]]. As a [[rear admiral]] he was flag captain aboard the battleship [[HMS Revenge (06)|HMS ''Revenge'']] from July 1934 to July 1935.

==Senior officer==

After a 1937 stint as naval [[Aide-de-camp|ADC]] to King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]], he was promoted to [[Rear admiral]] and became commander of the [[3rd Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|3rd Battle Squadron]] of the [[British Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]] in January 1938, flying his flag in [[HMS Resolution (09)|HMS ''Resolution'']] and  then commander of the [[2nd Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|2nd Battle Squadron]], in August 1939 he was appointed Rear-Admiral, Commanding, [[Channel Force]] in September 1939.  He then became [[Admiralty]] representative at the [[Air Ministry]]. He was promoted to [[Vice Admiral]]  backdated to Aug 1940 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dreadnoughtproject.org/tfs/index.php/Lancelot_Ernest_Holland&lt;/ref&gt; after commanding  Cruiser Force H during the [[Battle of Cape Spartivento]] on 27 Nov 1940.

==Second World War==
From July 1940, Holland commanded the [[7th Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|7th Cruiser Squadron]], serving in the [[Mediterranean]].  During the course of this command he led his cruisers in the [[Battle of Cape Spartivento]] on 27 November 1940.

By this time, Holland had established himself as a gunnery specialist.

===The North Atlantic and nemesis===
{{Main|Battle of the Denmark Strait}}
Holland's next assignment was in command of the [[Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|Battlecruiser Squadron]].  Britain had only three of these ships.  They were [[capital ships]] that carried heavy guns, but sacrificed armour protection for speed.  They were a concept of Admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John Fisher]] before the [[First World War]]. Conventional naval thinking in the 1920s and 1930s was that the battlecruiser was designed to hunt and overtake fast commerce raiders, such as a [[pocket battleship]] or another battlecruiser, a ship too powerful for a cruiser to destroy and too fast for a battleship to catch. {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} was the last battlecruiser built by the Royal Navy.

Until the KGV class, also at 28 knots, no British battleship was fast enough to catch the new German battleship ''Bismarck''. Her mission was to evade action and make for the open seas to attack convoys.  ''Hood'' was needed to stop her.  The navy recognized that ''Hood'' needed to be rebuilt to strengthen her decks to protect the vulnerable magazines but by 1938, with war threatening, the [[Admiralty]] felt that they could not risk taking her out of commission. Britain had only three battlecruisers to match the three German [[pocket battleships]].

In May 1941, the new German battleship ''Bismarck'' attempted to break out into the [[North Atlantic]], accompanied by the [[heavy cruiser]] ''Prinz Eugen''.  Their mission was to attack [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[convoys]].  Holland flew his flag aboard ''Hood'', which was accompanied by the new battleship [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']], which mounted ten 14" guns as opposed to the eight 15" on the ''Hood'' and the ''Bismarck''.  On 22 May, just after midnight, [[HMS Electra (H27)|''Electra'']], [[HMS Achates (H12)|''Achates'']], ''Antelope'', [[HMS Anthony (H40)|''Anthony'']], ''Echo'', and [[HMS Icarus (D03)|''Icarus'']], escorting the ''Hood'' and ''Prince Of Wales'', sailed to cover the northern approaches.  ''Prince of Wales'' had not had time to complete the training of her new crew, and was pressed into service with builders' representatives still aboard.  The intention was that the force would refuel in [[Hvalfjord]], [[Iceland]], and then sail again to watch the Denmark Strait.  On the evening of 23 May, the weather deteriorated.  At 20:55, Admiral Holland aboard the ''Hood'' signalled the destroyers "If you are unable to maintain this speed I will have to go on without you.  You should follow at your best speed."  At 02:15 on the morning of 24 May, the destroyers were ordered to spread out at 15 mile intervals to search to the north.

At about 05:35, the German forces were sighted by the ''Hood'' and, shortly afterwards, the Germans sighted the British ships.  In the ensuing [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]] the ''Hood'' suffered a catastrophic magazine explosion at 06:01 that broke the ship in half; the admiral and all but three of the crew of 1,418 were lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmshood.com/admin/faq.htm#faq8 |title=HMS ''Hood'' Association: Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=HMS ''Hood'' Association |accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the survivors, [[Ted Briggs]], later stated he last saw Holland sitting in his admiral's chair, [[The captain goes down with the ship|making no attempt to escape from the sinking wreck]].&lt;ref&gt;Hood and Bismarck by David Mearns and Rob White&lt;/ref&gt;

''Prince of Wales'' made her escape with some damage, including a hit on her bridge which killed many of her officers.  One of the salvos from ''Prince of Wales'' damaged ''Bismarck''{{'}}s fuel tanks, and prompted her to make for [[German occupation of France|occupied France]].

Holland was posthumously [[Mentioned in Despatches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35307 |date=10 October 1941 |page=5947 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
[[File:Admiral Holland, Banbury - geograph-4211652-by-Jaggery.jpg|thumb|The ''Admiral Holland'' public house, Banbury]]
Admiral Holland was married to Phyllis and had one son, John, who died of [[polio]] at the age of 18 in 1935.

Admiral Holland and his family attended the [[Church of England|Anglican]] parish Church of [[St John the Baptist]] at Boldre in the [[New Forest]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]].  They had a memorial to their son installed there and later a [[Hood Memorial Chapel]] was dedicated.  An annual memorial service is held to remember Admiral Holland and the crew of the ''Hood''. A public house in [[Banbury]], The Admiral Holland, was named after him. This pub was demolished in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Pictures: Banbury’s Admiral Holland meets its maker|url=https://www.banburyguardian.co.uk/news/in-pictures-banbury-s-admiral-holland-meets-its-maker-1-7943796|website=Banbury Guardian|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Linn Banks''' (January 23, 1784 &amp;ndash; January 13, 1842) was a 19th-century politician and lawyer, who served 26 years in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] (including two decades as its Speaker), but resigned in order to run for the U.S. Congress. He served one term and appeared re-elected, although that election was successfully contested by future Virginia governor and Confederate General [[William Smith (Virginia governor)|Extra Billy Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Biographical Encyclopedia (1902)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CongBio|B000115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

He was born in what was then [[Culpeper County, Virginia]] (today part of [[Madison County, Virginia|Madison County]]) to parents Adam Banks and Gracey James. He married on April 2, 1811 in Wake, North Carolina to Eliza Jane Hunter Sanders.&lt;ref&gt;Wake Co., NC Marriages (bonds) and International Genealogical Index, batch M5106002, p 2898 - extraction of county marriage records&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the great, great grandson of Adam Bankes, emigrant to [[Stafford County, Virginia]] from the [[Wigan, Lancashire]] area of England in the mid-17th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=rayhbanksjr&amp;id=I40568&lt;/ref&gt;
Banks received a private education, then attended the [[College of William &amp; Mary]]&lt;ref&gt;Mrs. P.W. Hiden, "Adam Banks of Stafford Co., VA", Tyler's Quarterly, vol 15, p 248&lt;/ref&gt; studied law.&lt;ref name="American Congress 1971, p 548"&gt;Biographical Directory of the American Congress,  1774-1971, GPO, 1971, p 548.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Admitted to the Virginia bar in 1809, Banks interrupted his legal practice to serve in the War of 1812.&lt;ref&gt;Yowell's History of Madison County, Virginia, p 68&lt;/ref&gt; He would ultimately resume practicing law, as well as lead the local   [[Virginia Militia]] for decades, hence his honorific as "[[colonel]]". In  1824, Banks hosted the [[Marquis de Lafayette]] on his return visit to Virginia, when he visited President Madison and local militia units in Culpeper and Orange Counties.&lt;ref&gt;Mrs. P. W. Hiden, "Adam Banks of Stafford Co., VA", Tyler's Quarterly,  vol 15, p 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Madison County voters elected Banks as one of their two (part time) representatives in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] in November 1812, and re-elected him many times over more than 25 years. He served from 1812 to 1838, alongside veteran William Morgan until 1814, then Daniel Field, George H. Allen, Robert Hill, Robert L. Madison, Robert Briggs and William Finks. When the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830 instituted single member districts, Banks continued to represent Madison County. He also served as Speaker of the House for two decades, from 1817 to 1838.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia's General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978) pp. xv, 270, 274, 278, 282, 286, 289, 290, 293, 294, 298, 299, 203, 304, 308, 309, 313, 314, 318, 319, 323, 324, 328, 329, 333, 334, 338, 339, 343, 344, 348, 349, 355, 356, 359, 360, 363, 364, 367, 368, 371, 372, 375, 376, 379, 380, 384, 385&lt;/ref&gt;

Banks ran as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and won election to the [[United States House of Representatives]] to fill the seat vacated by [[John M. Patton]]'s resignation in 1838. He only serving until 1841, despite presenting credentials to the following Congress. Although he had appeared re-elected by a narrow vote over former State Senator [[William "Extra Billy" Smith]], Banks lost the recount, so Smith assumed that congressional seat.&lt;ref name="American Congress 1971, p 548"/&gt;
Afterward, Banks resumed his legal practice, as well as managed his estates and enslaved labor. He owned 45 slaves in Madison County in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;1820 U.S. Federal Census for Virginia p. 2 of 11&lt;/ref&gt;, and more than 40 slaves in 1840&lt;ref&gt;1840 U.S. Federal Census for Madison County, Virginia, p. 8 of 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;the 1830 U.S. Federal Census for Madison County is difficult to read because of ink bleed-through)&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Death and legacy==

However, Banks drowned on January 13, 1842 while attempting to ford the [[Conway River (Virginia)|Conway River]] near [[Wolftown, Virginia]]. He was interred in the family cemetery on his estate called "Vale Evergreen" near [[Graves Mill, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="American Congress 1971, p 548"/&gt;

Robert A. Banks, a possible relative, although the marriage license of his 1865 remarriage listed his father as G.J. Banks, married Louisa J. Finks (daughter of this Bank's co-delegate) in 1847, almost a decade after he succeeded to the Madison County House of delegates seat on March 2, 1839, and was re-elected several times, (though he too lost an election contest in 1841 to the same John Booton whom he had unseated in 1838).&lt;ref&gt;Leonard pp. 389, 393, 397, 401, 405, 409, 413, 417, 422, 441, 518&lt;/ref&gt; Robert A. Banks owned about 70 slaves in Madison County in 1850,&lt;ref&gt;1850 U.S. Federal Census, Slave Schedule for Madison County Virginia pp19 and 20 of 57&lt;/ref&gt; and 82 in Madison County in 1860&lt;ref&gt;1860 U.S&gt; Federal Census, Slave Schedule for Madison County, Virginia pp. 53-54 of 59&lt;/ref&gt;

'''María de las Mercedes, Princess of Asturias''' (María de las Mercedes de Borbón y Habsburgo-Lorena) (11 September 1880 &amp;ndash; 17 October 1904), was the eldest child of King [[Alfonso XII of Spain]] and his second wife, [[Maria Christina of Austria]]. She was [[Princess of Asturias]], the [[heir presumptive]] to the Crown of Spain, for all 24 years of her life.

Had her younger sibling, unborn at the death of Alfonso XII, been a daughter, Mercedes would have been [[queen regnant]] of [[Spain]]. The sibling proved to be a boy, [[Alfonso XIII]], and on his birth in 1886, Mercedes turned out not to be queen. She resumed the position of heir presumptive, which she held until her own death, and was succeeded in it by her own infant son Alfonso, Alfonso XIII having not yet married and fathered a legitimate child.

Mercedes married in [[Madrid]] on 14 February 1901, her second cousin, [[Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Two Sicilies]], a nephew of the King of the then-defunct [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]], who was elevated to the rank of [[Infante]] of Spain. The marriage was highly controversial due to her father-in-law's ties with the Carlists. She died three years later from complication while giving birth to her third child.

== Early life ==
Born on 11 September 1880 at the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]], Mercedes was the eldest daughter of [[King Alfonso XII]] and his second wife, [[Maria Christina of Austria]].&lt;ref name=" Puga 175"&gt;Puga 1998, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; She was [[Infant baptism|christened]] María de las Mercedes Isabel Teresa Cristina Alfonsa.&lt;ref name="Mateos115"&gt;Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2007, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Her godmother was [[Isabella II of Spain|Queen Isabella II]], her paternal grandmother, who came from retirement in [[Paris]] to attend the birth of her first grandchild.&lt;ref name="Mateos115"/&gt; There was great disappointment because family and nation were hoping for a boy.&lt;ref name="Mateos115"/&gt; To smooth things out, Queen Maria Christina suggested giving her daughter the name Mercedes in honor of her husband's first wife, [[Mercedes of Orléans]].&lt;ref name=" Puga 175"/&gt;

Mercedes was [[heir presumptive]] from her birth, but the disappointment was so great that she was initially treated only as an ''[[infanta]]''. [[Antonio Cánovas del Castillo]], then head of the government, who disliked Maria Christina and did not want the crown to pass again to a female after the disastrous reign of Isabella II, decided to ignore the newborn.&lt;ref name = "Mateos 116"&gt;Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2007, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Mercedes's paternal aunt [[Isabella, Princess of Asturias (1851–1931)|Isabella]] retained the title of Princess of Asturias until [[Práxedes Mateo Sagasta]], President of the government replacing Cánovas, pressured King Alfonso XII to accord the title to Mercedes, which he did on 10 March 1881.&lt;ref name="BOE-A-1881-1695"&gt;{{cite web|title=Real decreto disponiendo que S. A. R. la Serenísima Sra. Infanta heredera use en adelante el título y la denominación de Princesa de Asturias.|url=https://www.boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1881/070/A00673-00673.pdf|publisher=[[Gaceta de Madrid]]|accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 November 1882, Mercedes gained a sister, [[Infanta Maria Teresa of Spain|Infanta Maria Teresa]]. The marriage of their parents was unhappy. Alfonso had married Maria Christina in order to secure the succession to the throne. He did not love his wife and was disappointed when she gave birth to two daughters, while he already had two extramarital sons. In July 1883, Maria Christina left the Spanish court and traveled with her daughters to visit her own family in Austria.

By the summer of 1884, Alfonso XII's health deteriorated; he had tuberculosis. After a brief improvement, the 27-year-old king died on 25 November 1885 leaving his wife pregnant. The birth of another sister would have made Mercedes queen, but the sibling proved to be a boy, who became [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII]] upon his birth on 17 May 1886. She resumed the position of heir presumptive, which she held for the rest of her life.

== Education ==
[[File:Queen Maria cristina with her three children.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Mercedes with Queen Maria Christina, King Alfonso XIII and Infanta Maria Teresa.]]

Mercedes made her first public appearance at the royal court by the hand of her mother when Queen Maria Christina was declared regent. The education of the Princess of Asturias and her younger sister Infanta Maria Teresa was confined to the Royal Palace of Madrid in an austere environment headed by two widows: their mother and their paternal aunt [[Isabella, Princess of Asturias (1851–1931)|Isabella]] (herself formerly Princess of Asturias).&lt;ref name=" Puga 177"&gt;Puga 1998, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Queen brought up her three children strictly.&lt;ref name=" Puga 177"/&gt; Despite her constitutional status, Mercedes was not given an education that would have prepared her to govern the nation. She received instead the conventional upbringing of princesses of her time. There were piano and painting lessons, knitting practices and the Queen involved her daughter in palace duties.&lt;ref name=" Puga 178"&gt;Puga 1998, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Particular attention was paid to obedience and religious precepts.&lt;ref name=" Puga 178"/&gt;

Mercedes grew up to be a serious young woman, shy and unprepossessing. She was more [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine|Habsburg]] in appearance due to her long face. The family spent the summer months in the Palace of Miramar in [[San Sebastián]].&lt;ref name=" Puga 177"&gt;Puga 1998, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her adolescence, Mercedes accompanied her mother to trips abroad visiting her paternal grandmother in Paris, her paternal aunt [[Infanta María de la Paz of Spain|Paz]] in [[Munich]], and her maternal grandmother [[Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria|Elisabeth Franziska]] in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name=" Puga 178"/&gt; The situation in Spain became more complicated with the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898.&lt;ref name=" Puga 177"/&gt; Mercedes and her sister lived a restricted life. Their conservative mother did not allow them to take part in the social life of the Spanish nobility.&lt;ref name=" Puga 178"/&gt; The Queen offered a party in the Royal Palace to mark the debut in society of her daughters on 9 May 1899, the event having been delayed due to the war.&lt;ref name=" Puga 179"&gt;Puga 1998, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; At the dance, Mercedes fell in love with [[Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Two Sicilies]]; the two were frequently seen together.&lt;ref name=" Puga 182"&gt;Puga 1998, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriage ==
[[File:Mercedes princess of Asturias.jpg|Right|thumb|upright|Mercedes, Princess of Asturias]]

Prince Carlos, Queen Maria Christina's first cousin once removed, belonged to the deposed royal family of the Two Sicilies and had arrived in Spain years earlier in order to follow a military career in the Spanish army.&lt;ref name=" Puga 182"/&gt; The pairing of the princess and Prince Carlos was not accidental. He had been chosen as a prospective husband by both Queen Maria Christina and Infanta Isabella, who was his aunt as well. It was considered paramount to marry Mercedes to a member of the Bourbon family in order to avoid a change of the dynasty in case she succeeded her brother. Prince Carlos offered other advantages as groom to the Princess of Asturias. As he did not belong to a reigning royal family, he could settle permanently in Spain and adopt the necessary Spanish nationality. He had, however, to resign to his rights to the crown of the Two Sicilies as he was third in line after his father and his elder brother.&lt;ref name = "Mateos 214"&gt;Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2007, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlos was of serious character, shy, handsome, and Mercedes was attracted to him.&lt;ref name=" Puga 182"/&gt; Their engagement was announced on December 14, 1899. It immediately faced the strong opposition of the liberal party, the republican faction and a wide spectrum of the Spanish society. There was nothing personal against the Prince himself, but his father, the [[Prince Alfonso, Count of Caserta|Count of Caserta]], had been a general in the last [[Carlist War]] and had taken part in the looting of the city of [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]] by Carlist troops.&lt;ref name = "Mateos 213"&gt;Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2007, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; It was feared that Caserta's son marrying Mercedes would bring the Carlist party too close to the Spanish throne. Even the Prince's name – Carlos – aroused suspicion.&lt;ref name=" Puga 182"/&gt; In addition, the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies was considered the most conservative Catholic dynasty, which worried the liberal party.&lt;ref name=" Puga 182"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mateos 213"&gt;Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2007, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were bitter attacks against Mercedes's marriage in the newspapers and protest on the streets in [[Madrid]], [[Seville]] and [[Granada]]. The Archbishop of [[Valladolid]], one of Spain’s most prominent prelates, wrote a letter to the Queen warning her against the dire consequences if the marriage would take place.&lt;ref name=" Puga 183"&gt;Puga 1998, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen wrote him back: " Monsignor, dedicate yourself to direct your diocese and praying, which are your main obligations, perhaps this way none of the catastrophe you predict will happen".&lt;ref name=" Puga 183"/&gt; Mercedes herself expressed her frustration to the strong opposition to her choice of groom in a letter to her aunt Paz: "I am happy to marry him, but I am also upset at those who have created such a fuzz and made mother suffer for this... all because his father fought alongside [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|don Carlos]]. Is this fair?"&lt;ref name=" Puga 184"&gt;Puga 1998, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy marred the wedding festivities.&lt;ref name = "Mateos 218"&gt;Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2007, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Puga 186"&gt;Puga 1998, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of the wedding, the streets leading to the Royal Palace were barricaded for fear of the protesters and a vast number of troops deployed through the capital. There were no major incidents, however, and the ceremony took place on 14 February 1901 in the chapel of the Royal Palace of [[Madrid]].&lt;ref name = "Mateos 218"&gt;Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2007, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Puga 186"&gt;Puga 1998, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple lived at the Royal palace of Madrid in close proximity to Queen Maria Christina, as she herself had wished.&lt;ref name = "Mateos 219"&gt;Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2007, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;  The union was happy and two children were born in quick succession: [[Infante Alfonso, Duke of Calabria|Prince Alfonso]] (1901–1964) and [[Infante Ferdinand of Spain|Prince Fernando]] (1903–1905).

Pregnant for the third time, Mercedes longed for a daughter after having two sons. In September 1904, she turned twenty four years old. The following month, twenty days before her due day, Mercedes fell seriously ill.&lt;ref name = "Mateos 245"&gt;Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2007, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;  She had [[appendicitis]] which initially was misdiagnosed as simple intestinal cramps.&lt;ref name = "Mateos 245"/&gt; [[Peritonitis]] set in and on the early hours on 16 October 1904 Mercedes gave birth prematurely to her third child, [[Princess Isabel Alfonsa of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|Princess Isabella Alfonsa]] (1904–1985).&lt;ref name = "Mateos 245"/&gt;

The health of the mother was so seriously compromised that little attention was given to the child, who was believed to have been [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] until the young King Alfonso realized the baby was alive.&lt;ref name = "Mateos 245"/&gt; Mercedes died the following day, on 17 October 1904, surrounded by her family.&lt;ref name = "Mateos 245"/&gt;

Mercedes' three children were left in the care of Queen Maria Christina and raised in the court of King Alfonso XIII. The elder son was not given the title of Prince of Asturias, but replaced his mother as heir presumptive.&lt;ref name = "Mateos 247"&gt;Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2007, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Metallo''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|t|æ|l|oʊ}}) ('''John Corben''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], commonly as an adversary of [[Superman]]. Created by [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] and [[Al Plastino]], the character first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #252 (May 1959).

Metallo is depicted as a [[cyborg]] with a [[kryptonite]] power source, which he uses as a weapon against Superman. In 2009, Metallo was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 52nd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-comic-book-villains/52|title=The Top 100 Comic Book Villains|last=|first=|date=2009|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication history ==
Metallo was created by [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] and [[Al Plastino]] and debuted in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #252 (May 1959). John Corben and Metallo first appeared in the daily newspaper strip called "The Menace of Metallo", which ran from 15 December 1958 to 4 April 1959.

There was an earlier "Metalo" who appeared in ''World's Finest'' #6 (Summer 1942). This was just a man who discovered the most powerful metal on earth and invented a strength serum.

== Fictional character biography ==
=== The Golden Age Metal&lt;!-- The character's name has only one L --&gt;o ===
The [[Kal-L|Golden Age Superman]] battled an unnamed scientist calling himself '''Metalo''' who wore a powered suit of steel armor.&lt;ref&gt;''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #6 (Summer 1942)&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Superman encountered the villain a second time.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Superman Family]]'' #217 (April 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; Metalo (now named George Grant) had a new suit of armor and had also taken a serum to increase his strength to superhuman levels. He exposed Superman to a ray that reduced his power significantly giving Metalo superior strength in their first battle. Superman engaged in a lengthy regimen of exercise and training to restore his powers and returned to easily defeat Metalo.

=== First Silver Age Metallo ===
[[File:superman family217.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''Superman Family'' #217 (April 1982). Artwork by [[Rich Buckler]] (pencils) and [[Dick Giordano]] (inks).]]
A different Metallo appeared as Jor-El's robot to battle [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]], in ''Superboy'' #49 (1956).

=== John Corben ===
John Corben was originally a [[journalist]] (and secretly a [[thief]] and [[murderer]]) who had just committed what he thought was the perfect [[murder]]. While fleeing from the scene of the crime, he suffered a near-fatal accident that mangled his body beyond repair. An elderly scientist, Professor Vale, happened to come upon him and used his scientific skill to transfer Corben's brain into a robotic body covered by a flesh-like artificial skin. Corben discovered that his power source, a capsule of [[uranium]], would only last a day, but was told by Vale that kryptonite would provide him an indefinite power supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia|last= |first= |year=2004|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Limited|isbn=0-7566-0592-X|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining a job with the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', Corben briefly tried to romance [[Lois Lane]], while deciding that he would use his powers to eliminate Superman, the one person who might expose his criminal deeds. After setting a kryptonite death-trap for Superman, Corben stole what he thought was another sample of kryptonite from a museum as a new power supply, not knowing it was a fake prop; this mistake caused him to die, just as he was about to kill Lois Lane for discovering that he was not Superman (he had pretended to be him, being super-strong and invulnerable as a cyborg). Superman eventually escaped from the kryptonite trap, and arrived just after Metallo (John Corben) had died. (Action #252, May, 1959)

=== The Bronze Age Metallo ===
A second Metallo, John's brother '''Roger Corben''', debuted in ''Superman'' &lt;!-- only denote volume number after first --&gt; #310 (April 1977) by [[Curt Swan]] and [[Martin Pasko]]. This Metallo was created by a secret organization named "[[SKULL (DC Comics)|SKULL]]" that transferred Roger's brain into a new robotic body so that he could get revenge on Superman for his brother's death. Like the previous Metallo, this one was also powered by kryptonite, although this newer version wore orange and green armor, as well as a green helmet to conceal the "new" identity he had created using plastic surgery (which turned out to be WGBS Staffer Martin Korda).

This version of Metallo returned throughout the Bronze Age. His final appearance was featured in Alan Moore's "[[Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]" (1986).&lt;ref&gt;'''Superman''' Vol. 1 #423&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Modern Age Metallo ===
[[File:Metallo.jpg|thumb|Metallo as drawn by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] in ''Superman'' (volume 2) #1 (January 1987).]]
After [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] rewrote Superman's origins in the 1986 miniseries ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'', Metallo was also given an altered backstory.

In this version, John Corben was a small-time con man who was fatally injured in a car crash, but thanks to luck, Professor Emmet Vale happened to pass by. Professor Vale was a pioneer in [[robotics]] and erroneously believed that Superman was the first in a wave of superpowered [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] invaders after recovering Superman's ship and mistranslating Jor-El's message to his son. Vale transplanted Corben's [[brain]] into a [[robot]]ic alloy body, which was powered by a two-pound chunk of [[kryptonite]], and instructed him to kill Superman. Metallo, now Corben's new moniker, thanked Vale by snapping his neck and killing him.

Despite ignoring Vale's commands, Metallo came into conflict with Superman on various occasions, largely due to his continued activities as a petty thug. Metallo later lost his kryptonite heart to [[Lex Luthor]], though back-up life support systems allowed him to reactivate himself and escape. He remained a thorn in Superman's side and was powerful enough to cripple the [[Doom Patrol]]. Still, the Indian-born hero who called herself [[Celsius (comics)|Celsius]] did blow him apart with her thermal powers. Metallo later received a major upgrade via an unholy bargain with the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]]. As a result, Metallo could morph his body into any mechanical shape he could imagine (turning his hands into guns or "growing" a jet-pack from his back) and project his consciousness into any [[technology|technological]] or metallic device. He could also grow to monstrous size. During one battle, his gigantic fists were separated and later turned into housing by other superheroes. In another incident, Metallo was rendered more insane by the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and used his height to destroy an elevated train of commuters.

As Superman and others learned on various occasions, the most effective way to neutralize Metallo was to remove his (largely invulnerable) head and isolate it from other metallic items.

In ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #2 (November 2003), Lex Luthor fabricated evidence implicating John Corben as the criminal who shot and killed Thomas and Martha Wayne, the parents of [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Superman: Secret Origin'' ====
In the 2009-10 [[miniseries]] ''[[Superman: Secret Origin]]'', (which retells the origins of Superman and his supporting cast), Metallo is Sgt. John Corben. He serves under Lois Lane's father, General [[Sam Lane (comics)|Sam Lane]]. General Lane is trying to push his daughter, Lois into a relationship with Corben. Though they had one date, she does not return his feelings for her. Corben is next seen signing up for a military option to neutralize [[Superman]] (ostensibly with the help of a [[Powered exoskeleton|powersuit]] built by [[LexCorp]]). However, in his first encounter with Superman, a stray bullet hit the Kryptonite rock inside the suit, leading to a disastrous energy cascade within the battlesuit which almost killed Corben. Through the efforts of Lex Luthor and a crack team of scientists, Corben survived, part-man, part-machine, with the Kryptonite rock functioning as his new heart. Driven by a hatred for this alien invader, he became the villain known as Metallo. Metallo, now wearing a green, orange and red armor, subsequently attacked Superman again in a rampage which endangered not only the citizens of Metropolis, but his own fellow soldiers. He was defeated by Superman once more.

=== The New 52 ===
==== Project: Metal-0 ====
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, John Corben is under the command of General Sam Lane.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' Vol. 2 #1 (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; General Lane tells him to talk to Lois Lane, when she keeps questioning where Superman is. It is implied that Corben and Lois once had a relationship. When Superman escapes from the military's custody, Corben is seen enlisting in what appears to be a military project co-opted by Lex Luthor, General Lane, and young scientist Doctor [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|John Henry Irons]] – "Project Steel Soldier" – to go against Superman.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' Vol. 2 #2 (October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Corben is seen in the "Metal 0" suit with scientists, mostly Irons, trying to help him. He continues believing that he did it for the affection of Lois and when the robotic needles are in his head, Metallo takes control and his heart bursts. Metallo then screams "Where is Superman?"&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' Vol. 2 #3 (November 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the attack on Superman succeeds, Metallo is revealed to have been subverted by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] as part of his own plans, and his rampage is defeated when Doctor Irons uses an armoured suit of his own to fight Corben and upload a computer virus that he designed in the event of such a situation.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' Vol. 2 #4 (December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; After escaping, and still under Brainiac's control, Corben continued to fight Superman&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' Vol. 2 #7 (March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; until he was able to reason with Metallo and to fight Brainiac's influence because of his feelings for Lois Lane. In doing so, Corben attacked Brainiac until Superman could defeat the villain, but he subsequently fell into a coma and was taken back by the army.

==== Forever Evil ====
It was revealed that the armor was keeping him alive thanks to alien technology, but without a heart he would soon die. General Lane told his scientists to find a way to save him since he helped to save Metropolis. He was later given a kryptonite heart to keep him alive since it was the only energy compatible with his cybernetics.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' Vol. 2 #8 (April 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; After thirty-one months in a vegetative state, Corben was brought back with a shard of kryptonite to active duty in the U.S. Army. Since his actions caused the deaths of hundreds of civilians, General Lane tried to kill him by exploding the plane he was being carried in. He survived, and sought vengeance against Lane at his base, only to be confronted by an upgraded soldier like himself "Metal-2.0". When Corben proves too much, Metal-2.0 activates his self-destruct mechanism, hoping to destroy Corben along with himself. However, he is saved by the Scarecrow, and offered a place in the Secret Society of Super Villains, now calling himself Metallo. In "Forever Evil", [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]] rips off his kryptonite heart, because of his addiction to the mineral.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Doomed ====
Corben was eventually seen again incarcerated in John Henry's isolated super prison, eventually drafted by the U.S. Government again shortly afterwards but is only brought back into their service by compunction from Lois once more (who was secretly under Brainiac's influence).&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' Vol. 2 #31 (Jul 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Given the present danger he represents as doomsday was taking him over, Lois convinced Metallo to run Superman down in a kryptonite bombing run and was summarily incinerated by the blast; all that was left of him being the Metal Zero exo-mantel fused to his now charred remains.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' Vol. 2 #32 (Aug 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Lois, now completely subsumed by the Brainiac consciousness inside of her, is able to recreate Corben's essential self by downloading her memory of the man he was into whats left of his old Metal-0 suit. Said facsimile of the now deceased military sergeant a loyal echo of whom he once was obedient to her every whim.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman/Wonder Woman'' Vol. 1 #10 (Sep. 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; He would serve as her bodyguard as Dox's influence compelled her to cripple military defense systems around the world, he would immediately switch sides once Lois is freed from his control however and aid her in combating the alien threat to their world.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' Annual #3 (Sep. 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; As Superman and Lois departed to stop brainiac, Metallo was left on earth to defend metropolis in their stead.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' Vol. 2 #34 (Oct. 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; After the crisis is resolved Corben is later seen standing guard over Metropilis with [[Krypto]] seemingly contented with his current position.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' Vol. 2 #35 (Nov. 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Truth/Savage Dawn ====
In wake of Superman's identity being outed to the world as the hero began losing his powers, many an investigation was undertaken into his identity, contacts and motives by collective interests. Seeing as her life was in more danger than ever before, Metallo stuck close to his love as she went and did some investigating of her own in the meantime.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman/Superman'' Vol. 1 #23 (Oct 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Vandal Savage]] made his play for ultimate power, Lois and Metallo were close by on the scene where Superman kept his warship from crushing a small town. While aiding Superman as Lois refused to leave his side during the battle with Savage's empowered progeny, John's bionic shell was badly damaged. Looking to make good with all the bad in his life he willingly offered his Kryptonite heart to Superman (the depowered hero having discovered a treatment for his loss of powers that essentially involved giving himself chemotherapy with kryptonite), knowing full well he couldn't survive without it.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman'' Vol. 3 #49 (Apr. 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Powers and abilities ==
Metallo’s metallic body offers him a high degree of protection from physical and energy attacks. He has enhanced abilities and no longer needs to eat, sleep, or breathe. His brain is hermetically sealed inside a shielded alloy skull that has its own power supply. When he was first created, he was powered by a kryptonite heart; losing that he subsisted on plutonium instead. Additionally, because of his cyborg body, Metallo possesses superhuman strength and speed, enough to pose a challenge and even a threat to opponents such as Superman (in that case, he also takes advantage of the weakening power of kryptonite besides his own strength).

Over the course of his criminal career Metallo's body would be decimated constantly by various circumstances. As such he would receive numerous upgrades or whole new chassis' to replace his damaged parts, such as by the obscure supervillain organization Cerberus which modified him with a vastly superior body, one with lead lined skull-plating and an anatomic layer even Superman could not demolish.&lt;ref&gt;''Adventures of Superman'' (1987) #491&lt;/ref&gt; This gave him greatly enhanced strength and durability, coupled with moderate mechanical regeneration to repair internal damage.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' (1938) #678&lt;/ref&gt; He was later outfitted with a larger LexCorp tech. body which gave him laser vision and further augmented his physical abilities.&lt;ref&gt;''Damage'' (1994) #1&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after it was destroyed, Corben had received a new body from fellow Kryptonite powered supervillain, [[Conduit (comics)|Conduit]]; which gave Metallo radioactive blasts from his hands and could utilize [[Geomagnetism]] to make him physically immovable, even by the Man of Steel, so long as he stood on solid ground or flooring within a building complex.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' (1938) #710&lt;/ref&gt;

Metallo would eventually sell his soul (or what was left of it) to the archdemon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] for increased power in return,&lt;ref&gt;''Underworld Unleashed'' (1995) #1&lt;/ref&gt; gaining the ability to mentally control and absorb any mechanical or metal object he focuses on, transforming any technology (himself included) into an extension of his exo-skeleton (an ability similar to the [[Cyborg Superman]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Steel'' (1994) #21&lt;/ref&gt;

In experimenting with his newfound abilities, Metallo found he could alternate differing energy frequencies for harnessing and redistributing it from various power sources.&lt;ref&gt;''Adventures of Superman''' Vol 1 #546&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brainiac 13]] upgraded Metallo to tap into various light spectra to better utilize his kryptonite charged abilities. His mech body was also upgraded to grow towards monolithic proportions.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman: Man of Steel'' Vol 1 98&lt;/ref&gt; He is also occasionally portrayed as having a [[liquid metal]]-based endoskeleton, possessing the ability to morph parts of his body, specifically his limbs, into different weapons or tools, such as chainsaws, shovels, hammers, etc. While not a genius like Lex or Brainiac, Corben's time spent with machines has given him a gifted understanding of how they work, enabling him to tinker with their mechanical functions even before gaining his technomorphing capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;''Doom Patrol'' (1987) #10&lt;/ref&gt;

During the publishing of ''Salvation Run'' it is revealed Metallo also boasts a high-calculus cyber mind with which to run the numbers of possible and probable outcomes and success scenarios through. In previous continuity, the Pre-''Flashpoint'' Lex Luthor modified Corben to holster and utilize different forms of Kryptonite; boasting mutagenic Red-K, inverted Blue-K and lastly, artificial depowering Gold-K on top of the green he already possessed.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics Annual'' Vol 1 #10&lt;/ref&gt; He could even power a great many Anti-Kryptonian armaments developed by Luthor through it.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics Annual'' Vol 1 #11&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other versions ==
*Metallo appeared in ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'' as a project (among many others) invented by [[Lex Luthor|Dr. Lex Luthor]] for the [[US government]] to combat Superman, who serves Communist Russia.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman: Red Son'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Marvel Comics]] cover-featured an unrelated character named Metallo in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' 16 (April 1961).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/16205/ |title=GCD :: Issue :: Tales of Suspense #16 |publisher=Comics.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Silver Age Metallo appears in the series ''[[Justice (comics)|Justice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Art Baltazar's ''Superman Family Adventures'', Jack Corben was an astronaut who became sick after flying through a kryptonite asteroid field. Lex Luthor manipulates him into believing that it's all Superman's fault and that he can help Jack if Jack defeats Superman. Jack gets the upper hand in the fight with his kryptonite, but the Superman family is aided by John Henry Irons into trapping Jack in a lead case. This version is not a cyborg, but instead has a large metallic armor that contains all his kryptonite poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman: Family Adventures'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===

====Live-action====
* In the second-season ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' episode "Metallo", Roger Corben (played by [[Michael Callan]]), a bungling bank robber, tries to rob an armored car even though he is having extreme chest pains. Superboy arrives and apprehends the bank robber, but the small-time crook has a heart attack and is taken to a hospital. After a lengthy recuperation, he escapes by murdering his doctor. After he leaves, he suffers another heart attack and his car crashes into a tree and explodes. The police assume he is dead, but journalist Clark Kent is not so sure. Meanwhile, Corben is alive. He falls into the hands of a mentally-unbalanced doctor who turns him into more of a machine than human being and replaces his failing human heart with the radioactive power source kryptonite. As Metallo, Corben made several more appearances in the ''Superboy'' series, specifically in the episodes "Super Menace", "People Vs. Metallo", "Threesome" (parts 1 and 2), and "Obituary for A Super-Hero".
* In the second-season ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman|Lois &amp; Clark]]'' episode "Metallo", Johnny Corben (played by [[Scott Valentine (actor)|Scott Valentine]]) was [[Lucy Lane]]'s boyfriend and, unknown to her, a petty criminal. Not only does he have a criminal past, but he's hitting up Lucy for money. [[Lois Lane]] tries to convince her sister that Johnny's no good, but Lucy will hear none of it. Johnny was shot when a holdup went wrong and having fallen into the hands of Dr. Emmett Vale, a former [[Lexcorp]] scientist with the help of his brother Rollie Vale, rebuilt Johnny into a Kryptonite-powered cyborg named Metallo and begins causing havoc in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. And, since Metallo is powered by Kryptonite, even Superman can not stop him. When Metallo kidnaps Clark to use him as bait to lure Superman, it's up to Lois and [[Jimmy Olsen]] to save Clark, but nothing can save Metallo after a final run-in with Superman, who, now aware of his kryptonite power source, keeps his distance, using his super breath and heat vision to defeat him. Emmett is captured, but Rollie manages to escape with Metallo's kryptonite, leaving Metallo dead.

[[File:SmallvilleMetallo.jpg|frame|right|110px|[[Brian Austin Green]] as John Corben on ''[[Smallville]]'']]
* In ''[[Smallville]]'', John Corben/Metallo (played by [[Brian Austin Green]] in [[Smallville (season 9)|season nine]], uncredited actor in [[Smallville (season 10)|season ten]]) appears in the season premiere "Savior" as a former war reporter working at the Daily Planet alongside Lois Lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitovich |first=Matt |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Smallville-Brian-Austin-1007034.aspx |title=Smallville Casting Exclusive: Brian Austin Green Is Metallo! - Today's News: Our Take |publisher=TVGuide.com |date=2009-06-17 |accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Metallo", he is revealed to despise the Blur ([[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]]) because the latter rescued a prisoner that went on to murder Corben's sister. After being hit by a truck, he is experimented upon by [[General Zod|Major Zod]]'s Kandorian soldiers and wakes up with bionic appendages, including a kryptonite-powered artificial heart, and targets the Blur in revenge for his sister. Clark, though weakened by the kryptonite radiation, uses a lead plate to defeat Corben, who is recovered by LuthorCorp CEO Tess Mercer. In "Upgrade", Corben's prior insanity was explained as a flaw in his kryptonite heart and Tess' scientists repair him and turn him into a mindless weapon. Corben defeats Zod and a red kryptonite-infected Clark, regaining his free will after the control chip is removed from his head. Corben goes underground after receiving from Lois a red kryptonite heart. Despite regaining his sanity and parting on good terms with Lois and Clark, he is back to being a villain with a green kryptonite heart in "Prophecy", as a part of [[Toyman]]'s team of villains, "Marionette Ventures": he is assigned to target [[Kara Zor-El|Supergirl]]. He appears in the comic book coninuation ''[[Smallville#Smallville Season Eleven|Smallville: Season Eleven]]'' which explains his character change as his biology rejecting the red kryptonite heart and he became a mercenary, tasked by a tyrannical dictatorship in rural country to subdue and eliminate a protector of the rebel forces; who was secretly the Kryptonite empowered Lana Lang. His new Green-K heart given to him by Toyman, had the ability to absorb meteor rock energy signature's serving to make him that much more powerful. When he absorbed the kryptonite powered nanites in Lana Lang's Prometheus augmented biology, they gave him the ability to reach out and assimilate any metallic or mechanical constructions within range, similar to his comic book appearance's technomorphing abilities. He was finally stopped and incarcerated by the U.S. government when Lana and Lois managed to incapacitate him by removing his power source.

====='''Arrowverse'''=====
* There are three different versions of Metallo who appear in [[Arrowverse]]:
** John Corben appears in the episode "The Adventures of Supergirl," portrayed by Frederick Schmidt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/08/30/supergirl-metallo-season-2|title=Supergirl casts Superman villain Metallo — exclusive|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|last=Abrams|first=Natalie|date=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was initially hired by the then-arrested [[Lex Luthor]] to assassinate his sister Lena Luthor to prevent her from rebranding [[LexCorp|Luthor Corp]]. His first two attempts to kill Lena fail due to the intervention of Supergirl and Superman and his third attempt is foiled by [[Alex Danvers]] and Lena who shoots Corben when he tries to take Alex hostage. While being sent to the hospital, he is intercepted by [[Project Cadmus]] who perform an experiment to convert him into Metallo. After meeting Project Cadmus' leader (who was later revealed to be Lex Luthor's mother Lillian), Metallo is unleashed on Supergirl and Superman. While Superman fought the other Metallo, Supergirl received help from Alex Danvers to remove his Kryptonite heart. Afterwards, Supergirl used Metallo's eyes to speak to Project Cadmus to let them know that she will find them. He later is busted out of jail via a smuggled synthetic Kryptonite "heart" brought in by [[Hank Henshaw]] (who also doctored the security footage to make it seem as though Lena Luthor had been the one who smuggled in the heart as part of an elaborate plot to both frame Lena and force her to aid her mother). However, because the synthetic Kryptonite was unstable, Corben was slowly undergoing a radiological meltdown, and ultimately perished via self-destruction despite Supergirl's best efforts to save him.
** Aside from Corben, Project Cadmus scientist '''Dr. Gilcrist''' (portrayed by Rich Ting), was also subjected unwillingly to be the second Metallo model by Lillian Luthor. During his fight with Superman, Martian Manhunter removed Dr. Gilcrist's Kryptonite heart shutting him down.
** An entirely robotic Metallo ('''Metallo-X'''), voiced by Frederick Schmidt, features in the four-part crossover story "[[Crisis on Earth-X]]", linking the shows ''Supergirl'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' and ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]''. It appears as the servant of a Nazi regime led by Oliver Queen and Kara Zor-El, and takes the primary heroes of the aforementioned shows captive. It is eventually destroyed by the combined powers of the shows' characters, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]], [[Black Canary]], [[Killer Frost]], [[Captain Cold|Citizen Cold]], [[Ray (Ray Terrill)|the Ray]], [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|the Atom]], [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], [[Isis (DC Comics)|Zari]], [[Vibe (comics)|Vibe]], and [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]]. This marks the first live-action representation of Metallo's appearance in the comics, all previous media having depicted him as mostly human-looking.&lt;ref name="RTMetallo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1728459/two-surprise-arrow-verse-characters-who-will-apparently-get-earth-x-versions-in-the-big-crossover|title=Two Surprise Arrow-verse Characters Who Will Apparently Get Earth-X Versions In The Big Crossover|last=Joest|first=Mick|publisher=Cinema Blend|date=November 21, 2017|accessdate=November 22, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6vB1dNL6E?url=https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1728459/two-surprise-arrow-verse-characters-who-will-apparently-get-earth-x-versions-in-the-big-crossover|archivedate=November 23, 2017|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Animation====
[[File:Metallo2 1 .png|frame|thumb|Metallo, as depicted in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'']]
* John Corben/Metallo appears in several animated series set in the [[DC Animated Universe]]:
** He made his debut in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by veteran actor [[Malcolm McDowell]]. John Corben was originally an English [[mercenary|criminal-for-hire]], who was eventually caught and jailed by Superman. During his time in prison, Corben contracted a rare and fatal disease. His past employer (and the person responsible for Corben being infected by the disease), [[Lex Luthor]], then offered him a new lease on life by transferring his consciousness into a robotic body, and in exchange Corben would kill Superman for Luthor. The android body is made of an indestructible alloy called "Metallo", and is powered by a kryptonite power source to use against the Man of Steel. However, Corben soon learned that his new body had no sense of taste, smell or touch, and this sensory deprivation drove him insane. Realizing he was no longer the man he once was, Corben dubbed himself "Metallo".
** Metallo returns in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Hereafter", voiced by [[Corey Burton]]. He appears as a member of the [[Superman Revenge Squad]].
** Malcolm McDowell reprised his role as Metallo in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', where he is a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]]. He, along with [[Silver Banshee]], are sent on a mission to [[Skartaris]] to obtain a large kryptonite rock, but are ultimately defeated by the Justice League. When he attempts to tell the League about the new Secret Society, his brain is fried by a protocol [[Grodd]] secretly programmed into him.
* Metallo appeared in season 5 of the animated series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', voiced by [[Lex Lang]]. His kryptonite heart is not in his center, but in the upper left quadrant of his chest. Also, Metallo has a back-up power source and can operate without the kryptonite heart. Metallo was paid by [[Lex Luthor]] to kill [[Superman]]. Because of the kryptonite, Superman fought a losing battle until [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] showed up. They managed to get the kryptonite out of Metallo long enough for Superman to recover. After he recovered, Superman defeated Metallo by trapping him in a hydraulic compactor, although it is said that a certain type of battery keeps him alive. His origin is not given.
* Metallo makes a cameo appearance as one of the villains Superman and Batman take down together in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]''. Superman is wrestling with Metallo on top of a building when Metallo exposes his kryptonite heart and weakens Superman. Batman comes and uses a grappling hook to pull the kryptonite heart from the center of Metallo's chest. Metallo is then easily beaten by Superman with one punch. His design is like the Bronze Age Metallo although much bulkier than Superman.
* Metallo appears in the ''[[Justice League Action]]'' animated short "True Colors". Metallo and Superman fight, while [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], in an attempt to help Superman by turning Metallo's kryptonite heart into lead, turns it into different versions of kryptonite instead, each having different effects on Superman. After Pink Kryptonite turns Superman into a woman, she defeats Metallo, and Firestorm manages to turn his heart to lead.

===Film===
* Metallo appears in the animated movie ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'', which is based on [[Jeph Loeb]]'s 2003 comic book story arc of the same name that appeared in the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' comic book. In the movie, Metallo is voiced by ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' star [[John C. McGinley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=502 |title=The World's Finest |publisher=Worldsfinestonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acts as Lex Luthor's bodyguard who then fights with both Superman and Batman. After they escape him, he is killed by [[Major Force]] and his death is used to [[frameup|frame]] Superman, although a cursory analysis of his body by Batman confirms that he was killed by a radiation blast rather than heat vision.
* Metallo makes a brief appearance in ''[[All-Star Superman (film)|All-Star Superman]]''. He is seen lifting weights when Lex Luthor, escorted by armed guards, and Clark Kent (who is interviewing Lex Luthor), walk past his glass cell. He looks up when they pass by. Clark Kent seemed to shy away from Metallo's cell since it was not made of lead. This led to [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]]'s escape from his cell near Metallo's since Parasite easily absorbed Clark Kent's power from a few meters away. The only reason Superman was not affected by the kryptonite heart was because his overcharged powers made him impervious to it.
* Metallo appears in the animated film ''[[Justice League: Doom]]'', voiced by [[Paul Blackthorne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James|last=Harvey|url= http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php/news.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=1135|title=Warner Home Video Announces Voice Cast For "Justice League: Doom" Animated Film|publisher=Worldsfinestonline.com|date=2011-09-28|accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is part of [[Vandal Savage]]'s [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]], and is his counterpart to Superman. He is more lighthearted than his fellow Legion members, as shown by his attempts to shake [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]'s hand after saying he was a fan of Bane's work, and openly laughing when Vandal Savage presents his plan. He draws Superman's attention by posing as ''[[Daily Planet]]'' reporter Henry Ackerson and heading to the top of the building itself, claiming to commit suicide. [[Lois Lane]] tells Superman about Ackerson, and the Man of Steel flies onto the roof and convinces him not to jump. Metallo then pulls out a gun containing a kryptonite bullet and shoots Superman in the chest and exposing his Kryptonite heart before knocking Superman off the roof and into the streets below. Despite mocking Savage's plan initially, he takes part in it. When the Justice League storms the Hall of Doom, Metallo fights Superman, gaining the upper hand using his kryptonite heart to weaken the Man of Steel. Despite holding off Superman for most of the fight, once Savage launches his missile Superman slammed the plating containing Metallo's heart over the kryptonite, forcibly trapping it before Superman uses his heat vision to [[decapitate]] Metallo. Metallo's head was most likely reattached and he was put into custody.
* Metallo was initially considered to be the [[antagonist]] in [[Zack Snyder]]'s ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' sequel, but the project was eventually cancelled in favor of ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''. His creator, Emmet Vale, appears in ''Dawn of Justice'', portrayed by Ralph Lister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jay Jayson |url=http://comicbook.com/2015/07/03/metallo-was-originally-planned-as-villain-in-man-of-steel-sequel/ |title=Metallo Was Originally Planned As Villain In Man Of Steel Sequel |publisher=Comicbook.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Batman-V-Superman-Casting-Hints-Possibility-Metallo-Future-DC-Comics-Films-119047.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
* Malcolm McDowell reprises his role as Metallo in ''[[Superman: Shadow of Apokolips]]'' as the final [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]].
* Metallo appears as one of the bosses in ''[[Superman (1999 video game)|Superman: The New Adventures]]''.
* Metallo appears as one of the bosses in ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel (2002 video game)|Superman: The Man of Steel]]'', voiced by [[Roger L. Jackson]].
* Metallo appears as a recurring boss in ''[[Superman Returns (video game)|Superman Returns]]'', voiced by [[John Billingsley]]. In the game, he can assimilate metal cars, light poles, etc., to become a larger and stronger version of himself. Metallo eventually realizes he is defeated and shoots a missile, which Superman stops. Superman then tears out Metallo's power source.
* Metallo appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by Ryan Wickerham.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1327585|DC Universe Online}}''&lt;/ref&gt;

* Metallo appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5cW9PH6C94]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===
* [[Dirk Maggs]]' 1990 [[BBC Radio]] adaptation of ''The Man of Steel'' included Metallo as a major character. In this version, Corben (played by [[Simon Treves]]) was wearing the suit of battle armour that Lex Luthor sent up against Superman. To cover his tracks, Luthor ensured that the suit's psionic interface was unstable, leaving Corben a complete vegetable. He was 'rescued' by Doctor Schwarz, a disgruntled former Lexcorp employee, who had been tracking the capsule that brought the infant Superman to Earth and stole this from the Kents' farm. Having built Corben an android body powered by the capsule's kryptonite power source, they hatched a plan to kill Lex Luthor and Superman. Metallo double-crosses Schwarz and breaks his neck. Kidnapping Lois Lane, Metallo holes up at the power station at Two Mile Island waiting for Superman to face him. During the ensuring battle, Lex Luthor steps in and tears out Metallo's kryptonite heart.

===Toys===
His [[DC Universe Classics]] figure is a Collect and Connect figure in Wave 5 featuring the [[Riddler]] (Head &amp; Torso), [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|The Atom]] (right arm), [[Eradicator (comics)|The Eradicator]] (left arm), [[Amazo]] (right leg), and [[Black Lightning]] (left leg).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6350">[[File:Mexican Standoff.jpg|thumb|Three men pointing guns at one another in an apparent Mexican standoff]]

A '''Mexican standoff''' is a confrontation amongst three or more parties in which no strategy exists that allows any party to achieve victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dealing with Dilemmas: Where Business Analytics Fall Short | author=Buytendijk, Frank | publisher=Wiley | year=2010 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_GFs9zomoSQC | isbn=978-0-470-76848-8 | page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Concise Dictionary of English Combined (idioms, Phrases, Proverbs, Similes) | author=V&amp;S Editorial Board | publisher=V&amp;S Publishers | year=2015 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6E3DwAAQBAJ | page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, all participants need to maintain the strategic tension, which remains unresolved until some outside event makes it possible to resolve it.

The term ''Mexican standoff'' was originally used in the context of using firearms and today still commonly implies a situation in which the parties face some form of threat from the other parties. The Mexican standoff is a recurring [[trope (cinema)|trope in cinema]], in which several armed characters hold each other at gunpoint.

== Etymology ==
The expression came into use during the last decade of the 19th century; the ''[[Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary]]'' makes an unattributed claim that the term is of [[Australia|Australian]] origin.  Other sources{{which|date=June 2015}} claim the reference is to the [[Mexican–American War]] or post-war Mexican bandits in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="worddet" /&gt;

The earliest print cite to the phrase was 19 March 1876 in a short story about Mexico, an American being held up by a Mexican bandit, and the outcome:&lt;ref&gt;"Mexican, n. and adj.". OED Online. March 2018. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"Go-!" said he sternly then. "We will call it a stand-off, a Mexican stand-off, you lose your money, but you save your life!" | F. Harvey Smith | ''Sunday Mercury'', New York, 1876}}

== Popular use ==
In popular use, the term ''Mexican standoff'' is sometimes used in reference to confrontations in which neither opponent appears to have a measurable advantage. Historically, commentators have used the term to reference the [[Soviet Union]]&amp;nbsp;– [[United States]] nuclear confrontation during the [[Cold War]], specifically the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962. The key element that makes such situations ''Mexican standoffs'' is the equality of power exercised among the involved parties.&lt;ref name="worddet"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.word-detective.com/2011/03/mexican-standoff/|title=Mexican standoff|work=The Word Detective|accessdate=2013-03-21}}{{unreliable source?|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inability of any particular party to advance its position safely is a condition common among all standoffs; in a "Mexican standoff," however, there is an additional disadvantage: no party has a safe way to ''withdraw'' from its position, thus making the standoff effectively permanent.

In financial circles, the Mexican standoff is typically used to denote a situation where one side wants something, a concession of some sort, and is offering nothing of value. When the other side sees no value in agreeing to any changes, they refuse to negotiate. Although both sides may benefit from the change, neither side can agree to adequate compensation for agreeing to the change, and nothing is accomplished.

A Mexican standoff where each party is pointing a gun at another is now considered a movie [[cliché]], stemming from its frequent use as a [[plot device]] in cinema. A famous example of the trope is in [[Sergio Leone]]'s 1966 Western ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'', where the titular characters played by [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Lee Van Cleef]] and [[Eli Wallach]] face each other at gunpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SRNB0B5c0DAC&amp;pg=PT96 | title=Professional Storyboarding: Rules of Thumb | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | author=Jew, Anson | year=2013 | pages=83 | isbn=1-136-12677-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lbckmstrbbc"&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160210-the-lasting-legacy-of-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly Buckmaster, Luke. "The lasting legacy of ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly''," BBC.com, Wednesday 10 February 2016.] Retrieved October 26, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Director [[John Woo]], considered a major influence on the [[action genre]], is known for his highly chaotic action sequences, Mexican standoffs, and frequent use of [[slow motion]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pierce|first1=Nev|title=Calling The Shots: John Woo|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/callingtheshots/john_woo.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Quentin Tarantino]] (who has cited Woo as an influence) has featured Mexican standoff scenes in his films like ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (restaurant sequence); ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' (the tavern scene features multiple Mexican standoffs including meta-discussion); and the climactic scene of ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'', which depicts a standoff among four characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YSkQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45 | title=Pulp Fiction: The Complete Story of Quentin Tarantino's Masterpiece | publisher=Voyageur Press | author=Bailey, Jason | year=2013 | pages=45 | isbn=978-0-7603-4479-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Mexican standoff also features prominently in the mission ''The Wrap Up'' in ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', in which a meeting between protagonist Michael De Santa and the FIB quickly devolves into an all out four-way battle among the FIB, IAA and Merryweather agents.

''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' also features a notable Mexican standoff between 6 men, which coincidentally takes place in Mexico. One of the participants also makes a humorous nod to the trope, realizing the situation and claiming ''“There must be a name for this.”''

An '''obstetric labor complication''' is a difficulty or abnormality that arises during the process of [[Childbirth|labor or delivery]].

The [[Trust for America's Health]] reports that as of 2011, about one third of American births have some complications; many are directly related to the mother's health including increasing rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and
physical inactivity.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has led an initiative to improve woman's health previous to conception in an effort to improve both neonatal and maternal death rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Healthy Women, Healthy Babies: How health reform can improve the health of women and babies in America |url= http://healthyamericans.org/assets/files/TFAH%202011HealthyBabiesBrief.pdf |last1= Levi |first1= J. |last2= Kohn |first2= D. |last3= Johnson |first3= K. |publisher= [[Trust for America's Health]] |location= Washington, D.C. |date= June 2011 |accessdate= 2013-08-29 &lt;!-- American Pregnancy Association website --&gt; |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120624230140/http://healthyamericans.org/assets/files/TFAH%202011HealthyBabiesBrief.pdf |archivedate= 2012-06-24 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Amniotic fluid embolism===
An [[amniotic fluid embolism]] (AFE) is a rare childbirth ([[obstetric]]) emergency in which [[amniotic fluid]], enters the blood stream of the mother to trigger a serious reaction. This reaction then results in cardiorespiratory (heart and lung) collapse and massive bleeding ([[coagulopathy]]).&lt;ref name="StaffordSheffield2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stafford|first1=Irene|last2=Sheffield|first2=Jeanne|year=2007|title=Amniotic Fluid Embolism|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America|volume=34|issue=3|pages=545–553|doi=10.1016/j.ogc.2007.08.002|issn=0889-8545}}&lt;sup&gt;[subscription required]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- dated treatment protocols--&gt;&lt;ref name="stein2016"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pulmonary embolism|last=Stein|first=Paul|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc|year=2016|isbn=9781119039099|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK Hoboken, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book|title=Williams manual of pregnancy complications|last=Leveno|first=Kenneth|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|year=2016|isbn=9780071765626|location=New York|pages=223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bleeding===
'''[[Obstetrical bleeding]]''' or hemorrhage, or heavy blood loss, is still the leading cause of death of birthing mothers in the world today, especially in the developing world. Heavy blood loss leads to [[hypovolemic shock]], insufficient perfusion of vital organs and death if not rapidly treated. Blood transfusion may be life saving. Causes of heavy bleeding during labour include [[placental abruption]] and [[uterine rupture]].

===Cord prolapse===
[[Umbilical cord prolapse]] occurs when the [[umbilical cord]] comes out of the [[uterus]] with or before the presenting part of the [[fetus]]. Umbilical cord prolapse should always be considered a possibility when there is a sudden decrease in fetal heart rate or variable decelerations, particularly after the rupture of membranes. With overt prolapses, the diagnosis can be confirmed if the cord can be palpated on vaginal examination. Without overt prolapse, the diagnosis can only be confirmed after a [[cesarean section]], though even then it will not always be evident at time of procedure.&lt;ref name="lin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lin|first1=MG|date=April 2006|title=Umbilical cord prolapse.|journal=Obstetrical &amp; Gynecological Survey|volume=61|issue=4|pages=269–77|doi=10.1097/01.ogx.0000208802.20908.c6|pmid=16551378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obstructed labour=== 
{{Main|Obstructed labour}}
The second stage of labour may be delayed or lengthy due to poor or uncoordinated uterine action, an abnormal uterine position such as [[breech birth|breech]] or [[shoulder dystocia]], and [[cephalopelvic disproportion]] (a small pelvis or large infant).  Prolonged labour may result in maternal exhaustion, fetal distress, and other complications including [[obstetric fistula]].&lt;ref name=WHO2008S2&gt;{{cite book|title=Education material for teachers of midwifery : midwifery education modules|date=2008|publisher=World Health Organisation|location=Geneva [Switzerland]|isbn=9789241546669|pages=38–44|edition=2nd|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241546669_4_eng.pdf?ua=1|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221002801/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241546669_4_eng.pdf?ua=1|archivedate=2015-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Placental abruption===
[[Placental abruption]] is separation of the placenta from the uterus. Treatment of placental abruption during labour is immediate [[birth|delivery]] if the fetus is mature (36 weeks or older), or if a younger fetus or the mother is in distress.

===Premature labour===
{{Main|Preterm birth}}
Premature labour is labour that spontaneously occurs earlier than 37 weeks [[gestational age]].

=== Nuchal cord ===
A [[nuchal cord]] is a rare complication that occurs when the [[umbilical cord]] becomes wrapped around the [[Fetus|fetal]] neck. If present during labour, treatment is delivery by [[Caesarean section|C-section]].

===Perinatal asphyxia===
{{Main|Perinatal asphyxia}}

[[Perinatal asphyxia]] is the medical condition resulting from [[Hypoxia (medical)|deprivation of oxygen]] to during labour. Hypoxic damage can occur to most of the infant's organs ([[heart]], [[lung]]s, [[liver]], [[Gut (zoology)|gut]], [[kidneys]]), but [[brain damage]] is of most concern and perhaps the least likely to quickly or completely heal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00431-007-0437-8 |title=Long-term cognitive and behavioral consequences of neonatal encephalopathy following perinatal asphyxia: A review |year=2007 |last1=Handel |first1=M. |last2=Swaab |first2=H. |last3=De Vries |first3=L.S. |last4=Jongmans |first4=M.J. |journal=European Journal of Pediatrics |volume=166 |issue=7 |pages=645–54 |pmid=17426984 |pmc=1914268 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment is immediate delivery (C-section). Causes of perinatal asphyxia include [[umbilical cord prolapse]], [[nuchal cord]], and [[obstructed labour]].

===Mechanical fetal injury===
Risk factors for fetal birth injury include [[fetal macrosomia]] (big baby), [[maternal obesity]], the need for instrumental delivery, and an inexperienced attendant. Specific situations that can contribute to birth injury include breech presentation and [[shoulder dystocia]]. Most fetal birth injuries resolve without long term harm, but [[brachial plexus injury]] may lead to [[Erb's palsy]] or [[Klumpke's paralysis]].&lt;ref name="GraysAnatomy35th1046"&gt;{{cite book| title=[[Gray's Anatomy]] | editor1-last=Warwick |editor1-first= R. |editor2-last= Williams |editor2-first= P.L. | edition=35th British| publisher= Longman |location=London|year=1973 |page=1046 |isbn=978-0-443-01011-8 &lt;!-- isbn for publication in Philadelphia by Saunders same edition, page not verified --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uterine rupture===
[[Uterine rupture]] is a serious event during [[childbirth]] by which the integrity of the [[Myometrium|myometrial]] wall is breached. In an incomplete rupture the [[peritoneum]] is still intact. With a complete rupture the contents of the uterus may spill into the peritoneal cavity or the [[broad ligament]]. A uterine rupture is a life-threatening event for mother and baby as it typically results in [[Obstetrical bleeding|severe hemorrhage]] and can cause [[Perinatal asphyxia|perninatal asphyxia]].

In medicine, '''Piskacek's sign''' is an indication of [[pregnancy]]. This sign, however, may or may not be a concrete probability of pregnancy along with other signs of early pregnancy. Other signs of early pregnancy include [[Goodell's sign|Goodell]], [[Hegar's sign|Hegar]], [[von Braun-Fernwald's sign|von Braun Fernwald]], and [[Chadwick's sign|Chadwick]]. 

Specifically, Piskacek's sign consists noting a palpable lateral bulge or soft prominence one of the locations where the uterine tube meets the [[uterus]]. Piskacek's sign can be noted in the seventh to eight week of gestation. Non pregnant uterus is pyriform in shape. By 12 weeks of gestation it becomes globular. In lateral implantation, there is asymmetrical enlargement of the uterus. One half of the uterus where the implantation occurred is firm while the other half is soft. This is known as Piskacek's sign.
The sign is named after [[Ludwig Piskaçek]].

'''Religious abuse''' is [[abuse]] administered under the guise of [[religion]], including [[harassment]] or [[humiliation]], which may result in [[psychological trauma]]. Religious abuse may also include misuse of religion for [[Selfishness|selfish]], [[Secularism|secular]], or [[Ideology|ideological]] ends such as the abuse of a clerical position.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Wright, ''Religious Abuse'', Wood Lake Publishing Inc., 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological abuse==
One specific meaning of the term ''religious abuse'' refers to [[psychological manipulation]] and harm inflicted on a person by using the teachings of their religion. This is perpetrated by members of the same or similar faith, and includes the use of a position of authority within the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiritwatch.org/relabdef.htm |title=What Religious Abuse Is About |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most often directed at children and emotionally vulnerable adults, and motivations behind such abuse vary, but can be either well-intentioned or malicious.&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;{{cite book |author=Wright, Keith T. |title=Religious Abuse: A Pastor Explores the Many Ways Religion Can Hurt As Well As Heal |publisher=Northstone Publishing |location=Kelowna, B.C |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=1-896836-47-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even well-intentioned religious abuse can have long-term psychological consequences, such as the victim developing [[phobia]]s or long-term [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. They may have a sense of shame that persists even after they leave the religion. A person can also be manipulated into avoiding a beneficial action (such as a medical treatment) or to engage in a harmful behavior.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

In his book ''Religious Abuse'', pastor Keith Wright describes an example of such abuse. When he was a child, his [[Christian Scientist]] mother became very ill and eventually was convinced to seek medical treatment at an inpatient facility. Members of her church went to the treatment center to convince her to trust prayer rather than treatment, and to leave. She died shortly thereafter. While the church members may not have had any malicious intent, their use of their religion's teachings to manipulate Wright's mother ultimately resulted in her death.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

==Against children==
Religiously-based psychological abuse of children can involve using teachings to subjugate children through fear, or indoctrinating the child in the beliefs of their particular religion whilst suppressing other perspectives. Psychologist Jill Mytton describes this as crushing the child's chance to form a personal morality and belief system; it makes them utterly reliant on their religion and/or parents, and they never learn to [[Critical thinking|reflect critically]] on information they receive. Similarly, the use of fear and a judgmental environment (such as the concept of [[Hell]]) to control the child can be traumatic.&lt;ref name=Mytton&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXA7GA9yntc |title=YouTube - Jill Mytton Interview - Richard Dawkins |work= |accessdate=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical abuse==
Physical abuse in a religious context often takes the form of beatings, illegal confinement, neglect, near drowning or even murder in the belief that the child is [[Demonic possession|possessed by evil spirits]], practicing sorcery or [[witchcraft]], or has committed some kind of [[sin]] that warrants punishment. Such extreme cases are, though, rare.

In 2012, the United Kingdom's [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] instituted a new action plan to investigate the issue of faith-based abuse after several high-profile murders, such as that Kristy Bamu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/couple-guilty-of-horrific-witchcraft-murder-7468465.html|title=Couple guilty of horrific witchcraft murder|date=1 March 2012|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a term of 10 years, [[Metropolitan Police Service|Scotland Yard]] conducted 83 investigations into allegations of abuse with faith-based elements and feared there were even more that were unreported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = BBC News - Witchcraft-based child abuse: Action plan launched | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-19248144 | publisher =  | accessdate = 15 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious violence==
{{Main|Religious violence}}
Religious violence and extremism (also called communal violence&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, D.L. (2000) The Deadly Ethnic Riot. University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA&lt;/ref&gt;) is a term that covers all phenomena where [[religion]] is either the subject or object of violent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Wellman|first= James|author2=Tokuno, Kyoko |year= 2004|title= Is Religious Violence Inevitable?|publisher=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2004.00234.x|journal= Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume= 43|pages= 291|issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human sacrifice===
{{Main|Child sacrifice|Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures}}
[[Archaeology]] has uncovered physical evidence of [[child sacrifice]] at several locations.&lt;ref name="Hardness"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hardness of Heart / Hardness of Life: The Stain of Human Infanticide|last=Milner|first=Larry S.|publisher=University Press of America|year=2000}}&lt;!-- pp. 16-22 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the best attested examples are the diverse rites which were part of the religious practices in [[Mesoamerica]] and the [[Inca Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Reinhard  | first = Johan  |author2=Maria Stenzel  | title = A 6,700 metros niños incas sacrificados quedaron congelados en el tiempo  | journal=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]  | pages = 36–55  |date=November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exn.ca/mummies/story.asp?id=1999041452|title=Watch video online|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = de Sahagún  | first = Bernardino | authorlink = Bernardino de Sahagún  | title = [[Florentine Codex|''Florentine Codex: History of the Things of New Spain'']], 12 books and 2 introductory volumes  | publisher = University of Utah Press, translated and edited by Arthur J.O.

[[Plutarch]] (c.46–120 AD) mentions the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]]'s ritual burning of small children, as do [[Tertullian]], [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Philo]]. [[Livy]] and [[Polybius]] do not. The [[Hebrew Bible]] also mentions what appears to be child sacrifice practised at a place called the [[Tophet]] (''roasting place'') by the [[Canaan]]ites, and by some Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Brown  | first = Shelby  | title = Late Carthaginian Child Sacrifice and Sacrificial Monuments in their Mediterranean Context  | publisher = Sheffield Academic Press  | year = 1991  | location = Sheffield   | pages =  | url =  | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children were thrown to the sharks in ancient [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Davies  | first = Nigel  | title = Human Sacrifice in History and Today  | publisher = William Morrow &amp; Co.  | year = 1981  | location = NY  | pages = 192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacrificial victims were often infants. "The slaughtering of newborn babies may be considered a common event in many cultures" including the [[Eskimo]], the [[Polynesians]], the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians, the [[Chinese people|Chinese]], the [[Scandinavia]]ns, and various indigenous peoples of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|Africa]], [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|the Americas]] and [[Indigenous Australians|Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Grotstein | first = James S. | authorlink =  | title = Who is the dreamer who dreams the dream?| publisher = The Analytic Press, Relational Perspectives Book Series Volume 19 edition | year = 2000  | location = NJ| pages = 247, 242  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initiation rites===
{{Main|Initiation rite}}
[[Artificial deformation of the skull]] predates written history and dates back as far as 45,000 BCE, as evidenced by two [[Neanderthal]] skulls found in [[Shanidar Cave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Trinkaus |first= Erik |date=April 1982|title= Artificial Cranial Deformation in the Shanidar 1 and 5 Neandertals|journal= Current Anthropology |volume= 23|issue= 2|pages= 198–199 |jstor= 2742361|doi= 10.1086/202808 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was usually started just after birth and continued until the desired shape was achieved. It may have played a key role in Egyptian and [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Rousselle  | first = Aline  | title = Porneia: On Desire and the Body in Antiquity  | publisher = Basil Blackwell  | year = 1983  | location = Oxford  | pages = 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[China]] some boys were castrated, with both the penis and scrotum cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Tompkins| first = Peter| title = The Eunuch and the Virgin: A Study of Curious Customs | publisher = Bramhall House | year = 1963  | location = NY| pages = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Ritual#Ritual actions|ritual actions]] have been described by [[anthropologists]]. [[Géza Róheim]] wrote about initiation rituals performed by Australian natives in which adolescent initiates were forced to drink [[blood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Róheim  | first = Géza | authorlink =  Géza Róheim | title =  Psychoanalysis and Anthropology | publisher =  International Universities Press| year =  1950| location =  NY| pages =  76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritual [[rape]] of young [[virgin]]s have been part of [[shaman]]istic practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =  Nevill | first =  Drury | authorlink =  | title =  The Elements of Shamanism | publisher =  Element| year =  1989| location =  Longmead| pages =  20| url =  | doi =    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern practices===

===Psychohistorical explanation===
{{Main|Psychohistorical views on infanticide}}

A small number of academics subscribe to the theory of [[psychohistory]] and attribute the abusive rituals to the [[psychopathology|psychopathological]] [[projection (psychology)|projection]] of the perpetrators, especially the parents.&lt;ref name="EMOL"/&gt;&lt;!-- pp. 258-262 --&gt;&lt;ref name="OneCosmos"/&gt;&lt;!-- pp. 124-176 --&gt;

This ''psychohistorical'' model claims that practices of [[Tribal society|tribal societies]] sometimes included [[incest]] and the sacrifice, [[mutilation]], rape and [[torture]] of children, and that such activities were culturally acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=deMause |first=Lloyd  |authorlink=Lloyd deMause|title=Foundations of Psychohistory |url= |edition= |series= |date= January 1982  |publisher=Creative Roots Publishing  |location= |isbn=0-940508-01-X |oclc= |doi=  |pages=132–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Rascovsky  | first = A.  | title = Filicide: The Murder, Humiliation, Mutilation, Denigration and Abandonment of Children by Parents  | publisher = [[Jason Aronson|Aronson]]  | year = 1995  | location = NJ  | pages = 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual abuse==
Spiritual abuse includes:
* [[Psychological abuse]] and [[emotional abuse]]
* [[Physical abuse]] including physical injury and deprivation of sustenance.
* [[Sexual abuse]]
* Any act by deeds or words that [[shame]] or diminish the [[dignity]] of a person.
* [[Intimidation]] and the requirement to [[Submission|submit]] to a spiritual authority without any right to dissent.
* Unreasonable control of a person's basic right to exercise [[freewill]] in spiritual or natural matters.
* [[False accusation]]s and repeated [[criticism]] by labeling a person as, for example, disobedient, rebellious, lacking faith, [[demonization|demonized]], [[apostate]], an enemy of the church or of a deity.
* [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|Isolationism]], separation, [[disenfranchisement]] or estrangement from family and friends outside the group due to cult-religious or spiritual or indigenous beliefs.
* [[Esotericism]], hidden agendas and requirements revealed to members only as they successfully advance through various stages of a faith.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Steven Lambert, ''Charismatic Captivation, Authoritarian Abuse &amp; Psychological Enslavement in Neo-Pentecostal Churches'' (Real Truth Publications, 1996); adapted article available online: "Signs of Spiritual Abuse" [http://www.charismatic-captivation.com/?p=5]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Enforced practice of [[spiritualism]], [[mysticism]], or other ideologies peculiar to members of that religion.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, ''Charismatic Captivation; adapted article available online: "Signs of Spiritual Abuse" [http://www.charismatic-captivation.com/?p=5]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Financial exploitation or [[enslavement]] of adherents.&lt;ref name="Lambert5"&gt;Lambert, ''Charismatic Captivation''; adapted article available online: "Signs of Spiritual Abuse" [http://www.charismatic-captivation.com/?p=5]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
The term ''spiritual abuse'' was purportedly coined in the late twentieth century to refer to alleged abuse of authority by church leaders,&lt;ref&gt;Jeff VanVonderen: "Spiritual abuse occurs when someone in a position of spiritual authority, the purpose of which is to 'come underneath' and serve, build, equip and make a deity's or a god's people MORE free, misuses that authority placing themselves over a god's people to control, coerce or manipulate them for seemingly godly purposes which are really their own."[http://www.spiritualabuse.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; albeit some scholars and historians would dispute that claim, citing prior literary appearances of the term in literature on religion and psychology. Lambert defines spiritual abuse as "a type of psychological predomination that could be rightly termed—''religious enslavement''."&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, ''Charismatic Captivation''; p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; He further identifies "religious enslavement" as being a product of what is termed in the [[Bible]] "[[witchcraft]]," or "[[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]]."&lt;ref&gt;2 Chronicles 33:6; Galatians 5:20; Revelation 18:23; et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
[[Ronald Enroth]] in ''[[Churches That Abuse]]'' identifies five categories:{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

# '''Authority and Power''': abuse arises when leaders of a group arrogate to themselves power and authority that lacks the dynamics of open accountability and the capacity to question or challenge decisions made by leaders. The shift entails moving from general respect for an office bearer to one where members loyally submit without any right to dissent.
# '''[[Psychological manipulation|Manipulation]] and Control''': abusive groups are characterized by social dynamics where [[fear]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] or [[threats]] are routinely used to produce unquestioning obedience, group conformity or stringent tests of [[loyalty]]. The leader-disciple relationship may become one in which the leader's decisions control and usurp the disciple's right or capacity to make choices.
# '''[[Elitism]] and Persecution''': abusive groups depict themselves as unique and have a strong organizational tendency to be separate from other bodies and institutions. The social dynamism of the group involves being independent or separate, with diminishing possibilities for internal correction or reflection, whilst outside criticism.
# '''Life-style and Experience''': abusive groups foster rigidity in behavior and belief that requires conformity to the group's ideals.
# '''Dissent and Discipline''': abusive groups tend to suppress any kind of internal challenge to decisions made by leaders.

Agnes and John Lawless argue in ''The Drift into Deception'' that there are eight characteristics of spiritual abuse, and some of these clearly overlap with Enroth's criteria. They list the eight marks of spiritual abuse as comprising: {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
#[[Charisma]] and [[pride]]
#[[Anger]] and [[intimidation]]
#[[Seven deadly sins#Greed|Greed]] and [[fraud]]
#[[Immorality]]
#Enslaving [[authoritarian]] structure
#Exclusivity
#Demanding [[loyalty]] and honor
#New revelation

The author of ''Charismatic Captivation''&lt;ref&gt;Charismatic Captivation, by Steven Lambert&lt;/ref&gt; in a post on the book's website delineates "33 Signs of Spiritual Abuse",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charismatic-captivation.com/?p=5|title=The Signs of Spiritual Abuse|date=15 November 2008|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; including:

#Apotheosis or de facto deification of the leadership.
#Absolute authority of the leadership.
#Pervasive abuse and misuse of authority in personal dealings with members to coerce submission.
#Paranoia, inordinate egotism or narcissism, and insecurity by the leaders.
#Abuse and inordinate incidence of "church discipline" particularly in matters not expressly considered to be church discipline issues.
#Inordinate attention to maintaining the public image of the ministry and lambasting of all "critics".
#Constant indoctrination with a "group" or "family" mentality that impels members to exalt the corporate "life" and goals of the church-group over their personal goals, callings, objectives or relationships.
#Members are psychologically traumatized, terrorized and indoctrinated with numerous fears aimed at creating an over-dependence or codependence on their leaders and the corporate group.
#Members may be required to obtain the approval (or ''witness'') of their leader(s) for decisions regarding personal matters.
#Frequent preaching from the pulpit discouraging leaving the religion or disobeying the leaderships' dictates.
#Members departing without the blessing of the leadership do so under a cloud of suspicion, shame, or slander.
#Departing members often suffer from psychological problems and display the symptoms associated with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).

===Research and examples===
Flavil Yeakley's team of researchers conducted field-tests with members of the [[Boston Church of Christ]] using the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]]. In ''The Discipling Dilemma'' Yeakley reports that the members tested "showed a high level of change in psychological type scores", with a "clear pattern of convergence in a single type".&lt;ref name="Yeakley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yeakley|first1=Flavil|title=The Discipling Dilemma|date=1988|publisher=Gospel Advocate Company|location=Nashville|isbn=0-89225-311-8|page=39|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same tests were conducted on five mainline [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s and with six groups that are popularly labeled as [[cult]]s or manipulative [[sect]]s. Yeakley's test results showed that the pattern in the Boston Church "was not found among other churches of Christ or among members of five mainline denominations, but that it was found in studies of six manipulative sects."&lt;ref name="Yeakley"/&gt; The research did ''not'' show that the Boston Church was "attracting people with a psychological need for high levels of control", but Yeakley concluded that "they are producing conformity in psychological type" which he deemed to be "unnatural, unhealthy and dangerous."&lt;ref&gt;Yeakley p44, p46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not a [[longitudinal study]] and relied on asking participants to answer the survey three times; once as they imagined they might answer five years prior, once as their present selves and once as they imagined they might answer after five years of influence in the sect. The author insists that despite this, "any significant changes in the pattern of these perceptions would indicate some kind of group pressure. A high degree of change and a convergence in a single type would be convincing proof that the Boston Church of Christ has some kind of group dynamic operating that tends to produce conformity to the group norm." However it could instead indicate a desire on the part of the respondents to change in the direction indicated. To determine actual changes in MBTI results would require a longitudinal study, since the methodology here was inherently suggestive of its conclusion. This is also amply borne out in its instructions: "The instructions stated clearly that no one was telling them that their answers ought to change. The instructions said that the purpose of the study was simply to find out if there were any changes and, if so, what those changes might indicate."&lt;ref&gt;Yeakley p.30-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Rohat Aktaş''' (ca. 1997 – February 24, 2016) a [[Turkey|Turkish]]-[[Kurdistan|Kurdish]] journalist and news editor for ''[[Azadiya Welat]]'' in the southeastern Turkish town [[Cizre]], [[Şırnak Province]], [[Turkey]],  was shot on January 22, disappeared on January 30, 2016, and discovered later dead. At the time, he was reporting about the armed confrontation between Kurdish separatists and Turkish forces, which is part of the [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)]].&lt;ref name=cpj&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cpj.org/killed/2016/rohat-aktas.php|title=Rohat Aktaş – Journalists Killed |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Rohat's mother spoke with JINHA and gave an insight to Rohat's life and character. Rohat was born in [[Istanbul]] in 1997. When Rohat was three years old, the [[1999 İzmit earthquake]] destroyed his home forcing his family to move back to their hometown, [[Suruç]].  In 2006, the ''[[Azadiya Welat]]'' began daily publication and Rohat met with Kurdish free press and began to distribute their papers.  Years later he became chief and editor for the newspaper.  His mother told interviewers that he did not like cruelty or oppression of different groups, it did not seem moral and scared him.&lt;ref name=jinha&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jinha.com.tr/en/ALL-NEWS/content/view/45089|title=JINHA -- www.jinha.com.tr|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Aktaş was working as a news editor for the ''Azadiya Welat'' in the southeastern Turkish town, Cizre.&lt;ref name=nrttv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrttv.com/en/Details.aspx?Jimare=5547|title=Kurdish Journalist Killed in Southeast Turkey|publisher=NRT TV News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aktaş was covering the protests, riots and military conflict in Cizre, it was one of the several areas where security forces were very heavily present.&lt;ref name=cpj/&gt;&lt;ref name=nrttv/&gt; There were many groups of militants fighting for the banned [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] or formerly known as [[PKK]] and this was causing the area to be extremely tense.  Kurdish groups were claiming that many people had been burned in the same basement in Cizre.  There was a 24-hour curfew installed for the town because of the danger that was present.&lt;ref name=cpj/&gt;

He was able to make contact with his family two days after he had sustained the injury and told them about this situation.&lt;ref name=dw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/turkish-forces-accused-of-mass-murder-in-southeast/a-19044651|title=Turkish forces accused of 'mass murder' in southeast - Europe - DW.COM - 12.02.2016|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Azadiya Welat'' newsroom was in contact with Aktas but lost communication with him.  On February 4, the newsroom had been without communication from Rohat Aktas for five days.  They reported the last conversation they had with Rohat he told them "The state wants to execute us"&lt;ref name="jinha"/&gt;
It was not until February 24 that Aktas's body had been identified using DNA testing to confirm his death.  Aktas was among 8 others who were killed in the incident and found in the basement as well, 10-15 others were also wounded. Police have confirmed that more than 40 others have also died in the streets as a result of the violence.&lt;ref name=cpj/&gt;&lt;ref name=diclehaber&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diclehaber.com/en/news/content/view/501793?from=4204245554|title=Journalist Rohat Aktaş, 8 other people's bodies identified|publisher=diclehaber.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the shooting occurred, some changes started showing up on Rohat Aktaş's Twitter account.  His profile picture showed him sitting down with a rifle over his shoulder and chest. Aktaş's agency reported that he was not a fighter and was on an assignment to cover the fights in Cizre.  Other allegations of Aktas being a fighter have surfaced, but none have been proven to be true. The newspaper Rohat was working for, "Azadiya Wela" has confirmed that he was in Cizre to cover the clashes for a story.  Since his death, Rohat Aktaş's Twitter account has been suspended.&lt;ref name=cpj/&gt;

==Context==
This was part of the Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present). Kurdish nationalism aspires to separate from Turkey and create an independent area known as [[Kurdistan]] and is connected in purpose with other movements in bordering countries. In Cizre, these protests and riots became violent.&lt;ref name=kurdishinfo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurdishinfo.com/editor-of-kurdish-daily-among-10-wounded-in-cizre|title=Editor of Kurdish daily among 10 wounded in Cizre – Kurdish Info|date=23 January 2016|publisher=kurdishinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The violent outbreaks and treatment of citizens have sparked investigations revolving around the [[Human Rights in Turkey]].&lt;ref name=ohchr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=17231&amp;LangID=E|title=Human Rights Council holds general debate on human rights situations that require the Council's attention|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his wound, Rohat Aktas was reporting about the confrontation between Kurdish separatists and Turkish forces in Cizre. Another unnamed journalist was also injured in the same events that led to Aktas's death.&lt;ref name=diclehaber/&gt;

Along with Aktas, 115 dead bodies have been removed from basements in the town of Cizre that came under attack by Turkish state forces.  The government says more than 300 members of the security forces have died fighting Kurdish rebels since July.  The curfew was not lifted on the town of Cizre for a few weeks after the situation arose because of leftover explosives the military was still working to clear and clean up.  Locals of Cizre have spoke since the incident and said that the worst of the violence is over, but they are uncertain whether peace has been achieved yet.&lt;ref name=theguardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/02/turkey-kurdish-people-cizre-return-to-ruins|title=Turkey eases curfew after assault on PKK rebels leaves Cizre in ruins|first=Associated|last=Press|date=2 March 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/residents-return-to-cizre-after-curfew-to-find-town-destroyed-20160303-gn9ca4.html|title=Imagine returning home after a curfew and finding it destroyed|first=Dominigue|last=Soguel|date=3 March 2016|publisher=smh.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ibtimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/turkey-dozens-burned-death-basement-by-government-attack-say-kurdish-activists-1542623|title=Turkey: Dozens 'burned to death' in basement by government attack, say Kurdish activists|first=Umberto|last=Bacchi|date=8 February 2016|publisher=ibtimes.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
[[Irina Bokova]], director-general of [[UNESCO]], said, "I condemn the killing of Rohat Aktaş. It is essential for freedom of expression and freedom of information that journalists be able to carry out their work without fear of death or violence."&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/all-news/news/director_general_condemns_killing_of_reporter_rohat_aktas_i/|title=Director-General condemns killing of reporter Rohat Aktaş in Turkey-United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement from [[PEN International]] stated: "Rohat Aktaş died while trying to tell the world about the plight of wounded civilians with little or no access to medical care in Cizre. Freedom of expression plays an invaluable role, particularly in times of conflict, to allow us to understand what is happening. We call on the Turkish authorities to conduct a swift, transparent and thorough investigation into the death of Rohat Aktaş and urge the government in Ankara to look for a peaceful and diplomatic solution to the conflict in southeast Turkey."&lt;ref name=pen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pen-international.org/newsitems/turkey-death-of-editor-journalist-rohat-aktas-in-cizre-must-be-investigate/|title=Death of editor &amp; journalist Rohat Aktaş in Cizre must be investigated |publisher=PEN International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Press Emblem Campaign was very worried about the deterioration of the freedom of the press in Turkey. Turkey was called upon to reverse its decision to seize the Zaman daily.  A full and swift investigation was needed into the murder of Rohat Aktas, the editor and journalist of a Kurdish-language daily.  The event of Aktas's death has called into question the [[Human Rights in Turkey]].&lt;ref name=ohchr /&gt;

[[International Association of Democratic Lawyers]] have coordinated with Centre Europe question the Human Rights council concerning the conditions of human rights in [[Turkey]].  Journalist have been detained on false charges of terrorism, peaceful protests were the police responded with tear gas, and the wounded were denied medical treatment.  Human rights are constantly ignored and disrespected in [[Turkey]] and political groups are starting to take action.&lt;ref name=ohchr /&gt;

'''''Seven''''' (stylized as '''''SE7EN''''') is a 1995 American [[neo-noir]] [[crime thriller|crime thriller film]] directed by [[David Fincher]] and written by [[Andrew Kevin Walker]]. It stars [[Brad Pitt]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[John C. McGinley]], [[R. Lee Ermey]], and [[Kevin Spacey]]. It tells the story of David Mills (Pitt), a detective who partners with the retiring William Somerset (Freeman) to track down a [[serial killer]] (Spacey) who uses the [[seven deadly sins]] as a motif in his murders.

The screenplay was influenced by the time Walker spent in [[New York City]] trying to make it as a writer. Principal photography took place in [[Los Angeles]], with the last scene filmed near [[Lancaster, California]]. The film's budget was $33 million.

Released on September 22, 1995, by [[New Line Cinema]], ''Seven'' was the seventh-highest-grossing film of the year, grossing over $327 million worldwide.&lt;ref name=BOM/&gt; It was well received by critics, who praised the film's darkness, brutality and themes. The film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the [[68th Academy Awards]], but lost to ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]''.

==Plot==
Soon-to-retire detective William Somerset is partnered with short-tempered but idealistic David Mills, who has recently moved to the city with his wife Tracy. Tracy confides to Somerset that she is pregnant and has yet to tell Mills, as she is unhappy with the city and feels it is no place to raise a child. Somerset sympathizes, having had a similar situation with his ex-girlfriend many years earlier, and advises her to tell Mills only if she plans to keep the child.

Somerset and Mills investigate a set of murders inspired by the [[seven deadly sins]]: a man forced to eat until his stomach ruptured, representing [[gluttony]], and a defense attorney killed after [[a pound of flesh]] was taken from him, representing [[greed]]. Clues at the murder scenes lead them to a suspect's apartment, where they find a third victim, a drug dealer and [[Child molestation|child molester]], strapped to a bed, emaciated but alive, representing [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]]. Daily photographs of the victim, taken over a year, show the crimes were planned far in advance.

The detectives use library records to identify a [[John Doe]] and track him to his apartment. Doe flees and Mills gives chase. Doe turns to hold Mills at gunpoint for a moment before escaping. The apartment contains hundreds of notebooks revealing Doe's psychopathy, as well as a clue to another murder. The detectives arrive too late to stop a man forced to kill a prostitute by raping her with a custom-made, bladed [[Strap-on dildo|strap-on,]] representing [[lust]]. The following day, they attend the scene of a fifth murder, a model whose face has been mutilated by Doe; she was given the option to call for help and live disfigured, or commit suicide by taking pills, representing [[pride]].

As Somerset and Mills return to the police station, Doe turns himself in, covered in the blood of an unidentified victim. Doe offers to take the detectives to the final two victims and confess to the murders, but only under specific terms, or he will [[Insanity defense|plead insanity]]. Somerset is wary, but Mills agrees.

The detectives follow Doe's directions to a remote desert location. Within minutes, a delivery van approaches. Mills holds Doe at gunpoint while Somerset intercepts the driver, who has been instructed to bring a box to them. Doe begins to taunt Mills by telling him how envious he was of his life with Tracy. Somerset opens the box and, in a sudden panic, warns Mills to stay back. Doe then says that his sin was [[envy]], and that Tracy died as a result of this; he also states that her head is in the box, and that she was pregnant. Despite Somerset's warnings, Mills shoots Doe, representing [[wrath]], and completing Doe's plan. Police converge and take the devastated Mills away.

==Production==
===Pre-production===
The primary influence for the film's screenplay came from [[Andrew Kevin Walker]]'s time spent in [[New York City]] while trying to make it as a screenwriter. "I didn't like my time in New York, but it's true that if I hadn't lived there I probably wouldn't have written ''Seven''."&lt;ref name="Montesano"&gt;{{cite news |last=Montesano |first=Anthony |title=''Seven''{{'s}} Deadly Sins |work=[[Cinefantastique]] |page=48 | date=February  1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He envisioned actor [[William Hurt]] as Somerset and named the character after his favorite author, [[W. Somerset Maugham]].&lt;ref name="Montesano"/&gt;

[[Jeremiah S. Chechik]] was attached to direct at one point.&lt;ref name="Montesano"/&gt; During pre-production, [[Al Pacino]] was considered for the Somerset role, but he decided to do ''[[City Hall (film)|City Hall]]''. [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Sylvester Stallone]] turned down the role of Mills.  Washington later regretted turning down the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doty|first=Meriah|title=Denzel Washington regrets passing up ‘Seven’ and ‘Michael Clayton’|date=September 18, 2012|publisher=[[Yahoo! Movies]]|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/blogs/movie-talk/denzel-washington-regrets-passing-seven-michael-clayton-202631871.html|accessdate=May 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Edward|title=Denzel Washington Turned Down ‘Seven’ &amp; ‘Michael Clayton,’ Javier Bardem Passed On ‘Minority Report’|date=September 26, 2012|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2012/09/denzel-washington-turned-down-seven-michael-clayton-javier-bardem-passed-on-minority-report-105570/|accessdate=May 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ending of the screenplay, with the head in the box, was originally part of an earlier draft that New Line had rejected, instead opting for an ending that involved more traditional elements of a detective thriller film with more action-oriented elements. But when New Line sent David Fincher the screenplay to review for his interest in the project, they accidentally sent him the original screenplay with the head-in-the-box ending. At the time, Fincher had not read a script for a year and a half since the frustrating experience of making ''[[Alien 3]]''; he said, "I thought I'd rather die of [[colon cancer]] than do another movie".&lt;ref name="Taubin"&gt;{{cite news |last=Taubin |first=Amy |title=The Allure of Decay |work=[[Sight and Sound]] |page=24 |date=January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fincher eventually agreed to direct ''Seven'' because he was drawn to the script, which he found to be a "connect-the-dots movie that delivers about inhumanity. It's psychologically violent. It implies so much, not about why you did but how you did it".&lt;ref name="Taubin"/&gt; He found it more a "meditation on evil" rather than a "police procedural".

When New Line realized that they had sent Fincher the wrong draft, the President of Production, [[Michael De Luca]], met with Fincher and noted that there was internal pressure to retain the revised version; De Luca stated that if Fincher promised to produce the movie, they would be able to stay with the head-in-a-box ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/03/david-fincher-interview-transcript | title = David Fincher | first = Mark | last = Salsibury | date = January 18, 2009 | accessdate= June 26, 2012 | work = [[The Guardian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, producer Kopelson refused to allow the film to include the head-in-a-box scene.&lt;ref name="ending mottham"/&gt; Actor Pitt joined Fincher in arguing for keeping this original scene, noting that his previous film ''[[Legends of the Fall]]'' had its emotional ending cut after negative feedback from test audiences, and refusing to do ''Seven'' unless the head-in-the-box scene remained.&lt;ref name="pitt ending ew"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/09/16/brad-pitt-gwyneth-head-se7en/ | title = How Brad Pitt fought to keep Gwyneth's head in the box in 'Se7en' | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = September 16, 2011 | accessdate= June 26, 2012 | first = Grady | last = Smith }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Fincher approached making ''Seven'' like a "tiny [[Genre film|genre movie]], the kind of movie [[William Friedkin|Friedkin]] might have made after ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''." He worked with cinematographer [[Darius Khondji]] and adopted a simple approach to the camerawork, which was influenced by the television show ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'', "how the camera is in the backseat peering over people's shoulder".&lt;ref name="Taubin"/&gt; Fincher allowed Walker on the set while filming for on-the-set rewrites.&lt;ref name="Montesano"/&gt; According to the director, "''Seven'' is the first time I got to carry through certain things about the camera&amp;nbsp;– and about what movies are or can be".&lt;ref name="Taubin"/&gt;

The crowded urban streets filled with noisy denizens and an oppressive rain that seems to fall without respite were integral parts of the film, as Fincher wanted to show a city that was "dirty, violent, polluted, often depressing. Visually and stylistically, that's how we wanted to portray this world. Everything needed to be as authentic and raw as possible." To this end, Fincher turned to production designer [[Arthur Max]] to create a dismal world that often eerily mirrors its inhabitants. "We created a setting that reflects the moral decay of the people in it", says Max. "Everything is falling apart, and nothing is working properly." The film's brooding, dark look was achieved through a chemical process called [[bleach bypass]], wherein the silver in the film stock was not removed, which in turn deepened the dark, shadowy images in the film and increased its overall tonal quality.

The 'head in a box' ending continued to worry the studio after filming was completed. After the first cut of the film was shown to the studio, they attempted to mitigate the bleakness of the ending by replacing Mills' wife's head with that of a dog, or by not having Mills fire on John Doe. However, both Fincher and Pitt continued to fight for the original ending.&lt;ref name="pitt ending ew"/&gt; The final scenes of Mills being taken away and Somerset's quote from Ernest Hemingway were filmed by Fincher after initial filming was complete as a way to placate the studio (the original intention was for the film to suddenly end after Mills shot John Doe).&lt;ref name="ending mottham"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Sundance Kids: How the Mavericks Took Back Hollywood | first = James | last = Mottham | year = 2007 | publisher = [[Faber and Faber]] | isbn =  0865479674 | pages =  153–155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title sequence===
Originally, Fincher planned the [[title sequence]] of the film to show Freeman's character buying a house in a remote country area and traveling back into the city. However, days before a [[test screening]], they had yet to film the sequence and had no budget to do it in that time. Fincher approached [[Kyle Cooper]] to suggest a replacement. Cooper recognized the amount of money used to make John Doe's notebooks (created by Clive Piercy and John Sabel),&lt;ref name="artofthetitle2"/&gt; and used the sequence to display them in a slideshow set to [[Nine Inch Nails]]' "[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]". The hand-drawn credits font was used to suggest that Doe had written the credits himself.&lt;ref name="empire title"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/david-fincher-fight-club-opening-credits/ | title = Anatomy Of An Opening Sequence: David Fincher's Seven | first = Phil | last = de Semlyen | date = October 9, 2015 | accessdate = April 9, 2018 | work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The studio liked the sequence and suggested he stay with that. Fincher instead asked Cooper to "pretend we've never met and come back and propose something else", according to Cooper.&lt;ref name="empire title"/&gt; Cooper came up with a more detailed version of this photographic sequence: "The idea was that this is John Doe's job: he gets up, makes his books, plans his murders, drinks his tea."&lt;ref name="empire title"/&gt; Fincher liked this approach, but cautioned Cooper "Well, that would be neat, but that's kind of a 2D glimpse. Figure out a way for it to involve John Doe, to show that somewhere across town somebody is working on some really evil shit. I don't want it to be just flipping through pages, as beautiful as they are."&lt;ref name="artofthetitle"&gt;{{cite web|last=Perkins|first=Will|title=David Fincher: A Film Title Retrospective|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/feature/david-fincher-a-film-title-retrospective/|work=[[Art of the Title]]|accessdate=September 8, 2012|date=August 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper reworked the idea, working with Wayne Coe to create a storyboard for a live-action shot&lt;ref name="artofthetitle2"/&gt; and adding in filming along with photographs of the books, new props include film reels and additional notebooks, visual effects for the title credits, and elements inspired by Doe's behavior in the movie, such as cutting his fingertips.&lt;ref name="empire title"/&gt; Fincher liked this approach, and considered getting [[Mark Romanek]], the director of the "Closer" music video to produce the sequence, but Cooper insisted he direct it. Cooper was assisted by film editor [[Angus Wall]] and cinematographer [[Harris Savides]] in making the final title sequence.&lt;ref name="artofthetitle"/&gt; The filming took two days and five further weeks to edit.&lt;ref name="empire title"/&gt; The credits were hand-etched onto black [[scratchboard]] and manipulated by the camera, rather than using digital effects.&lt;ref name="artofthetitle2"/&gt; The final sequence used a remix of "Closer" created by the band [[Coil (band)|Coil]].&lt;ref name="artofthetitle2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/se7en/ | title = Se7en (1995) | first = Ben | last = Radatz | date = July 10, 2012 |  accessdate = April 9, 2018 | work = [[Art of the Title]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Box office===
''Seven'' was released on September 22, 1995, in 2,441 theaters where it grossed US$13.9&amp;nbsp;million on its opening weekend. It went on to gross $100.1&amp;nbsp;million in North America and $227.1&amp;nbsp;million in the rest of the world for a total of $327.3&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name= "boxoffice"&gt;{{cite news |title=Seven |publisher=Box Office Mojo |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=seven.htm |accessdate=March 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; making ''Seven'' the seventh-highest-grossing film in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;The top six grossing films of 1995 were ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'', ''[[Toy Story]]'', ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', ''[[GoldenEye]]'', ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' and ''[[Batman Forever]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
The film also spent 4 consecutive weeks in the top spot at the U.S. box office in 1995.

===Critical response===
The film was well received by critics and holds an 80% positive rating at the film-review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 71 critics with an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 7.8/10. Its consensus reads: "A brutal, relentlessly grimy shocker with taut performances, slick gore effects, and a haunting finale."&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{cite web|title=Seven|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/seven/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has a rating of 65 on Metacritic based on 22 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|title=Seven|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/se7en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary Arnold, in ''[[The Washington Times]]'', praised the cast: "The film's ace in the hole is the personal appeal generated by Mr. Freeman as the mature, cerebral cop and Mr. Pitt as the young, headstrong cop. Not that the contrast is inspired or believable in itself.

==Home media==
For the DVD release, ''Seven'' was remastered and presented in the widescreen format, preserving the 2.40:1 aspect ratio of its original theatrical exhibition. Audio options include [[Dolby Digital]] EX 5.1, [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] ES Discrete 6.1, and Stereo Surround Sound.

The ''Seven'' DVD features four newly recorded, feature-length [[audio commentary|audio commentaries]] featuring the stars and other key contributors to the film, who talk about their experiences making ''Seven''.

This DVD is also compatible with [[DVD-ROM]] drives. Disc One features a printable screenplay with links to the film. The [[Blu-ray Disc]] was released September 14, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Creepy |first=Uncle |title=First Blu-ray News: Seven |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37569/first-blu-ray-news-seven |publisher=dreadcentral.com |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Novelization and comic books==
In 1995, a [[novelization]] with the same title was written by Anthony Bruno based on the original film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruno |first=Anthony |title=Seven: a novel by Anthony Bruno based on a screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker |year=1995 |publisher=New York: St. Martin's Paperbacks |isbn=0-312-95704-1 |page=248 |url=http://www.chipublib.org/search/details/cn/1246748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between September 2006 and October 2007, a series of seven comic books were published by [[Zenescope Entertainment]] with each of the seven issues dedicated to one of the seven sins. It told the story from the perspective of John Doe rather than the two homicide detectives as in the film, and gave Doe a backstory. Each issue included contributions by a group of creators independent of each other. All seven issues were collected in trade paperback form, released on January 15, 2008, as ''[[Seven (comic book)|SE7EN]]'', edited by  David Seidman and Ralph Tedesco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;old=1&amp;id=7216 Comic Book Resources.com Horrific sins: ''SE7EN" comes to comics this September]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mycomicshop.com/search?TID=660931 MyComicShop: Seven (2006 Se7en) comic books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The opening credit music is a spliced sample of an uncredited remix of the [[Nine Inch Nails]] song "[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]", available as "Closer (Precursor)", remixed by [[Coil (band)|Coil]], on the "Closer" single. The song during the end credits is [[David Bowie]]'s song "[[The Hearts Filthy Lesson]]", found on his album ''[[Outside (David Bowie album)|Outside]]''. The film's original score is by [[Howard Shore]].

'''''[[Stegosaurus]]''''' is one of the most recognizable types among [[cultural depictions of dinosaurs]].&lt;ref name = "FasWeis04"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Evolution and Extinction of the Dinosaurs (2nd Edition)|year=2005|chapter=Stegosauria:Hot Plates|editor=Fastovsky DE, Weishampel DB|author=Fastovsky DE, Weishampel DB|pages=107–130|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-81172-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been depicted on film, in cartoons, comics, as children's toys, as sculpture, and even was declared the [[List of U.S. state dinosaurs|state dinosaur]] of [[Colorado]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/history/symbemb.htm|title=Archives|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stegosaurus'' is a subject for inclusion in dinosaur [[toy]] and [[scale model]] lines, such as the [[Carnegie collection|Carnegie Collection]].

As late as the 1970s, ''Stegosaurus'', along with other dinosaurs, was depicted in fiction as a slow-moving, dim-witted creature. The "[[dinosaur renaissance]]" changed the prevailing image of dinosaurs as sluggish and [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] and this reevaluation has been reflected in popular media.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, S.G. (2006). [http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/jan06/feature_threedinofaces.html "The Three Faces of Dinosaurs"]. ''Geotimes''. Retrieved October 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
A sketch of a ''Stegosaurus'' (based on a drawing by [[Ray Lydekker]]) forms an important plot point in the opening chapters of ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'' by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]].

In ''[[Tarzan at the Earth's Core]]'', by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], Jason Gridley encounters a ''Stegosaurus'' in [[Pellucidar]], the world within the Earth. The animal jumps from a height and uses its plates as a gliding mechanism to chase and attack him; the real animal could not perform such an act.

[[Evelyn Sibley Lampman]]'s ''[[The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek]]''&lt;ref&gt;1955 reprint, illustrated by Hubert Buel, {{ISBN|978-1-930900-37-0}}, {{OCLC|186951}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a children's book about twins who find a talking ''Stegosaurus'' on their ranch in Oregon. She also wrote a sequel, ''[[The Shy Stegosaurus of Indian Springs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;1962, illustrated by Paul Galdone, ISBN unknown, {{OCLC|522032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main hero and protagonist of [[Steve Cole]]'s ''[[Astrosaurs]]'' series is an anthropomorphic ''Stegosaurus'' named Captain Teggs.

In ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)]]'', the main characters come across a sick ''Stegosaurus'' at the south of ''Isla Nublar''. The animal will later be replaced by a ''Triceratops'' in the movie adaptation.

==Cinema==
In the 1933 monster film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', the first creature that the band of rescuers meet, as they chase the abducted [[Fay Wray]] deep into Skull Island, is a roaring ''Stegosaurus'', which charges. In the 2005 [[Peter Jackson]] [[King Kong (2005 film)|remake]] ''Stegosaurus'' is nowhere to be seen, although in the extended edition the ''[[Triceratops]]''-like fictional ''Ferructus'' takes its place. A hypothetical descendant of ''Stegosaurus'', called ''Atercurisaurus'', appears in the tie-in book ''The World of Kong''.

Walt Disney's 1940 auteur animation feature ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' features a harrowing battle between a ''Stegosaurus'' and a ''[[Tyrannosaurus Rex]]'' during a segment based upon [[The Rite of Spring]], which depicts the history of life on Earth. (However, this conflicts with the scientific fact that the two species did not co-exist at the same time in history.) The infamous scene is echoed by a display at the [[Denver Museum of Nature and Science]] which shows a ''Stegosaurus'' facing off with an ''[[Allosaurus]]''.

Over the years, ''Stegosaurus'' has often been pitted in battle against large carnivorous dinosaurs, on both the big and small screen. It came up against ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'' in ''[[Journey to the Beginning of Time]]'' (1954), in ''[[The Animal World (film)|The Animal World]]'' (1956), in the [[PBS]] mini-series ''[[The Dinosaurs!]]'' (1992), in the documentary ''[[When Dinosaurs Roamed America]]'' (2001), and in ''[[Jurassic Fight Club]]'' (2008) where it also faces ''[[Allosaurus]]''. It faced ''[[Allosaurus]]'' in the first episode of the French animated series ''[[Once Upon a Time... Man]]'' (1978), in the anime series ''Kyouryuu Wakusei'' (''Dinosaur Planet'') (1993–94), in ''Dinosaur Valley Girls'' (1996), in episode two of ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'' (1999), as well as in the special ''[[Allosaurus: a Walking with Dinosaurs' Special|The Ballad of Big Al]]'' (2000), in episode three of the German cartoon series ''Albert Asks What is Life?'' (2002), in ''Mammals vs. Dinos'' (2008), and in ''[[Planet Dinosaur]]'' (2011). It has even been pitted against ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' in Walt Disney's ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940) (which was the first time the defense of the spike tail was seen), in ''[[Planet of Dinosaurs]]'' (1978),  in the cartoon series ''[[Dino Riders]]'' (1988), in the remake of the series ''[[Land of the Lost (1991 TV series)|Land of the Lost]]'' (1991–92), in the anime television series ''[[Dinosaur King]]'' (2007–08), and in the opening scene of ''[[The Land Before Time XIV: Journey of the Brave]]'' (2016).

An ailing ''Stegosaurus'' is encountered by the characters in the novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crichton M|year=1990|title=Jurassic Park |publisher= Alfred A. Knopf|isbn=0-394-58816-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was replaced by a ''Triceratops'' in the film version. Although it makes no actual appearance in the film, the name is used; it is on one of the embryo vials stolen (misspelled as ''Steg'''a'''saurus''). A ''Stegosaurus'' also appeared ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'', as one of the first dinosaurs to be seen, although they were depicted as far larger than the actual animal. They also were seen briefly in ''[[Jurassic Park III]]'' and in ''[[Jurassic World]]''.

''Stegosaurus'' is one of the three dinosaur types whose physical characteristics were combined by the designers at [[Toho]], to create the [[kaiju|Japanese monster]] [[Godzilla]]; the other two dinosaurs were ''Tyrannosaurus'' and ''[[Iguanodon]]''. In the American version of ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' this is remarked upon by a reporter, claiming Godzilla was half-''Stegosaurus'', half-''Tyrannosaurus''.

==Television==
''Stegosaurus'' has also featured in several television series. For example, several ''Stegosaurus'' were featured in the 1989 animated TV Series, ''[[Dink, the Little Dinosaur]]''. A ''Stegosaurus'' has also appeared in one episode of ''[[Doctor Who]]''. More recently, in 2010, a ''Stegosaurus'' appeared in [[List of Primeval episodes#Webisode1|the first Series 4 Prequel Webisode]] of the [[ITV Network|ITV]] series ''[[Primeval (TV series)|Primeval]]''. It was incorrectly shown as having a horn on its head. This is due to the fact that, instead of creating another model for the ''Stegosaurus'' entirely, the special effects team decided to use the same ''[[Embolotherium]]'' model, which they had previously used, earlier on, in the making of [[List of Primeval episodes#Episode22|Episode 3.9]] of ''Primeval''. In the episode "[[Do Shapeshifters Dream of Electric Sheep?]]" of ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', ''Stegosaurus''' [[Stegosaurus#"Second brain"|second brain]] is mentioned as William Bell's design choice for shape-shifters' memory storage unit. ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' has been featured in numerous television documentaries, such as:
* ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]''
* ''[[Jurassic Fight Club]]''
* ''[[When Dinosaurs Roamed America]]''.
* The fourth episode of the 2011 BBC series ''[[Planet Dinosaur]]''

==Cartoons and comics==
''Stegosaurus'' has also often been featured in children's cartoons. The ''[[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers]]'' toyline and related [[The Transformers (TV series)|television series]] features four characters which can transform into stegosaurids: [[Snarl (Transformers)|Snarl]], Slugfest, Saberback and Striker. In ''[[The Land Before Time]]'' and its sequels, the character [[Spike (The Land Before Time)|Spike]] is a young ''Stegosaurus''. In the 1980s cartoon ''[[Dinosaucers]]'', the character Stego is an anthropomorphic ''Stegosaurus'' who, while still only a trainee soldier, accomplishes difficult tasks despite his inexperience. Also, Stegz was an anthropomorphic stegosaur featured in the series ''[[Extreme Dinosaurs]]''. Ironically, despite the tiny brain size of ''Stegosaurus'', he was the most intelligent of the characters in the show. One of the Dino Knights and Drago Clones in ''[[Dinozaurs]]'' were Dino Stego and his evil counterpart Drago Stegus. In the [[YouTube]] series "'''asdfmovie'''," there is a running gag in the series that a character would get crushed by a foot, and the camera zooms out to show a dinosaur who looks nothing like a ''Stegosaurus'' (no back plates, longer neck, taller structure, and longer tail). Then the dinosaur says, "I am a ''Stegosaurus''!"

[[Gary Larson]]'s ''[[The Far Side]]'' comic strip often used stegosaurs when he showed dinosaurs. The term "[[Thagomizer]]" originated as a joke from a ''Far Side'' [[comic strip]], in which a group of [[caveman|cavemen]] in a lecture hall are taught by their caveman professor that the spikes were named in honor of "the late Thag Simmons" (the implication is that the Thagomizer was responsible for Thag's death). The term has been popularly adopted by many [[palaeontology|palaeontological]] authorities,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/mg19125592.200.html "The word: Thagomizer," ''New Scientist,'' July 8, 2006.

==Science==
[[File:Stego.jpg|thumb|Early restoration by [[Charles R. Knight]]]]
In September 2002, a hoax poster was presented at the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology entitled "The case for ''Stegosaurus'' as an agile, [[cursorial]] [[biped]]", ostensibly by T. R. Karbek (an anagram of [[Robert T. Bakker|R. T. Bakker]]) from the non-existent "Steveville Academy of Palaeontological Studies".  This was reported in ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine, where it was remarked that ''Stegosaurus'' was generally believed to be "about as cursorial as a fridge-freezer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Sculpture==
[[File:Bałtów Park Jurajski 001.jpg|thumb|Model ''Stegosaurus'', Bałtów Jurassic Park, [[Poland]].]]
Sculptor [[Jim Gary]] created several, almost-life-sized versions of ''Stegosaurus''. Beginning in the 1960s, one always was displayed among his traveling exhibition, ''Jim Gary's Twentieth Century Dinosaurs'', and they are frequently used as an illustration of his work in books and articles about the artist because of their distinctive characteristics. One of these was displayed for months before the electrical engineering research facility at the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]] during a 2005 campus-wide display of the exhibition, which was hosted by [[Belk College of Business|Belk College]], and became a [[mascot]] of sorts to students studying in nearby buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Light emitting diodes (LED) &amp; optoelectronic device research at UNC Charlotte| work =| publisher =[[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]]| date =| url =http://www.ece.uncc.edu/~ebstokes/research.htm| accessdate =2006-12-26| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070112151337/http://www.ece.uncc.edu/~ebstokes/research.htm| archivedate =2007-01-12| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ece.uncc.edu/~ebstokes/research.htm|title=Ed Stokes|work=Ed Stokes|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415154657/http://ece.uncc.edu/~ebstokes/research.htm|archivedate=2012-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]] walked under a Jim Gary ''Stegosaurus'' when a museum display of Gary's work was used as a set for the 1986 film.

In 1973 [[Alexander Calder]] also created a huge sculpture called, ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', that was more abstract than Gary's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/sftrajan/2845071149/|title=Calder's Stegosaurus and the Travelers tower, Hartford|work=Flickr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stands 50 feet tall in Hartford, Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/hartford/hartford.html|title=Images of Stegosaurus, Hartford, Connecticut, 1973, by Alexander Calder.

==Theme parks==
A battle between a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' and a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' similar to the [[Rite of Spring]] scene animated for ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' was created using new [[Audio-Animatronics]] for Disney's Magic Skyway attraction at the [[1964 World's Fair]]. When the Fair ended, the attraction was dismantled. However, in 1966 the dinosaurs were moved next to the Grand Canyon Diorama along the [[Disneyland Railroad]] to make the [[Primeval World]]. [[Tokyo Disneyland]]'s [[Western River Railroad]] has the same diorama. A similar scene is depicted in [[Epcot]]'s [[Universe of Energy]] pavilion.

==Other==
''Stegosaurus'' has long been featured in popular informational books about dinosaurs. This is ostensibly due to its status as being one of the most famous dinosaurs in popular culture. Several older nonfiction books incorrectly stated that ''Stegosaurus'' had two brains, due to a mistake made by Marsh during the 1800s, in which a bundle of nerves located in the hips was thought to be a "second brain". However, newer informational works have corrected this, and most nonfiction dinosaur books published nowadays correctly state that ''Stegosaurus'' had only one — albeit tiny — brain, located in its skull, as all other known vertebrates do. ''Stegosaurus'' has also featured in numerous video games such as ''[[Zoo Tycoon: Dinosaur Digs]]'' and ''[[Carnivores (video game)|Carnivores]]''. In the latter game, the animal was depicted as an awkward, lumbering reptile, similar to many outdated illustrations, even though the game was released in 1998, at least a decade after the general public recognized ''Stegosaurus'' and other dinosaurs as active warm-blooded beasts. Players can play as ''Stegosaurus'' in ''[[Combat of Giants]]''. A stuffed ''Stegosaurus'' makes an appearance in the video game ''[[Gone Home]]'', nicknamed Steggy.

'''Street fighting''' is [[hand-to-hand combat]] in public places, between individuals or groups of people.&lt;ref name="kungfumagazine"&gt;{{cite news|title= Reality Fighting, Street Fighting &amp; Self Defense|work= [[Kung Fu Tai Chi|Kung Fu Magazine]] |date=|url=http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=552|accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[sport fighting]], a street fight might involve weapons, multiple opponents, and no rules. The venue is usually a public place (e.g. a street) and the fight sometimes results in  serious injury or occasionally even death.&lt;ref name="kungfumagazine" /&gt;

The main difference between street fighting and a [[self defense]] situation is that a street fight is avoidable, whereas a self-defense situation is not. The other main difference is that the fight is consensual between both parties. A typical situation might involve two men arguing in a [[bar (establishment)|bar]], then one suggests stepping outside, where the fight commences. Thus, it is often possible to avoid the fight by backing off, while in self-defense, a person is actively trying to escape the situation, using force if necessary to ensure his or her own safety.&lt;ref name="kungfumagazine" /&gt;

In some [[martial arts]] communities, street fighting and self-defense are often considered synonymous.&lt;ref name="kungfumagazine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Street fight – practical self defence|url=http://skbu.cz/co-umime/street-fight/|accessdate=2010-09-15|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, '''[[suicide]] terminology''' has been rife with issues of nomenclature,&lt;ref&gt;Archives of Suicide Research, 1997, vol. 3, pp. 139–151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Babel"&gt;O'Carroll et al. (1996). Beyond the Tower of Babel: A nomenclature for suicidology. Suicide &amp; Life Threatening Behavior, 26(3), 237-252.&lt;/ref&gt; and terminology has often been defined differently depending on the purpose of the definition (e.g., medical, legal, administrative). A lack of agreed-upon [[nomenclature]] and [[operational definitions]] has complicated understanding. In 2007, attempts were made to reach some consensus.&lt;ref name="Babel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Silverman1"&gt;Silverman MM, Berman AL, Sanddal ND, et al. Rebuilding the Tower of Babel: a revised nomenclature for the study of suicide and suicidal behaviors. Part 1: background, rationale, and methodology. Suicide Life Threat Behav 2007; 37:248–63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Silverman2"&gt;Silverman MM, Berman AL, Sanddal ND, et al. Rebuilding the Tower of Babel: a revised nomenclature for the study of suicide and suicidal behaviors. Part 2: suicide-related ideations, communications, and behaviors. Suicide Life Threat Behav 2007; 37:264–77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Posner"&gt;Posner K, Oquendo MA, Gould M, et al. Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA): classification of suicidal events in the FDA's pediatric suicidal
risk analysis of antidepressants" ''Am J Psychiatry'' 2007; 164:1035–43.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also controversy over the terms commit and committed as they relate to completed and [[attempted suicide]].

== Suicide-related ideations ==

'''Suicidal ideation''' is any self-reported thoughts of engaging in suicide-related behavior.&lt;ref name="Babel" /&gt; Subtypes of suicide-related ideations depend on the presence or absence of suicidal intent.

To have '''suicidal intent''' is to have suicide or deliberate self-killing as one's purpose.&lt;ref name="Leenars"&gt;Leenars, A. A. (2004). Psychotherapy with suicidal people. West Sussex, UK: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Intent refers to the aim, purpose, or goal of the behavior rather than the behavior itself.&lt;ref name="Silverman1" /&gt; The term connotes a conscious desire or wish to leave or escape from life, and also connotes a resolve to act. This is contrasted with '''suicidal motivation,''' or the driving force behind ideation or intent, which need not be conscious.

=== With no suicidal intention ===
''Suicide-related ideation with no suicidal intention'' is when an individual has thoughts of engaging in suicide-related behavior but has no intention to do so.&lt;ref name="Silverman2" /&gt;

=== With undetermined degree of suicidal intent ===
When an individual is unable to clarify whether suicidal intent was present or not, the term ''undetermined degree of suicidal intent'' is used.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt;

=== With some suicidal intent ===
''Suicide-related ideation with some suicidal intent'' is when an individual has thoughts of engaging in suicide-related behavior and possesses suicidal intent.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt;

== Suicide-related communications ==

'''Suicide-related communications''' are any interpersonal act of imparting, conveying, or transmitting thoughts, wishes, desires, or intent for which there is evidence (either explicit or implicit) that the act of communication is not itself a self-inflicted behavior or self-injurious.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt; This broad definition includes two subsets.

A '''suicide threat''' is any interpersonal action, verbal or nonverbal, without a direct self-injurious component, that a reasonable person would interpret as communicating or suggesting that suicidal behavior might occur in the near future.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt;

A '''suicide plan''' is a proposed method of carrying out a design that will lead to a potentially self-injurious outcome; a systematic formulation of a program of action that has the potential for resulting in self-injury.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt;

===With No Suicidal Intent ===

====Suicide Threat, Type I====
''Suicide Threat, Type I'' is a suicide threat with no associated suicidal intent. The threat may be verbal or nonverbal, passive or active.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt;

====Suicide Plan, Type I====
''Suicide Plan, Type I'' is the expression of a definite plan to end one's life but with no suicidal intent.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt;

=== With Undetermined Degree of Suicide Intent ===

====Suicide Threat, Type II====
''Suicide Threat,  Type II'' is a suicide threat with an undetermined level of suicidal intent. The threat may be verbal or nonverbal, passive or covert.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt;

====Suicide Plan, Type II====
''Suicide Plan, Type II'' is a proposed method of achieving a potentially self-injurious outcome with an undetermined level of intent.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt;

===With Some Degree of Suicidal Intent===

====Suicide Threat, Type III====
''Suicide Threat, Type III'' is a suicide threat with some degree of suicidal intent. The threat may be verbal or nonverbal, passive or covert.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt;

====Suicide Plan, Type III====
''Suicide Plan, Type III'' is a proposed method of achieving a potentially self-injurious outcome with some suicidal intent.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt;

== Suicide-related behaviors ==

'''Suicide related behavior''' is a self-inflicted, potentially injurious behavior for which there is evidence (either explicit or implicit) either that: (a) the person wished to use the appearance of intending to kill himself/herself in order to attain some other end; or (b) the person intended at some undetermined or some known degree to kill himself/herself.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt; Suicide-related behaviors can result in no injuries, injuries, or death. Suicide-related behaviors comprise self-harm, self-inflicted unintentional death, undetermined suicide-related behaviors, self-inflicted death with undetermined intent, suicide attempt, and suicide.

'''Self-harm''' is self-inflicted, potentially injurious behavior for which there is evidence (either implicit or explicit) that the person did not intend to kill himself/herself (i.e., had no intent to die).&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt; Persons engage in self-harm behaviors when they wish to use the appearance of intending to kill themselves in order to attain some other end (e.g., to seek help, to punish others, to receive attention, or to regulate negative mood). Self-harm may result in no injuries, injuries, or death.

Suicide gesture is an outdated term. Behavior that previously might have been labeled a suicide gesture, if there is no suicidal intent, is labeled as Self Harm, Type I (no injury) or Self-Harm, Type II (with injury), because the purpose of the behaviors is to alter one's life circumstances (interpersonal or intrapersonal) in a manner without suicidal intent but involving self-inflicted behaviors (whether or not it resulted in injuries). If there is an undetermined degree of suicidal intent, it is labeled as Undetermined Suicide-Related Behavior, Type I (no injury), or Undetermined Suicide-Related Behavior, Type II (with injury).&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt;

===With No Suicidal Intent===

====Self-Harm, Type I====
''Self-Harm, Type I'' is self-harm that has not resulted in injury.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt;

====Self-Harm, Type II====
''Self-Harm, Type II'' is self-harm that has resulted in nonfatal injury.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt;

====Self-Inflicted Unintentional Death====
''Self-Inflicted Unintentional Death'' is self-harm that has resulted in death.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt; It is defined as from self-inflicted injury, poisoning, or suffocation where there is evidence (either explicit or implicit) that there was no intent to die. This category includes those injuries or poisonings described as unintended or accidental.

===With Undetermined Degree of Suicide Intent===
'''Suicide-related Behavior With Undetermined Degree of Suicide Intent''' is self-inflicted, potentially injurious behavior where intent is unknown.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt;

====Undetermined Suicide-Related Behavior, Type I====
''Undetermined Suicide-Related Behavior, Type I'' is self-injurious behavior that has not resulted in injuries and for which the person is unable to admit positively to the intent to die or is reluctant to admit positively to the intent to die due to other psychological states.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt;

====Undetermined Suicide-Related Behavior, Type II====
''Undetermined Suicide-Related Behavior, Type II'' is self-injurious behavior that has resulted in injuries and for which the person is unable to admit positively to the intent to die or is reluctant to admit positively to the intent to die due to other psychological states.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt;

====Self-Inflicted Death with Undetermined Intent====
''Self-Inflicted Death with Undetermined Intent'' is self-injurious behavior that has resulted in fatal injury and for which intent is either equivocal or unknown.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt;

===With Some Degree of Suicidal Intent===
A '''suicide attempt''' is defined as a self-inflicted, potentially injurious behavior with a nonfatal outcome for which there is evidence (either explicit or implicit) of intent to die. A suicide attempt may result in no injuries, injuries, or death.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt;

====Suicide Attempt, Type I====
Suicide Attempt, Type I is a suicide attempt with some degree of suicidal intent and no resultant injuries, regardless of the degree of injury or lethality of method.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt;

====Suicide Attempt, Type II====
Suicide Attempt, Type II is a suicide attempt with some degree of suicidal intent and resultant injuries.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt;

====Suicide====
A '''suicide''' is a self-inflicted death with evidence (either explicit or implicit) of intent to die.&lt;ref name="Silverman2"/&gt; The term '''completed suicide''' has also been used synonymously, but is generally believed to be redundant and potentially pejorative, and, as such, is not recommended.

== Controversy over use of "commit" and "committed"==

According to [[Ronald Fairbairn|Fairbairn]], "The most common way of speaking about suicide is to talk of its being 'committed'."&lt;ref name="Fairbairn 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=Gavin J|title=Contemplating Suicide: The Language and Ethics of Self-Harm|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415106061|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rorke-SCOaYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, "committed suicide" or similar descriptions continue to be the norm in both scholarly research and journalism.&lt;ref name="Olsen 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olson|first=Robert|title=Suicide and Language|journal=Centre for Suicide Prevention|year=2011|series=InfoExchange|issue=3|page=4|url=http://suicideinfo.ca/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=sNKET0k90VY%3d&amp;tabid=554|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beaton 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beaton|first=Susan|author2=Forster, Peter |author3=Maple, Myfanwy  |title= Suicide and Language: Why we Shouldn't Use the 'C' Word|journal=In Psych|date=February 2013|volume=35|issue=1|pages=30–31|url= http://www.psychology.org.au/Content.aspx?ID=5048}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocacy groups have suggested that this phrasing has become so entrenched in English vocabulary that it has gained "a naturalness which implies a deceptive harmlessness."&lt;ref name="Olsen 2011"/&gt; Fairburn further acknowledged the difficulty in finding alternative means of referring to suicide which "are neither clumsy nor misleading,"&lt;ref name="Fairbairn 1995"/&gt;

However, while common, Lebacqz &amp; Englehardt argue that referring to suicide as an act "committed" may be hazardous to ethical clarity.&lt;ref name="Lebacqz 1980"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lebacqz |first1=K. |last2=Englehardt |first2=H.T. |editor1-last=Battin |editor1-first=M.P. |editor2-last=Mayo |editor2-first=D.J. |title=Suicide: the philosophical issues |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's |year=1980 |page=672 |chapter=Suicide and covenant |isbn=978-0312775315 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have also argued in favour of alternative language regarding suicide, both in the interest of moral and ethical precision,&lt;ref name="Beaton 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sommer-Rotenberg 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sommer-Rotenberg|first=D.|title=Suicide and language|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=11 August 1998|volume=159|issue=3|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/159/3/239.full.pdf+html?sid=a8e8bfae-6950-4f93-92fe-9c612f41229b|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as scientific and clinical clarity.&lt;ref name="Babel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Silverman2" /&gt; A [[United States Navy]] report urges against the use of the term "committed suicide" on similar grounds, asserting that "suicide is better understood when framed objectively within the context of behavioral health."&lt;ref name="Navy 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=What's in a word? How we talk about Suicide|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/support/suicide_prevention/HowToHelp/Documents/What's%20in%20a%20Word%20(Gen).pdf|work=Navy Suicide Prevention|publisher=United States Navy: Navy Personnel Command|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alleged lack of clarity in English suicide terminology has been attributed to the connotations of crime, dishonour, and sin that suicide may carry.&lt;ref name="Silverman 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silverman|first=M.M.|title=The Language of Suicidology|journal=Suicide and Life-Threatening Behaviour |date=October 2006 |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=519–532|doi=10.1521/suli.2006.36.5.519|pmid=17087631}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC 2001"&gt;{{cite web |title=Reporting on Suicide: Recommendations for the Media |year=2001 |website=Suicide Prevention Resource Center |url=http://www.sprc.org/sites/sprc.org/files/library/sreporting.pdf |accessdate=16 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530170905/http://www.sprc.org/sites/sprc.org/files/library/sreporting.pdf |archive-date=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German term ''Selbstmord begehen'' is similar, denoting an act of commission.&lt;ref name="Sommer-Rotenberg 1998" /&gt; Common language has been described as "[portraying] suicide as a 'crime' to be 'committed' as is, for example, murder."&lt;ref name="Lebacqz 1980"/&gt; This is despite the fact that suicide is largely no longer a crime,&lt;ref name="Beaton 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alberta 2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=What's in a word? The Language of Suicide|url=http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/MentalHealthWellness/hi-mhw-sps-language-of-suicide-1p.pdf|publisher=Alberta Health Services|accessdate=15 May 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that, as noted suicidologist Samuel Wallace wrote, "all suicide is neither abhorrent nor not; insane or not; selfish or not; rational or not; justifiable or not."&lt;ref name="Wallace 1999"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wallace |first1=S.E. |editor1-last=Werth |editor1-first=J.L. Jr. |title=Contemporary Perspectives on Rational Suicide |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1999 |pages=48–53 |chapter=The Moral Imperative to Suicide |isbn=978-0876309377 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian suicide prevention activist, P. Bonny Ball, commented that the alleged criminal implications of suicide are a carryover from the Middle Ages when suicide was considered "both illegal and sinful by the laws and religions of the time."&lt;ref name="Ball 2005"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ball|first=P. Bonny|title=The Power of words|url=http://www.suicideprevention.ca/about-suicide/the-power-of-words/|publisher=Canadian Association of Suicide Prevention|accessdate=16 May 2013|year=2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513011216/http://www.suicideprevention.ca/about-suicide/the-power-of-words/|archivedate=13 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sommer-Rotenberg had similarly argued that "the act of self-killing was considered criminal because it was perceived as transgressing the moral authority of God and the righteous feelings of humankind."&lt;ref name="Sommer-Rotenberg 1998" /&gt;

Since "committing suicide" was akin to committing [[murder]] or rape, it has been argued that they continue to be linked in some languages.&lt;ref name="Olsen 2011"/&gt; However, this common English expression is not universal: "By contrast the French ''se suicider'' and the Italian ''uccidersi'' are reflexive. Likewise in [[Hebrew]]: ''l'hit'abbed'', 'to self-destroy,' is something one does to oneself, with no implication of criminality."&lt;ref name="Sommer-Rotenberg 1998" /&gt;

Various alternatives have been proposed to alter the language regarding the act of suicide from a variety of sectors – including government, [[journalism]], community [[mental health]] advocates, and the [[scientific community]]. Terms such as "death by suicide," and "non-fatal suicide attempt" have been suggested to be more objective.&lt;ref name="Navy 2013" /&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] has agreed that these terms "are more accurate and less open to misinterpretation."&lt;ref name="WHO 2008"&gt;{{cite book|title=Preventing suicide : a resource for media professionals|year=2008|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=978-92-4-159707-4|page=8|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/resource_media.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institute of Mental Health]], the largest research organization in the world specializing in mental illness, also recommends such phrasing as "completed suicide," or "kill him/herself."&lt;ref name="NIMH 2001"&gt;{{cite web|title=Recommendations for Reporting on Suicide|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/suicide-prevention/save_310_guide_v6.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health|accessdate=15 May 2013|year=2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427114237/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/suicide-prevention/save_310_guide_v6.pdf|archivedate=27 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it applies to a direct clinical context, the widely cited Beck Classification of Suicidal Behaviour exclusively uses the terminology of "complete suicide."&lt;ref name="Beck 1974"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Beck|editor1-first=A.T. |editor2-last=Resnik|editor2-first=H.L.P.|editor3-last=Lettieri|editor3-first=D.J |title=The prediction of suicide |location=Bowie, MD |publisher=Charles Press |year=1974 |page=41 |chapter=Development of suicidal intent scales |isbn=978-0913486139 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; This classification was revisited in a number of notable documents (such as the Operational Classification for Determination of Suicide, the 'Tower of Babel' nomenclature, the WHO/EURO definitions, the [[Columbia University]] suicidality classification, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] self-directed violence surveillance system, and the Denver VA VISN 19 MIRECC self-directed violence classification system).&lt;ref name="Silverman 2011"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=O'Connor |editor1-first=R.C. |editor2-last=Platt |editor2-first=S.|editor3-last=Gordon |editor3-first=J. |title=International Handbook of Suicide Prevention: Research, Policy &amp; Practice |location=Oxford |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2011 |pages=18–21 |chapter=Challenges to Classifying Suicidal Ideations, Communications, and Behaviours |isbn=978-0470683842 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reese@72.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Terence Reese as a young man]]
'''John Terence Reese''' (28 August 1913 – 29 January 1996) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Contract bridge|bridge]] player and writer, regarded as one of the finest of all time in both fields. He was born in [[Epsom]], Surrey, England to middle-class parents, and was educated at [[Bradfield College]] and [[New College, Oxford]], where he studied classics and attained a [[double first]], graduating in 1935.

== Life ==
Reese's father, the son of a Welsh clergyman, worked in a bank until he transferred to his wife's family catering business. Reese said "I played card games before I could read".&lt;ref name="BT"&gt;Reese (1977), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; As a small boy, when his mother "issued the standard warning about not talking to strange men, my father remarked that it was the strange men who should be warned against trying to talk to me".&lt;ref name=BT/&gt;

Reese's mother Anne ran a hotel near [[Guildford]], and with it a bridge club, so Reese played in the earliest duplicate matches, ''circa'' 1930. Whilst at Oxford he met some serious bridge players, amongst whom were Lt.-Col. [[Walter Buller (bridge)|Walter Buller]], [[Iain Macleod]] and [[Maurice Harrison-Gray]], the strongest player in the country at that time. Within a year of graduating and after a brief stint at Harrod's, Reese started working for [[Hubert Phillips]]'s magazine and co-wrote his first book with him in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Hubert, and Terence Reese (1937). ''The Elements of Contract''. London: British Bridge World. 271 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips acknowledges that although the book is published jointly under their names, "Terence is the real author of the book",&lt;ref&gt;Phillips and Reese (1937), Introduction by Phillips, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; receiving only assistance in planning contents and editing from Phillips. From that point on, Reese's profession was that of a champion contract bridge player and prolific writer on the game.

Reese joined the [[Air Raid Precautions|ARP]] a few months before the war, and was never inducted into the armed forces. He ended up working in the factory of Pedro Juan (a fellow bridge player), which manufactured black-out curtains. When a [[Ministry of Labour (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Labour]] inspector turned up to check on him, a hasty phone-call was needed to get Terence into an office surrounded by ledgers.&lt;ref&gt;Reese (1977), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reese had some hobbies; even those he pursued with typical commitment. He was always a [[cricket]] and [[chess]] enthusiast. After [[World War II]], he [[mathematics of bookmaking|made a book]] on [[greyhound racing]]; later he became an avid football fan, reputedly supporting [[Queen's Park Rangers]], whose ground was next door to the [[White City Stadium]], a home of greyhound racing. He played various other games for money, especially [[canasta]], [[poker]] and [[backgammon]], and wrote books on them.

From the late 1930s to the mid-1950s, Reese presented a number of BBC radio and television programmes about bridge.&lt;ref&gt;Shireen Mohandes, ''Bridge'', May 2016, "On the Air", pp. 36-7.&lt;/ref&gt; He edited the ''British Bridge World'' from 1956 to 1962.

He married Alwyn Sherrington in 1970. They resided in London and later in [[Brighton and Hove|Hove]], Sussex, where he died of aspirin poisoning at home on 29 January 1996 at the age of 83. An inquest ruled his death accidental.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;[[David Bird (bridge writer)|Bird, David]] (2004). [Reese entry]. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Volume 46. {{ISBN|0-19-861396-2}}. Page 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career as a player ==

As a bridge player, Reese won every honour in the game, including the European Championship four times (1948, 1949, 1954, 1963) and the [[Bermuda Bowl]] (effectively, the World Team Championship) in 1955—all as a member of the Great Britain open team. He was World Par champion{{clarify|date=November 2014}} in 1961 and placed second&lt;!--silver medal?--&gt; in both the inaugural [[World Team Olympiad]], 1960, and the inaugural [[World Open Pairs]], 1962. He also represented Britain in the 1965 Bermuda Bowl and in five other European Championships.{{clarify|date=November 2014|reason=should and does this cover events not mentioned just above as 1sts and 2nds?}} He won the [[Gold Cup (bridge)|Gold Cup]], the premier British domestic competition, on eight occasions.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge]]''. Editions 1–4, New York: [[Crown Publishers|Crown]], 1964–1984. Editions 5–6, Memphis: [[American Contract Bridge League|ACBL]], 1994–2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reese last participated in international bridge at the 1976 World Team Olympiad in Monte Carlo, where Great Britain placed third.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbridge.org/competitions/worldchampionships/TeamChampMembers.asp?qteamid=4965&amp;qmenudetid=242 World Bridge Federation results and participants, 1976.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306051139/http://www.worldbridge.org/competitions/worldchampionships/TeamChampMembers.asp?qteamid=4965&amp;qmenudetid=242 |date=6 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was Britain's non-playing captain in the 1981 European Team Championships in Birmingham, England,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/european_championships/TeamChampMembers.asp?qteamid=2760&amp;qmenudetid=45 European Bridge League results and participants, 1981.]&lt;/ref&gt; placing second. Thus Great Britain qualified for the [[Bermuda Bowl#1981 New York City, USA|1981 Bermuda Bowl]]&lt;!-- field expanded to include two EBL teams --&gt;, but the WBF credentials committee rejected Reese as captain, citing "writings and opinions expressed by Mr. Reese that were considered not in the best interests of the game", in the words of ''New York Times'' bridge editor [[Alan Truscott]]—primarily the "sordid picture of top-level bridge" presented by Reese and Jeremy Flint in their 1979 novel ''Trick Thirteen''.&lt;ref&gt;Truscott, Alan (21 September 1981). [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/21/nyregion/bridge-ban-on-r-eese-had-roots-in-h-is-writings-on-game.html "Bridge: Ban on Reese Had Roots In His Writings on Game"]. ''The New York Times''. Retrieved 2014-11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain appealed to the WBF executive council but Reese chose to remain home.&lt;ref&gt;Truscott, Alan (18 October 1981). [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/18/nyregion/world-bridge-play-coming-to-county.html "World Bridge Play Coming to County"]. ''The New York Times''. Retrieved 2014-11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preferring [[backgammon]] as an alternative in his later years, Reese played little competitive bridge, owing in part to increasing deafness.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reese (1977), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, his career as a bridge writer continued unabated.

=== The Little Major ===

{{Main|Little Major}}
The concept for "the Little Major was born"&lt;ref name="BatTop"&gt;Reese (1977), p. 112–16.&lt;/ref&gt; in late 1962, while Reese was en route to a tournament in the Canary Islands with [[Boris Schapiro]].

First with Schapiro and then [[Jeremy Flint]], Reese initially created the ''Little Major'' bidding system as a warning of what would happen if the development of artificial bidding systems was allowed to go unchecked. However, under this camouflage, the system was a genuine attempt with interesting features. Ultimately, the system was abandoned when its two-year [[English Bridge Union|EBU]] 'A' license was withdrawn "on the grounds that not enough players were playing the system".&lt;ref name=BatTop/&gt;

=== Opinions of Reese ===

Reese's long-time partner, Boris Schapiro, put his opinion in a 1951 bridge magazine article:
:"Terence Reese: brilliant, tenacious and imaginative; any amount of courage, very good bidder, immaculate dummy player and defender, never puts pressure on partner. Concentration first class; difficult to play against."&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, Boris (1951). "Knights of the square table". ''Contract Bridge Journal''. Reprinted in Hasenson (2004), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven years later, Schapiro still thought Reese was the best player in the country:
:"Reese is still the best, and in my opinion by a greater margin than before. His dummy and defence are as immaculate as ever, and the old gentleman has actually polished up his bidding. Believe it or not, he has condescended to play 'fourth suit forcing' and Stayman, and I strongly suspect that by 1973 he will be giving the Baron system a close look."&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, Boris (1962). &lt;!--title?--&gt; ''Contract Bridge Journal''. Reprinted in Hasenson (2004), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon Reese's death in 1996, Schapiro wrote:
:"...&amp;nbsp;Terence was the best player, one of only two geniuses I have known. The other was [[Emanuel Lasker|Lasker]], the chess player. Terence was not a slow player but occasionally he went into a trance. I didn't mind and could sit there and wait. I knew that when he eventually played a card it would be the right one."&lt;ref&gt;Hasenson (2004), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Victor Mollo had this to say about Reese in 1967:
:Terence Reese is, perhaps, the best bridge player in the world. Cold, aloof, dispassionate, he has many admirers... and a host of enemies. Intelligence of a high order&amp;nbsp;... the impression of a one-sided but very unusual personality.&lt;ref&gt;Mollo, Victor (1967). ''The Bridge Immortals''. London: Faber. Page 85. (US edition, 1968). New York: Hart Publishing. Page 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Truscott wrote in ''The New York Times'' two weeks after Reese's death:
:"Reese was even more famous as a newspaper columnist, a theorist and a writer. Two of his early books, ''Reese on Play'' and ''The Expert Game'', were classics, and are still read by every serious student of bridge."&lt;ref name=truscott&gt;Truscott, Alan (12 February 1996). [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/12/nyregion/bridge-039284.html "Bridge"]. ''The New York Times''. Retrieved 2014-11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Buenos Aires affair ==
In the 1965 [[Buenos Aires]] Bermuda Bowl, [[B. Jay Becker]] noticed Reese and his partner, [[Boris Schapiro]], holding their cards in unusual ways during bidding, the number of fingers showing indicating length of the heart suit. A number of players and observers, including [[Dorothy Hayden]], New York Times columnists [[Alan Truscott]],  [[John Gerber (bridge)|John Gerber]], British nonplaying captain [[Ralph Swimer]], British Bridge League Chairman Geoffrey Butler, ACBL president emeritus [[Waldemar von Zedtwitz]], and ACBL President Robin McNabb, all watched Reese and Schapiro and were convinced that they were signalling illegally. It was also confirmed that Reese was not using such signals while playing with his other partner, [[Jeremy Flint]]. At a hearing held at the tournament site in Buenos Aires, the [[World Bridge Federation]] (WBF) judged Reese and Schapiro guilty of cheating, and announced that due to "certain irregularities", the British team was forfeiting the matches they had already won against North America and Argentina, and that Reese and Shapiro would not be playing in the remaining matches.

The [[British Bridge League]] (BBL) subsequently convened their own enquiry, chaired by Sir [[John Foster (British politician)|John Foster]], barrister and Member of Parliament, and [[Geoffrey Bourne, Baron Bourne|General Lord Bourne]]. After hearing lasting many months, including a surprise revelation by Swimer that Schapiro had confessed his guilt to him, the "Foster Enquiry" found insufficient evidence to find Reese and Schapiro guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Without rebutting the "direct" evidence that grips were correlated with heart count, the report emphasized that there was inconclusive evidence that the players had benefitted from the signals in their bidding or play.

In 1967, the BBL asked the WBF to reverse their guilty finding; the WBF responded by unanimously reaffirming their guilty verdict, and later reiterating that they would not accept a British team including Reese and Schapiro for the 1968 Olympiad, which the BBL boycotted in protest. In 1968, a compromise was reached, the WBF maintaining their guilty verdict, but allowing Reese and Schapiro (who had announced his retirement from international bridge after the Buenos Aires Olympiad) to play in future world championships.

Subsequently, both Reese &lt;ref&gt;Reese, Terence (1966). ''The Story of an Accusation''. London: Heinemann. [[LCCN]] 67075048. 244 pages. (US edition, 1967). New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. LCCN 67017872. 246 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; and Alan Truscott&lt;ref&gt;Truscott, Alan (1969). ''The Great Bridge Scandal''. Yarborough Press.&lt;/ref&gt; published books on the scandal. Reese's book stated: "The basis of the charge, as everybody knows, is that Schapiro and I communicated length in hearts to one another by means of illegal signals. If you want to support that charge by reference to the hands played, what you have to show is that a number of illogical, uncharacteristic, and implausible bids or plays were made that can be explained only on the basis that the players had improper knowledge of one another's hands." It then goes on to argue for the logic of the pair's bidding and play on the various hands from the Olympiad. Truscott's book emphasizes the unlikelihood of the observed variations in finger signals being coincidental, or of such a large number of witnesses colluding to fabricate the evidence. It also recounts a number of previous cheating accusations against Reese and Schapiro (including games other than bridge).  
 
In May 2005, the English journalist David Rex-Taylor, a bridge player and publisher, claimed that Reese had made a confession to him forty years earlier, one that was not to be revealed until 2005 and after he and Schapiro were dead.&lt;ref&gt;Alder, Philip.[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/20/crosswords/bridge/20card.html "Cheating Scandal From '65 Rears Head Again"]. ''The New York Times''. 20 Jun 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The purported confession claimed that Reese and Schapiro were indeed signalling, but only to show that such signaling was possible (and so were not actually paying attention to each other's signals), purportedly as part of a book on cheating (which was abandoned after the scandal broke). Although this explanation could conceivably reconcile the use of finger signals with the absence of evidence from bidding or play, there is no corroborating evidence to support this account. In contrast, Schapiro's widow claims he continued to deny the accusations to his death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-buenos-aires-affair-card-tricksters-490277.html "The Buenos Aires affair: Card Tricksters"]. ''The Independent''. 11 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shenkinbridge.com/entertainment/ArticleDetails.aspx?articleID=93 Scandal in Buenos Aires Conclusion  by Barnet Shenkin]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career as a bridge author ==
{{Main|Terence Reese bibliography}}
{{Library resources box|by=yes|viaf=59484658}}
Reese also had a successful career as a bridge author and journalist, a career that lasted throughout his life. He was one of the most influential and acerbic of bridge writers, with a large output (over ninety titles&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;), including several books which remain in print as classics of bridge play. He was also the long-time bridge correspondent of ''[[The Lady (magazine)|The Lady]]'', ''[[The Observer]]'', the London ''[[Evening News (London)|Evening News]]'' and the ''[[Evening Standard]]''. He was also a frequent contributor to [[The Bridge World]] magazine which gave the following response to criticism of their continuing to publish articles by him after the Buenos Aires affair: {{quote|text=We have received several letters questioning our decision to publish articles by Terence Reese, in view of the World Bridge Federation ruling that he was guilty. Naturally, we received an equal number of letters from subscribers who vigorously applauded the appearance of this material, in view of the not-guilty verdict rendered by the British Bridge League following its enquiry.  As we see it, our own opinion on this case would have no bearing. The official position in this matter certainly must be regarded as muddled.  Therefore, we see no choice but to disregard this case and judge material received on its merit.|author=The Editors|source=The Bridge World, June 1968, Volume 39, Issue 9, page 3.}}

Reese contributed to the [[Acol]] bidding system  originally developed by [[Maurice Harrison-Gray]], [[Jack Marx (bridge)|Jack Marx]] and [[S.J. Simon|S.J.("Skid") Simon]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acolbridgeclub.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=49&amp;Itemid=57 Acol Bridge Club Website.]&lt;/ref&gt; and co-authored the first textbook on it with [[Ben Cohen (bridge)|Ben Cohen]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Cohen (bridge)|Cohen, Ben]] and Terence Reese, ''The Acol Two Club: with an introduction by S.J. Simon'', Leng, Sheffield, 1938. This was the first Acol textbook, its authors wisely disclaiming originality: "We do a job of reporting." It had a famous Preface, "Attitude of Mind" by [[S.J. Simon|Skid Simon]]. &amp;mdash; Second and subsequent editions titled ''The Acol System of contract bridge''. Joiner &amp; Steele, London. &amp;mdash; 2nd ed 1939; 3rd ed 1946, with 13 hands from the Waddington Par Contest; 4th ed 1949, with a selection of hands from the 1949 International Series; 5th ed [1956?], with a selection of hands from the 1955-56 international events and an Introduction by Guy Ramsey. The fourth edition introduced three new chapters on competitive bidding, mistakes to avoid, and two clubs over one no-trump (the Marx convention).&lt;/ref&gt; Named after the Acol Bridge Club in North [[London]] (located on Acol Road at the time&lt;ref&gt;{{OEB|6|14}}&lt;/ref&gt;), it became the prevailing bidding system in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and some other parts of the world. The book and its subsequent editions in 1939, 1946 and 1949 gave unity to what was otherwise a rather free-wheeling bidding system. His later adaptation of [[Benito Garozzo|Garozzo]] and [[Leon Yallouze|Yallouze]]'s book on the [[Blue Club]] and his book on the [[Precision Club]] were widely used by devotees of strong club systems, and by their opponents as references.

The great success of ''Reese on Play'' (an outstanding guide to dummy play and defence) was followed by an even more ambitious work. ''The Expert Game'' was the book which really made his name. As the title suggests, it dealt with card play at the highest level, including some ideas that were novel at the time, for instance, inferences from events that did not occur, and the [[principle of restricted choice]]. Examples of bridge logic abound in Reese, for instance, a player who overcalls but does not lead his suit is likely to lack one or two key honours; this concept is often called 'the dog that did not bark in the night' (after [[Sherlock Holmes]] in [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s "[[The Adventure of Silver Blaze]]"). Another form of logic can be seen in 'If it must be so, assume it is so'. His examples of ''counting'' (and other ways of drawing inferences from the bidding and play) spread such ideas from a coterie of masters in London (or New York) to a much wider group of nascent experts. For at least twenty years after this book was published, one could be sure that virtually every top-class player had studied it minutely.

Reese also had the distinction of creating several new genres of bridge book. The most significant was the 'Over my shoulder' genre, where the reader is taken through the master's thinking as the bidding and play proceeds through the hand. ''Play Bridge with Reese'' was the model for several such works. ''Develop Your Bidding Judgment'' was another such work.

Later, Reese made use of the growing library of hands from international competitions to create interesting quiz-type books, where the discussion was usually on the verso of the page which presented the problem. ''Famous Hands from Famous Matches'' was the first of these, followed by ''Famous Bidding Decisions'' and ''Famous Play Decisions'', all written with [[David Bird (bridge writer)|David Bird]]. In his career as a writer, Reese had a number of co-authors, mostly highly competent players and writers, yet all his books were in his inimitable style. Another of his ideas was to raid the stock of hands in bridge magazine bidding competitions for interesting and instructive hands. ''What Would &lt;u&gt;You&lt;/u&gt; Bid?'' was the result.

Reese also wrote books on poker, casino gambling, canasta and backgammon.

'''Teresa Amabile''' (born in 1950) is the [[Edsel Ford|Edsel Bryant Ford]] Professor of Business Administration in the Entrepreneurial Management Unit at [[Harvard Business School]].

==Biography==

Teresa Amabile is primarily known for her research and writing on creativity, dating to the late 1970s. Originally educated as a chemist, Amabile received her doctorate in psychology from [[Stanford University]] in 1977. She now studies how everyday life inside organizations can influence people and their performance. Her research encompasses creativity, productivity, innovation, and inner work life – the confluence of emotions, perceptions, and motivation that people experience as they react to events at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Potier |first=Beth |title=HBS's Teresa Amabile 'tracks creativity in the wild' |work=Harvard Gazette |date=February 10, 2005 |url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2005/02.10/09-amabile.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804110845/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2005/02.10/09-amabile.html |archivedate=August 4, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amabile's most recent discoveries appear in her book, ''The Progress Principle: Using Small Wins to Ignite Joy, Engagement, and Creativity at Work.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Amabile |first1=Teresa |last2=Kramer |first2=Steven |title=The Progress Principle: Using Small Wins to Ignite Joy, Engagement, and Creativity at Work |publisher=Harvard Business Review Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-1422198575 |url=http://progressprinciple.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published in August 2011 by Harvard Business Review Press, the book is co-authored with Amabile’s husband and collaborator, Steven Kramer, Ph.D.

Amabile has published over 100 scholarly articles and chapters, in outlets including top journals in psychology (such as ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'' and ''American Psychologist'') and in management (''Administrative Science Quarterly'', ''Academy of Management Journal''). She is also the author of ''The Work Preference Inventory'' and ''KEYS to Creativity and Innovation''. Amabile has used insights from her research in working with various groups in business, government, and education, including Procter &amp; Gamble, Novartis International AG, Motorola, IDEO, and the Creative Education Foundation. She has presented her theories, research results, and practical implications in dozens of forums, including the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Young Presidents’ Organization annual university, and the Front End of Innovation annual conference.

At Harvard Business School, Amabile has taught MBA and executive courses on managing for creativity, leadership, and ethics. Previously, at [[Brandeis University]], she taught social psychology, organizational psychology, the psychology of creativity, and statistics. She served as the host-instructor of the 26-part series, ''Against All Odds: Inside Statistics'', originally broadcast on PBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |title= Against All Odds: Inside Statistics |year=1989 |publisher=Annenberg Media |isbn=1-55946-091-1 |url=http://www.learner.org/resources/series65.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Transgender Pride flag.svg|thumb|One of the several [[Transgender flags|Transgender Pride Flags]] that are commonly used|324x324px]][[Transmasculine]] reproduction is when an individual with a [[masculine]] [[gender identity]], who was born with biologically [[Female reproductive system|female reproductive organs]], conceives and births a child. Transmasculine individuals were assigned female at birth, but identify more on the male side of the [[Gender Spectrum|gender spectrum]] than on the female side. These individuals may identify with some stereotypically [[masculine]] behaviors and [[gender performance]]s, but may not necessarily identify with all aspects of masculinity or refer to themselves as “a man”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engdahl|first=Ulrica|date=2014-05-01|title=Wrong Body|url=http://tsq.dukejournals.org/content/1/1-2/267|journal=TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly|language=en|volume=1|issue=1–2|pages=267–269|doi=10.1215/23289252-2400226|issn=2328-9252}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also born with [[mammary gland]]s and [[Lactiferous duct|milk ducts]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/08/chestfeeding/497015/|title=What It's Like to Chestfeed|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so in most cases it is also possible for them to [[Breastfeeding|breastfeed]] or “chest feed” their children even if they have had their breast surgically removed. Transmasculine reproduction is a matter of [[sexual and reproductive health]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nwhn.org/trans-mens-health-is-a-womens-health-issue-expanding-the-boundaries-of-sexual-reproductive-health-care/|title=Trans Men’s Health is a "Women’s Health" Issue: Expanding the Boundaries of Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health Care|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but transmasculine individuals commonly deal with lack of cooperation from health care professionals when attempting to seek medical attention for stereotypically “woman’s health issues”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Chestfeeding ==
Transmasculine individuals have several terms they use to describe the act of feeding their children with their bodies natural lactation. Some commonly used terms include chestfeeding,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; breastfeeding, [[nursing]], feeding, and mammal feeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.romper.com/p/what-is-chestfeeding-how-does-it-relate-to-breastfeeding-32294|title=What Is Chestfeeding &amp; How Does It Relate To Breastfeeding?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chestfeeding is a term that can be used by both [[cisgender]] and [[transgender]] parents to describe feeding their baby, since it is not gender exclusive. The term breastfeeding can cause feelings of [[gender dysphoria]] among transgender men. Gender dysphoria&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596.dsm14|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|date=2013-05-22|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=0890425558|series=DSM Library|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596.dsm14}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the emotional and psychological distress a person experiences when their gender identity does not aligned with their biological sex, and it can cause extreme anxiety, stress, and depression for those who experience it. Referring to transmasculine people’s chest as breasts can some trigger this dysphoria,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kellymom.com/bf/got-milk/transgender-parents-chestbreastfeeding/|title=Transgender Parents Chest/Breastfeeding|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is why [[Gender neutrality|gender neutral]] terms are often preferred.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-016-0907-y|title=Transmasculine individuals' experiences with lactation, chestfeeding, and gender identity: a qualitative study|journal=BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth|volume=16|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|doi=10.1186/s12884-016-0907-y|year=2016|last1=MacDonald|first1=Trevor|last2=Noel-Weiss|first2=Joy|last3=West|first3=Diana|last4=Walks|first4=Michelle|last5=Biener|first5=Marylynne|last6=Kibbe|first6=Alanna|last7=Myler|first7=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender dysphoria can also come to transmasculine individuals through the action of holding their baby to their chest to nurse,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; since it is a traditionally female action.&amp;nbsp;

Although both men and women are born with breasts, the presence of grown breasts on a transgender individual assigned female at birth can lead them to feel extreme discomfort in how their body aligns with their gender identity. It is a common choice for transgender men to have bilateral mastectomies or “chest surgery” due to the gender dysphoria surrounding their breasts. After a transmasculine individual has undergone a bilateral mastectomy their female breasts are no longer present, but they still have some mammary tissue and the ability to lactate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is not always easy for transgender men to lactate after chest surgery, but with the help of lactation nurses the option is available for those who feel comfortable doing so. Chestfeeding is a personal choice made by some, but not all transmasculine parents and it is just one aspect of transmasculine reproduction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Sexual and reproductive health care ==
Even though transmasculine individuals do not identify as women, they still need to screened for the same sexual and reproductive health problems covered in [[Women's health|women’s health]] as long as they have biologically female organs. Most transmasculine individuals are at risk for women’s heath problems like [[Cervical cancer|cervical]], [[Ovarian cancer|ovarian]], and [[uterine cancer]]s,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; unless they have their female organs removed as a part of their transition. Health care providers are not always aware of the necessity for transmasculine people to be tested for women’s health problems. There have been many instances of providers discriminating against trans individuals either by refusing service and treatment or being verbally abusive.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Doctors and health care providers should be aware of the needs of patients so they can properly treat them while respecting their gender identity so as to not create further gender dysmorphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snelgrove|first=John W.|last2=Jasudavisius|first2=Amanda M.|last3=Rowe|first3=Bradley W.|last4=Head|first4=Evan M.|last5=Bauer|first5=Greta R.|date=2012-01-01|title="Completely out-at-sea" with "two-gender medicine": A qualitative analysis of physician-side barriers to providing healthcare for transgender patients|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-12-110|journal=BMC Health Services Research|volume=12|pages=110|doi=10.1186/1472-6963-12-110|issn=1472-6963|pmc=3464167|pmid=22559234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical management of transmasculine patients can be complicated by a lack of knowledge about treatments which may be unfamiliar to physicians and failure to accommodate these patients within healthcare systems leads to deficient health policy.&amp;nbsp;

'''USS ''Argonaut'' (V-4/SF-7/SM-1/A-1/APS-1/SS-166''' (never formally held this classification)''')''' was a [[submarine]] of the [[United States Navy]], the first ship to carry the name. ''Argonaut'' was laid down as '''''V-4''''' on 1 May 1925 at [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 10 November 1927, [[Sponsor (military)|sponsored]] by Mrs. Philip Mason Sears, the daughter of [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] William D. MacDougall, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 2 April 1928, [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] W.M. Quigley in command. Although never officially designated as "SS-166", at some point she displayed this number on her conning tower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://navsource.org/archives/08/168/0816656.jpg Photo of ''Argonaut'' at NavSource.org with "166" on the conning tower.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
''V-4'' was the first of the second generation of [[V boat|V-boat]]s commissioned in the late 1920s, which remain the largest non-nuclear submarines ever built by the United States. ''V-4'' was the behemoth of its class. These submarines were exempt by special agreement from the armament and tonnage limitations of the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington Treaty]]. Her configuration, and that of the following ''V-5'' and ''V-6'', resulted from an evolving strategic concept that increasingly emphasized the possibility of a naval war with Japan in the far western Pacific. This factor, and the implications of the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]], suggested the need for long-range submarine "cruisers", or "strategic scouts", as well as long-range minelayers, for which long endurance, not high speed, was most important. The design was possibly influenced by the German "U-cruisers" of the [[German Type U 139 submarine|Type U-139]] and [[German Type U 151 submarine|Type U-151]] [[U-boat]] classes, although ''V-4'', ''V-5'', and ''V-6'' were all larger than these. ''V-4'' and her [[sister ship|near-sister]]s ''V-5'' ({{USS|Narwhal|SS-167|2}}) and ''V-6'' ({{USS|Nautilus|SS-168|2}}) were initially designed with larger and more powerful [[MAN SE|MAN-designed]] diesel engines than the [[Busch-Sulzer]] engines that propelled earlier V-boats, which were failures. Unfortunately, the specially built engines failed to produce their design power, and some developed dangerous crankcase explosions. ''V-4'' was ultimately completed with smaller MAN diesels of {{convert|1400|hp|abbr=on}}, compared with {{convert|2350|hp|abbr=on}} for ''V-5'' and ''V-6''. The smaller diesels were required to allow sufficient space for mine storage.

The engine specifications as built were two [[Bureau of Steam Engineering|BuEng]]-manufactured, [[MAN SE|MAN]]-designed direct-drive 6-[[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] [[Four-stroke engine|4-cycle]] main [[diesel engine]]s, {{convert|1400|hp|abbr=on}} each.&lt;ref name="FriedmanSubs1-specs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FriedmanSubs1-p259"/&gt; A BuEng MAN 6-cylinder 4-cycle auxiliary diesel engine of {{convert|450|hp|abbr=on}}, driving a [[Ridgway (electric motors)|Ridgway]]&lt;ref name="Alden, p.211"&gt;Alden, p.211.&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|300|kW|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="Alden, p.211"/&gt; [[electrical generator]],&lt;ref name="FriedmanSubs1-specs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FriedmanSubs1-p259"/&gt; was provided for charging batteries or for additional [[diesel-electric]] propulsion power.

A more successful propulsion improvement in ''V-4'' was the replacement of earlier submarines' pairs of 60-[[electrochemical cell|cell]] [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] with a pair of 120-cell batteries, thus doubling the available voltage to the electric motors when submerged. This battery configuration would be standard until the [[GUPPY]] program following World War II. ''V-4'' and her sisters were slow in diving and, when submerged, were unwieldy and slower than designed. They also presented an excellent target for surface ship [[sonar]] and had a large turning radius.

Designed primarily as a minelayer, and built at a cost of [[United States dollar|US$]]6,150,000,&lt;ref name="Alden, p.28"/&gt; ''V-4'' was the first and only such specialized type ever built by the United States. She had four [[torpedo tube]]s forward and two minelaying tubes aft. At the time of construction, ''V-4'' was the largest submarine ever built in the U.S., and was the largest in U.S. Navy service for 30 years.&lt;ref name="Alden, p.28"/&gt;

Her minelaying arrangements were "highly ingenious, but extremely complicated",&lt;ref name="Alden, p.28"/&gt; filling two aft compartments.&lt;ref name="Alden, p.28"/&gt; A compensating tube ran down the center of the two spaces, to make up for the lost weight as mines were laid, as well as to store eight additional mines.&lt;ref name="Alden, p.28"/&gt; The other mines were racked in three groups around this tube, two in the fore compartment, one aft,&lt;ref name="Alden, p.28"/&gt; with a hydraulically driven rotating cage between them.&lt;ref name="Alden, p.28"/&gt; Mines were moved by hydraulic worm shafts, the aft racks connecting directly to the launch tubes,&lt;ref name="Alden, p.28"/&gt; which had vertically sliding hydraulic doors&lt;ref name="Alden, p.28"/&gt; (rather than the usual hinged ones of torpedo tubes). Each launch tube was normally loaded with four mines,&lt;ref name="Alden, p.28"/&gt; and a water 'round mines (WRM) tube flooded to compensate as they were laid, then pumped into the compensating tube.&lt;ref&gt;Alden, p.28-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight mines could be laid in 10 minutes.&lt;ref name="Alden, p.29"&gt;Alden, p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interwar period==
Following commissioning, ''V-4'' served with Submarine Division 12 based at [[Newport, Rhode Island]].

She proved perennially underpowered, but engine replacement was postponed by war,&lt;ref name="Alden, p.28"/&gt; and her [[MAN SE|MAN]] diesels were a constant source of trouble.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Clay, Jr. ''Silent Victory'' (Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

In January–February 1929, ''V-4'' underwent a series of trials off [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]]. On a trial dive during this period, she submerged to a depth of {{convert|318|ft|m|abbr=on}}. This mark was the greatest depth an American submarine had reached up to that time. On 26 February 1929, ''V-4'' was assigned to Submarine Division 20 ([[SubDiv]]&amp;nbsp;20), and arrived at [[San Diego, California]] on 23 March. From there, she participated in battle exercises and made cruises along the West Coast.

In 1931, the ''V-4'' was heavily featured in "Seas Beneath", an American action film directed by John Ford.  The ''V-4'' was repainted to appear as a World War I German submarine, the fictional 'U-172'.

''V-4'' was renamed '''''Argonaut''''' on 19 February 1931, and redesignated '''SM-1''' (submarine, minelayer) on 1 July. On 30 June 1932, she arrived at [[Pearl Harbor]], where she was assigned to SubDiv&amp;nbsp;7. She carried out minelaying operations, patrol duty, and other routine work. In October 1934 and again in May 1939, ''Argonaut'' took part in joint Army-Navy exercises in the Hawaiian operating area. ''Argonaut'' became the [[flagship]] of Submarine Squadron 4 ([[SubRon]]&amp;nbsp;4, commanded by [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Freeland A. Daubin]]) in mid-1939 (although a known postmark dated 12/12/38 on an ''Argonaut'' cover [U.S. Submarine Argonaut A-1] reads between the killer bars: FLAGSHIP SQUADRON-4 HAWAII). The submarine returned to the West Coast in April 1941 to participate in fleet tactical exercises.

==World War II==

On 28 November 1941 — ''Argonaut'', commanded by [[Stephen G. Barchet]] — left [[Pearl Harbor]] to patrol around [[Midway Island]] with {{Ship|USS|Trout|SS-202|6}} as Midway Defense Group 7.2.  She was notified by radio of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] when she surfaced a few minutes after sunset on 7 December.  ''Argonaut'' set general quarters two hours later to investigate naval gunfire around Midway.  While designed as a minelayer and not an attack submarine, ''Argonaut'' made the first wartime approach on enemy naval forces; but poor maneuverability prevented reaching a suitable position for surfaced torpedo launch against the two Japanese [[destroyer]]s shelling Midway.  One of the destroyers saw ''Argonaut'' as she dived to make a submerged second approach in the bright moonlight; but the destroyer was unable to locate the submerged submarine, and ''Argonaut'' was again unable to maneuver into position to launch torpedoes.  After being held down all night, ''Argonaut'' surfaced at dawn to recharge batteries and was unsuccessfully bombed by a United States plane from Midway.&lt;ref name=nhm&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Kane |first=Richard H. |year=1996 |title=Not 'Just Practice' |journal=Naval History |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=21–23 |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Argonaut{{'}}s'' dehumidifiers were ineffective at preventing condensation, which caused electrical fires making various pieces of electrical machinery inoperative.  Three crewmen were sick with high fevers, but President Roosevelt's mention of ''Argonaut{{'}}s'' contribution to the war effort in a radio speech encouraged Barchet to resist the temptation to abort the patrol.  By trimming the submarine 17 tons heavy, the crew was able to reduce diving time to 52 seconds by skillfully coordinated pumping between fore and aft ballast tanks; but that time was still considered too slow to avoid hostile aircraft.  ''Argonaut'' successfully rendezvoused with {{Ship|USS|Litchfield|DD-336|6}} at 06:00 20 January 1942, so the destroyer could escort her back to Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref name=nhm/&gt;

===Conversion to troop transport===
On 22 January 1942, she returned to Pearl Harbor and, after a brief stop, proceeded to [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]] for major overhaul. While there, her diesels were replaced with [[General Motors]] [[Electro-Motive Diesel|Winton]] 12-258Ss totaling {{convert|4800|hp|kW|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="Alden, p.29"/&gt; with hydraulic drive through reduction gears,&lt;ref name="Friedman, p. 176"/&gt; and her minelaying gear was removed to prepare for conversion to a troop transport submarine.&lt;ref name="Alden, p.28"/&gt; The auxiliary diesel generator was replaced by a {{convert|300|kW|abbr=on}} GM Winton 8-268A and a {{convert|150|kW|abbr=on}} GM Winton 4-268A.&lt;ref name="Friedman, p. 176"/&gt; She was also fitted with a [[Torpedo Data Computer]]&lt;ref name="Alden, p.29"/&gt; (lack of which likely inhibited her ability to score with torpedoes), new electronics,&lt;ref name="Alden, p.29"/&gt; and two external stern torpedo tubes on the after casing, along with two stern deck stowage tubes. It appears she was not fitted with bow external torpedo tubes, as were ''Narwhal'' and ''Nautilus'', as photos taken after the refit do not show them.&lt;ref name="Alden, p.29"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pigboats.com/subs/v-boats2.html Pigboats.com USS Argonaut page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navsource.org/archives/08/08166c.htm NavSource.org USS Argonaut (SM-1) WW2 photos]&lt;/ref&gt; On return to Pearl Harbor, the conversion to a troop transport submarine was "hastily" finished.&lt;ref name="Alden, p.29"/&gt;

[[File:Makin Island Raid, August 1942.jpg|thumb|A Marine Raider, injured during the Makin operation, is lifted through a hatch on USS ''Argonaut'' to be taken ashore at Pearl Harbor, 26 August 1942.]]

''Argonaut'' returned to action in the South Pacific in August. [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Chester W. Nimitz]] assigned ''Argonaut'' and ''Nautilus'' to transport and land [[Marine Raiders]] on [[Butaritari|Makin Island]] in the [[Gilbert Islands]] for the [[Makin Raid]]. This move was designed to relieve pressure on American forces that had just landed on [[Guadalcanal]]. On 8 August, the two submarines embarked 120&lt;ref name="Alden, p.29"/&gt; troops of Companies A and B, [[Marine Raiders|2nd Raider Battalion]], and got underway for Makin. Conditions during the transit were unpleasant, and most of the marines became seasick. The convoy arrived off Makin on 16 August, and at 03:30 the next day the Marines began landing. Their rubber rafts were swamped by the sea and most of the outboard motors drowned. The Japanese—either forewarned or extraordinarily alert—were ready for the Americans' arrival. Snipers were hidden in the trees, and the landing beaches were in front of the Japanese forces instead of behind them as planned. However, by midnight of 18 August, the Japanese garrison of about 85 men was wiped out; radio stations, fuel, and other supplies and installations were destroyed, and all but 30 of the troops had been recovered.

===Sinking===
''Argonaut'' arrived back in Pearl Harbor on 26 August. Her [[hull classification symbol]] was changed from SM-1 to '''APS-1''' (transport submarine) on 22 September. She was never formally designated '''SS-166''', but that hull number was reserved for her and a photo shows she occasionally displayed it.&lt;ref name="Register"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pigboats.com/subs/v-boats2.html Pigboats.com V-4 page]&lt;/ref&gt; Her base of operations was transferred to [[Brisbane, Queensland]], later in the year. In December, she departed Brisbane under Lieutenant Commander John R. Pierce to patrol the hazardous area between [[New Britain]] and [[Bougainville Island]], south of [[Bismarck Archipelago]]. On 2 January 1943, ''Argonaut'' sank the Japanese [[gunboat]] ''Ebon Maru'' in the Bismarck Sea.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/USN-Chron/USN-Chron-1943.html&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 January, ''Argonaut'' spotted a [[convoy]] of five freighters and their escorting [[destroyer]]s—{{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Maikaze||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Isokaze|1939|2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Hamakaze|1940|2}}—returning to Rabaul from Lae. By chance, an army aircraft—which was out of bombs—was flying overhead and witnessed ''Argonaut''′s attack. A crewman on board the plane saw one destroyer hit by a [[torpedo]], and the destroyers promptly counterattacking. ''Argonaut''′s bow suddenly broke the water at an unusual angle. It was apparent that a [[depth charge]] had severely damaged the submarine. The destroyers continued circling ''Argonaut'', pumping shells into her; she slipped below the waves and was never heard from again.&lt;ref name="Alden, p.29"/&gt; One hundred and two officers and men went down with her, the worst loss of life for an American submarine in wartime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oneternalpatrol.com/uss-argonaut-166.htm |title=On Eternal Patrol - USS Argonaut (APS-1), (SS-166) |last= |first= |website=On Eternal Patrol |publisher= |accessdate=18 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her name was stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 26 February.
[[File:USS Argonaut ships bell.gif|thumb|right|USS Argonaut ships bell|The ship's bell of USS ''Argonaut'' - lost in combat in 1943 -

Japanese reports made available at the end of the war recorded a depth charge attack followed by gunfire, at which time they "destroyed the top of the sub".

On the basis of the report given by the Army flier who witnessed the attack in which ''Argonaut'' perished, she was credited with damaging a Japanese destroyer on her last patrol. (Postwar, the [[JANAC]] accounting gave her none.) Since none of the histories of the three escorting destroyers report damage on 10 January 1943, the destroyer "hit" may have been a [[Mark 14 torpedo|premature explosion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.combinedfleet.com/maikaz_t.htm Maikaze]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.combinedfleet.com/isokaz_t.htm Isokaze]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.combinedfleet.com/hamaka_t.htm Hamakaze]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before her crew left for their third war patrol, they donated Argonaut's bell. Nearly 20 months after her loss, a Submarine Memorial Chapel was built and dedicated on the Submarine Base in Pearl Harbor.  The bell hanging in her steeple comes from Argonaut, and still rings today for services.

'''USS ''Atik'' (AK-101)''' was a [[Q-ship]] of the [[United States Navy]] named for ''al-Atik'', a double star in the [[constellation]] [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]]. Her twin [[sister ship]] was {{USS|Asterion|AK-100|2}}.

==History==
The steel-hulled, single-screw steamer ''Carolyn'' was laid down on 15 March 1912 at [[Newport News, Virginia]], by the [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding]] and Dry Dock Company, for the A.K. Bull Steamship Lines; launched on 3 July 1912, sponsored by Ms. Carolyn Bull (for whom the ship was probably named), a granddaughter of the shipping firm's owner, Archibald Hilton Bull (1847–1920), and delivered on 20 July 1912.

For the next 30 years, ''Carolyn'' carried freight and passengers between the [[West Indies]] and ports on the eastern seaboard of the U.S. During [[World War I]], she received a main battery of one {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} and one {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} gun, and a Navy armed guard detachment served in the ship from 28 June 1917– 11 November 1918. During that time, too, the Navy gave her the identification Id. No. 1608, but did not take her over for naval service.

''Carolyn'' pursued her prosaic calling under the house flag of the Bull Line through the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. A dispatch dated 31 January 1942 expressed the [[Chief of Naval Operations]]' desire that ''Evelyn'' and ''Carolyn'' "be given a preliminary conversion to AK (cargo ship) in the shortest possible time." A letter from the Chief of the Bureau of Ships elaborated on the "shortest possible time," when it stated on 12 February that the conversion and outfitting of the vessels was desired "by 1 March 1942." Acquired by the Navy from the Maritime Commission, ''Carolyn'' steamed to [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], where she was turned over to the Navy under a bareboat charter at 15:30 on 12 February 1942.

As could be expected, the process of converting two venerable tramp steamers into men-of-war was by no means complete, but over the next few weeks the two erstwhile "tramps" were given their main and secondary batteries as well as sound gear; nevertheless, they appeared to be mere cargo ships. ''Carolyn'' became ''Atik'', and was given a cargo ship hull number, AK-101; ''Evelyn'' became ''Asterion'' (AK-100). They were to use their old identities when communicating with friendly vessels and stations; if enemy ships should challenge, reply should be made in accordance with International Procedure, using the identification SS ''Vill Franca'', of Portuguese Registry, callsign CSBT.

''Atik'' (AK-101) was placed in commission at 16:45 on 5 March 1942, at the [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]], [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] [[Harry Lynnwood Hicks]], USN, in command.

At the outset, all connected with the program apparently harbored the view that neither ship "was expected to last longer than a month after commencement of [her] assigned duty." ''Atik''{{'}}s holds were packed with pulpwood, a somewhat mercurial material. If dry, "an explosive condition might well develop and, if wet, "rot, with resultant fire, might well take place." Despite these disadvantages, pulpwood was selected as the best obtainable material to assure "floatability."

''Atik''{{'}}s mission was to lure some unsuspecting U-boat into making a [[torpedo]] attack. According to the projected scenario, the submarine, having deemed the tramp unworthy of the expenditure of more torpedoes, would surface to sink the crippled foe with gunfire.

The plan presupposed that supporting forces would come to the rescue whenever a Q-ship ran into difficulties. In March 1942, though, there was no such reserve available. The [[commanding officer]]s of the two ships were told that they could expect little help if they got into trouble. Every available combatant ship and plane was employed in convoy and patrol duties.

Following fitting out and brief sea trials, she and ''Asterion'' got underway on 23 March 1942.  Soon after leaving port, ''Atik'' and ''Asterion'' went their separate ways. On the night of 26–27 March, she was cruising about {{convert|300|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Norfolk, Virginia]] and ''Asterion'' was cruising some {{convert|240|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south of this area.

===Action===
At 19:45 Eastern War Time, UT-4 (note that some accounts use German Winter Time, UT+1), on the night of 26 March, the Duty Officer in the Joint Operations Control Room, Eastern Sea Frontier (ESF), was informed that an SOS had been picked up from an unidentified ship which had been torpedoed.  Nothing further.

''Atik'' had attracted the attention of {{GS|U-123|1940|2}}, on her second war patrol off the eastern seaboard. The U-boat, on the surface, began stalking ''Atik'' at 17:00, and at 19:37 fired one torpedo from {{convert|700|yd|m|abbr=on}} away which struck the ship on her [[Port (nautical)|port side]], under the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. Fire broke out immediately, and the ship began to assume a slight [[List (watercraft)|list]].

At 20:53, radio stations at [[Manasquan, New Jersey]], and at [[Fire Island, New York]], intercepted the distress message:
:SSS SOS Lat. 36-00&amp;nbsp;N, Long. 70-00&amp;nbsp;W, ''Carolyn'' burning forward, not bad.
Two minutes later, a second distress message further amplified:
:Torpedo attack, burning forward; require assistance.

As ''U-123'' proceeded around under her victim's stern, her captain, ''Kapitänleutnant'' [[Reinhard Hardegen]], noted one boat being lowered on the starboard side and men abandoning ship.

Because such attacks were a regular occurrences at this time and because all available surface craft were on patrol the dispatch from ''Carolyn'' produced no immediate action. The Duty Officer in the Control Room had not been informed as to the secret nature of ''Carolyn'', and consequently his only action was to forward the dispatch to Commander-in-Chief, [[United States Fleet]] (COMINCH).

"Carolyn" was not dead&amp;mdash;yet. After ''U-123'' turned to starboard, ''Atik'' gathered steerage way, paralleling her course by turning to starboard as well, and dropped her concealment, commencing fire from her main and secondary batteries. The first shell dropped short of the U-boat, as she made off presenting a small target; the others were off in deflection. A veritable hail of .50-caliber machine gun fire, though, ricochetted around the U-boat's decks as she put on speed to escape the trap into which Hardegen had fallen. One bullet mortally wounded a midshipman standing watch on ''U-123'''s bridge.

Gradually, the U-boat pulled out of range behind the cover of a smoke screen emitted by her straining diesels, and her captain assessed the damage. As he later recorded, "We had been incredibly lucky."

''U-123'' submerged and again approached her opponent. At 21:29, the U-boat shot a torpedo into ''Atik''{{'}}s machinery spaces. Satisfied that this blow would be fatal, ''U-123'' stood off and watched as ''Atik'' settled by the bow, her single screw now out of the water.

Once again, ''Atik''{{'}}s crew could be seen embarking in her boats, as their ship clung stubbornly to the surface. ''U-123'' surfaced at 22:27, confident that ''Atik'' was no longer a threat, and continued to watch until 22:50, when a cataclysmic explosion blew her to pieces. Ten minutes later, ''U-123'' buried her only casualty, the midshipman killed by the Q-ship's machine gun fire. ''Atik''{{'}}s entire crew perished, either in the blast or during the severe gale that blew up soon after the ship disintegrated.

Several hours after receiving the report of the SOS, an officer in Cominch Operations room phoned the Duty Officer and asked if the Commander, Eastern Sea Frontier (CESF), or the Chief of Staff had been notified. They had not. The Duty Officer was informed that they should be, immediately. Because CESF and his Chief of Staff were both in Norfolk on that particular night, the Duty Officer notified the Operations Officer at his home.

Early the next morning, an [[United States Army|Army]] [[bomber]] was sent to search the area from which ''Carolyn'' had sent her distress message; the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Noa|DD-343|2}} and the [[Tugboat|tug]] {{USS|Sagamore|AT-20|2}} were sent to assist. The Army bomber returned without having sighted anything. The tug and the destroyer encountered such heavy weather that ''Sagamore'' was recalled; ''Noa'' searched the area until fuel shortage compelled her to return to New York on 30 March. Other flights were unsuccessful until 30 March, when two Army planes and one [[PBY Catalina|PBY-5A Catalina]] [[flying boat]] out of Norfolk reported that they had sighted wreckage roughly ten miles south of the original reported position.

''Asterion'' had intercepted the distress messages from ''Atik'' and proceeded directly to the area, Lieutenant Commander Legwen deeming his orders "sufficiently broad to proceed immediately to her assistance," but ''Asterion'' encountered difficulties with her steering gear, and only continued the search for 24 hours before being forced to put into [[Hampton Roads]] for repairs.

The [[Norway|Norwegian]] freighter {{MS|Minerva|1930|6}} was sighted in the vicinity, southbound for [[St. Thomas, Virgin Islands]]. On her arrival there, she was boarded and interrogation revealed that her crew had sighted no wreckage and had picked up no survivors.

Twelve days later, CESF reported all known details to COMINCH on the "suspected sinking of the SS ''Carolyn''," and concluded: "...it is believed that there is very little chance that any of her officers and crew will be recovered. It is therefore recommended that if no further information is received by 27 April, they be considered lost and that next of kin be notified."

On 9 April, Radio Berlin reported that a U-boat had sunk an adversary. The [[Associated Press]] distributed the announcement and it was printed in the ''[[New York Times]]'' the next day.

:The High Command said today that a Q-boat – a heavily armed ship disguised as an unarmed vessel – was among 13 vessels sunk off the American Atlantic coast and that it was sent to the bottom by a submarine only after a "bitter battle." (In the last war, Q-ships accounted for many submarines which slipped up on them thinking they were easy prey. When the submarines came into range, false structures on the Q-boats were collapsed, revealing an array of guns.)

:The Q-boat, the communiqué said, was of 3,000&amp;nbsp;tons and was sunk by a torpedo after a battle "fought partly on the surface with artillery and partly beneath the water with bombs and torpedoes."

As of 2014, no other ships in the United States Navy have been named ''Atik''.

'''Ultras''' are a fictional offshoot of humanity (like [[Marvel Comics]]' superhuman [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]) who first appeared in the [[Malibu Comics]] [[Ultraverse]] comic book line.

==Fictional history==
Long before humanity evolved, an alien [[starship]] exploded in the [[Solar System]]; the main body of the spaceship landed on Earth, the core of the ship impacted on the [[Moon]]. The Earth component leaked its component [[molecular nanotechnology|nanotechnology]] into the environment, where it contaminated and combined with living [[DNA]]. The core which had fallen on the Moon (which later became known as the [[Entity (comics)|Entity from the Moon]]) gradually repaired itself and sent out pulses of energy to signal the main section of the spaceship; since humans now incorporated this alien technology in their genes, the pulses or "jumpstarts" had an unforeseen side-effect. Some humans developed [[superhuman]] powers; these individuals became known as Ultras. A number of the Ultraverse's superheroes share this origin.

[[File:Nowa Huta jako idealne socjalistyczne miasto.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Nowa Huta]] in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]], serves as an unfinished example of a Utopian [[ideal city]].]]

A '''utopia''' ({{IPAc-en|j|uː|ˈ|t|oʊ|p|i|ə}} {{respell|yoo|TOH|pee|ə}}) is an imagined [[community]] or [[society]] that possesses highly desirable or nearly perfect qualities for its citizens.&lt;ref name="Giroux, H. 2003. pp. 91-105"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Giroux |first=Henry A. |authorlink=Henry  Giroux |date=2003 |title=Utopian thinking under the sign of neoliberalism: Towards a critical pedagogy of educated hope |url=https://uniteyouthdublin.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/giroux-utopian-thinking-under-the-sign-of-neoliberalism-towards-a-critical-pedagogy-of-e.pdf |journal=[[Democracy &amp; Nature]] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=91–105 |doi=10.1080/1085566032000074968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;Simandan, D., 2011. Kinds of environments—a framework for reflecting on the possible contours of a better world. The Canadian Geographer/Le Géographe canadien, 55(3), pp.383-386. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-0064.2010.00334.x/full&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of a utopia is a [[dystopia]]. One could also say that utopia is a perfect "place" that has been designed so there are no problems.

Utopia focuses on equality in [[economics]], [[government]] and [[justice]], though by no means exclusively, with the method and structure of proposed implementation varying based on ideology.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giroux, H. 2003. pp.91-105"&gt;Giroux, H., 2003. Utopian thinking under the sign of neoliberalism: Towards a critical pedagogy of educated hope. Democracy &amp; Nature, 9(1), pp.91-105.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lyman Tower Sargent "there are socialist, capitalist, monarchical, democratic, anarchist, ecological, feminist, patriarchal, egalitarian, hierarchical, racist, left-wing, right-wing, reformist, [[Naturism|Naturists]]/[[Naturist Christians|Nude Christians]], free love, nuclear family, extended family, gay, lesbian, and many more utopias [...] Utopianism, some argue, is essential for the improvement of the human condition. But if used wrongly, it becomes dangerous. Utopia has an inherent contradictory nature here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lyman Tower Sargent|title=Utopianism: A Very Short Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xgA69UImZu8C&amp;pg=PA21 |date=23 September 2010 |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-957340-0 |pages=21 |doi=10.1093/actrade/9780199573400.003.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sargent argues that utopia's nature is inherently contradictory, because societies are not homogenous, and have desires which conflict and therefore cannot simultaneously be satisfied.  If any two desires cannot be simultaneously satisfied, true utopia cannot be attained because in utopia all desires are satisfied.

The term ''[[Wiktionary:utopia|utopia]]'' was coined from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] by [[Sir Thomas More]] for his 1516 book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', describing a [[fictional island]] society in the south [[Atlantic Ocean]] off the coast of [[South America]].

The word comes from {{lang-el|οὐ}} ("not") and τόπος ("place") and means "no-place", and strictly describes any non-existent society 'described in considerable detail'. However, in standard usage, the word's meaning has [[semantic change|narrowed]] and now usually describes a non-existent society that is intended to be viewed as considerably better than contemporary society.&lt;ref name="Thinking Utopia"&gt;{{cite report|periodical=Thinking Utopia: Steps Into Other Worlds|pages=11|first=Sargent|last=Lyman Tower|title=The Necessity of Utopian Thinking: A Cross-National Perspective|editor1-last=Rüsen|editor1-first=Jörn |editor2-last=Fehr|editor2-first=Michael|editor3-last=Reiger|editor3-first=Thomas W.|year=2005|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9781571814401|location=New York, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eutopia'', derived from Greek εὖ ("good" or "well") and τόπος ("place"), means "good place", and is strictly speaking the correct term to describe a positive utopia. In [[English language|English]], ''eutopia'' and ''utopia'' are homophonous, which may have given rise to the change in meaning.&lt;ref name="Thinking Utopia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Utopian Reality: Reconstructing Culture in Revolutionary Russia and Beyond|last=Lodder|first=C.|last2=Kokkori|first2=M|last3=Mileeva|first3=M|pages=1–9|isbn=9789004263208|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV|location=Leiden, The Netherlands|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights - The Earthly Paradise (Garden of Eden).jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|Left panel (The Earthly Paradise – [[Garden of Eden]]) from [[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''.]]
Chronologically, the first recorded Utopian proposal is [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;More, Travis; Rohith Vinod
(1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Part conversation, part fictional depiction, and part policy proposal, ''Republic'' would categorize citizens into a rigid class structure of "golden," "silver," "bronze" and "iron" socioeconomic classes. The golden citizens are trained in a rigorous 50-year-long educational program to be benign oligarchs, the "philosopher-kings."  Plato stressed this structure many times in statements, and in his published works, such as the ''Republic''.  The wisdom of these rulers will supposedly eliminate poverty and deprivation through fairly distributed resources, though the details on how to do this are unclear.  The educational program for the rulers is the central notion of the proposal.  It has few laws, no [[lawyer]]s and rarely sends its citizens to war, but hires [[mercenary|mercenaries]] from among its war-prone neighbors.  These mercenaries were deliberately sent into dangerous situations in the hope that the more warlike populations of all surrounding countries will be weeded out, leaving peaceful peoples.

During the 16th century, Thomas More's book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' proposed an ideal society of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item126618.html|title=Thomas More's Utopia|website=www.bl.uk|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers, including Utopian socialists, have chosen to accept this imaginary society as the realistic blueprint for a working nation, while others have postulated that Thomas More intended nothing of the sort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utopiaanddystopia.com/utopia/utopian-socialism/|title=Utopian Socialism - The Utopian Socialism Movement |website=www.utopiaanddystopia.com |accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that More's ''Utopia'' functions only on the level of a satire, a work intended to reveal more about the [[England]] of his time than about an idealistic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dalley |first=Jan |url=https://www.ft.com/content/73b9bed6-a7ea-11e5-955c-1e1d6de94879 |title=Openings: Going back to Utopia |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=30 December 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is bolstered by the title of the book and nation, and its apparent confusion between the Greek for "no place" and "good place": "utopia" is a compound of the syllable ou-, meaning "no", and topos, meaning place. But the [[Homophone|homophonic]] prefix eu-, meaning "good," also resonates in the word, with the implication that the perfectly "good place" is really "no place."

===Ecological===
Ecological utopian society describes new ways in which society should relate to nature.
These works [[ecotopia|perceive]] a widening gap between the modern Western way of living that destroys nature&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Andrew G. (2007). ''Counterculture green: the Whole earth catalog and American environmentalism''. University Press of Kansas. p. 86. {{ISBN|978-0-7006-1545-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a more traditional way of living before industrialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecotopia 2121: A Vision of our Future Green Utopia|last=For example, see: Marshall|first=Alan|publisher=Arcade Publishers|year=2016|isbn=9781628726145|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological utopias may advocate a society that is more sustainable. According to the Dutch philosopher Marius de Geus, ecological utopias could be inspirational sources for movements involving [[green politics]].&lt;ref&gt;Geus, Marius de (1996). Ecologische utopieën- Ecotopia's en het milieudebat. Uitgeverij Jan van Arkel.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
Particularly in the early 19th century, several utopian ideas arose, often in response to the belief that social disruption was created and caused by the development of [[commercialism]] and [[capitalism]]. These ideas are often grouped in a greater "[[utopian socialism|utopian socialist]]" movement, due to their shared characteristics.  A once common characteristic is an [[egalitarian]] distribution of goods, frequently with the total abolition of [[money]]. Citizens only do [[labour (economics)|work]] which they enjoy and which is for the [[common good]], leaving them with ample time for the cultivation of the arts and sciences. One classic example of such a utopia was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s ''[[Looking Backward]]''. Another socialist utopia is [[William Morris]]'s ''[[News from Nowhere]]'', written partially in response to the top-down ([[bureaucratic]]) nature of Bellamy's utopia, which Morris criticized. However, as the socialist movement developed, it moved away from utopianism; [[Marx]] in particular became a harsh critic of earlier socialism he described as utopian. (For more information, see the [[History of Socialism]] article.) In a materialist utopian society, the economy is perfect; there is no inflation, and only perfect social and financial equality exists.

In 1905, [[H.G. Wells]] published ''[[A Modern Utopia]]'', which was widely read and admired and provoked much discussion. Also consider [[Eric Frank Russell]]'s book ''[[The Great Explosion]]'' (1963) whose last section details an economic and social utopia. This forms the first mention of the idea of [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] (LETS).

During the "[[Khrushchev Thaw]]" period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/the-Thaw-Soviet-cultural-history|title=the Thaw - Soviet cultural history|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Soviet writer [[Ivan Yefremov|Ivan Efremov]] produced the science-fiction utopia ''[[Andromeda (novel)|Andromeda]]'' (1957) in which a major cultural thaw took place: humanity communicates with a galaxy-wide Great Circle and develops its technology and culture within a social framework characterized by vigorous competition between alternative philosophies.

The English political philosopher [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], author of the utopian work [[The Commonwealth of Oceana]], published in 1656, inspired English [[Country Party (Britain)|country party]] republicanism and was influential in the design of three American colonies. His theories ultimately contributed to the idealistic principles of the American Founders. The colonies of [[Province of Carolina|Carolina]] (founded in 1670), [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] (founded in 1681), and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] (founded in 1733) were the only three English colonies in America that were planned as utopian societies with an integrated physical, economic, and social design. At the heart of the plan for Georgia was a concept of “agrarian equality” in which land was allocated equally and additional land acquisition through purchase or inheritance was prohibited; the plan was an early step toward the yeoman republic later envisioned by Thomas Jefferson.&lt;ref&gt;Fries, Sylvia, ''The Urban Idea in Colonial America'', Chapters 3 and 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Home, Robert, ''Of Planting and Planning: The Making of British Colonial Cities'', 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Thomas, ''The Oglethorpe Plan'', Chapters 1 and 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The communes of the 1960s in the United States were often an attempt to greatly improve the way humans live together in communities. The back-to-the-land movements and hippies inspired many to try to live in peace and harmony on farms, remote areas, and to set up new types of governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brbl-archive.library.yale.edu/exhibitions/utopia/uc22.html|title=America and the Utopian Dream - Utopian Communities|website=brbl-archive.library.yale.edu|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communes like [[Kaliflower Commune|Kaliflower]], which existed between 1967 and 1973, attempted to live outside of society's norms and create their own ideal communist based society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://secure.pmpress.org/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=432|title=For All the People: Uncovering the Hidden History of Cooperation, Cooperative Movements, and Communalism in America, 2nd Edition|website=secure.pmpress.org|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intentional communities]] were organized and built all over the world with the hope of making a more perfect way of living together. While many of these new small communities failed, some are growing, such as the [[Twelve Tribes Communities]] that started in the United States. Since its start, it has now grown into many groups around the world.

===Religious utopias===
[[File:New Harmony by F. Bate (View of a Community, as proposed by Robert Owen) printed 1838.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]], a Utopian attempt; depicted as proposed by [[Robert Owen]].]]

==== Inter-religious utopias ====
The inter-religious utopia is similar to a form of [[multiculturalism]] where real-world cultures have successfully worked together to create a wider society based on shared values. A transparent ideology of God and religion in an inter-religious utopia is how many people envision [[God]] manifesting within such a community.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In more extended theories, the formula goes up to the next level, with different [[religious leader]]s setting aside their differences and accepting harmony, peace and understanding to unite all [[religion]]s with one another.  Other inter-religious utopias may go even further by describing a religion where humans become God or merge with a primal force that reigned before the birth of the [[universe]]. Religion and God could be used as self-motivating factors for people to believe in and to raise themselves out of difficult situations.

==== Intra-religious utopias ====
In the United States and Europe, during the [[Second Great Awakening]] (ca. 1790–1840) and thereafter, many radical religious groups formed utopian societies in which [[faith]] could govern all aspects of members' lives. These utopian societies included the [[Shakers]], who originated in England in the 18th century and arrived in America in 1774. A number of religious utopian societies from Europe came to the United States from the 18th century throughout the 19th century, including the Society of the Woman in the Wilderness (led by [[Johannes Kelpius]] (1667–1708)), the [[Ephrata Cloister]] (established in 1732), and the [[Harmony Society]], among others.  The [[Harmony Society]] was a [[Christian theosophy]] and [[Pietism|pietist]] group founded in [[Iptingen]], [[Germany]], in 1785. Due to religious persecution by the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]] and the government in [[Württemberg]],&lt;ref name="Sutton1"&gt;Robert Paul Sutton, ''Communal Utopias and the American Experience: Religious Communities'' (2003) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; the society moved to the United States on October 7, 1803, settled in [[Pennsylvania]].  On February 15, 1805, about 400 followers formally organized the Harmony Society, placing all their goods in common. The group lasted until 1905, making it one of the longest-running financially successful communes in American history. The [[Oneida Community]], founded by [[John Humphrey Noyes]] in [[Oneida, New York]], was a utopian religious [[commune]] that lasted from 1848 to 1881. Although this utopian experiment has become better known today for its manufacture of Oneida silverware, it was one of the longest-running communes in American history. The [[Amana Colonies]] were communal settlements in [[Iowa]], started by radical German [[pietists]], which lasted from 1855 to 1932. The [[Amana Corporation]], manufacturer of refrigerators and household appliances, was originally started by the group. Other examples are [[Fountain Grove, California|Fountain Grove]] (founded in 1875), Riker's Holy City and other Californian utopian colonies between 1855 and 1955 (Hine), as well as Sointula&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Finnish Utopian Settlements in North America | author = Teuvo Peltoniemi | url = http://www.sosiomedia.fi/utopia/na_settlements.pdf | publisher = sosiomedia.fi | year = 1984 | accessdate = 2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[British Columbia]], Canada. The [[Amish]] and [[Hutterites]] can also be considered an attempt towards religious utopia.  A wide variety of [[intentional communities]] with some type of faith-based ideas have also started across the world.

The [[Book of Revelation]] in the Christian [[Bible]] depicts an [[Christian eschatology|eschatological]] time with the defeat of [[Satan]] and of evil.

===Science and technology===
[[File:Early flight 02561u (2).jpg|thumb|Utopian flying machines, France, 1890-1900 (chromolithograph [[trading card]]).]]

Though [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''New Atlantis'' is imbued with a scientific spirit, scientific and technological utopias tend to be based in the future, when it is believed that advanced [[science]] and [[technology]] will allow utopian [[living standards]]; for example, the absence of [[death]] and [[suffering]]; changes in [[human nature]] and the [[human condition]]. Technology has affected the way humans have lived to such an extent that normal functions, like sleep, eating or even reproduction, have been replaced by artificial means. Other examples include a society where humans have struck a balance with technology and it is merely used to enhance the human living condition (e.g. ''[[Star Trek]]''). In place of the static perfection of a utopia, [[libertarian transhumanist]]s envision an "[[extropianism|extropia]]", an open, evolving society allowing individuals and voluntary groupings to form the institutions and social forms they prefer.

[[Mariah Utsawa]] presented a theoretical basis for [[technological utopianism]] and set out to develop a variety of technologies ranging from maps to designs for cars and houses which might lead to the development of such a utopia.

One notable example of a technological and [[libertarian socialist]] utopia is Scottish author [[Iain Banks]]' [[The Culture|Culture]].

Opposing this [[optimism]] is the prediction that advanced science and technology will, through deliberate misuse or accident, cause environmental damage or even humanity's [[extinction]]. Critics, such as [[Jacques Ellul]] and [[Timothy Mitchell]] advocate [[precautionary principle|precautions]] against the premature embrace of new technologies.  Both raise questions about changing responsibility and freedom brought by [[division of labour]]. Authors such as [[John Zerzan]] and [[Derrick Jensen]] consider that modern technology is progressively depriving humans of their autonomy, and advocate the collapse of the industrial civilization, in favor of small-scale organization, as a necessary path to avoid the threat of technology on human freedom and [[sustainability]].

There are many examples of techno-dystopias portrayed in mainstream culture, such as the classics ''[[Brave New World]]'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]],'' often published as "1984", which have explored some of these topics.

===Feminism===
Utopias have been used to explore the ramifications of genders being either a societal construct, or a biologically "hard-wired" imperative, or some mix of the two.&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1442&gt;{{cite book |title= Women's Studies Encyclopedia|last=Tierney |first=Helen |authorlink=  |year= 1999|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|page=1442 |isbn=978-0-313-31073-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socialist and economic utopias have tended to take the "woman question" seriously, and often to offer some form of equality between the sexes as part and parcel of their vision, whether this be by addressing misogyny, reorganizing society along separatist lines, creating a certain kind of androgynous equality that ignores gender, or in some other manner. For example, [[Edward Bellamy]]'s ''[[Looking Backward]]'' (1887) responded, progressively for his day, to the contemporary women's suffrage and women's rights movements. Bellamy supported these movements by incorporating the equality of women and men into his utopian world's structure, albeit by consigning women to a separate sphere of light industrial activity (due to women's  lesser physical strength), and making various exceptions for them in order to make room for (and to praise) motherhood. One of the earlier feminist utopias that imagines complete separatism is [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'' (1915).

In [[Gender in speculative fiction|science fiction and technological speculation]], gender can be challenged on the biological as well as the social level. [[Marge Piercy]]'s ''[[Woman on the Edge of Time]]'' portrays equality between the genders and complete equality in sexuality (regardless of the gender of the lovers).  Birth-giving, often felt as the divider that cannot be avoided in discussions of women's rights and roles, has been shifted onto elaborate biological machinery that functions to offer an enriched embryonic experience,  When a child is born, it spends most of its time in the children's ward with peers. Three "mothers" per child are the norm, and they are chosen in a gender neutral way (men as well as women may become "mothers") on the basis of their experience and ability. Technological advances also make possible the freeing of women from childbearing in [[Shulamith Firestone]]'s ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]''. The fictional aliens in [[Mary Gentle]]'s ''Golden Witchbreed'' start out as gender-neutral children and do not develop into men and women until puberty, and gender has no bearing on social roles. In contrast, [[Doris Lessing]]'s ''[[The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five]]'' (1980) suggests that men's and women's values are inherent to the sexes and cannot be changed, making a compromise between them essential. In ''My Own Utopia'' (1961) by [[Elizabeth Mann Borghese]], gender exists but is dependent upon age rather than sex&amp;nbsp;— genderless children mature into women, some of whom eventually become men.&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1442/&gt; "[[William Moulton Marston|William Marston]]'s [[Wonder Woman]] comics of the 1940s featured Paradise Island, also known as [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], a matriarchal all-female community of peace, loving submission, bondage, and giant space kangaroos."&lt;ref&gt;Noah Berlatsky, "Imagine There's No Gender: The Long History of Feminist Utopian Literature," ''The Atlantic,'' April 15, 2013. https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/04/imagine-theres-no-gender-the-long-history-of-feminist-utopian-literature/274993/&lt;/ref&gt;

Utopian [[single-gender worlds]] or single-sex societies have long been one of the primary ways to explore implications of gender and gender-differences.&lt;ref name=DGinSF13/&gt; In speculative fiction, female-only worlds have been imagined to come about by the action of disease that wipes out men, along with the development of technological or mystical method that allow female [[parthenogenic]] [[reproduction]]. Charlotte Perkins Gilman's 1915 novel approaches this type of separate society. Many feminist utopias pondering separatism were written in the 1970s, as a response to the [[Lesbian separatism|Lesbian separatist movement]];&lt;ref name=DGinSF13&gt;Attebery, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=erotic1189&gt;[[Gaétan Brulotte]] &amp; John Phillips,''Encyclopedia of Erotic Literature'', "Science Fiction and Fantasy", CRC Press, 2006, p. 1189, {{ISBN|1-57958-441-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =Utop101/&gt; examples include [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[The Female Man]]'' and [[Suzy McKee Charnas]]'s ''[[Walk to the End of the World]]'' and ''[[Motherlines]]''.&lt;ref name =Utop101&gt;Martha A. Bartter, ''The Utopian Fantastic'', "Momutes", Robin Anne Reid, p.101 {{ISBN|0-313-31635-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utopias imagined by male authors have often included equality between sexes, rather than separation, although as noted Bellamy's strategy includes a certain amount of "separate but equal".&lt;ref name =Utop102&gt;Martha A. Bartter, ''The Utopian Fantastic'', "Momutes", Robin Anne Reid, p. 102 ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of female-only worlds allows the exploration of female independence and freedom from [[patriarchy]]. The societies may be lesbian, such as ''[[Daughters of a Coral Dawn]]'' by [[Katherine V. Forrest]], or not, and may not be sexual at all&amp;nbsp;— a famous early sexless example being ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'' (1915) by [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]].&lt;ref name=erotic1189/&gt; Charlene Ball writes in ''Women's Studies Encyclopedia'' that use of speculative fiction to explore gender roles in future societies has been more common in the United States compared to Europe and elsewhere,&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1442/&gt; although such efforts as [[Gerd Brantenberg]]'s ''Egalia's Daughters'' and [[Christa Wolf]]'s portrayal of the land of Colchis in her ''Medea: Voices ''are certainly as influential and famous as any of the American feminist utopias.

===Utopianism===
[[File:Goldenes-Zeitalter-1530-2.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|''[[The Golden Age (Cranach)|The Golden Age]]'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]].]]
In many cultures, societies, and religions, there is some myth or memory of a distant past when humankind lived in a primitive and simple state, but at the same time one of perfect happiness and fulfillment. In those days, the various [[mythology|myth]]s tell us, there was an instinctive harmony between humanity and nature. People's needs were few and their desires limited. Both were easily satisfied by the abundance provided by nature. Accordingly, there were no motives whatsoever for war or oppression. Nor was there any need for hard and painful work. Humans were simple and [[piety|pious]], and felt themselves close to their God or gods. According to one anthropological theory, hunter-gatherers were the [[original affluent society]].

These mythical or religious archetypes are inscribed in many cultures, and resurge with special vitality when people are in difficult and critical times. However, in utopias, the projection of the myth does not take place towards the remote past, but either towards the future or towards distant and fictional places, imagining that at some time in the future, at some point in space, or beyond death, there must exist the possibility of living happily.

These myths of the earliest stage of humankind have been referred to by various cultures, societies, and religions:

====Golden Age====

The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] poet [[Hesiod]], around the 8th century BC, in his compilation of the mythological tradition (the poem ''[[Works and Days]]''), explained that, prior to [[Ages of Man|the present era]], there were four other progressively more perfect ones, the oldest of which was the [[Golden Age]].

[[Plutarch]], the Greek historian and biographer of the 1st century, dealt with the blissful and mythic past of the humanity.

====Arcadia====

From [[Sir Philip Sidney]]'s prose romance ''[[Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia|The Old Arcadia]]'' (1580), originally a region in the [[Peloponnesus]], [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] became a [[synonym]] for any rural area that serves as a [[pastoral]] setting, a ''locus amoenus'' ("delightful place").

====The Biblical Garden of Eden====

The [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]] [[Garden of Eden]] as depicted in the [[Old Testament]] [[Bible]]'s [[Book of Genesis]] 2 ([[King James Version of the Bible|Authorized Version of 1611]]):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the [[Tree of life (biblical)|tree of life]] also in the midst of the garden, and the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|tree of knowledge of good and evil]]. [...]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. [...]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; [...] And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; and the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the exegesis that the biblical theologian [[Herbert Haag]] proposes in the book ''Is original sin in Scripture?'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haag |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Haag |title=Is original sin in Scripture? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zO_YAAAAMAAJ |year=1969 |publisher=[[Sheed and Ward]] |location=New York}} [[German language|German]] or. ed.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=EnWRSQAACAAJ 1966].&lt;/ref&gt; published soon after the [[Second Vatican Council]], {{bibleref2|Genesis 2:25||NIV}} would indicate that [[Adam and Eve]] were created from the beginning naked of the [[divine grace]], an originary grace that, then, they would never have had and even less would have lost due to the subsequent events narrated. On the other hand, while supporting a continuity in the Bible about the absence of [[preternatural]] gifts ({{lang-la|dona praeternaturalia}})&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Haag, Herbert (1966). pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nUMaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22dona+praeternaturalia%22 9, 49ff.]&lt;/ref&gt; with regard to the [[Serpents in the Bible#Eden|ophitic event]], Haag never makes any reference to the discontinuity of the loss of access to the tree of life.

====The Land of Cockaigne====

The Land of [[Cockaigne]] (also Cockaygne, Cokaygne), was an imaginary land of idleness and luxury, famous in medieval stories, and the subject of several poems, one of which, an early translation of a 13th-century French work, is given in [[George Ellis (poet)|George Ellis']] ''Specimens of Early English Poets''. In this, "the houses were made of barley sugar and cakes, the streets were paved with pastry, and the shops supplied goods for nothing."  London has been so called (see [[Cockney#Cockaigne|Cockney]]), but Boileau applies the same to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Cobham Brewer E. ''Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'', Odhams, London, 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Peach Blossom Spring====
The [[Peach Blossom Spring]], a prose written by the Chinese writer [[Tao Yuanming]] (c. 220 - 589 CE), describes a utopian place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Tian| first=Xiaofei| title=The Cambridge History of Chinese Literature| year=2010| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge| isbn=978-0-521-85558-7| page=221| chapter=From the Eastern Jin through the Early Tang (317–649)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Berkowitz| first=Alan J.| title=Patterns of Disengagement: the Practice and Portrayal of Reclusion in Early Medieval China| year=2000| publisher=Stanford University Press| location=Stanford| isbn=978-0-8047-3603-9| page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative goes that a fisherman from Wuling sailed upstream a river and came across a beautiful blossoming peach grove and lush green fields covered with blossom petals.&lt;ref name=zh182&gt;{{cite book| last=Longxi| first=Zhang| title=Allegoresis: Reading Canonical Literature East and West| year=2005| publisher=Cornell University Press| location=Ithaca| isbn=978-0-8014-4369-5| page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entranced by the beauty, he continued upstream.&lt;ref name=zh182/&gt; When he reached the end of the river, he stumbled onto a small grotto.&lt;ref name=zh182/&gt; Though narrow at first, he was able to squeeze through the passage and discovered an ethereal utopia, where the people led an ideal existence in harmony with nature.&lt;ref name=zh182-3&gt;{{cite book| last=Longxi| first=Zhang| title=Allegoresis: Reading Canonical Literature East and West| year=2005| publisher=Cornell University Press| location=Ithaca| isbn=978-0-8014-4369-5| pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw a vast expanse of fertile lands, clear ponds, mulberry trees, bamboo groves, and the like with a community of people of all ages and houses in neat rows.&lt;ref name=zh182-3/&gt; The people explained that their ancestors escaped to this place during the civil unrest of the [[Qin dynasty]] and they themselves had not left since or had contact with anyone from the outside.&lt;ref name=zh183&gt;{{cite book| last=Longxi| first=Zhang| title=Allegoresis: Reading Canonical Literature East and West| year=2005| publisher=Cornell University Press| location=Ithaca| isbn=978-0-8014-4369-5| pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had not even heard of the later dynasties of bygone times or the then-current [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]].&lt;ref name=zh183/&gt; In the story, the community was secluded and unaffected by the troubles of the outside world.&lt;ref name=zh183/&gt; The sense of timelessness was also predominant in the story as a perfect utopian community remains unchanged, that is, it had no decline nor the need to improve.&lt;ref name=zh183/&gt; Eventually, the Chinese term ''Peach Blossom Spring'' (桃花源) came to be synonymous for the concept of utopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Gu| first=Ming Dong| title=Chinese Theories of Fiction: A Non-Western Narrative System| year=2006| publisher=State University of New York Press| location=Albany| isbn=978-0-7914-6815-9| page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Datong====

[[Great Unity|Datong]] is a traditional Chinese Utopia.  The main description of it is found in the Chinese [[Classic of Rites]], in the chapter called "Li Yun" (禮運).  Later, Datong and its ideal of 'The World Belongs to Everyone/The World is Held in Common' 'Tianxia weigong/天下为公' 'influenced modern Chinese reformers and revolutionaries, such as [[Kang Youwei]].

====Schlaraffenland====

[[Schlaraffenland]] is an analogous German tradition.

All these myths also express some hope that the [[idyll]]ic state of affairs they describe is not irretrievably and irrevocably lost to mankind, that it can be regained in some way or other.

One way might be a quest for an "earthly paradise"—a place like [[Shangri-La]], hidden in the [[Tibet]]an mountains and described by [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]] in his utopian novel ''[[Lost Horizon (novel)|Lost Horizon]]'' (1933). [[Christopher Columbus]] followed directly in this tradition in his belief that he had found the Garden of Eden when, towards the end of the 15th century, he first encountered the [[New World]] and its indigenous inhabitants.

'''Walter Otto Davis''' (29 September 1888 – 20 May 1937) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] professional [[association football|footballer]] who played at [[centre forward]] for [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] for ten years in the 1910s. He also made five appearances for the [[Wales national football team|Welsh national team]].

==Football career==

Davis was born in [[Mold, Flintshire]],&lt;ref name="The men who've shaped Millwall"&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://www.millwall.vitalfootball.co.uk/sitepage.asp?a=520521| title = The men who've shaped Millwall| publisher = vitalfootball.co.uk| accessdate = 5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of six brothers.&lt;ref name = "Garland"&gt;{{cite book |title=Who's Who of Welsh International Soccer Players |last1=Davies |first1=Gareth |last2=Garland |first2=Ian |year=1991 |publisher=Bridge Books |isbn=1-872424-11-2|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second name came from a German soldier who was a friend of his father.&lt;ref name = "Garland"/&gt;

When he was still a child, his family moved to London, where his father, W.J. Davis, became an [[alderman]] in [[County Borough of West Ham|West Ham]] and chairman of the governors of the Municipal Central Secondary School in Tennyson Road&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Elementary Education |url=http://historyofstratford.co.uk/WestHam%20History/West%20Ham%201912%20Directory.shtml|work=West Ham 1912 Kellys Trade Directory in Essex|publisher=History of Stratford, West Ham, Canning Town, Silvertown etc|accessdate=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; before serving as the mayor in 1920–21.&lt;ref name = "Garland"/&gt;

When one of his brothers died whilst playing in a junior football match at [[Leytonstone]], his parents ordered Walter to stop playing football. After he joined the army, he joined the 2nd [[Bedfordshire Regiment]] and was stationed in [[Gibraltar]] where he played football for the Army. On leaving the army in 1911, he joined Metrogas, but turned professional with [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name = "Garland"/&gt; In January 1912, he scored Millwall's only goal in their [[FA Cup]] First Round match at First Division [[Bury F.C.|Bury]].&lt;ref name = "Collett"&gt;{{cite book | title= The Complete Record of the FA Cup|last= Collett|first= Mike |year= 2003|publisher= Sports Books |isbn=1-899807-19-5 |page=423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis was a deadly finisher, with exceptional speed and ball control and in the 1912–13 season, he emerged as a "goalscoring sensation" and soon attracted "fabulous offers" from [[Football League]] clubs.&lt;ref name = "Garland"/&gt; He was the Lions' leading goalscorer in each season he played, and he holds the record as Millwall's leading goalscorer in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]. Davis was a wonderful dribbler with a fine body swerve, but also had a fierce shot from almost any distance.&lt;ref name="The men who've shaped Millwall"/&gt;

In 1914, Millwall again came up against First Division opposition in the FA Cup, with Davis scoring the only goal against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the [[1913–14 FA Cup#First round proper|First Round]] replay. He scored again against [[Bradford City F.C.|Bradford City]] in [[1913–14 FA Cup#Second Round Proper|Round Two]], before going out to yet another club from the First Division, [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].&lt;ref name = "Collett"/&gt; The goal he scored against Bradford was considered by many to be the best ever scored at [[The Den (defunct stadium)|The Den]]&lt;ref name = "Garland"/&gt; and was described by the national papers as a "wonder goal"; he received the ball from a throw-in around the half-way line, sidestepped his marker, beat both full-backs and then slipped the ball past the keeper into the net.&lt;ref name="The men who've shaped Millwall"/&gt; [[1914–15 FA Cup#Second Round Proper|The following season]], Davis again scored against opponents from the [[Football League First Division]], but [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] went through after a second replay.&lt;ref name = "Collett"/&gt;

Davis was called up by [[Wales national football team|Wales]], making his debut in a 1–0 victory against [[Ireland national football team (1882–1950)|Ireland]] on 18 January 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ireland 0 Wales 1|url=http://www.wfda.co.uk/international_details.php?id=103|publisher=Welsh Football Data Archive|accessdate=6 October 2010|date=18 January 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retained his place for the next four matches, scoring a goal from 30 yards against [[England national football team|England]] at Bristol on 17 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England 4 Wales 3|url=http://www.wfda.co.uk/international_details.php?id=105 |publisher=Welsh Football Data Archive|accessdate=6 October 2010|date=17 March 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also represented the Southern League several times and won a London Challenge Cup and two Kent Senior Shield medals in his time at Millwall.&lt;ref name="The men who've shaped Millwall"/&gt;

==Later career and death==
During [[World War I]], Davis served in Italy where he incurred injuries to his legs.&lt;ref name="The men who've shaped Millwall"/&gt; During the war he occasionally turned out for Millwall, including in a match against [[Clapton Orient F.C.|Clapton Orient]] in which he scored a [[hat-trick]] wearing army boots.&lt;ref name = "Garland"/&gt;

Davis was forced to retire from football early in 1919 as a result of an injury to his knee and took up employment as a groundsman with [[Chelmsford F.C.|Chelmsford]], before working as a labourer in the [[London Docks]].&lt;ref name = "Garland"/&gt; He was found drowned in [[Bow Creek (England)|Bow Creek]] on 20 May 1937 in mysterious circumstances as he was a strong swimmer.&lt;ref name="The men who've shaped Millwall"/&gt; The [[coroner]]'s jury recorded an [[open verdict]].&lt;ref name = "Garland"/&gt;

==International appearances==
Davis made five appearances for Wales in international matches, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Complete Wales FC 1876–2008 |last=Samuel |first=Bill |year=2009 |publisher=Soccer Books |isbn=1-86223-176-1|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
